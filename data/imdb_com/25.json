Two kingdoms have joined through the planned marriage of Princess Lyssa (Lysette Anthony) and Prince Colwyn (Ken Marshall). At the wedding, the forces of The Beast attack, kidnapping the princess, and massacring everyone else. Sole survivor Colwyn joins with a band of disparate characters on a quest to kill The Beast and rescue the princess.\n\nThis is a very simple good versus evil storyline. It&apos;s a quest road movie. David Battley is especially funny as the incompetent magician Ergo. All the iconic characters are there including the great Alun Armstrong as the bandit leader Torquil. And sharp eyes will see a younger Liam Neeson.\n\nThis along with Dragonslayer is my favorite British fantasy of that era. The stories are original and yet comfortably familiar. It had the FX but CG would soon make the miniature models and real sets old school. It didn&apos;t help that Return of the Jedi came out right before this. This movie has great cheese appeal, but is outclassed in production value by Jedi.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite being close to thirty years old, Wes Craven&apos;s &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; maintains a distinct raw intensity - far surpassing the level of terror seen in horror films today. The plot in a nutshell; a family on vacation ventures from the main road, ends up stranded in the desert, and falls prey to a malevolent clan of inbred cannibals. Though the story idea may be far from original - it is the atmosphere, directorial style, and acting that raise the overall credibility of the film. The low budget and claustrophobic desert setting creates a sense of dread permeating throughout the entire film; while the grainy look of the print adds a sense of realism to the unfolding events. With a brisk running time of only 89 minutes the film doesn&apos;t waste a moment in setting the mood - then when all hell breaks loose it is unrelenting until the final scene. The actors portraying the Carter family bring sufficient emotional range to their characterizations, making it clearly evident that this a normal family being tested beyond the boundaries of civilized nature. It is also worth noting the performances by the actors who play Pluto and Mars (two of the baddies) - these characters are portrayed as both sadistic and devoid of any sympathy. Although the DVD print is grainy (as mentioned above), it is THE definitive version of the film and is thousands of times an improvement over the quality of the video release; quite amazing for a low budget film of this nature. Grim, violent, and symbolic; it is an amazing piece of 70&apos;s exploitation horror. &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; is a classic in every sense of the word, and receives an 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This film by Fellini is basically the female version of 8 1/2. Instead of delving into the mind of a middle-aged Italian man dealing with problems with his wife and trying to figure out who he really is, it is about a middle-aged Italian woman dealing with problems with her cheating husband and trying to figure out who she really is. (I still can&apos;t decide who I like more as a lead in a Fellini film... Masina or Mastroianni.) The film is very enjoyable, and is definitely one of the films I would classify as a work of art. The one thing that really stands out to me, however, is this: It could only exist as a film. Most films are adapted from previously written novels, or at the very least can suffer the indignation of a &quot;novelization&quot; without losing the quality of the story. But I cannot fathom any way a writer could capture this film with words. It is very visual, but could not be painted or drawn either. I think this is one of the few films I&apos;ve seen that is completely unique to the medium of film. Towards the end of the film, there is a scene where she is trying to avoid voices and images around her while hosting a party. It was at this point that I realized how perfectly every shot was set-up, and that there would be no way anyone could capture the feeling or the images with words.\n\nI would be extremely fascinated to see what the shooting script to this film looked like. It&apos;s the fifth Fellini film I&apos;ve seen, and I must say, I think I can call him my favorite director. He&apos;s the only director whom I&apos;ve been enthralled by every single film I&apos;ve seen of his. He has a perfect record, 1.000% batting average so far with me. I&apos;m going to keep seeing more, and hopefully I won&apos;t ever be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie, as I think most people have these days, on the out of print Academy Home Entertainment videotape under the title Slashed Dreams. I doubt that is the original title, as it appears on the screen via a bad video effect, and appears to be blocking out the original title by being placed on a large green rectangle (probably Sunburst). The videotape dates from 1986, and since Robert Englund (who later played Freddy Kreuger) appears in it (albeit briefly, towards the end), the title is probably meant to suggest A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984). None of the actors&apos; names are mentioned on the box, although my box was cut, so maybe the names just got cut off. &quot;Slashed Dreams&quot; is probably also meant to suggest slasher films, but this is at most a proto-slasher; nobody gets killed, and the only slashing is of one bad guy by another.\n\nThe video box suggests that the movie starts with a skinny-dipping scene, with the characters watched by someone with a knife, and then flashes back to how they got there. In fact, it&apos;s entirely presented in chronological order, starting with a bunch of young people in college. In a class, they talk about the meaning of life, and where people have their roots; &quot;in the earth,&quot; one suggests, &quot;in heaven,&quot; suggests another.\n\nOne of the students, Jenny, brings up her friend Michael, who&apos;d dropped out of college and moved into the mountains. Her boyfriend doesn&apos;t think much of a dropout, and he doesn&apos;t like Jenny&apos;s lifelong brainy friend either. At a frat party, her boyfriend gets really belligerent, and Jenny and her old friend drive off to find Michael.\n\nOn the way, they get directions at a country store. The proprietor is found in a back room, rehearsing his night club act (he says), talking and singing on a microphone. He&apos;s a former radio star who&apos;s been forgotten (played by the crooner Rudy Vallee). He&apos;s about the most chipper old man to ever warn a couple of young people not to go in the woods! He presses some Licorice Nips on them, and tries to impress on them the need for a knife.\n\nThey pass on the knife, and make their way into the woods, where they encounter a bear, and find a cabin they think might be Michael&apos;s. It&apos;s made out of rather thin branches, so that it is possible to see right through the walls. There are also windows, and at least two large holes in the roof, so that when they say they wish they could lock the door, it sounds rather funny!\n\nThere&apos;s an odd sort of rape scene, in which one of the assailants seems to be at most dry humping a sleeping bag (and he couldn&apos;t get it up either, we learn), and the other also seems to be doing some dry humping, but also does some bruising face-slapping. Later, some strange advice is given to the victim, to &quot;push the demons out&quot; and to find some &quot;truth&quot; in what happened.\n\nThe movie ends with one of the characters taking a slim illustrated hardcover book down from a shelf in Michael&apos;s cabin, and reading: &quot;Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.... And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.&quot; These are two different passages (on pain, and on friendship) from Kahlil Gibran&apos;s popular (more then than now, I think) book The Prophet.\n\nNot much of a horror movie, and may not have been intended to be one. Between the opening scenes in the college classroom, and the reading from The Prophet, and some of the dialogue in between, it seems the filmmakers may have been trying to reach for something meaningful, but...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Die Stadt ohne Juden&quot; (&quot;The Nation without Jews&quot;) is a weird political allegory, almost a fantasy. It has no supernatural elements, yet still feels like a fantasy due to its air of unreality. The story seems very far-fetched, and yet - in light of what actually happened to the Jews in Europe only a few years after this film was made -  this far-fetched story is less extreme than the bizarre reality of the Holocaust. This film goes a long way towards making the Holocaust look dull and boring.\n\nThe film takes place in the far-future world of 1976, in the faraway city of Vientria. The good burghers of Vientria have just passed a new law, expelling all the Jews from their city. Leo Strakosch, a local Jew, is betrothed to the fair Lotte, a Gentile. Reluctantly complying with the law, Leo prepares to leave Vientria, but he confidently tells Lotte that he will return for her soon.\n\nA few years pass. Without the contributions of its former Jewish citizens, the city of Vientria has now plunged into economic depression and artistic stagnation. (Unfortunately, this fits the anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews secretly control the economy.) With the entire city in decline, the burghers are starting to consider rescinding the law and allowing the Jews to return.\n\nOne Jew has already returned to Vientria: Leo Strakosch, wearing a ridiculous black moustache which is apparently meant to disguise him as a Gentile, but which only makes him look more Jewish. Posing as a non-Jew, Strakosch now gets involved in local politics and stands for office, hoping to get elected to the city&apos;s council so that he can rescind the law against the Jews.\n\n&quot;Die Stadt ohne Juden&quot; features dull acting, ponderous photography, and very little of genuine interest. A title card at the beginning of the film identifies the year as 1976, but everything looks like 1924. This film is preaching to the choir. In 1924, a few people were already aware of the growing trend of European anti-Semitism and its danger to everyone. But most adults in 1924 either didn&apos;t give a damn about European Jews, or actively supported the politicians who advocated &quot;relocation&quot; of unwanted Jewish citizens.\n\nI&apos;ll give this film high marks for good intentions but very low marks for actual execution: one point out of 10."

Here&apos;s what I don&apos;t understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7,000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies. Yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money, and they churn out a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: &quot;It&apos;s &apos;Road Warrior&apos; but it&apos;s like a future Western. We&apos;ll get the cheapest &apos;actors&apos; we can find, we&apos;ll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script, and we&apos;ll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions.

      "name": "One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended",
      "reviewBody": "James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I&apos;m concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.\n\nIn 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie&apos;s run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in &apos;hypersleep&apos; for 57 years. &quot;I promised her I&apos;d be home for her 11th birthday,&quot; cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character&apos;s depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She&apos;s seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn&apos;t elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.\n\nAliens is a unique film experience: it&apos;s genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there&apos;s disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it&apos;s really meaningless. In Aliens&apos; case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don&apos;t see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it&apos;s a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone&apos;s survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we&apos;re really concerned for their well-being. We don&apos;t want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I&apos;m always truly bummed out when it happens.\n\nFilled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it&apos;s action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it&apos;s really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don&apos;t see why anyone should view the other version instead.\n\nMy rating: 10/10",

This film was released in 1978 2 years after the first and it tells the story of Damien the Anti-Christ who is now age 12 he is starting to understand his duty in the line of Satan whilst a strange crow eliminates any people who know his real identity and are seen enemies in the eyes of Satan. This film is not the best in the Omen series but it is a very watchable film, it isn&apos;t a film that will bore you to death and it isn&apos;t a film that will keep you on the end of your seat for 100 minutes but i do recommend it to the people who are interested in these films it is a clever entry in the omen franchise \n\n***/*****",

      "reviewBody": "Reading the other reviews, I see that homophobes have been duly warned about this movie, so I won&apos;t say anything about the relationship between the two men beyond that it is complex and beautiful.\n\nWhat interests me more for the purposes of this little blurb is that no one has commented on how the &quot;film within a film&quot; (much like the &quot;play within a play&quot; in Hamlet) reflects the actual events unfolding in the prison cell. Molina (William Hurt) is ostensibly retelling his favorite film to entertain Valentin (Raul Julia) and make the time pass more quickly, but he himself admits that he &quot;embroiders&quot; the story to make it more real.  So who is to say if this film exists except in Molina&apos;s mind, and if it does, what really transpired in the film?  The story about the French woman who is in love with a German officer during World War II, and must decide whether or not to betray him, is an obvious parallel to Molina&apos;s decision to betray Valentin or not.  Even Molina says that he most identifies with Leni La Maison (Sonia Braga) in this film of his, and it&apos;s not just because he is a drag queen. It&apos;s because he has to choose between the man he loves and &quot;patriotism&quot; (in his case, represented by the police/government as well as his ailing mother).\n\nThis storytelling tactic works brilliantly, in my opinion.  Kiss of the Spider Woman is indeed original, quirky, and a must-see.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone knows about the calm that happens before the storm. In &quot;Seeking A Friend for the End of the World&quot;, what&apos;s amazing is just how long that calm lasts.\n\nThroughout the first part of this film, you can&apos;t help but wonder, as you watch, how you would react if you heard nonchalant reports on radio and TV about a 70-mile wide asteroid heading for Earth and destroying life as we know it. Would you seek refuge in a fallout shelter and hope for the best, or say &quot;To hell with it!&quot; and do all the things you couldn&apos;t do when there was established order with a purpose?\n\nDodge (Steve Carell) seems to find a third option no one else even tries to consider: sitting calmly and maintaining his own order as virtually everyone else is participating in an orgy or a riot. While being calm works for him as a survival instinct, it also reflects his loneliness. The more people surrounding him, the lonelier he seems.\n\nVery similar to Bill Murray&apos;s character in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, Carell is great at conveying so much despite doing so little. It becomes all the more fascinating when he&apos;s the only character in the movie who does not throw caution into the wind. After all, would you be this calm if the world was going to end?\n\nKeira Knightley is Penny, a vibrant but distraught British woman who lives in the same building as Dodge. She appears one night outside his window, and is frantically crying after her realization that she can&apos;t fly back home to Great Britain to see her family. Knightley serves as a great contrast to Carell in many ways, and she is a welcome presence in this movie. And I am SO glad the film didn&apos;t try to cover her sweet British accent.\n\nThe film evolves into a sort of road-trip movie when a riot ensues outside their apartment building, and Dodge persuades Penny to drive to Somerset, Delaware because he knows someone who owns an airplane. As it turns out, Dodge also had a high school girlfriend who wrote to him a few months earlier, before his wife left him.\n\nSounds like a familiar journey from another movie? Well, &quot;Seeking A Friend For The End of the World&quot; takes you in one direction you think you&apos;re going, and then often makes a sharp left when you least expect it. The movie is also funnier than the title suggests, has some startling moments I never saw coming nor expected, and keeps you watching for many reasons.\n\nIs there a love story between Dodge and Penny? Like the recent &quot;Salmon Fishing In The Yemen&quot; (2012), you find yourself unsure if the two main characters should fall in love, or if there is at least a little attraction, or if it really makes any difference.\n\nThere are other things you wonder while watching this movie. Most notably, is the world really going to end? Everyone in this movie seems to think so. While it&apos;s fascinating to see how different characters react to the news, you keep watching because you want to see if it really does. It can&apos;t be a dream or a delusion, can it?\n\nIt&apos;s great that in a summer season of action flicks and disaster films, there&apos;s one film that takes its time showing how ordinary people react to extraordinary things. There&apos;s an asteroid headed towards Earth, but there are no explosions, deaths, astronauts, superheroes, or even (surprisingly) camera shots of the sky in this movie whatsoever. Moviegoers who hated &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998) will be relieved, I&apos;m sure.\n\nBesides Carell and Knightley, other fairly well-known actors show up so briefly, their appearances could practically be considered cameos. Still, every performance by everyone involved stays with you to the point where you probably pinpoint one character and say, &quot;Yeah, I&apos;d probably be THAT guy given the circumstances&quot;. As the doomsday clock counts down and the movie ends, you may find yourself reevaluating what you want the last image in your mind to be before it&apos;s all over.",

      "reviewBody": "Other reviewers have noted that &quot;Up in Arms&quot; was the first major movie that launched Danny Kaye&apos;s star. It certainly is a foretaste of the versatile Kaye&apos;s many talents. It includes a couple tongue-twister sequences, a couple of other language impersonations, and just a little song and dance. But, none of these are at the accomplished level Kaye would reach and show in films that followed. What he is good at in this career opener, he is fantastic at in films such as &quot;The Inspector General&quot; of 1949, &quot;On the Riviera&quot; of 1951, &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; of 1954, and &quot;The Court Jester&quot; of 1955.\n\nVenues to showcase talents like Kaye don&apos;t have to have great plots. Films such as this are good and enjoyable just for the entertainment of the star or stars. But, when films also have interesting stories, they often click better and enhance the viewing enjoyment. At least I find that so in Kaye films. With much better scripts in those later movies, he moved more naturally and smoothly into his tongue twisters, impersonations, or song and dance numbers.\n\n&quot;Up in Arms&quot; doesn&apos;t have a very solid plot. So, it seemed to me a number of times that the producers forced the next Kaye sequence on us. Like an old-fashioned entertainment break between scenes in an otherwise not-too-good stage show. Those few who praise this film as among Kaye&apos;s best had best watch again those films I named above. His impersonations, tongue twisters, and song and dance advanced remarkably in just a few years as he perfected his talents in each of these fields. Still, it is his comic performance alone that earns this movie seven stars in my book. Dinah Shore&apos;s singing supported the film some, but otherwise I think the cast was lackluster. Dana Andrews had more than a dozen movies under his belt, and would rise to become a leading man and male co-star in many films of the late 1940s and 1950s. But, he did not fit in comedies or musicals. He&apos;s clearly out of place here.\n\nOne other thing that struck me, with the rich Technicolor for such an early film, was the makeup worn by the ladies. In the musical scene with everyone boarding a ship, all the WAC nurses line up along the ship railing. As the camera pans their pretty faces, their heavy use of makeup really stands out. That may have been a sign of the times, and I appreciate the lesser use of pancake makeup in modern days. Our sharp lenses and cameras can give us very close shots that show the natural beauty of the human face. I think the pancake would be obvious and not very enticing.\n\nHere are some favorite lines from this film.\n\nDanny Weems, &quot;Say, what&apos;s the matter with that horse of yours? He keeps breathing in all the time - never breathes out?&quot; The Milkman, &quot;Well, I&apos;ll tell you, Bub. But I don&apos;t want it to get around. He isn&apos;t really a horse. He&apos;s a vacuum cleaner.&quot;\n\nDanny, &quot;You know, if I don&apos;t get a rest petty soon, I&apos;m gonna have to have an operation.&quot; Joe Nelson, &quot;They can&apos;t operate on you, Junior. With all those pills inside of you, you&apos;d roll off the table.&quot;\n\nSgt. Gelsey, looking at some of the 100 plus nurses sunbathing and sitting in their special deck area aboard the ship, &quot;We never had anything like this in the last war.&quot; Info Jones, Sergeant, we don&apos;t have anything like it in this war either.&quot;\n\nNavy nurse (Goldwyn Girl, June Lang, uncredited), &quot;Gosh, how can a guy who looks like a canary turn out to be a wolf?&quot;",

The split screen is easy to adjust to and really wraps you in, you&apos;re quite fascinated to see what these two people will do next. I loved the set up; it lent itself to a nice surprise for the audience and felt completely natural.\n\nWhat really shines in this movie is the dialog...it&apos;s some of the most brilliant original dialog between two people with a shared past that I&apos;ve ever heard. During the Q&amp;A afterward, I was actually a bit disappointed the director didn&apos;t give the screenwriter more credit for her amazing script (which she wrote in three weeks). It&apos;s so engaging and natural, you might guess it was improvised...but 99% came directly off the page. \n\nHelena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckel really landed plum roles for themselves in this story and I&apos;ve never loved them more than here. The reviewer who thought Helena was miscast is way off in his perception. It&apos;s not about wedding sexual tension (good grief) and it&apos;s far from a chick flick...it&apos;s about the deep connection between two people regardless of time and similar to &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; etc., yet quite different, but I don&apos;t want to spoil it. \n\nThe film is touching, very humorous, and deeply thoughtful. You will want to watch it several times to catch all that happens.",

Narrated by Orson Welles (and later by Hemingway) the documentary shows rural and urban Spanish life in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. With striking scenes of the bare and wide land the film highlights people working and interacting and the trials and tragedies they had to go through all vividly showing a nation in turmoil as they try to get by in tumultuous times. Slow-going and lacking the pizazz that films of this kind should have the importance of this historical artifact nonetheless overrides whatever shortcomings the movie has. A visual time travel to one of the most momentuous and tragic periods in world history &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot; is priceless as it is important.",

He tried to copy the feeling several times since then (1985!!!).\n\nThe film is a sarcastic but charming point of view about the communist era in the 70&apos;s or 80&apos;s. The banning of eroticism, the concept of pointless producing at all costs. The manager and the supervising fireman of the box factory lure customers by installing a fire-protection camera system throughout the factory including the women&apos;s dressing room. But when the ladies find it out...\n\nThe strange camera handling (most of the shots and the movements are filmed backwards, and then reversed, giving the characters a funny behaviour) and the non-realistic conversations and phrases make the film extraordinary and funny. Most of the ideas in the film were contrived during the filming by the whole crew. And let&apos;s not forget about the great actors who make this film complete and perfect!",

      "reviewBody": "I read in an Abhishek interview that when he was initially presented with the JBJ story idea (while shooting Bunty babli) it was set in a Delhi train station platform......i can just about imagine the charming scene. Abhishek and his heroine chatting over a cup of chai next to the tea stall. How did that potentially charming romantic tale turn into this over the top Bollywood film based in London? Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was an utter disappointment to me considering the same banner and director came out with the thoroughly entertaining Bunty Aur Babli. The movie felt like a 2hr long music video/ fashion show. I felt the person who would get the most mileage out of the movie would be the fashion designer/stylist of the movie which had a lot of outlandish costumes none more so than the attire of the Big B in the title song.\n\nThe first half felt awkward although there were a few funny moments thanks to the Lara and Abhishek. The movie picks up in the 2nd half but it was more due to the performances of the actors rather than the progression of the story. The actors did a relatively good job considering the weak script. I felt Lara Dutta and Bobby Deol were the standout performers from the movie as they had the opportunity to portray characters that had different shades to it. Lara was especially cute with the French accent and the potty mouth of the 2nd half. Bobby had some excellent comic moments in the 2nd half. Abhishek took a bit of a risk by playing such a loud character...he does go a bit over the top at times but I still think he is a good actor and he has his moments. For me Preity Zinta has been repeating herself in all her movies recently (except maybe Lakshya)...ever since Kal Ho Na Ho, she seems to be playing the same character over and over again i.e. an Indian who is either born and brought up abroad or living abroad. She too improves only in the 2nd half when she is not trying to put on an accent. There was not enough chemistry between the lead pair although you could see that they are buddies.\n\nThe music was excellent although Shaad Ali managed to drag all life out of the catchy title song since it pops up all over the film. The slow romantic number was also good.\n\nI feel that Yash Raj films are catering more to the NRI crowd with their movies and subsequently took the soul out of this movie by presenting on this enormous scale.. you cant really blame them as it is a business and they need to recoup their costs.\n\nThe film has its moments but it is in no way anything more than an average product.",

We have more tests in this than other movies. Though I do not remember how many there were in the 36 chambers of Shaolin. Before you say duh, 36 obviously ... nope, apparently they did not do the whole chambers. Hey you have to give the guys (and viewers) a few breaks of course.\n\n18 Bronzemen - I did not count how many in people we saw in this - covered in Gold or painted Gold rather than Bronze, but as you may have figured out yourself, Goldmen does not have the same ring to it. The movie itself has quite the strange story to it. It did not make it to the US cinemas - the sequel did. Being called part 1 when it did at first.\n\nHistory of that aside, this also had different versions flying around. No pun intended. The two main ones (Japanese was the one that went international) are on a recent UK release. The real cut is being cut together from many sources so may not have the highest standards.\n\nThe Japanese cut is quite strange, integrating stuff from other movies from Kuo. If you are into the Kung Fu stuff, you could do far worse than this. Of course you could also do better. Still more than fine movie, even if you only watch the bit uncomprehensible international cut - with added/other kid actors at the beginning and other editing choices that may seem curious.",

His last movie was the incredible &quot;Cache&quot;.\n\nSome of the set-ups are wonderful...who cares if some have been done before...and some are fresh and all are done with glee and panache. In fact all of the actors seem to be having fun.\n\nOne great aspect of this movie is that there is character development ... several characters are forever changed, for the better, by the end of the movie. \n\nI have no qualms about recommending this movie to friends and film buffs alike.

      "reviewBody": "Well-done big screen adaptation of the Stephen King novel is one of the most acclaimed King-based films ever, and rightfully so.\n\nSchool teacher awakens from a five year coma to discover that he has the power to see into a person&apos;s past or future trauma by merely touching them.\n\nThe story that drives this solid thriller is a well-rounded and often moving character study. It&apos;s a compelling tale with some great sequences of suspense and the occasional good jolt. Director David Cronenberg delivers splendidly well-shot sequences in this film, as well as a nice atmospheric kind of bleakness that&apos;s completely in tune with our story. The music score is also quite beautiful.\n\nThe cast is the best highlight however. Star Christopher Walken does perhaps one of his best performances as our tormented hero, whom we build quite a bond with. Brook Adams is quite good as Walken&apos;s lost love. Martin Sheen is impressive as a sinister politician. Tom Skerritt and Colleen Dewhurst are also good in their small roles.\n\nAll around The Dead Zone is a wonderful film, even if you&apos;re not a fan of Stephen King.\n\nRemade as a TV series in 2002\n\n*** 1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Along with Guddu, English Babu Desi Mem is known to be one of Shahrukh Khan&apos;s worst films. It is. The movie starts with a melodramatic sequence which is a kind of a prologue to the entire story. One couple dies upon the birth of their son. The deceased wife&apos;s little sister decides to bring this baby up all alone. Right after that it moves several years forward and we are presented with a young Sonali Bendre dancing in a bar. Her nephew Nandu is now 8 years old and she works hard to feed him. But Vikram Mayur, Nandu&apos;s paternal uncle, has come to India to take the kid to England, as he is the successor of their dynasty. That&apos;s the basic story of this movie, and it just does not work. Maybe it&apos;s got to do something with the fact that we expect more from Khan and his movies. Khan himself is pretty good and as expected he has a great chemistry with the leading lady. Sonali Bendre is very pretty and she does a fairly good job as well. The kid is okay. The film&apos;s music does not add that much. English Babu Desi Mem has its moments, but they are few and are not enough to make a watchable film. If anything, this one is worthy of a one-time watch and nothing more.",

      "reviewBody": "I just watched this movie in my Advanced Developmental Psychology class, and I was blown away by it.  Naturally, the professor warned us that the film contained some very graphic scenes, as it certainly did.  There were moments where I absolutely could not look up at the screen.  The film is wonderfully directed (by Anjelica Huston) and acted.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of the best performances of her career.  She&apos;s one of those actresses who has talent and I have nothing against her, but rarely do I find myself raving about her performances.  Here, she&apos;s given a genuinely challenging role, as she has to be both disturbed by her new husband&apos;s abuse towards her daughter, yet at the same time deeply in love with him.  My class is predominantly female, so most of the girls were groaning and yelling out things like &quot;You&apos;re stupid!&quot; when she kept deciding to get back with the creep.  But it&apos;s easy to say that while you&apos;re sitting on your butt looking at a TV screen.  Tons of women get into relationships with abusive husbands, and guys who treat them like crap, and how many of them actually get out of those relationships?  Love is a strange, strange thing.  There&apos;s no way to explain it.  But I didn&apos;t feel it was in any way inaccurate for Leigh&apos;s character to keep wanting to get back with Ron Eldard.\n\n I know Eldard from his role on the cancelled sitcom &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; and his supporting roles in films like &quot;Sleepers&quot; and &quot;The Last Supper.&quot; Prior to this movie, I would&apos;ve never envisioned him in this sort of role, as I didn&apos;t really think of him as a daring, intense actor.  I would envision an actor like Ray Liotta or James Woods in this sort of role.  But I think Eldard&apos;s apparent naivete really gives dimension to this role.  He doesn&apos;t in any way appear like someone who would act abusive towards anyone, as it usually turns out in real life.  He also plays the character with a certain charm, which gives us some insight into why Leigh decided to stay with him. Of course, he never gets a handle on the Carolina accent (at times even sounding like an Englishman, as he struggles so hard), but as I got more and more into the film, I barely paid attention to the flaws in his accent. After watching this film, I will definitely look at Eldard much differently, as much more than the fun-loving buddy of Rob Schneider on &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; (a show I used to watch pretty frequently).\n\nThe cast is also composed of fine character actors, like Glenne Headley and Michael Rooker--who&apos;s absolutely terrific as Leigh&apos;s short-fused brother. Of course, that isn&apos;t an unusual role for him, but he plays it very well and packs a great dramatic punch in this performance especially.  Jena Malone shows why she grew up to star in big films like &quot;Stepmom&quot; and &quot;For Love of the Game.&quot;  Even at this age, she is fully convincing as a tortured young girl.  I just kept on wondering what the director gave her as motivation for her different emotions, since I&apos;m guessing they couldn&apos;t outwardly address the issues or rape and abuse to a girl of her age.\n\nThe film contains some of the most disturbing scenes in American cinema (I stress the word &quot;American,&quot; because I&apos;ve seen more graphic rape scenes in foreign films like &quot;The Bandit Queen&quot; and &quot;Pixote&quot;), so even those with stomachs of steel should beware.  But how many films you watch really get you talking and thinking, and send you an emotional journey--without using cheap shots?  I don&apos;t have A.D.D. or anything, but rarely do I get so lost in a film that my attention never drifts and I never take time to look at my watch.  This is one of those rare powerful, touching films that I will never forget!\n\nMy score:  9 (out of 10)",

I&apos;ve heard they won the best picture award, and I am so happy knowing that. I&apos;m also expecting a lot more internationally competitive movie from gma pictures and from Director Zig Dulay. Hoping that this good quality movie continues. I am not really a big fan of Filipino dramas and movies and now due to my friend&apos;s recommendation to watch this, I am so glad that had the opportunity to appreciate the Flipino made masterpiece. Thank you to all who made this movie.",

In my opinion, I think this is one of the best films of the year so far. \n\nWith that said, it is not a film for children. It is not a film meant to portray ideal role models for children. It IS a film meant to realistically depict the lives of people who live at the very bottom of America&apos;s socioeconomic ladder. \n\nIf you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own, you will probably not like this film. In order to appreciate it, you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical ambiguities of these characters.\n\nSo if anyone feels unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world, but still feels curious enough to see it, take a cue from the Anthropologists... \n\nWhen studying a culture vastly different than your own, make sure to leave the rights and wrongs of your society at home. Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical standards of your world upon another&apos;s, you&apos;ve sacrificed your objectivity. And by doing so, miss the very point of empathy.",

      "reviewBody": "Unusual film, in that there is no title role as such, and we never do get to meet Otar. We are transported into the everyday lives of three generations of women - grandmother Eka, her daughter Marina, and granddaughter Ada - in their home in what is the genteel decay of Tblisi in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The scene is set with a clever portrayal of relationships between the three, with the typical small household tensions that normally arise. \n\nBut the common favourite in this extended family group is Eka&apos;s son, Otar, who is in Paris, making his own way in the world, and regularly contacting those at home by phone and letter. Eka, especially, lives for these contacts from her Otar, so when word reaches the other two that he has been killed in an industrial accident, Marina decides to conceal the fact from her mother and play the lie that he is still alive. Two influencing factors come through regarding that choice of action - firstly, Marina is unsure her mother would survive the shock of hearing of Otar&apos;s death, but secondly, we suspect Marina herself is unable to summon the courage to pass on the news. Ada unwillingly agrees to all of this at first, but it becomes an increasing burden on both of them as you would expect. Otar&apos;s workmate, Niko, turns up at the Tblisi residence with a suitcase of his personal effects, but Ada manages to convey to him the existence of the lie they are playing before he can reveal Otar&apos;s demise in the grandmother&apos;s presence. Old Eka is no fool though, and you get the impression she knows all is not as it should be. In a rash moment, she decides to take a trip to France to see her Otar, sells the few family heirlooms of value, and purchases three tickets for them all to travel to Paris. The viewer knows that eventually she will become aware that Otar is dead, but the manner of this, and her reaction towards her daughter and granddaughter, are quite unpredictable and beautiful. It is from here on that she proves to be the tower of strength for the other two. Another nice twist awaits us at the film&apos;s conclusion. This is a film full of poignant moments and the stuff of life, and coupled with superb acting by the three attractive women one can only endorse its 2003 Grand Prize at Cannes.",

Though not an immediate champion of justice, neither is Tom indifferent to the suffering of others and gradually he finds himself being drawn into the lives of several of the local residents.\n\nIt is the leader of the Souls gang, &apos;Angel&apos;, with his determination to maintain his grip on his turf, and interloper Tom, with his stubborn refusal to abandon his newly made friends, who ignite the inevitable final--and highly satisfying--confrontation.\n\nIs DEFIANCE a film filled with startling plot twists and dazzling production value?  No.  But I found it to be highly entertaining with real sincerity--and it continues to please me after repeated viewings.  All hands involved in this production deserve praise for working within their limited budget to craft a tough, tender and edgy action/drama where an average fella, who cannot ignore his heart, takes a huge risk to correct a great injustice.\n\nIs it SHANE?--Naw.  (But what is?)  I will tell you this: this flick delivers a whole fist-full of solid scenes.  Fer instance: the moment when Tom draws his &apos;line in the sand&apos;.  Waiting until cover of darkness, Tom strides out of the shadows, club in hand, and begins to demolish Angel&apos;s beloved &apos;low rider&apos; as an invitation to the gang--&quot;Come and get me.&quot;\n\nThat scene works on EVERY level: script, direction, photography, JMV&apos;s smoldering fury, the startling, hot musical score that punctuates the moment--IT ALL WORKS!  It gave me goose bumps the first time and it still gives me a kick to this day.  DEFIANCE had me in it&apos;s grip: &quot;Yeah, Tom! Screw the consequences!  Let&apos;s take it to these vicious punks.&quot;\n\nThis flick never had anywhere near the budget or status of say, a DIE HARD, but it sure has the heart.  In the early &apos;80s, as I lived in my tiny apartment in Hollywood and struggled to write, I kept a tattered DEFIANCE poster tacked to my wall for inspiration.\n\nDEFIANCE: a solid, commendable script, in the hands of a no-nonsense, focused director, who&apos;s leading a sincere and supportive cast--all in pursuit of a simple, but meaningful, action/morality tale that can&apos;t help but touch you on some level if you believe in justice and decency.  Not too shabby, folks.  Not too shabby at all.\n\nNow I just wish somebody would get DEFIANCE onto a proper DVD (and throw in a few extras like cast/crew interviews, a trailer, maybe even some out-takes).  I&apos;d buy a copy in a heartbeat.  And five more for some friends.",

      "reviewBody": "Five thousand years ago , in Ancient Akkad , Mathayus (Michael Copon) grows up as the proud son of Ashur (Peter Butler) , a captain in the world-renowned military corps of Black Scorpions, top-notch bodyguards, most of which are sent to courts wide away . By objecting to young Mathayus joining the corps , Ashur incurs the undying enmity of ruthless ruler Sargon (Randy Couture) , gets killed and the orphaned knave is shipped off to a desolate training camp for six years by king Hammurabi&apos;s clemency . Along the way Sargon annihilating all before them . What he has not banked on Mathayus is one of the last remaining members of the almos extinct Black Scorpion Warriors and he has a dab hand with a sword . When he returns as a Black Scorpion , Mathayus refuses , becoming a chased hero . Along with youth friends who help him somewhat unenthusiastically as a Greek called Ari (Simon Quarterman) , a beautiful warrior named Layla (Karen David) , an Orient swordsman (Tom Wu) and various mercenary warriors , they challenge the evil king , and battling the magnificent Bull of Minos , while embark on a daring quest to obtain Damocles&apos; legendary sword from Sargon&apos;s magical ally , the war-goddess Astarte (Nathalie Becker) who transforms herself and can forsee the outcome of battles . Mathayus uses all his strength and cunning to outwit a formidable opponent who will stop at nothing to unlock a supreme ancient power helped by a witch . New quest, new villains, one legend - the Scorpion King returns. See how the legend of The Scorpion King began! Warrior. Legend. Hero. King.\n\nBilled as a sequel to King Scorpion , it is really a prequel , this actioner is more in the ¨¨ Sword and Witchery¨ vein . Yes it&apos;s cheesy at times , but it doesn&apos;t actually strive for any more . In the wake of WWF fashion , the action here is relentless and unstoppable . In terms of milking a cash cow this prequel being actually inspired by the original ¨Scorpion King ¨ by Stephen Sommers that at the same time was a spin-off to ¨The Mummy¨ saga also directed by Sommers . But it&apos;s mindlessly amusing and entertainment all the same , and doesn&apos;t take itself seriously . All the men have the usual requisite amount , showing muscles and strength , while the women are all scantly clad . The only motivation behind the whole endeavour seems to be to make Michael Copon , a movie star , but it is failed . Average and unknown cast as Michael Copon who is the title star , accompanied by the resourceful Greek Pollux played Simon Quarterman and the gorgeous Karen David as Layla . While the hunk Randy Couture plays generalissimo Sargon who has bloodily seized the throne and demands cruel proof of blind loyalty . The picture was regular but professionally directed by Russell Mulcahy who keeeps matters rollicking , but it&apos;s wall to wall hokum nevertheless .\n\nThis thrilling Scorpion King saga is formed by the first and best¨Scorpion King¨ 2002 by Stephen Sommers with The Rock , Dwayne Johnson, Steven Brand , Kelli Hu , Grant Heslov , Bernard Hill , Michael Clarke Duncan .¨Scorpion King : rise of a warrior¨ 2008 by Russell Mulcahy with Michael Copon , Karen David , Tom Wu , Andreas Wisniewski , Randy Couture, Natalie Becker , Jeremy Crutchley . ¨The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption¨ 2012 by Raoul Reine with Victor Webster , Temuera Morrison , Ron Perlman , Billy Zane , Selina Lo . ¨The Scorpion King: The Lost Throne¨ (original title) 2015 by Mike Ellliot with Victor Webster , Ellen Hollman , Will Kemp , Barry Bostwick Barry Bostwick , Rutger Hauer, Michael Biehn, M. Emmet Walsh . ¨The Scorpion King: Book of Souls¨ (original title) 2019 by Don Michael Paul with Zach Mcgowan , Nathan Jones Peter Mensah , Mayling .",

Richard Widmark, (Mike Latimer) and Jane Greer gave an outstanding performance together, sometimes fighting like cats and dogs and struggling to get away from Trevor Howard, (Browne) who plays a very wicked character who will stop at nothing to get just what he desires in life. This entire cast of actors all gave an outstanding performance, but Widmark and Greer really put their heart and soul into this picture. Jane Greer experience a spinal injury during the making of this film, and years later she became very ill and needed surgery, which corrected her problem. It was during a scene in this picture where Jane goes through swampy water which contains many dangerous viruses.",

In fact, it revels in its origins and goes for the shock, gross-out and gore from frame one to frame last.  Gotta appreciate that; not all movies have that kind of conviction.\n\nBut in the end, it all is just kind of left there on the screen.

What I did appreciate, however, was the fact that a bunch of guys with cameras, little money and an idea got something filmed, produce and distributed.\n\nBless &apos;em.  And bless Troma, too.\n\nSix stars for the &quot;Dudes&quot;, plus a star extra for making it this far.  Way to go, blood!",

Very popular and successful vessels. All in all not a bad film , very entertaining if You haven&apos;t sailed on a tug although 5 stars for featuring one in a film. Good cast too.Scenes of Spanish ports and coastline are another plus. As are the scenes at sea both on board the Sea Fury, the interaction with the Dutch tug and even the sadly inaccurate salvage operation. Still, a fun show.",

Though he and Janet Leigh who worked together at MGM back in their salad days and they were good in this film together it never had the desired result for Van.\n\nWhen we meet them Van and Janet and their little girl Claire Wilcox were living in a small apartment where Van can&apos;t even find enough garbage cans in the place. He&apos;s a writer working on his masterpiece and Leigh is supporting the family as a dental hygienist. \n\nOne day their ship comes in and it arrives in the form of Martha Hyer, Van&apos;s literary agent. His book is a smash and with all the money they now have they move to Connecticut and more expensive digs. Hyer has all kinds of ambitions for Van both professional and personal. They include a Broadway play with a Hollywood film star Jeremy Slate.\n\nAs for Slate he&apos;s cut quite a swath in Hollywood bedrooms of the rich and famous and he sets his sights on Leigh when Leigh starts feeling neglected. To make it all even more incestuous Slate and Hyer were once involved.\n\nThe code was crumbling with this comedy about proposed infidelity. In a few years Johnson and Leigh would have done the deed with other partners.\n\nSome of the best lines come from new suburban neighbors Shelley Winters and Ray Walston. Ray is Shelley&apos;s house guest and Shelley has some sage advice being a member in good standing of the Hollywood first wives club.\n\nWives And Lovers got an Academy Award nomination for costume design and the literate wit of the script holds up well today. Do love all the trouble Johnson has with his new stereo set. How quaint that looks today.",

To see such a large crowd of beautiful, proud and peaceful African Americans celebrating our musical heritage was an event that I will cherish to my grave. I can only give thanks to everyone who participated in making this such a seminal event in my life. I was fortunate enough to be able to tape the movie when it came on cable TV but of course I am anxiously waiting for it to come out on DVD. You know the thing that really impresses me is that this came about as the aftermath of a very violent occurrence and there were, at least to my knowledge, no acts of violence during this event. What a great testament to us. Be proud black folks, be very, very proud."

This film is simply brilliant and finally provides us with an accurate portrayal of life amongst the hooligans in a way The Football Factory or ID never did.\n\nCentral to this are the amazing fight scenes and the performances of the primary actors with Hunnam in particular doing an outstanding job. And if anyone believed that all Elijah Wood movies would forever be tainted with the image of Frodo Baggins, think again. Within about 10 seconds of screen time, any lingering thoughts of LOTR are gone.\n\nYet whilst the direction, actors and the stunts will attract all the plaudits, for me, the main reason why this film works so well is the very clever story and the amazing script. Yes, in many respects the subject has been &apos;Americanised&apos; but it has been done in a way which is very subtle. I suspect that much of the credit for this goes to the writer Dougie Brimson because it is obvious very early on that there was a strong English influence on both the plot and the dialogue.\n\nGiven the level of violence, not to mention the subject matter, I&apos;m not that sure mainstream America will respond that well to it but for me, the big test will come when it&apos;s shown in England but I suspect like me, the English audiences are going to love it."

It was at Wal-Mart on DVD for $10, so why not?\n\nThe many disco scenes were refreshing to see, and seeing Rudy Ray Moore himself get down to the disco grooves was highly impressive.  However, this is not one of his best works!\n\nA large portion of this movie is just Rudy Ray saying how much he hates those who use PCP, and keep it on the streets.  He&apos;s going to get revenge by [messing] up some mother[messers]!\n\nPersonally, I like my Dolemite movies with a ton of cursing and lots of action scene, not a serious message.  However, the &quot;trip&quot; scenes, where people are freaking out because of the PCP, are well worth this.  Quite possibly some of the freakiest cinematography I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nI liked this movie mostly for the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes. Everything else is just filler, so you might as well watch the first fifteen minutes, go to any Drug Abuse information site and learn about PCP on your own, then come back and watch the last.\n\nOVERALL, I would give this movie a 8/10, because the good outweighs the bad. Must see if you are a fan of Mr. Rudy Ray Moore.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1976 the Argentine military overthrew the constitutional government and took power on the grounds that the country was descending into chaos. The regime targeted even moderate progressives and contemplated the assassination of all &quot;subversives&quot; with any capacity for leadership (including high school students demonstrating for reduced bus fares). There was systematic use of torture for obtaining information, and disappearance of victims, so relatives would never know their fate (the word &quot;desaparecido&quot;, disappeared, acquired a new and sinister meaning).\n\nIn 1977 a group of mothers with disappeared sons/daughters began to demonstrate in front of the presidential palace in Buenos Aires, and they became known as Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo (the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo). In spite of the regime&apos;s efforts (including death threats and violence) to suppress them, the Mothers pushed for information on the whereabouts of their children. Although they were initially ignored or ridiculed, their efforts eventually highlighted to the country and the world the human rights violations occurring in Argentina. European governments (to date strangely tolerant of the regime) had to take note and the US, that had supported the coup from its inception began to look discreetly for cover.\n\nLa Amiga (The Friend) begins in 1978. María and Pancho (Liv Ullmann and Federico Luppi) are a happily married couple living in a working-middle class suburb of Buenos Aires. Their eldest son is one of the disappeared. Maria&apos;s relentless search for her son makes her a target of the regime, especially when she joins the Mothers. Raquel, an actress, has been María&apos;s friend since early childhood. and she also becomes a target in a different way; she is Jewish, and her choice roles (such as Antigone) displease the dictatorship. \n\nThe movie ends in 1986. After the military regime imploded in 1983 democracy returned to Argentina, but the military intimated that any attempt to investigate their crimes would be answered with a new coup, which induced President Alfonsín to pass an infamous &quot;due obedience&quot; law that exonerated all but those at the very top. This was completed by President Menem with an general amnesty. The movie was released in 1988 and its last sequences reflect this; the menace of a new military coup is in everybody&apos;s mind, and puts a damper on efforts to clarify the fate of the disappeared. This is shown in a moving scene where María recognizes one of her son&apos;s abductors in a restaurant.\n\nNow, to the movie&apos;s specifics. Liv Ullman plays María, dubbed in Spanish. I am not a fan of dubbing, but in this case is of such quality that Ullman&apos;s face and body language combined with the voice of Argentinian actress Barbara Mujica merge into an outstanding performance. The rest of the cast (Argentines Federico Luppi, Cipe Lincovsky and Victor Laplace) is at the same level. Dialogs by Argentine writer Osvaldo Bayer are faithful to the local brand of Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires and environs. Director Jeanine Meerapfel (born in Argentina from German Jewish parents, refugees from Hitler&apos;s Germany) does an outstanding job overall.\n\nAlthough not germane to the movie, here is what happened in Argentina after 1988. President Kirchner, who took power in 2003 finally called the military&apos;s bluff, derogated amnesty laws and initiated mass trials of figures of the 1976-1983 regime. The military were cut down to size and publicly humiliated and some of the worst violators ended their lives in prison. Thanks to Kirchner, Argentines were finally rid of the military menace, one hopes for good.",

The latter is commonly thought to be shading his old partner Dean Martin, but I saw it more as Frank Sinatra, or a pastiche of the worst behavior of the Rat Pack, than Martin in particular. Regardless, it&apos;s an unpleasant character to watch, and while that&apos;s the whole point, it took away from my enjoyment a bit, even with the nice sentiment at the end.\n\nWith that said, Lewis is a funny guy, and it made me smile to see the nerdy professor bumbling around, sinking into the sofa at the dean&apos;s office, fumbling the pocket watch that blares out the Marines&apos; Hymn into a fish tank, and having his arms stretched out while lifting weights. Meanwhile Stella Stevens brightens up every scene she&apos;s in, and oozes sex appeal in the outfits the professor imagines her in during a happy little montage. She wears an elegant evening gown, a very short tennis skirt, a red dress with a high slit up the leg, and a bathing suit, all while giving him various come-hither looks that steam him up. The romances that have her somehow first attracted to Buddy Love and then later the professor don&apos;t make a lot of sense, but she brings a welcome bit of light into the film. Overall, worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just had to sit through Puffball at the Exeter Phoenix screening where Mr. Roeg graced us with his presence for a listed Q&amp; A session pre the movie viewingand thank god for &apos;his&apos; own sake he did. I thought Basic Instinct II was a turkey but this movie takes bird basting to a whole new level There&apos;s no doubting Nic&apos;s past pedigree (40 years ago) with über works such as Walkabout, Don&apos;t Look Now and that allegory of our current times The Man Who Fell to Earth but in his current contemporary offering the only truly menacing character in this supernatural themed movie is Molly&apos;s (Rita Tushingham&apos;s) Dog It does the menacing stare very well though as I know not of the book (original material)I cannot judge what Fay Weldon&apos;s original story had in mind? And interestingly, Mr. Roeg stated pre viewingthat this is a woman&apos;s film which as I saw the movie with three women all four of us didn&apos;t seem to share this heterogamy vision Major problems with the film are it&apos;s done on a shoe string budget and the characters particularly Liffey lack real depth and any sense of believable credibility And the monotonous steady delivery of the plot with no twists or unexpected turns also means that you just wish the whole experience would come to a more dramatic, less over acted, swifter end I kept expecting to have Father Dougal McGuire appear, with Mrs. Doyle in tow in which case some real farcical humour could have ensuedso at least the &apos;naff&apos; typical Irish stereotypes could be further exploited for better comic affect.\n\nI imagine as a favour to his buddy from the 1970&apos;s - Donald Sutherland&apos;s cameo appearances were there to add an A list weight -.playing the mad senior &apos;deity&apos; partner from Liffey&apos;s city slicker, architectural practice past. Poor old Donald wanders around grinning maniacally like a Cheshire cat mumbling words of architectural design guru wisdom, ruefully confessing to having always wanted to see an ancient fertility stone.\n\nThe continual references to Odin throughout the movie (Norse paganism) for me seemed at odds with the setting of in-depth Celt southern Ireland but lets not be a stickler for accuracy here perhaps it should have been shot in Stavanger? The heavy handed use of somewhat unsubtle sound xfx and inappropriate Irish music doesn&apos;t help either and I do suspect greatly with this work that younger members of the team have been overawed by the combined presence of Weldon (by proxy through her son, 2nd unit Director, and screenplay writer Dan) and Roeg into creating a low budget, 2 year film school result, instead of following their own more polished and well-honed intuitions. Miranda Richardson should really have known better And as a woman we do &apos;get&apos; how babies are made on a biological level seeing frequent cutaways to spermatozoa and uterine membrane walls if over done leaves you feeling somewhat violated To sum up, I&apos;d recommend seeing this movie for one reason only it&apos;s a testament to triumph of ego over more humble led creative sanity and you need a film like this every-now-and-then to appreciate what&apos;s really goodI saw 2 Days in Paris by the wonderful Julie Delpy last week this is definitely a &apos;womans&apos; movie also made on a low budget and is a remarkable result because of it And I whole heartedly recommend you all go see that!"

For a British audience, Moore (The Saint, The Persuaders) was the natural successor to Sean Connery.\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton makes this an expertly staged but somehow lacklustre affair. While the background voodoo theme is suitably bizarre, the main McGuffin about drugs smuggling is rather under-whelming for a Bond movie. Yaphet Kotto is a potentially strong baddie but has too little to do amid the familiar carnage and boat chases. And the introduction of the series&apos; first out-rightly comic character in Sheriff JW Pepper presaged the self-defeating lapse into self-spoofing the films would increasingly take.\n\nNor does a heavy-handed score by Beatles producer George Martin help. Unlike regular Bond composer John Barry&apos;s music, Martin&apos;s is ponderous, overlaid onto the action rather than organic to it.\n\nStill, Paul McCartney&apos;s blistering title-song really jolts Bond into the 70s. And Live and Let Die does have one of the best jokes in the entire series, in the opening sequence when a CIA agent, watching a New Orleans jazz funeral, innocently asks a nondescript fellow bystander: &quot;Who&apos;s funeral is it?&quot;",

But I must admit that now that I have seen it, this definitely was an enjoyable movie.\n\n&quot;My Best Friend is a Vampire&quot; is a light-hearted teen comedy with a vampire theme as its focal point, but still managing to put in elements such as transition to adulthood and all the problems that being a late teen comes with.\n\nThe storyline told in &quot;My Best Friend is a Vampire&quot;, as written by Tab Murphy, was actually a rather enjoyable and nicely paced story, not to mention an easily followed storyline and one that you quickly get immersed into.\n\nAnd with this being a 1987 movie, then you will see some familiar faces, provided you grew up watching movies and TV, of course. With the likes of David Warner, Cheryl Pollak and Rene Auberjonois. I will say that the definitely did have a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the various roles in this movie, and that the performers did good jobs.\n\nAll in all, then &quot;My Best Friend is a Vampire&quot; is an enjoyable teen comedy, and one that is as watchable today, as I bet it was back in 1987. This movie definitely haven&apos;t felt the passing of time. But such is it with vampires, I suppose.\n\nI am rating &quot;My Best Friend is a Vampire&quot; a six out of ten stars.",

To make a film of a work of this quality is especially challenging; changes and omissions are necessary if only to fit the usual length of a movie. The script by Aída Bortnik and the director Sergio Renán rises to the challenge (the action has been transposed from Montevideo to Buenos Aires, a minor point). Watch the film, then read the book (if possible in the original Spanish).\n\nWhat makes this movie memorable is the acting (Renan&apos;s direction of course has to do with this). Hector Alterio &quot;is&quot; Martin Santomé; after watching him you will find it difficult to imagine the character in any other way (Alterio went on to become a top actor both in Argentina and in Spain). The rest of the cast is equally excellent, especially Ana María Piccio as Laura Avellaneda. The veterans Lautaro Murúa and Norma Aleandro make the most of their small (but essential) parts. The music by Julián Plaza is just right. Very good cinematography by Juan Carlos Desanzo who later directed some celebrated Argentine movies, such as &quot;Eva Perón: The True Story&quot; (1996) and &quot;El Polaquito&quot; (2003).\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no Region 1 playable DVD of this movie (not to be confused with a 2003 Mexican version of the same novel). A shame.",

      "reviewBody": "It doesn&apos;t happy often, but I regretted this film&apos;s short running time. It only got good towards the ending! I guess they had to stick to children&apos;s movie length... Once again (as always in dutch movies) the voice-over is omnipresent. OK, it&apos;s kinda logical since the main character is a 10 year old boy who&apos;s trying to understand the world &apos;in words&apos; (since he wants to become a writer) But still... Throughout the movie dialogues are only fragments in his self-created world of thinking. This hinders the movie to get some human to human interaction going, like with old depressed grandpa and the boy. The voice-over didn&apos;t bother me in the more fantasy-like segments where our main character (who lives in an surreal, beautiful and empty The Hague) gets to meet the Queen. This movie almost converted me from a republican to a monarchist. Not because of Georgina Verbaan (who plays the busty queen in a bathing suit). No, it&apos;s the addictiveness of the child&apos;s fantasy, to believe in fairy tales again, thus to believe in stuff like kings and queens. Ah! (By the way, did I mention the queen lives in a very oriental, if not Islamic kind of palace, take that Wilders!) Anyway, the queen orders for the boy to write her a novel. After many failed attempts the boy desperately sighs: &apos;Couldn&apos;t I just turn it into a play!&apos; These kind of absurd jokes save the movie. There&apos;s some metaphors going on as well. The boy is trying to think of a &apos;first sentence&apos; (for the book). This will get slightly complicated (and kinda wacky) but in dutch &apos;first sentence&apos; is the same word for &apos;first desire/liking&apos;, so it might not be that weird that the boy figures out he will have to fall in love to get this book going! Just one example of the child logic meets modernism that are exactly the kinds of thing Toon Tellegen - a famous dutch writer - is known for, and guess what, this work is based on one of his books. And, of course, he makes a great cameo appearance.",

Brilliant and unconventional, with an amazingly whimsical style of narrated recalled episodes interwoven with introspective investigations and loads of imaginative tirades.

Great comic writing, lovely recurrent jokes, terrific voice talent and really excellent songs, especially the one about tasio bau (steamed pork buns). Excellent for the kids, heck, the whole family! Really smart stuff! And no, I&apos;m not biased just because my favorite female comedian Sandra Kwan-Yue Ng is one of the voice talents in this. ;)",

Having said this, the film is a good example of the way some lawyers truly do care about their clients and not intent on making a lot of money.\n\nI now know why Al Pacino is considered one of the greatest film stars in Hollywood. With roles in &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;Scent Of A Woman,&quot; &quot;Heat,&quot; &quot;Devil&apos;s Advocate&quot; and &quot;The Insider,&quot; Pacino has proven he is an actor with integrity and presence. The best thing about &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; was the true and genuine care that Pacino&apos;s character had for his clients.\n\nThe only thing I would change about this movie would be to narrow the story lines because it had a few too many to follow. With the number of subplots in this film, it was too difficult to pinpoint the main plot and enjoy the film outright.\n\nOverall, this movie was good and I recommend it."

Asks Janos.\n\n&apos;Yes.&apos; &apos;Will you stay with me all night?&apos; &apos;Yes. Every night, as long as I live&apos;, replies Luca.\n\nIt is almost the only words spoken between them and it was near the end of the film. Early on we see Janos&apos;s, dying, bedridden mother but we never see him with her and it is Luca, her daughter-in-law most of the time. Luca tells her that the doctor says she is well and will live to a hundred years. We are not sure but we are not too sure of anything. There are her flashbacks when she was beautiful and then she has some wonderful letters that Luca reads for her or she can sometimes through her magnifying glass but we realise his letters cannot be true because we gradually realise that Janos must be a political prisoner. It is a simple tale but such waiting, longing and tenderness and towards the end it is almost unbearably difficult and intense. The cinematography is brilliant and it is splendid throughout and the acting tremendous.",

      "reviewBody": "Susan and Alan Raymond spend 1 year at Stanton Elementary School in urban Philadelphia where 90 percent of the students are living way below the poverty line. Many of them come from single parent homes and some even have crack addicts as parents. Also, many of these kids suffer from behavioral and learning disabilities, many are given drugs such as Ritalin to help them cope. This documentary focuses on the kids and the Principal - Deanna Burney.\n\nThe principal comes up with very good solutions for problems that these kids face, including breakfast and lunch programs - where these are the only two meals some of kids get to eat in a day. Also the teachers talk to them about drugs, alcohol and and the things that they see everyday and how to best respond to them. They are lectured about how they are &apos;intelligent, talented, and gifted&apos; students and not to every doubt themselves.\n\nThere is one black male teacher who is assigned a class of all boys who need a positive male role model in their lives, he was remarkable. One kid said that all the white people in the neighborhood were mean because they came by and shot up some of the black people. This teacher goes on to explain to them on how not generalize and gives them some good examples. He also explains very well to us that these kids want to feel appreciated and loved before they can start the learning process.\n\nThere was one 8yr old girl who was having a hard time at school because both of her parents were crack addicts and decided herself that she would go live with her grandfather. This old man isn&apos;t her grandfather, he&apos;s barely a friend of the family. He explained how her moving-in was like how an alley cat finds itself a new home, it just appears and he took her in.\n\nThe principal is an exceptional human being who really cares for these kids. She puts in a lot of time and devotion (coming in 3hrs before school starts, working evenings). It&apos;s obviously hard for her when the school is very under-funded ($4000 per kid, where in the suburbs get 32,000 per kid).\n\nThis movie won the Oscar for &apos;best documentary feature&apos; in 1994 and it was well deserved. This ranks as one of the best documentaries I&apos;ve ever seen.",

      "reviewBody": "A 16-year-old singer/actress plays a girl who travels around a city seeking a mysterious white-haired man of power who can make all her dreams come true  where have we seen that since? Though it&apos;s a naturalistic (if not realistic) film instead of a fantasy, &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot; seems to me strikingly close to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (the legendary 1939 MGM version) not only in its plot structure but its overall approach. I can&apos;t help thinking that Judy Garland screened it and based her performance in &quot;Oz&quot; largely on Deanna Durbin&apos;s acting here, just as I suspect Victor Fleming studied Henry Koster&apos;s direction of this film to figure out ways to make &quot;Oz&quot; believable on screen. Aside from the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; parallels, &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot; is a first-rate film, a masterpiece within the limits of its genre, with a class consciousness we&apos;re more likely to see from Warners than Universal  one of its most moving aspects is the way the jokes and polite tossed-off remarks of the rich characters become heartbreaking when the poor characters take them all too seriously. Incidentally, apropos of some of the &quot;trivia&quot; entries on this film, the orchestra actually heard in the film was the Philadelphia Orchestra, recorded in the Philadelphia Academy of Music on a multi-channel sound system, the first time one was used in a film (contemporary reports differ on whether 12, 14 or 28 microphones were used); by then Leopold Stokowski was no longer the Philadelphia&apos;s main conductor but he was still the orchestra&apos;s principal guest conductor and he used them in other movie projects, including &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940).",

The antagonist from the 1984 original was returning and being played by the very same actor, it had so much potential to steer the franchise back on course.\n\nAlas it wasn&apos;t meant to be. Sadly Isaac returns into a mess of a film with a terrible cliched concept, an outstandingly dull pace and a film that contributes nothing to the series at all.\n\nCredit where credit is due it does have a great twist and the final scene is great, but then immediatly ruins it by having a poor finale to that.\n\nStarring the excellent Stacy Keach Isaac&apos;s Return should have been great but poor writing killed it stone dead.\n\nThe Good:\n\nDecent twist\n\nThe return of Isaac and same actor is great\n\nThe Bad:\n\nVery boring\n\nDisapointing ending\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nCalling a sixth movie 666 is tacky when it has nothing to do with the source material\n\nI thought &quot;He who walks behind the rows would be taller",

In contrast, the studio filming looks extremely flat and conventionally composed. It would be interesting to know who the second unit director was.\n\nIt is also of some interest to see Christopher Lee in an early role although, as usual, he is woefully underused.",

After a bad school dance with Fabian, she gets picked up by her singing idol Bobby Shore (Justin Chatwin) and his German friend Helmut. Fabian tells her that the chemicals may cause mutations.\n\nThis is a weird little Canadian indie musical. I like Jane Levy although she&apos;s not a top singing talent. Her singing is good show tune level. The old fashion crooning does get tiring which slows down the pacing. Filmmaker Jeffrey St. Jules seems to have quite a few ideas although they need to be sharpened into something with a bigger punch. I like the first half hour with its surreal touches but it descends into surreal dream chaos. It goes from cute weird to crazy melodramatic weird. It&apos;s not crazy enough to be outrageous but it is crazy enough to be non-traditional. It&apos;s weird and interesting. It&apos;s not cohesive enough as a story.",

      "reviewBody": "A good deal of the pre-Production Code Betty Boop cartoons are daring and creative, with content that makes one amazed at what&apos;s gotten away with. While the later Betty Boop cartoons made after the Code was enforced are still watchable and exceptionally well-made, they are so toned down that they feel bland.\n\nFleischer were responsible for some brilliant cartoons, some of them still among my favourites. Their visual style was often stunning and some of the most imaginative and ahead of its time in animation. The character of Betty Boop, one of their most famous and prolific characters, may not be for all tastes and sadly not as popular now, but her sex appeal was quite daring for the time and to me there is an adorable sensual charm about her.\n\nGood news is that she has not lost her charm, despite being significantly toned down, she is still cute and her comic timing is good.\n\nThe animation, as always, is extremely good, being beautifully drawn, crisply shaded and meticulous in detail. The music is infectious, lush and dynamic. There are some amusing moments, as well as some creative ones and the mix of live action (which also looks good) and animation works well. The voice work is solid.\n\nHowever, there is a vast preference for the Betty Boop cartoons that have a more surreal edge to the visuals and sharper and more risqué material. The story is also slight and the janitor character as well as being a less than tasteful caricature is not an amusing or particularly interesting foil for Betty.\n\nIn summary, watchable curiosity but there&apos;s better Betty Boop cartoons around (as well as worse). 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Indian Fighter&quot; was filmed entirely in the outdoor beauty of Oregon. The scenery and color are breathtaking. The action scenes are expertly staged and executed, particularly the Indian attack on the fort.\n\n Kirk Douglas stars in the title role as a scout who is hired to guide a wagon train through Indian Territory to Oregon. Walter Matthau (in an early role) and Lon Chaney (wasted again) play the villains of the piece who start up an Indian war by trying to steal gold from their land. Eduard Franz plays Red Cloud the Sioux chief who tries to keep the white man from encroaching on his people&apos;s land. \n\n Elsa Martinelli is an Indian maiden who becomes Douglas&apos; main love interest and Diana Douglas (Kirk&apos;s wife at the time and mother of MIchael) plays a settler woman with designs on Kirk but who has to settle for hard-working Alan Hale instead. I wonder how Diana Douglas felt about Kirk rolling around in a creek with Ms. Martinelli?\n\n Rounding out the cast are a number of familiar faces. Walter Abel plays the army captain, Elisha Cook a frontier photographer and Ray Teal, Frank Cady and Lane Chandler as various settlers.\n\n &quot;The Indian Fighter&quot; rises a step above similar westerns through its beautiful scenery and exciting action sequences. It is a truly exciting and colorful outdoor adventure.",

Ok, I won&apos;t slay the kids because there&apos;s no need to, but come on, they look lite they come from directly from the last episode of Joel-bitar or something. The acting isn&apos;t as horrible as it could be, but it&apos;s absolutely not good, except for one character, &quot;Biffen&quot;, played by Mats Wennberg. That&apos;s f-cking acting. Nope, I think this was one idea they could have put in the bin from the first day. It just doesn&apos;t work without the great acting of Gösta Ekman and the others.",

SF fans will enjoy early appearances by James Olson (&quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;) and Catherine Schell (&quot;Space 1999&quot;). Also Hammer alumnae Warren Mitchell as the chief villain, Adrienne Corri as a cop (loved her boots), Bernard Bresslaw as a heavy and, of course, Michael Ripper scarfing up distilled rocket fuel at the saloon. The special effects are not that bad. Great &apos;60s kitsch and fun if you don&apos;t take it seriously, &quot;Austin Powers&quot; fans may dig it.\n\nWhen you see Eddie Murphy&apos;s upcoming &quot;Pluto Nash&quot; you&apos;ll be surprised just how many ideas were taken from this film."

      "reviewBody": "The Brown Bunny, Vincent Gallo&apos;s latest travelogue of sorrow, charts the journey of the sort of disenchanted hero one comes across in the obituary page of their local paper. America, as seen through the window of Gallo&apos;s hollow black van, merges into a singular one-story wasteland of Main Streets lined with reds, whites and blues. Here, where many entertainment-seeking viewers will have long left the theater, one suddenly realizes that Gallo&apos;s is not a simple indie flick; but instead, a floating canvas able to tap into a higher meditative consciousness within the viewer. By creating a film of singular vision perhaps only attainable by doing what few directors have the tenacity or perseverance to undertake, Gallo has achieved what has eluded many an &apos;independent&apos; director: a film created almost solely by the director. Gallo&apos;s characters are ethereal spirits cast upon a harsh, unfriendly world. Chloë Sevigny, in yet another hypnotic role as Daisy, redefines the modern insistence on two-dimensional antagonists. For Bud, Gallo playing the sort of brooding innocent Marlon Brando once jarred audiences with, the American tapestry becomes a home movie of the banality of human existence. Cheryl Tiegs, the popular Seventies model, makes an unexpected cinematic comeback, delivering a beautifully poetic performance as a lonely woman in a nowhere rest stop. In a sterile, white motel room, Gallo&apos;s film culminates with a scene of erotic abandon. Yet here again, the Audience, as an extension of Bud&apos;s own painful emptiness, will find no release. The arid lovemaking of this star-crossed couple, in a room lit like an operating room before a lobotomy, appears so natural that at its&apos; heart could only be the sheer necessity of moral and emotional collapse seeking salvation. To see The Brown Bunny requires the sort of patience and reverence reserved for museums and galleries. For those few who choose, it can open the heart and the soul as only a masterpiece can."

This unfortunately results in some overly dramatic and/or hardly believable moments. Anyway it&apos;s true that in 90s after the fall of the communism was our country like wild west full of corrupt cops and whatnot. We may never truly know whether Kajinek really killed someone and it&apos;s important to say that this movie is just another European thriller, not a real life story. The quality of the movie is OK, given the fact that it was directed by a former stuntman. The cast is good and if you don&apos;t expect a Nolan style quality, you will be somewhat entertained. If you like it, I would recommend you another movie of this era - Sametovi vrazi.",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, this was very interesting and very well acted and all, nicely put together, and the ending was little twist that saved a lot.\n\nFew parts doesn&apos;t make any sense in the movie but that didn&apos;t bother me. It was lovely to watch the whole movie with huge interest for the ending.\n\nTruly worth of watch if you can handle thrillers and 80&apos;s style doesn&apos;t bother you.\n\nAnd for the last words, this was pretty original for a thriller.. legendary maybe. Now I got lost in nostalgic, enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.\n\nGorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the &apos;devil god&apos; that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).\n\nEmployed by Laura&apos;s agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island&apos;s natives, who offer her up to their god.\n\nFranco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain&apos;t enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",

      "reviewBody": "Following the Great War (aka World War I), three German soldiers vow to stick together through thick and thin. The &quot;Three Comrades&quot; are: temporarily disillusioned Robert Taylor (as Erich Lohkamp), cautiously optimistic Franchot Tone (as Otto Koster) and politically idealistic Robert Young (as Gottfried Lenz). They begin a soon-to-be struggling automobile repair business. The hesitatingly optimistic trio become a quartet upon meeting beautifully fatalistic Margaret Sullavan (as Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Hollmann). This is, of course, Germany between the two World Wars of the 20th century...\n\nThis allegorical film is too American for its own good, but the story holds up well. It benefits greatly by being from a 1936 novel by &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1929) author and young war veteran Erich Maria Remarque. The additional dialog by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edward E. Paramore Jr. is more astute than askew...\n\nThe intent is for Mr. Taylor&apos;s protagonist to carry the better qualities of the &quot;Three Comrades&quot; to a full representation of Germany. But, coming on like a cross between Greta Garbo and June Allyson, Ms. Sullavan takes the film away. And, considering the events of the 1940s, her character represented a bigger part of the whole. Sullavan was honored as &quot;Best Actress&quot; of 1938 by the &quot;New York Film Critics&quot; for her prescient performance. Her comrades contribute memorably and director Frank Borzage does exceptionally well with his &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; revenge and some great closing scenes.\n\n******** Three Comrades (6/2/38) Frank Borzage ~ Margaret Sullavan, Robert Taylor, Franchot Tone, Robert Young",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sensational Janine&quot; is one of the best porno movies I have seen.The film is narrated by Janine as she discusses her humble beginnings and her rise to become one of the top courtesans the world has ever seen.In her youth times she has oral sex with her brother and loses her virginity to the delivery boy.Her sexual awakening is insatiable and she becomes a nymphomaniac...First of all I&apos;m a rabid fan of horror/exploitation cinema.I prefer my porn mixed with horror.However &quot;Sensational Janine&quot; blew me away.The film contains lots of steamy sex scenes that are extremely titillating.They are explicit,but never become dull.Patricia Rhomberg in the lead is amazing.She is cute and charismatic and has a wonderful body.So if you are a fan of old-fashioned porn without ugly silicone enhanced porn starlets give it a look.9 out of 10.I had a great time watching this XXX classic.",

      "reviewBody": "A hit-man who is The Dude and Bad Santa both at once.\n\nPierce Brosnan is at his best and most hilarious in Richard Sherpherd&apos;s The Matador (2005), as a booze-drenched over the hill hit-man who loves bullfights, tacky clothes and teenage girls. It is his unapologetic lust for the latter that provide some great laughs in the film.. There is nothing funnier than hearing a sleazy, broken-down version of James Bond exclaim after ogling some Catholic schoolgirls, &quot;God I hate these Catholic countries; it&apos;s all blushy blushy, no suckie fuckie.&quot; \n\nSo Brosnan has a terrifically dirty mouth in The Matador and this is juxtaposed with Greg Kinnear&apos;s goody-goody family man character in their newfound, unlikely friendship. Both these characters elicit real sympathy, but especially Brosnan who should be a very unlikable character, a man desperate for a meaningful relationship in his life but just can&apos;t stop himself from saying the wrong things. We follow these two very different men as they learn from each other and start changing their lives, projecting equal doses of heart and humour.\n\nThe Matador effective in the sense that it mixes absurdity and quirkiness just right and glazes it with a dark comedy coating feel. It is also quite funny thanks to its Brosnan performance, but it does not have much in the way of a plot and no other characters or detours are even worth mentioning - so it is sadly very forgettable. Still, if you are even a slight fan of Brosnan&apos;s I urge you to see this film which is easily his greatest performance, and it&apos;s a crime he wasn&apos;t showered with awards for it. \n\n6.5/10",

Dortmunder (the author was inspired to this name by the German beer!) is not much like Donald Westlake&apos;s original in the Dortmunder books, along with some of the other characters. Redford is too handsome. George C. Scott in &quot;Bank Shot&quot; was much more Dortmunderish (Westlake&apos;s master-crook John Archibald Dortmunder is worn down and pessimistic), but in the &quot;Hot Rock&quot; movie Yates catches the &apos;Zeitgeist&apos;, or spirit of the times. And that&apos;s enough.\n\nBrilliant: Quincy Jones&apos; soundtrack (with Gerry Mulligan playing the sax).",

      "reviewBody": "When is saw Undisputed I thought it was OK , and the cast made it be interesting , although the plot was simple and boring until the fight. I didn&apos;t think a sequel would be made but here it is . \n\nFrom the beginning to the end this film is exciting and intriguing. The plot is solid and interesting and the cast is very well chosen. White does a very good acting as well as fighting scenes , while the other character (Boyka) assures the spectacular. \n\nNot your average fighting movie at all ! The scenes are remarkable and very close framed , the details are extraordinary and that is what makes the whole fighting look so good and realistic . Even the training for the fight looks technical and realistic. \n\nThe other stories ... Stevie&apos;s and Crot&apos;s (Nikolai) add the drama that makes this more than just a kick , punch , block movie . They&apos;re also good actors doing a splendid job and making this movie rate high. \n\nWhat else is there ... Oh ! Great soundtrack and ... almost forgot an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ending ! Watch this movie !",

Regardless of where the shark is in the ocean, how is it capable of knowing the moment a Brody sticks so much as a big toe into the water?\n\n3. If you attributed your husband&apos;s and son&apos;s deaths to a great white shark, wouldn&apos;t you want to go to someplace like Oklahoma instead of the Bahamas?\n\n4. Do all Bahamians slip in and out of their accents the way Mario Van Peebles does in Jaws: The Revenge?\n\n5. Could they have possibly made the shark look any more fake?\n\n6. Snails?\n\n7. You mean that piece of welded together scrap metal was supposed to represent all that is good about the Bahamas?\n\n8. Do sharks really jump out of the water like Shamu and roar like a lion?\n\n9. What&apos;s more frightening - a great white shark or Ellen Brody&apos;s hair?\n\n10. Is there a bigger acting whore on the planet than Michael Caine?\n\nThe best way to watch a movie like Jaws: The Revenge is with a group of friends. There&apos;s plenty here to make fun of.",

There&apos;s some decent thoughtful dialogue in this movie as well.",

      "reviewBody": "I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you&apos;ve seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we&apos;ve seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking. The young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar..even though I think movies like this are very hard to come by... If you&apos;ve seen &quot;I am Cuba&quot; , then this movie would appeal to you very much, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors, and a joy of creating art...and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together. I am not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate everything that&apos;s communist, but the film making in that part of the world, manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe.\n\nEnjoy it.",

Before watching, I read the comments, many people did not like this film, and there are a LOT of comments on this film that are not related to this film, and this film was on my watch list for a long time, but when I watched it, I realized that, probably, many of those who wrote that the film is bad, did not even watch it or watched it in a very bad translation.\n\nThe film is cool and exciting, but for some reason it did not find much popularity among the audience, I think due to the fact that it was released quite a long time ago, as if at the junction of eras, and therefore this film did not fall into the field of view of many viewers.\n\nAziris Noon&apos;s film is wonderful, striking with its locations and its cool special effects, exciting plot and humor, it impresses with its versatility and exciting dynamics, their story is impressive and inspiring, I really liked it.\n\nI watched this film with my family with great interest and pleasure. Children are delighted with this film. We really enjoyed this adventure. The film touches on deep and relevant topics, making the audience think about the meaning of life, time, values and choices. The film strikes a good balance between humor and seriousness, as well as between complexity and accessibility.\n\nThe actors play just fine, they get used to their roles perfectly and convey the personalities and moods of their characters. They play with such sincerity and enthusiasm that it is impossible to tear yourself away from the screen. I really enjoyed their adventures in Egypt, and it&apos;s interesting to see how the filmmakers imagined what the world of the future might look like, and the episode of the boys&apos; meeting with a representative of the people of Extraterrestrial civilizations is funny.\n\nThe film deserves attention and praise because it is touching, kind, and funny. The plot does not lose its relevance and attractiveness over time, which is suitable for viewers of any age and teaches friendship, curiosity and joy of life. I really liked Aina&apos;s phrase: &quot;don&apos;t forget who you really are.&quot; I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a high-quality and exciting film. The film evoked positive emotions. The plot is great, but the end of the film was somehow squeezed a lot. I wonder if there will be a remake?",

I sat through 7 Women from Hell because I thought her acting chops would be utilized, but it felt like a college production.\n\nPatricia and a group of women are captured in New Guinea at the start of WWII and sent to a Japanese prison camp. The guards aren&apos;t nice to them, the men are separated and sent to a different camp, the food is inedible, and there&apos;s an attempted rape that involves and intense physical struggle. It&apos;s a total copy of Three Came Home, even down to the &quot;She&apos;ll Be Coming Round the Mountain&quot; song that isn&apos;t nearly as effective in this movie as in the original. This version is really cheap, so you&apos;re better off sticking with the original. You don&apos;t believe for a minute Patricia or her friends are in a prison camp, from their endless attitude towards their captors that would undoubtedly earn them beatings or death in real life, to their salon-style hairdos that never get disheveled. And if you&apos;re waiting for Cesar Romero or John Kerr to show up, you&apos;re bound to be disappointed. John only has about five minutes of screen time, and Cesar doesn&apos;t show up until the last ten minutes.",

In reality, the restless Asian spirit is simply sought by the German lady simply to place her to rest.\n\n&quot;Dream Boy&quot; was a gay (male), Southern ghost story. &quot;Ghosted&quot; is a Euro-Chinese lesbian version.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Susana&quot; lacks the usual touches of irony and surrealism present in other Buñuel films. Buñuel tells a straightforward story - the sort of melodrama that dominated the Mexican movie theaters at the time.\n\nSusana escapes from the reformatory in which she was locked. It&apos;s a dark and stormy night. Meanwhile in a ranch nearby the members of a peaceful family follow their occupations. An old servant maid is mumbling that in nights like this the devil walks around. Thunder and lightning. Susana&apos;s face appears in the window. She faints. She is brought inside the house. Susana is a young girl with a wayward sensuality (remember, we are in 1951). Her presence will bring discord and threaten the stability of the family.\n\nBuñuel, even in his most surrealistic films, was always deeply anchored in the reality. That is why his films are so strong. His films have a taste of earth, humanity, sensuality. &quot;Susana&quot; is in fact a very sensual film. The camera subtly follows Susana, her chaotic sensuality, and the other characters&apos; reactions to her. She&apos;s the main character but not much is told about her. She was locked in a reformatory. Why? We are not told. The world doesn&apos;t accept her and her ways. Does she know what she really wants? Unfortunately it was not possible for Buñuel to give us a deeper portrait of Susana. We see her mostly through the eyes of the outside world. Why is Susana like that? What happened to Susana?\n\n&quot;Susana&quot; is an over-the-top melodrama - seemingly innocent, but in the &quot;happy ending&quot;, that seems to come out of a fairy tale, some people may detect a hidden laughter. The film was a big success in Mexico and contributed to establish definitely Buñuel as a commercially viable director.\n\nRosita Quintana as Susana proves her wide acting range (a shy governess in &quot;La Ausente&quot; and a sensual temptress in &quot;Susana&quot;). She&apos;s beautiful and in &quot;Susana&quot;, she&apos;s a real volcano. Fernando Soler also distinguishes himself as the pater familias (he was also the moralist judge in &quot;Sensualidad&quot; and the dissolute drinking father in &quot;Oveja Negra&quot;).\n\nActors and scenery are harmoniously integrated in &quot;Susana&quot; and Buñuel is (as always) a master of images and very adept in creating mood. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "If it weren&apos;t for MST3K, I wouldn&apos;t have seen or known of The Final Sacrifice in the first place. While it is not the worst of their movies featured(Manos, Monster A-Go Go, Wild World of Batwoman, Space Mutiny and Hobgoblins), it is one of MST3K best and most entertaining reviews/riffs. Make no mistake, The Final Sacrifice is a dire movie but because it made me amused at times, partly because the review and partly because of the absurdity of the characters&apos; names, I can&apos;t say that it had no redeeming qualities. Despite those patches of amusement, The Final Sacrifice is one of those movies that has more cons than it has pros. The camera work and editing are not quite as amateurish as Space Mutiny, but it is very slip-shod and continuity-ridden, never shrugging off the viewer&apos;s notions that it looks and feels like a first draft of a student film. The dialogue is awkward and laughably bad, I wouldn&apos;t be all that surprised if it was improvised often, while the story is ridiculous personified(like the cult knocking on Troy&apos;s door after he finds the map seven years after his dad was killed by the same cult) and due to the abruptness of the ending it feels unfinished also. The acting is terrible, with the fake voices it was very difficult to take them seriously, playing the characters for a laugh- as it seemed- didn&apos;t work as everything was far too amateur-hour-ish. The worst asset is the soundtrack, being badly recorded, annoyingly orchestrated, overpowering and hugely repetitive(it&apos;s literally only 3 pieces of music, all three of which sound as though they belong elsewhere). Overall, dire but I&apos;ve seen worse, on MST3K and generally. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "This is a collection of 6 animated Batman stories (in Anime style) aimed to fill the gap between Nolan&apos;s Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Each story is directed by different people but unlike Animatrix (WB&apos;s first animated filler compilation, done for the Matrix series), the look and feel of every episode is too similar to actually distinguish. The mood is more dark, violent and brooding than any other screen Batman interpretations. The first episode starts of relatively lightweight and is the most humorous. The stories then get edgier and darker. The whole compilation makes for an enjoyable viewing as Batman deals with the wild imagination of kids, spiritual healing, Hinduism!, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and a hit-man called Deadshot. But for me, the real joy of watching Gotham Knights is listening to the definitive Batman/Bruce Wayne voice that is Kevin Conroy, who has been the voice of Batman in every animated form from 1990 to 2006 (I think). Here, he is the voice of several variations of Batman and is pure joy to listen to. I have to admit though that a couple of Bruce Wayne animated interpretations don&apos;t really fit with his voice but Conroy&apos;s voice acting more than makes up for it. The animation is great but not anywhere near as radical as Animatrix or recent Anime films. The action scenes are quite thrilling. Also, very worthy of mention is the exhilarating soundtrack, particularly in the Scarecrow episode. All in all, this is a great addition to the Batman animated collections.",

Bear that in mind and much makes sense - more sense than the poem ever did to me when I first tried to read it. Much that purports to be science is just poetry. The film-makers have made some attempt to update the plot and the setting, bearing in mind that we have all seen 2001: a Space Odyssey..\n\nThe science is still cheesy. The ship has lost all its fuel, but power is uninterrupted and water is abundant (there is not only an extended lesbian shower scene, but a 20m swimming pool!). The architecture of the ship is absurdly angular, but nothing ever springs a leak. The ship&apos;s interior has been compared to a shopping mall and a cruise ship, but manufactured goods never show any sign of running out, and the whole thing seems absurdly understaffed.\n\nIt&apos;s basically an exploration of how an isolated group of people copes when it is cut off from Earth, its memories and hope. The main characters are sufficiently well drawn to explore these themes in, for me, a satisfying way. On those terms, it does well and is worth watching, though you must fill the hints in the chapter headings with your own deductions.",

This also led to the famous election of the far-right Thatcher government at the same time, but, they had not been in office for long enough to affect the approach of the film.\n\nI saw the film at the time it was first shown, and being a punk and having a father that was a trade union leader at the time, much of what was portrayed in the film was familiar to me.\n\nAlthough the film was very much trying to be a &apos;grim Northern realism&apos; film for the 80s (and set in the south at that!), it was pure fantasy - things were never that bad, and it&apos;s easy to get depressed about situations that are portrayed as every-day occurrences that either never happened or were rare. The scenes of race riots are particularly overstated.\n\nThe music of the film, however, is it&apos;s strongest area. It is absolutely of its time, and completely representative. It is so classic that &quot;In the beginning...&quot; was being played in a country pub that I was in only last week (9/99) nearly 20 years later. What followed was &apos;New Wave&apos; with &apos;Duran Duran&apos; and others - what a disaster!\n\nGiven the slow degradation of the main character over the duration of the film, it is interesting to see what happened the the actress who played her (Hazel O&apos;Connor) in real life. Life imitating art?"

The fact that it took so incredibly long for the then higher powers to admit to the existence of AIDS is stunning and sad. The performances throughout the movie were moving and effective. I thought that Sir Ian McKellan and Richard Gere represented respectfully the signs of strength and fear.\n\nI was also disheartened to learn that throughout this tragedy, there were individuals who might have been more concerned with helping and protecting their own reputation and agenda as well as accepting the credit for their work in breaking down point by point the disease known as AIDS. Alan Alda as Dr. Gallo was fascinating. In fact all of the performances from Matthew Modine and Richard Gere to Steve Martin and BD Wong were great. The most important thing here though is the history of this disease and the hope that we can learn from it.",

      "reviewBody": "Red Lights is a strange, abstract, almost existential exercise in movie making. Adapted from the 1953 novel by Georges Simenon and set to Debussy&apos;s elegantly creepy Nuages, writer-director Cedric Kahn offers up movie with attributes of a Hitchcockian suspense thriller.\n\nThe feeling of foreboding begins immediately when we meet Antoine Dunant (Jean-Pierre Darroussin a low-level insurance executive. He&apos;s just leaving his job to meet his beautiful wife Hélène (Carole Bouquet) in a local café. They are planning to drive to the countryside from Paris to pick up their kids from summer camp.\n\nBut as soon as Antoine gets to the café he guzzles three beers back to back with one eye on the street lest his wife arrive before he&apos;s suitably fortified. It soon becomes pretty obvious that their marriage is far from happy - Antoine armed with enough drink to sink an elephant, settles into a manner of truculent impetuosity, while Helene remains detached, cold, and almost abusive.\n\nWhile in the road, Helen discovers that her husband is utterly plastered. She hardly says anything as he weaves all over the road, but her silence speaks volumes. Thus starts a trip of barely controlled hostility with the husband clenching the wheel and brooding, while the wife fumes beside him. Both are so busy bickering with each other and thinking dark thoughts that they&apos;re half oblivious to news reports of an escaped convict on the loose nearby.\n\nAntoine isn&apos;t usually a drinker, but something has snapped in him, and as the neon signs of the roadside bars start to beckon him, he becomes obsessed with downing as much cold beer and whisky as he can. He leaves Helene angrily waiting in the car while he goes into yet another bar, to prepare himself for the long night ahead.\n\nHélène, freaked by his increasing belligerence and inability to drive in a straight line, abandons her husband to look for a train station. Meanwhile Antoine strikes up a conversation with a reserved one-armed stranger (Vincent Deniard).\n\nWhen, minutes later, the stranger steps out of the parking-lot shadows, his face half hidden by the hood of a sweatshirt, and asks for a ride, the cocky, staggering Antoine doesn&apos;t even break stride. By now he&apos;s so sweaty and drunk that he waves the fellow right into the car.\n\nWhat follows is detour into a night of terror for Antoine, Helene, and for the viewer. The movie starts to resemble everyone&apos;s nightmare - the inexplicable disappearance of a loved one. And as Antoine embarks on a desperate journey to track his wife down, it soon becomes clear that Red Lights is really showing us a portrait of a marriage, a marriage that has been enigmatically hanging by a thread.\n\nTheir need to see the children again is probably just a way of distracting them from the aridness of their relationship. She&apos;s beautiful and accomplished, while he plain and dull. Somehow the couple began their marriage as equals, but she soon eclipsed him, for which he can&apos;t forgive her. Other than this, Kahn provides very little reason as to why their relationship has suddenly gone sour.\n\nWhat Kahn does provide, however, is the knowledge that marriage can often dissipate completely, leave two strangers in a car, totally sick of each other, in desperate need of a reviving shock to the system. But when the sun finally rises, and Antoine is released from his drunken hell, Kahn does provide a dash of hope for the couple.\n\nIn the end, Red Lights is showing that relationships are frail and that the machinations of marriage are often inexplicable. And if nothing else, Antoine and Helen show that it can all dramatically and irrevocably change and fall apart in a searing flash of red light. Mike Leonard September 05.",

It&apos;s a story every young person who likes military fighter jets would love to live.  It draws on the fact that you wish it was you &quot;going in to knock the s... out of them..&quot; (As Chappy put it).  You people who rip on the realistic plot.....hey.....go watch a documentary.  Or go glam like Hollywood and watch Top Gun. How many times have US and Russian planes flown inverted and given the other the bird from a few feet away.

      "reviewBody": "I went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument.  The film is now best known from the suite of music Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the Troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements.  The general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings.  A clerk accidentally generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar.  The tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn&apos;t exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.\n\nI had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but I&apos;d heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens.  Then the film turned up at the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival.  For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe.  As the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there&apos;s no time to correct the mistake.\n\nHaving gone expecting an historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously.  Although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few &quot;trick&quot; shots where multiple images appear on the screen.  For instance, the tsar&apos;s army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen.  Four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison.  Two identical servants scrub the floor.\n\nOne slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. There were two women who might have been the tsar&apos;s daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else.  And very few people were named.  But all in all, an enjoyable film and I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s not seen more often.",

      "reviewBody": "Steven (Adrien Brody), nearly 30 and living with his parents, sees an old Edgar Bergen movie on TV and decides to fulfill his longtime dream of becoming a ventriloquist. His beautiful unemployment counselor Lorena (Vera Farmiga) finds him work, but puts out a restraining order on him when he paints a thank-you note on her door. Later, this young mother agrees to date him anyway, but finds his bickering family, and his inexperience with women, daunting to a relationship. Steven&apos;s sister Heidi (Illeana Douglas) is a wedding planner with a drunken ex-fiancé who keeps showing up at the door. His friend Fangora (Milla Jovavich) is a pseudo-punk rocker whose sex does not prevent her from giving him terrible advice about women. The wedding of a Jewish girl, who wants Klezmer music and gets something unexpected, will become a turning point in everyone&apos;s lives.\n\nWhoa, this is bad. Greg Pritikin directs his own script, about a tenth of which is funny. The rest strains hard to give us quirky characters, wacky situations and unexpected plot twists; but we can&apos;t buy any of it. The movie becomes unrecoverable when Lorena changes her mind about the restraining order and agrees to date Steven—after he mails her a videotaped apology featuring himself and his dummy. The message on her door disturbed her, but the tape charmed her? I could almost hear Vera Farmiga&apos;s brain going &quot;ZZZZZT!&quot; as she tried to play this character. Their relationship grows into the least believable nerd-with-beautiful-girl scenario I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nThe performances are varied. Adrien Brody recovers fairly well from playing such a pointless character. Farmiga is charming, especially considering the impossibility of her job. Jovavich, with her affected Jersey accent, never quite seems to inhabit her character. Illeana Douglas, a good actress, does a lousy job here. She doesn&apos;t seem to get what she&apos;s doing, and we can hardly blame her.\n\nThis is part of a sub-genre in comedy that I dislike: one that blurs the distinction between celebrating and belittling the losers it depicts. &quot;Napoleon Dynamite,&quot; &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; and documentaries like &quot;American Movie&quot; and &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; all belong in this dubious category. But &quot;Dummy&quot; is much worse. It&apos;s as phony as it is condescending."

I would suppose that the people who hate this film would also not understand or enjoy vaudeville or other, absurd comedy like Laurel &amp; Hardy, The Three Stooges, Jerry Lewis &amp; Dean Martin, etc. Monty Python? Doubtful. It seems that contemporary comedy has to be slick and profane and people have simply forgotten how to laugh at people being purposely silly. Although they were a bit political and off-color, I think the Not Ready For Primetime Players (remember them? They were the group generally considered wildly talented who started Saturday Night Live)were all pretty silly - and hilarious. DO NOT ignore this film on the not-at-all-objective reviews given here.",

The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie.  It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids.  Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren&apos;t all that intimidating...they&apos;re actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don&apos;t judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.\n\nThere isn&apos;t a character in this movie I didn&apos;t fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli&apos;s, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his &quot;booty traps...that&apos;s what I said, booby traps&quot; galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth.  Those are only a few...there are many more.  A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle).  I&apos;ve seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.\n\n This is absolutely a pure, fun-filled movie to enjoy with your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, or simply by yourself.  Hang on and enjoy the ride!  The Goonies earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",

One is ladies in lingerie or revealing gowns. (Dunne wears neither but at one point we see her in her boss&apos;s bathrobe.) The other is gentlemen who appear to prefer other gentlemen.\n\nOne of these is its director and star, Lowell Sherman. He had a solid hand as a director and is likable as a performer. But he&apos;s a little hard to buy as a ladies&apos; man. And in one scene, he goes to a friend&apos;s apartment, demanding to see who&apos;s in the bedroom. Instead of the woman he&apos;s looking for, two men are there. They&apos;re fully clothed and maybe the audience at the time thought they were sleeping off hangovers. Maybe that&apos;s what the script meant, for all I know. But it&apos;s not the way they come across in the context of the movie.\n\nThe print I saw was fuzzy but it&apos;s chic and entertaining -- dated but also risqué.",

Perhaps it is the german way how this rather serious case has been treated: very heavy-handed.\n\nCompare this film to just two films of Fassbinder (Deutschland im Herbst or Die dritte Generation) which are, though not re-enactments but nevertheless so much more accurately captivating a sense of history.\n\nToday this film just appears as if the director didn&apos;t come up with any visual idea, therefore deciding to stage a play and film this instead. Unfortunately, even as a play, this thing would have been very boring.",

I had wanted to see it since I was a kid having read about it in SHRIEK! a short lived British horror movie mag.\n\nso, 35 years later I finally get to see it and I was not disappointed. It&apos;s not a great film, but it certainly shines above many of the horror films that were churned out during the same era (a la Blood of the Vampire 1958). The atmosphere and mood of the film is just right. \n\nThe only truly annoying thing about the film to me was the beatnik-style music.\n\nYes, it is a Hammer knockoff, but it was one of the better ones. (Even the later Hammer films were &quot;Hammer knockoffs.&quot;)\n\nI say give it a chance! If you don&apos;t you will not know what you are missing.",

      "reviewBody": "An evocative meditation on history, Boxhagener Platz moves at an effecting pace through a Brechtian degree of character study towards the resolution of the &apos;who-dunnit&apos; that drives the plot forward.\n\nAs a film, several elements come together to manifest the film&apos;s focus which is preoccupied with the nature of History. The high standards of recreation of 1960s inner city East Berlin with an exemplary attention to detail contrasts with the constant call and recall the characters make to the recent Nazi past and it&apos;s ghostly spirit uncannily pervades the very air these people breath. The conflict and all defining issue of Ideology which defined the fate of the German people living in those decades is brought into high profile. The mostly wordless observations of the child protagonist acts to show the confusion of messages and cognitive processes required to adapt to that time and place. \n\nThe film&apos;s self absorption does indeed make this a particularly German &apos;Heimat&apos; film but the film is clear in it&apos;s indication of the complex social condition which demands such attention.\n\nDespite being an adaptation of a novel, the film is very evocative of Brechtian theatre in the pacing of itself primarily through intense character study. This aspect acts as the bind which synthesises the real and ghostly echoes of the Communist and Nazi reality whose spirited co- existence defines how the film presents History as it&apos;s main subject.",

By the time you are at the end of the film and the lights turn back on, you find yourself a bit stoned by the amount of emotions you have experienced. You then wish the film had taken even longer in presenting its different characters, or perhaps you wish you had paid better attention. \n\nYou want to hate the film because it displays such a level of horror; the hellish reality of the Rwandan genocide is clear in this film.

Those people in that house?&quot; to character Frank Chambers. And Ken Edwards does do a good job as Frank Chambers, taking charge of a situation we think we know all too well: the zombiegeddon.\n\nNo great special effects, but some nice thought-out strategy, if such an unlikely event were to ever occur. Seems the filmmakers didn&apos;t really have the money to pull off the battle scenes they needed, but the general atmosphere and mood is great. A bit more blood would&apos;ve helped things along nicely.\n\n(A slight critique - if you&apos;re going to have a &quot;personal video diary&quot; throughout the film, why not make it shakycam so it doesn&apos;t seem the same quality as everything else?)",

      "reviewBody": "When you want brutal, look no further, but when you also want to see perhaps the greatest of all comic-book movies not based on a comic-book, it&apos;s in George Romero&apos;s original take on his continuing mythology. It&apos;s not just one of the towering horror films, or horror comedies (what will a poor dead fellow do when the escalator starts?!) but one of the great sequels, more ambitious and ass-kicking than its predecessor, with a filmmaker more confident and technically proficient with his abilities.\n\nRomero didn&apos;t originally want to do *any* sequel to his original &apos;Night&apos;, but after a visit by some friends to a soon-to-open mall nearby his hometown of Pittsburgh, it struck a chord as to who would be coming here – and what so much consumerism in one place would mean. &quot;Why do they come here?&quot; one of the four survivors that happens upon this mall swarming with these flesh-eaters asks another. &quot;This meant something to them. Instinct, maybe. This was an important part of their lives,&quot; he responds.\n\nI don&apos;t think necessarily Romero meant to show the film as any sort of &apos;This is what will happen!&quot; type of social horror thing. It&apos;s more about, this is where we are at NOW, and in that sense, though broader and a whole LOT bloodier, it holds a place right next to a film like Network as one of the magnificent satires of its time and place, and as much about what the public is like. Romero acts as both pessimist and optimist in this world though; past all the chopped limbs, exploding heads (oh yeah!), Tom Savini stunt and make-up and intestines ripped apart, what holds up the film for me is seeing these four characters come to grip with the horror they&apos;ve made for themselves, holding up in this &quot;paradise&quot; of a mall.\n\nBalls-to-the-wall horror, social horror, and some genuine paranoid horror stuff (note to self, never try and fire a gun at a single zombie when in a dark room full of electrical wiring and pipes), and plenty of rock and roll attitude, this is a personal favorite and the most entertaining horror film of its time. And the Goblin music soundtrack yummy.",

Maybe here: Soldiers who don&apos;t at all act &amp; move like trained soldiers, female soldiers with make-up on while in combat, some third rate CGI effects that I could do on my PC in fifteen minutes, and enough plot-holes and unexplained crap to lose count of fairly fast.\n\nIn fairness, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Bill Mosely made the film ALMOST watchable. But those two alone couldn&apos;t save the horrid storyline, and the above-mentioned things. I tried very hard to get past some of the issues that I found with this film, but it was to no avail. After 48 minutes I found myself being thankful that I was more than half way into the film.\n\nI thought years ago (in the 80&apos;s) that low-end horror flicks couldn&apos;t get any more lame, but was DEAD WRONG. It is sad to see someone as talented as the Oscar winning Cuba Gooding taking roles in such ridiculous movies. I hope that his appearance in this one didn&apos;t ruin his career long-term.\n\n-JB",

      "reviewBody": "I am a regular Hollywood movie buff, and heavily rely on IMDb user ratings, before watching any movie than relying on any other sources, and I prefer to watch movies which are usually rated at least 7 out of 10.\n\nSo when I had a chance to see the movie First Knight, I was in a doubt whether to watch this movie with a low rating of 5.6/10, even with great actors like Sean Connery and Richard Gere, or to skip to some other movie.\n\nLuckily I decided to give it a shot, and oh what a movie it was. I really love the medieval age and other historic movies, and this is a gem added to the list. As reading some other reviews revealed earlier, that this is an adaptation of Arthurian legend, and not a true story, so I didn&apos;t bothered about the facts in the movie.\n\nIt scores really high in terms of acting, fight sequences, chemistry between actors, and especially keeps you engrossed throughout the movie. As a &quot;movie&quot;, the story works well and has all the elements balanced.\n\nIf you are a fan of historic movies, please don&apos;t trust the IMDb ratings for this movie. Just sit and watch this movie on a nice evening, and you won&apos;t repent it.",

Thing is, it very quickly turns into a nightmare. I can imagine most Gamers would enjoy the movie, even if it were only for the possibilities....\n\nThe movie follows a group of elite Gamers who are called up to try out a new virtual reality experience. When things quickly take a sinister turn, are the best-of-the-best good enough to finish the game?\n\nI enjoyed The Call Up as I quickly became engaged with the characters. The acting was solid and the special effects were spot on. It takes you to the next level of game-play and makes you think about what we actually do in games when we&apos;re blowing each others heads off. There is a kind of predictability of sorts, but that would be nigh on impossible for this not to be the case and it&apos;s not as if the entire story is wide open.\n\nThe ending was a bit of an anticlimax, but in actual fact, this probably is a good thing given the mood of the movie.\n\nI did enjoy the movie and would recommend it to any Gamers or avid movie watchers. It&apos;s never going to be a blockbuster or total crowd pleaser, but I didn&apos;t feel I&apos;d wasted time by watching it (how I judge most movies) and I wouldn&apos;t be averse to watching it again. If you don&apos;t find the prospect of virtual reality intriguing or feel like gaming is for kids, then probably best to give this one a wide berth.",

      "reviewBody": "I am never sure which Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s is. I can certainly think of movies which more accurately portray the human condition, but of few that are more fun.\n\nNeither Holly nor Paul seem to represent real people. Their attraction, which is the focal point of the movie, is a character unto itself. Paul sees Holly as scared, vulnerable, and in need of rescue and enjoys his role as potential knight in shining armor to her damsel in distress. She is drawn to him because he sees beyond her facade of fabulousness to the scared little girl she is inside and which she tries (not that hard really at all) to hide. Adding to her attraction to him is the fact that he stands up to her when she treats him shoddily. This probably does not happen to her too often, and it intrigues her. \n\nThese are mostly the tricks a romance novelist uses to keep readers baited and rooting for a fictional, possibly doomed romance to work and do not reflect the real nature of love. There is, however, enough chemistry, genuine affection, and respect between the two characters to keep the story from seeming utterly implausible.\n\nOf course, a movie doesn&apos;t have to be realistic to realistically portray what is right and what is wrong with the world we live in. Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s doesn&apos;t do a whole lot of that either, though. After watching I can never pinpoint one solid message from it. \n\nWhat it does have a lot of, as many others have pointed out, is stylish, witty, good fun. This is almost always the movie I choose on the rare occasions when my husband is working late, my son is asleep, I have energy to spare and good bottle of wine just begging to be uncorked. Believable or not, it is well-told and compelling, and remains one of the better movies a gal can lose herself in.",

The story is totally silly and because the main star is about 5 feet tall, it&apos;s simply impossible to be impressed by any of the over-compensating machismo going on. The night racing scene, with the ugly woman in cut-offs, is priceless. Watching everyone act ghetto during what was supposed to be the film&apos;s highlight was truly embarrassing. The strip club scene was hot &amp; compelling thanks to those quick edits which told us that it was supposed to be hot &amp; compelling because the lack of acting abilities from its main star wasn&apos;t helping the director. The characters were all one dimensional and uninteresting. Only the cinematography was OK.\n\nSeriously, this film is to be avoided at all cost.",

      "reviewBody": "A teen Jewish girl and her family are imprisoned in a concentration camp . There, the 14-years-old girl played by Susan Strasberg finds a harsh reality and changes identities with the help of the camp medic and rises to the position of Kapo. This is a good movie about the brutal existence at concentration camps and subsequent breakout from horrible place. This excellent movie deals about extermination center, abuse of camp guards or Kapos who enjoy their power, prisoners committing suicide and the subsequent getaway led by Laurent Terzieff and Russian prisoners . We see the horrors,murders,massacres against the prisoners and Nazis personify evil . Thus , when the incoming transports ,mostly Jews, SS soldiers made instant decisions,those who were fit to labors were sent into the camp, others including the children ,were dispatched immediately to the gas chambers.Finally the inmates broke out in a desperate riot that I believe it can be the concentration camp of Sorbibor, only in which Russian prisoners achieved to escape . The picture reflects perfectly the atrocities as a by-product of sheer Nazi evil . The flick is powered by splendid performances , as Susan Strasberg, -daughter of Lee Strasberg, creator of Actors studio- as suffering starring and Laurent Terzieff is watchable as obstinate Russian soldier wishing freedom. Appears as secondary actor playing a Nazi soldier Gianni Garco or John Garco, future Spaghetti Western hero named Sartana . Shot in magnificent black and white by Sekulovic and Carlo De Palma , Woody Allen&apos;s usual cameraman . Sensitive and atmospheric score by Carlo Rustichelli. The film achieved an Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign movie but lost to the ¨Virgin Spring ¨. This extraordinary and unknown film by one of the pioneers of political film , he always interesting director Gillo Pontecorvo. It was one of the first films about the theme of Jewish holocaust and one of the more realistic in its recreation . Gillo subsequently will directed ¨Battle of Argel¨ and ¨Queimada¨.\n\nThe picture is based on real events and survivor&apos;s memories,these are the following : The large death camps were transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference (1942). There was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates (as happen with the starring&apos;s family) . Victims (as Susan Strasberg and her parents) were brought to the camp in unventilated transports, and all but a handful were gassed after arrival,the gas chambers could accommodate hundred prisoners at one time using Zyclon B which was a crystallized prussic acid which dropped into death chamber ,most of their corpses were burned in open pits (as occurs at the ending of the movie when is opened a large hole to bury unfortunates).",

      "reviewBody": "Hellphone is the story of a boy who , not really knowing it , buy an evil phone who has a mind of its own to get the girl of his dream. It&apos;s a crazy film from beginning to the end , it goes at a crazy speed both in the writing and the direction, the camera keep zooming in,zooming out,the color are bright and the actor all have very high energy. There&apos;s a lot of dark comedy in there too (There&apos;s a scene were a fast food owner deep fried his own head)and plenty of laugh. Jean Baptiste Maunier had become very popular in France since &quot;les choriste&quot; and even if I must say that I don&apos;t consider myself a fan of him , I really did find him convincing in the role of a metal-head kid. But in my opinion the real star of the film is Vladimir Consigny who plays Virgile , the self obsessed bad guy in the story,he bring a lot of fun to the role ( and I&apos;m not talking about the strip tease scene ) he&apos;s just a really different sort of villain. The last 15 minutes of the film are the best for both fans of horror and comedy. It&apos;s a really hard film to describe but if any of you saw film like &quot;Idyle hands&quot; or &quot;Shawn of the dead&quot; I am sure you will have a fun time watching this silly horror/comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Roses Bloom on the Meadow-Grave&apos; belongs in the subgroup of movies known as &apos;Heimatfilm&apos;, a film genre unique to the German-speaking world. &apos;Heimat&apos; is the German word for &apos;country&apos; or &apos;homeland&apos;. Heimatfilmen take place largely outdoors, emphasising the countryside of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is usually a young heroine who somehow embodies the spirit of the land. Nature is celebrated, specifically Germanic nature. But the typical Heimatfilm is celebratory in nature, and celebratory *of* nature. &apos;Meadow-Grave&apos; is extremely unusual, in that it&apos;s a dark, morbid Heimatfilm with a Gothic atmosphere.\n\nDorothee is a peasant girl, daughter of farmers Wilhelm and Friederike. They can barely stake out a living on their small tract in the Lüneburg Moor. Her parents arrange Dorothee&apos;s betrothal to Dietrich Eschmann, a wealthy old lecher. But Dorothee is in love with her childhood companion Ludwig, who has now become a successful architect in the big city. Eventually, Eschmann threatens her. Dorothee lures him out to a lonely spot on the moors. In order to save herself from Eschmann&apos;s clutches, Dorothee may have to die on the moors. Has she any hope of happiness?\n\nThis film is pervaded by a strong sense of Germanic doom, of destiny being more powerful than human desires. None of this is unusual for German subject matter, but it&apos;s very unusual indeed within the Heimatfilm structure. This movie&apos;s photography is stark, moody and distinctive. Most of the leading actors give excellent performances, and the ending is impressive. I&apos;ll rate this movie 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "In Los Angeles, the eleven year old Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) seeks the successful lawyer Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) trying to hire him to earn medical emancipation from her mother Sara (Cameron Diaz) that wants Anna to donate her kidney to her sister. She tells the lawyer the story of her family after the discovery that her older sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) has had leukemia; how she was conceived by in vitro fertilization to become a donor; and the medical procedures she has been submitted since she was five years old to donate to her sister. Campbell accepts to work pro bono and the obsessed Sara decides to go to court to force Anna to help her sister.\n\n&quot;My Sister&apos;s Keeper&quot; has a potential story with a promising beginning. However, the screenplay entwines flashback of situations of Kate&apos;s cancer sometimes in a confused way and has a melodramatic conclusion that could be shorter. The greatest problem is the shallow and unrealistic Hollywoodian approach, reducing the strength of the powerful drama, and I believe that this theme would be better explored by an independent director in a more realistic environment. The teenager Sofia Vassilieva has an awesome performance and Cameron Diaz is also great in the role of a mother that becomes obsessed to save her daughter and forgets her family. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Uma Prova de Amor&quot; (&quot;A Proof of Love&quot;)",

It is good to have several story lines that work well to come together for a good wholesome story.\n\nThe characters in the movie were good and believable, though some of the dialogue were cheezy at times.\n\nThe effects of the movie were adequate, but of course you can see it is not a multi-million dollar Hollywood CGI fest going on. But with that in mind, they made the effects work well enough.\n\nThis movie is a good alternative to the usual comedies and horrors movie that mostly come out of Korea. It also takes up some real life issues about tsunamies.\n\nIn overall I think this movie is a good choice if you like disaster movies, and if you are tired of big Hollywood movies with superstar cast listings.",

      "reviewBody": "In Your Eyes (2014)\n\nA terrific concept—and it unveils early on but if you don&apos;t know it it&apos;s a great surprise—and a well done movie, too. The key is the two main actors, a young man and a young woman in very different circumstances who seem destined for each other.\n\nAnd they are 3000 miles apart. \n\nZoe Kazan (granddaughter of the director) is terrific throughout, playing a well- heeled woman with a controlling husband in beautiful New Hampshire. And Michael Stahl-David plays her counterpart with similar introspective intensity, but as an minor ex-con in a trailer in beautiful New Hampshire. What they have in common is something no one else has—and no one else can know about.\n\nIt&apos;s the ultimate romance movie in that first sense that you know they belong together and circumstances are keeping them apart. But it&apos;s also a romance in a deeper way, because the two get to know each other with extreme openness and intimacy. They naturally fall in love. And the world naturally will not make it easy.\n\nIn many ways the filming is quite solid in a familiar way, not drawing attention to itself except in scenes where two realities are made to blend (crudely). This is all about story and more story. Some of the side characters are imperfectly developed (even the controlling husband doesn&apos;t always resonate quite right). But the two leads are spot on, and their parallel development is our fascination.",

Lou uses hand-held cameras to dizzying effect and shoots mostly in various shades of blue and with an awful lot of rain. What is clear is there is an underground organization, (the Purple Butterfly), dedicated to fighting the Japanese and that there&apos;s a traitor in their midst. Otherwise the plot is reasonably complex and the time structure not always clear while a case of mistaken identity does little to help. Nevertheless, trying to put the pieces together in some kind of logical order turns out to be hugely rewarding and, as I&apos;ve said, it&apos;s visually magnificent with superb performances from the entire cast. Inevitably it will remind you of the cinema of Kar-Wai Wong but Ye Lou remains his own man and even if you need to see this a couple of times to &apos;get it&apos; it will be time well spent.",

Both the 1948 original theatrical release and the 1950 War Dept. release can be found on youtube. The most interesting difference between these two prints of THE ORIGINAL VERSION is that the US release has several mute spots on the soundtrack during the courtroom sequences. These muted sections can be heard in the original 1948 print. The film is a remarkable summary of the crimes committed by and the punishment meted out to the defendants.\n\nAs for the 2009 version, released in2010, that is a different film and should be discussed separately. The score has been re-recorded, new narration has been added, courtroom voices have been restored (they were replaced due to issues of aural clarity). In short, it was created from a new millennial frame of reference.\n\nTo understand the impact of the original film I suggest you seek out the original version. While the youtube print of the 1948 release is poor, there is a gorgeous 35mm print of the 1950 US version.",

Rebecca DeMornay and Mary Gross play off of each other so well (Rebecca&apos;s the &quot;straight-man&quot; and Mary&apos;s the comic relief.)  The girls are trainees in the FBI Academy--chosen because of their gender rather than their skills.  Ellie (Rebecca)is the ex-marine who has no trouble with the physical requirements but can&apos;t do the academics.  Janice (Mary) is the multi-degreed academic standout who can&apos;t pass the physical tests.  Teamed up as roommates, they are forced to work together so both can realize the dream of becoming a Special Agent.  Good clean fun for the whole family. Enjoy!"

      "reviewBody": "¨I&apos;m your ex girlfriend&apos;s boyfriend&apos;s wife.¨\n\nI&apos;d rather sit through an hour long episode of Dr. House, The OC, or Gossip Girl rather than watch this film starring some of the actors from the above mentioned series. The Oranges was directed by Julian Farino, who I had never heard of before this film. I actually went to see this film because I thought it had an interesting cast. The biggest flaw of The Oranges was its screenplay; written by Ian Helfer and Jay Reiss. The dramedy never quite manages to feel authentic and everything felt like a complete farce. The dialogue in this film felt very light considering the subject matter and the comedic moments weren&apos;t effective. The relationships didn&apos;t feel real either, although I must admit that the friendship between Laurie&apos;s character and Platt&apos;s was probably the strongest thing about this movie. Beside the three TV stars: Hugh Laurie, Leighton Meester, and Adam Brody, the film also stars Allison Janney and Catherine Keener whom I always thought looked very much alike. These are all very likable actors, but they were given some really underdeveloped characters and the film never really rang true to me. Other films have tackled this subject matter in much better ways. Examples that come to mind for me are The Graduate and American Beauty, but this movie doesn&apos;t even come close to what those films achieved. Despite how much I wanted to like this movie because of the actors, I had a hard time watching this. I would pick any of their television series over this film anytime.\n\nThe film focuses on the relationship between two Jersey families. On the one hand, we have David (Hugh Laurie) and Paige Walling (Catherine Keener) who have two children: Vanessa (Alia Shawkat) and Toby (Adam Brody), and then we are introduced to their neighbors, the Ostroff&apos;s, consisting of Terry (Oliver Platt) and Carol (Allison Janney). Terry and David have been best friends for a long time, and their families get together often. The Ostroff&apos;s have a daughter named Nina (Leighton Meester) who decides to return home after five years for the Holidays. Her presence will change things when she falls in love with David. The two begin seeing each other and it has a tremendous effect on both families. Nina convinces David that there are no rules to happiness, but at the same time his decision affects everyone around him. When Paige finds out about this relationship she confronts David and soon everyone&apos;s life is affected by this relationship. \n\nThe film doesn&apos;t seem to take sides on the moral issue, but it doesn&apos;t ever feel like it takes things seriously either. The entire film felt like a complete waste of time. The relationship between David and Nina never felt authentic and there was no chemistry whatsoever between them. The film really suffers from a poor script and the likable actors aren&apos;t enough to save this film. The narration of the film didn&apos;t work for me either and I felt like it was simply used to simplify things. The question the film seems to be raising is whether it is really worth doing whatever makes you happy without measuring the consequences and how it can affect the rest of the people around you. At first it seems as if it agrees with this premise, but later their consequences catch up with them. Some characters seem to be better off, but things never remain the same. I think I am getting a little too philosophical for a film that really didn&apos;t take itself too seriously, but I definitely felt that something was completely off with The Oranges. It is an awkward film and one I wouldn&apos;t recommend. \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Maybe, my expectations of this film were set too high. Frankly, I pondered why anyone would want to re-make what many genre fans (and movie buffs in general) already consider to be a cult-classic. Didn&apos;t anyone learn a thing about what usually happens to those who try to reinvent a classic (i.e. the poorly attempted re-make of &apos;Psycho&apos;, anyone?).\n\nFor those of you whom have seen the original 1986 &apos;Hitcher&apos;, it is best to leave your experience to that. The characters in this 2007 version barely conjure up a heartbeat, much-less able to hold the viewers attention for more than a few mere minutes at a time! \n\nThat is not to say that the lack of dramatic affect is due solely to sub-par actors. It&apos;s complacency and sterileness is mostly due to a lack of vision and direction, rather than for a lack of competency on any of the actors behalf. Also, severely lacking is the film&apos;s score, which was a haunting staple in the original version, but which is barely of notice in this version.\n\nDid the &apos;Hitcher&apos; require a reattempting? The answer is clear: No. The producer&apos;s of this film also produced the &apos;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos; reduxs and while those films were successful both artistically as well in terms of box office dollars, their attempt here is quite unsuccessful at attempting to recreate the nerve-pounding suspense that only the original appears to be able to offer.\n\nDo not slow down. Drive past this one and don&apos;t even bother taking a second glance.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In my 8th college year, buying 3-color toothpaste I thought could spare me from my rock bottom situation.&quot; Those are the first words of the film as spoken by Fumiya (Jô Odagiri) just before debt collector Fukuhara (Tomokazu Miura) bursts into his apartment, removing his shoes at the front door as is Japanese custom, and roughs him up. The next day the debt collector offers Fumiya an opportunity to erase his debt: walk with him around Tokyo. What we get is a road movie, a very funny road movie, where the unlikely duo walk instead of drive. There&apos;s eventual male bonding, marvelous footage of Tokyo, and a smörgåsbord of odd characters and situations along the way.\n\nWriter/Director Satoshi Miki has a stable of comedic actors who work with him often and who fill out this film playing the side characters. They remind me of the North American group that came out of Second City Television we now associate with Christopher Guest movies. They share that sense of humor too, where each of the characters seem to exist in their own orbit but since they all do, they get along fine. Dialog is somewhere between non sequiturs and honest answers when you don&apos;t anticipate them. And it&apos;s all about timing and delivery. Funny people.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention the hairstyles of the two main characters. Jô Odagiri, famous Average Joe Japanese actor, sports a Dylanesque-fro, while famous Big Bad Guy actor Tomokazu Miura&apos;s cut seems to suffer from some sort of mullet imbalance. They&apos;re an odd pair perfectly suited to this low-key oddball comedy.\n\nA thrill for me is the appearance of Yuriko Yoshitaka as Fufumi, the niece of the debt collector&apos;s fake wife. She co-starred, at age seventeen, in one of my favorite films of all time, Noriko&apos;s Dinner Table, as the younger sister, Yuka. While that Sion Sono film was no where near a comedy, Yuriko Yoshitaka&apos;s character possessed a bit of the same surreal comportment that works for her in this film. She&apos;s tasked here with playing a loud, extremely happy, self-orientor who likes to put mayonnaise on everything, and pulls it off without being overly obnoxious. Your mileage may vary but I think she&apos;s got a bright future. She seems comfortable acting.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie recently and it blew my mind. The long shots, showing the mundane aspects of life. The camera aiming at the actions rather than the characters, symbolizing the every day ordeal of a conformist life. The eternal agony of a family, who slowly tears apart from everything that connects them with the world.\n\nThis is not a pleasant movie to watch. It&apos;s sad, bleak, disturbing and angry; and Haneke doesn&apos;t make it easier to the viewers. He presents life as it is, without any dramatization; and what it strikes me the most is the pace in which he presents it. The characters doesn&apos;t shout (they speak every once in a while), fight or cry their hearts out; they just keep on doing the same things they do every day. However, as you watch closer, you sense that something is completely wrong.\n\nTo me this is as an existential film as you can get. The world is there: raw, unsympathetic and indifferent. Everything happens without a reason, without hope; and the character&apos;s lack of desire to confront the nothingness of an empty life is the central theme of this movie.\n\n&quot;What happens when people are dead from the inside?&quot; That&apos;s what I asked myself after watching this cold, cynical, gem of a movie. Can be someone dead from the inside and alive from the outside?. If so, could that person communicate with any other person? How can we avoid the meaningless things in life? Should we fight them back or surrender to them? Watch this movie and then you may find the answers to those questions..... or may be not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. Avoid watching it if you&apos;re a bit depressed. This movie is bleak and challenging as hell.",

Pic debuted domestically on video cassette.\n\nBritish thesp David Warbec (veteran of 10 Italian films to date) gets to play a British character for a change, sa Rick Spear, a London cracksman sent to Istanbul on a cockeyed mission: he&apos;s to find the temple of the Sun God which is the resting place of Gilgamesh. A legendary jeweled scepter of the king is inside and can be used as a limitless source of power to the bearer. Because the golden door is booby-trapped (with the entire temple set to self-destruct), a master burglar like Spear is needed for the job.\n\nIf this sounds a bit like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, it&apos;s because Margheritii earlier raided that hit with an interesting variation, &quot;The Hunters of the Golden Cobra&quot;. This time there&apos;s too much padding, as Sperar is tested and then goes hunting for the site, aided by a survivor of a mission over 40 years earlier, Beetle (Alan Collins).\n\nThe Turkish locations are again impressive, but this &quot;Ark&quot; doesn&apos;t pic up steam until the final reels containing cliffhanger derring-do in the em=emple and caverns surrounding it.\n\nSoundtrack features a lovely romantic theme but elsewhere pointlessly includes the main theme from &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "John Ireland heads an excellent cast which is aided by a very good script. Ireland is the &quot;badlands drifter&quot; who inadvertently stumbles into a complex web of twisted family dynamics. \n\nEven at the end of the film it is not entirely clear why the Mexican patriarch played by spaghetti western veteran ROBERTO CAMARDIEL resents his son CHRIS (ROBERT WOODS) so much that he sets him on a path that must surely lead to tragedy.\n\nCAMARDIEL&apos;s behaviour towards his only daughter Barbara (DANIELA GIORDANO) is much more understandable: she stood up to him, and attempted to run away with her lover. It is this situation that IRELAND&apos;s character stumbles into, setting off a chain of events that finally lead him to take action, but show him to be horribly emotionally crippled by his past life.\n\nTom Weisser incorrectly describes the film as &quot;Basically, it&apos;s the story of a drifter who gets caught up in a range war between two powerful ranchers&quot;. \n\nTrue, there are two powerful ranchers but the younger joins forces with CHRIS, to advance his own romantic interest in his sister Barbara.\n\nWeisser also writes off director LEON KLIMOVKSY &quot;static type of &quot;zoom and pan&quot; film-making,&quot; but I found nothing distracting or annoying in either the film&apos;s direction or camera work. The score for this 1969 film is by another veteran of the genre FRANCESCO DE MASI.\n\nOn the Spaghetti Western Scales of Justice I would rate this 7.5/10. This is just one of a handful of westerns where the actions of an overbearing Mexican rancher/landowner are pivotal to the story, eg. A BULLET FOR SANDOVAL comes immediately to mind.",

The effects are well done, as is the cyclops make-up. Kirk Douglas makes a good Ulysses and Silvana Mangano is beautiful as his wife Penelope and seductive in the second role of the witch, Circe.  If you enjoy these kinds of films, this is one of the good ones."

It is directed by one of best directors in Croatia (Dalibor Matanic)and the cast is also very good (Olga Pakalović, Inge Appelt, Ivica Vidović...). Even so, the pour drama academy in Croatia makes the actors play their rolls both in theatre and on the big screen as if playing a Shakespeare tragedy. Even so, it is a &quot;must-see&quot; movie from modern Croatian cinematography. A dramady, a story of a 2 lesbians that rent a flat hoping to keep their things private turns around like a boomerang when the &quot;nice&quot;, old landlady figures out their sexuality. A shocking twist makes way at the second part of the movie. Not a masterpiece, but surely a good movie that occurred in the time when homosexuality in Croatia was thought to be something seen only in USA blockbusters.",

      "reviewBody": "Plaisir a trois (1973) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nMartine (Alice Arno) is released from a mental hospital a year after castrating a man. She returns home to her husband Charles (Robert Woods) and the two immediately start plans to seduce and murder their neighbor&apos;s daughter Cecile (Tania Busselier).\n\nAlso known as HOW TO SEDUCE A VIRGIN, this Jess Franco film is about as weird, perverted and twisted as you&apos;d expect. It&apos;s loosely based off the de Sade story and it&apos;s one that the director had visited before and after. I&apos;ve always been a fan of Franco&apos;s whenever he adapted this story because it usually meant the director could go full force into the perversion that the material needed.\n\nWhat impressed me most here were the actual performances by the entire cast. Both Arno and Woods are flawless as the evil couple and the coldness that both actors bring to their parts really helps the film. Busselier is also extremely good and believable as this virgin that the couple try to bring into their web. You&apos;ve then got Lina Romay doing a very good job playing a mute, which is the type of role she was always great at. Howard Vernon and Alfred Baillou are also good in their small supporting roles.\n\nFranco made over a dozen films in 1973 so it was one of his busiest periods. The director delivers a very professional looking film and a film that certainly contains a dark sense of humor and some perverted material. This certainly ranks as one of the director&apos;s better films. It looks extremely good and Franco manages to paint a twisted tale of seduction, murder and perversion."

Packed with smart dialogue, tense situations and a real feel for detail, Law and Order is undeservedly forgotten",

      "reviewBody": "Jesus wept. I wish that was all I could say about this blundering, self-indulgent idiot of a movie. I am still reeling from the public humiliation meted out to Eugene Hutz and Richard E Grant in this, as another commenter so aptly described it, car-crash of a movie.\n\nThe script they were handed and the movie they ended up embroiled in was the equivalent of them being packed into a bright pink Lada, tweaked up to the gills on meth and viagra, naked, before being forcibly driven at top speed into an oncoming bus-load of school children, with a haul of child porn sitting conspicuously on the back seat.\n\nMadonna&apos;s unmistakable, drooling brand of pretentiousness is smeared all over this particular steaming pile of waste. Although pretentiousness might be a bit generous, as that would suggest at least an entry level modicum of intellect with which she had to work with; this is unadulterated idiocy.\n\nWatching this movie I was constantly reminded of that scene from A Fish Called Wanda where Klein, after being accused of being stupid, responds indignantly &apos;Do stupid people read Russian philosophy?&apos;. Curtis&apos; answer kept running laps around my attention span: &apos;Yes, they do, they just don&apos;t understand it.&apos; This sums up the driving force behind the pretentious, empty-headed fumbles this movie attempts to make in an effort to inject it with some kind of profundity, the like of which will no doubt appeal to people who have never experimented with thinking before, but alas will leave anybody who can spell the word &apos;wheelbarrow&apos; without spell check smacking their heads off the nearest hard surface with contempt for the foolishness being hurled in steaming handfuls at their functioning brains.\n\nThey spray-painted Richard E Grant&apos;s hair gray for crying out loud. Not content with humiliating the man through the woeful string of drivel that was disingenuously entitled a script, they physically marked the man&apos;s person to make him look as foolish as the movie itself. There should be some kind of association for prevention of cruelty to actors set up if you ask me, Madonna would surely get the chair for what she did to Hutz and Grant. For shame...\n\nI&apos;ve given this movie 1 point because I like Hutz and Grant, 1 point because I like Gogol Bordello who provide much of the music and style evident in the movie, and I would give it another point for the car-crash quality that kept me glued to it in disbelief, reveling perversely in how progressively terrible it kept getting by the second.\n\nIt&apos;s that kind of morbid fascination you get if you smell a really bad fart, disgusting, repulsive, but morbidly fascinating that it can actually be that bad and actually be getting more repellent. But since there are clearly people commenting here who insist on over-rating this nonsense, waste-of-time testament to Madonna&apos;s failed education, I will withhold that third point.\n\nIf you like Grant or Hutz, avoid this movie at all costs; it&apos;s like watching them ritually humiliated by an idiot in the crudest and most unfortunate of fashions for a length of time that could qualify for a human rights violation. You will weep for them. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Guy Richie decided to distance himself from his missus on the strength of having seen this movie alone.",

I have many movies on my computer that I haven&apos;t seen yet but I chose this one because I wanted a comedy, badly.\n\nI liked Alana De La Garza&apos;s facial expressions, very cute. David Boreanaz wasn&apos;t bad either. I think he&apos;s very good at facial expressions too. He has this big smile you won&apos;t forget.\n\nI had a blast watching this. Not a hint of boredom. I can say this because I was sitting in front of a computer screen, I can pause it or stop watching it altogether if I really want to.(unlike the movie theater, you almost have to finish the movie so your buck wouldn&apos;t got to waste) But I didn&apos;t.\n\nThis movie is kind of like Click (2006). Full comedy in the beginning, then romance and sadness near the end.",

From the tense intro till the end, the film lives up to the excellence of the book, capturing the mystery, the characters quite well. The landscape lends itself to the suspense - and the action is gritty and exciting, especially at the end ( the ranch in the cave is well-imagined.)\n\nThough there&apos;s action, it never overrides the narrative, and the focus is on Richard Crenna, looking cool, all dressed in black looking like Johnny Cash, who has lost his memory after an attempt on his life. From there, with the help of the underrated Stephen Boyd, he tries to learn who he is, and for his efforts he gets a passel load of bullets heading his way.\n\nGreat cast - Farley Granger, Rosanna Schiaffino and the hottie villainess Patty Shepherd. - great action. A bit confusing at times, but amnesiac films - like Bourne identity - tend to have this streak, and you have to sit it out and be patient and you&apos;ll soon get the answers. Maybe the dialogue could&apos;ve been sharper, more clearer, however, it is a solid western that should get more attention.",

      "reviewBody": "The serial killer genre is the most overdone in modern cinema, but director Terrence Mallick took a real life story to make his powerful debut, &apos;Badlands&apos;.  He even toned it down, his interest being not in presenting a picture of pure (and wholly artificial) evil but rather in portraying a wholly human story.  Murder is depicted here in all its banality - people shot (off-screen) through locked doors, by a young man acting for wholly normal motives but without the customary restraints on behaviour that we term morals.  The result is a haunting, though occasionally pretentious, study of individuals drifting beyond the bounds of civilisation, their physical location (America&apos;s still-wild west) symbolically matching their mental isolation.  Sissy Spacek is particularly good as the ordinary girl just along for the ride.  A fine film, &apos;Badlands&apos; is also genuinely disturbing, in a way that Hannibal Lector could only dream of.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Early spring&quot; is a film from the latter part of the career of Yasujiro Ozu. Normally the age of the lead character develops in line with the age of Ozu himself. With a lead character in its early 30s &quot;Early spring&quot; is an exception.\n\nThe films of Yasujiro Ozu are all about family relations. An extramarital relationship, as in &quot;Early spring&quot;, is very rare and for Ozu rather daring (how innocent it may seem to us in todays eyes).\n\nBoth exceptions may well have something to do with a rivalry between the two Japanese studios Shochiku (the studio of Ozu) and Daiei, were Shuchiko was losing ground to Daiei.\n\nMore unexpected to me was the negative tone about office work in the movie. At the beginning of the movie we see clerks travelling to their office and the emphasis is laid on their massiveness and anonymity. Later in the film some office clerks are talking to each other and confess that their work is rather dull and only the game of mahjong after work is done is giving them some fun. Last but not least at the end of the film some older colleages advise the lead character not to put all his cards on his career. His mentor even says that it is more important to be loyal to your wife than to your employer, because the last mentioned loyalty is bound to be unreciprocal. Al this is a far cry from what I thought to know about work ethic during Japanese reconstruction. As a faithfull chronicler of the Japanese middle class post World War II Ozu probably sensed the changing cultue correctly.\n\nThe technique and form of Ozu is, as always, impeccable. The tranquil pace, the intermediate shots without characters and the careful composition of the images in the characteristic low camera angle Ozu style. All this is in no way inferior to &quot;Tokyo story&quot; (1953), his more well known masterpiece from 3 years earlier.",

      "name": "Achieves Excellence!",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; is a movie which has achieved excellence.  The story line is fast-moving and packed with nuance.  Various elements of the plot overlap and blend for a harmonious whole.  It is not a series of action scenes played primarily for visual impact, but a compelling story which demands attentive viewing.\n\nFlashback scenes are intentionally cartoonish, so that the audience, like the character of the boy Walter, is left wondering whether the fantastic tales of the old uncles&apos; adventurous youth are really to be believed. Uncle Garth tells the stories, which we see through Walter&apos;s imagination.  We see in the flashbacks what Walter envisions as he hears the stories, and Walter doesn&apos;t have the age and experience to see anything other than the caricatures which appear in the flashback scenes.  It&apos;s not a photo-accurate rendition, it&apos;s what a youngster imagines while listening to oral storytelling.  For instance, a twelve-year-old Texan in the 1950s wouldn&apos;t have been likely to know what a really angry Sheik would have looked like in the 1920s.  These flashbacks, and the ways in which they are depicted, are central to the plot of the movie.  Through his storytelling, without realizing it, Uncle Garth nurtures a creative potential in Walter (who will grow up to become a cartoonist).\n\nChristian Kane is a magnificent casting choice as young Uncle Hub (the younger incarnation of Duvall&apos;s character), displaying just the right kind of spark for the daring adventurer.  Kyra Sedgwick is eerily believable as Walter&apos;s shallow and self-absorbed mother.  The family of hick relatives is superbly annoying.\n\nHaley Joel Osment delivers a solid portrayal of Walter.  Sometimes his voice sounds like that of a boy, sometimes like that of a young man, as would be expected in a male of Walter&apos;s age.  Sometimes Walter cries like a child, sometimes he displays stoic maturity, as would be expected from a boy who is in the transition of becoming a man.  We see Walter unsure of himself in the beginning, but later finding his footing.  Not too sugary, not too hard-edged, Haley Joel Osment is ideal for the role.  He may be overshadowed by Caine and Duvall, but actually holds his own reasonably well, working between these two living legends.\n\nMichael Caine&apos;s accent as Uncle Garth is a perfect portrayal of a Texan who has lived outside Texas for much of his life.  Garth is no bumpkin hick, but a man who has traveled the world, and in light of his experiences it would not have been credible to give this character a strong country drawl. Even though, as the plot progresses, we don&apos;t know how much of Garth&apos;s fantastic storytelling we should believe, there is never a question of whether Garth has ventured outside the Texas borders.  (Education and travel tend to have the effect of diminishing regional accents.  I have lived in Texas for twenty years, and have known many older native Texans whose diction is much like Garth&apos;s.)  Michael Caine gives Uncle Garth just the right combination of toughness and tenderness, and treads the fine line of allowing us to see Garth as a trustworthy character regardless of his adventurous stories.\n\nThe uncles are very realistic characterizations, and Texas holds many characters like them.  The aging uncles had, as young men, gone away to find adventure, and lived on the edge for much of their lives.  Then they returned home to retire in a rural Texas setting which they were finding to be just a little too tame, no longer remembering much about Texas country life except for acquiring the obligatory too many dogs.  The uncles don&apos;t say much to each other because there is no need to say much, they understand each other perfectly.  Confronted with age, they seek out reckless behavior, unwilling to sit still and get older, unable to overtly give up on life. Walter&apos;s presence suddenly requires them to adapt to new purpose, and to take care of themselves, too, as they are faced with the issue of providing appropriate male role models so that their young nephew might one day become an appropriate man.\n\nDespite the studio&apos;s description, this is not a &quot;heartwarming&quot; movie with a happy, fluffy resolution for all concerned.  The characters must make choices, and not always easy ones.  The valiant tales of adventure don&apos;t always conclude with happily-ever-after fairytale endings.  It is not purely a comedy, but instead probes the depths of emotion.  The adult audience will probably appreciate this movie the most, but it is an appropriate movie for pre-teens as well.",

      "reviewBody": "Lori Silverbush and Kristi Jacobson&apos;s documentary &quot;A Place at the Table&quot; is a film that every politician - indeed, every citizen - in America should be forced to sit through at least once (or as many times as it takes to get the message to effectively sink in). It makes a very persuasive case that, contrary to what most people think, hunger is a major problem in the United States, a nation that prides itself on being the wealthiest in the history of the world. Not only does the movie provide the startling statistics necessary to back that assertion up, but explains why this is the case.\n\nSilverbush and Jacobson build their case in a meticulous, logical fashion, beginning with the common, counterintuitive fallacy that hungry people necessarily equal thin people. The movie explains how obesity and hunger often go hand in hand, thanks to the fact that, since junk food is cheaper than healthy food to purchase, the poor often fill up on empty calories rather than the nutritious ones that would actually make them healthy. This is a result of a misguided federal policy that provides subsidies for agribusinesses (as opposed to mom-and-pop farmers), who turn their grain and corn into inexpensive processed foods. Since farmers who grow fruits and vegetables work more independently of one another, they don&apos;t have the clout necessary to receive similar government support. This leads to a vicious cycle that winds up hurting poor people in both urban and rural areas where &quot;food deserts&quot; arise in which residents can barely find a fresh fruit or vegetable to purchase.\n\nThe movie rightly celebrates the many charities that pick up some of the slack, but it makes the case that that is simply not enough, that an entire paradigm shift may be necessary if we ever hope to solve the problem.\n\nUltimately, what we discover is that hunger is merely a symptom of a much greater set of problems - which are poverty, income inequality and a political system rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the indigent and disconnected. Above all, the key lies in both the public and private sectors providing a living wage for their workers.\n\nFinally, beyond all the statistics, beyond all the comments by experts and authorities on the subject, it is the voices of the parents, who can&apos;t afford to put nutritious food on the table for their children, and of the children themselves, who often go to bed hungry or malnourished, who wind up making the greatest mark on our hearts. It is their testimonials more than anything else that will hopefully move the rest of us to action.\n\nA must-see film.",

It started out with Angela Lansbury as a self-centered woman who was fearful that her husband (Walter Pidgeon) would be drawn back to his old flame.  Lansbury was quite good as the wife who had an interesting approach to this situation. But later, the movie turned into a story about a young woman (Janet Leigh, doing a good British accent), who turns to Pidgeon for help and inadvertently causes a host of problems for him.  Deborah Kerr is also good as Pidgeon&apos;s old girlfriend, but even with the good cast, the movie overall is little more than a confused soap opera, and the ending doesn&apos;t make much sense.  Not one I&apos;d recommend, unless you&apos;re a particular fan of anybody in the cast."

      "reviewBody": "Those hostile little beasts are at it again in this adequately entertaining sequel. It takes quite a while for it to really get started, but the final half hour is worth waiting for. It&apos;s actually played fairly straight for a while, with comedy elements getting introduced more and more as the movie goes on. The Ghoulies themselves are definitely cute in an ugly sort of way, and are a genuinely amusing bunch. Fortunately, some of the human characters manage to be almost as interesting.\n\nAfter an attempt to kill the Ghoulies fails, they hitch a ride with a truck carrying the contents of &quot;Satans&apos; Den&quot;, a house of horrors for a travelling carnival. They hide out inside Satans&apos; Den for a while, intermittently killing people, until the big finale when they finally break out. The place has been hurting financially, but when patrons get a look at the Ghoulies and assume them to be part of the act, business starts booming.\n\nI have to be partial to any movie featuring the following elements: an appearance by old Hollywood pro Royal Dano, who&apos;s in fine form as drunken old Uncle Ned, a song by the metal band W.A.S.P. (&quot;Scream Until You Like It&quot;), old school effects (puppeteering, stop motion animation, etc.), a role for Italian exploitation veteran Romano Puppo (&quot;2019: After the Fall of New York&quot;), and a carnival atmosphere (even if done on a budget). Production design, by Giovanni Natalucci, and cinematography, by Sergio Salvati, are both well done.\n\nThe enjoyable cast features familiar faces from other horror films: Kerry Remsen (&quot;Pumpkinhead&quot;), Sasha Jenson (&quot;Halloween 4&quot;), Starr Andreeff (&quot;Dance of the Damned&quot;), William Butler (&quot;Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III&quot;), and Donnie Jeffcoat (&quot;Night of the Demons&quot; &apos;88). Damon Martin (&quot;Pee-wee&apos;s Big Adventure&quot;) is our likable young lead, Phil Fondacaro (who played the title role in &quot;Troll&quot;) the engaging Sir Nigel Penneyweight, and J. Downing the appropriately odious money man Mr. Hardin.\n\nOverall, agreeable entertainment for genre fans; produced and directed by Albert Band, veteran director and father of Charles Band of Empire Pictures and Full Moon fame.\n\nSix out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "War of the Worlds(2005) is far from the best version, coming from someone who has a lot of fondness for the 1953 film, but I don&apos;t think it was that bad. The Asylum are notorious for making atrocious movies, most of them without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. War of the Worlds is not one of the worst, in fact alongside I Am Omega, #1 Cheerleader Camp and When a Killer Calls it is one of their better movies. If War of the Worlds 2 is a sequel to this, that is a thousand times worse than this. It does have its major problems almost certainly, the dialogue has certainly been much worse before with Asylum&apos;s movies but apart from some very well-thought out moments it is often too talky and aimless here. Other problems are that the special effects are terrible, Jack Busey overacts dreadfully and the score is generic and forgettable. On the plus side, the photography is a far cry from the slipshod quality you come to expect from The Asylum and the scenery and settings are beautifully evoked, or so I think. The story has moments where it is slow but there are also some thrilling moments and the ending works much better than it does in Spielberg&apos;s film. The characters aren&apos;t the most interesting on the block but generally they do have some likability, Victor actually is a well-rounded character. And the acting is better than average, Busey excepted. Thomas C.Howell is a commanding lead, I have read reviews complaining about over-exaggerated gestures(ie.flailing arms) but actually I find that more true to his performances in The Da Vinci Treasure, The Day the Earth Stopped and War of the Worlds 2. Tinarie Van-Wyk Loots is underused but she is very sexy and brightens up the screen whenever she appears, her nude scene didn&apos;t seem all that out of place to me. Of the supporting roles, Rhett Giles stood out, this is a man who has been in a lot of rubbish but has obvious talent that shines through even in those films. His performance is a huge part why Victor was as likable as he was to me. In conclusion, I hate Asylum&apos;s movies with a burning passion but I was actually pleasantly surprised by this one(just making this point before I get accused of being a &quot;shill of the company&quot; or &quot;friend of the director&quot;). 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Irreconcilable Differences is one of the best movies of the 80s and quite possibly the most underrated love story ever made.  For whatever reason, audiences chose to ignore this well-written and well-acted gem in 1984.  I think it may have been due to the marketing campaign -- they tried to sell it as a cutesy gimmick movie where a precocious child &quot;divorces&quot; her parents.  But that isn&apos;t what this movie is about at all.  This movie is able to provide strong commentary about failed relationships, especially when egos, power, and greed substitute for the things that should really matter in a person&apos;s life.  In addition, it creates a viable love story that doesn&apos;t resort to typical Hollywood formulas when it creates the conflicts that may or may not separate these two people who we know belong with each other.  We the audience get to see them actually fall in love on the screen before our very eyes.  You would think this should be fairly standard, but how many movies can you recall (especially recently) that you can say that about?  This is done through great acting, writing, and directing.  Notice how Shelley Long&apos;s voice changes over the years as she goes through the various changes in her life.  Watch Ryan O&apos;Neal&apos;s eyes toward the end as you can actually see an inner peace that he never had earlier.\n\nThese are just a few of the great things I loved about this great, heartwarming, and underappreciated film.  If you want a great love story with some very good comic and dramatic moments as well, rent this movie! You won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "Rating: *** out of ****\n\nOn first impression, I enjoyed Returner very much, but I can easily see why many others didn&apos;t care for it. The movie&apos;s plot is a rip-off of countless American blockbusters (just on first viewing I see E.T., The Terminator, Back to the Future, ID4, Stargate, Dune, The Matrix, MI:2, and even a little bit of The X-Files) and there&apos;s nothing really all that special in the way the story is executed but in general most Asian action flicks don&apos;t have much plot so I at least count it a blessing that ripping off all the aforementioned films gives the film enough story to sustain interest.\n\nTakeshi Kineshiro stars as Miyamoto, a mercenary who has an agenda against Yakuza boss Mizoguchi (Goro Kishitani). But before he can fulfill his vengeance, a time-traveling girl (Ann Suzuki) interrupts his task, giving Mizoguchi the opportunity to escape. Frustrated, Miyamoto takes the dazed girl back to his apartment. There, she informs him her name is Miri and that she&apos;s traveled back from the year 2084 to save the world from an incoming alien invasion.\n\nNaturally, he doesn&apos;t believe her, but finds he has no choice but to help her when she tapes a bomb to his neck. Miri informs him that an alien spacecraft has crashed and the surviving crew member will signal the mothership, thus instigating the war between humans and these aliens called the Daggra. Joining Miri&apos;s mission to kill this surviving alien, Miyamoto gradually believes her when he witnesses some astonishing sights. But what should be an easy task proves difficult when the Yakuza get involved and want the alien technology for themselves.\n\nJapan&apos;s first (or maybe they&apos;ve done it before, I sure as hell don&apos;t know) attempt at crafting a summer blockbuster that can rival those of American cinema is an unqualified success as a work of great entertainment. It delivers what one would expect from a popcorn blockbuster: fast-paced thrills, big laughs, and visual spectacle, but there&apos;s a layer of genuine heart and emotion that propels this far above the crap one could expect from Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer.\n\nTakeshi Kaneshiro is understandably one of Asia&apos;s biggest heartthrobs, the man looks great in tousled hair and long trench coats. But along with the cool exterior, he boasts solid acting talent to go with all that charisma. No doubt, he&apos;ll probably be Asian cinema&apos;s most popular star within the next five years. Ann Suzuki also impresses as the young teen who&apos;s had to grow up fast for her age. It&apos;s the natural and sweet rapport the two develop that raises the stakes; the addition of human interest makes the action and the story more compelling. As the hilariously laconic and irredeemably evil Mizoguchi, Goro Kishitani is fun to watch, his villainous performance evoking a mix of past work from Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman.\n\nReturner boasts numerous terrific action sequences, rousing gun battles that employ fluid camera-work and stylish slow motion. The opening setpiece, with Kineshiro taking down scores of Yakuza, is a total blast and the coolest opening sequence since Equilibrium. Some of the action scenes employ bullet-time techniques, but that&apos;s thankfully limited to only a few moments. There&apos;s a potentially cool motorcycle chase that ends way too quickly, but otherwise, the action is first rate.\n\nAs for the f/x, I was really quite impressed. I don&apos;t know what budget this film had to work with, but the visuals are mostly excellent. Most of the f/x are at least on par with a Sci-Fi Channel miniseries (like Children of Dune), and occasionally are up there with even expensive Hollywood blockbusters (the effects sure as hell are better than, say, The Core). The CGI work on the alien mothership is gorgeous, a definite improvement on the model work from Independence Day.\n\nReturner is not without its faults. There are a few moments that are simply too similar to its &quot;inspirations.&quot; The riffs from Independence Day go all the way down to the inclusion of telepathy, alien body armor, and force fields. The battle sequence between the aliens and the last human outpost is gripping. The sets, the direction, and the f/x are all impeccably handled in this setpiece. It probably should have been the film&apos;s highlight, but the scene is marred by some poor acting from foreign actors who clearly shouldn&apos;t be trying to fake American accents.\n\nBut despite its blatant unoriginality, Returner is spirited and thrilling. The climax, set aboard an ocean-bound oil rig, is an exhilarating race against time amid several blazing gun battles. There&apos;s some sentimentality on hand, and I&apos;ll even admit I got a bit choked up near the end. Admittedly, the movie runs a bit long after all the action, but there&apos;s a nice post-climactic plot twist that should please most sci-fi fans.\n\n(Major spoiler warning) I gather that the filmmakers were assuming that once Miri returned to the future, she&apos;d still have the same memories of the former timeline (a la Back to the Future, Frequency), thus enabling her to save Miyamoto. But I&apos;m not sure why she&apos;d automatically return to the future after thwarting the war, or why she didn&apos;t arrive after Miyamoto realized she&apos;d saved his life to spend some time with him (End spoiler).\n\nAnd what&apos;s up with playing a Lenny Kravitz song over the end credits? It&apos;s a bit of a distraction for an otherwise rather touching final scene. But on the whole, Returner is enthusiastically recommend to sci-fi action fans."

Such resistance is the basis for this perceptive adult drama on marital strife.\n\nRuth Chatterton is ideally cast, looking young while obviously no longer in her early thirties.  Her frivolous banter provides a dramatic clash with Walter Hutson&apos;s aging hero.  \n\nWhile I find &quot;Dodsworth&quot; strangely depressing, it&apos;s a personal reaction, for this is a very well conceived and produced film, securely directed by William Wyler, and solidly scripted by Sidney Howard.\n\nMary Astor shows warmth as &quot;the other woman&quot; and Spring Byington offers an emotional balance to the proceedings. With excellent cinematography and art direction, &quot;Dodsworth&quot; remains a telling adult drama of the dangers which may transpire by not surrendering youthful matters to advancing years."

True, some of the laughs were simply because some people were in this movie that had NO BUSINESS being in it, because they are considered to belong to a higher echelon of movies. Christopher Walken and Maggie Q are usually seen in LARGE blockbusters or high-profile indies; George Lopez has a very successful TV series, not to mention MANY cameos from well-known comedic actors. These people are GOOD. When they are on the screen, funny stuff happens. The script is an obvious parody on the movie &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot;, but with ping-pong in lieu of kung-fu or karate. It also spoofs the &quot;underdog&quot; motif like the &quot;Rocky&quot; movies. I dunno, all I can say is that I REALLY enjoyed this movie. I didn&apos;t expect much, and I got a lot back because of that. True, I was a little liquored up, and a second sober viewing might not pay off repeat dividends, but I had a good time. Isn&apos;t that really what it&apos;s all about? Honestly, it ain&apos;t Citizen Kane, but I&apos;ve seen crappier movies... a contemporary comparison: I was NOT disappointed by this movie, and comparatively much more disappointed with the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie...\n\nYaaarrrr, thar be worse things under the sun, matey...",

      "reviewBody": "Sahara (1943) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nExciting and highly entertaining WW2 drama has Humphrey Bogart playing the leader of a tank crew who are slowly trying to make their way to safety by crossing the Sahara Desert. Soon the group of men begin to struggle as the sand storms and lack of water begin to have a toll on them so they decide to give their lives and battle a large number of German&apos;s. This is certainly one of the better WW2 dramas out there and I guess it&apos;s what you&apos;d call a &quot;man&apos;s movie&quot; since there isn&apos;t a single woman in the film. The movie works so well because of the wonderful cast who turn in some great and memorable performances. Bogart leads the way and turns in another winning performance but I&apos;d stop short of calling it amongst his best. He certainly fits that tough guy role better than anyone in history so there&apos;s no problem believing anything his character is doing. The supporting cast is where the real greatness is as several members are able to outshine Bogie. J. Carrol Naish gives one of his greatest performances with a spot on Italian accent. It&apos;s a real shame so many people just remember Naish from his later day exploitation titles because he was certainly one of the better character actors from this era. Lloyd Bridges, Rex Ingram, Bruce Bennett and Richard Nugent also add great support. Guy Kingsford also should receive special attention as Stegman. I think the best part of the movie is the first sixty-minutes or so where the men are having to deal with the desert as their main enemy. The effects of them dealing with a sand storm was very well done as was a terrific scene where the men get to taste water for the first time in days. I think the later part of the story gets a tad bit far fetched but one should also keep in mind that movies like this were being made to make those watching them feel proud of the troops battling in the real war."

      "reviewBody": "MY YOUNG AUNTIE (1981) is a clever Hong Kong comedy incorporating kung fu battles, starring and directed by master kung fu director Lau Kar Leung (aka Liu Chia Liang), who takes a break here from more intense kung fu fests like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN and EXECUTIONERS FROM SHAOLIN. The story, set in the early 20th century, involves a dispute over family property after Lau is visited by the very pretty young widow (Kara Hui Ying Hung) of his aged uncle. Because of her status as the wife of the eldest family member, she&apos;s considered the senior member and the others defer to her. (She also knows kung fu.) When another, greedier relative, played by perennial villain Wang Lung Wei, disputes the will, this leads to a major kung fu battle between Lau and Wang. Appearing in a comic supporting role as a guitar-strumming college boy is Gordon Liu.\n\nMuch of the comedy arises from country bumpkin-in-the-big city-type gags as the young widow, newly arrived from the rural countryside, tries to fit in. At one point, she buys a whole new outfit, overdressing in a fancy white gown, high heels and jewelry, but she winds up getting into a kung fu fight anyway. At one point the college boys stage a costume ball: Kara goes as Marie Antoinette, while her great nephew, played by Hsiao Hou, who&apos;s the same age as her, goes as Robin Hood. Gordon Liu is one of the Three Musketeers and gets into a sword fight with a couple of thugs dressed as musketeers also. It&apos;s all a lot of fun, as long as you don&apos;t mind the comedy upstaging the kung fu for a change."

      "reviewBody": "Catherine Keener (as Amelia) spends the opening scenes putting down everyone in her life. She doesn&apos;t like best friend Anne Heche (as Laura)&apos;s engagement ring. She calls video store geek Kevin Corrigan (as Bill), who wants to date her, &quot;The Ugly Guy&quot;. She repeatedly calls ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Liev Schreiber (as Andrew) an ass----, for enjoying telephone sex. Her cat has cancer. And, her kitchen sponge stinks.\n\nIntriguing character study, from writer/director Nicole Holofcener. Ms. Keener&apos;s &quot;Amelia&quot; seems to have a lot going for her; she is funny and attractive, and, she manages to keep friendships while being excessively judgmental. Things may have started going wrong for her when roommate Heche moved in with boyfriend Todd Field (as Frank). Mr. Field becomes another supportive friend, however. Although Keener is cranky throughout, she eventually proves to be an interesting, supportive friend.\n\nThe performances are all terrific. Mr. Corrigan may be most memorable, as the horror movie geek Keener labels &quot;The Ugly Guy&quot;; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine. Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly, though. Then, again, hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn&apos;t so ugly. Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff (as Peter) play a waiter so well, and an actor so poorly. &quot;Walking and Talking&quot; manages to be a story about meaningful friendship without being terribly meaningful.\n\n****** Walking and Talking (1996) Nicole Holofcener ~ Catherine Keener, Anne Heche, Kevin Corrigan",

For coal-miner&apos;s son Keanu Reeves the answer is a no-brainer: his father is a Vietnam War veteran turned ultra-conservative; his feisty mother is having an affair with dad&apos;s best buddy; and his only friend is a socially marginalized, die-hard hippie. Meanwhile everyone thinks Reeves has problems, but he&apos;s only trying to avoid conforming to Middle America&apos;s messy ideas about normality. And since a rebel in the 1980s needs some sort of cause, he invents one: kidnapping his own father and holding him hostage. There&apos;s more than one contrivance in the otherwise original and unpredictable screenplay: the young protagonist&apos;s mechanical aptitude and closet intellect (he likens himself to Socrates, who was killed for daring to tell the truth) don&apos;t fit his delinquent image, and the kidnapping scheme carries the plot too far into fantasy. But if nothing else the film is an offbeat satire of modern domestic friction, and a refreshing change of pace from the usual condescending screen treatments of adolescent angst.",

It tells the story of a boy meets girl, falls in love, but her family are not happy for some reason. At the end the boy gets beaten up by her family of goons, but suddenly does some exercise and beats up all 100 of the goons by himself. He saves the day and lives happily ever after. We have seen this kind of story in a million Bollywood films already. This is one of the worst versions of a off repeated script. Forget fairy tales, this is a rough scrap movie, with two popular actors casted to make money out of the audience. Do not spend money buying this movie is the advice i will give. Hritek Roshan delivers a disgraceful performance and is one of the most overrated actors in Bollywood (two or three good films). Amisha Patel is so sexy with a amazing figure, but even she couldn&apos;t save the movie from being the Worst film of the year. She gives an annoying performance as the scared girl that keeps heavy breathing all the time. It really got on my nerves. This is a complete nonsense movie, with some disgraceful action scenes coming from a good director.",

      "reviewBody": "The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a road-movie! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynch-cocktail of violence, sex and of coursebizarre characters. I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a normal human being&apos;. As usually, Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who&apos;re all messed up in the head pretty bad. Yet, I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch&apos;s most accessible film (outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story). The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow. Unlike the previous Blue Velvet, I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious side-chapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula&apos;s cousin Dell (Crispin Glover), the torture of Harry Dean Stanton&apos;s character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch&apos;s talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put: this movie is COOL! It&apos;s a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat follow-up to Blue Velvet&apos;s Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchy-trigger-fingers! It&apos;s a damn shame he hasn&apos;t got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn&apos;t the greatest masterpiece out there, but you should love it for what it is: an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thought-provoking values and an extraordinary love-lesson.",

The film jumps around between a few different, barely interconnected stories, yet none of these segments are explored enough to draw the audience in. For example, towards the end of the film, I began to realize that Greg Kinnear had completely disappeared from the movie without a trace. He is not again seen until the ending credits. The film seems to pride itself on continually throwing in more and more familiar faces, yet these actors prove to be more of a distraction than anything else. Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Avril Lavigne, Bruce Willis, and others all pop up for a brief scene or two, yet for the most part, they fail to leave any lasting impression. At the films end, I left the theater feeling no more enlightened, no more informed, and no more interested in the topics discussed throughout the movie. Richard Linklater is a great director, and he has cast some great actors, but still, Fast Food Nation fails to compel or leave any sort of impact. My guess is that a year from now, most people will have forgotten about this movie entirely.",

      "reviewBody": "A young family stop off at a lay-by on their way home.  At the lay-by they meet bounty hunter Charlie who warns them about something living in the woods.  However that `something&apos; has just attached it self under their mobile home and hitches a ride back to their tenement block where the critters cause havoc amongst the residents.\n\nLets be honest  no one say to be shocked to discover this is a cheap little film that doesn&apos;t have too much going for it.  The plot is the usual  people hunted by critters  stuff, this time in a building so it&apos;s like Die Hard with aliens.err no!  The story doesn&apos;t matter as the action is what counts.\n\nSadly the action is poor  it&apos;s not really gory and the critter attacks are always more funny than thrilling.  There is no real excitement or tension and it&apos;s all a bit predictable  take a guess who&apos;ll live and who&apos;ll die  the cute kids or the evil landlord?  See!  The one thing it does have though is a sort of humour  the critters have senses of humours and are cruel and some of this is amusing.\n\nHowever the comedy is nowhere near the one it aspires to  Gremlins, and really the funniest bit is how silly the whole thing is. Needless to say the acting is poor  some people can&apos;t even be mauled convincingly.  But it&apos;s interesting to see DiCaprio&apos;s debut, even if he looks about 9 years old!\n\nReally this is a bit of dumb fun that is daft and slightly shoddy.  It&apos;s may just pass the time but there are much better horror/comedies out there if you want them."

      "reviewBody": "In the 80&apos;s South Korean films as well as TV dramas were almost identically typical in their monotonous plots, stereotyped characters and lack of variety. True, those were the dark ages--ruled by army generals with not much freedom of speech or media, etc. However, interestingly enough, this movie, in the 21st century democracy, attempted to depict an unforgettable (and unforgivable) historical event of 1980 with the very 1980 methods: monotonous, stereotyped and boring... How typical! Unbelievable! It could have been (and indeed should&apos;ve been) a lot greater movie if it had been for a better director, a better scriptwriter (whoever could&apos;ve done a lot more research than those involved in this failure) because it--the Kwangju Massacre--was one of the most important civil uprisings in the country&apos;s modern history.\n\nI was a kid when it happened (fortunately I was living abroad) and I remember watching the news coverage on TV. I watched this movie in a theater in Seoul, and I saw quite a few young students walking out within the first 40-50 minutes. The only reason I sat through the movie was I &quot;knew&quot; about this historical event. If I hadn&apos;t known at all, I wouldn&apos;t have even bothered to sit still for 30 minutes. I really wished I could either cry or laugh during the movie; I just couldn&apos;t sympathize with any part.\n\nMany Korean filmmakers--unlike those who made &quot;Tae Guk Gi&quot; for example--are very capable of ruining great stories...the very true stories given to them on a silver platter so that they didn&apos;t have to agonize themselves over creating a great fiction in the first place.\n\nI give this movie 5 stars only because it is based on a true story.",

She paused. Reacted to that touch. Slowly turned her head around and LOOKED at the offending appendages.\n\nThis entire moment of horror and violation took about four to six seconds. \n\nHer mind - finally - comprehended it. IT had touched her.\n\nThen she lost it. \n\nOne of the best screams in film history. Great acting and just overwhelming. \n\nFor that one scene, I love this movie. Creepy as hell!"

      "reviewBody": "There was a time when I was working in a video-store or, as we call them in Germany, videothek. Good times and the pay wasn&apos;t bad either. It was a shared duty of all involved to sporadically check the DVDs for errors. It happened now and again that customers would wander in, complaining that the film didn&apos;t work – and of course that they didn&apos;t want to pay for a defect film. So, those films were taken home by the employees and watched with German diligence. (Just on the side: 90 percent of the times the disc and film was in perfect order and of course the customers merely tried to get off free; but that&apos;s another story). As you might imagine, this sent all imaginable kind of films through my player – don&apos;t even get me started on what we had to check which came from the &quot;Adult-section&quot;.\n\nNow, why am I brattling on about days past, certainly boring the reader beyond patience? I&apos;ll tell you: as justification. And I assure anybody reading these lines, in any other circumstance I wouldn&apos;t have touched anything related to &quot;Erkan &amp; Stefan&quot; with a ten-foot-pole. But then came the faithful day when a cross-eyed teen in baggie-pants and over-sized baseball cap appeared before the counter, mumbling something about &quot;didn&apos; work, voll krass, eyh&quot;. So, here I was with &quot;Erkan &amp; Stefan – Der Tod kommt krass&quot; at my hands, cursing god and humanity, even trying to haggle with a female co-worker to exchange this film with the one she had to check (a porn involving fecal matters, if memory serves right). She refused.\n\nIf you&apos;re not familiar with the &quot;comedic&quot;-duo Erkan &amp; Stefan, consider yourself lucky. In layman&apos;s terms, we could compare them as the German answer to Ali G. aka Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of Ali G. Or, to call it&apos;s by the real name: they&apos;re ripping off Ali G. In reality two rather mediocre comedians from Bavaria, the two have slipped into the role of a Turk and a German, both bred and raised in the seedier, ghetto-part of Munich. Their trademark is combining local Bavarian slang with Denglish (a bastardization of German with English words) and Kanak Sprak (also called &quot;Kanakendeutsch&quot;, spoken predominantly by Turkish youth in the third or fourth generation, who still haven&apos;t managed to grasp the basics of German). Their most infamous &quot;word-creation&quot; (of which, unfortunately, there are many) is &quot;eyh, krass&quot; or alternatively &quot;voll krass&quot;. Apart from the Latin origin of &quot;crassus&quot;, the word means nothing, apart from something being extreme, both in the positive and negative sense. Sometimes teens will also utter it without any detectable reason or random mingle it into half-formed sentences. As it is, many of their &quot;word-creations&quot; were eagerly picked up by kids and teenagers who came from the shallower end of the social hierarchy – or shall we say: Kanak Sprak spread like typhus.\n\nThis charade was played over the next ten odd years. While the critics cringed, muttering sweet pillow-talk like &quot;the most untalented Comedy-Stars of the nation&quot; and the &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot;, while language-teachers tore their hair out and parents wept bitter tears over their kids turning into morons, the alter-ego of Erkan &amp; Stefan made those two bozos rich and popular figures. Until the day they dropped their masks on live-TV and implied in fluent German, that they would no longer associate with the scum they&apos;ve catered to and would no longer play morons for morons. One would go on to become a member of the council on behalf of the German party SPD, the other one tried his luck in a couple of movies, appearing next to Corey Feldman in &quot;Lucky Fritz&quot; and Stephen Baldwin in &quot;Shoot the Duke&quot;, before vanishing in the depth of soap-operas and TV-crime-shows. In short, the good news: they&apos;re gone and the bad news: their legacy lives on.\n\nThat should sum it up, unless we&apos;ve forgotten something. Oh, yes, the movie: It&apos;s a rip-off of &quot;Weekend at Bernie&apos;s&quot; and if you&apos;re able to find one single, competent gag or something that would raise as much as a smirk: keep it. From me it gets a round number of points: 0/10 (And if you&apos;re still with me, wondering what I charged the kid who was responsible for me watching this garbage, that he claimed was not working properly: roughly thirty bucks, because the DVD was long overdue).",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the millions of chrysanthemum flowers, ten thousand soldiers and three prominent male cast (Chow Yun Fatt, Jay Chou and Liu Ye), one thing will capture your attention. Make that two.\n\nGong Li and her titillating assets have almost overshadowed everything else in the movie. While it may not be historically accurate for 10th Century Tang Dynasty palace females to dress so scantily, director Zhang Yimou obviously wants to make a stylistic statement right from the opening scene.\n\nHis play with colours was apparent from Hero. Curse of the Golden Flowers presents a kaleidoscope in its grandeur palace setting and elaborate costumes. The final fighting scene lead by Prince Jai (Jay Chou playing Jay?) the prince with golden armored warriors trampling over chrysanthemum is nothing short of impressive.\n\nJay Chou had a difficult time playing Prince Jai, which required more complexity than a cool rider in Initial D. While emotional scenes with Gong Li drew some laughter from the audience, his final scene was noteworthy and articulation has improved.\n\nKudos goes to Chow Yun Fatt and Gong Li. Chow has improved on his accent tremendously (which was very strange in Crouching Tiger) and portrayed the Emperor with magnitude and hysterical outrage. Look out for the scene as the usually mild mannered Chow punishes his son with both rising temper and hair.\n\nWhile the film obviously banks on Gong Li&apos;s bosoms, they shouldn&apos;t distract audience from her exceptional acting. It may be over-the-top at times, but she shows that nobody else can play this vengeful and solitary empress better than her. At this moment, she is the queen of the Chinese cinema.\n\nThe story of betrayal, illicit affairs, chilled relations and dysfunctional families may be run on the mill and overdone. Drawing parallels with The Banquet by Zhang Ziyi is inevitable. Both are about an obsessed empress who craves for a relationship with the prince (Interestingly, both well-known for playing gay roles) and demands for more power from the emperor.\n\nCurse of the Golden Flower is not just soap drama but a period epic to impress with colours, opulence and sheer indulgence.\n\nhttp://themovieclub.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "How love changes our life The whole movie was shot at the view of MoMo, the girl in the photograph shop. But she was not the only curious one. Everyone in the movie wanted to know something they should not peep. But this is not what I&apos;d like to talk about. I&apos;d like to share with you my understanding of the movie from another angle.\n\n&quot;I just want to change a person with my love.&quot; said QianYu. It impressed me earlier than all the rest of the movie. I think it over throughout the whole movie watching and try hard to apprehend it deeply. Thus, my attention is led to how love change the lives of the people in this movie.\n\nQianYu: Start with the protagonistress. She is the only daughter of an entrepreneur. Her husband, ZhengZhong, is an employee of his father&apos;s. She said he didn&apos;t know he married with her because he loved her as an individual or just because she&apos;s the daughter of his boss. But QianYu loves him dearly and whole-heartedly. There&apos;s no housemaid hired in their home and QianYu takes care of ZhengZhong and the whole family herself to make ZhengZhong less uncomfortable and stressed as a subordination of his father in law. She wants to change him and favor him with her devotion and greatest love. She fulfilled a series of conducts with the help of a guard, FengDou, to make sure that she would keep her husband. But what&apos;s the result? She lost him forever. It&apos;s her fierce love that sent her beloved husband, ZhengZhong, to the hell though it is not her original wish. Like the roses she described, either sheer red or pure white, the love she holds disposes her life into spotless happiness or horrible destruction.\n\nZhengZhong: QianYu doubted whether ZhengZhong loved her or not, while I think he did. He carefully protected her and their family. He was involved in an affair with XiaoXia LIANG but stoutly cut the relationship down right after the temporary passion for sex. The scene that he stood on his knees wiping the blood on QianYu in the greenhouse deeply impressed me. He killed XiaoXia LIANG with enormous hatred for he was convinced that XiaoXia LIANG was to blame for all those that hurt his wife and son. He was not a born killer. He never looked down upon XiaoXia and provided her with quite a large sum of money to guarantee her new life in future. He got along with XiaoXia not for love but for releasing himself from the pressure and stress, so he was unable to response to XiaoXia&apos;s love for him. If he were a playboy and possessed no true love for his wife but treated her as a shortcut in career, he would not end up in jail or even death penalty. Instead, he might have chance to enjoy a life with both a mild wife and a sexy lover.\n\nFengDou: If without the money QianYu gave him revealed at the end of the movie, we would have thought he died of his greed. But it was revealed, what did he die for? Why did he do so many mischiefs for nothing? He contributed everything he had, conscience, purity, and his life finally. What did he expect to be returned from all these? This is a question unnecessary for me to answer.\n\nXiaoXia LIANG: Similar to FengDou, she fell in love with a wrong person. The doomed love totally changed her life and led her to her doomed fate.\n\nThings tend to go contrary to one&apos;s wishes. Generally speaking, love must be beautiful and fine. Only hearing the word &quot;love&quot; would arouse us with many happy memories or imaginations. We may say, love is powerful; love conquers everything. Love does change our lives frequently, but we should remember the changes are not always to the bright side.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful movie. \n\nI admit this movie is manipulative, and probably exaggerated for purposes of drama, but what based-on-a-true story movies aren&apos;t? At least it goes after the right things: a father having custody of his kids, rather than them being forced to live in an &quot;institution.&quot;\n\nThe story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which, in the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case. &quot;Desmond Doyle&quot; (Pierce Brosnan) is the loving father whose wife runs off one day with another man, leaving him with three little kids and little visible means of support. Since he didn&apos;t have enough finances, the government makes the kids wards of the state and places them in Catholic schools-homes (institutions?).\n\nOn that Catholic, or &quot;religious,&quot; angle, you get a lot of positive and negative scenes here. You have a bad, nasty almost sadistic nun &quot;Sister Brigid,&quot; but the others are fine caring ladies, as they should be. Overall, however, you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film and it&apos;s mostly good. Of course, that faith was more out in the open in the &apos;50s than today, but it was inspiring to see in many parts.\n\nBrosnan is excellent in the lead role, a man everyone can identify with: a loving but flawed man. He drinks too much, he swears, he doesn&apos;t have a steady job but he has great heart and has great determination to the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him in this story. I think it&apos;s the best role he has ever played, far better than his superficial James Bond or thieves roles he normally plays.But nobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur), one of Doyle&apos;s three kids and the one that is focused upon here. (The two little brothers are not given much screen time, for some reason.) Brosnan&apos;s allies in here - the two lawyers (played by Stephen Rea and Aiden Quinn) are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a rugged ex-barrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had the best role for the supporting actors.\n\nThis is such an involving story, one that you really care about the people, it can bring a tear or two in the end, but what&apos;s wrong with that? When you are finished watching this film, you feel good.",

For everyone else, this little bit of film magic is a quintessential period piece from the decade of decadence. It&apos;s worth seeing for anyone who appreciates movies that perfectly represent the time in which they were made (a la &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; to the late 70&apos;s, or &quot;Singles&quot; to the early 90&apos;s) San Francisco residents take note of the special cameos from old KJY DJs at the end of the film. The soundtrack is just as poppy and fun as the movie, including rare new wave gems from Culture Club, Human League, Jeff Lynne, Heaven 17 and more. The &quot;dream sequence&quot; in the middle of the film is still suprisingly moving to me. In spite of the hokey plot and computer animation that is downright archaic by todays standards, they don&apos;t really make em like this anymore. Catch it while you can."

This time it&apos;s not just raw hunt for sex, naked girls... This time, film make you think about life, love, and even band camp. You could hate band camp from previous parts, but after watching this movie, you will love it! I think that American Pie 4 is not necessarily the most funniest from the series, but is the most rational one. Also music is awesome, songs like Aeroplane, which melody you will love. This movie could exactly as lost fans for American pie as attract new ones. As I said, it&apos;s just different."

A more hard hitting and gritty boxing drama you might find hard to find, the film really exposes the seedy under belly of the sport with all its corruption and vices. Its often been mooted that Bogart&apos;s last screen role was possibly his best and I can see why, there is a depth in his character that was not always there in some of his roles, Steiger too is phenomenal as in fact are the whole cast. Robson&apos;s direction is always assured and the pacing is nigh on perfect. A word too for Burnett Guffey&apos;s cinematography which captures the wonderful locations and fight scenes beautifully.A Swan song that delivers a fitting end for a legend.",

The reason I&apos;m rating it so low is that it is ridiculous that the animal slaughters were done using live animals, (7 animals were killed in the making of this video, though only 6 are shown) which was completely unnecessary as they clearly had the skills to depict realistic murder/slaughter/rape/gore scenes as shown by all the gruesome events featuring humans. The only good thing to come out of this is that very few movies afterwards ever used real animals becausr of all the backlash this one received.",

      "reviewBody": "**SPOILERS** Romico doing sketches of scenery around town gets the attention of a gang of bikers who feel that their privacy had been invaded. The bikers then take it upon themselves to break the artists hands for doing it. You wonder just what&apos;s the big deal since the bikers, lead by this spaced out lunatic Keeg, are really doing nothing illegal at the time and can easily be photographed by dozens of people, including the police themselves who must have a number of their mug shots. \n\nThe bikers getting Romico alone in his apartment house has Keeg slicing him in the stomach with a straight edge razor. Thats to teach Romico a lesson and keep him from drawing them but that just gets Romico, after he recovers, angrier. It turns out that Keeg and his gang are out on the streets picking up and recruiting young girls for this big-time Las Vages pimp that they work for.\n\nThe thought that Romico&apos;s drawings of Keeg and his boys, and girls, will alert the local vice squad to his actions are as ridicules as Keeg himself. Since the Vice Squad headed by Det. Scott Bardy have been on to him for some time and must have an album of photos of his and his gang. The only reason you can gather for his unbalanced and bazaar actions is that he&apos;s suffering from some kind of paranoia from all the drugs and booze he&apos;s been taking and drinking. \n\nRomico injury meanwhile is being taken care of by this quack doctor and Lea who later turns out to be a spy for Keeg. The doctor gets Romico out of his apartment and into Lea&apos;s place where Romioc is given a bowl of hot soup and some close and warm attention from Lea has Keeg&apos;s bikers break into Romico&apos;s pad and steal his drawings. With Romico finding out that his place had been ransacked by the bikers and that his prize sword, who&apos;s significances is never explained to the audience, stolen he immediately goes to their hideout and beats up two of the bikers thus getting his sword back from them and leaving the place in shambles. This makes Keeg even more determined to do in Romico and then plans to kidnap him and break his hands so he&apos;ll never draw again. \n\nWe also have this little episode in the movie where Keeg and his bikers rob this guy of his motorcycle in broad daylight at a local park beating him unconscious. All this seemed to be put in just to show how wild and crazy he and his boys. The scene had really nothing to do with either Romico Lea or later Janie, who was inducted into Keegs club and then gang raped and shot up with drugs and acid. \n\nIt was Janie who wanted to join Keeg&apos;s gang, and then turned into a hooker and junkie by doing it, that eventually brought him down by almost dropping dead in the park. Janie tells the vice squad at the hospital what Keeg and his gang did, this gives the police the proof that they need to bust him and him gang. \n\nKeeg meanwhile had Romico kidnapped and brought to his hideout where his hands were about to be crushed in a vice. It&apos;s then that Lea changes her mind about betraying Romico and comes to his rescue freeing him by pulling a gun out on Keeg &amp; Co. and having Romico released.\n\nThe cops now on their way to the bikers hideout, after being told by Janie where it was, has Keegs about to take off but his biker moll Sandy is now afraid that he&apos;s leaving her. Keeg told Sandy Earlie that she doesn&apos;t have what it takes to be a member of his &quot;exclusive&quot; organization.\n\nSandy grabbing Lea&apos;s gun and shooting wildly alerts the cops and has Keeg running for his life as all the other bikers scatter like a bunch of cockroaches when you turn the lights on. Onside Sandy who couldn&apos;t hit Keeg at point blank range in the clubhouse shoots wildly at the motorcycle fleeing Keeg from some 100 feet away, the gun actually jerks upwards before it goes off,and amazingly Sandy hits Keeg square on target killing him instantly. The movie ends with Sandy crying and holding the dying Keeg in her arms as the scene turns, or morphs, into one of Romico&apos;s drawings. \n\nMore like a home movie then anything else with Bruce Dern as Keeg doing a good job looking like he&apos;s strung out on drugs. Chris Robinson as the sensitive and courageous artist Rominco looks as if he&apos;s sorry that he&apos;s in the movie and trying to keep a straight face in all the scenes he&apos;s in. Even when his hands are being screwed into a vice Robinson is so unconcerned to what&apos;s happening to him that he looks like his mind, or concentration, is anywhere but in the scene that he&apos;s in!",

The closest what I have seen to the original is the Bengali version, of 1969, starring the legendary Soumitra in the lead role, with Mousumi as Lalita. If one gets a chance, one should watch that, just to compare. The sweetness of the story is lost in this version, which the 1969 retained. That was surprising, considering the director, Bimal Roy, was Bengali as was the producer/ hero, Ashok. Probably the over dramatisation was done to cater to the &apos;audience&apos; and that spoiled the taste, quite a bit. Of course I won&apos;t say the 1969 version too did total justice to the original novel, especially with regards to the Male role (of Shekhar), who was weak. But still one would not notice that aberration, unless one has read the novel. The difference was masked by creating circumstances, so that it was not necessary to be weak.",

      "name": "Entertaining and suspenseful thriller about terrible experiments carried out by Joseph Menguele",
      "reviewBody": "Based on Ira Levin (Rosemary&apos;s baby)&apos;s readable novel , this is an exciting thriller about The Doctor &quot;Joseph Méngüele&quot;, (Gregory Peck), known member of the Nazi party German, and cruel medic of the concentration camp of Auschwitz . He escaped and pursued by the Mossad took refuge in Paraguay and Brazil after the fall of the Third Reich. There in South America get together a group of young people, militants of the Third Reich, to work in a strange issue in which he can proceed their repugnant experiments. Menguele attempts to reconstitute the Nazi movement from his Brazilian sanctuary cloning of boys&apos; genes . A young American, &quot;Barry Kohler&quot; (Steven Guttemberg), contact with the Nazi hunter &quot;Ezra Liebermann&quot; ,( a Simon Wiesental-alike ,magnificently played by Laurence Olivier) , helped by his sister (Lilli Palmer), who begin to investigate and discover the horrible plan of &quot;Méngüele . \n\nThe storyline based on genetic engineering resulted to be revolutionary for its day , so it was a mythical picture in its time, and had too much impact , his importance lies mostly in its scientist approach . At that time cloning was on initial developing and Ira Levin was the first author who wrote about this sensational and dangerous scientific discovery , almost science-fiction with moral dilemma included. The screenplay by Heywood Gould takes many licenses and is less developed than the successful novel of Ira Levin, but gets certain tension and amusement . ¨The Boys From Brazil&quot; is a suspense movie that amuses and entertains , has good taste and in general lines is above average . Story is not boring , neither tiring but is entertaining at any time, though it is true that turns into a picture that tends to underline its latent absurdities and entangled in his ending . In the picture appears some of the best actors of all time, the three principals as Laurence Olivier, James Mason and an awesome Gregory Peck who however overacting in some scenes . Good supporting cast full of fine players usual in Nazis roles as Walter Gotell , Joachin Hansen ,Wofgang Preiss, Gunter Meisner and Uta Hagen as brutal concentration camp chief. Plus prestigious veteran actors as John Dehner , Michael Gough , Bruno Ganz and Denholm Elliott , among others. Special mention to unpleasant ,repulsive boy , well interpreted by Jeremy Black. The soundtrack by the classic musician Jerry Goldsmith, is the most part of time lively and nicely like is heard at the beginning and the end of the movie , nevertheless in some moments he composes strangely, perhaps attempting to remind Puccini and other musicians so admired by Mengele, but conveys us a mirth that it is not fitting to the plot. Furthermore , it packs magnificent and colorful visuals by French cameraman Henry Decae .\n\nFranklin J. Schaffner directed excellent motion pictures as &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Patton,&quot; &quot;Papillon&quot;, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, after the flop of his film titled &quot; Islands in the Stream &quot;, in which went on to coincide with the actor of &quot;Patton,&quot; George C. Scott, decided to embark on a project more commercial and successful as &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Few Notes on Our Food Problem&quot; discusses the issue of how to feed a growing world population. Watching it half a century later, we can discuss other things related to food. One thing to understand is that there&apos;s enough food, but the wealthy hoard it, and a large amount of it goes to waste. In &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;, Barack Obama noted that his then-pastor Jeremiah Wright pointed this out.*\n\nBut even beyond that, using chemicals on food makes insects resistant to the chemicals, creating superbugs. People have been growing food for millennia without problems, so why not listen to them?\n\nOtherwise, the Academy Award-nominated documentary is worth seeing as an introduction to food issues that affect people.\n\n*Wright drew controversy for a speech that got replayed on the news. Obama defended the speech, noting the points that Wright was making. Wright fell from grace following a later, meaner speech.",

      "reviewBody": "You could make a strong case for the late John Frankenheimer being the most unappreciated American film director of all time simply by mentioning his two astonishing 1960s movies &apos;The Manchurian Candidate&apos; and &apos;Seconds&apos;. Frankenheimer made many others movies both good and not so good, but these two are amazing pieces of work and rarely get the praise they deserve. &apos;Seconds&apos; is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Intelligent, complex, and extremely depressing. It doesn&apos;t talk down to its audience and perhaps this is the reason why it was a box office flop and is still all but ignored today. Rock Hudson isn&apos;t an actor with much credibility to most film fans but he is brilliant in this film in easily his most powerful and believable performance ever. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent, especially the underrated character actors John Randolph (&apos;Serpico&apos;), Will Geer (TV&apos;s &apos;The Waltons&apos;) and Jeff Corey (&apos;Mickey One&apos;). &apos;Seconds&apos; is a minor masterpiece. A very disturbing story with an unforgettable climax. Highly recommended!"

The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams&apos; subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon&apos;s frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Triple Cross tells the story of professional thief Eddie Chapman who worked as a double agent for the Germans and the British during World War II. He&apos;s charmingly played by Christopher Plummer who was at the height of his career with The Sound of Music on the horizon for him.\n\nChapman was some piece of work and he was only able to accomplish this whole thing by dint of the fact that he was operating on the Channel islands when World War II broke out. By that time he&apos;d eschewed opening safes by cracking combinations, he was using controlled amounts of gelignite in his work.\n\nSent to prison on the Isle of Jersey, Plummer is there when the Germans take over those islands and promptly offers his services to the Nazis. After taking him up on the offer despite the stern objections of Gert Frobe, Plummer gets an assignment back in the United Kingdom. Of course upon landing there he promptly offers his services to the British and they take him up on it as well.\n\nI love to watch Christopher Plummer on screen. He&apos;s so suave and professional in everything he does whether it&apos;s the Duke of Wellington in the film Waterloo, to Baron Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, to even the villainous hypocritical reverend in Dragnet. He&apos;s never anything, but at his best for his audience.\n\nHis handlers at the British and German ends are Trevor Howard and Yul Brynner. Howard is in the stiff upper lip tradition of his country and Brynner provides an air of melancholia for his part. It ends in tragedy for him as he&apos;s part of the bomb plot to kill Hitler in 1944. \n\nBy the way it is just that somehow Plummer was conned biggest of all in the end. To see what I&apos;m talking about by all means catch Triple Cross.",

      "reviewBody": "John Conte is the renegade Prince in hiding with his desert tribesmen, with both a yen for Marilyn Maxwell and an interest in getting back the throne that his Uncle, Douglass Dumbrille, has stolen from him. The first I can understand, but who does he get to aid him in his second objective. Marilyn, stranded showgirl in the desert, and her sidekicks Abbott and Costello. If you&apos;re willing to suspend reality and believe&apos; that anyone looking to pull off a coup d&apos;etat is looking for help from Abbott and Costello, well then sit back and enjoy the fun.\n\nI have to say that the boys are up to their usual monkeyshines and Marilyn Maxwell is inclined to make any self-respecting prince drool, but the real treat is Douglass Dumbrille. Dumbrille was a fine character actor who usually played smooth villains. He&apos;s probably best remembered for being the lawyer trying to cheat Gary Cooper out of his inheritance in Mister Deeds Goes To Town. However there are moments went Dumbrille shows a nice sense of comic timing and plays a very good straight man for Costello. Hypnosis is one of the tricks in Dumbrille&apos;s bag and he hypnotizes the boys, Marilyn Maxwell, and even the whole Jimmy Dorsey band. I guess they like swing music on the desert.\n\nDumbrille played a similar function in The Big Store with the Marx Brothers. He gets right into the clowning with them also.\n\nThere&apos;s a woman who plays one of Dumbrille&apos;s hare girls who looks a lot like Rosie O&apos;Donnell. Naturally at one point the plot calls for Costello to get into drag and disguise himself as her to fool Dumbrille.\n\nGood, funny, Abbott and Costello nonsense. Easily the best of the films they did on that MGM loan out from Universal.",

      "reviewBody": "You really have to be open-minded watching this, because it deals with subject matter that&apos;s so easy for us to condemn without the will to examine. We have a man, Arnold, who is accused of child molestation after porn magazines are found in his possession. We have his son, Jesse, who is accused of being his accessory in the molestations. Jesse says that he was abused by his father at a young age and that he enjoyed the attention. Then Jesse says his lawyer made that up. A man slouched on a couch, inarticulate and seemingly placing himself in a sexual position while being interviewed for the film, gives testimony against the Friedmans that led to 35 criminal counts. Jesse claims he is innocent. Someone is lying.\n\nThis is rich, complex stuff, and the filmmaker doesn&apos;t put his own views into the film. He doesn&apos;t question the interviewees outright -- although he does &quot;catch&quot; one guy, and contrast different remembrances, some of which indict the Friedmans, others that wave away all accusations. The story gets told to us largely through Arnold&apos;s home videos, and so we&apos;re witness to the family&apos;s self-destruction. This is Shakespeare, and there&apos;s a shattering moment when Arnold&apos;s wife, Elaine, asks, &quot;Where did this come from?&quot;\n\nThe film is craftily put-together -- there&apos;s a shock left until the end, the kind of thing that calls into question what we&apos;ve just seen -- and the filmmaker looks at the situation as a family drama, with the backdrop of the trial, where understandably furious parents try and attack Arnold (&quot;You raped my son!&quot;). But the film also has this sense of sleaze -- or, at least, the sense of something iffy: the sex is inherently &quot;dirty&quot; -- Arnold bought gay-related magazines, and the film has mentions of incest. There&apos;s a kind of public hysteria that exists, where people throw their hands up into the air when anything deviating from the sexual norm is mentioned, and refuse to even listen to an argument that suggests there might not actually be anything wrong. But I think it&apos;s important to stand back and analyze the situation before we make our decision about Arnold. He does, in fact, eventually admit to abusing one child, a son of a friend, so he is a molester; whether or not he abused the children that he taught and that is the subject of the documentary is another matter; my own feeling is that the evidence is pretty sketchy, and that he was made an example out of for possessing magazines. (And he does openly admit to having experimented sexually with his brother -- whose admission at the end of the film is revelatory -- and his lawyer says that Arnold expressed arousal at one young boy bouncing on his father&apos;s lap when the lawyer visited Arnold in jail.) It&apos;s my belief that there&apos;s nothing wrong with Arnold&apos;s pedophiliac desire and owning of child pornography. (Although obviously the purchasing of pornography fuels the industry which in turn exploits and abuses more children, but I&apos;m talking specifically about his mental state.) If he didn&apos;t act on his desires, then he does not deserve to have his life and his family&apos;s life torn to shreds. \n\nAs the film goes on, it becomes clear that Arnold, this somewhat meek, nebbish figure, probably isn&apos;t the monster he&apos;s made out to be. One student made claims against him, we learn, to &quot;get them off my back,&quot; meaning the investigators. That claim led to 16 criminal counts. Some of the charges against Arnold sound horrific, but are pretty unbelievable, like the idea he lined the children up naked in a leap frog position, and then proceeded to penetrate them one by one. (The simple mechanics of male-male intercourse don&apos;t make it that easy.) The police claimed that Arnold had stacks upon stacks of child (or, really, adolescent teen) pornography; yet his wife never managed to see them, and the photos of the house taken during the investigation show nothing. These are the reasons that prove Arnold&apos;s innocence, not the comments made, like the one by Jesse&apos;s friend, who says that he couldn&apos;t be a violent molester because he was so quiet in everyday life. (We all know how wrong-headed that idea is.) This is a terrific documentary; the investigation and the children&apos;s memories all swirling together, but what makes it so crushing is how it affects the family. The looks and the words and the shadows of doubt they cast on one another is far worse than any jail sentence. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "This film won an award at the Venice Film Festival of 1940 - but it would, wouldn&apos;t it?  The story of a great victory for Franco&apos;s side in the Spanish crusade against bolshevism, filmed in Rome by a fascist studio, it could hardly fail to pick up fascist plaudits.\n\nA curious hybrid of a project, this Italian movie of a real-life Spanish event was shot at Cinecitta and on location in Toledo, and stars both Italian and Spanish actors.  The Italian title &quot;L&apos;Assedio dell&apos;Alcazar&quot; (The Siege of the Alcazar)lacks the resonance of the Spanish &quot;Sin Novedad en el Alcazar&quot; (No News in the Alcazar), for reasons that will become apparent. I watched a rather poor-quality print (the only surviving one?) with lots of jumps and scratches, and highly-obtrusive end-of-reel marks.  The editor&apos;s handmade signs, bold crosses and lines, are clearly visible in places.\n\nToledo is a town steeped in history.  Remnants of its great past are everywhere, including the steep, narrow streets bequeathed by the arabs, and the great alcazar (fortress) which dominates the compact city crowded into a loop of the River Tajo.  For Spaniards, the Alcazar resounds with historical significance.  It is, first of all, the ancient arab stronghold which was conquered by Spain&apos;s christian heroes in the middle ages, and therefore stands as a symbol of Spain herself.  In addition, the Alcazar was wholly remodelled by the Emperor Charles V at the apogee of Spain&apos;s Golden Age, the brief century which marked Toledo&apos;s own greatness.  The four cupolas of the Alcazar evoke for all Spaniards the very image of Castile&apos;s heyday. Finally, the Alcazar was reduced to rubble in the violent cataclysm of 1936, to be rebuilt brick by brick by Leftist prisoners, a potent symbol of a nation brought to ruin by civil war, only to rise again.\n\nSome of the episodes of the Siege depicted in the film are unintentionally comical, and some are plainly historically inaccurate.  It is easy to see why the Carmen/Captain/Pedro love triangle was introduced. The audience needs to latch onto recognizable individuals if the larger story is not to seem impersonal, but this crude love story is irrelevant and a waste of narrative space.  No doubt the stirring patriotic song is a turn-on for franquistas, but the addition of choral harmonies and brass accompaniment destroy its credibility.  A derechista plane drops a crate of supplies without a parachute, but the crate somehow effects a soft landing in the courtyard without the slightest forward impetus.  Leftist envoys are led into the Alcazar and through a crowd of womenfolk in blatant disregard of historical fact.  The women and children of the Alcazar were housed in the cellars, well away from bolshevik negotiators.  Carmen may be half-dead from hunger and thirst, but her privations in no way diminish the gloss of her perfect cupid&apos;s-bow lipstick.  The relief column did not reach the Alcazar by strolling over the hills like a bunch of mushroom-pickers.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the sequences are very well done. Italian artistic director Primo Zeglio is mindful of Toledo&apos;s auspicious past, his establishing shots presenting the city like an El Greco canvas, its roofs nestling into the curve of the Tajo with the Alcazar proud on the skyline.  The bustle of the women and children moving into the cellars is excellent, evoking both the sense of emergency and the fortitude with which it is being faced.  Epic-scale set pieces are handled confidently.  The first air-raid combines impressive shots of a panicking crowd with realistic-looking explosions.  The fusillade scenes are really quite beautiful, and the night-time shots are very good, both the sorties and the quiet, contemplative scenes in the cellars.  Chiaroscuro lighting picks out Carmen (played by French actress Mireille Balin), sleepless and radiant with sexual energy.\n\nSiege films have to be careful to avoid monotony, so in &apos;Sin Novedad&apos; we get a variety of emotional tones.  The elation of the successful wheat raid (&quot;Muchachos!  Es trigo!  Es trigo!&quot;) and the news of the advance from Badajoz are exhilarating high points.  In contrast, the religious scenes (the adoration of the Virgin of the Alcazar, the last communion of the dying men) are deeply solemn moments - though viewers unsympathetic to Spanish catholicism may not enjoy them.\n\nSimilarly, the birth of the baby (several children were born during the 41-day siege) is given an un-subtle Madonna and Child symbolic treatment which some viewers might find excessively sentimental.  The mother is even called Maria.  Just in passing, why is the baby wrapped in that bizarre way?\n\nThe lovely scenes of the Toledan countryside and the town&apos;s picturesque streets are all-too-brief, forming little more than a fleeting backdrop to the great exodus.  The hand to hand fighting of the Reds&apos; last offensive is brilliantly done, as is the destruction of the once-beautiful Covarrubias courtyard.  If not quite historically precise, the pulling down of the red flag and the hoisting of the royal standard has a symbolic and cinematic impact that cannot be denied.\n\nThough the film claims to honour all who died, irrespective of allegiance, this is plainly a hollow boast.  Rightists are all shown as saintly (take for example the sacred, sexless union of Antonio and Conchita), and Reds are depicted as cruel,drunken rapists."

It is entertaining and Richard Fransworth is excellent as always and Linda Blair turns in a rather appealing performance capturing the right balance between being lonely yet madly in love. This is one of her better vechiles, but other then Fransworth&apos;s and Blair&apos;s good turns there really isn&apos;t anything special or praticully distinguishable about this film."

      "reviewBody": "Brad Peyton seems to be another one of these directors that Hollywood keeps throwing money at for mediocre formulaic movies, almost certainly written with AI now, trading on big star names &amp; flashy soulless CGI. Jennifer Lopez is still just an average actor I hate to say, propped up by better actors around her. Using AI as a plot device has already been done so much better in movies since the 80&apos;s, but is now mostly just boring. It&apos;s easy to see all the movies Peyton is trying to pay homage to, but it&apos;s usually in the laziest way possible. The excessive time of Lopez alone in her mech suit, clearly just hours of her, green screen, &amp; the director trying to come up with remotely interesting dialogue, is truly a test of endurance to watch. This movie will be forgotten within months.",

      "reviewBody": "This film reaffirms why documentary film making is so important. Documentaries don&apos;t simply tell a story; they tell a real story, a human story. Documentaries help to shed light on human triumphs and human tragedies, both of which are evident in this gripping film directed by Peter Raymont.\n\nThe tragedy, of course, was that nearly 1 million Rwandans were killed and slaughtered in a senseless act of genocide. What adds to the tragedy is that the &quot;civilized&quot; world could have easily stopped this from happening, if they only cared. The film displays how the U.N. and individual countries alike not only failed to help the innocent Rwandan people, but in many ways they contributed to the genocide that happened by creating some of the ethnic stigmas that existed in the country.\n\nYet amongst all of this carnage and horror there did remain some good people who tried to help the Rwandan&apos;s. General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the UN forces in Rwanda, was one of these people. Perhaps no one else in Rwanda did as much to save people as did Mr. Dallaire. Even though he was betrayed by the UN and ignored by the rest of the world, he emerged from this terrible situation as a hero.\n\nI believe the ultimate message of this film is that the leading countries of the world and their citizens must learn from human tragedies like Rwanda so that we can take action to prevent such atrocities from happening again. Unfourtunately, with situations such as the one in Darfur, it seems like this message is not being heard. An important film that must be seen by all and a shining example of documentary film making. 10/10.",

Past-and-present collage isn&apos;t given a very pointed treatment (once the narrative has gone a certain distance, a flashback dating back even further in time drains the immediacy out of the proceedings), though the design of the picture and the personalities involved are very colorful, as is the soundtrack, a mix of newly written tunes and classics. The U.K. truly got a colorful slice of the glam-rock era (as opposed to the U.S., which pretty much missed the boat--and the musical point), and the film, mostly set in England, nails that distinctive time and place with embracing accuracy. Haynes is also shrewd enough to remember the particular talents impersonated here were not the originators of the scene--that all musical trends date back, and nothing is ever truly original or lasts forever. The cast is uniformly excellent: sexy, decadent, kinetic, nervy. Haynes isn&apos;t a master of the outré (like, say, Ken Russell), but neither is he a junky or disrespectful filmmaker, and even in the lowest moments of their lives, this crazy collection of hedonists still look and sound pretty great. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "The Way Of The Dragon had the potential to be Bruce&apos;s best film in my opinion but was bogged down by the dubbing and acting. But it still stands solid as one great Bruce Lee film and boasts the greatest fight scene ever in my opinion. Bruce plays Tang Lung who travels to Rome to help his family battle local gangsters who are trying to take over their resturaunt. Bruce almost plays a Charlie Chaplin type role here which would later be more fitting to Jackie Chan&apos;s slapstick style. Much like the Big Boss the first Bruce fight scene is way into the film but in my opinion this good because it creates a good build up, the nunchuka scene is second only to the one in Fist Of Fury or the uncut Game Of Death. The fight scene in the Roman Colliseum deserves the credit it gets because of one simple reason, its a simple fight, there are no gimmicks, sure its set in the colliseum and the fight is supposed to reflect two roman gladiators but there are no weapons and no sweet talk.  It truly has epic scale. The thing that also makes this fight scene work is the end when Tang Lung out of respect covers Colt with his Karate jacket. There may have been better fights since on screen and I havn&apos;t seen many Hong Kong films with Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen etc but this is the first great one on one fight, therefore it set the standard.\n\nThere will indeed never be another Bruce Lee. I find it fascinating to imagine what Bruce would have done if he had lived, the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s would have been very different if Arnie, Stallone, Wiilis, Seagal and Van Damme had Bruce to compete with, Bruce is sometimes critcised for being a bad actor, but i disagree, if anyone has seen his episodes of `Longstreet&apos; or `Marlowe&apos; they will see that Bruce could convincingly carry a dramatic scene given the right script and no dubbing and he oozed charisma, and he showed glimpses of good acting in Enter The Dragon.\n\nBeing a Bruce fan i kind of wish that Jet Li would do the films that bruce did or was planning on doing, Jet&apos;s early work in Honk Kong like the Shaolin Temple or more recent stuff like Fist Of Legend(remake of Fist Of Fury) and Once Upon A Time In China was very promising and it seemed he was the successor to Bruce but instead now he&apos;s doing crap in Hollywood with DMX and Jason Statham. Strangely the mediocre Lethal Weapon 4 is Jet&apos;s best Hollywood film, Maybe Jet should do a project with John Woo, it would be interesting and they&apos;d probably get the best out of each other."

Of course, the police have the names and addresses of all the paper&apos;s readers, and are also busy organizing for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Paris, many of whom are forced to sell their cherished paintings for near nothing, which are then auctioned off to eager buyers. The auctions are formal affairs, dressed up to legitimize the robbery that took place. At the same time, Delon&apos;s curiosity about this other man with his name and appearance (Robert Klein) becomes an investigation for him to prove his own identity and roots. In the midst of it all is a brilliantly and subtly portrayed decay of society, especially in a memorably filmed anti-semitic cabaret scene, where German officers mingle with the French upper middle-class, laughing along to an incredibly insulting act.",

That&apos;s because the actor who played him clashed with his bosses and opted out but those producers took the nympho sequence of Lemon Popsicle, shown as a home movie here, in order to basically still include him. Sagall sued when he found out. Oh, and during that sequence when Benji is watching with Huey and Froggy (Avi Hadash) who&apos;s usually addressed as either Victor or Foyodor in the Hebrew version and their dates, Benji uses a popcorn bag in the same way as a certain &quot;SNL&quot; sketch involving Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake! Also on board is the sergeant from Private Popsicle (Yosef Shiloach) and the dental assistant from Baby Love (Bea Fiedler), this time as a countess. I&apos;ll just now say this was still quite funny with some touching romance (concerning Benji&apos;s crush on the ship captain&apos;s daughter, Donna) so that&apos;s a recommendation of Up Your Anchor.",

The movie gets off to a slow start, but starts to work about a quarter into the film. The story unfolds at a slow pace; fitting for its locale. The character development for the three main characters (Travolta, Johansson and Macht) is well-woven into the story. Each character is flawed and through a series of events overcomes their problem. That to me is interesting movie-making. No storyline or subplot was left hanging at the end. Maybe I was tired, but I didn&apos;t see the end of the movie coming in the first five minutes as one comment stated. This movie is worth your time.",

      "name": "Funny and entertaining film with attractive premise : male FBI agent impersonates the elderly grandmother of a suspect",
      "reviewBody": "The film talks about the FBI agent Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) , he&apos;s assigned to catch a ruthless bank robber and a recent prison escapee (Terrence Howard) . He suspect will be coming down to visit his ex-fiancee Sherry (Nia Long) and her child . The cop along with his colleague John (Paul Giamatti) set up a stakeout across from the home , and Turner posing as a woman , in order to investigate a case , who&apos;s known as a southern sweet ¨big momma¨, she is a severely overweight but bright old woman . This time he goes undercover , attempting to solve a case , and he becomes invoved with an unhappy mother , and his son . Disquising as a foul-mouthed Big Momma he must find the murderer before he finds them , along the way he has a lot of problems. It ain&apos;t over &apos;til the fat lady sings! This FBI agent is going undercover... and he&apos;s concealing more than a weapon.He&apos;s Deep Undercover. On June 2nd he&apos;s deep undercover.\n\nThis diverting movie expands from an original idea about woman&apos;s disguising , but Lawrence and the writers manage to pull it off rather impressively . The jokes are plentiful and is pretty entertaining , the plot doesn&apos;t allow for many quiet moments which Lawrence needs to balance out the slapdash . There are sporadic laughters , though too often humour is mined by scatological and toilet lines , but in this movie some gags are agreeable enough . It&apos;s a farce with the great master of disguise Lawrence when he takes a make up by make-up artist Greg Cannon and is transformed into fat grandma . The story is fun and interesting and the characters are genuine and sympathetic . Film is a Martin Lawrence recital , using a few tricks of disguise , carrying out complete transformations , as he makes acrobatics , stooges , tongue-twister and pull faces and grimaces . The picture is a vehicle Lawrence , he&apos;s a real show man and authentic farceur by impersonating the cantankerous Southern granny . Lawrence like his partner Eddie Murphy has plenty of experience with women costumes and various roles . He is well accompanied by a good cast mostly African-Americans , such as : Cedric the Entertainer , Octavia Spencer , Phyllis Applegate , Anthony Anderson , Philip Tan , Edwin Hodge , Aldis Hodge , among others . The film gets a nice cinematography by Michael O&apos;Shea , and atmospheric score by Richard Gibbs . The motion picture was allrightly directed by Raja Gosnell (&quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, &quot;Home Alone 3&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;&quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot; , &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;, ¨Smurfs¨ , ¨Smurfs¨) but he had nothing to do with the sequels , but the film cemented his reputation as a commercially successful director . If you like Lawrence&apos;s crazy acting , you&apos;ll enjoy this one.\n\nThe film ¨Big Momma&apos;s House¨ (2000) was an unexpected box office hit , earning about 174 million at the worldwide box office, and received two sequels of its own . Being followed by ¨Big Momma&apos;s House II¨ 2006 by John Whitesell , with Emily Procter , Mark Moses , Zachary Levi , Kat Dennings , Chloë Grace Moretz , Marisol Nichols and again a Martin Lawrence providing a recital in a sequel more amusing than previous film . And a third part in which Momma&apos;s got back-up , titled ¨Big mommas : Like fater like son¨ 2011 by John Whitesell with Martin Lawrence, Brandon T. Jackson, Jessica Lucas.",

      "name": "Hugely disappointing compared to the classic TV show, and is hugely problematic as a standalone film",
      "reviewBody": "While it had a bit of a slow start, with technical limitations being obvious and the characters not being as interesting, from the moment it switched to colour and introduced its most iconic character Barnabas Collins (unforgettably played by Jonathan Frid) the 1966 &apos;Dark Shadows&apos; is a classic.\n\nIt is easy to see why it was so popular back in its day, and it is equally easy to see why it is remembered so fondly now. Despite its flaws (which were forgivable in a way), this reviewer spent many days and hours watching it with sheer joy, it really helping me get through many stressful and mentally straining times this year at music college (though there were many great times too, and saw a huge progression and several seemingly impossible achievements).\n\nSadly, this 2012 film version of &apos;Dark Shadows&apos; was hugely disappointing. As an adaptation of the show, it just doesn&apos;t compare and understandably can (and has been) be seen as a travesty to die-hard fans. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp apparently claim to be fans of &apos;Dark Shadows&apos;, but to me that wasn&apos;t obvious at all. There was more of a sense that Burton hadn&apos;t even seen the show, seeing as the tone and spirit feels completely wrong, or he thought he could improve upon it.\n\nOn its own as a film, it has its good points but several major flaws that to be honest for this reviewer were more obvious. It is a shame as I am a fan of Burton&apos;s 80s and 90s stuff, especially &apos;Edward Scissorhands&apos; and &apos;Ed Wood&apos; which are two of my all-time favourites, but after his career low-point &apos;Planet of the Apes&apos; he became hit-and-miss. While it is better than &apos;Planet of the Apes&apos;, along with &apos;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&apos; and &apos;Alice in Wonderland&apos; &apos;Dark Shadows&apos; is very much a lesser effort from Burton.\n\nThere are good things. It does look great, with splendidly Gothic and vibrantly colourful sets, wonderful and atmospheric use of colours, effectively ghoulish make-up and appropriately kooky costumes that suited the characters very well, while it&apos;s beautifully and stylishly photographed as well. The music score is groovy, rousingly orchestrated, haunting and a long way from forgettable or generic, if not one of Danny Elfman&apos;s best or most inspired scores, with some clever song choices. There are some amusing, well-written lines in the script, loved the line about Alice Cooper and it is most successful when Barnabas is struggling to fit in, and a few of the cast acquit themselves well.\n\nJohnny Depp is no Jonathan Frid and he has given better performances (though also much worse, it is one of his better performances in any of his later collaborations with Burton), but he is clearly having a lot of fun as Barnabas without overdoing it and is one of the most involved members of the cast, he also is very charismatic. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most successful at injecting a genuine and faithful personality, while Eva Green is both sexy and intense. Cameos by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper are well-utilised.\n\nUnfortunately, a number of the cast don&apos;t come off well. Jackie Earl Haley, who is very good at being menacing and sometimes low-key if he needs to be, looked bored in a role that is so much in the background that there was almost no need for him. Helena Bonham Carter overdoes it and comes over as out of place, while Chloe Grace Moretz is irritating in a negatively stereotypical role. Much of the acting is either over-compensated and bland, being able to do very little to nothing with their dull and often unrecognisable in personality characters, and while it was interesting to see Frid his appearance is far too short to leave a lasting impression. The chemistry between the characters, one of the show&apos;s biggest strengths, is barely there.\n\n&apos;Dark Shadows&apos; script has its moments, but these moments are too sporadic. Tonally it is very unfocused and muddled too often, it rarely seems to know whether to be eccentric comedy or full-blown melodrama. It attempts to do both (amongst others) and never completely succeeds at either, the comedy is too sporadic and can be childish and overdone and the melodrama is unmoving and overwrought. Story-wise it&apos;s a mess, it never really comes to life, has twists that come out of nowhere and are completely misplaced (especially the werewolf subplot), parts that drag endlessly and contribute very little to the plot and parts that looked alright on paper but executed in a half-baked way.\n\nAs a result, the Gothic atmosphere is almost completely lost, with it only being obvious in the production values, while the sex scene choreographed to Barry White is too broad and overly-wild and the ending is overblown to ridiculous extremes. Burton&apos;s direction does well with the style is but severely lacking in the story and the substance, where there is a complete lack of heart and soul.\n\nOverall, not awful but disappoints hugely both as a standalone and especially as an adaptation of a classic show. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

In a sense it combines the depth of European (Russian) movies with power and speed of Hollywood. For example compare the scene of break up of Lesha and Rita with the drugs deal in the airport which is made in the best traditions of Tarantino. All in all good movie worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "This version of David COPPERFIELD is quite a good one, in that it does trim the 800 plus page novel down to reasonable coherence. There are some characters that one misses, but they are understandably cut due to length considerations. While Steerforth and his betrayal of the Peggoty Family is in the film (including the dual tragedy at it&apos;s conclusion), the sub-story of Little Em&apos;ly&apos;s friend Martha and the business regarding Steerforth&apos;s mother, Rosa Dartle, and Mrs. Mowcher were dumped (Mrs. Mowcher would have been hard to cast). Pity, Mrs. Mowcher&apos;s famous speech to David about not confusing her physical attributes with her mental ones is missing. Also Steerforth&apos;s butler Littimer appears once, but the film does not get into the ironic coda of his imprisonment. While Uriah Heep&apos;s villainy against Mr. Wickfield and his clients is shown, his willingness to dig up dirt against other &quot;enemies&quot; is not shown. In particular his treatment of Dr. Strong (David&apos;s second schoolmaster), his young wife, and Jack Dalton is not developed (which is sad as it proves Mr. Dick is not simple minded).\n\nBut those are minor points really. The best jobs in the film are the work of the performers under George Cukor&apos;s direction: Edna Mae Oliver as the crusty, wise Aunt Betsy; Roland Young as the evil, greasy Uriah Heep (his best villain part); and W.C.Fields as Wilkins McCawber (Dicken&apos;s tribute to his lovable but improvident father) is superb - the one time his comic personae met the proper dramatic role; and Lionel Barrymore as Dan Pegotty determined to find his lost, ruined niece. Freddy Bartholemew&apos;s performance as young David is wonderful. But I must admit that Frank Lawson is a trifle colorless as the grown up David (although he has a funny moment at a dinner that Dora (Maureen O&apos;Sullivan) tries to prepare). It is a weakness but a small weakness in a nearly perfect film.",

Regardless, it&apos;s still high quality series entertainment and is well worth watching. Unfortunately, in addition to being less &quot;fresh&quot;, the witty dialog also seems a little less witty--I just didn&apos;t laugh as much with this outing as the others--even the later episodes. So the final verdict is that this is a decent but not great entry in the series. If you haven&apos;t seen the first ones, see them first. If you see this one first, the movies might seem just a bit mediocre--bear with it they are wonderfully fun movies.",

They&apos;re a crime family. There is some overacting. There are some odd choices... but by God it is entertaining to behold. It looks like they all have fun with their roles, and I was here for it! Kept me interested throughout. Bond girl, Claudine Auger, is in here for a bit but doesn&apos;t do much.\n\nThe other part I appreciated is Duccio Tessari&apos;s directing. The way he reveals information is intriguing. And the man knows how to film landscapes.",

Imagine a police thriller starring N-sync and you&apos;ll start to get the idea of how bad this film is. Basically the plot follows a cop who is the laughing stock of the force (a stupendously awful performance from Eric Tsang) who recruits three police academy dropouts (Nic Tse, Stephen Fung and Sam Lee) to infiltrate a group of hip n&apos; trendy young Triads. The big question must be how the trio ever got into the academy in the first place since they act like 11-year old schoolboys after their first beer. By the end of the movie they&apos;ve got in with the Triads, had some fights and saved the day, but by that point nobody really cares. The only reason to watch right to the end is (a) a big explosion from the Independence Day effects team and (b) a Jackie Chan cameo.\n\nReally this movie sums up the problem with many modern HK films. It&apos;s too American-style, and puts too much emphasis on pretty-boy hair-farmers with the acting talent and martial arts ability of Mariah Carey. The performances are pitiful. The action scenes are a joke. Only Francis Ng, a criminally underused Daniel Wu and Toru Nakamura as the Triad gang leaders come off with any dignity. And if you think this sounds bad, the sequel, Gen-Y Cops, is a million times worse.\n\n3/10"

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t seen THE ADDICTION in ten years, but I do recommend it from what I remember. And the list of attractive concepts are, envelope please: Lili Taylor, Christopher Walken, Anabella Sciorra, black and white meta-fictional film, and of course vampires galore! Abel Ferrara has directed other well known movies such as Bad Lieutenant, California, and the Funeral. Of these movies, I mildly recommend the first two but definitely not the third. The Funeral is plain boring and dreary, while the other two entertain by showing the gritty side of human nature.\n\nCaution, if you&apos;re the type of vampire fan who must have each actor decked out in fangs and yellow contacts, then steer clear of this movie, since it&apos;s really questionable whether the characters in THE ADDICTION are actually vampires or are just plain junkies in nice clothes.\n\nLastly, there is a very complex philosophical feel to THE ADDICTION, as Lili Taylor muses about life and death in deep conversations in different venues around New York City: a college book store, movie theater, etc. I recommend any philosopher out there to grab THE ADDICTION off the shelves as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaking of the mid-90&apos;s, that short-lived era was a golden age for indie actors like Lili Taylor and Parker Posey. Taylor got a taste of vampire-hood early on in this movie, and fortunately for us, and for the committee, Posey got her fangs in Blade 3, which I was very happy to see happen. I mean, come on, all those party girls are really vampires at heart.\n\nJY\n\nJimboduck-dot-com",

      "reviewBody": "This was Vittorio de Sica&apos;s own favourite among his films, and he always regretted that it was more or less thrown aside, as it was made during the chaotic ending of the war when Italy was thrown into the turmoil of civil war and practically lost in the national confusion, and few copies of the film have survived, mainly only in 16mm format. Hopefully the film will some day be completely restored, as it is an undeniable and indispensable masterpiece, being definitely de Sica&apos;s most compassionate film, compassion pervades the film from the beginning to the end in constantly increasing fervour, and there are many scenes of unforgettably touching if not heartrending poignancy, the boy in the wheelchair and his way of descending the stairs, the passion of the pianist who loses the command of his right hand in the middle of a concert, the old lady with her concern for a family at war in constant harrowing conflict, the merry industrial worker who gets blinded for life, the scenes at the train station and in the train, and the grand finale in the cathedral, actually San Paolo fuori le mura in Rome, borrowed for the purpose of the film and transforming it into an equivalent to Lourdes, it&apos;s a very Catholic film, but compassion dominates everything Catholic here, giving it a universal significance and solemnity of the high communion of a large congregation - there are many actors and actresses here, and they are all indispensable for the whole. The film is a revelation of compassion and perhaps even de Sicat&apos;s most beautiful film.",

I think the best performances were from Oprah and Kimberly Elise.  Beah Richards was exceptionally good in her small role as Baby Suggs.  I have studied slavery in the past, and I knew it was very brutal.  But if you pair this move with &apos;Amistad&apos; you get the real picture of slavery and how horrible it was.  Another good performance came from Lisa Gay Hamilton as younger Sethe, because she exemplified the true spirit of the hopeful slave. I would not recommend to those who have a faint heart or who get squeamish easily."

Don&apos;t get me wrong--this movie is trying and succeeds to a varying degree at capturing a certain style and certain flavor of suspense horror film---the director is quite clearly a fan of early Cronenberg--there&apos;s not just the obvious nod to Scanners but there&apos;s nods to The Brood and Shivers and even a slight one to videodrome in here as well (at least i thought i caught those maybe i&apos;m wrong i don&apos;t know) and there are nods to other scare films of the early 80&apos;s as well--and certainly the whole tone and pace and set design and wardrobe and just everything about it is very much on the money for a suspense film from the early part of that decade--but i don&apos;t know, the movie also had a sort of sleepy effect on me---like as psychedelic as the director wants the movie to be (and it definitely is) you can only indulge in that kind of style so much before you just end up putting a guy like me into a kind of coma--and not the cool trance like one that i&apos;m sure the director was hoping his film would have on its audience. You know there&apos;s only so much ranting and raving i could take from the good psychotic doctor and there&apos;s only so much self defense scenes i could take from the woman in the mental hospital before a part of me just wanted to scream Get on with it already movie! but eventually the movie does--and it does it well enough---but not so well enough that i can&apos;t help but think this movie should have probably been at least a half hour shorter then it was. Ehh whatever---i&apos;m positive it will find its audience soon enough anyways and it will have a nice cult like following in the years to come--much like Cronenberg&apos;s early stuff does too.",

      "reviewBody": "As I watched this film, all I kept thinking about was how selfish everyone in the film was. Anna was the worst culprit and the poor baby inside her stomach was a prisoner of her selfish whims. In the film, we watch as 16 year old Anna chain smokes cigarettes, hear tales of all the drugs she&apos;s done while pregnant, and appears catatonic from whatever chemicals she secretly ingested that day. It is a miracle that the child was even born let alone born healthy. In a broader sense, Anna&apos;s story is one of a changing post-war Italian society that didn&apos;t want to work for their living, was perfectly happy to beg for food, and felt the government had left them out in the cold.\n\nWhen we meet Anna, she is about nine months pregnant. The baby doesn&apos;t seem to exist for her beyond being a nuisance. She tells different stories about who the father is (chances are she has no idea) and seems unaware of what having a baby means. Though filmed on the streets of Rome, Anna is a Sardinian from a small town who left home at a young age and grew up in orphanages and institutions in France. She tells dubious stories about nuns who abused children by smearing spicy mustard on them to prevent them wetting the bed, whipped infants for crying, and forced children who vomited or wet the bed to eat or drink it. As you watch the film, you&apos;ll soon discover that Anna&apos;s stories are often exaggerated and hinge on whether she&apos;s got the attention of the listener, usually Massimo. There is no doubt Anna had a rough upbringing but she has learned how to hustle to survive and uses this skill almost without thinking.\n\nWhen she first enters the scene, Anna has a nasty cough and is clearly malnourished and riddled with filth and possibly disease. Despite her pregnancy, she had been living on the street for months and earning money as a prostitute to support her drug habit. At one point, she discovers she has lice and spreads it to the crew. In one particularly creepy scene, her benefactor Massimo (the 30-something David Crosby lookalike who found her on the street and took her in), orders her to strip and scrubs her body with soap. When she washes her private parts with shampoo, he watches closely and narrates. &quot;Shampoo on your p***y,&quot; he exclaims with delight. Massimo&apos;s intentions toggle between well-meaning sympathy for a human being in need to creepy excitement over his control of a teenage girl who will pretty much do whatever he asks so she can stay in his home, eat his food, and smoke his cigarettes. In exchange, she agrees to allow him and Alberto (director) to film whatever they want of her life. Legal ramifications are briefly mentioned in the film since Anna is legally a minor and cannot consent to what they&apos;re asking of her. In addition, there are several scenes of Anna completely nude including a few where Massimo reacts joyfully to her lactating breasts.\n\nThe film has an extremely bloated runtime clocking in at just under four hours. Most of it is taken up by man on the street interviews with some of Anna&apos;s friends and acquaintances as well as other random people who spend their days debating societal ills. One guy who claims he is Anna&apos;s boyfriend describes her as a b*tch who needs a crack in the face. Very few of them have anything nice to say about Anna, claiming she&apos;s selfish, mean, and addicted. They warn Massimo that she is a freeloader who uses people. In a later scene, they discuss the reasons why they don&apos;t want to work and outrage that society condemns them for having been in and out of jails and institutions. This leads to a sub-plot of the film: universal condemnation of hospitals, institutions, and social welfare agencies. All who have had experience with such places claim that they don&apos;t help the people they are supposed to and look down on those in need. They claim that police target political activists such as themselves and falsely arrest and jail them. Some of those interviewed do seem genuinely interested in politics while others are portrayed as freeloaders and addicts angry at the world for not giving them a handout.\n\nAs the film goes on, Anna begins a relationship with Vincenzo, one of the crew members who seems enchanted by her. She moves in with him and he helps her when she goes into labor. At that point, she completely shuts the film crew out and doesn&apos;t allow them into the hospital. They are outraged at what they deem her selfishness despite their best efforts at helping her. Anna delivers the baby which is subsequently taken from her. She is abusive to hospital staff and eventually escapes from the hospital and leaves the baby with Vincenzo who is stunned that she would leave so suddenly. Nobody ever sees her again.\n\nAnna is a microcosm of street people everywhere. Even in countries with social welfare institutions, lots of homeless people slip through the cracks. The film doesn&apos;t seem to have a message other than to document how these people live and what they deal with. It does not justify its extremely long running time as the political diatribes grow wearisome after the first hour. However, the scenes with Anna are captivating.",

      "reviewBody": "Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way. I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument – and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we &apos;know&apos; or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general&apos;s wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck, you&apos;ve even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.\n\nAs for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law. They didn&apos;t know about the atrocities in the concentration camps. At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich. They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go. If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?). The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied. Anyone who&apos;s lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize.\n\nI&apos;m not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking. How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does – simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way. It&apos;s the best of humanity. How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster&apos;s character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy&apos;s understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end – intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked. Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong. Had the Axis won the war, I don&apos;t know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be. The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it&apos;s representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today – and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",

The idea of seeing a film with Malcolm McDowell in it, and nothing else worth watching in the other channels, played a trick on us. We witnessed in horror, a remake of the Oscar Wilde&apos;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; that has nothing to do with the classic, and much better film, of 1945.\n\nUnder the direction of Allan A. Goldstein, we are taken, where else, to the world of the super models, where beauty is only skin deep. Henry, who stands as the Devil, tempts Louis into giving his soul in exchange of keeping his good looks forever, duh! Incredibly, we watch as the picture of Louis, now renamed Dorian, ages in ways that are not realistic, at all. I mean, a few wrinkles, we could understand, but making the image in the photograph, taken by Henry, a monster, is pushing reality a bit too far.\n\nMalcom McDowell, who is an otherwise excellent actor, lends himself to this misguided attempt to retell something that was better done before and should have been left alone by the people behind this travesty.\n\nWatch it at your own risk.",

In this movie he coyld not have been bettered (Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. included), The starry cast,music,costumes and settings brought vividly to life the Spanish Main,Maracaibo and other Pirate ports of call.With a great family theatrical tradition behind him,Power&apos;s presence enriched every movie he made (what a twist of fate that he died exactly as his father Tyrone Power Sr.did,filming a duel scene -&quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Solomon and Sheba). I believe that Power&apos;s acting ability even today is not fully recognised,simply because the Studio System   restricted   his choice of film.Let anyone hear Power recite the poems of Byron (available on disc) and realise his premature death was a tragedy.&quot;THE BLACK SWAN&quot; could be said to represent a golden period in the history of Hollywood swashbucklers.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film about the immediate aftermath of war from the perspective of the defeated.  A Japanese company exhausted by their retreat through the Burmese jungle learn of their nation&apos;s surrender.  At the request of their allied captors one of their number, Mizushima, agrees to journey to a mountain stronghold where another company is still holding out and engaging in combat.  He tries to persuade his compatriots to lay down their arms and narrowly escapes death when they are massacred after refusing to give in. Appalled by the carnage around him, Mizushima decides not to return to his colleagues or country.  Disguised as a Buddhist monk, he embarks on the task of laying to rest the war dead that would otherwise fall prey to the vultures. There is nothing in the way of plot beyond this.  &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; is that rare thing, a war film that does not rely on action. Rather does it attempt to define the innate dignity of a former aggressor attempting to salvage some sort of meaning through reparation rather than taking the comfortable course that peace can offer.  Ichikawa&apos;s tender tribute to a form of saintliness sometimes totters on the tightrope of sentimentality and oversimplification - did ever weary soldiers sing more beautifully! - but by the end the message overrides all doubts.  We are witnessing a proud expansionist nation coming to terms with collapse and attempting, through the powerful symbol of Mizushima, to expiate its past. Ichikawa made this film towards the end of the golden age of monochrome. that of Welles, Reed, Wyler and Ford.  Like those giants he gives us wonderful closeups.  &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; abounds in evocative images of Burmese villagers, Buddhist monks and Japanese soldier that once seen leave an indelible impression within the mind."

Over ten years later (2023) this film like the album has remained an underrated classic for both of the artists long careers.\n\nIts shot in a making of an album style as you see the album be created from start to finish. Elton John helps lead the way, but this film/album would be nothing without Leon Russell. Leon Russell remains underrated to this day despite he immense legacy and credit work since the 1960s.\n\nIts for sure watching if you want to see someone work with their idol and if you want to see someone (Leon Russell) come back to life after a long retreat from the public spotlight.",

I myself was skeptical, too, whether Periode 1 will reach Schuh des Manitu but I was disappointed positively. Tonight I watched Periode 1 the second time and, like in Schuh des Manitu, I discovered gags I haven&apos;t perceived the first time because there are enough of it in there! Why do most of the commentators put emphasis on the gay-factor? Surely that was the original attention of &quot;Unser Traumschiff&quot; in Bullyparade but in the movie there surely is more! You remember &quot;Men In Tights&quot; (Helden in Strumpfhosen) by Mel Brooks, the Robin Hood-spoof? O.k., there was no gay-topic in it but it was very smug! Enjoy the details! The counselor of &quot;William der Letzte&quot;, the rented spy, the taxi and so on - there&apos;s so much in it you can laugh about! Michael Bully Herbig surely accepts the inheritance of Monthy Pythons and Mel Brooks, in my eyes!\n\nSimply enjoy it like me!"

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t expect a lot from &apos;Beowulf&apos;, for lots of reasons, most of which were to do with the casting: incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what&apos;s now southern Sweden; wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor; loony Crispin Glover as a flesh-rending monster, and weirdest of all, Angelina Jolie as the monster&apos;s mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng, as the poet might have put it. Then there was the way they did the whole thing in CGI, running the risk of making it all look a bit rubbery. Finally, Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable &apos;Forrest Gump&apos;.\n\nNevertheless, this is a lot better than I thought it would be. I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it. This is a &apos;Beowulf&apos; where the story, although different from the poem, is actually very far from shabby.\n\nWithout giving too much away, the main difference from the poem is that in the poem, there is no connection between the monster Grendel and his mother on one hand, and the dragon in the latter half of the poem on the other hand. In the film, a connection exists. Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary do a professional job of tying it all together in a satisfying Hollywood way, without betraying the basic darkness and sadness of the story; it&apos;s not like Beowulf rides off into the sunset with Wiglaf at the end. Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and raw-boned Grendel, whose main problem is that he just can&apos;t stand the sound of people having fun, although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point. Angelina Jolie&apos;s animated self spends all her on screen time walking around without any clothes on, something that apparently gave Jolie a blush when she saw a cut of the movie. (One of the more eerie things about this film is that the cartoon Angelina Jolie looks marginally more realistic than the actress herself.)\n\nDespite an accent that&apos;s more Stockwell than Geatland, Ray Winstone does a fine, sombre job as the hero, although my wife thought that the animated Winstone looked more like Sean Bean. Brendan Gleeson does a splendid job in the niche he&apos;s carved for himself of Hairy Sidekick. The acting honours, or at least the animation honours, go to Robin Wright Penn (or whoever worked on her character) as the pale and melancholy queen; she has moments of subtle hesitation and sadness that struck me as a triumph of CGI acting. \n\nThere is much excellent smiting, some of it unfortunately toned down a little in order to keep a PG-13 rating - so we don&apos;t actually get to see Grendel biting men&apos;s heads off, just people&apos;s reactions to him doing so. Most importantly, the story is not a travesty of the original. It&apos;s thoughtful and interesting, as you&apos;d expect from a writer of Gaiman&apos;s quality (if not from the author of &apos;Killing Zoe&apos;) and contains some striking meditations on the power of legend and reputation. Plus, there&apos;s a really huge kick-ass dragon. &apos;Beowulf&apos; is a strange and unexpected treat.",

Asou Kumiko was absolutely beautiful, and there was just something about her that made this movie very funny.\n\nThere were many scenes that I thought were really stupid, but the movie was so well-directed that I burst out laughing every time, and not only that, the story spontaneously change from comedy to human drama that really touched me. Although family members may not show it at times, deep down... they really care about each other.\n\nThis movie also explores the complexity of human relationships, and how hard it is to get along with everybody.\n\nThe message of this movie is to cherish every moment, because you&apos;ll never know what you&apos;ve lost until it&apos;s too late. Your parents might be embarrassing, and you may think you&apos;re doing something you really hate, but when you think back, they&apos;re all sweet memories.

A number of the filming techniques did an *extremely* effective job of letting us see insides the minds and hearts of both doctors *and* patients.\n\nIn a topic as emotionally charged as what this film covers, it&apos;s easy to get caught up in the subject as &quot;abstract.&quot; This film helps us to see the real impact and effects these people - and practices - have. It&apos;s not always pretty, and it can be very difficult to watch, but I feel significantly more connected to the whole subject now.\n\nYes, the film leans in some ways toward &quot;pro-choice,&quot; but it in fact makes some very clear points about just how difficult that choice is. I won&apos;t spoil it, but the most intense moment of the film for me happened right there. And the film doesn&apos;t vilify the pro-life people - they&apos;re ever-present, as in real life, but they are portrayed honestly as well. It&apos;s clear they are as passionate as the doctors.\n\nThis is just, overall, a very brutally honest film.\n\nI had the good fortune to see this in a small theater, and one of the directors did a video-chat with the theater as a Q &amp; A. That was a nice touch, but my 10/10 review was cinched the moment the film ended.",

I watched it and struggled not to cry- even as a fictional story it would be moving, but the fact that it is real makes it even more poignant. The shots are brilliant too and this makes it one of the best political films I have ever seen. This film will force you to rethink your views on capital punishment."

      "reviewBody": "The Korean movie Oh! Soo-jung was shown in the U.S. with the terrible title, Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (2000). It was written and directed by Sang-soo Hong.\n\nEun-ju Lee stars as Soo-jung, a young woman who is a script-writer for a TV series, produced by Young-soo (played by Moon Sung-keun). Jae-hoon (portrayed by Jeong Bo-seok) is a wealthy art gallery owner. Young-soo hopes to get Jae-hoon to finance a film that he is directing.\n\nSoo-jung is very beautiful, and both men would like to get into bed with her. As the title suggests, she is a virgin, although whether she would like to stay a virgin is never clear.\n\nSang-soo Hong is an interesting director, but you&apos;ll have to decide whether you like his style. The characters talk, smoke, and eat out at what I think are the Korean equivalent of our diners. Scenes start and stop almost at random. Sometimes we see the same scene from a slightly different point of view. The dialog is almost the same, but not quite.\n\nOne scene stops in the middle, and then picks up later in the movie. The movie isn&apos;t preseted in a linear fashion. Sometimes we see flashbacks of how scenes begin after we&apos;ve viewed the scene itself.\n\nThe movie is all about sex, but we don&apos;t actually see much sex. There&apos;s one sex scene that&apos;s hard to watch. It&apos;s consensual--sort of--but it&apos;s about as erotic as the Korean dish kimchi.\n\nWe had seen another film by Sang-soo Hong, Claire&apos;s Camera (2017), and enjoyed it. That was a hit, but this was a miss.\n\nThe movie worked well on the small screen. It&apos;s shot in grim black and white, which is OK. I don&apos;t think it would have been improved by color. The film has an adequate IMDb rating of 7.0. I didn&apos;t think it was quite that good--I gave it a 6.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the classic Grimm Brothers tale, Little Red Riding Hood; Freeway is the disjointed and frankly weird odyssey following a young girl on the way to her grandmother&apos;s home. The film begins much like any other hitchhiking film, with a young girl being picked up by a slightly sinister driver. However, you won&apos;t be able to predict where it&apos;s going to go from there, as Freeway continually puts its characters in absurd situations and delivers the unexpected. The plot doesn&apos;t exactly adhere to the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and after the basics have been laid down, it&apos;s basically anyone&apos;s game right down to the gripping and hilarious climax. The film sees Reese Witherspoon&apos;s juvenile delinquent being picked up by Kiefer Sutherland&apos;s child psychologist after fleeing from her home when her mother and step father are arrested. After telling the psychologist of her relationship with her step father, she soon realises that he&apos;s enjoying what she&apos;s saying a little too much; and it&apos;s not long before she asks him if he&apos;s the infamous I-5 killer, and he doesn&apos;t do anything to convince her he&apos;s not...\n\nFreeway doesn&apos;t introduce any characters that are particularly likable, and all are guilty to a degree. Most audience members will be on the side of Witherspoon&apos;s character, as although she certainly has personality problems, she&apos;s great fun to watch and her twisted logic isn&apos;t usually far from being spot on! Witherspoon got one of her best roles in this film, and really does carry it despite her young age. Kiefer Sutherland stars alongside her, and it&apos;s rather odd seeing him in the psycho role after getting so used to him being Jack Bauer in 24. He does do it great, however. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the pitch black humour that goes hand in hand brilliantly with the absurdity of the piece. The plot is really freewheeling, and the film jumps from road thriller to prison drama to the court room in the blink of an eye, and this helps to ensure that the audience is always kept on their toes. This film won&apos;t appeal to people that don&apos;t like their movies to be pitch black and unpleasant, but anyone who enjoys a good does of absurdity shouldn&apos;t hesitate to track this film down!",

      "reviewBody": "TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS (RKO Radio, 1945), directed by Kurt Neumann, the first theatrical &quot;Tarzan&quot; release since 1943&apos;s TARZAN TRIUMPHS and TARZAN&apos;S DESERT MYSTERY, and the third installment under Sol Lesser productions for RKO starring Johnny Weissmuller, brings forth some notable changes: Tarzan having a bigger waistline and sporting an upgraded larger sized loincloth, while Johnny Sheffield, not quite a teen idol yet, still the curly haired adolescent Boy of about 13 or 14, whose speaking voice no longer in a higher pitch of a child, coming close to the physical height of Weissmuller, sporting a darker colored but smaller sized loincloth. Most importantly, however, is the return of Tarzan&apos;s mate/wife, Jane, formerly played by the redheaded Maureen O&apos;Sullivan at MGM, now enacted by the blonde Brenda Joyce. With Joyce tackling over the part, Boy no longer addresses her as &quot;Mother&quot; but by her first name. After two previous entries bearing World War II related themes and invasion of Nazis, the series returns to basic formula of white hunters on a friendly mission to become dangerous intruders to the Tarzan family when greed of gold is concerned.\n\nAMAZONS opens with Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller), his son, Boy (Johnny Sheffield) and their pet chimpanzee, Cheetah, setting out to meet with Jane, who is scheduled to return home from her trip in England. While rafting down the river, Tarzan rescues a girl from a lion attack. An ankle injury has Tarzan return Athena (Shirley O&apos;Hara), carries her back to the secret city of Amazon woman in Palmeria ruled by a middle-aged queen (Maria Ouspenskaya). As much as Tarzan is the only outsider to know of this kingdom, Boy, who disobeyed Tarzan by remaining behind, secretly observes at a distance. After the reunion with Jane (Brenda Joyce), accompanied by archaeologists, Sir Guy Henderson (Henry Stephenson), Bannister (Barton MacLane), Anders (Don Douglas), Splivers (J.M. Kerrigan) and McClour (Steven Geray), Boy becomes fascinated by these visitors, especially after witnessing items new to him such as a microscope and their stories of the outside civilized world. Cheetah, who earlier obtained an emblem dropped by Athena, presents it to Jane. Sir Guy finds the emblem belongs to a lost Amazon tribe and asks Tarzan for help in locating them. He refuses and orders them to go. Not wanting his new friends to leave, Boy escorts them to the civilization himself, leading to all sorts of trouble in the horizon for all.\n\nAside from the standard routines normally found in &quot;Tarzan&quot; films, the writers of TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS toss in some routinely situations found in family life. Tarzan and Boy have their one-on-one arguments as any father would have with his son. Sheffield&apos;s Boy, who usually looks up to Tarzan in a hero worshiping sense, as would any little boy towards his father, show signs of adolescence by acting out his frustrations, questioning authority, namely Tarzan&apos;s. For Boy, who has known no other existence except roaming around half-naked throughout the jungle, boredom has now taken its toll, causing Boy to have an attitude, especially when finding the archaeologists more interesting in comparison to Tarzan. Tarzan, believing that Boy will forget these men, invites him to go hunting as promised, but Boy stirs up trouble by saying he never wants to go hunting with him again. Tarzan&apos;s frustration is sensed when breaking Boy&apos;s hunting bow. While this doesn&apos;t really make as strong a statement as father and son relationships are concerned, this does prove that these two characters are just like anyone else. In typical fashion when father and son are on non-speaking terms, it is usually the mother, Jane in this case, to come to Boy&apos;s aide, and not taking sides. Boy, showing no signs of wanting to burst out singing, &quot;Oh, My Papa,&quot; can be just as stubborn than Tarzan. Tarzan believes Boy will eventually calm down and return home, unaware that he and the researchers are being held prisoners by the Amazons, never to be seen or heard from the outside world again.\n\nWhat makes TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS worth viewing is the presence of famed Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya playing the Amazon Queen. Short in size, slow in speech delivery, heavy accented, but no raving beauty to say the least, those familiar with her on screen personality normally feel her presence in any sort of motion picture. Henry Stephenson, who was earlier seen in TARZAN FINDS A SON, appears for the second and final time in the series, while Barton MacLane, most noted for his gangster roles or playing good tough guys in Warner Brothers crime dramas of the 1930s, makes an impressive villain in his first of two roles in the &quot;Tarzan&quot; series.\n\nLight on action and long on dialog during its 76 minutes, TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS makes interesting character study and routine adventure for any juvenile crowd. TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS, along with the others in the series based on the characters created by Edgar Rice Burrough, at one time popular viewing on commercial television in mid-afternoon or after-midnight hours some decades ago, was resurrected on the American Movie Classics cable channel (1997-2001) and Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: June 4, 2011). Never distribute onto home video, it was put on DVD along with the other RKO Tarzans in 2009. Next chapter: TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN (1946)(**)",

My absolute favorite sketches are the Harvey Pitnik critics corner/funeral sketches. The critics really tore Harvey a new one (LOL)! All the roasters (comedians) were great, but my favorite was Rip Taylor, especially when he says &quot;you know the old saying in show business, get off quick, like Harvey on his wedding night!&quot; When i heard that, I laughed so hard, that i probably have an uncured hernia to this day from it. Of course i cant leave out the blacks without soul/ Don no soul Simmons albums (my second favorite), Arnesio Hall, bs or not, pirates, titans, and every Vangoe must go, and the Amazon Women movie itself. These were all very funny. I cant wait to get this on dvd one day. 8 STARS OUT OF 10."

      "reviewBody": "SUSPECT ZERO (2004) ** Ben Kingsley, Aaron Eckhart, Carrie-Anne Moss, Harry J. Lennix, Kevin Chamberlin, Chloe Russell, Nicole DeHuff, William Mapother. (Dir: E. Elias Merhige)\n\n&apos;Se7en&apos;  &apos;Silence of the Lambs&apos; = &apos;Zero&apos;\n\nTrying to make a serial killer film, a sub genre that appears to have overtaken the unstoppable killing machine teen slasher (think Jason or Freddy) that took horror films to another level, must be like attempting to build a snowman in July: not much fun and pointless since it&apos;s damn near impossible to perfect an impossibility.\n\nTake the case of this unique perspective to a 15 minutes-of-fame and ticking category : a serial killer killing serial killers! OK now try to convince me for nearly two hours of my time why I should care? Well it was a good idea. \n\nAnyway the premise of the latest style over substance take on it is having a disgraced FBI profiler named Mackelway (Eckhart) being reassigned to the desert of New Mexico when he finds the dullness only adding to his current state of blinding migraines (he chomps on aspirin like Chiclets) until a ghastly murder is found at the border  literally  with some follow up faxes sent directly to him. It seems a former specialty agent, O&apos;Ryan (Sir Ben acting up a storm), who was assigned to a shadowy sect project entitled Icarus (read: getting too close to the sun; burning  foreshadowing of things to come) where highly intelligent applicants were able to &apos;see&apos; the minds of serial killers at work and transcribing their thoughts into para psychological scribblings in charcoal pencil that would lead them to their quarry. Apparently it has affected O&apos;Ryan to the point of obsession and causing him to act as a rogue executioner of the filth he was assigned to locate. What happens next is a series of murders of murderers that lead a grisly wake to some serious soul searching for one Agent Mackelway. To complicate matters his former partner  and ex-lover  Agent Kulok (Moss) has been called in to help him and his new prickly boss Charelton (Lennix also late of the &apos;Matrix&apos; flicks) crack the case wide open.\n\nI admit it seems a tad outrageous that someone could psychically forecast an upcoming crime however it is set in fiction and there was a cool &apos;X-Files&apos; episode &apos;Unruhe&apos; that had a similar story but it involved Polaroids instead of sketchings. Regardless you have to give the creative team an A for effort yet the screenplay by Zak Penn and Billy Ray is a Luke-warm reheating of &apos;Se7en&apos; with Kingsley as an ersatz John Doe serving up justice with a nasty slicing off of the victims&apos; eyelids to show what he sees they see and the &apos;Silence of the Lambs&apos; backbiting of its federal peacekeepers at odds with what they cannot. \n\nEckhart seems wasted of his talent in a somewhat muted turn  he should be more tortured if that is what his character is implied to be and Moss is undeniably sleepwalking her way through the film no thanks to bad lighting making one of the screen&apos;s most lovely women look downright homely. Kingsley has proven to be a very versatile actor notably ditching his Gandhi peace for sinister doings in &apos;Sexy Beast&apos; a few years ago and here he makes the most of his deeply troubled psychic warrior with a few moments of glass sharp scares. \n\nDirector Merhige a relative newcomer employs the usual shaky camera work with some interesting visual courtesy of his ace cinematographer Michael Chapman with its desaturated colors and vibrantly dark moments that underlie the terror at hand. Too bad it couldn&apos;t shed it in a more intriguing light."

His visual imagery is flamboyant and decorative, yet never fails to deliver the goods.  There is always a flurry of images to grasp our attention.  Granted, his typical trademarks are here, but never does the script suffer from the same problems as in his other works.\n\nNicolas Cage and John Travolta are phenomenal in their dual roles each.  The rest of the cast isn&apos;t very deep and is more filler than anything else.  The editing job feels underdone, particularly when the action sequences get to the &quot;overcooked&quot; staged.  Still, how many speedboat chases or airplane crashes are you going to see in a slow-motion?\n\nOverall, a summer action movie that delivers in acting, directing, and most other departments.  4 out of 5 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "When I decided to write a review of Rio Lobo, I had every expectation of visiting the website and finding that the movie&apos;s weighted average was a 2.5.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it&apos;s a 7.5, and that&apos;s actually a half-point higher than my own score.  To cut to the chase:  I liked Rio Lobo.\n\nIt was fashionable in 1970 to trash Rio Lobo because (a) it was the supposedly feeble, last effort of a great director, Howard Hawks, who had supposedly lost interest in the picture; (b) it was too derivative of Rio Bravo and El Dorado; (c) the Duke was too old to play the part of a cavalry colonel (to say nothing of being too big; the average cavalryman in the Civil War was 5&apos;7&quot; and 135 lbs.); (d) the supporting cast was pathetic; (e) the production values were poor; and (f) the movie paled in comparison to Little Big Man, which was released at the same time.  Much of the criticism was true.  But, it was fun to watch, anyway.  \n\nFord had his cavalry trilogy, and Hawks had his Rio trilogy, and the Duke was in all six of them.  The Ford set is a cut above the Hawks set, but all six films are worth watching.  Ford was working with Wayne (1947-50) at a time when Wayne&apos;s acting ability was still very much in question.  And Ford succeeded on every level, especially in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, where the character development of Capt. Nathan Brittles (Wayne) is nothing but sheer genius.  Hawks, on the other hand, had (by 1959, in Rio Bravo) a very established star, and was thereby free to dwell more on story telling than he was on character development.  Besides, with those amazing exteriors, the cinemagography alone was worth the cost of admission to all six pictures.\n\nThe Duke was too old to play a romantic lead in this picture (but so was Cary Grant in his last picture, Walk, Don&apos;t Run, when he, too, was about 63 years-old.)  The fact that he was not a &quot;threat&quot; to O&apos;Neill&apos;s character (in those pre-Viagra days) was nothing more than an extension of the persona the Duke captured the year before in True Grit, and would continue to build on in such films as The Cowboys and The Shootist.  Let&apos;s face it:  Wayne was becoming a likeable old coot.  \n\nHawks was, according to reports, disappointed in Jennifer O&apos;Neill, and by the last reel, her part has been cut in favor of Sherry Lansing&apos;s part. (Hawks did the same thing to John Ireland&apos;s part in Red River, 30 years earlier.)  Actually, O&apos;Neill didn&apos;t do THAT bad.  My problem with her is that she couldn&apos;t decide whether she would play her part as the New York high-fashion model that she was, or as Kim Darby reprising her role in True Grit.  At times, O&apos;Neill&apos;s semi-imitation of Darby gets on one&apos;s nerves. \n\n And, Hawks was rightfully disappointed in the desultory performances of the supporting cast, with the exception of Lansing and Jack Elam.  The Confederate cavalry captain: He might as well have been created by computer graphics, for all the vitality he brings to the role.  But, take a look at the stock players, including Hank Worden (&quot;Old Mose&quot; in The Searchers) and Jim Davis (Jock Ewing of Dallas fame).  These are virtually cameos, if not walk-on parts, but they are effective.\n\nI do not think Hawks gave up on this film, at least, not to the extent that people have claimed.  Yakima Canutt ably handled the second unit, and the train hijacking he directed (with Hawks&apos; help) was unusual and exciting; the cinematography, but for the occasional lighting or filtering error, was acceptable; and the editing was fairly crisp.  The interior sets were shabby, that is true.\n\nBut what carries the picture is the wonderful dialogue, and Wayne.  The dialogue is &quot;pure Hawks&quot;:  spare, unambiguous, natural, and realistic. Wayne&apos;s onscreen personal is so great, and his presence so magnificent, that all of the films shortcomings are rendered irrelevant. \n\n Thank you, Mr. Hawks.  Well done.",

Sharp, over the top, and rather fierce lil&apos; film that&apos;ll have you bugged out all the way till its conclusion. Though its only an hour long, the director packed in so much detail(including a gangster with a finger spinning phone/gun, missing lizard posters, an electric mattress, a supercharged guitar and more), humor and backstory that it seems as if the film is much longer but this certainly isn&apos;t a bad thing at all. One hour is more than enough and the filmmakers knew this instead of taking two hours to set everything up. This film is like an electrical surge to the senses. Like watching a car wreck but in slow motion. Hard, pounding music, crazy narration, sharp cinematography and an excellent use of the black, grey, silver, and white color tones only adds to the furious pace of the film. Not to mention some very funny performances by our two leads/challengers- a violence prone, guitar shredding lizard detective(imagine a Japanese Ace Ventura), and an electronic peeping tom/hitman/technogadget geek with split personalites(and half a metal mask). But, what makes these characters very cool- A shared love of electricity and an ability to conduct and harness it to use as they wish. This film is like a slow burn with two very volatile opponents slowly but surely heading on a crash course with each other. A very very very fun, funny and entertaining film. Highly recommended. 10/10"

      "reviewBody": "When they arrive at his home town for a big celebration, a man&apos;s girlfriend is captured by his psychotic ex and tortured for stealing him away from her while he and his friends race to save her before it&apos;s too late.\n\nThis one here is a rather curious thriller rather than an out-and-out horror effort. One of the main issues with this one is the really bland pacing, which has the abduction placed oddly later in the film than it should because it deals with the useless extraneous moments in the film where she&apos;s dealing with outside issues that have nothing to do with the main torture scenes. The majority of the scenes consist of either her attempting to get away only to be stopped without any kind of true punishment offered only to repeat the process again or his friends telling him to get on with his life, and it manages to plod along lifelessly instead of generating any interest. Rather than doing any kind of physical, damaging torture, it features only knock-outs or drugging and carries on in a series of lame parts that give off a thriller feel more than a true horror film, and the painful, agonizing moments of her trying to win him back or pining over a rejection don&apos;t help this one much. The finale does have some pretty decent moments, including the clever discovery of the kidnapping, some brutal confrontations down in the basement and a rousing conclusion, but it&apos;s all too claustrophobic and confining to really get where it could&apos;ve gone. This is just too flawed and has too little right about it to really be of any importance.\n\nRated R: Language and Violence.",

      "reviewBody": "Night Must Fall is directed by Richard Thorpe and adapted to screenplay John Van Druten from the Emlyn Williams play. It stars May Whitty, Robert Montgomery, Rosalind Russell, Merle Tottenham, Alan Marshal, Matthew Boulton and Kathleen Harrison. Music is by Edward Ward and cinematography by Ray June.\n\nWhen the rich but cantankerous dowager Mrs. Branson (Whitty) hires engaging but mysterious handyman Danny (Montgomery), her niece/companion Olivia (Russell) becomes suspicious of his motives.\n\nEmlyn Williams play (he played the role of Danny himself on the stage) is brought to the screen with splendid unnerving rewards, the end result being a genuine thriller, the kind that seems all the more better for being filmed in classic era monochrome.\n\nWith the tone set from the off, where we know there is a murderer at large, director Thorpe takes great care to ensure characterisations of the principles are firmly given room to breath. He has to do this since the film runs at just shy of two hours in length, but never once does the film or story sag. This is because of in the main the performance of Montgomery.\n\nWith MGM suits worried about Montgomery being cast in the male lead, since he was after all at the time cast against frothy type, producer Hunt Stromberg got his way and was duly rewarded when the pic became a critical and popular audience hit. Montgomery (Oscar Nominated Best Actor) is terrific, his portrayal of Danny is a blend of childlike shenanigans and sinister undertones - crowned by a nerve tingling last thirty minutes of the piece.\n\nMontgomery is well backed by the Great Dame Whitty (Oscar Nominated Best Supporting Actress) and Russell, the former delightfully gruff but melts under Danny&apos;s charm, the latter deeply conflicted on an emotional level as things start to twist and turn in the plot. This is highly recommended to any classic film fan who has a bent for those Gaslight type thrillers where a woman may be under threat and the protagonist may just be too good to be true... 8/10",

I must say I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing.\n\nWritten by Mick Garris and Neil Cuthbert, based on story by Garris and David Kirschner. It is the story of a young teen named Max (Omri Katz, who I always remember as the kid from EERIE, INDIANA) mistakenly wakes up the Sanderson sisters (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy). Along with his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw) try to stop the sisters from draining the lifeforce out of the children so that they could live forever.\n\nWhile certainly not scary it does have nice atmosphere and some laughs to be had. I had a smile on my face through much of the film. One problem I did have though was with some of the effects. The effects with Thackery (Sean Murray) being turned into a cat and him running around the rest of the film as a cat just screams 1993 and is no longer effective, but I easily forgave the effects due to other things going on screen. Also starring Kathleen Freeman as the teacher Miss Olin and Garry and Penny Marshall in a funny scene. Supposedly a sequel is on its way.",

      "reviewBody": "Epic musical theater with Hildegard Knef and Curd Jürgens\n\nOn February 8th, 1963 the time had come: the German-French film adaptation of the DREIGROSCHENOPER / THREEPENNY OPERA by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill premiered in the GLORIA-Palast in Munich. Directed by Wolfgang Staudte and produced by Kurt Ulrich, the film was shot in the Berlin-Tempelhof studio with a huge cast of stars. The plot is largely taken from the play, the music was adapted somewhat to contemporary tastes with a larger orchestra.\n\nThe plot about the criminal Mackie Messer (Curd Jürgens), who is up to mischief in London at the turn of the century, can be assumed to be familiar. The cast is more interesting anyway. Lino Ventura plays the police chief Brown, June Ritchie can be seen as Mackie&apos;s bride Polly Peachum, whose parents are played by Hilde Hildebrand (Große Freiheit No. 7) and Gert Fröbe (GOLDFINGER!). Walter Giller, Siegfried Wischnewski and Erna Haffner appear in smaller roles. A casting coup from Hollywood is at the start as the moral singer: Sammy Davis Jr. Sings Brecht and Weill as if he had never done anything else.\n\nAnd then Hildegard Knef (Decision Before Dawn)! Stepped in for Giulietta Masina, who was actually supposed to shoot her third film for Kurt Ulrich. Of course, Hilde was a better fit! Of course she sings the song about the dive bar Jenny and the pimp ballad together with Curd Jürgens (The Spy Who Loved Me). You simply have to see and hear this!\n\n563,000 tickets were sold in the West German box office. It couldn&apos;t have been because of the star line-up. The lack of popularity was more likely due to the fact that the image quality and coloring could no longer meet the standards of &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee / Treasure in the Silver Lake&quot; (1962). But the film is definitely worth seeing, not just for educated people and theater goers!",

To most the premise itself seems to have been done before but No it has not the way that this film does it. All is revealed in this film and the cause is actually believable. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that enjoys horror films. The people that got on to give this one a low score obviously know nothing about the genre and need to go rate movies like High school musical or Paul Blart the Mall Cop.

This is, by far, Demi Moore&apos;s best film to date as she shows so much emotion as a single mother stuck in a difficult position between working for the mafia in order to save her family and herself.  Moore truly deserved an Academy Award nomination if not a win, and the Razzies were very out of line by giving her Worst Actress for this (it was moreso for &quot;Striptease&quot; and that also wasn&apos;t that bad...a thing about the Razzies, they don&apos;t know what the hell they&apos;re talking about half the time).  Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the villain and Anne Heche gives all she has as the token best friend.  Ted Tally&apos;s (&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;) script is riveting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A great suspense film with a great performance by Demi Moore...see it and believe it. 8/10",

Well, yes. The whole Thunderbirds series was nothing but pure Hollywood at it&apos;s best; and this movie - as well as the one that came afterwards - only served to expand that tradition, whilst still maintaining the elements and formula that made it famous in the first place in 1965. The movie, has style, wit, incredible drama, and for its time, an astonishing view of the mid-21st.Century. Of course, most of it was pure fantasy and could never ever be real. The amount of times i&apos;ve heard it said that the Thunderbirds machines couldn&apos;t even get off the ground is enormous. But that&apos;s ok, it&apos;s fantasy. And what good would  a decent adventure be, if it didn&apos;t transport you out of reality and into a fascinating fantasy world where everything was different! As i say, the best Hollywood tradition. And of course, what made these productions so very special (at least to us Brits), was that 1. it was British, and 2. the heroes were all Puppets! Unbelievable to this day, i know. Yet as we are soon to be confronted by a million dollar live-action Thunderbirds epic, i think it is true to point out, that the main charm in the Thunderbirds adventures WAS the fact that they were acted by Puppets. So charming, so much a throwback to our own innocence (let alone a throwback to a much more innocent time when it was made); how could that be improved upon? The model work and special effects, especially the Zero-X Space-probe, are all extremely effective (as you would expect from Derek Meddings), and whether you are a Thunderbirds fan or not, it will be hard to knock this piece of Movie/TV history off it&apos;s perch. This movie being years ahead of its time, a great piece of fun and a fine addition to a classic series."

      "reviewBody": "The one enduring image from this film that has haunted me across the years is the weird hunchback assistant to the villain. Its an image that was splashed across horror magazines of my childhood. There was something about the twisted fellow with an eye that drooped to his cheek that made you want to see the movie. I never saw the film as a kid and it wasn&apos;t until tonight, well into my adulthood, that I managed to see the film. I can&apos;t say I was disappointed.\n\nThe plot concerns Dr John Pierre who is wrongly thrown in jail. He is redirected to the asylum/prison run by Dr Callistratus so that John Pierre can help Callistratus with his experiments concerning blood. As those outside the prison attempt to free him through legal means Pierre is forced to deal with the strange goings on in the prison, including fending off the sadistic Carl, the hunchbacked assistant of Callistratus.\n\nGothic, and grandly over the top in the way that most of the Hammer films weren&apos;t this is a cheesy but fun attempt at copying the Hammer Studios formula. It looks and feels very much like Hammer in it styling and plotting (Then again Jimmy Sangster of Hammer wrote the script) .Shot in color, the print I saw was well worn and a bit faded. I wonder how this would have looked at the time of its original release. It must have looked great. I loved the sets which were done in such a way as to give the illusion of space, unfortunately it turned every location into spaces the size of football stadiums (though in several sequences things were much too cramped).\n\nThe whole thing reminded me of the sort of thing you used to run across at 2am on late night TV with too many commercials. Actually as much as I liked the film I do think it is a bit plodding and probably could have used either trimming or a commercial break or two.\n\nStrangely this film is very difficult to see. I&apos;m at a loss as to why this film has fallen through the cracks over the last 40 odd years. Its not a bad movie, though it is a tad creaky and of a style they haven&apos;t done since Hammer stopped making movies. Perhaps its simply a matter of falling between the cracks in finding a distributor (it was not done by a &quot;major producer&quot;), or more likely the fact that there is no vampire with wings and fangs as promised in the title. What ever the real reason its a shame because this film is worth a look.\n\nIf you like Hammer style horror or good but rarely seen films, search this one out and give it a try. Its certainly worth a bag of popcorn on a Saturday night watch movies.",

And she steals Duplex from Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore.\n\nEssell&apos;s portrait of a bothersome old tenant is a tour-de-force. Somehow she&apos;s sympathetic despite being a royal pain in the ass.\n\nStiller and Barrymore do so well I almost started to consider Barrymore to be a legitimate Barrymore. You know, an actual actor instead of just a smirking twerp. Watch her face at the restaurant when Stoiller is ranting.\n\nAnd Stiller, well, his comic talents are under-appreciated in a world where Adam Sandler baby-talk movies haul in billions of dollars.\n\nOK, they have murderous intent. But who could blame them. I would have murdered the old bat within a week.\n\nAt any rate there are a lot of laughs in this movie. I don&apos;t understand what else people want out of a movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen this film several times and enjoyed it, I would say it has relevance if you have been on a linguistic holiday or met people that have done just that. Filmed for the most part in Ramsgate, Kent, United Kingdom with a mixture of young French and British actors / actresses, the film deals with the trials and tribulations of young French kids going to the UK for a linguistic holiday. Whereas &quot;L&apos;Auberge Espagnole&quot; ( which dealt with the same theme ) has mature adolescents as the main characters, this film is about real kiddies and is much cuter than &quot; Auberge &quot;. Also it was made many years previously so there are no lewd passages or bad language. This makes it more of a pleasure to watch. The atmosphere of the UK at the time is well rendered and many young French schoolchildren will be able to identify with their compatriots in the film.  It appears the film was VERY successful in France in 1976 when it came out.\n\nThe title of the film is rather misleading, as our young friends have little success chatting up English girls and end up with other French girls ! But the original intention was to chat up the young Brits ( and thereby to presumably improve their standard of spoken English ).\n\nAs often happens during these kind of linguistic holidays, the kids tend to regroup with others from their own country, thereby reducing the need to speak a foreign language ! That of course is contrary to the aim of such a holiday but it is a hard fact !!  The music used, notably that of Mort(imer) Schuman is very good and a whold generation of young French people know the film and remember it through this music.\n\nAs an Englishman living in France, I find all that rather amusing and making for good light entertainment. I haven&apos;t the foggiest idea whether the film is known in the UK but, as someone knowing what makes the British laugh, I would not see it as having much success on that side of the Channel ! Though it may bring back pleasant ( or perhaps less pleasant ) memories for British families who have welcomed foreign kids for summer courses. I have seen very few comments on imdb for the film so presume it is not too well known outside France !"

      "reviewBody": "Letter from Sean Bury:\n\nHi Stephen and Judith,\n\nPlease forgive me, but my Friend Anicee died nearly 10 years ago this coming November 6th... her wonderful husband rang me that same evening with a voice so full of deep sadness ... It was all I could do just to thank him and express my deepest empathy for him and all the children .... and even now I still find it painful to discuss, some days I can and some when I just just cannot..... this is a cannot day.\n\nThe pain never goes... as I am sure you know the feeling when you lose someone with whom you realise suddenly that you were very close to when you were at an important moment of growing up.\n\nBut you learn to live with it... then you realise that you haven&apos;t thought about her for the last few hours..... then a few days... then a whole week passes.\n\nAs I mentioned, sometimes in life things are best left the way they were.... I am a fervent believer it is part of the greater plan of things......\n\nThat last meeting we had nearly a year before in 2005 had been quite revealing to both of us.... and very moving in an emotional way. We were both amazed and also sorry to have lost contact for so long.... but that did not diminish our friendship or our respect for each other as very young professional actors all those years before.\n\nI cannot hide it.... but neither of us was very fond of the other off screen... just mutual professional regard for the other.... no one believed us of course. We were always playing pranks on each other.... till it got out of hand. But that&apos;s for the book... that I hope may get published. ... But I am not holding my breath. As my dear Indian friend has taught me.... She says &quot;If it is written in the sands of time..... then it will happen...... But the winds of time will one day erode even the faintest of memories of it&apos;s passing. But the heavens shall know it forever&quot;..\n\nPlease don&apos;t be offended... But I left the acting life I once knew behind me so many years ago now.... This is a different chapter in my life..... like all of us.... we all have many chapters and at the very least one good story in us all. I am certainly blessed with so many wonderful memories... and that is where I would like to keep them. I learnt that to walk away from that wonderful magical life... was probably the best thing for me at that time. I still have no regrets ... in fact I still believe that I am the luckiest guy I know ! These days I work late shifts.... and I blend quietly into the background..... but the same message of love is still passed out through me.. maybe to a lot fewer people in one go these days... :) a far cry from that other Sean. But that&apos;s the only difference.\n\nI shall write to Paramount Japan to see if they have any plans to clean up P&amp;M VHS copy and to release it on DVD... But I doubt it.... I have very little influence over such matters.... But you never know till you try.\n\nKeep the ideas flowing...... and may you both continue to love and give support to each other.... it&apos;s all way too short.\n\nLove, light and magic.\n\nSean Bury.",

It seems to be a forgotten movie which is too bad because its lots of fun. The script is excellent--most of it is a comedy but they also bring up interesting and serious insights into love, sex and relationships. The entire cast is great throwing off one-liners left and right. Also this is a fascinating social documents of the late 1960s to see how couples lived, the things they talked about, the fashions they wore and the houses they had. Sure it&apos;s dated but I was never bored. Also it&apos;s fun to see 20 year old Tim Matheson in his first film (playing a teenager!). Worth catching.",

Though the issues of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes way beyond those narrow parameters and instead penetrates into ground-breaking novelty and trail-blazing uniqueness. Here we have a true love story, as written by the woman involved in this love affair, told in a brilliant aggressive style that extols the virtues and glory of mad passionate love. I &quot;love&quot; this endorsement of the only emotion that makes life truly worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand. And for those who haven&apos;t yet been in love, even just the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living - because love is worth having even if but for a short time - even if you lose - because love is the &quot;stuff&quot; - the essence - of life. This film works for me. A warmly felt experience!",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m fascinated by films made during World War II, particularly those not from the usual suspect countries, so that made finding Katyi (1942) a real treat. Made in Hungary, which had aligned itself with Nazi Germany, it revolves around a young would-be actress, Katyi, who is humiliated by the star of the theater company, Peter, at her audition so she sets about ruining his life as revenge. When a baby is deposited on Peter&apos;s door, Katyi uses the leading man&apos;s innate kindness to set her plan in motion.\n\nThere is not a hint of war in this. It is part comedy of errors, with a couple of genuine laugh out loud bits, and part backstage musical with a couple of stage numbers included to calm the nerves of a stressed out audience. This could easily have been churned out in Hollywood - or Berlin - it is absolutely of its time stylistically and technically. Director Akos Rathonyi breaks little new cinematic ground but it&apos;s easy to see how his career spanned from the &apos;30s to the &apos;60s, although, perhaps suspiciously, he chose West Germany over staying in Hungary after the war. Klari Tolnay as Katyi is good playing just the right amount of goofy minx for her role, as is the charismatic Tivadar Bilicsi as the playboy actor.",

He is goodness and purity fortified by love, and his acts change the people he encounters, as much as the miracle working dove. The story is told in a natural manner and simple style, yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini&apos;s surrealist fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring, uplifting movies ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "And, when William Raynor takes a screenplay credit as Bill Raynor, that is an instant tip-off one is about to visit the Land of the Gobblers. First rattle out of the box Peter Graves, as a nuclear scientist, is inspecting his handiwork flying over a bomb test area and crashes, and the next thing he knows he awakens in a California cavern. His host, John Merrick, bulb-eyed and dressed in pea-green, introduces himself as an Astronian scientist from Astrol Delta, and is on a mission to destroy the human race. He explains that the sun if falling on his home planet and the billion or so Astronians must take over another planet---Earth. Astro Delta and Earth evidently do not share the same sun or else their master plan would just be a short-term solution to a long-term problem. \n\nSo old Daneb-Tala shows Miles, or Doug, some gigantic reptiles and insects of the hair-lice variety---these are really, really big mothers---and the main and only item produced on Astro Delta must be these monsters because they have a bunch of them. A really, really  big bunch of these really, really big monsters. But they need a bunch as their master plan to take over Earth is to have these monsters traveling around and about and killing off all the earthmen. Daneb-Tala does not mention women, so one can only shudder at the thought of what the Astronians have in mind for them. And Daneb-Tala seems to be unaware of the danger that an American housewife with a can of Flit and a flyswatter---albeit a really, really big flyswatter--- could pose for his master plan.\n\n And Daveb-Tala informs Doug that oh-by-the-way you were killed in the plane crash but us Astrolians, with skill, knowledge and instruments beyond the current knowledge of man---and he doesn&apos;t even capitalize man, just to show we ain&apos;t much in the bulb-eyes of the Astrolians. But they are going to use Doug as their unwilling-but-helpless slave in supplying the Astrolians with top-secret atomic-energy information. Gee, they can bring a dead guy back to life but can&apos;t split an atom?\n\nDoug can&apos;t tell what he has seen, heard and been through, for fear of being locked up in a Nervous Place, but the Army slams him with a needle full of truth serum and hears his story. They of course don&apos;t believe it---we must of overdosed him---and proceed to prepare Nervous Place papers on him, but government red tape being what government red tape is allows Doug to get away. And Doug has a plan of his own. He has learned that the Astrolians are all holed up in caves scattered all over California, and their diet is an all-electric one and if they don&apos;t have electricity they will blow up. They are stealing it naturally because even Astronians couldn&apos;t afford to pay California electricity bills. And, as soon as Cable TV came available, they intended to steal it also.  So Doug plans to pull the one switch that supplies all of California with electricity.\n\nNot wishing to write a &quot;spoiler&quot;, even for a movie that a spoiler would be a surprise for any viewer with an I.Q. of anything over 29, the ending will not be given away here.\n\nBut since California has gone to rolling-blackouts, has anyone seen any Astrolians anywhere in the state...Carmel, O.J. Simpson houseguests and the Golden Globe Awards show excepted."

      "reviewBody": "A short documentary on the early years of Rock band Pink Floyd taken from the film &quot;Tonite Let&apos;s All Make Love in London&quot;, &quot;Pink Floyd: London 1966-1967&quot; is a fascinating glimpse into the cultural capital of the world in its time and one of the stellar musical lights that rocked it. Featuring footage of the band jamming in the studio and scenes from the UFO Club and Alexandra Palace in London from 1966-1967 the film is a visual and audible kaleidoscope of vivid colors and varied sounds showcasing the dancing &quot;freaks&quot; in the audience and the Floyd performing onstage. The film is an interesting fly on the wall view of the great band in action particularly the now mythical Syd Barrett. The group&apos;s lengthy instrumental excursions into the cosmos are listenable but they&apos;re no Allman Brothers or Grand Funk Railroad so the musical experience can be of the tedious persuasion. But the history alone overcomes any shortcomings. Priceless and historical this is a time capsule captured for the ages.",

      "reviewBody": "I wonder if Ray Milland was roped into Something to Live For due to a contractual obligation, but I don&apos;t have to wonder if he was insulted - of course he was! Did Hollywood see him as anything other than a chronic alcoholic? His role in this &quot;romance&quot; is practically a sequel to The Lost Weekend, but somehow his character manages to be even more unlikable. There are some movies you can watch him in that show him as a great actor; in this one, he&apos;s just Ray Mi-bland.\n\nJoan Fontaine is also just Joan Fontaine. Her hunched posture, inability to voice the ends of her sentences, and her ill-fitting smile are all present in this role, not distinguishing it from countless others she played. She&apos;s meek and mousey, going on a bender every time she has to perform onstage. If she feels that way about an audition, reading, or opening night, she has no business seeking a career in the theater. Instead of calling AA whenever she collapses, the well-intentioned bellhop Harry Bellaver should have called an employment agency. Joan is a joke.\n\nAt the start of the movie, Harry calls Ray to come over for an emergency drunk resuscitation. Ray is unnerved because AA segregates them by gender, and Joan should have had a woman come. Nevertheless, he spends the evening with her and helps her back on her feet. When he returns to his own home, his wife Teresa Wright isn&apos;t happy that he&apos;s still involved with alcoholism even though he&apos;s kicked the habit himself. There are so many flaws with this plot, it&apos;s not even a pleasure to watch and criticize it. Ray would never have been allowed to be a sponsor if he was only one year sober and still holding on by a thread. He would have had his own sponsor, to whom he would have told he&apos;s mentoring a single (supposedly attractive) woman; and his sponsor would have put a stop to the dangerous behavior immediately.\n\nThe &quot;romance&quot; of the story is also a problem. It&apos;s extremely obvious that Ray is only attracted to Joan&apos;s weakness. She makes him feel strong by comparison, and his wife reminds him of his past mistakes (through his own conscience; she never actually does this). Is the audience supposed to think theirs is actually a deep love? Joan is unhinged and would cling to anyone. Through their clandestine relationship, doesn&apos;t the audience recognize the signs of addiction? Ray starts lying again, he experiences highs and lows, he makes excuses to see Joan when he knows it&apos;s unhealthy, and he enjoys his alternative persona during his secret life. How are we supposed to root for these people? How can we think their affair gives them &quot;something to live for&quot;? I was very mad at Harry&apos;s character, encouraging an adulterous relationship when he had no stake in Joan&apos;s future. If he was Joan&apos;s brother and truly believed Ray was the only man who could help her live another day, he might rationalize his aiding and abetting. He holds no investment and should therefore stay out of their lives.",

Graphics were not extraordinary, but they weren&apos;t terrible. Jojo turned out to be a sarcastic, funny actress and Sara Paxton did a pretty good job on being the clueless mermaid. Emma Roberts was a little bit rusty on acting, but she can sure tear up. Yea it was cheesy, but what&apos;d you expect, at least it wasn&apos;t unbearably cheesy.

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s unfair to compare this horror movie of the pre-WW2 vintage to Richard III of the Bard. While the Tower of London builds on Shakespeare&apos;s vilification of Richard III, this tale is much more of a dark genre that was popular at that time and which continued up until after WW2. These are the days of Revenge of the Cat People, Frankenstein and its sequels and other films that strike the mood of those post depression times. The censors of the time forbade any explicit sex or violence and what you saw was always highly stylized. However, presenting a stylized horror film, mild, if not downright tame, by today&apos;s standards, required a great deal of subtlety from the actors, which is something sadly lacking in today&apos;s slice &apos;n dice menus. These new horror films are so predictable and rely on gore and explicit violence to provide the thrill which like pornography requires each new presentation to up the ante in mindless antics, each trying to out-gross the previous. So, what have we here in this fine old film. The classic tale of Richard Crook-back. We have the great Basil Rathbone as the Black Duke and Boris Karloff as his fictional sidekick, Mord. Yes, Karloff is nearly a stereotype for the evil henchmen who&apos;s willing to carry out the furious demands of his heartless master. But, there&apos;s a young Vinnie Price as the Duke of Clarence awaiting a drowning in a vat of Mumsey wine. The action line of this classic story moves quickly, the lines are spoken clearly and the the acting is superb. What else do you want from a 1939 horror drama?",

      "reviewBody": "In His Chart starts off slowly and almost fall off its own rails, before smashing all the right buttons to engage the audience and finishes extremely strongly. Such is the pacing of the film, but once it grips you, it is likely to stay with you. The film talks about a relevant dilemma that all young medical professionals will eventually face – a decision about which direction to take. In a way it is relevant to everyone, as working life is universal and every career choices we make will ultimately question ourselves about whether to follow your passion and heart or the wiser and more successful choice. Director Yoshihiro Fukagawa deals with the notion of loss, life and hope in the most simplistic fashion and while Aoi Miyazak is competent in her role as the young doctor&apos;s wife, one would have thought that a little more insight or development into her character would certainly enhances the film. Still, there is a lot of smile about this film, as it does eventually engages you, affect you and touches you. It is a kind of film that grows onto you and before you realise it, you have already bury yourself into it. If you can ignore the at times uneven and slow pacing, In His Chart is extremely well-meaning and warms to the audience by finishing strongly. It is by no means a perfect endeavour, but as film that provides an insight into the stress, the difficulty of constantly dealing with loss in the medical profession, In His Chart does well and could have been a lot worse \n\nNeo rates it 7.5/10\n\n\n* www.thehkneo.com\n",

      "reviewBody": "Belle and Sebastian was originally a novel by the French actress and writer, Cécile Aubry. The story was very popular and was made into a French live-action series in 1965. Oddly, it later was a Japanese anime in the 1980s and now is a French film. Although the story is quite popular in France, I&apos;d never heard of it and I cannot compare this film in any way to the other projects. The anime, series or book could be a lot better or worseI just don&apos;t know.\n\nThis film is set during WWII in the French Alps. Sebastian is a 6 year- old boy who lives with his adopted grandfather and his niece. The boy is amazingly independent and resourceful—and as the film progresses you marvel at the kid&apos;s courage and tenacity. Initially you see it when the men of the village go off in search of an animal that is killing sheep. They assume it&apos;s a dog that has gone feral and they are determined to kill it. One day, Sebastian is walking in the hills and encounters the dog—and this Great Pyrenees doesn&apos;t seem particularly aggressive and the boy stands there and calmly talks to it. When the boy sees the dog again later, he even gets the dog to allow him to pet him and soon the pair are friends. But, the men have vowed to kill this animal and when Grandpa sees the animal, Sebastian goes so far as to stand in front of the dog to shield it from the gun. This is a good thing because later, it turns out that it&apos;s NOT this dog that is harming the sheep. Additionally, towards the end of the film, the dog turns out to be a serious blessing. But, what that is and how he helps saves some lives is something best seen by you.\n\nAlthough this film has some Nazis in it, the film is appropriate for all ages. The violence is not too extreme and the film is similar in style to the old movie &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;—charming and family-oriented entertainment. The star of Belle and Sebastian clearly is the location and the cinematography. It&apos;s rare to ever see a film so beautiful and the film truly is breathtaking. Additionally, you really have to admire the cast and crew for working some pretty extreme conditions to bring us the movie. Well worth seeing—particularly if you are looking for something you won&apos;t be ashamed to show your kids or mother!",

Qin, the Emperor, is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him.  The promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist.  Gong Li, as in just about every movie I&apos;ve ever seen her in, is simply fantastic. Her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged.\n\nIn case you couldn&apos;t tell, I loved this movie.",

Hopkins trains a new Zorro (properly portrayed by Antonio Benderas) to take his place and save California from a tasteless fate. What subsequently takes place is nothing short of first-rate entertainment. The film has delightful humour and well choreographed sword-on-sword sequences. The musical score by James Horner provides additional supportive elements to capture all of the film&apos;s diverse moments. Excellent direction by Martin Campbell. A must-see."

      "reviewBody": "As an avid reader and lifelong book lover, there&apos;s no way this movie couldn&apos;t affect me personally! A world without books??? NEVER!!! Whether paper, online or audio, they&apos;d better be here to stay!!!!\n\nThe movie gets off to a good start, by showing the firemen off to what at first you may think is to fight a fire, when actually they&apos;re going to start one, by searching for and burning books! In this society, they&apos;re banned (why make people think and learn, when the soulless robots on what passes for TV can do your thinking for you and teach you enough to live in their one-dimensional society?)\n\nThe number 451 pops up all over: at the fire station, at the address of the fireman-turned-rebel, Montag (Oskar Werner), and of course, it&apos;s the temperature that paper from those outlawed books will burn! You see conflagration after conflagration of precious volumes and titles set to flame, all for your own good, of course!\n\nOskar does a good job as a dedicated servant of this braindead society, who comes to realize how wrong it is, and starts fighting back, even if it means committing an unforgivable crime.\n\nJulie Christie also does good in a dual role; as Montag&apos;s wife, Linda, who listens more to the &quot;family&quot; on the TV screen than to her husband, and as Clarisse, a nonconformist schoolteacher that Montag gets to know while commuting to and from work. Through her, he learns there&apos;s more to life than he&apos;s been living, and much of that can be learned through those volumes he keeps destroying. When Clarisse asks if he ever read any of those confiscated books, he soon finds himself looking through a volume of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and nothing&apos;s the same after that.\n\nIt&apos;s worth noting how something as simple as a hairstyle can enhance characterization. As Linda, Julie&apos;s hair is long and stylish (as are her clothes) and she gives a fashion model appearance. Her character, however, is vapid and bland. Aside from her addiction to TV and pills, she seems soulless and unfeeling. Even her seduction of Montag (not long after getting her stomach pumped) comes across as mechanical, without any real desire. She can&apos;t even remember when they first met, which gives you an idea of her true feelings for her husband!\n\nAs the short haired, plainly dressed Clarisse, Julie really becomes a whole other person, one who thinks for herself, feels strongly, and cries when a little boy at the school from where she&apos;s been fired (Mark Lester, two years before &quot;Oliver&quot;) runs away from her. Unlike all the other modern, fireproof structures, she lives in an older building, that may be flammable but has a lot of character.\n\nWhat stands out most is the solution a group of nonconformists found to the problem of destroyed books, a way to ensure they live on!! It gives what could have been a dismal film an upbeat ending.\n\nWell worth watching!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dodge City, Kansas - 1872. Longhorn cattle center of the world and wide-open Babylon of the American frontier - packed with settlers, thieves and gunmen&quot;.\n\n&quot;Dodge City... rolling in wealth from the great Texas trail-herds... the town that knew no ethics but cash and killing&quot;.\n\nEnter trail boss Wade Hatton, cunningly disguised as a dashing Errol Flynn........\n\nDodge City, an all action Western from start to finish, finds Errol Flynn {in his first Western outing} on tip top form. Based around the story of Wyatt Earp, Michael Curtiz&apos;s expensively assembled film charms as much today as it did to audiences back in 1939. All the genre staples are holding the piece together, dastardly villains, pretty gals, wagon train, cattle drive, iron horse, Civil War, shoot outs, fist fights and of course an heroic Sheriff. All neatly folded by the astute and impressive Curtiz. Aided by Sol Polito&apos;s fluid Technicolor enhanced photography, and Max Steiner&apos;s breezy score, Curtiz&apos;s set pieces shine as much as they enthral. A burning runaway train and the finest saloon brawl in cinema are the stand outs, but there are many other high points on which to hang the hat of praise.\n\nVery much a male dominated film, it&apos;s with the ladies that Dodge City fails to reach greater heights. Olivia de Havilland, who is always a feast for the eyes in Technicolor, disliked her role as Abbie Irving, and it&apos;s not hard to see why. There is not much for her to get her teeth into, it&apos;s a simple role that demands nothing other than saying the lines and to look pretty. Ann Sheridan as Ruby Gilman gets the more sparky role, but she sadly doesn&apos;t get that much screen time. Which is a shame because what little there is of Sheridan is really rather great.\n\nThose problems aside, it&apos;s with the guys that Dodge City is rightly remembered. Flynn attacks the role of Hatton with gusto and a glint in his eye. When he straps on the Sheriff badge for the first time it&apos;s akin to Clark Kent shredding his suit to become Superman. Yes it&apos;s that exciting. Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are growly and great villains, while comedy relief comes in the fine form of side-kickers Alan Hale and Guinn &apos;Big Boy&apos; Williams. Dodge City sets out to entertain, and entertain it does. In a year that saw other notable and lauded Westerns also released {Stagecoach, Jesse James and Destry Rides Again} give credit where credit is due, Dodge City deserves its place amongst those offerings. Most assuredly so as well. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "How do you fight an imaginary monster? Understand that it is your mind that makes it real. The paradox is that the mind can&apos;t change what it has created... because it believes in itself. I just received a copy of The Cube. I had not seen it in about 30 years. It made a strong impact on me as a kid... probably because children see their reflection clearer without all the assumptions that now cloud our sight. We search for meaning and children just see it. I have written plays because of the impact of productions like this. There is a lot of value here. It is certainly dated, but in a comedic sort of way that seems intentional. One of my first thoughts on seeing it again is that Jim Henson created The Cube and then he spent the rest of his life doing The Muppets... beautiful. A great tribute would be a reproduction of The Cube using The Muppets... Kermit trapped inside with all of the others coming through the panels... if you listen closely to the dialogue... you can hear them all. Don&apos;t miss this one.",

      "reviewBody": "I have a soft spot for b-movies and random westerns. This one is a run-of-the-mill cavalry vs. Indians job that suffers from uneven pacing, a miscast lead role, and over-reliance on formula plot elements. But there are a few interesting points that make it worth watching.\n\nOne of its chief virtues is the excellent job it does of capturing the day to day flavor of life in a remote cavalry outpost in 1870s southwest. The military manners, habits, and routines are portrayed with convincing detail. The class stratification between enlisted men and officers is utterly real. An early scene with dead soldiers being transported on horseback is played to grim, nauseating effect, with enlisted men displaying hardened indifference and black humor about the situation. All of this gives the film some weight and veracity.\n\nOn the other hand, it suffers from generic Hollywood artificiality, relying unthinkingly on shoot &apos;em up conventions of faceless Indians, and sporting a formulaic romantic triangle subplot. Another major problem is George Hamilton&apos;s performance. The character he plays is not particularly sympathetic or likable, and he does nothing to bring depth to it. He&apos;s unappealingly flat and cocky. A better actor in this key role would&apos;ve gone a long way toward breathing some life into the film, especially in its flabby, tedious midsection.\n\nBut the real reason to watch this film is Richard Boone. I&apos;ve liked him in just about everything I&apos;ve seen him in, but here he is completely riveting. He plays the tough, smart, experienced commander of the undermanned outpost. He&apos;s a lonely man, who feels keenly the burden of his job. Late in the film there&apos;s a scene where he discovers a scene of carnage, with a number of his men dead, and his controlled rage is very moving. He brings the only real gravitas and feeling to the movie, effectively communicating the weight of life &amp; death decisions and consequences. He&apos;s absolutely terrific.",

      "name": "More Ludwig Thoma than Karl Valentine",
      "reviewBody": "Young carpenter-apprentice Karl (Robert Seidl) grows up in Munich around the time of the last monarch, prince-regent Luitpold. A prophecy foretells that Karl will one day become a celebrated theatre-actor and comedian (much to the dismay of his father (Walter Sedlmayr), who wants to son to become a blue-collar worker). But for Karl the prediction is just the right excuse for his pranks, which he indiscriminately terrorizes his surrounding with (including thrusting sausages at Emperor Wilhelm II, smearing ink on the face of a banker or giving the dog of a local politician a shave).\n\nThe &quot;Lausbubengeschichten&quot;-Films, based on the stories of Ludwig Thoma of the 1960s and 70&apos;s were a major success in the cinema, especially in the southern part of Germany. Needless to say, the producer wanted to milk the recipe as long as possible, even after the reservoir of Thoma-stories ran dry. There were numerous spin-offs, many featuring the original &quot;Lausbub&quot; (eng: &quot;Little Scoundrel&quot;) Hansi Krauss, typecasting the child-star forevermore. The stories were all literally the same: youthful scoundrel would play harmless, little pranks, usually targeting the adults-world that was perceived as unfair or unjust. No difference with &quot;Die Jugendstreiche des Knaben Karl&quot; (eng: &quot;Youthful pranks of Karl, the boy&quot;), apart that many of the scenes have been adopted from the works of comedian Karl Valentin.\n\nValentin (along with his regular co-player Lisl Karlstadt) may well be the most iconic Bavarian comedians of all time, considered somewhat of a national treasure, to whom squares and statues in Munich were dedicated. The &quot;Charlie Chaplin of Germany&quot; (as some have labeled him) was a jack of many trades, his sense of humour having been both artistic and anarchistic, incorporating elements of dada, expressionism and, perhaps most importantly, dialectic. A keen observer, Valentin would most often base his satirical plays and stories on everyday life of contemporary citizens (or, as they would say in German, &quot;Durchschnittsbuerger&quot;).\n\nSadly, there is very little of that in &quot;Die Jugendstreiche des Knaben Karl&quot;. Like said, apart from the basic skeleton of Valentin-works, this owns more to Ludwig Thomas&apos; &quot;Lausbubengeschichten&quot; and is hence Karl Valentin only in name. The humour is conservative and harmless, just as you&apos;d expect from any other &quot;Lausbubengeschichten&quot;-film. So, it&apos;s not really the most suitable tribute to one of the most important German comedians of his time that has not only influenced humorists like Loriot and Gerhard Polt, but also Bertholt Brecht and Samuel Beckett. Hence, no more than an average 5/10, despite featuring a staple of excellent folk-actors like Gustl Bayrhammer, Walter Sedlmayr, Hans Clarin and Beppo Brem, only recommended to completists and hardcore fans of the &quot;Lausbuben&quot;-flicks.",

Moreover the story fails to stay focused as it wonders whether to focus on Eva and Lake&apos;s battle or Lake and Paul&apos;s love story. As someone mentioned, it tires to combine &apos;How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days&apos; and &apos;Just Like Heaven&apos; (both movies which I enjoyed) but fails to reach that level. None of the characters are likable. I found them to be quite irritating. The only bright light here is some of the comedy which manages to get some chuckles. Eva Longoria repeats her Gabrielle Solis act (of &apos;Desperate Housewives&apos;) except that this time her character is dead. She does provide some eye candy and is funny in some sequences. Paul Rudd looks careless throughout the entire movie. Lake Bell, though she doesn&apos;t act bad, there is something missing. Jason Biggs does well with what he&apos;s given. &apos;Over Her Dead Body&apos; is just a weak and forgettable movie."

      "reviewBody": "Stiletto is watchable for three reasons. First it is visibly the product of an industry in transition. The main character is a mixture of James Bond and the Godfather&apos;s hit man Luca Brasi: A Sicilian who owes a Mafioso because he once saved his life. He gets regular assignments to kill potential opponents or trial witnesses. But he also lives the life of an international playboy. So we have these typical casino/penthouse/yacht scenes with lounge music and heavily made up, lavishly jeweled dames with mountains of hair topping their heads. On the other hand, the style of the coming Godfather-movies announces itself. One example is the very bizarre, sepia colored title sequence recording the incident in which the hero got indebted to the Mafioso. It has an entirely different style from the rest of the movie, as if it was done by an entirely different crew. There is also a board meeting of the gangster syndicate with an interesting 360 degree pan from the middle of the conference table. The movie soundtrack is also remarkable as it has elements of the sixties and darker, quirkier tones of movie conventions yet to come to full bloom.\n\nSecondly, Stiletto boasts cameos of several people who later became stars or at least well known character actors: an amazingly chubby Roy Scheider as the mobster&apos;s lawyer (the physical frame goes well with the part), Charles Durning as a police officer, Raul Julia as a party guest and M. Emmett Walsh as the main character&apos;s racing buddy are the ones I recognized. I also thought I spotted Antonio Fargas, but he is not in the IMDb-credits.\n\nThirdly, the locations are well used. A large part of Stiletto was filmed in Puerto Rico, the final sequences take place in the Conquistador hotel complex, a masterwork of famed architect Morris Lapidus (also designed the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach). The places which represent Sicily are probably also locations in Puerto Rico, the rest of the movie was filmed on the Eastern Seabord and in New York. There is also an interesting meeting place of the O&apos;Neal and Ekland characters, a kind of an open meeting or festival hall with a partly colored glass dome.\n\nStiletto in many parts resembles a TV production. It is not a really great movie, but for anyone interested in the mentioned three points well worth its time.",

Ones can find mistakes in the script, in the sequence, everywhere in almost all films. New and old ones. Brazilian movie makers think they are Italians, but they are not. They think they are Fellini, Antonioni, etc, but they aren&apos;t. They are just a poor Selton Mello, and that males a great difference. Difference between somebody behind the cameras and nobody. That is typically a nobody movie. Dull, boring and a never ending movie. It is a movie showing Brazilian inland by a guy that had never been there and does not knows anything about there. The sequences in the countryside of Minas Gerais state are meaningless, false and fake. The dialogs in Portuguese sounds also fake: no local accent, no regional terms, no nothing. The make-up is also fake. There are female countrywomen leaving the crops after a day of work with a very nice hair, straight from a beauty parlor. And that awful movie, like all others in Brazil was financed by different levels of public entities with our people&apos;s money. But the core issue of my opinion is that this a RACIST movie. There is a single scene in which the character of Selton Mello, without any dramatic reason, says crystal clearly that black men smell bad. In other words black people stench. And I don&apos;t know the reason the movie was nominated to the Oscar, considering we are the second largest &quot;African&quot; Country in the world.",

      "reviewBody": "For a 90 minute film, this documentary does an admirable job of telling the tale of the making of the atom bomb. It&apos;s great value is the recording of interviews of some of the major players at a time when they had had time to reflect on the event. Since most all of those directly involved with the development of the bomb are now dead, this documentary is a priceless piece of history.\n\nThe events are centered around Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who became the director of the Los Alamos branch of the Manhattan Project that was responsible for the design, construction, and testing of the bomb. Oppenheimer was a person who had that unusual combination of a supreme knowledge of technology and theory as well as skills as an administrator. I think part of his success as an administrator was due to the respect he commanded from all who worked with him. Ultimately there were hundreds of scientists at the Los Alamos site; it was remarked that there has never been in history such a large gathering of world-class scientists at one place. I found it odd that there was no mention of Leó Szilárd who envisioned the idea of a nuclear chain reaction in 1933.\n\nUnfortunately Robert Oppenheimer was not alive to be interviewed for this film, but there is substantial archival footage of him. Robert&apos;s brother Frank, also a physicist, was interviewed at some length. There is archival footage of the destruction caused by the dropping of the two bombs, both the physical and human destruction. Such scenes require a strong stomach to watch, and what is shown is only a small glimpse of the horror. The dropping of the bombs had a profound effect on the scientists who were responsible for the development. Some, like Robert Wilson, abandoned all classified work. Oppenheimer--who made the remark, &quot;the physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose&quot;-- spent time after the war agitating for world control over nuclear weapons; he was never the same person after the war and became a tragic figure.\n\nGiven that the development of the atom bomb was a significant event in human history, there is no lacking of reference material. A complete exposition is contained in Richard Rhodes&apos;, &quot;The Making of the Atom Bomb.&quot; I found the fact-based docudrama, &quot;Day One,&quot; to be interesting, particularly in its dealing with the discussions surrounding the decision to drop the bombs.",

      "reviewBody": "Readers of John Grisham&apos;s book will find this film rather less of a thriller and more of a courtroom drama, albeit with a curious flat feel to it. The story is that of a legal action on behalf of a teenage boy denied coverage for an expensive bone marrow transplant by his family&apos;s medical insurer. Changes to the plotline to accommodate the story to the demands of film drama have removed the unique feature of the book  a largely successful attempt to make the details of legal civil procedure interesting. Francis Coppola is a very innovative yet conventional director (you could credit him with authorship of several current movie clichés) and his storylines develop according to convention. Thus the love affair, which is completely extraneous to the main storyline in the book, is pumped up, and the fascinating battle of wits between the lawyers played down. As in the book, Rudy is the tyro David up against the experienced Goliath, Drummond, but Rudy&apos;s inexperience is played up to the point that you wonder how he got this far. The trial judge, who in the book is extremely helpful to Rudy, is replaced in the film by a sympathetic but much more impartial figure. In Hollywood conventional courtroom drama, His Honor or Her Honor doesn&apos;t take sides.\n\nThat said, there is much to enjoy. Danny de Vito, playing Deck the paralegal (or `paralawyer&apos; as Rudy names him) who can&apos;t seem to pass the bar exam, is just brilliant. His Deck is a disheveled, unimpressive little guy who is nonetheless good at what he does, `rainmaking&apos; or finding new business. His strengths are his intelligence, his energy and his lack of pride; he is quite happy to chase ambulances and give cops backhanders for information. His ethics are simple: fight for your client, don&apos;t steal and try not to lie. While the Deck of the book verges on the grotesque, De Vito makes him less of an oddball and hence more sympathetic. Matt Damon as Rudy is wetter behind the ears and not such a quick learner as the Rudy of the book, but every so often he connects and we understand how he feels. Mickey Rourke is a bit too elegant as Bruiser, Rudy&apos;s erstwhile mentor, (who wears cufflinks on a tropical beach?) but it&apos;s also an enjoyable performance. Although the script tones down his role, John Voight is nastily urbane as superlawyer Drummond.\n\nOnce again we have a courtroom drama filmed in a grand but gloomy courtroom, in fact the lighting people seem to have been absent. We hardly get a glimpse of the face of one important minor character, Cliff the wife-beater, (Andrew Shue) yet there is no apparent reason for this. The way some of the scenes were strung together, and started and finished were vaguely familiar, and half way through it hit me - ` The Godfather&apos;, where scenes just seem to begin and end without any particular reason.\n\nOne thing the film does almost as well as the book is send the message (sorry Mr Goldwyn) that America needs to do something about its medical insurance system, if the present chaotic mess can be so described. The court system, while not perfect, comes out of it a bit better (David is able to beat Goliath fair and square) but as for lawyerswell, let&apos;s just say things would be a lot better if they stuck to Deck&apos;s minimal ethics. The story also might explain why John Grisham (who has a walk-on role as a lawyer at an al fresco deposition) gave up the law to write books, thus bringing pleasure to millions instead of (hopefully) winning retribution for a few."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Undersea Kingdom&quot; is fast-moving and exciting, better than most serials...with the added fun of seeing how the cliffhangers are impossibly resolved. One of my favorite superheroes who&apos;s never been filmed is Namor, the Submariner and this serial comes closest to rendering him on film. It&apos;s amazing how a very ordinary looking guy (Ray Corrigan) with an admittedly great physique can be transformed into a thrilling superhero just by donning a costume. This is the best example of the transformation by costume...Corrigan doesn&apos;t look anywhere near as imposing without that great sort of Aztec-looking helmet, the best flowing cape (far better than Superman&apos;s) and those nifty fish-scale briefs that turn transparent when the lighting hits them just right. Fortunately, our hero wears this impressive outfit throughout most of the series, and you will notice how much his presence is diminished just by removing the helmet from time to time. Despite the robots that look like lumbering water heaters and a sardine-can tank that announces its presence with an ambulance siren, this is a classic serial adventure that should surely please most action-hero and serial fans. It&apos;s a very ambitious and largely successful product for its times, with the added bonus of little of the tediously long previous chapter replays of later efforts in the genre. Highly recommended!",

It&apos;s not your expected typical adult action filled Transformers installment. You can tell this was written by an inexperienced amateur writer, Christina Hodson. The directing was fairly decent, considering this was Animator Travis Knight&apos;s first live action film he&apos;s directed. Not sure why the producers (especially Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg) decided to cheap out on these key elements, and then have to pay for pretty much every fake 10/10 review this film has on here. The film&apos;s soundtrack was a good throwback to some good 80&apos;s songs. Hailee Steinfeld was perfect as always, but pairing her up with Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and his banana seat bike, made them both look like they were 12 years old. Although still enjoyable, I expected more. Would I recommend it? Yes for kids, not really for adults. Would I see it again? Nope, but I&apos;m sure my 8 year old nephew will. It&apos;s a 7/10 from me.",

Well, I probably should have known what I was in for when I saw &quot;Starring Jamie-Lynn Sigler of the Sopranos!&quot; as its publicity. \n\nBasically, two guys on their way to a bangin&apos; woods party get a flat tire and pick up a random hot girl on the way. They go into the woods, and hear three cute sweet tales told by an over-sized boy scout. The first story is one of revenge--four football players are killed by a criminally insane janitor who escaped from a mental institution that conducted &quot;pain threshold&quot; experiments. Yeah. Death by croquet mallet--nothing is better.\n\nHonestly, I didn&apos;t really watch the second story. The third story has a bit of a twist--two girls decide to get even with their boyfriend at one girl&apos;s crazy-dead-grandmother&apos;s house. Chaos and death ensues! The ending that ties it all together is &apos;eh&apos; at best.\n\nI did not expect much. I really didn&apos;t. I love campy humor, but even this tried me. I would recommend this movie for twelve-year-old slumber parties and/or bad horror movie marathons."

      "reviewBody": "In 1929 the great D.W. Griffith directed his final silent film, LADY OF THE PAVEMENTS. He re-shot a few scenes to add talking sequences and a few songs. The sound discs have mostly been lost. The film was also released in a full silent version, which exists.\n\nThis is an astonishing film, full of great cinematic scenes and two marvelous star performances. To think that Griffith was considered a has been when he directed this film! Count Arnim (William Boyd) is bored and is scheduled to marry the Countess Diane (Jetta Goudal)whom he does not love, but the marriage has been arranged. One night he visits her only to discover her lover sneaking out through a passageway. When he confronts her, she admits she is the mistress of the emperor. But he dismisses her, saying he&apos;d rather marry a girls of the streets than this dishonest woman. Insulted, she hatches a plan to get even.\n\nWith her accomplice she finds a &quot;girl of the streets&quot; who can be trained and passed off as a lady to entice the Count. In a squalid cafe, they find Nanon (Lupe Velez). They offer to pay her for her time to play this &quot;joke&quot; on the Count. She accepts and is gussied up to be passed off as a Spanish girl of noble blood, just out of a convent.\n\nOf course the Count instantly falls for Nanon and they plan to marry. At the wedding dinner, the cruel Diane announces a special treat for the guests&apos; entertainment. She brings on the orchestra from the cafe and asks Nanon to sing one of her old songs. Humiliated, the girl tries to sing but breaks down and confesses all.\n\nDiane, sure of her revenge boasts as the guests leave that the has given the count just what he asked for: a girl of the streets. But Nanon stands up to the Countess and admits she was a cafe singer but never a girl of the streets. She tells the story of deceit to the Count and then repeats the story to the guests still milling about. The Countess Diane is left alone in the room, a figure of scorn.\n\nWhile William Boyd hasn&apos;t much to do here as the Count, the two leading ladies tear the place apart. Fiery Lupe Velez is superb as Nanon, taking full advantage of the comic scenes but then turning in a terrific dramatic performance in the finale. Jetta Goudal is gorgeous and lethal as Diane, using her haughty beauty to good effect.\n\nCo-stars include Henry Armetta as Pierre, Franklin Pangborn as the dance master, Albert Conti as Finot, George Fawcett as the Baron, and William Bakewell as the pianist.\n\nKarl Struss was the cinematographer and there are several great camera shots. In one, as William Boyd looks out a window as a departing coach, the camera follows his gaze out the window and down into the street and then reverses direction up and back through the window and past Boyd and across the room. It seems to be all one shot. In the finale when Lupe Velez is sure she has lost Boyd, she looks out and suddenly all the men in the room become William Boyd.\n\nThe Irving Berlin song &quot;Where Is the Song of Songs for Me&quot; is nicely sung by Velez and makes for a nice theme throughout the film.\n\nFor those who think Griffith could only do epics and rural melodrama, this is a must-see film."

      "reviewBody": "One of the most emotional documentaries I&apos;ve watched in a while. It largely transcends it&apos;s made-for-tv limitations/budget by being a gripping, heavy, and very well-told story, particularly once it&apos;s set up all the pieces. It explores a horrifying story in a clear and heartbreaking way, and the way it unpacks and criticises the institutions that made such an injustice happen is powerful.\n\nI&apos;d like to think this would at least be a little eye-opening for those who might have more faith in the system than me. I think of the things it did visually, in this regard, like emphasising a trivial news story that took up the bulk of a front page while a story on the Vincent Chin murder got relegated to the a smaller section at the bottom. And the way it focuses in on Chin&apos;s mother&apos;s clenched, shaking fist during one scene near the end- that was visceral.\n\nAs long as you can look over some of its technical limitations, it&apos;s an excellent documentary, though as a warning, it&apos;s hard to watch. The content might not be visually graphic, but the subject matter is disturbing, and it&apos;s hard to grapple with and confront just how unjust and awful the story here is.\n\nAnyone affiliated with Netflix who works on crime documentaries should watch this and take notes: this is how you tell a challenging crime-related story in less than 90 minutes, whilst being clear yet not dumbing anything down, and you don&apos;t even need much of a budget to do it.",

      "reviewBody": "German tries at horror and science fiction other than in silents have been rare and usually exceedingly flat - here&apos;s a fine example for this category.\n\nScripted by one Vladimir Semijow (spelling according to the credits), the story is vastly purloined from Universal&apos;s &quot;The Invisible Man Returns&quot; (1940) and would basically be a crime drama, were it not meant to be sci-fi horror and thus something different from the successful Edgar Wallace and Dr. Mabuse series of the days.\n\nThe formula works, though, as far as invisibility goes, with a guinea-pig first, then with the young scientist (Hannes Schmidhauser, also assistant director) himself. As luck will have it, there&apos;s a burglary into the factory he works for at the same minute, and, worst of all, a slaying, so that his brother (Hans von Borsody, with a greased quiff like Jack Lord in &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;) has to prove the innocence of the disappeared. Elusiveness of Schmidhauser and of the story&apos;s sense go hand in hand.\n\nFor complexity&apos;s sake, but rather to the filmgoers&apos; confusion, a whole bunch of characters is introduced. Together with Swiss Schmidhauser, there are more players from the country of producer Leo Höger, namely Charles Regnier (as the leader of the burglars) and Heinrich Gretler (as the inspector, often overplaying). Of the women, blonde Nielsen is there to provide the mysterious sex-appeal while dark Schwiers is responsible for the more trustful erotic as Borsody&apos;s g.f. But it&apos;s Regnier&apos;s henchmen trio who almost steal the show: Raoul Retzer in probably his only gangster rôle, Herbert Fux just spiteful as ever, and fat Jean Thomé plays a doomsome harmonica to it all (though somewhat contrasted to Bronson&apos;s in &quot;C&apos;erà una volta il West&quot; five years later). Ilse Steppat, Herbert Stass and Ivan-Desny (hyphenated in the credits) walk a fine line as major suspects.\n\nIf you like a whodunit touch, an early sixties b/w flair and a laugh every now and then at things that are meant to be completely serious, &quot;Der Unsichtbare&quot; is a must-see. Don&apos;t expect too much from special effects."

This last quote is commonly referred to as the &quot;Golden Rule.&quot; &quot;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you&quot;.\n\nAnother Great concept of Love and Respect is brilliantly portrayed in John Lennon&apos;s Wonderful song entitled «Imagine». I strongly advice you to listen to it on YouTube or Google it. Here follows the complete lyrics to the aforementioned song:\n\n«Imagine there&apos;s no heaven It&apos;s easy if you try No hell below us Above us, only sky Imagine all the people Livin&apos; for today Ah Imagine there&apos;s no countries It isn&apos;t hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion, too Imagine all the people Livin&apos; life in peace You You may say I&apos;m a dreamer But I&apos;m not the only one I hope someday you&apos;ll join us And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people Sharing all the world You You may say I&apos;m a dreamer But I&apos;m not the only one I hope someday you&apos;ll join us And the world will live as one».\n\nSongwriter: John Winston Lennon."

If you like stale British cerebral humor, maybe you should stay far away from this. I&apos;m sure we all have our favorite and unfavorite comedians. I happen to like Sandler because he is immaturely funny. I think Dave Chapelle&apos;s show is pretty damn funny too. I never thought Sam Kinison was funny (the screaming is annoying) nor do I care for Chris Tucker.\n\nI saw Billy Madison at the theater, a friend and myself and the 8 other guys randomly scattered around the seating area found this to be pretty damn hilarious. I laughed at about 8 different scenes and that is a lot for me for any one movie. I still laugh at a few of the scenes when I see repeats and yes I have it on video.\n\nThose of you who dislike this movie are more than likely too old and stuck on your Bob Hope type era comedians and refuse to admit any others. Sandler isn&apos;t the greatest comedian who ever lived but his shtick was fresh and original when this movie came out. I have a video of him back when he did stand up and the guy is brilliant. \n\nAgain, people who get easily annoyed and upset with the stupid type humor steer clear of this movie and save yourself the aggravation that these sad negative reviewers subjected themselves to.",

You have 5 good guys and 5 bad guys ... actually it is way more than that, but supposedly the main people ... who&apos;ll have to fight each other ... and fight they do ... a lot! Maybe even too much for some.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Shaw Brothers movies when I was little - I don&apos;t remember most of them. So I don&apos;t know if I already had seen this. If I did, I don&apos;t remember them having so much blood in them - I assume that German censors cut quite a bit out of them ... but that&apos;s stuff for another story. A really amazing cast here - one of my all time favorites ... with the director that discovered him ... David Chiang that is ... good fighting and as I said, maybe even too much ... a sort of ... well overkill (to end with a pun)",

It&apos;s an old legend or story. Is it real? I don&apos;t know, is Santa Claus real? Does it matter if it is true or accurate? Not to me, it is a well written movie with some incredible action. The visuals are stunning to say the least. The costumes are incredible and I am very happy that most of the movie wasn&apos;t filmed in the dark which seems to have become the habit of Hollywood these past few years.\n\nIt is sad to see Matt Damon growing old but he still did a great job, I wonder how long he&apos;s going to be able to keep up doing physically demanding roles. If I am totally honest I would have liked the movie with a younger man in the lead role, that would have been a little more believable to me.\n\nI totally recommend this movie, it has fantasy, action a tiny bit of romance so your girl can appreciate it, most of all it raises a lot of emotion. There were several times during the movie I was on the edge of my seat holding my breath anticipating the next moment."

Wes Craven and Eddie Murphy combine to make a film that subverts expectations while becoming classic spooky season film.\n\nI heard about this film due to its unique mark on Eddie Murphy&apos;s catalog where he explores horror and remains serious the entire film. The seriousness alone from Murphy makes this film seem kind of odd but as you get used to it it slowly gets better throughout the film. Eddie Murphy plays multiple characters and still avoids humor which is impressive but disappointing at times.\n\nWes Craven gives this film a spooky quality that is actually fear-inducing even with sub-optimal special effects. But I will say that the plot gets a little jumpy and doesn&apos;t really explain everything as it should be doing with a vampire from the Caribbean.\n\nIts not a great film, but it is a great Halloween film that will make people shiver due to fear or at least from cringe. Give it a watch but keep expectations low.",

      "reviewBody": "The Italian cult-directors from the seventies were genius, but also as unstable and unpredictable as the weather in my home country. Take Fernando Di Leo, for instance. With &quot;Milano Calibro .9&quot;, &quot;La Mala Ordina&quot;, and &quot;Il Boss&quot;, he directed three of the toughest and most relentless crime-thrillers ever made, and so I obviously expected for his &quot;Colpo in Canna&quot; to be just as violent and brutal in tone.\n\nBut what do you know, the cheerful musical tunes that accompany the opening credits immediately reveal that this will be a much more light-hearted and comical effort than usual from this director. &quot;Colpo in Canna&quot; is indeed a bizarre and wildly uneven mishmash of comedy (I even daresay slapstick), sexploitation, mafia thriller, and Poliziotesschi. These are genres/styles that are absolutely difficult to blend, and therefore it&apos;s probably the weakest Di Leo that I have seen (only &quot;Avere Vent&apos;anni&quot; is worse).\n\nThe best way to describe &quot;Colpo in Canna&quot; is like a very loose interpretation of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, with airline stewardess Nora Green (Ursula Andress) evoking a gang war between the two rivaling drug cartels in Naples and getting a lot of benefits out of it herself. The tone of the film is wildly uneven, and changes often and abruptly. After the jolly opening tunes, there&apos;s a nasty sequence in which Andress&apos; character gets brutally beaten up by the gang led by Woody Strode. The middle section is soft in tone, and mostly features random footage of Ursula Andress having sex or parading around fully naked. I simply must state that she&apos;s amazing to gaze at! The actress who became world famous as the first Bond-girl in &quot;Dr. No&quot; was 39 years old in 1975, but her body looks as fit as that of a 25-year-old, and she certainly isn&apos;t too prudish to show it! The last half hour then turns into pure slapstick, with a (massively overlong) fighting battle between the members of the two gangs on a fairground, a (massively overlong) and unrealistic car chase in the streets of Naples, and too much screentime for comic relief actor Lino Banfi in a dual role as clumsy police commissioner and horny taxi driver.\n\nUrsula Andress, who clearly enjoyed her whacky role as the floozy man-eating stewardess very much, forms the main reason for cult-fanatics to seek out this &quot;Colpo in Canna&quot;, but admittedly some of the stunts and the fairground and the impressive torso of Woody Strode are highlights as well.",

      "description": "Reverend Francis Ashby, a senior Oxford don on vacation alone in the Alps, meets vacationing American Miss Caroline Hartley and her companion Miss Elinor Hartley, the blossoming Irish-American girl she adopted many years before. Ashby finds he enjoys their company, particularly that of Elinor, and both of the women are drawn to him. Back at Oxford he is nevertheless taken aback when they arrive unannounced. Women are not allowed in the College grounds, let alone the rooms. Indeed any liaison, however innocent, is frowned on by the upstanding Fellows.",

The DVD format we watched recently seems to have been transferred with great care as the colors have a vibrant look, something that wasn&apos;t the case with the technique used during that era that made colors fade.\n\nThe film owes its appeal to Audrey Hepburn, an actress not known for being a singer, or a dancer, but who had enough charm to make the movie her own. The pairing with the great Fred Astaire pays off well because Mr. Astaire was always an actor who had enough chemistry with his leading ladies. Ms. Hepburn&apos;s costumes by Givenchy and the way she carries herself in them is one of the best assets about &quot;Funny Face&quot;.\n\nThe other surprise of the movie is Kay Thompson, who plays the magazine editor Maggie Prescott. Ms. Thompson makes an excellent contribution to the film as the no nonsense woman who ruled what the fashions of the day should be as shown in the pages of the magazine.\n\nThe songs of George Gershwin are complimented by the original music composed for the musical by Roger Edens, Adolph Deutsch and Leonard Gershe. The great cinematography of Ray June shows Paris at its best. Thanks to Stanley Donen all the elements feel into place and we were left with this musical that will delight audiences forever.",

It&apos;s habitual in Chabrol films to deal with particular issues, thus : Obsession , adulteries , assassinations , jealousy , treason and he makes a penetrating description of the middle bourgeois class . All those characters are well narrated in the film . The cast is excellent , Benoit Maginel is good , Melanie Doutey is beautiful and attractive . Natalie Baye and the veteran Suzanne Flonn are impressive. Cinematography by Eduardo Serra (Young of the earring pearl ) is nicely made although mostly developed at interior scenarios. The film will appeal to suspense fans and Claude Chabrol moviegoers. Rating : Above average. Well catching.",

This is shown by the richness of dialogs and curious anecdotes which constantly make you wonder which parts were completely true and which sprung from the author&apos;s vivid imagination.\n\nApart from the richness from the story and how the storytelling evolves smoothly throughout the film, the production design makes you feel completely Mexico in the 1930s. The costumes are great also.\n\nThe direction is almost perfect. Roberto Sneider takes you by surprise first at about minute 20, then slowly and smoothly hypnotizes you and never lets go.\n\nMuch credit goes to the lead Ana Claudia Talancon whose good looks and very well developed character arc make you fall at first for her beauty and innocence, and later for her humanity, courage and cleverness.\n\nDaniel Gimenez Chaco&apos;s performance deserves praise also. He captures the Mexican Macho Persona perfectly, his cynical viewpoint of things and comments, bring humor to a character who would be otherwise despicable.\n\nSecond characters like de Tavira&apos;s and others feel a bit underdeveloped, but in the end all actors do great jobs with their little screen time and their contribution suffice.\n\nThe drama never falls for the temptation to go overly melodramatic and dialogs are kept smart enough - even ironic at times - to make this movie a fresh and satisfying take on the Mexican way of life. It actually feels so accurate that deep thoughts of &quot;nothing has ever changed really&quot; do spring a few times.\n\nThe music and editing are very well done also.\n\nCongratulations to everybody involved!",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie when I was in college in the Seventies. I viewed the film again in 2001. The power of the film was the same on my senses. Several reasons come up: British Director John Boorman was at his best trying to outdo Don Siegel&apos;s The Killers (1967)-which also stars Marvin and Dickinson in somewhat similar roles. I will really be surprised if Boorman denies that he was not influenced by the Siegel movie.\n\nWhy did Point Blank make an impact on me? Was it Lee Marvin&apos;s raw machismo? No. It was Boorman, who gave cinema a brilliant essay on alienation. When Dickinson&apos;s Chris asks Marvin&apos;s Walker &apos;What&apos;s my last name?&apos; after a bout of sex and gets a repartee &apos;What&apos;s my first name?&apos; you can argue the alienation is embedded in the dialog. But Boorman&apos;s cinema includes the loud footsteps of a determined Walker on the soundtrack, somewhat like Godard in Alpahaville, contrasting bright wide open spaces for the exchange of money that goes according to plan and closed dimly lit confines of Alcatraz for those that go wrong. There is laconic humor without laughter, pumping bullets into an empty bed, guards who narrowly miss Marvin going up the lift, the car salesman&apos;s interest in an attractive customer than in his job, the sharpshooter&apos;s smug satisfaction not realizing that he has got the wrong manThe list is endless. \n\nThe camera-work of Philip Lathrop is inventive, but was it Lathrop or Boorman that made the visual appeal of the Panavision format of this film come alive? \n\nViewing the film in 2001, several points emerge. $93,000 was important to Walker, nothing more nothing less. But was it money he was after or was it the value of an agreement among thieves? The open ended finale runs parallel to the end of an Arthur Penn film (also on alienation)called &quot;Night Moves&quot; made some 10 years later. What surprises me is how a good movie like Point Blank never won an award or even an Oscar nomination.",

      "reviewBody": "Produced shortly after the Second World War in Germany, In Those Days is a film about the lives of ordinary people in Germany during the lead up to and duration of the war. The story begins with two mechanics disassembling a car after the war, and continues when the car itself begins to narrate the events of its life, meaning that most of the film is told in flashback. This device, of an object narrating its own past, is an interesting one at best. While it does allow for a quite broad and neutral perspective toward history, it is a bit too strange to really convey the plot without distracting from it. The car in question is also far too overtly personified to act in the role of a reliable, neutral narrator, instead it seems to have a personality and human point of view. The narration leads into a series of flashbacks telling the story of successive owners of the car. A problematic aspect of this device is that the car changes owners in successive stories with little to no explanation about the change of ownership. Taking this with the fact that a few of the actors in the early sections of the movie look somewhat similar to one another and it leads to a very confusing early section of the movie. More than once it is quite possible to assume that one character is another from a previous vignette, only to realize that the character is merely portrayed by a similar looking actor. Eventually you begin to assume that characters appear in only one story, and just as this fact has made itself comfortable a character from an earlier story makes an appearance in a later one. The disconnected nature of the stories causes the film to read more as a series of vignettes, with the car as a loose unifying theme, than as a solid narrative. Unfortunately the stories vary extremely in their ability to entertain, or even hold interest. One story will be quite interesting and well paced, while the next will be slow, ill-paced, and quite frankly boring. One of the few areas in which this film does excel is in portraying the slow slippery slope of the Nazi rise to power. Each story moves its characters further into the restrictive policies of the Third Reich. At first it is simply a man fleeing the country, then a composer whose music has been banned, a Jewish woman whose store is destroyed.\n\nAll in all this film seems to be best considered a curiosity, a so-so movie centered on an interesting, though poorly executed, plot vehicle. An interesting viewing, but best left for the curious and historically interested.",

Saddam has just fallen and his mass graves are uncovered all over the north area. This is of course very difficult. They hitchhike their way through the country with what means possible, including a body transport.\n\nThe fact is that more than 1 000 000 people have gone missing in Iraq during the past 30 years or so and this is not internationally recognized in some (including Arabic) countries as what it is. This movie highlights this.\n\nAn important movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Ironclad is a fictionalized medieval war movie set in Britain during the second rebellion against King John, brought about by his dismissal of the Magna Carta he was forced to sign in the first rebellion against him and his attempts to punish those who forced him to sign it. \n\nThe movie is basically about a Templar and a small group of soldiers who are attempting to hold Rochester Castle, the key to southern England, against the siege of John&apos;s superior army and Danish mercenaries. Ironclad is nothing special, but it&apos;s entertaining enough. There are a few faces you&apos;ll probably recognize among the cast, like Brian Cox, Paul Giamatti, and Kate Mara. I doubt any of the actors or actresses will be up for many awards (though Giamatti, as King John, does get a memorable scene or three), but they do good enough jobs that I had no complaints. \n\nThe look of the film is reminiscent of other recent similarly set action movies, like Black Death and Centurion. Very bleak, grey, and violent. Blood splashes all over the place during the frequent battle scenes, limbs are hacked off, and gaping wounds abound. This isn&apos;t a movie for the squeamish.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Ironclad isn&apos;t a huge step forward for this kind of film, but it succeeds well enough at what it attempts to do for me to give it a positive review. See it, if you&apos;re interested.",

      "reviewBody": "When servicemen of the sixties were polled over who was their favorite female star, Ann-Margret was it. To them, she must have been a tantalizing tease with big, red hair, and when she shook her head, it looked like it was on fire.  She must have kept them pretty happy with those moves of hers.  The camera always seemed fixated on her gyrating behind.  She was irrepressible; even if you knew better, you couldn&apos;t take your eyes off her.  (Elvis Presley at one point fretted that she might steal &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; right out from under him.)\n\nIn &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; she plays Fran Hobson, a sometimes-working singer/dancer holed up in Madrid who, between gigs, passed the time dreaming of landing Mr. Right.  He comes in the form of a young Spaniard doctor (Andre Lawrence) whose own dream is to render medical service to the poor, a dream which doesn&apos;t include a wife.  He changes his mind, of course.  What man in a uniform wouldn&apos;t?\n\nHers is not the most interesting romantic entanglement.  That one belongs to nifty Carol Lynley as Maggie Williams who harbors impure designs on her boss (Brian Keith) only to be publicly humiliated for them by his wife (a not-so-well-aged Gene Tierney).  Lynley ends up with Gardner McKay (whom I would confuse with Richard Beymer if I wasn&apos;t paying attention).\n\n&quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; belongs to a long tradition of movies with three single women in the leads seeking husbands as far back as I can remember as the 1932 release &quot;Three On A Match&quot; with Joan Blondell, Ann Dvorak, and Bette Davis.  With this one, director Jean Negulesco is actually remaking his 1954 &quot;Three Coins In A Fountain&quot; which won the Academy Award for best song.  The musical efforts in this movie by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen are respectable enough.  How could you not like Ann-Margret serenading the object of her desire with &quot;Something to think about&quot; or her bouncing her way through &quot;Everything Makes Music When You&apos;re In Love&quot; in a tight bikini?\n\nWith my favorite Italian actor in the whole wide world Vito Scotti as the girls&apos; next-door neighbor; Anthony Franciosa; and ditzy Pamela Tiffin to round out the sublet.  By the looks of the leads, you&apos;d think they were cast for their hair color.  Negulesco might have called this one &quot;The Blonde, the Brunette, and Big Red.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Of course this is a film where the soundtrack (and selling it) matters more than the film itself. Of course this is a film where the sponsors matter more than the film itself. Rather sadly, there are some stupid inconsistencies in the script (especially in the dialog) that could have been easily avoided by a careful revision.\n\nBut in spite of all this I must say that commercial filmmaking - that is only (re)inventing itself nowadays - in Hungary has produced a nice, watchable comedy that is not annoying at all, despite all its clichés and its cartoonish characters.\n\nIn fact, Hungarian commercial filmmaking seems to have found its voice at last. After some highly successful movies in the Nineties that looked back on the years of communism with a mixture of nostalgia and irony (Sose halunk meg, Csinibaba) and recently the &quot;modernized&quot; remakes of two Thirties blockbusters (Hippolyt, Meseautó), this is a last a film that talks about this young, successful Budapest people of today. This is probably the secret of its success: it features a simple story that is not very realistic but with which on can well identify, some nice ideas (these days, it seems to be the ultimate &quot;laugh-getter&quot; in comedies everywhere these days that an older, conservative, petit-bourgeois person gets high on cannabis products by accident - this scene is very funnily played by Ila Schütz) and especially good directing, costume and set design and believable actors that seem to have fun bringing a human side to their often quite clichéd characters. (I would especially point out Eszter Ónodi&apos;s touching performance.)\n\nThough the story and the characters themselves are nothing new, the scriptwriters and the director have nevertheless managed to give the whole environment a feeling of authenticity: there is not a single scene where you would think (though most situations are exaggerated and overdrawn) that a situation like this could never happen in Hungary, in an environment like this. It is probably this feel: &quot;yes, this is what life is like in Budapest today&quot;, that has made the movie such a huge success.\n\nThough definitely a popcorn movie, it is nevertheless worth watching because it captures the approach to life of a certain group of young Budapest people, of their hopes and dreams. It is also an example that a commercial film industry has started to establish itself in Hungary that is well able to create successful movies on its own, aimed to a Hungarian public that has up to now to be satisfied with Hollywood flicks. These Hungarian commercial films are of course not at all of higher artistic quality than their Hollywood counterparts, but they are closer to their own public and thus have good chances of capturing their attention and interest. This may also help to recreate a market for Hungarian films that has been lost after the fall of Communism and ameliorate the image of Hungarian filmmaking.",

All of them live with the likeable grandfather giving a generous support, the great Jose Isbert, and usual home appearance by Juan, the good godfather: Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez. Subsequently, there takes place various incidents, communion, holidays on Tarragona, first romances and a sad event : missing Chencho that causes a deep gap and an extreme searching for streets, Plaza Mayor, and broadcasting by radio and TV, too. Through numerous events we watch the agreeable life of this enjoyable and attractive family. At the end it takes place the surprising arrival a new set : a television.\n\nThere are several stories all around, including first communion two children, Elementary school, High school and other stories, as we are told of everyday family life, such as holidays on Coast Dorada , first loving, loss Chencho and his subsequent recovery . Alberto Closas gives a nice acting as the hard-working moonlighting rigger who lives for his extense family. He is really enamored his wife Mercedes well played by Amparo Soler Leal. Along with a lot of children performed by charming newcomers. Support cast is frankly excellent, plenty of all Spanish secondary actors as Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez, Laly Soldevilla, Agustin Gonzalez, Jose Maria Prada, Maria Jose Alfonso, Jose Sepulveda, Xan Das Bolas, Francisco Valladares, Jesus Guzman, Angel Alvarez, and, of course, Jose Isbert.\n\nIt contains a diverting screenplay from notorious writers as Rafael J Salvia, Pedro Maso and Antonio Vich. And atmospheric musical score by Adolfo Waitzman. As well as an evocative cinematography in black and white by Juan Marine. The motion picture was professionally directed by Fernando Palacios, being well and solidly paced. He was a good filmmaker who directed some acceptable comedies as El dia de enamorados, Juanito, Tres de la Cruz Roja, Vuelve San Valentin, Marisol rumbo a Rio, Operacion embajada, Buscame esa chica, La familia y uno mas and Whisky y Vodka.\n\nIt is followed by La familia y uno mas or The family plus one 1965 in which the life of the disproportionated family has undergone various happenings and distresses, as the birth a new baby, the sixteenth, coinciding the death of the mummy, Amparo Soler Leal, who left behind an irreparable sadness, as well as the grandfather has also dead.

      "reviewBody": "TODAY IT&apos;S ME...TOMORROW YOU!, aka TODAY WE KILL, TOMORROW WE DIE!, is a 1968 spaghetti western directed by Tonino Cervi and starring Brett Halsey as a Django lookalike who goes on the warpath to avenge the death of his wife. The film&apos;s origins are clear, with the straightforward revenge story concocted by Dario Argento no less. The first half sees posse members being assembled (a bit like THE DIRTY DOZEN) while the second sees them carrying out their mission of vengeance.\n\nThere&apos;s little in this movie you won&apos;t have seen elsewhere, but I was surprised at how well shot it is. The locations are atmospheric and the cinematography is excellent, with plenty of gritty shoot-outs for action fans. Characterisation is slim but the characters themselves are engaging, from Halsey&apos;s taciturn lead to the likes of William Berger, Bud Spencer and Wayde Preston as various members of the posse. The music is stirring and as a whole the production values can&apos;t be faulted.\n\nThe best actor of the lot is a real surprise: Japanese star Tatsuya Nakadai, star of the late Kurosawa movies RAN and KAGEMUSHA: THE SHADOW WARRIOR, playing the bad guy. Nakadai gives a multi-layered and extremely decent performance straight out of Japanese samurai cinema, and acts everybody else off screen. Simply said, he&apos;s brilliant and lifts the movie whenever he appears. The rating gains a star due to his presence alone.",

      "reviewBody": "Sonny Stein, shark conservationist and reclusive oddball is seduced by the wife of a wealthy entrepreneur and tricked into giving up his finned friends for scientific research and sideshow entertainment. But when Sonny discovers the ruse, he uses his mystical ability to command his sharks to hunt and kill those responsible.\n\nRichard Jaeckel was always an engaging actor to watch over many decades of distinguished film service, and despite his simpleton turn here, there&apos;s still a hint of the professionalism in his thespian skills, that will endear his character and have you rooting for the shark guy. Throughout the movie, Jaeckel&apos;s rather dim alter ego descends into paranoia and eventual insanity, culminating in a frenzied rampage led by his number one Tiger shark who he commands with a telepathic dominion. In flashback we see that his supernatural power is the result of an ill-fated trek in the tributaries of South East Asia, many years earlier, where he survived in shark infested waters, and was bestowed an ancient medallion by a local Shaman.\n\nBeing low budget, &quot;The Jaws of Death&quot; can&apos;t afford to rely on expensive special effects or the bells and whistles usually associated with shark attack pictures. Stunt men interact with real sharks, offering a raw, realistic view of the relationship between marine life and humans. Despite the daring sequences, it&apos;s an unappealing contrivance in which the two species look anything but comfortable in each other&apos;s presence, and disappointingly, the sharks look decidedly harassed and exploited, which doesn&apos;t convey the mutual respect Sonny is supposed to enjoy with his much maligned &apos;friends&apos;.\n\nAs much a character examination as it is a B-grade action-thriller, there&apos;s enough in Jaeckel&apos;s offbeat portrayal to warrant interest, and some familiar faces in the wings (Harold Sakata, John Davis Chandler, Luke Halpin) to provide character contrast. Worth a look if you find a reasonable DVD transfer that hasn&apos;t been re-produced from scratchy VHS source material.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 2002., a year after WTC tragedy, &quot;Kald mig bare Aksel&quot; has a title that doesn&apos;t make people pay attention. Surprising, as it&apos;s working title &quot;Aksel wants to be a Moslem&quot; could be more up-to-date in the year when Moslem themas were on the headlines. But maybe some people would find it too provoking, and that is something producers don&apos;t want to happen to a family movie.\n\nIn fact, this movie couldn&apos;t have come in more adequate moment. Promoting inter-religious tolerance it was bringing understanding and friendship among people instead of hate and disbelief that was raising due to hysteria induced by terrorist attacks. And this is typical for Northern Europe (so different from many other parts of the world - Middle East, Balkan, USA, Kashmir etc): they educate their kids and put peace in their souls instead of making every new generation remember without forgiving.\n\nApart from this, there is not much to say about &quot;...Aksel&quot;. Coming from a cinematography that has brought us so many excellent movies for and/or about children, this one doesn&apos;t bring anything new. It is a typical movie that all generations can watch (but adults might use that time for ironing or similar work, with one eye on TV just in case a child asks for some additional explanation). Incorporated in a good, simple, realistic plot, a lot of basic informations about Islam have been offered, sometimes on the edge of documentary or educational school program instead of movie. Younger kids might still like it; older kids are not target audience anyway.\n\nWatching this movie simply has to bring in mind brilliant Swedish drama &quot;Före stormen&quot; (made in 2000, before WTC!): both movies show relations between Moslems and native Europeans in most tolerant and democratic countries, with children and teenagers in the focus of the plot. &quot;Före stormen&quot; in a sharp and bitter way says that you never know who is your neighbour, the most quiet of them could be a hidden terrorist. &quot;Kald mig bare Aksel&quot; in a gentle and relaxed way says that Moslems can be as harmless and peaceful as any of your neighbours. And both of them are right.",

Cunning stunts, cool fighting scenes, slapstick, silly comedy etc etc. There are two, maybe three fighting scenes in &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; and they&apos;re pretty good. But the stunts aren&apos;t much to cheer for, the only thing we get is crashing cars and car chases. Which I totally despise. And there aren&apos;t a lot of comedy either. The lack of comedy, that I can live with. Because after all, this is more of a serious film, which isn&apos;t a bad thing at all, since Jackie gets a chance to prove to everyone that he really can act and that he&apos;s not just a Cantonese Buster Keaton clone with a big nose.\n\nThe second thing I have a big problem with the directing and the camera work. Gordon Chan (a relative?) does a pretty bad job directing, using lots of close ups and fast cuts, which makes it hard to get a grip of what&apos;s really happening. He should take a close look at what Jackie did as a director, especially in &quot;The Armour Of God&quot; and &quot;Operation Condor&quot;. Also, trying to make slow motion sequences by simply slowing down 24 frames/sec footage... Not a good idea. It&apos;ll look like crap, to be blunt. It would have looked a lot better with at least 48 frames per second.\n\nThis might seem very pedantic, but I&apos;m afraid these little details ruined the movie for me, although the all the actors did great jobs. Sorry."

Wilson,on the other hand does an adequate job.\n\nA surprisingly effective thriller and of course disturbing in the most shocking sense of way.This is sure one psychological thriller you ought to check out.",

      "reviewBody": "The ruthless and brutal Captain Ramírez (Ken Wood) hunts down and kills revolutionaries in his search for The Saint (Howard Nelson Rubien), the latter is a pacific revolutionary who advocates lookalike Gandhi non violence against the dictator Porfirio Diaz , he is the righteous leader of the Mexican insurrection against the Federales . The Saint is accompanied by his gorgeous niece Mercedes Hernandez (Luisa Baratto) along with a reluctant rebel and other Guerilleros commanded by the boastful Vilar (Fernando Sancho) , a slant-eyed mercenary who has other ambitious plans . Meanwhile , Captain Morrison/Killer Kid (Anthony Steffen) in order to save himself escapes from an US prison and goes to Mexico and he decides to join the Mexican revolution permanently . In the meantime , Captain Morrison/Killer Kid ensures that weapons destined for the Mexican government don&apos;t get there to avoid a diplomatic conflict and he clears a ravaged Mexican border town of murdering soldiers . When the villagers are attacked by the cruel Ramirez (Giovanni Cianfriglia as Ken Wood) , all of them flee to the mountains pursued by his troops . Killer Kid resolving a weapons smuggling issue and he attempts to bring peace and order the revolutionaries who are intent on killing the soldiers responsible for Mexican slaughters . The film is dedicated to the Mexican people . \n\nOffbeat Spaghetti Western that follows the Sergio Leone/Sergio Corbucci wake , but it is also proceeded in American models . It is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the tough protagonists Steffen and Fernando Sancho and the enemies as the heartless Ken Wood and his hoodlums . As well as enjoyable appearance of the beauty Luisa Baratto as Santos&apos; niece . The highlights of the film are the bloody slaughter at the Mexican village and the violent finale confronting at the mountains . The film blends noisy action , shootouts , violence , blood , and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining . Stars Anthony Steffen as an American officer who is actually an agent pretending to help Mexicans , Anthony is well remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados , but in his day , from the mid-&apos;60s to the early &apos;70s , Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics . The handsome , Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz De Teffè Von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there , Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre, where he found his niche . Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood , however , Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction . He played as a Man-With-no-Name a lot of Spaghettis as ¨Gentleman Killer¨, Garringo¨, ¨Apocalypse Joe¨, ¨Stranger in Paso Bravo¨ , ¨The last Tomahawk¨. Furthermore, here appears Italian Western&apos;s usual secondaries as Fernando Sancho , Giovanni Cianfriglia as Ken Wood , Fortunato Arena , Tom Felleghy and the Greek actor Yorgo Voyagis . This film belongs to the numerous group of flicks that are set during the Mexican revolution , called ¨Zapata Western¨ , like are the Italians: ¨ Duck you sucker¨, ¨The mercenary¨ ,¨Tetepa¨, ¨Los Compañeros¨, ¨What am I doing in middle of the revolution¨ and the American ones : ¨The wild bunch¨ and ¨The professionals¨. \n\nThere are many fine technicians and nice assistants as the professional cameraman Sandro Mancori who makes an excellent photography with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun shot on location in outskirts of Rome and El Lacio as well as in Cinecitta studios and Elios studios . The musician Berto Pisano creates a catching soundtrack and well conducted and in Ennio Morricone style . This Western Alla&apos;Italiana was well directed by Leopoldo Savona . Leopoldo Savona&apos;s direction is good , he made several Spaghettis under pseudonym as Leo Coleman: ¨Posate Le Pistole Reverendo¨ , ¨Killer Kid¨ , ¨Apocalypse Joe¨ , ¨Dio Perdoni La Mia Pistola¨, ¨Texas Il Rouge¨ ; adventure/war/drama movies : ¨L&apos;Aigle Rouge¨ , ¨L&apos;Ultima Carica¨ , ¨Fra Diavolo¨ , ¨Le DueOrfanelle¨ , ¨Weapons of War¨ , ¨Thunder from the West¨ , ¨Mongols¨ and Giallo/Terror : ¨Death Falls Lightly¨ , ¨Bytleth¨ , among others .",

I do remember it as being highly entertaining.\n\nDavid Niven plays a master criminal called &apos;The Brain&apos; who is so massively intelligent, one of the give away signs of his identity is that his massive brain occasionally causes his head to go off balance thus causing him to keep it upright in his hands (very gallic sense of humour as this film appears to be largely French made).\n\nHe plans a major robbery whilst trying to avoid the attentions of Interpol. One of the gang members is the great French comedian, Bourvil who had parts in among others &apos;Monte Carlo or Bust&apos; and the tv series &apos;The Flashing Blade&apos;.\n\nI would love to see this come on the tv again and can only think its been left off for contractual reasons over ownership of the rights and for royalty purposes."

      "reviewBody": "This is another &quot;Sexy Susan&quot; movie about the crazy adventures of a prostitute/madame named Susana in Napoleon-era Germany. It&apos;s in German,unfortunately, so I only could make out a word of dialogue here and there, and, to be honest, I completely lost track of the zany, madcap plot. It does SEEM to be a little more sophisticated than your typical European sex comedy, and might actually be pretty funny with English subtitles (I DON&apos;T regret, however, not getting to see a horrid English-dubbed version).\n\nThe main star once again is Teri Tordai, who was in all these &quot;Sexy Susan&quot; but really nothing else. There are also the usual amount of naked frauleins on display, except in this case their perhaps better described as signoras (Femi Benussi, Daniela Giordano) or mademoiselles (Edwige Fenech). That might really be half the fun of these films: spotting the familiar faces (and bare torsos) of actresses who would go on to bigger, if not always better, 1970&apos;s Euro-exploitation films.\n\nSome of the niche DVD companies have starting releasing some of the Italian period sexploitation films in recent years (like &quot;Ubalda, All Naked and Warm&quot; featuring Edwige Fenech, all naked and warm), and with subtitles rather than dubbing. I&apos;d be interested in seeing the Italian &quot;Decameron&quot; knock-offs, or some of the films in this German series get the same treatment someday soon."

Edward Espe Brown comes across as a very genuine teacher, and humble too--unafraid to share his own human emotions, his own work on himself. I appreciated his stories and sense of humor, as well as his gentle reminders of how profound and sacred our relationship to food really is, and how far we have lost this in the contemporary world. This is a contemplative and uplifting film with a lot of heart that made my hectic mind slow down and relax...\n\nAn added bonus is some rare video footage of the great Suzuki-roshi, author of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&apos;s Mind&quot;.",
