Towards the end the movie has lost it charm and is not enjoyable to watch anymore. It becomes repetitive and feels to long for its ideal self.\n\nWhile they have captures the atmosphere and the overall the aesthetic very well. Filmed in the Crimea region, where the hilly landscape not only comes close to the Spanish arid regions, but makes them even wider, even more epic.\n\nNikolai Cherkasov gives the old Knight Don Quixote a frail, spindly look, a man despite the ridicule and violence that sweeps against him, retains his dignity. Meanwhile, with Sancho Panza, played by Yuri Tolubeyev, as his chubby companion, makes his part crystal clear. He is the voice of reality, the contrast to the sprawling fantasy of Don Quixote.",

      "reviewBody": "Seijun Suzuki has a lot of nerve as a director, and I mean that as complimentary as it can sound. He pushes buttons without being too exploitive- he knows the genre by the back of his hand, has likely seen his share of 40s film noir and gangster pictures, and knows at least a little of the French new-wave (or rather seems to carry over a similar spirit). So he knows also, even more crucially, how to turn the genre on its head while keeping a sense of poetry to the proceedings. It&apos;s hard to pull off a sense of the poetic in a crime film, but Suzuki&apos;s camera techniques are to the quality that he can get his actors at the same level of a challenge of sorts. Branded to Kill is about deconstructing the myths of the hit-man, the qualities of emotion and subservience, of duty and sacrifice, the coldness, and the suppressed longing for death that is encompassing. And damn if it isn&apos;t a helluva lot of fun as pulp entertainment, a tale told with some strange characters and even stranger twists of fate, and loaded to the gills with sex and violence.\n\nThat last part, I might add, is important in seeing Branded to Kill in context forty years ago. Who else but Suzuki, and maybe Arthur Penn, would go for this level of bizarre violence and uncompromising sex at the time, and at the same time not turn it into some kind of B-movie spectacle? Come to think of it, the premise and essential plot is pure B-movie: a hired killer, Hanada, aka #3 (Jo Shishido, very bad-ass even as he goes crazy), is very good at his job, so good that he&apos;s able to kill #2 in a big shoot-out scene in the first twenty minutes of the film, as he escorts another gangster around. Coming back from that mission, he gets a ride from mysterious Misako (Anne Mari), who gives him a mission to kill someone for her. But it goes bad, he&apos;s kicked out of the syndicate, and now will be killed by his old bosses. This problem is broken up by two things: 1, #3 is so good, even under total stress from his girlfriend Mami trying to kill him (&quot;We&apos;re beasts&quot;, she says to him crying her eyes out in supposed guilt), he kills all of those who are supposed to kill him; and 2, he meets killer #1- the &quot;Phantom&quot; killer, who will soon kill him...&apos;soon&apos; being the dreaded word.\n\nWell, as &apos;pure&apos; as it can be under the circumstances anyway. It&apos;s essentially the story of an assassin who has the tables turned on him, and has to step up to the challenge- will he be #1? Can there ever be any kind of #1 in the world of hired killers? The last half hour is mostly only #3 and #1 in the apartment, as they both reach for their guns at the same time and neither uses them. It becomes a game of psychological torture (not to mention nerves), which reaches a fever pitch by the time the climax at the gymnasium comes around. But around this genre story we get Suzuki&apos;s style as a director, which is startling, provocative, tawdry, and surreal, whatever one could think to call it. Over the opening credits we see a tiny light go over the names, and the first shot is a random airplane image. There&apos;s plenty of indelible images from the film- killer #2 running out of the building on fire; the uproarious, delirious moths and lines and other figures that #3 sees around him at one point; the simple sight of our hero smelling his beloved rice, his first love; Misako in close-up staring at the killer in the rain- chillingly performed by Anne Mari like she&apos;s just got out of electro-shock- telling him her hatred of men and her lack of fear for death.\n\nBut around these images Suzuki is confident at casting his torn and frayed #3 killer (Jo Shishido gives the performance of a career, with him getting better as the film goes on and he&apos;s put in more surreal circumstances), and at being a master of compositions. He and DP Kazue Nagatsuka put just the right lift of suspense and danger to scenes, like the drunken gangster taunting to be shot in the tunnel, or #3 being told he&apos;ll be killed the first time and laughing it off, or even the near sci-fi-style of shooting the sides of the buildings. There&apos;s maybe a reason, aside from the perverse attention to dark comedy and weird drama in the proceedings, that the producers decided to fire the director after seeing his finished cut: he doesn&apos;t follow the rules, or whatever the rules might be in so much practice going into the norm, for shooting a traditional gangster film. Why not just keep the camera still on the whole building as a man falls to his death from the top? Or how about as our hero is on the phone we&apos;re seeing most of what&apos;s above his head in the apartment, then shifting below? It&apos;s a risk that Suzuki takes, to make the style reflect atmosphere of the urban landscapes, on top of that of the terrors facing #3, and only once or twice looking too self-conscious. In a word, it&apos;s hip.\n\nIt&apos;s probably not surprising then that the speed and energy and form of the style feels influential to so many who skate that line between mainstream and art-house, while at the same time doesn&apos;t feel aged at all. If anything, the sex is still hot, the sudden violence still shocking (and shockingly funny), and the ending as perfect a sum-up of the devastation of the ego of violence and death, the monstrosity of it, as could be imagined. I love it, in all its subtle, crazy independent wide-screen glory, and it serves as a great introduction to Suzuki&apos;s oeuvre.",

The Giving Festival Movie is not one of their best(the TV show, Land Without Feelings and the original movie) but it isn&apos;t the worst(Journey to Joke-a-Lot). It is though the only outing that I am not sure what I made of it. I&apos;ll start with what I liked. I did like the animation mostly, the character designs are more refined than they were in Journey to Joke-a-Lot and Oopsy Does It! and there is a lot of colour and vibrancy in the backgrounds. The music is sweet and whimsical, with Care Power On full of energy and the best of the three songs, while the three stories revolving around one main theme have a reasonable amount of heart and charm. The Care Bears are likable enough, and the conflicting characters while not as scary or as memorable as those of the 80s incarnations are good. On the other hand, while the stories are pretty good, the title of the film promised a more festive feel and because I felt that there wasn&apos;t enough of it it seemed misleading. The ending also had an abrupt and that&apos;s it? feel to it, this wouldn&apos;t be so much a problem if the movie wasn&apos;t so short, I think it could have been at least 5 minutes longer. The writing is also rather corny and mawkish for my liking. Overall, if I had to sum it up, after much deliberation, it&apos;s not bad but nothing really leaps out as great. Cute but bland is perhaps more like it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "THE GHOULS review\n\nIt&apos;s hard to fully immerse yourself in the latest low budget trend of DV filmmaking. Unless painstaking measures are taken to mimic the cinematic conventions of film, like depth of field and the crispness of the image, one can easily lose focus on the story and be distracted by the the quality of the picture, which  is more along the lines of a cop corralling a perp or a father getting kicked in the balls by his kid. However, Chad Ferrin&apos;s latest offering (I saw his first film UNSPEAKABLE at Sundance in 2000) uses the DV format not in an aesthetic gimmick (like BLAIR WITCH) but to further the dread and grit of his subject matter...for what it&apos;s worth I was appalled and enthralled...and it scared the shit out of me.\n\nTHE GHOULS follows a down-on-his-luck video muckraker (Ferrin sets up the main characters moral decent in a shocking prelude that will be a true litmus test for any viewer...not giving anything away but if you can survive the opening moments, you&apos;re in for a ride) as he prowls the streets, a stringer looking for a lead to both pay the bills and support his crank habit. To be frank, our protagonist Eric (Timothy Muskatell) is a piece of s**t that Travis Bickle would scoff at; We see him drown his sorrows in drink after coercing a man to murder while he shoots the &quot;exclusive&quot; footage, moments before the cops burst in. Yet with the over-saturation of media bloodhounds also scanning the street looking for a good lead and a juicy shot to sell, our hero is mostly plopped in a bar booth, killing brain cells and wallowing in his inner pain.\n\nNice horror in-joke: Cast as the TV news producer who sometimes buys Eric&apos;s footage but mostly berates our hero, Joe (DAY OF THE DEAD) Pilato is in fine form and, with Ferrin being an obvious Romero fan, gives the actor great lines and exploits Pilato&apos;s ability to make the word &quot;fuck&quot; seem evil again, like it was when you weren&apos;t allowed to say it in public when you were a kid.\n\nHowever, things change suddenly as Eric drives into the depths of Downtown L.A. one lonely Christmas eve, where he stumbles upon a gruesome, cannibalistic murder that happens right before his eyes in an alleyway, and from here the film goes full tilt boogie. Using his camera and the help of another video freelancer/&quot;vulture&quot; (Trent Haaga, who is by and large one of the best actors in the low-budget horror scene right now and used effectively as both comic relief and the &quot;young sage competition&quot; cliche), Eric returns to the scene of the crime to hopefully capture another murder, which could be the shoot of his career, but of course, like every good horror film, our hero is pulled into the darkness...and comes face to face with THE GHOULS, and himself.\n\nHonestly, I don&apos;t want to give anything else away mainly because when I was watching this, it was hard to take in, especially since the main character is so unlikable. But as the plot progresses he is faced with strange phone calls at night, bodies piling up around him as well as his own demons. Plus, the film boasts the most disturbing performance from a Down&apos;s Syndrome actor EVER.\n\nOn that note, along with Pilato mentioned before, all of the performances are effective in a low-key way. There is little &quot;acting&quot; here, mostly reacting and silence that says so much. Haaga is great as the &quot;sidekick&quot; but doesn&apos;t use the usual trappings to illicit a laugh; rather he serves as a humorous light is the depths of scum that surround this film\n\nThe film, shot on digital video, looks very good for it&apos;s limitations, and Ferrin knows where the camera needs to go to feel &quot;real&quot;, and once the film gets into gear I never once got taken out of it because of the medium. However, the sound design and the sets, for example the ghoul&apos;s lair and the cavernous pipelines and sewer systems, are AMAZING, especially after finding out there were mostly created and not found locations! The sound effects, which most filmmakers either take for granted with &quot;scare stings&quot; or neglect all together, make this film SCARY. The makeup effects are also effective and are a notch above TROMA quality but Ferrin is not afraid of a little splatter (thank god).\n\nI wish i could say something negative to balance out this review but I was very happily surprised with this. When I heard Ferrin was doing a digital feature, I was dismayed because I tend to not have the ability to enjoy a film on video unless it has an obvious contextual reason. Yet THE GHOULS inspired me to say &quot;fuck film&quot; and tell a story with whatever you have available, and Ferrin scares and disturbs with great style."

      "reviewBody": "One of those quick-and-dirty kind of killer B&apos;s made by small independents to cash in on box office smashes, RUBY tried to ride the coattails of Piper Laurie&apos;s Oscar-nominated turn in CARRIE, to which this movie owes more than just a nod of acknowledgment, along with THE EXORCIST and Brian De Palma&apos;s own CARRIE follow-up, THE FURY.\n\nLaurie collaborates with cult-film favorite Curtis Harrington, (NIGHT TIDE, THE DEAD DON&apos;T DIE) to try and lend credibility to the unique if unsteady story of a faded gun moll, just getting by living at a decrepit drive-in with her teenage daughter (Janit Baldwin, a good candidate for a game of &quot;whatever happened to...?&quot;) Seems Mama Ruby had a little more to do with her gangster hubby&apos;s demise than she let on, but no worries...Daddy&apos;s little girl is going to get to the bottom of things in a way that CARRIE would definitely approve of...\n\nThis is a tough one to find on late night TV, and tougher still if you&apos;re looking for the original Harrington edit, which had been butchered and diluted over the years by different ham-handed distributors and program directors. Not a classic by any means, but for creepshow completists, Laurie is like a female Vincent Price...her performances are worth catching even in the most Gawd-awful dreck. And though RUBY is hardly a gem, it&apos;s not quite THAT bad, either."

      "reviewBody": "In the very earliest days of cheap VHS releases, I bought MY NAME IS MALLORY for less than ten bucks. It was the second VHS tape I picked up, the first being DAY OF ANGER under another title, GUN LAW I think. I never got around to watching MALLORY and it disappeared before I got serious about collecting spaghetti westerns. It&apos;s a good looking widescreen film, made at Elios Studios. I recognized a set from DAY OF ANGER, also used in DEATH RIDES A HORSE, the staircase in the saloon unmistakable. This one was not filmed in Ameria, Spain though, exteriors are in the countryside around Rome. Larry Mallory (Robert Woods) buys a ranch along with his partner, Col. Hasper (Renato Baldini). It used to belong to the Amblers, Bart (a very mean gunfighter, and his lovely sister Cora (the luscious Gabriella Giorgelli) and they want it back. Bart is willing to kill and steal to make it so, but Cora is innocent of his deviltry. Bart&apos;s main partner is Block Stone (shades of Dash Riprock!) played by Artemio Antonini. He&apos;s very good and reminds me physically of Eli Wallach&apos;s Tuco. He&apos;s a formidable opponent for Mallory and they have a terrific fight which leaves both men out of action for awhile. And the elusive Carla Mancini plays Maria, a maid who pours water on Cora while she&apos;s taking a bath. I believe it&apos;s one of the few identifiable roles she played. MY NAME IS MALLORY is an elusive movie, but it&apos;s worth seeking out. Robert Woods is good as always, although he sports a funky hair-cut in this one. He&apos;s a half-breed and I guess the pony tail indicates that. A solid six, spaghetti western fans will enjoy it more than non-fans.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to confess that Portuguese production films have deserved my attention in recent times, and I have been more satisfied with what I find. Even so, I feel that Portuguese movies are often lacking a truly cinematic thinking, as many films are still apparently more thought to TV than to the big screen. Here, I do not seem to me that it was the case.\n\nThe screenplay needs no presentations: the story of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, reevaluated and revalued about ten years ago, far at the expense of a television contest for the choice of the greatest Portuguese figures in history, became an example of the hospitality and generosity of the Portuguese people, and the self-denial and sense of honor that should guide a public man and a diplomat. By ignoring government orders, which prevented the granting of visas to Jewish people (in an attempt to please the Nazi regime and to keep Portugal in a state of neutrality difficult to manage, but imperative), Sousa Mendes saved the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people who would probably have been killed. Subsequently, he was dismissed and forgotten, dying in misery and not watching the rehabilitation of his name.\n\nExcept for the main character, the movie is taken by a simple conception of its characters. Vítor Norte did a good job as Sousa Mendes, although it seems to me that he made the diplomat a figure too impassive... even when furious, as in the milk glass scene, he seems devoid of personality and spontaneity. Was Sousa Mendes really that warm? Joaquim Nicolau was also up to the challenge proposed to him, giving life to a diplomatic attaché in a very institutional and credible way. Leonor Seixas does a good job, but she has a character who doesn&apos;t seem to demand much from her. Veterans Manuel de Blas and Laura Soveral also deserves praise. Less positive was the participation of Pedro Cunha, but the fault is not the actor but the way his character was thought. I just can&apos;t conceive how that character would behave so rebelliously.\n\nTechnically, the film has several merit points, starting with the choice of places for filming, in the beautiful city of Viana do Castelo, where the production managed to emulate period environments without major difficulties. The conception of costumes and also the choice of classic vehicles and cars used, seemed very careful to me, attentive to the details and determined to respect the aesthetics of the period. The soundtrack works well, although it is perhaps a little melodramatic and seems to be an attempt to imitate the soundtrack for the movie &quot;The Schindler&apos;s List&quot;. I don&apos;t like cinematography either, very gray, nebula and colorless.",

Also the gore effects are not that good. To make matters even worse, the previews on the DVD were almost as bad as the main movie. I heard there was going to be a part 2 to this mess. I don&apos;t know how. If this played in any theater it should be closed down. When I got suckered into renting this there was only one copy in the store.

So many of them harp on the fact that Alec Guinness was cast as the Japanese businessman who falls in love with Rosalind Russell&apos;s lonely Jewish widow. For that matter, some take exception to the casting of the Catholic Miss Russell as Mrs. Jacoby.\n\nIt&apos;s called acting, people! Mr. Guinness and Miss Russell certainly convinced me that they were these people - an elderly lonely Jewish widow and an equally elderly lonely Japanese widower who meet and, although from very different cultures, find a common ground.\n\nThis was a beautifully performed and profoundly moving story. I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ve managed to never see it before. It left me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. I will certainly be adding this film to my collection.",

In this first stage of his career Siegel worked as a kind of hired hand on numerous low budget films .In some cases he was forced to work with very standard material, nonetheless in some others Siegel worked with some of the finest scripts ever created such as the Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Killers. No worries whatsoever, if the basis are not that solid here ,Siegel had what it takes to left his mark and didn&apos;t need a super script to come out with an amazing films ,as he proved with the Line up or Private Hell 36. \n\nSadly foundations here are not that solid , indeed these are much much weaker . He was probably charged with the task of making a teenage movie in the vein of the Blackboard Jungle ,same as he was probably assigned to do in Riot in Block cell 11 .\n\nIn both cases he managed to succeed though working under disadvantageous circumstances: low budget , unoriginal plots with a moralistic tone which allows to see the what would be the end from minute one . Crime in the streets also had some clichés about juvenile delinquency.\n\nBut Siegel overcame aany inconveniences to provide a more than decent outcome . Characters are solid and well constructed, Cassavettes is very convincing as the leader of the gang and action flows smoothly , helped by the sense of realism that the director gives to the film, so overall not bad at all",

Yet, viewers are to find instead an oddly artistic film with what must be one of the most strangest ideas for a film in all the annals cinema.\n\nHere goes: a demon falls in love with a girl, but she perishes and his sadness infects a bed which then becomes indestructible and develops an insatiable appetite for for pretty much everything, flesh in particular. The soul of one of it&apos;s victims now haunts a painting and comments on the carnage the bed reeks. Weird enough for ya? Sloppy, cheap and very amateurish, the film is really hanging at the bottom rung of the budget/talent food chain. The acting is mostly nonexistent (except for the trapped soul, who is pretty good), the sound quality is rough and the picture is faded. Also, the editing needs some serious attention as the pacing for the film is all kinds of wrong.\n\nAnd yet, the film kept me watching all the way to the end. It wasn&apos;t the trashy 70&apos;s goods that held on to me (of which, there are actually very little), it was the controlled strangeness of the picture. Unlike many odd-concept/low-budget affairs, the film starts and stays weird, but keeps itself contained; it comes off more artistic than it does simply exploitive.\n\nTechnical limitations aside, the movie is interesting, if not all that entertaining. A less budget restricted remake would be nice, but try to take it for what it is.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;New Orleans&quot; started out as an Orson Welles project at RKO -- a Louis Armstrong biopic with Armstrong playing himself -- and it morphed through several different incarnations (including a version by writer Valentine Davies that ultimately got filmed as &quot;Syncopation&quot; in 1942) before ending up with producer Jules Levey as the film we have. There&apos;s certainly a sense of might-have-been about this movie that was only accentuated in the early 1980&apos;s when an independent jazz reissue label called Legends released the surviving pre-recordings made by Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday in October 1946 for use in the film -- including a treasure trove of music that hadn&apos;t made it anywhere near the final cut -- and the idea of basing a film about the history of jazz around a set of boring white characters and reducing the African-Americans to extras in their own story is all too familiar in Hollywood&apos;s treatment of just about any story involving African-based politics or culture.\n\nNow for the good news: within the horrible limits of the concept, the script is relatively well constructed, and Arthur Lubin&apos;s direction shows some visual imagination -- notably in the opening tracking shot through the streets of back-lot &quot;New Orleans&quot; before the camera enters Arturo de Cordova&apos;s cabaret/casino and discovers Louis Armstrong and his band playing &quot;West End Blues&quot; (inexplicably renamed &quot;Name-Your-Poison Blues&quot; in the film). In her autobiography &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; Billie Holiday vividly registered her disgust at being cast as a maid, and in the scenes with Dorothy Patrick she&apos;s visibly stiff, barely able to get the servile dialogue out of her mouth -- but when she shows up at the cabaret set and gets to sing with Armstrong&apos;s band she visibly loosens up and becomes a relaxed and quite effective screen presence. My partner noted the similarities between &quot;New Orleans&quot; and the 1936 MGM film &quot;San Francisco&quot; -- both are about gamblers who own night clubs and opera singers who climb down from their pedestals to perform popular music, and the (real) closure of New Orleans&apos; Storyville red-light district in 1917 fulfills the same climactic story function as the 1906 earthquake and fire did in &quot;San Francisco.&quot;\n\nThe first time I saw any part of &quot;New Orleans&quot; was at a screening of jazz movies in 1970, at which the host presented three numbers from the film (&quot;Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,&quot; &quot;Where the Blues Were Born in New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Storyville&quot;) that had been blown up from 8 mm sound prints released for home sales in France. The host said that the rest of the film had been lost, so it was quite surprising to me when I got to see the complete version twice in 1973 on an independent local TV station in the San Francisco Bay Area. Then I didn&apos;t see the film again until Kino released it on DVD, and having got over my disappointment at what it could have been, this time I could appreciate it for what it is: a flawed movie with an almost unbearably pretentious ending but still a quite entertaining film as well as a chance to see Armstrong and Holiday at the peak of their powers. (Woody Herman is hardly showcased to good effect even though he was leading perhaps the best band of his career, the &quot;First Herd,&quot; at the time.) And I&apos;m surprised the other commentator mentioning the greatest jazz movies left out my all-time favorite, Clint Eastwood&apos;s &quot;Bird.&quot;",

      "name": "Robin Williams should really stick to more serious roles like this.",
      "reviewBody": "I was completely stunned at how well Robin Williams pulled off more serious dramatic roles, since he&apos;s much more well-known for high-energy comedy. But his roles as the bad guy in movies like Insomnia or, even better, One Hour Photo display the extent of his acting abilities, since he is able to pull off such different characters so well. In Jakob the Liar, his comedic talents are restricted just enough so that he is able to function properly within the atmosphere of the movie, but is still allowed a scene or two in which his ability to get laughs can come out. He plays Jakob, a Jewish shopkeeper in a Nazi ghetto who tells a friend that he has a radio in order to prevent that friend from committing suicide.\n\nThings do not appear to be going well within the ghetto, the war seems like it will never end, and morale among the imprisoned Jews is steadily waning, resulting in suicides left and right. As Jakob finds a friend of his doing something that will certainly get him killed by the Nazis (this particular friend decided to make a ham-handed attempt at escape rather than overtly kill himself), Jakob runs to him and tells him that he heard on the radio that the Russians were closing in and would liberate them any day. His skeptical friend doubts him, so Jakob quickly tells him that he has a radio so that he will believe the Russians will be there to save them all soon, and his friend&apos;s suicide is prevented.\n\nBy the next morning, literally everyone in the ghetto knows that Jakob Heym has a radio, and so he is venerated like a God and constantly hounded about what the newest news is, and thus enters the main conflict of the movie. And speaking of which, one of the things that I really liked about the movie was the complexity of its conflict. It&apos;s a conflict that you sit there knowing what needs to happen for a happy ending and so you sit there and hope for that, because every option has terrible consequences.\n\nJakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can&apos;t let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN&apos;T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased. What he has to do, then, is walk the fine line between delivering lots of fictitious good news to the whole ghetto without letting the Nazis find out about it.\n\nThere is definitely something that needs to be said about the importance of a movie like this. Obviously, holocaust movies are nothing new, and different depictions of the holocaust have been especially in the spotlight since Roberto Benigni made a holocaust movie called Life Is Beautiful in 1997, at least half of which was a comedy. A lot of people felt that it was distasteful to present something as serious and tragic as the holocaust in such a light. And not just average moviegoers like me, either. Spielberg thought it was too lighthearted for such weighty subject matter, and from a certain point of view, he&apos;s right. On the other hand, however, the fact that you laughed during the film does not change the meaning of the war that it focuses on. The Nazis killed funny people, too.\n\nI read a review on the title page for Jakob the Liar here on the IMDb, where a reviewer who completely missed the boat on this movie criticized it for things like the comedic content, the behavior and presentation of the Jews of the ghetto, and the choice of Robin Williams for the role of Jakob Heym. To be perfectly honest, I can never understand people like that. The way I see it, as long as a movie takes the holocaust seriously then it should not be criticized for being a holocaust film that&apos;s not in the right format or that had an actor who has done too many comedy roles. This same reviewer, by the way, praised Life Is Beautiful, a spectacular film, as is Jakob the Liar.\n\nI can certainly understand that there are people who are touchy about the holocaust. It is inarguably one of the most tragic events in all of recorded human history, made even more tragic by the fact that it was perpetrated by humans against other humans. It&apos;s sickening. But there are no jokes about the holocaust in Jakob the Liar. The Jews do not act like victims. It is historically accurate and does not compromise the truth of what happened for the sake of entertainment. It presents a story of a ghetto full of captive Jews who have had their lives stolen from them and are desperate for some hope, and one man tries to help and inadvertently finds himself in a position to provide massive amounts of hope to them, but at massive risk to his own safety.\n\nSo if you don&apos;t like to see Robin Williams playing serious, dramatic roles (roles at which he is increasingly displaying his massive talent ), don&apos;t watch the movie! It is neither a secret that Williams is in the movie, nor that it&apos;s a serious role. One look at the cover box will tell you that. But if it&apos;s the holocaust being taken seriously that troubles you, maybe you should be more concerned about the fact that there are people, alive TODAY, here in the 21st Century, and presumably relatively educated American citizens, who DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE HOLOCAUST EVER EVEN HAPPENED. So like I said, if you&apos;re that concerned about the portrayal of the holocaust, maybe focus your efforts on these nutcases who have convinced themselves that the holocaust itself is just a fable. Maybe a myth that mothers started telling their kids to make them scared of Germans or some other such nonsense.\n\nJakob the Liar has no illusions, it takes a tragedy in human history and tells a story of a man who did what he could to help those suffering around him, and Robin Williams should obviously be commended for the power of his performance, as should the rest of the cast. The thing to keep in mind is that there is no certain perspective from which to view things like the holocaust. Everyone has different thoughts and feelings about it, and in the movies these different perspectives can be provided in different ways without compromising the severity and finality of the event itself. Jakob the Liar does not at all trivialize the holocaust in any way, what it does is honor the loss of its victims, who came from all walks of life.",

      "reviewBody": "In this Philippines-shot junkfest, Julia Montgomery portrays Sarah, an ambassador&apos;s daughter. It seems the country is in the midst of chaos and revolution (is it meant to be the Philippines?) and some armed marauders kill her beloved father and spirit her away into their terrorist training camp. The leader of these supposed revolutionaries is one Sanchez (Ruel Vernal), a sadistic taskmaster that beats, tortures, rapes and brainwashes Sarah. But there is more to the story, amazingly enough...\n\nMeanwhile, Rick (Memel) is a former soldier who just wants to escape his violent past and find peace. He lives with his wife on a tranquil rice farm and that&apos;s where he wants to stay. Unfortunately, when Rick&apos;s wife meets her end at the hands of Sanchez&apos;s comrades during yet another violent flare-up in the country, Rick and his stonewashed denim jacket vow revenge. Rick and Sarah team up (despite some reluctance at first, naturally) to defeat the Sanchez gang because they both have their own reasons for doing so. But will they ever achieve their sought-after savage justice? Sure, the movie is dumb and low-budget-looking, and it has all the silly blow-ups, laughable dubbing, and machine gun shooting you would expect, but what did you honestly think this would be? But it&apos;s not all brainless pap (just about 99%), because the movie takes an unexpected left turn when Sarah and Rick go to a Shaolin temple to pick up some monks to help them on their revenge mission. Seems like the obvious thing to do. They want the whole temple, but the Master says &quot;you may pick five&quot;. It&apos;s not explained why. Then Sarah, Rick and the five monks enter an abandoned city with spray paint everywhere. It is run by the midget Aldo (Hero Bautista), who resembles a carnival barker. The town is populated by children in strange, half-heartedly applied face paint. Think Gymkata&apos;s (1985) &quot;Town of the Crazies&quot; meets an Italian post-apocalyptic film. Strange indeed. Naturally it all comes to a head with the final showdown in the time-tested abandoned warehouse.\n\nDespite the fact that Willie Williams is on hand, and Julia Montgomery is reasonably attractive, and the mastermind behind it all is legendary Australian producer Antony Ginnane, the truth is that Savage Justice&apos;s run-of-the-mill stupidity is an obstacle it never really overcame.\n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",

I was 18 when the Seattle scene broke, so Pearl Jam became the soundtrack of my young adult years.\n\nI was a bit leery of this movie, as it could have really have turned me off the band depending on how it all went down. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole movie. The crowd singing the song &quot;Better Man&quot;, brought tears to my eyes. You really get an idea of how fast the band became huge, and the problems they had keeping their &quot;art&quot; rather than their business. I have gained a greater appreciation for this rock band, and it just made me a bigger fan\n\nSimply put, Pearl Jam &quot;10&quot; one of the greatest rock records ever, and Pearl jam &quot;20&quot; one of the greatest rock movies ever",

      "reviewBody": "I absolutely loved this family friendly cartoon because it made me laugh out loud! The animation in this movie is exquisite. It is so detailed that you can clearly see all the feathers on the birds and tiny waves of the ocean. When they show scenes of the town you can see the patch work on the houses and the real looking scenery. Each character is unique because the creative animation matches their personalities. \n\nThis movie is about, Red (Jason Sudeikis), a red bird who never fit in and has anger issues. One day, he has to go to an anger management class and meets the birds Bomb, Matilda, Chuck and Terence, and they all become friends.\n\nThen, pigs come to the island on an unexpected visit. They have parties with the birds and they give the birds weird gifts like trampolines and motorcycles and generally cause havoc in the town. A horrible turn of events happens and Red and all of the other birds need to save the day. \n\nMy favorite scene is when Red attends anger management class. Matilda, the instructor talks with all the birds about their issues. They participate in many funny exercises such as poetry writing and yoga. This is a funny scene. Red has the wrong attitude and is definitely negative and Matilda the instructor demonstrates some anger issues too. \n\nMy favorite character is Terence (Sean Penn), a giant red and black bird who doesn&apos;t really talk as much as he grunts. His facial expressions are particularly funny. Terence gets a lot of laughs from the audience and appears to be a crowd favorite. \n\nThe Angry Birds Movie is definitely a comedy. Almost every scene, even the sad ones, have funny lines. There is some humor that would make sense to older kids and adults but not little kids. There are some parts that some adults might not feel comfortable with some of the content. For example, when the pigs slap their butts and joke about reproducing.\n\nI rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because of the humor and recommend it for ages 4 to 18. It is a fun and silly animated movie about angry birds. Who doesn&apos;t love angry birds? If you like the game Angry Birds or just want to have a good laugh, then The Angry Birds Movie is the movie for you. It opens in theaters nationwide May 20, 2016 so, go check it out. \n\nReviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

      "reviewBody": "When I bought this movie from Amazon, I believed it to be a disaster movie in the likes of Hollywood movies such as &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;2012&quot; and such. And the cover and text on the back of the cover didn&apos;t really let on to what this movie was, it all just showed something of a typical disaster movie.\n\nSo I wasn&apos;t prepared for what was ahead. Also because I hadn&apos;t done any research of reviews prior to buying (and watching) the movie. So I was in for one big surprise. There are those rare moments when you stumble upon something truly unique by sheer luck, and this was one such moment for me.\n\n&quot;Aftershock&quot; blew me away. This movie is so much more than your average disaster movie. Sure there is a breathtakingly amazing disaster scene early on in the movie. And you just sit there with your hands clenched and biting your lip, because that whole part is so intense and so amazingly shot. It is like you are there right in the midst of the chaos. I will go as far as saying that the earthquake scene in this movie far outshines any of that I have seen in Hollywood disaster movies.\n\nBut &quot;Aftershock&quot; is not just a disaster movie, it is also a movie that has a very touching story to tell, a very sad and unfortunate story as well. But it tell its story in a very good way, without being too much. You really get immersed in the story, and it sweeps you off your feet and takes you along on an emotional roller-coaster ride. You might actually want to have some tissue at hand, because there are some very, very emotional scenes in this movie. It is also a story of emotions; a story of how our lives and fates can change in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe characters in &quot;Aftershock&quot; are very believable and they are so well portrayed on the screen by the actors and actresses. Each and every of the main characters are given so much room to grown and develop that you really get to feel with them, grow with them, feel their sadness, loss and happiness. And for this, the director was right on the money. This story was so well-told and well-shot that it is hard not to get caught up in the moment.\n\nThe 130 minutes that the movie is in length doesn&apos;t feel that long, because you get so caught up in the movie. I didn&apos;t leave the screen for a single moment. I just sat there mesmerized, wanting to see what happened next, what would happen to Fang Deng, Fang Da and everyone else.\n\nI am a big fan of Asian cinema, though I had never heard about this movie prior to finding it by sheer luck on Amazon. Now that I have seen it, &quot;Aftershock&quot; will stay with me for a long, long time. It was one of the most emotional and honest stories I have had the pleasure of witnessing in a long, long time.\n\nEven if you are not a fan of Asian cinema or have a phobia of watching movies in a foreign language, you should overcome that and do yourself the pleasure of sitting down to watch this movie, because it is really worth it. This movie is truly an amazing one, and it the story is one that deserves to be told.",

      "reviewBody": "This stand-up comedy special made me realize something; I can probably become a rich, popular and famous comedian as well! Because if it&apos;s so easy to make an audience laugh with so little funny moments or good jokes, everybody can be a comedian I guess.\n\nSeems that Jeff Dunham is only known and popular thanks to his use of puppets. At first this was still being something really original and new but it is getting old already by now. Jeff Dunham still would had been OK with me if only he was able to write some more clever and funny material to go along with his gimmick.\n\nReally the problem with this show is that it&apos;s just shockingly not funny at all. None of the writing or any of the jokes are ever being clever ones. Every joke and reply is incredibly predictable and incredibly unfunny because of this. Seems to me that Dunham wrote this show on one rainy afternoon at the kitchen-table and just wrote down everything that first came up into his head and wrote it down, without trying to further expand on it or try to give some twists or in-depth jokes to any of his material.\n\nStill incredibly amazing to see how the crowd is still cracking up as if it&apos;s the funniest thing they had ever heard or seen in their lifetime. Where did they get this people from? This guy should had been booed of the stage the first moment he was telling a lame and predictable joke. Its their fault other people now can see this 85 minutes of &apos;comedy&apos; torture on DVD or TV.\n\nBut the audience are not the only persons manically laughing. Dunham himself also cracks up lots of times when he is either telling a story or doing a routine with one of his puppets. This however seemed forced and just not naturally to me and more was a trick to get the audience laughing as well. The guitar guy gets used in the same way. He laughs and looks surprised every time a puppet makes a remark or says something &apos;funny&apos; or offensive, like he doesn&apos;t known the material and this is the first time he ever heard any of it.\n\nSo perhaps it helps to see Jeff Dunham more as a ventriloquist than as a stand-up comedian. But sorry, he is not even very good at that. It&apos;s obvious and distracting how he is moving his mouth at times and his puppets are mostly being just like his material; stupid and predictable. Each one of his many puppets is basically being very stereotypical and therefor also very easy to write for. Walter is a grumpy old guy, so it doesn&apos;t matter what he says, as long as it&apos;s being something grumpy. It also doesn&apos;t matter much what Achmed says, as long as he says &apos;Silence, I kill you!&apos; every now and then. Bubba J is a stupid Southerner, so he needs to say something NASCAR or beer related every now and then. José Jalapeño is your very stereotypical Mexican and Peanut is, well, being a peanut. Peanut is perhaps the most creative puppet Dunham created but I have no idea anymore what any of his material was ever about, since I had already lost complete interest in this once Peanut made his entrance. Some people even call Dunham racist because his puppets are being big stereotypes and often make racist remarks but I just call it lack of talent and creativity and the only offensive thing about it is that it&apos;s not being anything funny at all.\n\nA very special Christmas special indeed...\n\n2/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "With a pair of films under his belt, including the well-received The Parson&apos;s Widow, Carl Th. Dreyer set out to make a movie akin to D. W. Griffith&apos;s Intolerance, a huge series of interrelated stories in an anthology, spanning millennia. While Dreyer&apos;s third film doesn&apos;t reach the highs of Griffith&apos;s masterpiece, ultimately being fairly uneven, there&apos;s more than enough here to recommend it. This is a hugely ambitious work with often striking visuals and an interesting throughline that centers around an interesting recurring character.\n\nThe four stories are the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, a monk giving up his unrequited love to the Spanish Inquisition, a servant becoming a Revolutionary leader and betraying the aristocratic family he&apos;s helped hide, and a Finnish woman being forced to choose between her family and her part in the fight against the Bolsheviks. Out of these four, the first is the best, the most beautiful visually, and the most consistently acted. The least of the four is the last, which introduces too many characters for too short of a story and ends up just kind of confused as to what its overall purpose is. The Spanish Inquisition section feels remarkably like Dreyer&apos;s later The Passion of Joan of Arc, at least in storytelling focus, and is actually quite good. The third in the French Revolution is pretty good, bringing in Marie Antoinnette as a sympathetic figure who&apos;s supposed to mirror the plight of the aristocratic family the Chambords.\n\nThrough all four of these stories is Satan himself, and Dreyer takes an interesting take. Inspired somewhat by the tale of Job, Satan is viewed as a tool of God, sent to Earth to tempt mankind away from God where each soul he successfully turns away from God adds 100 years to his punishment while every soul he fails to turn away removes 1,000 years from his sentence. Satan pursues his mission with grim dedication, moving through the centuries in different guises (a Pharisee, the Grand Inquisitor, a Revolutionary official, and a Bolshevik officer), accomplishing his mission without any joy in it. His every success takes him further into human history to corrupt, away from God&apos;s Grace, while his only success is a tragedy of death.\n\nHowever, as interesting as Satan&apos;s part is in the story, one thing I wish could change about the film is the explicit nature of Satan himself. He&apos;s played by the same actor in all four segments (Helge Nissen), but he wears so much makeup from one to the other that without the direct pointing out of him by intertitles his renewed presence would get lost on all but the most eagle-eyed viewers. I wish Dreyer had kept his appearance largely uniform across all the tales, and just shown this singular figure appearing in every tale, tempting humanity with maybe a reveal at the end that he was Satan, though I feel like the title of the film would have been evidence enough of whom he was.\n\nThe other problem I have to the film can be exemplified by the over-reliance on intertitles, especially in the final section. The Finnish part is about a husband and wife who manage a telegraph for the White Mensheviks. Their neighbor wants the wife for his own and turns to the Soviets in order to throw the husband in jail and allow him to have the wife. There&apos;s also another woman who watched the Soviets murder her father and wants to join the White army with little sense of anything other than vengeance. The focus ends up being the wife in the end, but the man who betrays is a large focus for a large amount of time, and Satan&apos;s part ends up feeling confused. There&apos;s a lot going on here, and the film has to rely heavily on intertitles to explain who&apos;s who and what&apos;s what. Coming two hours into a nearly three hour film, my patience was running thin on the vast amounts of exposition necessary in intertitles just to get this story going, and the addition of the girl going to war, who ends up playing a part in the story&apos;s finale that could have been largely interchangeable with any other background character, just adds to the frustration.\n\nThat being said, the section around Jesus is the best thing Dreyer had made up to that point, and the Spanish Inquisition section is a close second. The advantage these two sections have is that the first is one of the best known stories in the world so there&apos;s little need for lots of intertitles dragging the film down explaining things, and the second is so straightforward that it can largely play on its own after a certain point without needing lots of explanation.\n\nThis is also where Dreyer is coming into his own as a visual stylist. There are compositions from beginning to end that feel so much more than just setting up a camera on a tripod and letting a scene play out. There&apos;s a heavy use of irises to highlight subjects in frame, interesting compositions that highlight individual characters, and heavy uses of shadows that feel German inspired. He had also taken many lessons from Griffith, much more than just the idea of an anthology film through time. There&apos;s a very strong use of intercutting action that helps create a genuine sense of excitement at time, as well as use in the third section that helps draw the comparisons between Antoinette and the Chambords.\n\nThis is an ambitious film from a young director that took him two years to make. It&apos;s not a perfect film at all, ending far less well than it starts, but there&apos;s a very strong sense of visual composition, thematic purpose, and clarity of narrative that it represents Dreyer overreaching his grasp, but only so much. There&apos;s really compelling stuff in this film, and it represents the continued growth of the young Danish filmmaker.",

The Director Justin Theroux was at the showing and answered some questions and he said some interesting things. First the whole movie was done on a 1M dollar budget and they shot it in 23 days. \n\nAs for the movie, it was a very different movie from the music to the cinematography with a fresh taste to it. The main character Henry Roth played by Billy Crudup was an amazing role. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to hear awards galore for Crudup. Equally as impressive was Mandy Moore, I expected very little out of Moore but she delivered an amazing performance that will surprise many and officially launch her acting career, and establish her as a top talent. \n\nIt&apos;s a story of mental disorders and people falling in love in unlikely circumstances. At times it can get scary as the writer does an amazing job of keeping you guessing. It&apos;s without an amazing movie and I&apos;d recommend it to anybody.",

      "reviewBody": "I will say that the synopsis for the 2008 South Korean crime action movie &quot;Mubangbi-Dosi&quot; (aka &quot;Open City&quot;) definitely sounded interesting. And with this being an Asian movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I had to watch it.\n\nWriter and director Sang-Gi Lee managed to put together a fair enough script here. However, &quot;Mubangbi-Dosi&quot; wasn&apos;t exactly an outstanding movie experience. Sure, it was watchable enough for what it was, but it was hardly a memorable movie.\n\nThe movie starts out well enough, but somewhere after the midway point it starts to stagnate a bit. And the ending of the movie just felt forced and rushed, and it made very little sense that the main character would just up and do such a drastic change. It didn&apos;t really follow the tone of the movie up to that point.\n\nThe acting performances in &quot;Mubangbi-Dosi&quot; were fair enough. They had some interesting and good talents on the cast list, with the likes of Son Ye-Jin and Kim Byeong-Ok.\n\nI didn&apos;t feel that I had been missing out on a particular gem in the South Korean cinema here, as I only got to watch &quot;Mubangbi-Dosi&quot; for the first time here in 2023. I had actually never heard about the movie prior to sitting down and watching it.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Mubangbi-Dosi&quot; lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",

Instead, I was pointing my fingers all throughout the movie to my TV, cursing the bad storyline and the annoying characters (which were either too stupid, too naive, too annoying, and too cranky). At some points it was so bad, I have to fast-forward the DVD just to get by. Yep, that&apos;s how bad it got.\n\nA bit of advice, if you&apos;re in the mood for some horror chills, for the love of Rosemary&apos;s Baby, don&apos;t watch this movie. Unless, you were feeling a little down and thinking that you were the stupidest person in the planet, then please watch this movie.

Therefore I won&apos;t spill more words than necessary to warn you all not giving this movie any chance for watching. You most likely will regret watching this, so ignore it and all forthcoming stuff from Zhou, students of any film academy do it so much better. It was like my toes couldn&apos;t relax in my socks and stayed frozen until the last minute. I was shocked how bad this movie was and I couldn&apos;t believe my own eyes. But I kept watching and I couldn&apos;t avoid many laughs... Probably a cartoon version would have been even more fun. And what a waste of money and time. Maybe re-education of all Chinese masters involved in this production could be a solution? And ignore all positive reviews here, as they are the proof of a bad taste.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember reading reviews, some quite negative, about Chris Waitt&apos;s film and I think a few might not have got the conceit; the film is more of a mockumentary, with the audience laughing with and at Waitt; it is the comedy of embarrassment rather than a genuine examination of romantic relationships.\n\nFirst of all, I&apos;d like to put on record that Waitt comes across as a fundamentally good-natured, if lazy, shambling shaggy-dog of a man (shaggy dog story), essentially quite lovable. Compared to the way some men treat women, Waitt is not that bad a person: his main faults appear to be laziness and a lack of commitment.\n\nAs the film progressed, it became obvious that a lot of the scenes had been set-up (his exasperated producers, a blind-date) and too many of the people inhabit Waitt&apos;s media world making you doubt its veracity (one ex is an actress, he ends up finding love with a journalist). It is a piece of guerilla/gonzo film making with the film-maker&apos;s mother becoming a character, exasperated at her son&apos;s feckless behaviour, with her pithy comments.\n\nThe first girlfriend, it is eventually revealed, was from Waitt&apos;s childhood (eleven), so completely undercutting the adult conversation and our expectations. I don&apos;t doubt many of Waitt&apos;s former girlfriends refused to appear, but maybe that was more to do with appearing on film than with Waitt himself. The scene with the girlfriend hidden in a hotel room and then giving her scathing comments via a machine obscuring her voice came across as comedic as did the encounter with an ex- in the Indian restaurant; it emerges that since Waitt, she has only gone out with Asian men. It then becomes obvious that the film is sending up both Waitt and romance as he pushes things to the extreme.\n\nHalfway through the film, I began to lose interest and decided to catch up the highlights of the Football League Show on another channel before catching the end of the film. It isn&apos;t serious enough to deserve full attention.\n\nThe film does end on a more serious, optimistic note. At the beginning of the film, one ex-girlfriend from his teenage years is asked what she learnt from the end of their relationship and she replies about learning to do things differently and,in a sense, this is the lesson Waitt learns as well as appreciating a former girlfriend and the love she felt for him.\n\nThe film is faintly reminiscent of John Cusack&apos;s role in Nick Hornby&apos;s &apos;High Fidelity&apos;, (a more conventionally structured and narrative driven account) also punctuated with moments of embarrassing comedy (the ex-girlfriend traumatised from the break-up).",

      "reviewBody": "Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.\n\nIt&apos;s the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy&apos;s bedroom find themselves in fear of what&apos;s to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...\n\n&quot;You&apos;ll never be outgrown, or neglected,&quot; the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). &quot;Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into &quot;Watership Down&quot;, but there&apos;s always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Sid&apos;s hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.\n\nThis time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying &quot;We were made for each other&quot;. Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl&apos;s toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, &quot;an accessory, a purse with legs.&quot; The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. &quot;We do a lot of improv here,&quot; another toy tells him.\n\nAll this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.\n\nSet against this is Woody&apos;s firm if shaken resolution to &quot;be there for Andy&quot;, even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It&apos;s a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they&apos;ll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn&apos;t very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It&apos;s a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t leave you on a down note, but it&apos;s a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. This time, I appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before I got out of my chair. It still felt good, though.",

Set in the outback we see our hapless hero teaming with a grizzled hunter who has history with porky and fending off two local miscreants who are more of a threat throughout than the beasty itself.\n\nOur piggy is barely on screen and when it is it&apos;s generally ultra close up shots of its tusks/nose at no point do you really get a proper look at it and I&apos;m sure the reasons for this are pretty obvious.\n\nThe plot is bland, it never reels you in. You never feel the threat of this creature, you&apos;re more annoyed by the other pair of antagonists who are just dreadful! And our lead? He couldn&apos;t have been anymore bland if they tried, awful awful character.\n\nRazorback is not an 80&apos;s classic, it&apos;s a movie kept afloat in peoples mind by the power of nostalgia.\n\nRants\n\nOh Arkie, what could have been? There was a young talented actress with a successful career on the up! What a dreadful shame, so incredibly young, she hadn&apos;t even hit 40 before falling. I&apos;d have loved to see how her career would have inevitably blossomed.\n\nThe Good\n\nArkie Whiteley\n\nThe Bad\n\nWeak creature effects Awful finale Bland leading man Antagonist humans were simply too annoying Fails to engage the viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. I made a point to attend the opening night of the film as its subject, Buck Brannaman, was slated to hold an audience Q&amp;A after the film. Unfortunately, he was running a bit late, so we only got about 8 minutes of his time. Still, this remarkable man made an impression ... an impression of authenticity and realism. He may perform a &quot;show&quot;, but his is no &quot;act&quot;.\n\nThe inspiration for, and technical adviser on, the film &quot;Horse Whisperer&quot;, Buck Brannaman explains early in the film that a horse views a human tossing a saddle on his back much the way he would view a lion attack. Such is the manner in which this man makes his points to the eager and often doubting horse owners who attend his clinics. Buck then proceeds to win over horse and human alike with wit, strength, character, kindness and toughness.\n\nFirst time documentarian Cindy Meehl does a decent job of presenting the similarities of horse training and child-rearing. Buck&apos;s philosophy stems from the earlier work of Tom Dorrance and Ray Hunt, but is further influenced by the less-than-stellar parenting tactics of his father. Buck and his brother Bill (stage name Smokie) were child rodeo stars who performed rope tricks under the firm hand of their dad. It is clear from the footage that they feared their father. In an unlikely twist of fate, the boys are rescued from the abusive environment thanks to the actions of a football coach and deputy sheriff. To fully understand the brave actions of these two men, one must take into account the normal custom in rural America of minding one&apos;s own business. These men didn&apos;t do that and Buck was given a new life.\n\nWatching a quick clip of the &quot;old&quot; horse training techniques really brings home Buck&apos;s more gentle and understanding style. He stresses the importance of understanding the horse and being clear with one&apos;s affection and intentions. His flag waving and lead rope actions can win over a horse in a short time. The surprising part is that the horse&apos;s owner learns every bit as much as their horse. Buck is clear in that the issue with most &quot;problem&quot; horses can be tracked right back to the owner. The same can be said for most kids. Just as he says trying to bribe a horse with carrots and sugar leads to a spoiled, unresponsive horse, the same argument can be made for that type of parenting approach.\n\nThe frustrating part of the film is that it doesn&apos;t really climb inside the head of Buck. We see a glimpse of a man who has overcome childhood atrocities, but we also see a man who loves his family ... yet spends months at a time away from them. We see fire in his eyes as he addresses a horse owner who has the gall to keep 17 studs in her pasture. It&apos;s obvious he fights his own demons towards those who mistreat animals, yet as he lectures we wonder if his care is really for the horse more than the person. It was also strange that no real mention of his brother was provided in the film. We could say it&apos;s none of our business, but the film brings up the issue of childhood and then leaves us hanging on the brother.\n\nTruly the inspiration to Buck&apos;s turnaround is his foster mother. She lights up the screen as she talks about Buck as a child and cracks wise with her observations and the telling of a joke. Her love for Buck is obvious and we hope he realizes just how fortunate he is to have had her in his life.\n\nThis is an inspirational man who is making a difference in the lives of people and horses. He has overcome childhood obstacles to make the world a better place. His cowboy philosophy is pretty simple. Everyone carries some darkness and baggage, and we can all make our own choices on whether to let that affect our value and enjoyment in life.",

It&apos;s how each deals with his or her issue that makes things interesting in life. And when those issues interrelate to family dynamics, things can get down right convoluted, both as tragic and comic. &quot;Please Give&quot; is such a vehicle. Everyone&apos;s issue is not only personal but becomes a family matter at some level. And in the end there is some truth to the concept that blood is thicker than water. Like the movie &quot;Crash&quot; we see how seemingly random personal issues bounce off of the others in our lives, how we react to the consequences given our relative family dynamics, and how we may move on. In the center of this mini-maelstrom is Kate, whose issue of guilt appears to be the nucleus of all matters. Everything seems to spread out from there, and like a galaxy in the distant sky, things coalesce or spin off into directions brilliantly. As usual, whoever makes up the trailer for this tidy package misdirects us completely, which is why I hate trailers.....",

The story is very predictable and it took lot of patience from me to watch the entire movie. Nag&apos;s performance can at the most be said to be average. The only good points in the movie was Rahul Dev,Raghuvaran&apos;s Acting an a couple of good songs by Devi Sri Prasad. The action part of the movie is also decent. \n\nThe trend of choreographers becoming directors may not be healthy. Prabhu Deva had started this and others have followed suit. I am very surprised how this movie became a success. 100 days in 74 centers!!! Unbelievable.\n\nTo make the whole thing clear, this movie can be watched once and that too only if you are completely jobless on a weekend.",

Schary brought his penchant for reality with him starting with Battleground and once more here again. The star of the first is the star of the latter and by that I mean Van Johnson. This movie is about the Korean war which in the movie is referred to as a police action because an official war was never declared. True story taken from the Saturday Evening Post tells the tale of bomber planes on a Naval tanker during the war. It is very matter of fact with little plot but the lives of the men and their difficulty destroying a rail track that just seems to get rebuilt every time. Walter Pidgeon provides good support as the commander and everyone else is just fine and a thirty minute rescue scene is so impressive, it makes you wonder if this people had not been watching the Europen movies; the droll delivery, the spacial pacing, the voice over that is a third character, the actual footage of attacks because any attack or firing is actual footage. Fine movie all around that needs to be seen by more.",

      "reviewBody": "I think it is very hard in general to make a &quot;based on a true story&quot; sort of film, that alone can clamp a pretty heavy anchor to your ankles. Moreso when that true story is one that means a lot to you as Ed Harris has said about Jackson Pollock&apos;s biography.\n\nBased upon those precepts, I feel Harris succeeded, however I cannot say this film is an unqualified success. It is sprawling, but unlike Pollock...for cinema circulation, Harris could not stretch his canvas so wide. He gets over two hours here...but I suspect he could have filled six easily.\n\nBased upon early buzz when this came out,  including the snippet shown at the Oscars for Marcia Gay Harden, I had trepidation that this would be reduced to a shout and spittle film; that the rage and angst of Pollock and Krasner would be the story. Certainly this is one aspect presented, but not the sole one.\n\nInterestingly to me, it seemed that the more halcyon Pollock&apos;s life was, the better his exploration of his art. I went in expecting that alcohol-oiled turmoil would be presented as the key to complicated creation. An artist must suffer and so on.\n\nThis shows that while I was familiar with Pollock, I was not that familiar. I could recognize his later chaotic, laced and dripped paintings...but I did not know anything about his personal life.\n\nBut in the course of two hours, I did enjoy...\n\n1) Seeing a progression in Pollock&apos;s paintings. I had not seen many of his earlier works that had more blocks to them, that were more easily seen as assemblages of images. The way these were filmed, in the act of creation was well done here. Same is true for the latter works. \n\n 2) The importance of Pollock&apos;s family. I loved seeing his Mother come to the openings. I did not know that two other brothers also painted; Sande alone seems to understand Jackson&apos;s talent and torment. Their relationship could have made a film of its own. \n\n3) Jeffrey Tambor&apos;s portrayal of Clem, a critic/king-maker of sorts. Us posters here, run the risk of being posers as well. And I think the best of us realize how subjective our comments are, a function of when we watch films, and who we are with, or how we are feeling as much as the films themselves. \n\n4) Following on that notion, to me one thread of &quot;Pollock&quot; is how the circle of critics destroys artists with either persecution or praise. It is not a revelation, that much art is highly personal, both for the purveyor, but painfully so for the artists. Not a revelation, but still worth repeating... \n\nWhen we see Pollock &quot;drunk&quot; on his ascent, reading from an Italian magazine during a family reunion, that really got to me. Maybe that was more dangerous than alcohol. Even if that critical acceptance is not essential, eating is. Another thread alluded to in this film, how to &quot;work&quot; and to live as an artist.\n\nThat scene also drove home the obsessive nature of being an artist, how it is hard at the same time to be a brother, or uncle, husband or perhaps impossible to be a father. Thus that obsession helps to contrast Sande and Jackson, and certainly sets up the power of Marcia Gay Harden&apos;s performance. Krasner too is an artist,  who has had some success. She retains her name, and her dreams, but fully embraces Pollock, and Pollock&apos;s artwork. Her support of him, while aware of her limits, was presented without martyring her. She was not a saint wandering into Pollock&apos;s hell. \n\n5) Talking to an artist about his/her obsession is problematic. They are already communicating in their chosen medium, and presumably they are communicating that way as it is easier than using words. I thought the interview with Life magazine in this film, and Pollock&apos;s notion of viewing his art as one views a field of flowers helped me. Maybe that was obvious to others, I think that way in music/sound...but in art too often I am hunting for images, for mirrors to our world.\n\nThe radio interview that Pollock conducted, halting and awkward could have underscored the travails of talking about art, or it seemed like he was trying to read from a manifesto of sorts (perhaps in real life one exists). Finally, the documentary film is painted as an undoing of Pollock. Fascinating as we ourselves are watching a film about Pollock. It&apos;s as if Ed Harris the actor in character could be talking to Ed Harris the film auteur.\n\nThe documentary film was to Pollock, what a zoo can be to a wild animal. The habitat corrupts the inhabitant. How Pollock puts on his shoes, when he&apos;s done painting, all control is lost...the private process made public, is made impure.\n\nNo, that&apos;s not the point to this film. If you are looking for a film with one tidy point, go elsewhere. But for an abridged but admirable biopic on Jackson Pollock, with many tangled and tantalizing threads...this is one to rent. And now a book for me to read. Rarely do I watch the deleted scenes and wish they had been in the film, as I did in this case.\n\nThere was a great shot early in the film where Pollock is pacing before the mural commissioned by Peggy Guggenheim. From the plot, we know he&apos;s worried about looms before him, and we get eerie shots of his shadow projected on the empty canvas to reinforce that. Harris too may have felt this was an ominous undertaking, I hope he pleased himself as he did me.\n\n7/10",

The chemistry between the leads is good, although the star here is the heroine. She&apos;s got charm and charisma, a sort of wholesomeness that&apos;s perfect for the role, and just enough sass to not make her boring. The plot is fun, with just the right comedic turns, and it moves along at a good pace. I liked that it was never shy to point out the weirdness of the setup and to poke fun at it. It&apos;s got a good blend of romance and comedy, but more comedy than the former. I didn&apos;t particularly care for the side characters, but our main couple was enough to keep me hooked and watching until the end. They&apos;re friends, first and foremost, and that really shone through."

      "reviewBody": "Remember the first 40 minutes of the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; in which the surviving team of a spacecraft explore the desert-like environment of the mysterious planet wherein they crash? (It was the best part of the movie, except for the very end). Okay, imagine that scenario for an entire 84 minute flick, albeit WITHOUT notable actors, great soundtrack and first-rate filmmaking; not to mention replace the apes with dinosaurs. If you can picture that, and it sounds like your cup of java, you might want to pick up &quot;Planet of the Dinosaurs.&quot;\n\nThis film is so amateurishly done on most levels that the average person would likely rate it pretty low. I grant it 5/10 Stars, however, for five reasons:\n\n\n* The picture was filmed at Vasquez Rocks, Northeast of Los Angeles (I visited this park in July of 2003). If you&apos;re not in the know, this location is where many of the original Star Trek episodes where filmed, such as &quot;Arena&quot; wherein Captain Kirk fights the Lizardman. \n\n\n\n* The stop-motion dinosaur animation is very good for the time period and, I hear, won some kind of an award when the film was released in the late &apos;70s. It&apos;s pretty much on a par with &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; \n\n\n\n* There are four (count &apos;em, four) female survivors of the space wreck and two of them are babes (the other two aren&apos;t that bad either, that is, if you&apos;re stranded on a deserted planet). One beauty unfortunately gets eaten almost immediately, but the other survives for quite awhile. The latter, by the way, appears to be of Native American ancestry and her tight outfit shows off her midrift and bellybutton the entire stint she appears in the film. And, trust me, if you have any doubt that American Indian women can be truly beautiful, you need to see this fine piece of womanhood. \n\n\n\n* After the first 20-30 minutes I was able to mentally adjust and accept the film&apos;s limitations; I strangely started to get into the story at this point and even care about the characters. \n\n\n\n* Lastly, this is definitely not a kiddy flick, nor is it goofy, comedic or even campy. It&apos;s a serious sci-fi story.\n\n\nIf &quot;Planet of the Dinosaurs&quot; had better actors, sound, music and worked out various other kinks in the story, direction, etc. I would give it a higher rating.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It&apos;s worth picking up if (like me) you&apos;re a sucker for Sci-fi survival-on-deserted-planet type flicks. Just keep in mind it&apos;s strictly Grade Z and mental adjustments will have to be made to appreciate it.\n\n&quot;Planet of the Dinosaurs&quot; has garnered a worthy &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; spot in the cult/independent film section of my video library.\n\nGRADE: C+",

The ghost of a death schoolmate makes her appearance to unwrap a story with the most pure terror style. The movie it&apos;s great and although it follows the typical pattern of movies made during those times, it stills being frightening. It also shows a great perspective of the Mexican society and with the scene of the striptease, I believe that it goes a little beyond the times when it was released. Whether you like Mexican movies or not this movie proves that although the lack of resources which it was made, at least we can say that we have a great horror ancient film, a genre that isn&apos;t common at all in this industry.",

There&apos;s loneliness and loss here, but it&apos;s covered in a way that makes you just fall in love with the characters and care for them, hope they come through. For those that can identify with the vib of New York, the film is likely to be appreciated even more, as elements of the subway and streets come through realistically.\n\nThis movie visits the lives of three different people, and how they coincidentally intermingle within the movie time line. The other characters in the movie add some color and background, and do well also.\n\nI&apos;ve watched this movie multiple times and every time I come away satisfied, and more so: inspired. You can use this movie to better your life, to better your art. Strongly recommend watching it on a quiet, relaxing night.",

Even when 10 to 15 trimming will make it almost perfect; you cannot stop watching it.\n\nTil Schweiger (who also directs and produce) is more a tormented man than a killer machine. He can carry the movie easily; but Moritz Bleibtreu is who really steal the movie even in a very short part.\n\nLuna Schweiger (Til&apos;s real life daughter ) is quite credible as the girl; but we never see her as a truly rebel as originally depicted.\n\nIn brief; it is not a great movie; but not a &quot;macho&quot; movie either.

He brought public lighting and paving stones to Madrid. But measures tending to encourage a rational, modern, hygienic, peaceful mode of living were generally resented by the very conservative lower classes, under the influence, it was believed, of reactionary clerical elements, especially the Jesuits, who were said to oppose every attempt at modernisation. One of the results of the Esquilache riots was the eventual expulsion of the Jesuit order from Spain and her vast colonial Empire.\n\nAll these political and existential conflicts are made very clear in this beautifully produced and interesting semi-documentary, a model of what such films can be.",

      "reviewBody": "A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn&apos;t happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she&apos;s not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn&apos;t work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.\n\nAlice is back and she&apos;s carrying a child, she couldn&apos;t be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back and he&apos;s not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again. Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well that&apos;s what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy&apos;s childhood was like and that maybe that&apos;s the one thing that can defeat him.\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don&apos;t think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Just the story was really silly, I mean it could have possibly worked, but once again, it was just executed the wrong way. I know that if you&apos;re looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I really wouldn&apos;t recommend it, it&apos;s not worth it, at least in my opinion.\n\n3/10",

Who do these filmmakers think they are...........Americans? As a Turkish-American, I am perhaps one of the few people who can criticize the output of films from both countries. After great recent films like &quot;Uzak-Distant&quot; and &quot;Hajar,&quot; it seemed like the Turkish industry had completely divorced itself from its infamous past and Cuneyt Arkin&apos;s films were ones in which people could only watch after a six-pack of Efes Pilsens. But, &quot;Buyu,&quot; which was sent to me by a Turkish friend from Australia is indeed a reminder that bad- truly bad films can still be made in Turkey. The film is predictable, boring and the special effects are woeful. &quot;Buyu&quot; also features shameless sexism and absolutely sick sequences, such as women being raped by spirits-no, I&apos;m not making that up! The acting is really awful. The directing is even worse. And, the editing is truly pathetic. I just hope they don&apos;t make a sequel!",

      "reviewBody": "The long-awaited film adaptation of Gudrun Pausewang&apos;s 1988 bestseller, lives up to readers and critics expectations alike. As in the novel, the teenaged protagonists take centre-stage in the cautionary antinuclear tale. The focus remains so fixedly on our young heroine and her troubled beau, that, were it not for the occasional shot of the brooding dark cloud moving at breakneck pace across the idyllic German countryside, we would likely forget the nuclear catastrophe, and relegate it to the position of initiator of events, rather than overriding drama.\n\nThe film&apos;s sentimentality is given carte blanche, as teenage angst is substituted and validated with abstract and scientifically incorrect fears and assertions about the safety of atomic energy. Being put on par with national if not global energy policy, the horror-drama of the characters situations forces our sympathy, and by the end of the film, we find our selves wanting to scream out: &quot;It would have all worked out, were it not for those dratted power plants!&quot; Not to deny that nuclear catastrophes have an individual human cost, but they also have a mass human cost, a catastrophe can only be shown to be such, when the universalising magnitude of its scale is shown. &quot;Die Wolke&quot;, gives us a gaggle of teenagers with whom we identify no more than any other group of acne-poppers whose fragile lives are thrown out of balance on Sunday afternoon television.\n\nViewers cold, utilitarian, opinions are countered with a brand of Dickensian humanism with an agenda. The film is prefaced in many cinemas with a reductionist piece of sensationalism, namely advertising by Greenpeace. Greenpeace are an action group, yes, but Greenpeace energy is a privately owned energy provider. This introduction leaves a bitter taste in the viewers mouth that does not abate, but tends to get surge up again, whenever the films characters utter one of their newly wise energy policy statements &quot;Nuclear energy, we should have got rid of it years ago!&quot; &quot;And switched to Greenpeace,&quot; was all that was ringing in this critics ears.\n\nIn Regensburg&apos; s Ostentor Cinema, a Q and A session (heavily focusing on the A) was held after the film. Invited were a political figure, a doctor specialising in catastrophe medicine, the organiser of the Evangelisches Bildungswerk and a judge turned politico. While they all agreed the film lacked scientific consultation, they all proceeded to use it as a platform to float their differing opinions. The panicked audience rattled off questions as to what they were to do in case of nuclear catastrophe, &quot;The opposite of what they do in the film!&quot; was the popular response. While increased cancer rates were shown in the following years, only two people died from the direct explosion and radiation in Tschernobyl. The majority of the deaths among those 30- 40,000 expected to die following a nuclear catastrophe result from unrest in the fleeing population.\n\nIf panic is the overriding sentiment following a change in nuclear policy, such as might be produced by a major meltdown in the reactor of power plant, then it is no great leap to assume that panic is also the overriding sentiment in the depiction of nuclear energy in film.",

      "reviewBody": "What can I say? The movie did not live up to the promise of its opening scene. It&apos;s well-shot and nicely lit, with a few postcard-perfect views of Tokyo, but the story makes no sense, the characters are poorly written, and Sergi Lopez is horribly miscast as the male lead. The ending is a formulaic cop-out.\n\nThe trailer tries to sell the movie as a sex thriller, which it&apos;s most decidedly not. It&apos;s a tale of two lost souls in a big city who try to find solace in each other, but fail, for various reasons.\n\nRinko Kikuchi performs well as a quiet fish market worker who moonlights as a paid assassin, but her character remains an enigma throughout the movie, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect or empathize with her. She bares her body more than once in fairly explicit sex scenes - and what a nice body it is - one only wishes the director could give us similar insight into her soul.\n\nSergi Lopez does his usual macho strut with a hint of menace which might have worked in a different movie, but feels utterly out of place in an upscale wine merchant from modern-day Tokyo. He is very unconvincing as Rinko&apos;s love interest, and is further hindered by his corpulent, scary hairy physique and significant age difference with his co-star. I could not for the life of me believe in chemistry between the two of them.\n\nThe omnipresent narrator, an older sound engineer who maintains chaste friendship with Rinko&apos;s character and gives the movie its title, is the most sympathetic of all, but he is more of a convenient voice-over device than a fully-fleshed character. Other parts are one-dimensional at best.\n\nRecommended only for indiscriminate art-house fans, Japan fetishists, and furries.",

It was Jason Bateman that really carried this film. He&apos;s a very under-rated actor. The film is about friend of the opposite sex, with one, the male of course, having more feelings than the other. When he finds out that she wants to have a baby and is looking for the perfect man for his sperm, he&apos;s hurt cause she didn&apos;t pick him. The film really explores parenthood in the modern age and also dynamics of friends, and even fatherhood. It&apos;s a comedy, but it has many dramatic and poignant elements to it. I&apos;d recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Muddy River is in many ways an excellent film. It has an earthy, empathetic, and unfiltered connection to the human struggles of post-war Japan. In an establishing scene, a child sings the type of obscene ditty that we know kids have always sung (here I&apos;ll call it &quot;Grandpa poo&quot;). Physical wounds are healed for some, psychological ones clearly remain. Later in the movie when a newspaper headline announces, &quot;The post-war period&quot; is over, the noodle shop proprietor&apos;s face reveals a deep reluctance to move on from this grief.\n\nThe overarching storyline of Muddy River concerns two families on either side of a muddy river on the outskirts of Osaka. A noodle shop owner, his wife and their child who all live on the premises, and a prostitute and her two children who arrive in a houseboat on the other side. The children from both sides hesitantly interact and share experiences, even though the boat mum appears to have gone through this dynamic before and is pessimistic about the possibility of sharing problems and mutual consoling due to her profession.\n\nThe film reaches moments of incredible poignancy as it broaches themes of illness and dying, but the sensitivity of these scenes, which rivals that of Ozu and more, is marred by creative missteps. Firstly thee crabs are dipped in paraffin and set alight, they cringe and writhe in agony as a result, and secondly the film has a sentimental attitude to war in Manchuria. This war was an aggressive, unprovoked and genocidal war, characterized by the almost obliteration of Oroqen and Hezhen ethnic groups, and by atrocities that are unfathomable in their cruelty, including human vivisection without pain relief and deliberately promoting epidemics. It is not enough to characterise this episode as one of nostalgic Japanese loss of comrades, as embodied by the singing of melancholic and misguided war songs, &quot;our friends lie buried under rocks in the fields. It was only yesterday...sad yesterday...that they charged bravely against the enemy and gave them their just deserts.&quot; No Japanese soldier handed out any just deserts in Manchuria, rather they imposed a cruel and insane reign of terror.\n\nMuddy River is a compassionate slice-of-life movie from post-war Osaka that suffers from blind spots. The film&apos;s attempts to illustrate Kiichi&apos;s developmental damage through animal suffering create a profound disconnect between empathy and ethical responsibility. The positive reception of the movie highlights the risks of engaging with arthouse material superficially. If a film fails to change the way we see the world or help us recognize moral wrongs, but instead invites passive indulgence in an aesthetic of empathy, it ultimately fails in its mission.",

      "reviewBody": "Zappa was great. An okay guitarist, but a genius composer/band leader. He was the Miles Davis of rock- finding the best young musicians and pushing them to the next level. That&apos;s what he did with Terry Bozzio, who (in my opinion) steals the show(DVD). Highlights are &apos;Pound for a Brown&apos; with Bozzio, Mars and O&apos;hearn getting real intense, the pre-&apos;Disco-boy&apos; drum solo, Bozzio&apos;s awesome performance on &apos;Punky&apos;s Whips,&apos; and of course the great abstract claymation. I&apos;d be happy if this video was all claymation and drum solos, but most of the rest of the movie is cool too. The dood with the blow-up doll and gas mask gets kinda annoying, but the DVD makes up for it by having Adrian Belew dance around in a dress. I&apos;d strongly recommend this to any drummer because there are some great close-ups on Bozzio as he hurts the feelings of other drummers by keeping perfect grooves and being funny at the same time. That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking&apos; about.",

      "reviewBody": "I first heard of this when TNT was showing it after the TV premiere of Rumble In The Bronx. I couldn&apos;t make it through the first 10 minutes because of the bad dubbing and the mixing around of scenes (The very first scene was Jackie and Yuen skateboarding in Spain, rather than them waking up and getting into their morning routine). A couple of months ago, I got the Hong Kong DVD and loved it. \n\nThe movie is about Thomas (Chan) and David (Biao), two Chinese guys who run a successful food truck business in Spain. They get caught up in wannabe detective Moby&apos;s (Hung) case to find a Spanish heiress, and the fun goes from there. The chemistry is great between the three brothers, and Lola Forner is a great distraction. The writing is funny, and Sammo&apos;s direction is right on target. The fight scenes are great. If you want to watch vintage Jackie, watch this film as he can move quick. The much talked about fight between Chan and Benny &quot;The Jet&quot; Urquidez does not disappoint. Want a lesson in how to do a fight scene? Watch these two guys go at it (They would have a rematch a few years later in Dragons Forever). \n\nFor all of you fans of JC credit outtakes, there is none (JC didn&apos;t start using them until Police Story). But in a funny, action packed movie like this, you won&apos;t care. It is one of The 3 Brothers best, and it will leave you wanting more.",

      "reviewBody": "Sci-fi is a specialty of Brad Armstrong for Wicked Pictures, and this way overrated &quot;Euphoria&quot; (title reflects so-called critics&apos; reactions) earned a decent budget and ultimately 9-day shooting schedule. But the result is far from the Adult Cinema milestone so many of Brad&apos;s features get tagged with.\n\nIts main drawback is common to many sci-fi movies, which have yet to fully realize the potential of sci-fi literature, &quot;Dune&quot; the most obvious example. I once interviewed, over 30 years ago, a producer who was prepping to shoot a 3-feature, back-to-back adaptation of Asimov&apos;s classic The Foundation trilogy -the material George Lucas was unable to option when he shot &quot;Star Wars&quot; instead back in 1976, and this is a project on a similar scale.\n\nIt emerges as a typical post-Apocalyptic tale, replete with costuming left over from that famous Kevin Coaster disaster &quot;Waterworld&quot;, and obvious influences from a host of both Hollywood, &quot;Mad Max&quot; and Italian B-movies. Holding it all together are two eminently talented actresses, not just sex workers out of Chatsworth but bona fide actresses: Sydnee Steele as the heroine and a striking (in black wig) Ava Vincent as villainess.\n\nMike Horner is entertainingly hammy as the mad doctor of the piece, using Steele as his guinea pig as he experiments with an experimental drug U-4, to create a state in the taker of euphoria, not just sex (which is the main point of this XXX film) but a raising of consciousness. There&apos;s plenty of sex on screen with a well-chosen cast, so what&apos;s to complain about.\n\nSimply put, the script by the late David Aaron Clark, as embellished by Brad, is filled with turgid, incomprehensible expository dialog, which even Horner has trouble spitting out without stumbling. Since the viewer, including sci-fi buffs like myself, has zero interest in listening to this mumbo-jumbo Brad should have jettisoned most if not all of it. Or taken the expedient route Ken Russell did for his only big-budget movie &quot;Altered States&quot; when he conflicted with screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky: Ken had his cast including William Hurt and Blair Brown recite the dialog at breakneck speed as if they had time-traveled back into a vintage Howard Hawks movie like &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;.\n\nAs it stands, the endless dialog overemphasizes the pretentiousness of the project, making it almost as silly as Brad&apos;s similar but awful &quot;Underworld&quot;. An overblown orgy scene in which basically several individual sex scenes are merged in 3-ring circus fashion in a futuristic night club is typical of the bloating that has made Brad the George Stevens of porn (the great director whose earlier crisp movies later gave way to elephatine proeductions like &quot;Giant&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. I enjoyed seeing the &quot;girls only&quot; stunning big- breaster Tanya Danielle opposite April in the orgy footage, but she gets lost in the shuffle while Brad insists on throwing in some trendy Fetish content involving speculum and other medical equipment kink.\n\nSo Ava Vincent&apos;s fine performance is wasted, and perhaps only Steele emerges unscathed, as she&apos;s the most reliable performer in Brad&apos;s (as well as working for Michael Raven elsewhere) troupe. Most recently Brad in his longterm (20 years-plus) contract with Wicked has been reduced by changing audience tastes and dwindling budgets to sci-fi on a shoestring, as evidenced by his recent all-sex, lousy release &quot;Sexbots&quot;. It&apos;s poetic justice after the waste of so-called &quot;blockbusters&quot; like &quot;Euphoria&quot; -replete with its self-congratulatory Bonus Disk."

They still never met with the ghosts that they looking for, until they went to a remote village to unlock the dark secret of that village, with playing Jelangkung, a traditional ghost calling game with a medium.  They think they not succeed to raised the dead, so they decided to went back home. They should do the &quot;think again&quot;! The evil manage to catch them up, and the terror begins!\n\nIf Japan has `Ringu&apos; and Hong Kong has `The Eye&apos;, Indonesia has `Jelangkung&apos;. Jelangkung is the most successful horror movies ever made in Indonesia and haunting the theaters for months.\n\nIn my point of view, `Jelangkung&apos; is a so-so horror film. Even it manage to scare the peoples who&apos;s watched it, but technically  I think the directors (Rizal Mantovani &amp; Jose Purnomo) should need to return the movie to editing room once again. They often trapped in unneeded situations and boring conversation (that looks hard to looks scientific!). The movie even can be shorter! The audio department needs to re-record. But I must raise my hat for the cinematography by Jose Purnomo, because it looks so slick and hip and spoiling our eyes.  The acting is not award worthy, but considering this is their pictorial debut, they do well to integral their self with the movie&apos;s construction.\n\n Considering the tight budget that it had, &quot;Jelangkung&quot; is really a well-done film feature. Now we gain other talented directors to make the Indonesian movies more colorful.   The sequel (`Tusuk Jelangkung&apos;) is going to out this year. I hope the new director (Dimas Djayadiningrat) could make it even better than this one. \n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;ve probably heard of Koko over the years. Maybe you&apos;re seen a PBS special on the internationally famous gorilla or read an article about her. Once considered a controversial experiment in primate communication, Koko now seems practically human when compared to other gorillas in the wild and that is one of the wry points raised in this candid documentary by Barbet Schroeder, a gifted filmmaker.\n\nThe day to day instruction and training you see Koko receiving from Dr. Francis &quot;Penny&quot; Patterson in this intimate portrait is not the kid-friendly portrait you&apos;d expect. You get to see Koko on off days when she doesn&apos;t want to sign with Penny, when she seems bored and restless with her daily routine, or when she rebels against Penny&apos;s authority by engaging in minor destructive acts within her living area. Her home, basically a bland, institutional space with hardly any natural light, is depressing and there are few scenes with Koko enjoying the outdoors freely. Despite Dr. Patterson&apos;s assurances that she is making incredible breakthroughs in communication between humans and apes, viewers may get the feeling that Koko is being brainwashed through repetitious instruction. Her only other exposure to gorillas is Michael, a young ape who is also being trained to communicate using American sign language. Is Dr. Patterson raising a new breed of gorillas who will only be able to sign with each other and research scientists in a private facility of Stanford University? Can Koko, who was once housed in the San Francisco Zoo, communicate with apes in the wild or even zoo apes? The real problem is that Koko may not even think of herself as a gorilla anymore. You have to wonder if she might not have been better off at the San Francisco Zoo where she at least would have enjoyed more outside activity, was able to relate to other gorillas, and was free of scientific experimentation.\n\nThe most sobering thought you are left with is the current state of gorillas in the wild. Are they better off in zoos or research facilities instead of running free in the wilds where they are fair game for poachers, hunters, and the increasing crush of human progress?"

She lives on junk food and meat. He is a vegetarian. He is highly idealistic. She is totally self centred. He easy going and rational. She is erratic and touchy. There is no attraction besides sex. Usually such differences just create fodder for humour, but in this movie, it turns into a mild horror.\n\nThe movie is mostly them sniping at each other. There are two other notable scenes.\n\nIn one they go to meet the boy&apos;s father, who seems to think he is Rush Limbaugh, or at least a worshipper. It is quite over the top, packing in every Republican stereotype into a few minutes. It is hilarious, horrifying and depressing.\n\nIn another scene, he almost marries a gigantic older woman besotted with him that he just met to help him toward Canadian citizenship. It is just creepy.\n\nOther than those two scenes, not much happens. It is like travels of a handsome young man with his cranky cat companion. She is not intelligent enough to say anything interesting, and not stupid enough to be amusing.\n\nThis is a strongly anti-Bush film. It was made by Canadians. It has fun with the stereotypes Americans and Canadians have about each other.",

      "reviewBody": "This film didn&apos;t really work for me. After reading the, mostly, wonderful accolades above I was expecting better things from this movie but finished up being disappointed. It wasn&apos;t the inactivity either. I like Bella Tarr films so I am used to long takes with not very much happening. Another reviewer of a Tarr film recently noted that you could write a masters thesis on what is not going on, in between the bits of dialog. Okay, this is kind of cutesy but I know what he meant. There is a tension or at least a relationship between the characters and sometimes a &quot;drama of the moment&quot; in the &quot;what will happen next&quot;, sense. With the Spyros character there was the feeling that during his moments of stoic inactivity (of which there was a lot), there was nothing going on inside. It was just a complete blank-out, no drama; no tension from silent inner feelings directed towards another, just nothing. The same scene could have been shot to equal effect without him being there. I was waiting for someone to come up to him and shout &quot;Hello in there&quot;, in Greek of course or to give him a much needed kick in the seat of his pants. Whilst I am on the subject of pants, I would have reckoned that someone with a grown up son and two grown up daughters would have at least known that you have to open them in order to have sex. Any spotty teenager on his maiden voyage would not have acted in such an inept way. All the incidents except one in this film happened to Spyro not because of him. That one was when he drove his wagon through the front of a restaurant in order to get the girl and that came over as more of a student prank than an act of desperation.\n\nBut, hey, I hear you say, this is a film that deals with the problems of loneliness and isolation and I should be more sympathetic to his situation. I understand this point of view however it is difficult to empathize with someone who has turned his back on a wife that obviously still had feelings for him; a family he could draw round him but who are now indifferent to him and friends throughout the country who he leaves at the first opportunity. Even the girl, who was selfish, never really did anything bad towards him. Spyro had no warmth within him and never did anything to gain respect. In the end even his beloved bees turned against him.\n\nIn my opinion the high ranking Artificial Eye distributor has scored an own goal with this one but the enthusiasm of others will probably vindicate them.",

      "reviewBody": "Hema Malini was a good actress but as a director, she failed to give hit films. This film was also supposed to be Shah Rukh Khan&apos;s debut but thankfully, Deewana came and gave him his first hit. Otherwise, this movie would be his debut and yes, this movie was a box office disaster.\n\nThe movie is about a young girl you is brought up in a brothel, she makes a living as a cabaret dancer in some other guy&apos;s club. She is not a happy person as she knows her mom is alive but can&apos;t find her, with the help of a friend(played by SRK) she goes on a search. However, the search gets complicated as many people are not as they seem to be and too many characters create a confusion. Will the girl find her dear mother? Will she be able to bring a permanent smile on her face? Watch the movie to find out.\n\nThe movie is all about a search to find the girl&apos;s mother and the search goes well but there are too many subplots which drags the film. The attention a viewer has on the main plot is not long lasting as the subplots tend to bore the viewer. The film is lengthy and editing is not well conducted as the film has many rough patches. To make matters worse, there are quite a lot of arguments and problems between characters and the overacting in these scenes tend to irritate. Music is the saving grace thanks to a couple of good tunes but none of them are up to the mark, none of them became hits.\n\nDirection by Hema Malini is poor, she fails for the most part. She handles a few scenes well and the comic scenes are good for its time although clichéd in parts. Her direction falls flat when the emotional and serious parts of the movie occur, it looks unintentionally funny in some scenes. The end is also not justified and the subplots don&apos;t connect with the main plot which means all these subplots move parallel as a result, there is no flow in the storyline of the film.\n\nPerformances are anything great either, SRK is functional but this is one of his earlier films and he wasn&apos;t much of a good actor. He did much better in Raju Ban Gaya Gentlemen and Baazigar after which he actually started to rock as an actor. The heroine has a meatier role than SRK and she does a decent job, the rest overact horribly. Even veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty does a bland job, this is one of his weak films.\n\nOn the whole, Di Aashna Hai is a poor film, it fails for the most part though a few scenes are worth watching. However, the movie in general is a wasted product. Die hard SRK fans might like it but this is definitely not one of SRK&apos;s good films.",

Although there&apos;s a lot of action, it&apos;s forgettable or it just doesn&apos;t captivate us, and never really lives up to what could been. It falls below the ranks of being a memorable if kind of dry actioner, which wastes a great cast, including a smaller part by an Aussie actor who does the voice over for the very same VHS company who brought out this forgettable film, whose cover poster of our hunky actor lead, is no less than engaging. And of course, you&apos;re not expecting a feat of acting chops. Again, more brawn than brain. This is a film that just seems to run a limited course, and falls short many times. Even in it&apos;s exciting and promising start (perpetual lasting explosions have never been more beautiful) it gives in too easy, where promising suspense is killed. The film keeps running short on things, unhelped by bad editing, if working on a short budget. Out hunky Lewis, code name Jaguar, who&apos;s betrayed at the start, is enlisted to take down an international drug dealer. The great Christopher Lee is one of the few highlights of the film, and Cappucine, plays a great vilanness, but bottom line, this is just a forgettable film. Even with Jaguar claiming arse kicking revenge, we&apos;re hardly moved or riveted. Jaguar, certainly a force to be reckoned, won&apos;t live on in the mind of moviegoers, just less demanding ones, in a slightly bland type action film, that certainly won&apos;t leave an imprint on us audience.",

It&apos;s a comedy with a deep meaning that has me feeling delighted and content every time I watch it. And I confess I cry near the end every time . It&apos;s not the &quot;ha ha&quot; type of comedy really. It&apos;s just a light hearted movie with a few jokes here and there and a good emotional message to pass to the viewers. One of my favorites . The only reason I&apos;m writing this review now so many years later is that I saw the 6.4 rating and I could not believe it . How is that even possible? Maybe from 1s from people expecting to see something else entirely ? What can I say besides how much I still appreciate this movie..",

If they decide to make Eldest (The sequel to Eragon) it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters (the ones they actually decided to add) share no similarities to the book&apos;s idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn&apos;t had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom, Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie, Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three (and Nasuada doesn&apos;t say who she is) and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book, you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn&apos;t supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira&apos;s wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing. Bottom Line: Could have been a great and timeless movie. Not Lord of the Rings worthy.",

      "reviewBody": "Cover Girl&apos;s importance lies not in its originality as a book (it&apos;s a standard backstage Cinderella story), as much as it does in what happened to each of its stars. Gene Kelly was &quot;loaned out&quot; to do it when MGM boss L.B. Mayer didn&apos;t have much use for him at his own studio. His performance in this film, coupled with the ground-breaking &apos;Alter Ego&apos; dance solo (duo?) was so successful that it made MGM take him seriously at last (he was never loaned out again) and allowed him to flourish with the soon-to-come hits of &quot;Anchors Aweigh,&quot; &quot;On The Town,&quot; and &quot;An American In Paris.&quot; Likewise for Rita Hayworth; Columbia had been grooming her for years, but she had done mostly B-level films. CG showed her off as a lead in glorious Technicolor, and paved the way for GILDA, her signature (and much more adult) role. Here she and Kelly make a sweet couple, and dance well in &quot;Put Me To The Test&quot; and the fresh, energetic &quot;Make Way For Tomorrow.&quot; They are at their most poignant in &quot;Long Ago And Far Away,&quot; but the number (played on piano by Phil Silvers and sung as they both stack up nightclub chairs) seems to beg for a dance number, then doesn&apos;t have one. Another good number is the title tune, which pays tribute to the famous American magazines/cover girl models of the day. Hayworth appears as the last model, running down a curved runway in a gold dress with her flaming mane flying behind her. A dream in Technicolor!!"

Here are adorable pig is seen with some new colourful friends, lots of them, in a new adventure. Just like the first one, this one too is sheer delight, albeit a little more serious. I don&apos;t understand why people are complaining that this isn&apos;t a movie for kids. Why not? I think it&apos;s an excellent family film. There is no death or blood. It portrays a part of reality (e.g. that accidents happen, that there are others who are less fortunate than us etc) without getting to graphic and that&apos;s why it&apos;s great for kids too. It&apos;s a lot of fun and even suspenseful. I was in my teens when I first saw this film. There&apos;s one scene where Flealick follows the van but one he loses hold, he slides onto one side of the street and lies there motionless while the wheels on his &apos;scooter&apos; rotate. For a moment my heart had stopped beating (as I thought he was dead) and I was so hoping that he hadn&apos;t passed away. The sequence that followed brought me back to laughing mode. Magda Szubanski has more to do here and she displays her comic abilities brilliantly. A strange thing I noticed was she had an American accent in the first film but here it&apos;s Australian and British. The rest of the voice-acting is done very well and in sync. The fictitious city (it may be Sidney as the famous opera-house was visible in one scene) is suitably dark and mysterious. I found &apos;Babe: Pig In The City&apos; more uplifting than the first movie. I wish there was a third movie that would have made it a complete trilogy."

      "name": "Really Exciting Serial! Same &apos;Ol Tropes, Maybe, But Karloff&apos;s a Genuine Winner",
      "reviewBody": "Over the last several nights have watched &quot;The Hope Diamond Mystery&quot; (1921), a captivating 15 chapter serial which runs a total of five hours. Starring Grace Darmond, Harry Carter, George Chesebro, Boris Karloff (in his first major starring rôle), Carmen Phillips, William Marion, and others, this one really kept me honestly interested the entire length and made me wish to come back night after night! As with all serials, there are a couple of continuity problems, and this one has been lovingly restored (by Eric Stedman of Serial Squadron), but there are still one or two small instances where some frames have been transposed and not put back exactly correctly; yet, these are trifles. The finished product of restoration has some wonderfully tinted and toned scenes, and overall, everything was rather sharp compared to many I&apos;ve watched. I originally bought this to watch Boris Karloff. He plays two rôles, a Hindu servant to the current owner of the Hope diamond and also a servant of Sita in India in an earlier century in a flashback story where he keeps watch over one of the temples to Sita. Grace Darmond is the star, and she plays the secretary of William Marion, current owner of the diamond, and she also plays a hapless girl in India who becomes involved with the diamond in an earlier century. The baddies - oh, and they&apos;re ba-a-d! - are Harry Carter and his wife, Carmen Phillips. Carter plays Sidney Atherton, a man who constantly disguises himself as Nang Fu (obviously here an evil Chinaman, playing up the &quot;yellow scare&quot;), and Atherton also plays Ghung, a nasty sort from India in those scenes of an earlier century. All the way through Atherton is after the diamond. Any way he can get it. Any way. Through thick and thin. Chesebro plays many parts, too. He&apos;s the love interest throughout of Darmond, and though he&apos;s supposed to be the heroic savior of his lady at all times, the part is not quite written that way. It is fate - led on by the diamond, of course - that is the anti-hero/hero/mysterious fate-causer/evil. Sort of leading us through all this is May Yohe, formerly Lady Francis Hope in real life, a former owner of the Hope diamond when she was married to Francis Hope. She may actually have once owned the diamond, but this is all supposedly based on events told in a memoir she wrote. Yeah, uh-huh. The whole thing is hooey - but it&apos;s so much fun. I really enjoyed this a lot. Available on DVD from the Serial Squadron. Let me add that the accompaniments music-wise were also excellent and apt throughout.",

So, this is Europe? OK, the quality of 25 short features gathered by political means may necessarily be uneven.

Die Hard was about a really cool guy in a really bad situation, and the result was probably the greatest action movie ever made.  Die Hard 2 achieves status on its own just by being about the same thing. When so many movies want to be Die Hard but fail, why not just make another Die Hard? Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger)realized that because it&apos;s a sequel, there had to be more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2 (appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of the genre."

As it unfolds it splits into two separate narratives involving Nielsen on one hand and Dillman on the other.\n\nBut the mood darkens considerably (and the plot turns far more ghoulish) as the political implications of creating longevity for a select and amoral few (here decided by a cabal called the Committee of Nine) are explored. And when the two strands finally come together there&apos;s a zinger of a punchline.\n\nAngie Dickinson (now ninety) also has a raunchy scene shaving Dillman.",

We also leave commitments, partners, children, our post, the apartment. And if we get really able to reach the state of completely breaking off all outer belongings without touching our inner states, we are still far away from being free: We are neither free to do something, because in well-organized societies, my freedom-to stops exactly there where the freedom-to of my neighbor starts, and since we are crowded on this planet, there is not much to accomplish. And neither is our freedom-from so easily to achieve, because we live in a global society where only the suicide is for free.\n\nIn Tanners&apos;s &quot;Messidor&quot; we have Marie and Jeanne, whose freedom-to ends quickly, namely in the moment where there are out of money. In &quot;Charles vif ou mort&quot;, Charles&apos; freedom-from ends there, where he sees that it is not to accomplish without destroying the whole society, which is rather impossible. And in the never-land between freedom-to and freedom-from, there is Paul in &quot;Dans la Ville Blanche&quot;, the Swiss sailor, who decides one day not go back to his ship but to stay in Lisbon until his money is gone. In a letter to his partner in Zurich, he writes: &quot;I am not in vacation, since a vacation must be planned, and planning is work. I am doing NOTHING&quot;. All central characters of Tanner&apos;s movie want the same: to experiment how it is possible to experience the ABSENCE of something: the empty space as absence from the crowd, the empty time as the absence of obligations in society. And all of them fail sooner or later: either they cannot go on anymore, because the emptiness has turned into nonsense, or people do not let them go, because they want them put behind bars - of prisons or clinics.",

It is much helped by veteran actors Robert Preston and Dan O&apos;Herlihy. Lance Guest does a great turn as Alex as well.\n\nThe effects were not appreciated at the time, I think, but hold up fairly well. They were drawn on that Holy Grail of computers to us children of the 80&apos;s; a Kray Supercomputer.\n\nThe score is well done, the humor timed well and the overall good feeling I get from watching it never fades.

      "reviewBody": "While quite original in it&apos;s concept of studying people who kill themselves in incredibly stupid ways, the delivery is jumbled and not as entertaining as it might have been. If you were to lose the totally unnecessary documentary film maker and the ridiculous, cartoon-like serial killer, the movie would have benefited. When it is describing one of the outrageous idiots and their stunts, the film is in high gear. Unfortunately it repeatedly bogs down and this starting and stopping ruins the whole tone of &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot;. I recommend simply checking out the idiotic segments and skipping the rest. This would have made a superior short, but as a feature it fails, because there is too much going on at once. Less would have been best. - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "I do not review as often as I should, but sometimes I feel like not doing so would mean a sleepless night. This is one of those nights.\n\nThe Last Seven is arguably the most poorly constructed, ill-fated, and hopeless attempt at making a movie I have ever seen outside those who recognize the feebleness of their movie and attempt to at least derive some kind of humor out of the film. It is so difficult for me to decide where to begin, because everything is wrong.\n\nIf that does not satisfy your curiosity, then let me hit the big three as I see them.\n\nNumber 1: Character development. Throughout the entire film, I was never given any reason to care about any of the characters outside of a boo-hoo flashback for someones missed birthday. I didn&apos;t care if they lived, if they died, or if they were forced to sit through their own horrible acting. I just didn&apos;t care about anything that was happening to them in the slightest, and it destroyed what little bit of plot development there was. And when I say little, I mean LITTLE.\n\nNumber 2: Wannabe artistic filming and editing. Out of place flashbacks, requiem-for-a-dream shortcut film sequences, long, drawn out scenes flip-flopping with super short, shaky camera snapshot progressions, third grade special effects, the &quot;hitchcock&quot; scare (attempt) and the list goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on. And. On.\n\nNumber 3: Worse than a M. Night Shyamalan twist ending. Nuff said.\n\nThe only thing decent about this movie was the scenery, abandoned cities always look awesome.\n\nDon&apos;t waste your time, and don&apos;t make me tell you I told you so.",

One thing I should note, though, is that he got very scared at the end when the social worker turned into an alien and started attacking people, so even though it&apos;s a kid&apos;s film, I&apos;d advise you don&apos;t take very young children as they may get scared.",

      "reviewBody": "Phil Hartman and Sinbad star in Houseguest a 1995 comedy about what happens when one stranger pretends another person&apos;s best friend and the close relationship these two form even after the truth is revealed.\n\nPhil Hartman has starred in great movies like &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;The Coneheads&quot; , and &quot;Jingle All The Way&quot;, but this is probably his least seen movie although it&apos;s a funny one.\n\nPhil Hartman plays Gary Young, a young executive who has problems with his wife and young kids . Hartman dislikes his boss but doesn&apos;t have the guts to stand up to him.\n\nSinbad plays Kevin Franklin, a guy who has yet to pay a debt to the mob for $50,000, Instead of paying the debt, Franklin goes on the run and proceeds to impersonates one of Young&apos;s best friend, a dentist named Derek Bond. Young hasn&apos;t seen Bond in a long time, so he has no clue what Bond looks like. Franklin does a good a hilarious job of fooling Young that he is Derek Bond. In one instance, Young invites Franklin to a party and asks him to look at the teeth at one of his guests, a beautiful young woman. When this beautiful woman starts to smile, Franklin sees she has lost a couple of teeth, and responds &quot;Oh!!! Geez&quot;, it&apos;s a funny scene that had me laughing. Pretty soon Franklin starts showing Gary Young&apos;s guest how to boogie and dance, using the black soul in him. I enjoyed this moment, because although the movie doesn&apos;t state it, part of it&apos;s enjoyment is the togetherness of the black culture of Franklin with the white culture of Young. When both guys starts partying together, we see both white and black people can exist together in peace. Anyhow, more fun ensues as Franklin is asked to perform an important dental procedure to an old friend of Young, and proceeds to do utterly stupid stunts with great results. Franklin then bonds with all the kids of Mr. Young including Jason, Joey, Sarah Young. In one scene, he takes the kids to play basketball against a couple of young bullies and he and the kids proceeds to beat up these kids playing tough basketball. The kids love Franklin with all his warmth and humor, than even at the end when they find out his real name it doesn&apos;t matter, because they know he is a good guy.\n\nWe get more laughter close to the end, as the Young family helps Franklin get rid of the mob idiots that are following him. By the end of the movie Young, is a totally different, he is more secure and confident, thanks to his best friend, that he stands up his boss and becomes closer to his family. Only 2 people reviewed this movie, so that tells me, that alot of people still haven&apos;t seen it. I recommended this great movie to everyone"

      "reviewBody": "West of Memphis (2012) \n\n**** (out of 4)\n\nThis here is basically the fourth documentary to take a look at the West Memphis Three case, which gained worldwide attention after the PARADISE LOST trilogy. Countless celebrities including Johnny Depp, Eddie Vedder, Henry Rollins and Peter Jackson came to the three men&apos;s cause and they are also featured here.\n\nSo what this fourth film basically does is give you an overview of the case as well as new bits of information regarding who the killer might be. Let me start off by saying that this is a wonderfully entertaining film even though it is hard to watch at times since crime photos are shown in great detail. In fact, I will say that all four films on the subject were wonderful and certainly highly entertaining.\n\nWith that said, as they bring up in this movie, the case will always be controversial with some believing the three men are guilty and others believing that they were set up by some crooked cops. Some believe that the media attention got three killers off with murder while others believe that the media forced the state of Arkansas to set the guys free. Even at the end, the controversy continues as the three men admit to be guilty but take a loophole law to say they&apos;re also innocent.\n\nI must admit that the PARADISE LOST series tried to place blame on one of the stepfather&apos;s but that person is shown as a great guy here. A new suspect is brought into play with evidence linking him to the crime but due to this loophole he will never be brought to trial. All four movies have demanded that the three men be released from prison and they have been. My question is now: what about the person who committed the crimes? What about the parents to the three murdered children? Is anything being done for them?"

I honestly enjoyed it rather more than the film before with the shrieking sky chickens and the China-inspired mountain locale here is rather nice.

      "reviewBody": "Any movie fan remembers the iconic line from &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;: &quot;what we&apos;ve got here is failure to communicate&quot;. I believe a similar diagnosis can be made about the two lead characters of &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) because he&apos;s autistic, and his brother Charlie, 25 years younger, because he&apos;s a young yuppie blinded by his own ego. Both live in their world, both are their own referential; naturally, they&apos;re put in a situation where they have to interact. &quot;Rain Man&quot; features one of the most intriguing premises of the 80&apos;s, and although the film never strikes as a &apos;masterpiece&apos;, not even in style, it does deliver the emotional pay-off we all expect without recycling old archetypes or falling into sentimental trap.\n\nShould I describe Raymond Babbit&apos;s condition? Those who know already have in mind his mimics, head-banging, &apos;uh-oh&apos;, his addictions to such TV programs as &quot;Judge Wapner&quot; and &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot; and his perfect recitation of Abbots and Costello&apos;s &apos;Who&apos;s on first&apos; routine when he&apos;s uncomfortable. And to those who haven&apos;t, it&apos;s enough saying that Dustin Hoffman surpasses himself, if it ever was possible after performances of the caliber of &quot;Tootsie&quot; or &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. He&apos;s unbelievably convincing, capable to transcend the limits of acting. To win an Oscar for a rather one-note character is an exploit even more impressive because Hoffman manages to pull some human complexity in Raymond, making him absolutely endearing and adorable yet frustrating and scary. Raymond is a character we want to love without turning it into pity.\n\nOn the other hand, his brother Charlie is the total counterpart, young, handsome, he&apos;s a self-made man who exploited a passion for cars to sell imported vehicles. Even his girlfriend, played by the beautiful Valeria Golino is Italian, like a foreign beautiful possession, a trophy that elevates him above the others. Charlie Babbit is a character who flirts with the archetype of the young and arrogant go-getter, a role tailor-made for an actor like Tom Cruise, especially in the 80&apos;s. The talent of Cruise consists on making his character unlovable enough to laugh at his misfortunes with Raymond, but human enough to feel sad for him when he learns about his father&apos;s death, and much more, when he learns that he didn&apos;t get one cent from him, while he was full of debts. Charlie is a character we want to hate but end up giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnd Charlie is so blinded by his financial problems that he&apos;s incapable to care for Raymond and take his medical condition into consideration; all he sees in him is the guy who inherited three millions from his father. At this point, I suspect the screenwriter immediately thought &apos;hey, in fact, Raymond is medically autistic, while Charlie is symbolically autistic; let&apos;s see if the viewers will figure that&apos;. I don&apos;t think it takes a degree in psychoanalysis to jump to that conclusion. Anyone would see the kidnapping of Raymond coming. Naturally, the girlfriend leave them to let the adventure begin between the two brothers and both would learn how to communicate  not. This is where the odd-couple/road movie formula stops. The strength of &quot;Rain Man&quot; is to never make Raymond change, no miracle cure, no sudden change of behavior, if there is one who&apos;s up to change, it&apos;s Charlie. And he must change, otherwise, the whole premise of the film is pointless.\n\nThe quality of Barry Levinson&apos;s film is to make a predictable turn of events work remaining believable, it also grabs our interest without an abundance of spectacular scenes, or overused emotion. It&apos;s always interesting to see a character with leadership quality, handsome and somewhat charismatic, pushed to follow an autistic man and having to deal with out-of-control situations. Charlie wants to take Raymond in L.A, but they can&apos;t because Raymond is afraid of planes, and when Raymond starts screaming in panic, Charlie understands that the road trip will follow Raymond&apos;s parameters of life. In a way, Raymond Babbit is a leading role because he leads the story. And by following Raymond, Charlie will get to know more about his brother&apos;s sensitivity and become more empathic, a word he knew nothing about. The narrative progresses and provides the film&apos;s greatest twist, when Charlie realizes he can use Raymond&apos;s savant skills.\n\nTill now, the film is mostly remembered for the &apos;Las Vegas&apos; sequence and the iconic moment when the two brothers stand on a descending escalator wearing the same suit, and the last step between Charlie and Raymond&apos;s reconciliation, a clever partnership for a rewarding pay-off. It&apos;s obvious that Charlie was mostly motivated by greed, but it&apos;s impossible not to see genuine attachment growing between Cruise and Hoffman. Both had failure to communicate their feelings, but it&apos;s by inviting his brother to communicate his inner thoughts, his fears and desires that Charlie learned the process of listening, of using another referential than his, of being capable of giving and understanding. The film follows the traditional coming-of-realization structure, and on that level, Tom Cruise never makes his changing obvious and spectacular. Indeed, both actors are so good, almost equally, because it was to Cruise to portray anger and frustration without making it forced or over the top.\n\nWithout Hoffman and Cruise, I can&apos;t imagine the film having the same impact. Yes, the screenplay is well-written, and Hans Zimmer&apos;s score has a haunting effect, but it&apos;s definitely an actors&apos; film. It ended up winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1988, which is quite surprising considering how simple and non-Best Picture material it feels, but it did created a genuine interest for autistic condition, and featured many memorable scenes, and I guess sometimes, that&apos;s enough to touch the hearts.",

      "reviewBody": "I happened to catch this movie during a free-preview weekend on Starz. I had never heard of it, so I did not know what to expect. For the whole duration of the movie, about 90 min., I was at the edge of my seat. The plot takes several unexpected turns and is packed with continuous action, while the characters are very believable. O.k., fine, it does not deal with deep moral issues, if you want a movie that will make you want to go out and change the world this is not it. But if you want an entertaining movie that will give you a big dose of adrenaline, will have you raise yourself from your seat, I strongly recommend it. By the way, I am not a big fun of horror teenage movies like Scream, I just don&apos;t find them believable, and find the characters shallow. The best part about this movie is that you actually feel sympathy for the victims, the plot is probable, and the action scenes do not require that the actors possess superhuman strength. At the end of the movie the only thing I could think of was &quot;holy cow&quot;, a response I usually associate with a great roller coaster ride.",

I wonder if they had badges that said &quot;Radar Agent&quot;?\n\n&quot;Our beams have all the roads covered&quot; the head agent says, so we are reassured that radar can solve any crime. Everybody knows that radar beams aimed at all the streets catches criminals, right? So, ordinary crimes that would have been solved by regular means are solved by radar machines instead, presumably at a great waste of taxpayer dollars. And a black Chevrolet runs around town with a silly metal dome bolted to its roof. \n\nThe director of this movie really did a lousy job, and the acting is poor except for Tom Neal who is convincing as a bad guy. Buxom Adele Jergens has the role of a blonde gang moll, but I still haven&apos;t figured out why her character is in the script at all. John Howard, as Radar Agent Travis, has exactly the same expression on his face throughout the whole film. I guess he thought &quot;why bother&quot; to smile, frown or emote at all. Absolutely nobody involved seems to care that they are in this film, but all they are asked to do is just read their lines and get in and out of cars. \n\nIf you are a fan of any of the actors involved, or even a fan of Lippert Pictures (which made some far better movies than this), you should just skip &quot;Radar Secret Service&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of the violent Spaghetti Westerns I was pretty disappointed in this wanna be! The movie handles the story of &quot;El Macho&quot;, a violent gambler who earns his money in 2-day poker games. One day a local sheriff finds out he&apos;s the spitting image of the &quot;Buzzard&quot;. The perfect opportunity for the arm of the law to replace the &quot;Buzzard&quot; who was recently killed in a gunfight. This way they have the perfect occasion as solution to infiltrate the gang of The Duke. One detail though, the Buzzard wasn&apos;t the smartest nor the toughest gang member. He was more like the low life of the bunch everyone picked on. This information didn&apos;t suit &quot;El Macho&quot; at all, as a brutal gambler he couldn&apos;t take someone picking on him in any way!\n\nThe story itself sounds appealing, though the director hits the ball completely in the wrong direction. Instead of delivering a strong original story he serves us a boring and uninteresting plot in a mixture of a totally off beat soundtrack, bad acting and slow motion scenes which will bug the hell out of you while watching this film. \n\nThe look of the movie itself is dull and dark, the director must have shot his movie on sun-less days. One of the main characteristics of a Western flick, deserts filled with sweaty cowboys thru a burning sun? Well don&apos;t search for it in this picture, you wont find any sweat on their faces or a sunny desert scenes! The scenery in the back drop is mind-numbing and for sure something we&apos;ve already seen 1000 times before.\n\nThe promised violence, which brands most of these typical westerns, is also not to be found. The gun battles are short and you will loose most of the action thru the smoke. I know in that time, firing a gun was accompanied by some smoke of the black powder that ignited though I guess the FX-crew overdid it a little too much! \n\nI guess I hit the ball completely like it should be hit by stating we have a disappointing western flick, which deserves a full 1 out of 10.\n\nDario/",

Jean Simmons and Charles Laughton have the most interesting roles and play them brilliantly, particularly Laughton who is once again portraying Henry VIII, the shrewd monarch who disposed of the women in his life by putting them to the block.\n\nThe screenplay is gracefully written and although it is leisurely paced, it never lets up interest in examining the relationships between Elizabeth I (young Bess) and others at court. Historical purists will object to whatever liberties the novel took to tell this story of court intrigue, but they will be impressed by the attention paid to historical detail and the meticulous settings and costumes. The score by Miklos Rozsa is not obtrusive and yet it underlines the deep emotions portrayed by Simmons, Granger and Laughton. Deborah Kerr has a rather colorless and almost minor role as Catherine Parr and is unable to do much with it although she and Simmons photograph beautifully in color.\n\nEasy on the eyes and a very entertaining saga of a bloody chapter in England&apos;s history."

      "reviewBody": "What I found special about the &quot;Im Juli&quot; is that, although the story feels like a fantasy, the characters are very warm and real. All those meetings and coincidences looked a little unbelievable first time, but now I think everything makes sense if we see the story as an allegorymeaningful but at the same time light and funny.\n\nThe playfulness of the script might perhaps make some miss the message of the movie, but the message actually is there and is a strong one. As I see it, &quot;Im Juli&quot; is a story about hope and about finding life and happiness. Searching for the one meant for you in furthest places to realise that what you&apos;ve been searching for was right next to you all along.\n\nI liked the idea of the first part of the movie being a flashback until we get back to the sun eclipse we had seen at the beginning. After the sun comes out again it looks like dark gets out of Daniel&apos;s mind and the sun shows him the right way this time: that Juli was the one he had been searching all along. The whole journey changes Daniel incredibly much as with her sun amulet, Juli learns him to do the same as her: trust faith and go on searching for happiness. The ending was really perfect: all the 4 characters&apos; roads coming together and Daniel finally seeing the ultimate proof that he had found what he was looking for.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about the movie is that although the message is a serious one, the story is so light and everything goes on really fast and surprising. The whole journey through so many different countries and passing beside so many different people and cultures was really interesting and refreshing, as were all the characters in the movie. All the actors, playing the Turkish guy, Luna or the officer at the Romanian border, looked they were really enjoying their roles and brought most of the movie&apos;s humour: great, subtle and nothing Hollywood like.\n\nAll in all, I thought it was a really enjoyable movie, so different from the usual productions we get from Hollywood. Really a movie you shouldn&apos;t miss!",

Chuck gives us a little on screen action with a very simple love making scene. It was short and sweet which is much more than we need form Chuck in this department.\n\nNow that&apos;s get to the action we came to see. Chuck puts his karate skills to good use, and makes it all look good on camera with his quick kicks as he&apos;s chopping up the bad guys. The fights scenes are short, impressive and satisfying. Plus he does his signature jump kick into the front glass window of a moving car move he&apos;s done a few times on Walker Texas Ranger.\n\nIt&apos;s a good Chuck Norris movie to watch, but not his best.",

      "reviewBody": "The third of Barry Levinson&apos;s Baltimore trilogy (following Diner&apos; and Tin Men&apos;) is a gentle and low key yet hugely impressive film that is a worthy successor to his enormously prosperous and Oscar winning Rainman&apos;. Although adopting the box office disaster strategy  no stars just talent&apos;, Levinson manages to create a small yet thoroughly incisive look at the changing face of America and its values during an eventful period in its cultural history.\n\nSet in the mid 1950&apos;s at the height of the post war economic boom and on the eve of Television&apos;s dominance of domestic life, Avalon&apos; looks closely and lovingly at the lives, loves and disasters of three generations of a Polish family in the New World. Opening with a magnificently shot flashback of Mueller-Stahl&apos;s arrival in America on July 4th some forty years earlier, the film develops a nostalgic yet never overtly sentimental approach to its subject matter and always keeps its story-line rooted firmly in reality.\n\n Although the film has no specific plot or central character, the magnificent Mueller-Stahr emerges as the principal paternal figure trying to keep his increasingly disparate family of brothers, children, nephews, nieces and sundry together amidst the turning tides of cultural change. Joan Plowright plays his stubborn wife who has never learned to fully adapt to the lifestyles in the West, while his son Aidan Quinn is trying desperately to cash in on the American dream that brought his father to those shores in the first place. \n\nA tale told with great colour, character and humour and populated with a huge assortment of human characters and memorable moments, &apos;Avalon&apos; is a beautifully composed piece of American cinema.",

It&apos;s kinda cheesy and it&apos;s not exactly Oscar-worthy, but Tom Selleck is pretty convincing as a struggling major leaguer who is traded to a Japanese team. If you&apos;ve seen all the new releases (except Thin Red Line, which you should avoid like the plague) and you&apos;re looking for something light-hearted and entertaining, this movie is a safe bet. Enjoy.. and GO DODGERS!!! (yes they&apos;re struggling now, but i can feel a comeback)"

It follows group of characters intricately woven together; describing each personality by themselves and with respect to the other characters. The movie may be described as a beautiful documentation on basics of human nature, with many folds; and every time one watches it, discovers a new dimension. Ray&apos;s films interact with the audience in a way that, anyone can perceive them, and Kanchenjungha is no exception to that. What is it about these picturesque snow-capped hills that make one ponder into reflections, which has no space for, in life typically? Unlike the popular understanding the various characters are not shown to &quot;evolve&quot;. Rather surrounded by innocence and beauty of the Darjeeling hills, together each of Ray&apos;s characters unfurl gradually into a culmination. Every scene in this film has an element of Darjeeling included, such as the unseen bird call, or animals that pass by, or the locals adorn in their tradition. With the sunrays that playing hide-n-seek through the clouds, the Darjeeling mists dances around, only to clear out in the end. It is as if the mountains itself fashions the individuals to reveal themselves, to speak out. Then and only then would the fog clear and you can see &quot;the most beautiful snow range in the world&quot; In then end Kanchenjunga can be summed up into one word as &quot;perfect&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "this film seems to be divided into two parts, the one is the martial arts, political part, which is cool and the other is the love story which is far too sappy.\n\nthe plot is simultaneously thin as paper yet so convoluted as to be incomprehensible, starting with the main character&apos;s nose. the story runs something along the lines of &quot;Hero comes from ancient dynasty, knows martial arts secrets, and is in love with a forbidden woman. meanwhile said woman is key to labyrinthine politics involving Mongolian warlords, Chinese Warlords, corrupt officials and everything in between.&quot; the double crosses go on endlessly, until it&apos;s rather tricky to tell who the hell is betraying who. meanwhile the whole tepid &quot;I loved you once but now you&apos;re a murderer, No i&apos;m not you betrayed our love&quot; thing drags on.\n\nthe fight scenes are fantastically choreographed but poorly shot. characters fly at each other and slash in a graceful sword dance, but the camera tries to match their acrobatics, resulting in an eye hurting riot of movement. the hero&apos;s undefeatable signature move (i almost expected him to cry out &quot;Hado-Ken&quot; whenever he uses it) is used way too often, and leaves every fight with a predictable close. it&apos;s other problem is that fight scenes are scattered liberally throughout the film, with no correlation between the quality of a fight and its importance, so many of the best fights (an incredible scene as the hero&apos;s war band descends on an enemy fort) are used on the most mundane plot points, with average fights for the more important scenes (including a terribly weak climatic fight). the other problem is that since the hero&apos;s fighting style is so effective (even without the street fighter style finishing move) that he uses the same moves in every fight, with little to no variation, all the fights end up shockingly repetitive.\n\nmeanwhile the hero alternates between a quivering lipped softie, and stony faced mannequin. one of the villains fairs much better, and, annoyingly, wins our sympathy far more effectively than the hero does.\n\nthis may sound an unfair blasting of the film, and i wish i could sound more even handed, but the film could seriously have used some comic relief (one joke in two hours is not too much to ask) some editing (way too much sepia toned slow motion) and just some good old fashioned still cameras (ones that didn&apos;t back flip with fight scene) my rating 5/10, potential but mostly squandered",

      "reviewBody": "Claude Lanzmann filmed this interview in 1979 to be part of his Holocaust documentary, &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), but couldn&apos;t fit it into the overall structure of the film. Nearly two decades later, this interview became its own documentary, a sixty-five-minute postscript to the massive &quot;Shoah.&quot; It stands on its own.\n\nLanzmann interviews Maurice Rossel, a Swiss official of the International Red Cross during World War II. Rossel first talks about his unofficial visit to the Auschwitz camp where the skeletal prisoners looked on him as if he were a &quot;visitor from the living.&quot; Then he describes his visit to Theresienstadt.\n\nTheresienstadt was a farce, a death camp for Jews tricked up as a model ghetto. Rossel&apos;s job was to inspect the camp and issue a report on what he found. He found it largely favorable.\n\nRossel comments on how unpleasantly he was struck by the obvious VIP status of the Jewish prisoners, then how unstomachably servile and docile they seemed. He says that despite ample opportunity no one slipped him a note, whispered a message, or did anything to indicate the ghetto was a sham.\n\nAfter coaxing Rossel&apos;s side of the story, Lanzmann gives his own. According to his research, Rossel&apos;s visit was carefully planned. The prisoners were rehearsed for months on how to behave and what to say. Prisoners were forbidden to salute a Nazi during the one-day visit, an otherwise mandatory obeisance. A bandstand and a children&apos;s playground were erected immediately before the visit and torn down immediately afterward.\n\nLanzmann tells Rossel how his report conflicted with the facts. Rossel reported the prisoners were properly fed when in fact they were starving. He estimated the number of deaths as dozens per day (as if that weren&apos;t enough) when in fact it was thousands. His only criticism was the overcrowding. He didn&apos;t know the half of it: five-thousand prisoners were removed to Auschwitz and executed shortly before his arrival.\n\nA discussion period followed the screening I attended, and one man said he found Lanzmann to be insufferably smug. The Nazis, he said, were good at fooling people; surely they would have conned Lanzmann himself had he been the one to tour Theresienstadt. Another man reminded him of a key moment in the interview: Lanzmann asks Rossel if, knowing everything he does now, he would have written the same report. Rossel says yes, he would have.\n\nHe was willfully blind during the tour and remained so decades later.\n\nLittle can be said for this documentary as a film. We see a talking head occasionally interspersed with traveling shots of Theresienstadt as it looked decades after the war. This is just an unadorned look at the machinery of evil  as represented by one cog."

Other notable points, sometimes the video looks like it&apos;s shot with a cheap handycam, the sound is awful when they&apos;re inside, the acting is painful...there&apos;s basically zero plot, fine, I can deal with it (I knew it was an action movie when I rented it) , I&apos;ll fast forward to the action... 5 minutes fast forwarding at 30x speed.. no action... another 2 minutes, finally! an action scene! Back to normal speed, and... what a disappointment. There&apos;s no real fight, just some shadowing stuff and then a guy jumps through a candy glass door. Wow... take that Ninja assassin!! 30 seconds later, I&apos;m off the couch and back on my way to the video store to demand a refund or replacement. The rental clerk says, we usually don&apos;t do exchanges.. I explain how bad it was to him and that I only watched about 15 minutes before turning it off, so he makes an exception. He says next time just say it&apos;s scratched or something. I think to myself, If I&apos;d scratched the DVD, I would have been doing the world a huge favor!!",

I tagged along with a group of friends who are die-hard horror/thriller fans, while myself I tend to steer away from the genre, mainly because it&apos;s a genre that has seen it all. \n\nBut I found Needle to be highly enjoyable, a device that allows a killer to kill their victims without physically killing them is a highly refreshing concept.\n\nWhile I would of loved to have something more in the deaths (after the first two dying similar deaths) it still captivated me as I tried to work out who was picking apart this group of friends and why (I genuinely didn&apos;t pick the killer till the reveal at the end). \n\nThe cinematography was fantastic and was surprised to learn that it was actually a horror film produced entirely in Australia. Well worth seeing, can&apos;t wait to take my girlfriend to it and watch her squirm at the deaths! ☺",

While the story line and plot structure are very creative and innovative, the way the story was portrayed was less than commendable. Many parts of the film seem overtly sexual and as if they were created for fetish more than to add to the film. There were multiple parts of the film like this, which made it seem more like pornography than a legitimate film starring females. I think this film would&apos;ve been much better without the extreme efforts to seem &quot;weird&quot;, and also without the overuse of pointless and explicit sexuality."

PUTV is the best teen drama out there (though there aren&apos;t many to compete with it), it really grasps how so alone some teenagers can feel and how rejectedby the system they so often are. The film has dated some what, but if there ever was an early warning sign of the problems that face American schools today (columbine esque) this is it. You can only push teenagers so far before they lose the plot, end up killing themselves or other people, PUTV is about those feelings. Slater is the bomb in this film, he is truly awesome and Mathis plays a great sidekick. The fact she shows a bit of flesh makes the movie highly genuine, yes girls do get naked with boys whilst at high school. PUTV does now suffer with its meaning to the modern era, but modern kids still do get dejected and rejected and this film is a great message in saying.... You Are Not Alone! 10/10 Then.... 8/10 Now.",

It was heavier on the biography part and not as much a retrospective of performance bits. That was perfectly fine because this documentary was more about the man and what drove his comedy. Also, it appears Bill Hicks was an incredible blues guitarist from the few audio clips played. Most of the beginning is about his family and upbringing which sourced his early comedy. It also described his friendships and the relationships that led him into comedy. Towards the end, more of Bill Hick&apos;s comedy is performed, but more to emphasize the circumstances of his life and how he managed his career.\n\nBill Hicks will always be one of my favorite comedians, and to see the man behind the comedy was fascinating. I have a deeper appreciation of the man and his work after seeing this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Back in the mid-&apos;60s, Diana Rigg was probably responsible for jump-starting the puberties of millions of baby boomer boys, thanks to her portrayal of Emma Peel in the hit BBC program &quot;The Avengers.&quot; At any rate, along with Anne Francis&apos; turn on &quot;Honey West&quot; and just about every woman in the first five Bond movies, she was certainly responsible for jump-starting mine, and I love watching her in anything she does even today, almost 40 years later. (Seeing her &quot;Medea&quot; on Broadway in 1994 was especially satisfying.) In &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; (1969), Diana plays a British (natch) freelance reporter in turn-of-the-century London who infiltrates Oliver Reed&apos;s titular organization (a sort of political Murder Inc.) and hires him to put a hit on...himself! Thus starts a series of wild and woolly escapades, as Reed races all over Europe trying to kill his organization&apos;s principals, before they can do away with him. We get tongue-in-cheek episodes (filmed all over Europe, and with lavish production values) involving a Parisian brothel, a Swiss bank, the beer halls of Vienna and the canals of Venice, all culminating in a fierce, exciting battle on an airborne, primitive zeppelin, with the fate of the Continent hanging in the balance. The film moves along very briskly and is quite entertaining, and Curt Jergens and Telly Savalas (who starred with Rigg that same year in &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot;) add delicious supporting performances. Diana, need I say, looks absolutely gorgeous, especially when shown in those frilly undergarment and bathtub scenes. Featuring a literate, witty script and consistently amusing and inventive situations, &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; is a real treat indeed. And Diana Rigg&apos;s exquisite presence is the yummy icing on an already tasty cake.",

But now, the sequel is more serious and headlines action star Brent Huff as a commando who is in search of his old old Vietnam buddy Richard Harris (!). Harris, a very masterful actor looks puzzled why he is even in this film (he said once in a interview he retired until they offered him THE FIELD, so this movie must have motivated his retirement!).  Harris looks very ill in the film, and suprisingly he is most of the film unlike Mary Starvin who is second bills (Harris is 3rd billed) who seems to have little to do. Not bad action scenes, and even has Harris killing a giant fake bug.  Huff is good as usual, but this film steals the ending of RAMBO 2 just  like first STRIKE COMMANDO film. The film does looks depressing, and it&apos;s kind of sad to see Harris in a Philipeno shot cheap film, and on a role that Bo Svenson to Henry Silva usual does."

      "reviewBody": "First, the bad news: Vanessa Paradis has announced her intention of returning to the screen. The good news is even she can&apos;t ruin this divertissement. Patrice Leconte doesn&apos;t like to repeat himself and he clearly decided it was time he climbed aboard the &apos;Our Man Flint/Matt Helm&apos; bandwagon and laid a spoof thriller on us. The movie is referential to the nth degree because audiences are supposed to have seen or at least be very much aware that Delon and Belmondo enjoyed a mega smash some thirty years ago with &apos;Borsalino&apos; in which they played Marseilles-based hoods. Those who know and dug the original will feel a frisson when the Borsalino &apos;theme&apos; strikes up, those who don&apos;t won&apos;t care either way. The plot, such as it is, hinges on the Paradis character and Oh, how much better it would have been without this Goldie Hawn look-alike and play alike - all big round saucer eyes and the galloping cutes which is calculated to make cases of male arrested development roll over and play dead. Here she plays a car thief just out of the slammer after her dear old mom has gone to the big jump lead in the sky but not before leaving a cassette tapping either Delon or Belmondo as the biological father of Paradis. So, off she goes to find them, via a boosted car which just happens to belong to the Russian mafia who are not best pleased. She locates both Delon and Belmondo who are more or less forced to team up and take on the mafia - that&apos;s right, two over-the-hill hard men against god-knows-how-many nasty men. It&apos;s not all blowing up casinos and throwing heavies off cliffs cos in between we get lotsa laffs - think Duke Wayne and Bob Mitchum in &apos;El Dorado&apos; and you&apos;re getting there. This is French so even the mayhem is done stylishly. Go see, enjoy. 8/10"

The female character Roopa (Nargis) makes you imagine of a girl who don&apos;t know the accurate path but thinks herself as she is doing right due to her her blind trust on everyone. The problems with misunderstanding a person is another element in the story. Ashok Babu (Ashok Kumar) is portrayed as a guide for Roopa to begin and end her good life. Raj (Raj Kapoor) may confuse you till the mid-half unless the three gangsters enter the scene and make you realise the reality. The paintings displayed in this movie have relevance until the climax which makes art work an essential ingredient in the story.\n\nThis movie was short when compared to other films of the lead actors. It should have been little more extended because this short film confines Ashok Kumar&apos;s role to a mere advisor and a secret lover. Some dream songs of Ashok Kumar was a must that would have shown his love more openly rather than alloting majority of songs to Raj which of course will not make you feel emotional (while listening to songs) if you have watched it. Instead of showing Ashok as only a silent artist, he should also have been shown as a singer so that the songs could be made more romantic.",

      "reviewBody": "Surely nobody goes into this laughable cheese-fest expecting to see a quality horror film. Even by Italian standards - Bava and Argento excepted - this is utter nonsense. The horror part is well, what horror part? The plot is utterly predictable, no surprises there. The dialog is just as predictable. As for the scenery we are treated to some spectacular vistas (they caught my wife&apos;s fancy long enough to pause in passing and in her determination to avoid taking part in my passion for horrible films) and the castle where the action takes place is really cool! So what else is there to recommend this? It&apos;s all about perfect bodies, a good number of them, enough to keep members of both sexes entertained. Mickey Hargitay who plays our villain has, as he so proudly informs the audience often enough, THE perfect body. He puts the rest of us puny males to shame with the utter certainty that no matter how hard we try we&apos;ll never reach that level of physical beauty. On the other side of the gender barrier the women are equally gorgeous. They are all curvaceous, luscious, mouth-watering eye candy to awaken the man-beast in every male out there. Bear in mind there is no real nudity. The closest we get to risqué scenes is just the hint of the top part of nipples. Otherwise it&apos;s all designed to tantalize the male spectator with the prospect of revealing the hidden parts without doing so. How delicious! Well, perhaps not for recently pubescent and inexperienced teens. For them it might be too frustrating.\n\nOne final point. The hero is the exact opposite of our gorgeous villain. A Joe Pesci look-alike, he&apos;s not exactly my idea of a hero and he in fact gets beat up pretty regularly until he finally prevails with strategic karate chops. Makes you wonder why he doesn&apos;t use them before he gets punched out within an inch of his life, but I digress. The heroine is clearly above his league in the looks department but also not as sexy or exotic as any one of the other four women. So I&apos;m not sure but maybe the producers were trying to insert a moral about looks and death but who knows? Any way you look at it this movie will keep you chuckling and salivating neither of which is a bad thing.",

Among other things, Shulgin secured the abdication of the Tsar, was a political adviser to the Whites during the civil war, and then to General Vlasov, who set up an anti-Soviet military force during the Second World War. Shulgin was captured by Soviet forces in 1945, and spent the next couple of decades in prison.\n\nThe interviewer takes him through his life, with archival footage.\n\nBecause Shulgin is far more intelligent and charming than his (Communist) interviewer, he has the best of every argument. The film was briefly shown in the Moscow cinemas at the end of 1965, but was taken off when the authorities realised its subversive nature.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie actually took me by surprise.\n\nFirst of all, let me start off by saying that the story is so compelling and spellbinding that it will blow you away. There is just something about this movie that is so unique in every way.\n\nThe characters in this movie are so fantastically unique, quirky and lovable. It all just came together for a greater unity. The role of Louis Ives (played by Paul Dano) was the quirkiest of all, struggling to find his place in life, dealing with his sexuality and the admiration of Henry and trying to find acceptance. And I must admit that Paul Dano portrayed his character in a very good way; he was awesome in this movie. And his resemblance to a young Liam Neeson is just uncanny.\n\nMoving on to the role of Henry Harrison (played by Kevin Kline), well his role was eccentric and strict. But, as usual, Kline put on a magnificent performance. He is very charismatic and have a good voice. He is indeed one of the better actors of recent times.\n\nAnd also, not forgetting, the strange character of Gershon Gruen (played by John C. Reilly) was also very memorable and lovable, especially his voice.\n\nIn all fairness, then this movie worked so good on all levels. However, I think that a share of people might be put off by the movie, as it does have that certain epic cinema moment to it, and also dealing with (and I use this term in lack of better) sexually deviant behavior. For me, I found that aspect of the movie to be one of the driving factors, because it showed how Louis Ives was struggling to find himself and dealing with his needs.\n\nThe movie is very beautiful in more than one way. The story is beautiful, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is beautiful, and so forth. This is one of the better movies I have seen in a while. It is a fresh breath of change in the movie scene for me. Nice with a movie that stands out from the mainstream comedies, and dares to be so unique as it is.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t already seen &quot;The Extra Man&quot;, then you owe it to yourself to do so, especially if you are (like me) a lover of the cinema and movies. This is a story that will stay with you for a long, long time.\n\nThumbs up, way, way up from me!",

This movie is the movie lovers movie and shows all it is worth with movie references, spoofs (The movie as a whole is not a spoof) and a few twists from movies previously made. The show is so mindbreakingly clever and witty that after wards the viewer is left with a very happy feeling that they viewed something worth seeing. The film is hilarious for 1 even 2 views and is SO much better then other crap coming out nowadays. I do not want to tell you the end but it is worth it as there is 2 or 3 twists you will NOT see.Overall a fan of movies will love this and even a person who ONCE a week sits down for a movie will enjoy this cinematic Masterpiece. I rate this film 82%.",

      "reviewBody": "Reading through the reviews on here, I can only assume that the humour in this film was wasted on a lot of people. Boxing is one of the few sports that translates well into the movies, with there being a decent number of great films based around the sport. This is slightly different to most however, as it takes a very humorous, cynical approach. There are so many memorable scenes and lines in the movie, right from the opening scene it&apos;s spot-on and I really can&apos;t work out where this criticism of the direction stems from! The fight scenes are over quickly and are nothing like the real thing - obviously - it&apos;s a comedy, not a documentary (sigh).\n\nLike I said, I can only assume that the biting satire has been wasted on some viewers who were clearly expecting something different from the film. Each to their own, the film seems to have missed it&apos;s audience, but a 5 or 6 out of ten it certainly isn&apos;t! For me, it&apos;s definitely one of the better comedies out there. It&apos;s sharp, funny and well worth watching. 8 out of 10.",

Donning a jacket with their own motorcycle club logo they manage to partially ingratiate themselves with the group and then proceed to coerce them into riding to Las Vegas. What the Hell&apos;s Angels don&apos;t realize is that these two brothers have a secret plan which carries a great amount of risk for all concerned. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it had a bit more mystery than most &quot;biker films&quot; out there and tended to get better as the movie progressed. Admittedly, the acting wasn&apos;t exactly top-notch but even so it was adequate enough. Likewise, there were a couple of scenes toward the end which seemed a bit too unbelievable but that&apos;s typical of Hollywood I suppose. In any case, I thought that this was a solid biker movie and because of that I rate it as about average.",

And, just for the record, it is the first Yugoslav movie in color.\n\nThe main thing about this movie is its humor. I&apos;m afraid that non-Serbian-speaking folks wouldn&apos;t be able to appreciate it, because it depends heavily on the language. But if you do understand, I can guarantee that you&apos;ll wear a smile on your face throughout the movie.\n\nAnother thing is Soja Jovanović&apos;s incredible talent to capture Vojvodinian way of life. Everywhere you look you see authentic images. She also made a TV series with different set of actors 25 years later, and it is just as good.",

      "reviewBody": "Kevin Tenney directed two respectable horror films (WITCHBOARD and NIGHT OF THE DEMONS) prior to this, which confuses me. Neither of the two prior flicks were masterpieces, but they were competently made with fairly good actors and a veneer of professionalism, which makes this cinematic millstone a giant question mark. One would think that Tenney had a handle on how to do things like create atmosphere, rising action and suspense, elicit good performances out of his actors, etc. Nuh-uh. With this movie, Tenney seems to have had a cinematic aneurysm, losing any sense of how to make a professional, polished product.\n\nWhile the movie doesn&apos;t suffer from technical ineptness, there&apos;s an amateur quality to the whole thing that makes it feel almost like a 1970s drive-in movie. Oddball camera angles (the opening scene could make you seasick--watch it and you&apos;ll know what I mean), stiff or non-professional acting, lengthy exposition dumps, and dialogue that is in turns wooden or ingratiatingly cute, and little action until the third act all make for an annoying viewing experience. Still, it can be charming if you&apos;re in the right mood. Linnea Quigley is the only name actor I could spot, and her nude scene was a blessing in the midst of all this mediocrity. The actresses playing the psychic investigator and physical medium both came off to me as non-professional or poorly trained (the investigator in particular desperately needed some vocal or dialect training--her accent was annoying). The actors playing the two cops-for-hire were ok, but the constant one-liners they delivered got irritating pretty quick. The movie picked up steam near the end with some better than average special effects (which is probably where most of the budget went), which was a welcome relief from all the tedious exposition. Lovers of bad movies might want to try this one, but all others would do well to select something else to watch on Tubi.",

But I am pleased to report that my headline is accurate, because &quot;Souls At Sea&quot; is a very interesting story about a subject barely touched upon in Hollywood&apos;s long, colorful history. Reading through other reviewers takes on the film, it qualifies more accurately as a semi-historical drama, although not the first story Hollywood has taken liberties with. The temptation is to call &quot;Souls At Sea&quot; a &apos;seafaring yarn&apos;, but, as I said, it is heavy on talk and light on second unit work.\n\nIn any case, this offbeat movie has Gary Cooper faced with a moral dilemma as an abolitionist involved in the slave trade in the middle of the 19th century. His sidekick is George Raft, in as sympathetic a role as he ever had and one of his best acting jobs (never one of his strong points). Frances Dee is an ingenue on board the ship in question, and George Zucco plays a good guy for a change. Particularly effective is the background music which won an AA nomination for composer Milan Roder. Henry Wilcoxon is an effective bad guy and Olympe Bradna, whose film appearances were too few, is touching as a maidservant and love interest for George Raft. \n\nVery well done, as is the norm with a Henry Hathaway picture. The story is so absorbing that the viewer nearly forgets about the lack of action scenes, and is well worth my rating of seven."

I haven&apos;t felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in quite some time.\n\nI&apos;m a BIG fan of the &quot;Walking With...&quot; series, including it&apos;s Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other docs from the series, I figured I need to see this one as well, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.\n\nWell for those of you who put up a good review of this doc... what were you thinking?! lol.\n\nThough the information that they were able to get through was interesting, the presentation failed in every other way possible. It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place), horrible effects (that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects), and overused MTV-style camera effects.\n\nSpeaking of the makeup effects, one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie. Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.\n\nThe worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks remotely real. It doesn&apos;t even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in &quot;Walking With Dinosaurs&quot; of the fate of the Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. It&apos;s this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. When you are more engaged in the subject and it&apos;s own personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it.\n\nThe only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh (which I did frequently, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong on the shelf with the other &quot;Walking With...&quot; docs.\n\nAnd does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm...",

      "reviewBody": "At the end of the war years his character, Charles, is a writer for the Stars and Stripes, and wants to continue a career in journalism. He meets James Ellswirth (Walter Pidgeon), an aging member of the lost generation, and his two grown daughters. There is level headed Marion (Donna Reed) and frisky flirtatious Helen (Elizabeth Taylor).\n\nCharles and Marion are first an item, but then Helen steals him away from her own sister. Marion settles down with somebody else. That is to say, she settles for someone else. Houses tend to settle, and it&apos;s usually no fun to watch. But I digress.\n\nThen the barren worthless oil fields that James gave Charles and Helen as a wedding present come in big time and suddenly Charles and Helen are fabulously wealthy and they transform into a second lost generation in the tradition of dear old dad, except this time with the money to make a really big mess of their lives. Charles quits his job and just becomes a huge drunken womanizing jerk, feeling sorry for himself because all of his rejection from publishers. This is where we get to the hard to believe part. I just don&apos;t buy Van Johnson as this tortured yet shallow soul. Louis B. Mayer, when he was redecorating MGM after Irving Thalberg&apos;s death, specifically hired Johnson because of his easy, song and dance man&apos;s likability and uncomplicated face. The part cries out for Kirk Douglas or maybe even better - Montgomery Clift.\n\nA huge tragedy ensues, and Marion, taking time off from settling, comes back into the picture to make things even worse. Who do I really feel sorry for in this film full of unlikeable characters? Marion&apos;s husband, who at the end, finally figures out he&apos;s been settled for all of these years. You can see it in his face. And if that face looks familiar, it&apos;s because the actor is the father of Monkee Mickey Dolenz.",

      "reviewBody": "Visconti&apos;s credit as director of this short documentary is a misstatement. There isn&apos;t a trace of Visconti&apos;s elaborate artistry here and he&apos;s obviously not directing anything; what we see are making-of-ish images of Visconti looking grave, tired and slightly bored as he travels around Europe (Munich, Budapest, Warsaw, Venice, Helsinki and Stockholm) with a small crew in the winter of 1970, looking for a 12-year-old boy to play the emblematic role of Tadzio in his adaptation of Thomas Mann&apos;s novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. Visually unpolished (to put it nicely), &quot;Alla Ricerca di Tadzio&quot; plays like a TV newsreel, with a voice-over commentary full of grandiloquent remarks on Visconti&apos;s oeuvre and excerpts of Mann&apos;s physical description of Tadzio. The commentary is at odds with the images: the pompous words don&apos;t match the improvised auditions in small hotel rooms with self-conscious, inexperienced young boys, most of them bluntly dismissed by Visconti with a grunt, a few of them earning &quot;compliments&quot; like &quot;hmm, yes, pretty face&quot;. \n\nEspecially ludicrous is Visconti&apos;s disappointment with Polish boys (remember Tadzio was Polish in the novella -- and in real life). Unable to find in Warsaw the Greek/Nordic living statue he is searching for -- described by Mann as the 12-year-old owner of graceful body, golden hair framing a noble head with blue eyes, straight nose, majestic presence, a sort of preteen reincarnation of Antinous -- he blames the demise of Polish aristocracy through successive periods of war in Poland for the rather &quot;proletarian&quot; appearance of the young Poles: a VERY politically-incorrect comment by that walking paradox Visconti (a Marxist aristocrat!)\n\nVisconti&apos;s insistence on a Tadzio that would perfectly match Mann&apos;s description seems rather obnoxious: if he took significant liberties with Gustav von Aschenbach and the novella itself (not only by making Aschenbach a composer instead of writer, but also by borrowing passages and characters from Doktor Faustus, especially Carole André&apos;s Esmeralda), why was he so particular about Tadzio&apos;s physique?\n\nWell, it turned out he couldn&apos;t be THAT particular after all, because in a Stockholm hotel suite a miracle happens: enter Björn Andrésen for an audition and it&apos;s like the midnight sun broke into the chilly room. Unmistakably Scandinavian in his perfect blond beauty, chiseled features, long limbs and gazelle-like grace, he&apos;s older than Tadzio by two or three years, taller than expected and hasn&apos;t REMOTELY got a Mittel-European physique. Yet, his audition is nothing short of spectacular: he faces -- well, nearly melts -- the camera with such bold, precocious sexiness and complete self-confidence you can feel the room temperature rise; he&apos;s a natural, born to be stared at. Visconti realizes he&apos;s got something extraordinary and orders him to take off his shirt (it was the 70s, folks). Björn reacts with an incredulous expression as in &quot;did I hear right?&quot;, only to sportingly acquiesce a few moments later with a knock-out smile. Even if Björn seems alarmingly aware there&apos;s something obviously wrong in being photographed by middle-aged men in mid-winter in a hotel room wearing nothing but briefs, his spontaneous, fantastic appeal shines through entirely -- it&apos;s all there, he IS the perfect Tadzio even before Visconti&apos;s direction. The rest is movie history.\n\nIn 2005, Björn Andresen turned 50 (oh time, time...) and gave a few interviews -- you know the sadistic game of the press, &quot;let&apos;s see how old and used up he looks now!!&quot;. And so he complained how he felt abused by Visconti, who took him to gay bars and parties to &quot;publicize him&quot;, exposing him to the gay scene when he was barely 15, turning him into a gay icon overnight, which made Andrésen -- a heterosexual teenager -- understandably confused and rebellious. Furthermore, he states that Visconti never again employed him as an actor or helped him get acting jobs. Feeling traumatized by the whole experience, Björn went on to make a few minor Swedish movies, got married, faced the tragic death of his baby child by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, experimented with drugs and alcohol, is now out of work as an actor and trying to make a living as a piano player...in other words, a troubled life of unfulfilled promises. His face doesn&apos;t bear a single trace left of his former beauty, he now looks haggard, prematurely wasted, deeply wrinkled, completely unrecognizable. But despite the fact the he wasn&apos;t the Tadzio Visconti originally had in mind (was Visconti looking for a 12-year-old Helmut Berger?), Björn Andresen will forever be -- for better or worse -- the one and only embodiment of Tadzio for all of us moviegoers. More than that: since the opening of &quot;Death in Venice&quot; in 1971 it has become impossible to read the novella and not think of Andrésen as THE incarnation of perfect pubescent male beauty haunting Thomas Mann&apos;s alter-ego Gustav von Aschenbach.\n\n&quot;Alla Ricerca di Tadzio&quot; ends with a commentary that is objectionable and disrespectful -- and scary. The narrator declares in a bombastic tone: &quot;Visconti has found at last his Tadzio in Björn Andrésen. But why should we still call him Björn? From this moment on he is simply Tadzio, and that&apos;s that -- È TADZIO E BASTA!&quot;. If you see this documentary today, you&apos;ll feel chills up your spine when you hear that last remark, that turned out to be a prophecy -- and a curse.",

Some of the most tremendous artists of the 60&apos;s all join together to have a mobile party that ran across Canada. The movie includes some amazing footage of Janis Joplin, members of The Band, and a lot of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir. I was curious where the remainder of the Grateful Dead spent much of their train time, but the footage shown was enlightening enough. From a night with LSD laden whiskey where spirits and the music was VERY high, to onstage performances by many of the groups from the actual concerts, and promoters and band members discussing the concerns about unruly fans and city managers. There was at least one huge aspect to note. For those of you who may appreciate Joplin for who she was and the influence she had but, maybe, aren&apos;t huge aficionados of her music, you may gain a new respect. Her onstage presence was clearly electrifying. You could tell that whenever she was belting out her bluesy tones, she had every bit of her heart bleeding out of her entire being. It would be a wondrous day to find that this, plus more and more hours of the footage could be released. I would waste away for an entire day watching and enjoying every tidbit of what was collected.",

In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn&apos;t cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn&apos;t bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.\n\nMy one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can&apos;t figure out why.",

Not just because of the countryside aspect. Were no more in the damp swamps of Vietnam, but the dry lands of Mediterranean countries. Here is just the ugly truth. No black and white, grey, like the uniforms covered of dust. That&apos;s a great aspect of this movie. They just show ordinary men becoming Beast. Because it&apos;s war, because war is ugly, because this wasn&apos;t an ordinary war. It&apos;s deeply based on true facts, like this former Resistant using torture, despite having being tortured himself while a resistant. Or those two Algerian mates, who used to fight in the Monte Casino against the German... and then one of them kill the other, because they&apos;re in two different side, and one of them had his family killed by the other one&apos;s friends. And the fellagas using ugly means, because there&apos;s no other mean to free your country. I was more shaken by this movie than I was by any Vietnam movies. Because, well, maybe, Terrien, he could just have been me."

      "reviewBody": "Where do these good reviews come from? With words and phrases like &quot;accomplished,&quot; &quot;mesmerizing,&quot; &quot;visually stunning,&quot; &quot;reminds me of the best moments from Blade runner and 2001,&quot; &quot;Astin acts his heart out.&quot; Sounds to me like some PR people are doing damage control on the old IMDb in the hopes they can salvage some kind of life for this film on DVD. &quot;I can&apos;t believe it wasn&apos;t theatrically released.&quot; Well, I can, and we should thank the studio execs who decided to give this movie a basic cable burial. They did so to preserve social harmony. If the general public had paid box office price to watch Slipstream, riots would have surely ensued.\n\nMake no mistake, people, this movie is BAD. The amazing directorial technique some seem to be so inexplicably impressed by is nothing but hack. Slow motion is used to signal the slowing down of time before a backwards trip, but it&apos;s also just used any old time to signify nothing other than the total running time needed to be longer to qualify as a feature-length film. Then there&apos;s the rotating camera. Why use the technique so much? Well they bought the rig, and darn it, they were going to use it. Stupid, horribly staged bank shootout? No worries, we&apos;ve got a rotating camera. Stupid, horribly written and acted bus bathroom scene? No worries, we&apos;ve got a rotating camera. And here&apos;s a dilemma, we&apos;ve got two versions of a scene, one with the actors inside a car and one where they&apos;re outside, both are horribly written and acted, but we forgot to use the rotating camera. What do we do? No worries, we&apos;ll just inter-cut the two separate takes, and the lack of continuity will jar the stupider viewers into thinking that we &quot;have a visual style.&quot; Yeah, that&apos;s right, I&apos;ve been saying horribly acted. No one, in this movie is a great actor, by which I mean, has a great range. To the Astinites out there, sorry, but your boy is a serviceable actor at best. Without an extraordinary director and extraordinary writing, the mediocrity of Astin&apos;s performance is an unbearable distraction. He&apos;s had the good fortune to be in a few good movies in his career, but, left to his own devices, he will pick insipid little things like Slipstream simply because the script uses the phrase, &quot;String Theory.&quot; This is a dangerous trait for a less-than amazing actor to possess. If he wises up, he will accept the role of supporting, character actor with grace. He cannot and should not attempt to carry a film.\n\nTo give a little credit to the actors, including Astin, there&apos;s not much you can do with writing as terrible as this. There are no character arcs to speak of, just starting points and end points. How did they get there? What&apos;s the motivation? Who could be that stupid? Who cares! Have you seen our rotating camera? And, to all you aspiring directors, when faced with a script with no feeling and actors phoning it in, don&apos;t forget to use slow-motion. It saves the writer from having to write something compelling and the actor from having to emote. The slower you get it, the more emotional weight a scene can carry. And if you manage to have a rotating camera with slow-motion, whoa boy! Oscar can&apos;t be far behind. Or at the very least, a BAFTA.\n\nI&apos;ve never, before watching Slipstream, felt it my duty to so harshly trash a film on the internet. I registered with IMDb because of it. Believe it or not, this is me at my most humanistic. Mankind should not have to watch this movie. If I can prevent one person, then I&apos;ve done my part to make a better world.\n\nFor the love of all that is good, go rent Donny Darko and stay far away from the abomination known as Slipstream.",

The cast is great, and I&apos;m glad they cast actors who actually look like teenagers, instead of actors in their 20s. I&apos;m also glad the movie had some serious moments, because it makes all the antics and events all the more realistic.\n\nThese serious moments are the best parts of the movie. Unfortunately, a lot of them seem undernourished - I have to agree with a writer of an earlier user comment that this movie seems to have been cut down in the editing room. As a result, many subplots seem unfinished or lacking detail, and this includes the characters of some of the Brothers.\n\nI enjoyed this movie a lot, but I would love to see a director&apos;s cut one day."

      "reviewBody": "The Candlemaker (1957) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nDecent animated film that&apos;s main goal is to spread to word of Jesus. The film takes place, as the narrator says, before cars or electricity. The important jobs in a small town were the butcher and the candlemaker. It&apos;s a week before Christmas and the candlemaker in town gives the most important job to his young son. The son then must create two candles that will appear in the local church. I think for the target audience this here is going to be enjoyed. I don&apos;t mind films that have major religious overtones but I just don&apos;t like being preached at. This film goes way over-the-top in the preaching department and at times the film beats its message over the viewers head. There&apos;s no question that the film has a good message to be told and this message was strong enough to where we didn&apos;t need the preaching. With that said, for the most part the animation was quite nice and the film was certainly put together well. At 13-minutes it ran on a bit too long but again, those target members of the crowd will certainly enjoy it."

      "reviewBody": "This film affected me on many emotional levels. I saw the results of the war in East and West Berlin in 1957. While in Berlin I lived with a girl my age who lost her father in the battle for Stalingrad. Her tales made my hair stand on end as he was one of the many young Germans send there to fight as a punishment for errors,(read that as failure to win), in other battle zones.\n\nIt isn&apos;t well understood, but the Eastern Front was used as a threat and as a punishment by Hitler. Even Schindler in the film Schindler&apos;s List used that threat on the train station in order to get his bookkeeper released from the death train.\n\nThere are two scenes that will haunt be for the rest of my life:\n\nThe scene where Lt. Hans von Witzland, played by a very young and splendid Thomas Kretschmann, and the Russian actress Dana Vavrova who plays Irina.\n\nThat scene is so emotionally charged that it left both actors physically shaking. I can&apos;t imagine having to repeat that scene more than once. To have to hold that raw, totally exposed feeling/expression and body language while lights are adjusted and a different angle is used must have been physically and mentally exhausting for these two brilliant actors. They perform a brutal Dance Macabre that is both horrific and fascinating. \n\nThis scene is no longer about an enemy and the one who has been conquered. It is about a young man desperate to find one moment of humanity on an endless nightmare and a young woman who hates him and herself and yet can not resolve her situation. That he is a German and she is Russian is not as important as that they are both souls in torment with no way out.\n\nThe human agony of that scene is superior to anything I have seen in over 60 years of watching movies.\n\nThe other is the final scene between Dominique Horwitz and Kretschmann as Fritz and Hans clinging to each other overwhelmed and miniaturized by the vast Russian winter.\n\nThat final scene reminds me of Napoleon&apos;s death march from Moscow in 1812. The results were to same. No enemy can come marching into Russia and live to march out again.\n\nI began watching this film firmly committed to cheering the Russians and hating the Germans.\n\nBy the end I was crying for them all.\n\nThat is the message of this fine film. War is a waste...a waste of human lives, of property, and of moral and religious focus.\n\nThis is a classic anti-war film not unlike All Quiet on the Western Front or What Price Glory.",

This film is so good it should not get a Hollywood remake for a long time , if ever.\n\ntoo bad the swiss and deutschers don&apos;t offer English subs for their homegrown produce. but in the long run that&apos;s their problem. at this point it has my vote for the best foreign film Oscar.\n\nI would put this in the category of small films that really pack a punch. harold and maude, la strada, delicatessen, and a couple of the bill forsyth films come to mind. The picture of swiss small time life is priceless and , from my own several visits there, seems to be on the money.",

The plot is barely there -- a black ops agent is betrayed and seeks revenge on her betrayers. Big whoop. The star of the show is Gina Carano kickboxing, jumping, throttling people, you name it. That is one amazing athlete there. And the fact that she was up against all men was impressive. And she has a great figure.\n\nThe film also stars Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, and Ewan McGregor, so the inexperienced Carano was surrounded by good people who didn&apos;t have much to do.\n\nThis isn&apos;t an action film up to the standards of a Bourne film, due to Soderbergh not doing much in the way of directing. It just doesn&apos;t pop. The ending is just blah.\n\nCarano is the only reason to see it, if you want to see a top-notch female kickboxer in action.",

In fact it was one of the two movies I absolutely had to see (the other one was Mirrormask).\n\nI can&apos;t say that I got what I expected. The movie proclaims itself to be a &quot;Science fiction film by Hal Harley&quot;. It is neither science fiction (unless you count Kurt Vonnegut as science fiction), nor a typical Harley film. The special effects that you expect in a science fiction are nowhere to be found. In fact, big chunks of the movie aren&apos;t even in technicolor.\n\nThe whole movie is shot with very long exposure times and frame rates reaching down to 5-10 fps, leading to a totally dreamlike look.\n\nBut enough about technicalities... &apos;As I said the movie was a surprise but a very pleasant one. Harley uses his favorite themes of alienation (this time with actual aliens) and random, but very deep personal connections. He paints a weird but very familiar world of people treating sex as a means to getting what they want -- but with a quite interesting twist. Other current subjects, like civil liberties (ie: the lack thereof) and teenage crime are also treated to a round of deep black, dripping irony.\n\nAll in all I would recommend the movie, but not as a mindless Friday-night excursion. I give it an A.",

      "reviewBody": "After solving the famous Thin Man case in New York and acquiring a trademark in the process, Nick Charles returns to San Francisco with wife Nora to spend some time with some of her family. As we learned in the initial film, Myrna Loy&apos;s parents are both deceased, but she&apos;s got one formidable aunt is Jessie Ralph and a cousin with a wayward husband in Elissa Landi.\n\nElissa prevails upon Myrna to get Bill to locate her husband who&apos;s been missing for a few days. Powell and Loy do locate Alan Marshal the husband and the rat&apos;s been living it up with nightclub chanteuse Penny Singleton. Marshal&apos;s a playboy wastrel and hasn&apos;t the slightest intention of returning to home and hearth. But in the wee small hours of New Year&apos;s Day, he gets himself murdered on the streets of San Francisco and two more bodies turn up before William Powell solves the case.\n\nJames Stewart appears in this second Thin Man film as Landi&apos;s patient former boyfriend. In the films of James Stewart book, Stewart mentions that he wasn&apos;t particularly happy with his work in this film though I&apos;m sure it didn&apos;t hurt his career any. He felt it was way too much at variance with what his fans expected from him. It&apos;s reason enough to watch the film and see if you agree with Jimmy.\n\nSam Levene of the San Francisco PD isn&apos;t any brighter than Nat Pendleton of the NYPD just a little more excitable. Powell shows them up all the time so much so that you wonder why he&apos;s not made police commissioner of either city.\n\nAsta the most famous terrier in the world gets a bit more screen time than usual for animal lovers. He&apos;s got a Mrs. Asta and several pups and a black dog who keeps trying to cut in on his time. He also at one point provides the highpoint in comedy as he almost eats a clue which is in the form of a note thrown threw a window. Lots of fun as Powell and Loy try to get him to spit out the note. Handling that doggie drool soaked note musn&apos;t have been fun for Loy and Powell.\n\nAfter the Thin Man keeps up the high standards in film making set by the original Thin Man and shouldn&apos;t be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "Hands up all of those who never in a million years expect the Dirty Movie Devotee to review a kiddie flick ? Well, I guess the secret&apos;s out now. I do enjoy movies made for young audiences, as long as they don&apos;t treat youngsters like morons, the way most US major studio pap seems to do. This adaptation of a very popular children&apos;s book by local (Belgian) hot shot author Marc De Bel, of BLINKER fame (a series of highly readable novels which so far inspired two no better than okay film versions), is definitely a different kettle of fish...\n\nTriplets Lien, Fien and Sien Kriegel are hellcats in the making, forever causing havoc at school and in their immediate surroundings with regular bouts of animal torture (relax, none of it actually shown), much to the indifference of their selfish mom and alcoholic dad. An involuntary arson leads to the girls&apos; incarceration at the posh rehabilitation center of Doctor Vandenkerckhove (the inimitable Victor Löw from KARAKTER and IEDEREEN BEROEMD! making a meal out of this eminently hiss-able villain). Though the young charges are pampered around the clock, their snooping leads to some VERY disturbing conclusions as to the reasons behind the bruises on the other children&apos;s backs. To reveal more to anyone unfamiliar with the book would be a cardinal sin...\n\nLet&apos;s not mince words here. DE ZUSJES KRIEGEL is very much a horror movie, regardless of being aimed at pre-teen audiences. It touches on some very touchy subject matter (nope, I&apos;m not telling...), which might be one of the reasons local critics sharpened their knives when this movie hit Belgian theaters just in time for the Easter holidays. I for one believe that young children can and frequently do deal with possibly emotionally scarring material. To do so in context of a movie merely arms to better deal with similar problems in real life. It&apos;s not as if Disney ever gave youngsters an easy ride, killing off Bambi&apos;s mommy early on. And fairy tales have inspired some of the most nightmarish mental images known to man (or, indeed, child). This movie merely recycles many of the classic fairytale motifs concerning witches and other assorted villains. Its storyline won&apos;t offend anyone&apos;s intelligence levels with logical dramatic progress, a trio of engaging, distinctly non-cutesy female heroines (who don&apos;t turn that way at film&apos;s end either, thank goodness) and some mighty fine set pieces like a bus accident and the humdinger of a climax. Elegantly ominous soundtrack by Hans Helewaut creates a palpable sense of dread throughout. Acting has some rough spots as far as the three girls are concerned but at least they have solid screen presence. I hope this one rakes in the dough so Beliën can start working on a sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "Silent film fans are really in for a treat with this DVD. Once again, Flicker Alley has released a terrific DVD--with a nearly pristine print (very rare for a silent), some nice special features as well as two different sound tracks for this movie! Each time I see one of their films, I marvel at the amazing care they give each release--and it&apos;s the class of the industry.\n\n&quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot; is film that was a bit short on plot but is still well worth seeing. This is because the director, René Clair, did a masterful job with this movie--with great camera-work and composition throughout. Unfortunately, despite looking great the plot keeps me from giving the movie an even higher score. The problem is that although the story is entertaining, it just had too many holes--too many situations that simply were too hard to believe and could have EASILY been resolved...but weren&apos;t.\n\nThe film begins with a bridegroom traveling by horse and buggy to his wedding. On the way, he gets out and his horse keeps walking--and finds a straw hat that it begins to eat! Naturally, the lady who owned the hat was angry and her lover was ready to fight. The bridegroom tried to pay for it but the couple insisted he find a replacement hat. And, they follow him into town and continue to insist--even moving into his apartment and threatening to destroy the place unless he get an identical hat. It turns out it&apos;s because the woman is married to a different man and doesn&apos;t want to have to explain to him what happened to the hat. But why the couple squatted for many hours in the house seemed forced--and why the bridegroom didn&apos;t just go to the police made no sense either. But, it did have lots of cute and mildly funny moments--even if the story just made no sense.\n\nOverall, the film is expertly filmed but inconsequential because of the writing. It&apos;s worth seeing if you love silents or if you want to see a silent that manages to have very, very few intertitle cards yet tells the story very well. Otherwise, there are better silents out there--even with the great Flicker Alley package.",

But I gave it a try because many friends said it was good. This movie is about an unpopular teenage girl named Nam who has a crush on Shone, a handsome popular guy. It&apos;s fun actually to see how Nam is changing into a beautiful girl, because at first I thought it was a completely different person. And also this triangle love between Nam, Shone and Shone&apos;s friend. The ending is quite good. I recommend this movie because it&apos;s fun, not boring, and just honest. The acting is quite good. For older people and teenage boys, it&apos;s still watchable. I actually cried and laughed watching it. Enjoy the movie! Highly recommended",

Really nice outdoor and stage scenes. A real feel-good review plus comedy! And some of the greatest comedy stars of Germany at that time - including Oskar Sima, Ernst Stankovski, and the great Heinz Erhard. They all manifestly enjoy acting in this movie. Okay, this is not Almodovar, but nor is life - and if it is, thanks for wonderful entertainment like this, because one needs it even more!",

Unfortunately, that part isn&apos;t at all true. The Arrow was killed by cost overruns and the near-impossibility of developing a new plane, a new engine and a new radar system all at the same time. The geeky engineer character kind of annoyed me, too. The writers had him inventing about three things that were utterly crucial engineering and aerodynamics breakthroughs all by himself. Sorry, nobody&apos;s that good, not even the people who did that work in the first place. A lot of the people in the film are historical characters, some are composites. All in all, I really enjoyed this film, but the aviation geek in me gets irritated by factual errors.",

      "reviewBody": "One thing is for certain: you sure can&apos;t accuse Pedro Almodovar&apos;s `All About My Mother&apos; of narrative timidity.  In its relatively brief 102-minute running time, it provides a literal smorgasbord of sensational plot elements: a fatal car accident, a dead teenaged son, organ transplantation, transvestite prostitutes, lesbianism, pregnant nuns, drug addiction, AIDS, Alzheimer&apos;s, and death by childbirth  more than enough juicy elements to warm the heart of any lover of classic melodrama or daytime soap operas. Even if the film had dealt with only half of these issues, it would still be a challenge to maintain some sort of overall focus.  As it is, we spend most of the movie staring in head-scratching amazement at the sheer audacity of the enterprise.\n\nCertainly, the critics have not been stingy in heaping effusive praise on the work and both the Motion Picture Academy and the Foreign Press Golden Globe committee have echoed that praise by bestowing on the film their coveted awards for Best Foreign Language Film of 1999.  But does the film really merit all these critical hosannas and kudos?  Not by a long shot! Jaded as we may be by the deadening predictability and lack of originality that, sadly, define the majority of films released each year, it is, nevertheless, still incumbent upon us not to be bowled over by a film that takes the alternate path of undisciplined bizarreness.  `All About My Mother&apos; cries desperately to be a moving and important study of women&apos;s roles in society, but, by trying to compress so many of the eccentricities of life into one story, the film leaves us more incredulous and perplexed than stimulated and touched.\n\nOne element does succeed brilliantly, however, and that is the outstanding performance of Cecilia Roth in the leading role of Manuela, an attractive 38-year old mother who, upon the sudden death of her child, is compelled to return to the dark past she long ago fled and to seek some sort of redemption.  She provides us with the warm center of human compassion this film so desperately needs to keep it from becoming a completely clinical exercise in absurdity.  Streamlined perhaps, her story might have made for a fascinating and incisive film.  But Almodovar is so busy loading up his film with rather obviously drawn parallels that we really never believe a minute of it.  The film is rife with ineffectual and pretentious allusions to `All About Eve&apos; and `A Streetcar Named Desire,&apos; as the movie characters&apos; lives take vaguely similar paths to those of the characters found in those works.   And the finale, in which Manuela&apos;s maternal affections find a new object to latch on to, seems coy and artificial  an attempt to leave the audience on an emotional high after all the misery and heartbreak it has witnessed in the course of the film. The whole enterprise, ultimately, seems hopelessly artificial.\n\nThat artificiality at least justifies the gorgeous look of the film. Almodovar has, as always, splashed across the screen his usual array of brightly colored walls, furniture and clothing that makes the film seem to exist in a world located somewhere between realism and surrealism.  This bold visual palette is always one of the joyous fringe benefits that accompanies the watching of an Almodovar film.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case at least, he hasn&apos;t created a film with a story, cast of characters or theme to match in quality or intensity the glorious, many-hued background he provides.  Despite all its many awards and its extraordinary critical acclaim, `All About My Mother&apos; doesn&apos;t hold a candle to Almodovar&apos;s truly wonderful previous film, `Live Flesh.&apos;  Check that one out instead and see the difference."

I thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons, all of which have been well covered by other reviewers -- the moodiness, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters, and the first person view during the battle scenes.\n\nBut the element of &quot;Dark Blue World&quot; that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during combat (and this is a good thing!). While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative shots of worried spouses/girlfriends were interwoven, every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers, and viewers weren&apos;t asked to swallow unbelievable James Bond-esque pilot heroics. Instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat. As comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical (but audience pleasing) revenge based heroics.  Instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot&apos;s fate -- in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment.  We only briefly experience the pilot&apos;s breathing and the background roar of the engines as we, the audience, witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death.  And then immediately &apos;we&apos; need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival.\n\nToo often in Hollywood we&apos;re spoon-fed the emotions we&apos;re supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer&apos;s imagination.  &quot;Dark Blue World&quot; maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings.\n\nExcellent film, well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "This early film follows the exciting life of Billy Bonney . This is an interesting but flawed Western . With Robert Taylor in title role , in one of his first movies , and Donlevy as his friend and later marshal , but the movie fails to gel overall . Robert Taylor as the title character gives a decent performance . Right-handed Robert Taylor spent weeks perfecting his ability to draw a gun with his left hand in preparation for this film . Brian Donlevy as an alike-Pat Garrett is good , and Ian Hunter who plays a look-alike to Tunstall ; although some acting seem badly dated today . Sweeping and glimmer cinematography by William L. Skall . Great musical score by David Snell , including Mexican songs almost make you forget the screenplay ain&apos;t so hot . The director David Miller creates some fine action scenes , he posteriorly directed a classic Western, &apos;Lonely are the brave&apos; .\n\nOther known films about this legendary outlaw were the followings : &apos;Billy the Kid(1930)&apos; by King Vidor with John Mack Brown and Wallace Beery; &apos;The left-handed gun (1958)&apos; by Arthur Penn with Paul Newman; &apos;Pat Garret and Billy the Kid (1973)&apos; by Sam Peckinpah; &apos;Gore Vidal&apos;s Billy the Kid&apos; with Val Kilmer ; &apos;Young Guns(1988)&apos; by Christopher Cain with Emilio Estevez ; and &apos;Young Guns 2(1990)&apos; by Geoff Murphy.\n\nThe picture was partially based on real events . The actual deeds are the followings : The most famous outlaw-gunslinger of the South-west , Billy the Kid was known by several names, but mostly as William Bonney . Believed have been born in New York City , Billy moved west with his family and eventually became a cowboy in Lincoln county, New Mexico, for cattleman J.H. Tunstall (in the movie similar role played by Ian Hunter) . In February 1878 Tunstall was killed by a cattle rival (played by Gene Lockhart) and this started the Lincoln County war, in which Billy played a leading part and was one of the group that shot dead Sheriff Brady . After his preceptor has been murdered he seeks vengeance for his death . He became an outlaw with a price on his head. Pat Garret(named in the film as Sherwood and played by Brian Donlevy), a former friend of the Kid, was elected sheriff of Lincoln County and set out to capture the young outlaw . He caught him and sentenced to be hanged. But Bill, although shackled hand and foot, managed to escape from jail by shooting dead the two deputies guarding him . Garrett went after him again and on 15 July 1881 tracked him at Fort Sumner, and there shot him dead by surprise in a darkened room.",

Let me put it very simply:\n\nThis. Is. Not. A. Narrative. Film.\n\nIf you&apos;re going to complain about lack of a plot, character development, or other features of narrative films, don&apos;t go see a non-narrative film! It&apos;s an entirely different experience, and that&apos;s the whole idea. Judging an experimental montage of images and music and voice by the standards of a conventional narrative film is ridiculous -- like complaining about a drama because it wasn&apos;t funny. It&apos;s not SUPPOSED to be. If you don&apos;t like films that don&apos;t have a conventional narrative, don&apos;t see them.\n\nSo, for those who DO actually like experimental, non-narrative film, I&apos;d highly recommend this one -- it&apos;s one of my all-time favourite films of any sort, even though  know the majority of the population probably couldn&apos;t sit through it. I found it incredibly powerful, evocative and visually stunning, and even 15 years after seeing it, some images from it are still burned into my mind. I&apos;m a big fan of Jarman&apos;s work in general, but if I had to pin down one single favourite from his work, I think this would be it."

Though this film may only be in Black and White, it definitely doesn&apos;t count against it now in modern days. The main basic purpose of the movie is timeless. This movie features great acting, beautiful song and dance numbers, and great design work and film shots. Follow the Fleet is also comical, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline. Its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade, how it can affect those today. If you want to see something great, check this out."

      "reviewBody": "Traffic (2000)\n\nLike an abstract expressionist master, Steven Soderbergh stands in the center of a canvas that stretches from Cincinnati to Tijuana. He mixes materials and splashes colors with the dash and power of a Jackson Pollock. His materials are skillful acting, lively editing, a dynamic music score, and an unflinching camera. (He did his own lensing, under a pseudonym). The artist&apos;s aim? To paint a picture of our country&apos;s drug problem.\n\nScripted by Stephen Gaghan, &quot;Traffic&quot; has its roots in a 1989 British television mini-series, &quot;Traffik,&quot; which followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. There are three loosely related stories, each with its own color coding--and as with Pollock, there is nothing random about where the paint splashes upon the canvas.\n\nBlue hues bathe blue bloods in Cincinnati where an Ohio Supreme Court Justice (Michael Douglas) is flattered into taking a job as national drug czar, just as his bright young daughter (Erika Christensen) is seduced into addiction by her prep-school friends.\n\nA rich golden-yellow surrounds San Diego where a comely couple (Catherine Zeta-Jones and Steven Bauer) occupy the upper links of the drug chain and spend ill-gotten cash on clothes, cars and country clubs. They are pursued by two undercover cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) who spend most of their screen time cooped up in a surveillance van.\n\nIn Mexico, a washed-out, burnished brown bespatters a desert of desperation as two Baja policemen (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) pull off a major drug bust only to be themselves busted, by a sinister general (Tomas Milian) who notifies them that &apos;I will take over from here.&apos; Each color signifies its own impenetrable culture, and when Douglas crosses into Mexico to meet his counterpart, we know (but he doesn&apos;t) that his fellow drug czar is really a drug lord.\n\nThe performances were exceptional, especially considering that no one was given star treatment. Much of the film was shot with existing light and Soderbergh kept the composition wide, letting the actors create their own space. Douglas was surprisingly believable as the would-be czar and bookends an Oscar-worthy year with his scruffy professor in the earlier &quot;Wonder Boys.&quot; His real-life wife, Zeta-Jones (carrying their child), gave a quite credible performance as a society snob who turns ruthless when her status is threatened.\n\nOther stand-outs include Christensen&apos;s drugged-out daughter, Del Toro&apos;s street smart Mexican cop and Cheadle&apos;s dedicated drug buster. In fact, there was not a weak performance in the bunch, including crucial cameos by veterans Peter Riegert and Albert Finney. Real people even play roles: Douglas&apos;s fictional drug czar confers with real-life senator Orrin Hatch, while actual customs officials relate their day-to-day drug enforcement dilemmas.\n\nEach of the three stories ends with a glimmer of hope. But despite small battles being won, the film&apos;s verdict is that the larger war is plainly being lost. As if on cue, White House Director of Drug Policy, Barry McCaffrey, has resigned effective January 6, 2001. The real-life outgoing czar, a former general, has become a vocal supporter of increased funding for treatment programs.\n\nLike Pollock, Soderbergh continues to stretch the boundaries of his art, as he did a dozen years ago with &quot;sex, lies, and videotape,&quot; and more recently with the undervalued &quot;The Limey.&quot; &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; though fairly conventional by his standards, nevertheless completes a year any director would envy.\n\nRating:  3 1/2 stars out of 4"

      "reviewBody": "I personally really like movies that portray childhood the way I remember it--kids doing kid-like activities and adventures, summers with free time to wander and explore, and seeing the way kids think. They don&apos;t quite see things as adults do. The kids in the movie were quite realistic.\n\nI think that Michele, the main character has more awareness and sympathy for people than most kids as evidenced by the stories he writes and reads to his sister. After he finds a child in a hole in the ground he writes a story about a child hidden away. Yet he reacts like a child in that he doesn&apos;t realize that there is something illegal going on, at least at first. The story unfolds slowly but steadily.\n\nBecause this movie is about kids and some suspicious people (Michele&apos;s father and friends)and the story is not written with a formula, there is an added dimension to the element of unpredictability.\n\nI truly was inspired by the cinematography showing the idyllic scenes of the summer and wheat fields of Italy, including the insects and wildlife. I really liked the scene with the three threshers approaching Michele as he was crossing the fields. This scene also made us aware of the passing of time and probably summer soon ending. Also, there is, as there in many neighborhoods, a grumpy scary person (the hog farmer) who adds to the atmosphere of unpredictability.\n\nThe music is absolutely wonderful. And it is not just the music, but also listen to the skill of the musicians. Just because it is a string quartet playing, don&apos;t think it&apos;s boring.\n\nIn summary, this is a suspenseful, beautiful movie.",

No subject was too grim for this cheerful director--remember the trio of killers dissolving their victim in an acid bath (Le trio infernal, 1974). The story of Marthe Hanau, another forgotten name from the Thirties, must have appealed to Girod and Romy Schneider. Resnais had made his Stavisky with the same material and had had some success.\n\nThis story moves at the speed of a retreating glacier. Many scenes go flat for lack of interest. It takes a Renoir to draw a portrait of a society in crisis, and Girod is no Renoir. I am a fan of Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jean-Claude Brialy, Marie-France Pisier and the other stars in the cast, but they are used only for window-dressing. Happily there is Romy Schneider, the most beautiful woman in the business in those days, and she does not disappoint. Her costumes are gorgeous, her hair never looked better, and she can swoop into a room better than any other actress. The way she spits out her defiance of the corrupt, conservative officials who oppose her kept me interested in the film.",

It&apos;s a straight revenge story with a great cast of supporting actors: the 4 Mexican killers sent by Gomez, the doctor (Pajarito), the funny hangman, the two beautiful ladies (Nieves Navarro and Gabriella Giorgelli)... everybody is just perfect for the part they play!

It must be very difficult to act with CGI, yet there are rarely, if ever, occasions when you see this cast looking even slightly lost.\n\nIt may be a parody, it may be silly, but it&apos;s apparent that a lot of care went into making this, and the cast look like they&apos;re having fun - which always creates a good impression. There is nothing remarkable here, or particularly scary, but it does what it&apos;s supposed to do - entertain the audience. One of those movies that seems to go by quickly, and during which you won&apos;t find your mind drifting off to another place. Not sure what to rent for the evening?

We just did&apos;nt fit in anywhere.. but we always had one another and hung out all the time. I was totally in love with him (still am to this very day, he will always be a part of my life and in my heart)... well, he just did&apos;nt have a clue that I cared about him in that way and all I ever heard was how much he &quot;loved&quot; one of the cheerleaders. She never gave him the time of day and he still had this &quot;thing&quot; for her... Our story was&apos;nt as happy though, he never found out how I felt for him.. I got married to someone else later on and so did he and we have since lost touch and I have been looking for him. Guess the first time I seen this movie, I liked it just because it was SUCH a good movie but a few years later seeing it, it really hit me in the face and to this day I always watch it whenever I get the chance and remember my friend...",

      "reviewBody": "I love the original 1958 film &apos;The blob.&apos; I&apos;ve somehow been unaware until very recently that 1972 sequel &apos;Beware! The blob&apos; existed. Frankly, ignorance was bliss, and I wish I had it back.\n\nThis movie borrows the sci-fi horror stylings of the 50s flick, yes. Some death scenes are duly unsettling, and at its best there&apos;s a measure of uneasy atmosphere and tension at times. However, it then also tries to one-up the worst indulgences of its predecessor&apos;s B-movie contemporaries with awful, unfunny ham-handedness that closely resembles mid-century TV shows like &apos;The Munsters,&apos; &apos;Batman,&apos; or &apos;The Partridge Family&apos; more than anything else. Couple this with astounding, blithe inauthenticity in the characters, dialogue, and scene writing - and not least in the acting. There&apos;s not one trace of sincerity in anyone&apos;s performances; if I didn&apos;t know any better I&apos;d say they were drunk or high every time the camera was rolling, or had never been in front of a camera before and couldn&apos;t suppress a nervous smile. If not for tasteless scenes of animals getting eaten by the blob, then I&apos;d be cheering for the ooze just in the hope that all the characters go away - and then the cast, crew, and filmmakers, in turn.\n\n&apos;Beware!&apos; wants to be an extra gauche and campy horror-comedy, but it also wants to offer earnest disquiet as the blob advances. Both strains fall apart owing to the confounding lack of care that anyone put into the project. I hate to fall back on &apos;Manos: The hands of fate&apos; as a point of comparison, but it&apos;s a worthwhile one here, because for all the faults of Harold P. Warren&apos;s no-budget infamy, at least in that instance everyone involved poured genuine effort into their contributions. This could have been fun, one way or another, but the picture we get is a mess where the appearance of the creature seems to be the only aspect consistently deserving of praise. Maybe I&apos;m just not properly attuned to this level of kitsch, yet the fact that this 1972 feature is strongest where it echoes its 1958 antecedent - and emphatically weakest when its own flavors are infused - says much. If only it could have found one steady tone; even the climax and ending, which seem so promising at first, can&apos;t completely avoid the wild, unwieldy oscillation.\n\nSure, I&apos;ve seen worse movies. So what? One could watch this in recognition of what it does irregularly do well - or my suggestion would be to just rewatch the 1958 movie, because that&apos;s why you&apos;re here in the first place. &apos;Beware! The blob&apos; is a sad instance of a sequel that we honestly just didn&apos;t need.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh, Brendan Fraser. How does one actor make so many movies that almost work but don&apos;t? He&apos;s been in a few brilliant films, a few god-awful ones, but the majority of them fall into an ever-widening pool of narrow misses.\n\n&quot;Inkheart&quot; is another one of those. It&apos;s frustratingly close. You want to go up to the screen and nudge it a bit so it crosses the line. It&apos;s a fantasy-- a genre where logic is only slightly required. If this story had made a wee bit more sense, it would&apos;ve hit the fantasy-acceptable mark. If the dialogue had more crackle and the characters had more contrast, it would&apos;ve worked. It looks beautiful. The effects are good. There are clever moments. It&apos;s well cast with actors known to be entertaining and who are spot-on for their parts. It could&apos;ve been a lovely, enjoyable family film if it had been given any amount of extra thought.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a man who finds out too late that when he reads aloud, it brings parts of the books he reads into the real world while it randomly sends real people into the book being read. When he reads the little-known children&apos;s book &quot;Inkheart&quot; to his wife, menacing charters fall out and his wife disappears. To have any chance of getting her back, he must have a copy of the rare book, so he packs up his young daughter and they spend years going from old bookstore to old bookstore rummaging through stacks of neglected volumes but not finding the one book he needs.\n\nFraser&apos;s bookbinder Mo is a likable good guy, the sort of character that&apos;s become Fraser&apos;s mainstay. Mo is a loving dad who&apos;s frightened by his unwanted ability and whose only quest is to read his wife home. It&apos;s a sweet, solid performance as Fraser plays straight man to some class-A scene-stealers. They are: \n\nHelen Mirren-- no explanation required. She doesn&apos;t work at upstaging anyone, it just happens. Here she&apos;s the wealthy aunt of Mo&apos;s missing wife. Despite her flamboyant style, she has hermitted herself away with the collection of books she treasures, preferring to read adventures, not live them.\n\nJim Broadbent-- no explanation required here, either. He has one of those faces. He has one of those voices. He plays &quot;Inkheart&apos;s&quot; author and it&apos;s entertaining to see how much glee he gets from meeting the characters he created, even the horrible ones.\n\nPaul Bettany-- He can&apos;t not be noticed. He&apos;s an actor who has an edgy energy about him--sort of like a younger Peter O&apos;Toole. Twice his supporting characters have diverted attention from Russell Crowe-- as the lively college roommate in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and as the ship&apos;s doctor and naturalist in &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.&quot; Except for looking at Heath Ledger, the only joy to be had in the mess that is &quot;A Knight&apos;s Tale&quot; is Bettany&apos;s Chaucer. He stole the movie, or at least as much of it as he wanted. In &quot;Inkheart&quot; his juggler Dustfinger is referred to as scary, but he&apos;s more scoundrel than villain as he attempts to right the wrong that&apos;s been done to him.\n\nRafi Gavron-- As a teen thief who is thankfully of no consequence to the plot of &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,&quot; he&apos;s adorable and adds a welcome lightness to his scenes. He&apos;s the future of scene stealing, earning some preliminary chops here among the pros.\n\nNeedless to say, when these actors are on screen together in any combination, you don&apos;t know where to look. It&apos;s mind-bending to try to understand how anyone could make a marginal movie with this cast.\n\nIn addition to the above, Eliza Bennett plays daughter Meggie. It&apos;s not a role that requires a lot, but she does a good job of not overplaying what could have been a whiny part. Poor Andy Serkis is stuck playing the same ego-maniacally evil villain we&apos;ve seen over and over. There&apos;s no imagination to his character or to his cliché band of goons. They&apos;re not even a particularly scary lot, and the lack of anyone or anything truly frightening contributes largely to making the story tepid.\n\n&quot;Inkheart&quot; has a fun, unofficial running game, a sort of &quot;Name that Tune&quot; where you try to recognize classic children&apos;s literature based on a character or a telltale prop. Watch it with your kids, and if they can&apos;t tell you what comes from where, move away from the TV and read them a book.",

He and his bald headed children are opposed by a Jesus Christ figure. Raymond Armstead (Lance Henriksen) is the rich owner of the Atlanta basketball franchise. He is part of a conspiracy trying to gain control of the little girl by marrying her mother Barbara and having another child with her. Katy gets a gun as a gift from Jerzy and carelessly shots her mother paralyzing her. They bring in housekeeper Jane Phillips (Shelley Winters). Det. Jake Durham (Glenn Ford) is investigating Katy and the shooting.\n\nThe opening has a Christ-like figure doing an exposition to a bunch of bald-headed kids about an intergalactic battle of good and evil. Then John Huston walks in. That&apos;s some crazy drugs these people are taking. I&apos;m tempted to claim this is a B-movie but the A-list cast belies its first rate intentions. The writing is a mess. Giulio Paradisi&apos;s directing is a mishmash of styles and ideas. I admire the spirit of abandon of this movie. It has a healthy dose of horror with a child and her superpowers like The Omen. The sci-fi motif is campy. This is weirdly fascinating despite it loopy story. It&apos;s definitely not a good movie but I kept watching anyways.",

      "name": "A sentimental film about things seemingly not",
      "reviewBody": "There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could&apos;ve taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both.\n\nA Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother&apos;s preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner&apos;s &quot;Butch&quot; Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch&apos;s loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem.\n\nWhen he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could&apos;ve imagined. Butch&apos;s dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn&apos;t care less about him. Phillip&apos;s dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I&apos;m blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine.\n\nIt&apos;s big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don&apos;t get the &quot;time to be a man&quot; talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you&apos;ve lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I&apos;ve trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood&apos;s Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn&apos;t as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It&apos;s actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart.\n\nPerformance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner&apos;s character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible.\n\nA Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner&apos;s most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It&apos;s undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but.\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.",

Since Eli is still with us and I think he is in good health, would&apos;nt it be great if he could do a commentary on the film,(or at least an intro, or small interview, like he did for The Good The Bad And The Ugly reissue), prehaps along with Anne as well, if they are both up for it. But anyway it is a real shame that this gem has never been released for home theater viewing. Columbia finally released Good Neighbor Sam, but you have to get it in a box set. Other 60s funny ones I&apos;m waiting for are; The Film Flam Man, The Art Of Love, Cold Turkey, and John Goldfarb Please Come Home.",

Sweat plays more than a role in the plot: characters are sweating all the time (mainly Harry Barber), for different reasons. May be that&apos;s why some people dislike it."

For those who want to study films, for those who pursue cinema relentlessly, and also for those who just watch movies because they just like to. If you&apos;re wondering why a silent film, the movie not only answers it, but makes you fall in love with the medium. it&apos;s clearly a product of a thinking director, where every thing in the scene has a story to tell. Whether it&apos;s the ironical film posters, street signs, or just a little dog barking quietly in the corner. \n\nI don&apos;t need to comment on the talents. The Best Actor award at Cannes 2011 has done that already. I will however mention the four-legged supporting actor in the movie. Best performance I&apos;ve ever seen so far! \n\nEnjoy this movie.

      "reviewBody": "An unusual work in Wolfgang Petersen&apos;s filmography, &quot;Die Konsequenz&quot; (&quot;The Consequence&quot;) is a heartbreaking and unconventional love story, a movie that makes us look at Petersen in a different way, far from the optic we used to know from the director of blockbusters such as &quot;Air Force One&quot; and &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;. Without the speed and the colors of his notorious films, he has plenty of time to develop his story and create a brilliant piece that echoes life, giving his most natural and realistic work along with &quot;Das Boot&quot;. His posterior enterprises might have stronger energies, action and bigger castings but doesn&apos;t have the patience and beautiful elements this has.\n\nA saddening tale on the recklessness of youth in its pursuit for love, &quot;The Consequence&quot; deals on the obstacles two lovers have to face while trying to be together. Not the ordinary love story, quite the opposite. This one involves Martin (Jürgen Prochnow, in his best performance) an actor imprisoned for seducing a minor, and the young Thomas Manzoni (Ernst Hannawald), son of the prison&apos;s warden. Both were approached due to a play performed in the jail - unimaginable setting for such encounter to happen but believable in certain contexts. They share some good moments, always in secrecy, but the challenge comes after Martin&apos;s release. They meet again, already sure that what they shared was love and they&apos;re ready to live with each other, but Thomas parents are against their relation and even more opponent to their son&apos;s homosexuality, and these new facts causes the role changes in the story: this time the younger one will be arrested - in a juvenile facility though, after some arrangements made by his father - while the other will try anything to be near his lover or to release him if possible.\n\nNot the cup of tea of many viewers out there who can&apos;t handle sad stories but the moral and warnings we get from this tale are truly valuable, very honest to us. It&apos;s cruel but it has a point. More than just a love story, it&apos;s a painful piece on the consequences of immaturity, right in that drastic point between youth and adulthood, already showing that choices have ultimate and heavy consequences that&apos;ll affect everyone&apos;s lives in one way or another. Thomas apparent brave act of showing to his family that he loves Martin and he wants to live with him only proves to be disastrous to himself. Their union faces bumps after bumps, and a great part of those happen because of the younger guy, not smart or not experienced to know the ways of life. If only he kept this a secret, just run away with his partner, things would might turn out to be OK for him and Martin.\n\nEnthusiastic admirers of great acting will be delighted with the magnificent performances of the main stars. Prochnow, usually best suited in villain roles, is amazing in this sort of heroic role, not a perfect guy but a committed, passionate and kind, completely caught off guard and head over heels for this boy and always making his best to help him, even when he realizes that it&apos;s no longer possible. He express plenty with just few words. Hannawald&apos;s angelical face little by little becoming the face of sadness and misery is certainly the most unforgettable in the movie along with some of his lines (&quot;I think it&apos;s really rotten of them to lock you up like this for making love to a boy&quot;) innocently referring on Martin&apos;s condemnation. He gives the performance of a lifetime in here.\n\nTimes are different, there&apos;s more openness and acceptance when it comes to sexuality issues but things aren&apos;t so bright and positive, which makes this film even more relevant today than like it was in the 1970&apos;s. Desperately needs more audience. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "In &quot;It&apos;s A Gift&quot;, W.C. Fields delivers enjoyable silliness as only he could do it.  It&apos;s quite a showcase for his brand of humor, and this movie has it all, from sight gags to dry wit to hilarious predicaments to a put-upon hero.  There have been few comedians like Fields who could get so much mileage out of simple ideas, or who could make outrageous ideas work so well.\n\nThe plot ostensibly concerns store owner Harold Bissonette (Fields), who dreams of owning an orange ranch in California, but very little actually happens in terms of a story - the emphasis is on the trials of daily life that Harold must endure.  The movie is a series of comic set pieces in which Fields takes a simple situation and turns it into a stream of gags and laughs.  His ability to find endless sources of humor in the most mundane of settings is an impressive contrast with the labored and often inappropriate efforts of so many of today&apos;s comic actors.\n\nIn this one, Fields also manages to create a pleasant atmosphere that, despite all the disorder in Harold&apos;s life, makes you feel at home with the characters.  Many of the scenes also give one of the other cast members a chance for some good moments, and Kathleen Howard helps out a lot, too, as Harold&apos;s nagging wife.  There&apos;s nothing to take seriously here, but if you&apos;re in the mood not to take anything seriously, this is a very enjoyable way to spend an hour or so."

A lot of people die. Klaus Kinski plays a drug addict who sells information to the highest bidder. Usually gets paid off with small envelopes of powder. He finally gets killed.

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film in 1972 when it came out, and I just saw it again on cable. I am amazed at how prescient this film was. Remember, this was before Jerry Brown, the real life politician most people will think of as a counterpart to Redford&apos;s character, had not yet run for governor and was still unknown outside of California. Nixon was still in office and was about to be re-elected by a landslide. Abortion was still illegal in all 50 states, and Roe v. Wade had not yet been decided. The term &quot;sound bite&quot; had not yet been coined. &quot;Spin&quot; was something a washing machine did.\n\nRedford plays an idealistic young storefront lawyer who is persuaded to run for the Senate as a Democrat against a Republican incumbent running for his fourth term. He feels free to speak his mind because he knows he hasn&apos;t a chance of winning. His freshness and honesty win over a lot of people favorable to his politics, and suddenly the gap closes. Now he has a chance of winning, but to do so he has to win over the &quot;undecided voters&quot; in the middle of the political spectrum. (Sound familiar? I&apos;m writing this nine days before the Bush-Kerry election, and no one knows who will win.) Guess what happens? Suddenly he&apos;s not so fresh and honest anymore. And by the time he finally has a televised debate with the incumbent, he has mastered the art of the non-answer answer, that is, responding to a reporter&apos;s question by making a vague statement of his own without ever answering the question.\n\nFast forward to 2004. The spin doctors now run the show. This film was intended as satire and as a warning. Regrettably, it has become a prediction. 10/10",

For somebody who was (they reshowed it once on early TV, on one of those shows that had a local Uncle Bob type playing old westerns and cartoons, and promoting the station&apos;s shows in between. Even now, when I think of the juxtaposition of the aboveground world of the singing cowboy, the &quot;Thunder Riders&quot; and their bizarre, futuristic city under the mountain, I get goosebumps. The best occasion I had to see this was one summer, when I went to the local Y every Saturday morning to see a bunch of old movies with 3-400 other kids my age; the title would roll up, and the kids would scream. \n\nAlso, I think I could prove that Freud was right about infantile sexuality when I think of the way I felt about the underground queen, clad in silvery, clinging clothes.",

Princ a Vecernice..actually made 1979 was especially scored with beautiful music from the great, outstanding, master - tastefully Czech composer Svatopluk Havelka. Special the string charts on his film music score are truly jazz influented in harmony style, sound and orchestration. The sound remind me to actual productions found on popular scores from Argentine composer - arranger Jorge Calandrelli. The film had beautiful costume outfits and living most from good -humorfully dialogs and acting and even not overwhelming - bigger than live special effects.

      "reviewBody": "Starring the incomparable Ellen Burstyn, giving an Oscar-winning performance (one of the finest of the 1970s), this comedy-drama is gritty and tough, but never off-putting. After her husband dies, 35-year-old Alice Hyatt from New Mexico and her smart-mouthed 11-year-old son (Alfred Lutter) take to the road, chasing her girlhood dream of finding songbird success in Monterey, CA. They get stuck in Phoenix, where she meets up with a frightening working-stiff in a cowboy hat (Harvey Keitel). Later, waitressing at Mel &amp; Ruby&apos;s Cafe in Tucson, she meets a gentle farmer (Kris Kristofferson) who&apos;s had his share of heartbreak. Perceptive, amusing, knockabout film regarding ordinary people trying to make it, episodes in their lives that enrich or derail them. Alice and her son have a wonderfully natural give-and-take, and the oddballs they meet on their odyssey (like Jodie Foster&apos;s shoplifting tomboy or the sweet, overweight cowboy who gives Alice a singing job) are deliciously silly, yet incredibly real. Burstyn is a joy cutting up with her neighbor in the backyard, having a Coke fight with her kid in a seedy motel, trading quips with Diane Ladd&apos;s salty Flo in the diner. Some critics complained that the happy ending felt tacked on, but you come to respect Alice and her choices, and most of the film&apos;s little faults are camouflaged by director Martin Scorsese&apos;s bittersweet framing and Robert Getchell&apos;s vivid screenplay. Far superior to the TV sitcom, &quot;Alice&quot;, which quickly followed.",

I first saw this film on the IMDb Top 50 Sci-fi poll, and decided to give it a try. I was able to locate it online, and within a few days it had finished downloading. Until they release this on DVD with English subtitles, downloading the movie is really you&apos;re only option (unless you are Russian). It shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find, however, just be patient.\n\nAnyway, this film is a complete joy! All of the characterizations are perfect, and the film&apos;s gritty futuristic feeling is a mix of Star Wars, Blade Runner and Rosencrantz and Guidenstern Are Dead. I can&apos;t recommend this film enough! It&apos;s a smart, funny and brilliant piece of cinema that I hope finds its niche before its too late.",

      "reviewBody": "I was excited to see this brilliant ensemble cast do their magic in Go Go Tales, but I found myself unexpectedly being served a gourmet hot-dog from actors who are capable of playing much more challenging characters. What makes a gourmet hot-dog anyways? Is it made from the lips and a**holes of kobe beef? Is there fois gras blended in with the questionable parts of top-shelf carcasses? I don&apos;t think it is an accident that right in the middle of Go Go Tales there is a scene with gourmet hot dogs being cooked the gourmet way - in microwave ovens, while the beautiful go-go dancers cook themselves in a faulty tanning bed.\n\nThis isn&apos;t to say that Go Go Tales was badly acted - it was very well acted for what it is - a meandering vignette of a failing second rate strip joint; a metaphor for how even the most exotic dreams and aspirations are subject to blandness like anything else. It plays out like a cabaret stage production, a bit of aimless vaudeville salted with an undercurrent of subtle existential humming: A page out of Cassavetes&apos; Killing of a Chinese Bookie. Like &apos;Chinese Bookie&apos;, this film offered more pleasure for me in the thinking about it afterward than it was to watch.\n\nI can&apos;t say that I didn&apos;t like it, and I can&apos;t say that I want to watch it again. But for a gourmet hot-dog, it wasn&apos;t terrible; it was mostly just a regular hot-dog made with some Hoskins, Dafoe and a dash of Modine, thrown in a microwave and served in the bawdy atmosphere of a musky strip club.",

If you are a Christopher Lee fan and enjoy some of his early works, this is the film you will be interested in, as well as, the fact that Donald Sutherland, (Sgt. Paul/The Witch/Old Man) &quot;Ask The Dusk&quot;, gives an outstanding role in this picture as many characters. This story is about a Count Drago, (Christopher Lee), &quot;Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, who preserves many animals and keeps them in their natural appearance. You would probably say it was taxidermy, but this is another form of transformation that works and in an entirely different way. The Count invites a carnival group to entertain him at his mysterious castle where the carnival act shows a man being hanged and brought back to life. Gaia Germani, (Laura) gives a great supporting role as the attractive female who is adored by Count Drago and some other weird and sick looking people. This is a rather early film for Christopher Lee and Donald Sutherland and you can see from their performance they were going to be great stars on the Silver Screen. Great Classic Horror Film.",

      "reviewBody": "Basil Rathbone&apos;s third appearance as Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s eccentric sleuth and the first in Universal&apos;s series of 12 films in which the master detective is transplanted from Victorian England to the modern era in which the films were made. &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror&quot; was not that unusual in that, until 20th Century Fox produced &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; in 1939, most previous Holmes films had also placed our hero in contemporary society. It was not until this film, however, that the contemporary aspects were given such strong emphasis. \n\nThere&apos;s no Moriarty on hand this time, as Holmes and Watson (played, of course, by Nigel Bruce) join Britain in battling the Nazis. It&apos;s all a little awkward, but there is some fine atmosphere, especially in a scene in which Holmes and Watson visit a seedy pub in search of information. The cast is good, with Thomas Gomez as a very effective villain, Evelyn Ankers as the proverbial bad girl with a heart of gold, and, as a diplomat, the wickedly suave Henry Daniell who would return to play Professor Moriarty in &quot;The Woman in Green.&quot; Best of all is Rathbone, who is razor sharp despite a very peculiar hairstyle that looks like it belongs in a gladiator flick. \n\nThe series improved considerably once Roy William Neill took over as director with the second film, and later entries that did not emphasize the &quot;modern&quot; concept, like &quot;Spider Woman&quot; and, most particularly, &quot;The Scarlet Claw,&quot; are far superior, but &quot;Voice of Terror&quot; is still an entertaining show, perfect viewing on a rainy, fog shrouded night.",

I do wish Estella Warren had more to do in this film, because she is just LUSH! and one of my favourite models.  But it seems as though she has just been put in the film for the eye-candy, which is great but she needs to do more because she deserves a better chance to really make it as an actress. But overall it is quite entertaining with the racing scenes and the variety of locations they go to. Maybe it would&apos;ve been better if it took itself less seriously. A masterpiece it aint, but better than i expected and easy to watch. I say to all the people who are trashing this film, you are entitled to your opinion and so am i. My opinion is that you are a bunch of SNOBS!! Admit it, you are!\n\nRating- 8 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t tell you how many times I&apos;ve seen this movie; a rough estimate would be at least half a dozen times, just through three or four years. And amazingly enough, I laugh every single time. It may be that Michael Palin is just so damn funny and typically Monty Python-like in the film, it may be that Jamie Lee Curtis has a surprising amount of comedic talent, it may be that Kevin Kline is excellent in both of his roles in the film... heck, it may even be John Cleese&apos;s entertaining performance... and I&apos;m not even a fan of him. The film manages to be incredibly funny despite being very tacky and downright tasteless in many, many scenes. The plot is pretty good, and, as far as I know, quite original. It deals with a multi-billionaire and a zoo, which (obviously) doesn&apos;t make a lot of money, like the billionaire wants it to. The film has a good pace and is rarely - if ever - boring. The acting is very good, but one wouldn&apos;t expect any less from such names as John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. It was also a nice surprise to recognize Richard Ridings, who plays one of my favorite characters in the Luc Besson film, Jeanne D&apos;arc: La Hire. I recognized him almost instantly by his very distinguished laugh. The characters are well-written, well-cast and well-acted, as well as credible. I thoroughly enjoyed most of them, even though they are mostly caricatures. That just added to the humor of the film, I think. As in several other of Kevin Kline&apos;s films, he plays two parts, and he, as always(well, nearly always, anyway) does so very well. I understand that this is, in some ways, apparently a sequel to the late-80&apos;s comedy A Fish Called Wanda; now, I haven&apos;t seen that film, so I can&apos;t really comment on how the two relate to each other, but if &quot;Wanda&quot; is in any way as funny as this movie, I&apos;m gonna have to see it sometime. The humor is excellent; black, crude humor at its best. All in all, a very good comedy if you don&apos;t mind some tacky humor. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors, fans of tacky/crude/black humor and even fans of Monty Python, since both members involved in this are great. 7/10",

When Bellaccini is killed in a mill accident, the entire town turns against Pastore and Miss Pola.\n\nIt&apos;s a straightforward movie from a novel by Luigi Pirandello, but director Walter Ruttman fills it out with scenes from the mill, of white-hot steel in blocks and ribbons, so much so that between these images and the title, you see steel wherever it appears: railroad bridges and gates. Ruttman had begun directing ten years earlier, shorts that played with geometric forms. He is probably best remembered as a writer for Fritz Lang&apos;s METROPOLIS. He would continue to direct, mostly short subjects, until just before his death in 1941 at age 56. Pirandello would win the Nobel Prize for his body of writings in 1934 and die in 1936, aged 69."

Berlinger escapes from Germany by plane and emigrates to South-America resp. Sweden where he becomes a rich man. In the 70s he returns to Germany just when a former friend of his is buying up real estate for a huge leisure park project. Since Berlinger doesn&apos;t want to sell the premises of his old factory, a conflict ensues between the powers of the capital on the one hand and a single man (who gets a little help from some workers and a teacher he falls in love with) on the other hand.\n\nThis films appears to be from a completely different time now although it is only 25 years old - which is not to say that it isn&apos;t fresh and very entertaining. First, it&apos;s a POLITICAL film which explains the inner workings of capitalism and the difference a single nonconformistic person can still make in a highly bourgeois society in an exemplary way. Berlinger is a true individualist (almost anarchist) and a very virile and likeable hero (which is quite rare in German cinema). Secondly, when you watch the film now it&apos;s almost like a time travel back to the last days of the machine-age. And these machines (an old engine and a zeppelin that Berlinger is working on) are so much more fascinating, sensual and beautiful than the boring computers of the information-age we are living in now. Flying was an ancient dream of mankind, surfing in the Internet was not!\n\nWhen asked for the best directors of the New German Film in the 70s I&apos;ll add Sinkel/Brustellin from now on to the likes of Herzog, Fassbinder, Wenders, Schlöndorff and Klick.",

An award winning film hailed by the critics and an exemplar for American Indie makers,  &quot;Solas&quot; will appeal most to more mature audiences into Europix.

      "name": "Some food for thought but Maher undermines himself by being silly, picking easy targets and not being as intelligent in his approach as he is capable of",
      "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to this film because the one thing I hate on Real Time is when Bill Maher goes off on one about religion, making massive sweeping statements about people not being allowed to vote if they believe in angels etc. It is not that I disagree with the basic argument he says but just that he doesn&apos;t seem to have a lot to back it up and, the odd time he is called on it by the guests he will move along and not really seem to have much behind his general opinion that people with religious beliefs are idiots. So for me this film was not an opportunity to get more annoyed by this but rather give him my undivided attention and let him lay out his case.\n\nHe manages to do this here and there but nowhere near consistent or good enough to make an argument capable of changing minds  although perhaps good enough to provide food for thought. At the end of the film he gives a very good speech that sums up his film and this is probably the strongest part of the whole film as it challenges and makes reasonable points. OK it is loaded with imagery that backs up his points in a very blunt way but I can forgive him for this. What I have a problem with is that the rest of the film doesn&apos;t have this same core of logic and reasoned argument. He hits it here and there but too often he is doing two things. The first of these two things is that he will never give up an easy joke and this is not helped that his goal often seems to be that he seems very keen to mock people rather than reason with them. Hence we get the personal barbed remarks that are thrown out for the audience but the interviewees either don&apos;t hear or don&apos;t get their response shown. The second thing he does is select really weak people if his goal is anything other than mockery. I do agree with a lot of what Bill says  particularly about the role of religion in world politics. I do believe in the concept that religious tenants within people&apos;s personal lives as guides and moral foundation is something I can live with but when things are taken as fact and taken totally literally then things get out of hand. So I do want to see Bill present a more rounded argument and have that debate with people who can talk to him at the same sort of intellectual level.\n\nSadly what we get are interviews with a priest who is a self-appointed doctor, a man who plays Jesus at the Holy Land theme park, a Muslim extremist British rapper (who let me say has ZERO profile over here), a man who is a reformed homosexual, a man who claims to be descended directly from Jesus and thus now leads the one true church and others of similar quality. We do have experts on the roster but they are mainly used to back up what Maher is saying. Now, I know many people do not like him, but to me Maher is too smart to need to be protected from reasonable discussion. The only exception I would give is the one priest he talks to who seems very liberal and open to taking the basics of his religion and getting away from dogma and ritual. Outside of him though Maher does not have a hard time showing them up but, when he occasionally gets someone who is a bit more careful with language and phrasing and can prevent themselves sounding like nuts, the film uses an even more cowardly trick. What we get are Maher filmed in the car talking about the interview, which very much gives him the final word and allows him to make responses and ridicule once the individual is not there to respond anymore. I do like Maher enough to watch his stuff, but this is a cheap trick and cheapens the film by extension. Of course this doesn&apos;t look as bad when you consider the heavy editing in of footage from other films  some of it is fine to provide images, stimuli or just as a base but again mostly this is used to mock the subjects after the fact, the most unnecessary and annoying example being the use of Scarface  the guy was doing fine making himself look crazy, it didn&apos;t need the heavy hand.\n\nI read a comment on this website that said if you disagree with Maher then the film is not for you, it is about you  sadly I have to agree with that. This film will do best with those who are coming to watch Maher put the boot in without a lot of finesse or intelligence  just like he often does on Real Time. There are plenty of moments where he makes very good points and allows his subjects to talk themselves into a corner but too often he is selecting weak targets (people at a theme park!), mocking them with easy gags, letting them make themselves look like idiots (which many are) and then standing back as if he has proved something beyond the point that this person, right here, is an idiot, which he has not. It is a real shame because this should be a film for everyone  even if not everyone likes it. If he is serious about his plea for moderates to look in the mirror then he needs to make a film that does that and, sadly, this isn&apos;t it. It provides food for thought and I did find it a rousing challenge to religion but it is nowhere near the film that he should have made."

Don&apos;t listen to the negative reviews from people who can&apos;t enjoy a movie unless it&apos;s filled with nothing but car chases, explosions, and gun fights. This is a real down to earth story of two brothers wanting more for themselves who get caught up in bad things and everything spirals out of control. Kept my interest all the way through! Everyone in the cast was terrific and if you&apos;re a fan of Woody then you&apos;ll definitely enjoy this movie. Set in London like Match Point and has a similar tone although very different. Woody Allen at this best!!!"

His brother Julian Markham (Vincent Price) brings him back to the Markham Manor in England and keeps him prisoner in the attic. The mad Edward asks his lawyer Trench (Peter Arne) and his partner to bring the African sorcerer N&apos;Galo (Harry Baird) in secret to heal him but Julian does not allow any contact with his brother. Trench and N&apos;Galo simulate the death of Edward to remove him from the attic in a coffin. However, body snatchers bring his body to the unscrupulous Dr. Newhartt (Christopher Lee) for his research. Edward offers a large amount to Dr. Newhartt to stay hidden in his house and wears a crimson hood to hide his face. When Edward goes to the town, his mask brings problem to him and he begins a series of murders. When he finally meets N&apos;Galo, he finds why the natives have deformed him and he seeks revenge.\n\n&quot;The Oblong Box&quot; is a dark horror movie based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe. The screenplay keeps the story interesting until the end and the cast has two icons of the genre - Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. The sets and the atmosphere are stylish and adequate for the story. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

After her arrival in London, Myrna&apos;s sister Danny from Australia is called by the mysterious photographer David Armstrong who is later shot by a mysterious sniper as well...\n\nThis is one of my favourite Egar Wallace films. The plot is only set in London, there are many great buildings to see, which is not day-to-day for the German Edgar Wallace films. It is also a pleasure that Sir John is featured once again! The music is also very impressive. Composer Peter Thomas composed a thrilling harp-theme, accompanied by a brass section, the harp can be heard in the whole film over and over again. The theme entirely fits to the atmosphere of the town London as a capital. As a town in one of its busy days. Let&apos;s say: only with some murders. It is a very beautiful harp theme. Well, sometimes the plot could have been quicker.\n\nInspector Craig (Hansjörg Felmy) walks as if he would just need some money for a new radiator.\n\nThis quote above was once published by the film reviewer and Edgar Wallace film expert Joachim Kramp, who also wrote some books about the Edgar Wallace films. I think this could be right, but I wouldn&apos;t prefer an Edgar Wallace film that is too quick. That wouldn&apos;t be suitable. Crime thrillers needn&apos;t always to be hard or brutal, the plot in general is important.\n\nI can just recommend that film!"

Part homage to German expressionism, part allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920&apos;s. Moreover, the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning. Aside from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice, perception, and opinion. In truth, it&apos;s not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows. In sum, this film is something not often seen and, as the producer of the film said in the Q&amp;A that followed, will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day."

This time a dysfunctional family led by Dad (Stephen Furst), goes to the wilderness to bond.  His kids and their hilariously funny friend have other things in mind.  The action scenes in the film are matched by the comedic touches the actors bring to their roles.  The high paced action and comedy is tempered with real Native American concerns and this ads a touch of humanity to the film.   One of the best things in the film is the Cast and Directing.  They manage to breath life into an average script.  This film is definitely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this movie only twice. Once when it first hit commercial television, and again about 15 years ago, and it is unforgettable. It&apos;s great to see I&apos;m not alone in my appreciation. I think it&apos;s a classic . . . . a &quot;must see&quot; for anyone who considers themselves a cinefile.\n\nThe two leads, Tushingham and Reed, are at the height of their powers and both give brilliant performances. (no hyperbole) The story is well conceived, well developed and executed to perfection. It holds together. The movie is a little gem. \n\nConsidering when it was made, the budget it was made under, and the politics of the time, (you couldn&apos;t find &quot;real&quot; Native American&apos;s in the actors union), it is an extraordinary work.\n\nTo criticize this movie for using an Italian &quot;Indian&quot; is like dismissing &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; because of a half-dozen glaring continuity errors. It means you&apos;ve missed the point. Close your mind and open your heart. You will be rewarded for watching it, if in no other way than to witness, deeply and completely, the archetypes of what the masculine and feminine essences are in the universe. \n\nTushingham (Eve) IS the frightened rabbit that Reed (Jean) says she is. She has been torn from civilization to witness all manner of horrors of life in the wilderness. And what can be said of Reeds LaBete? Even those who laud this actors genius underestimate him.\n\nWhile we&apos;re on the subject, how is it possible that during the Acadamy Awards Ceremony, when Reed&apos;s last movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; won BEST PICTURE, that he was overlooked when they did their eulogizing segment on those important figures who had passed away during the previous year? Conspicuous and tragic was his omission from that roster.\n\nDo yourself a favor. See &quot;The Trap&quot;. And then . . . . see it again.\n\n8",

Unfortunate, but that alone keeps viewers away from films they&apos;d enjoy if they took the time to give it a chance. Anyway, this is VERY far removed from typical Hollywood movies that work in the same genre and aim films at the same age groups. If &quot;Michael Bay-standard Hollywood blow em ups&quot; is your thing, this you&apos;ll despise. Trust me. If you despise &quot;Michael Bay-standard Hollywood blow em ups&quot; you&apos;ll certainly not leave this movie feeling as though your time has been wasted. Enjoy if you should choose to do so.",

      "reviewBody": "In Cafe con leche, a documentary about legendary cuban filmmaker Nicolás Guillén Landrián, director Manuel Zayas brilliantly uses the very same narrative and structural techniques pioneered by Landrián, to provide a portrait of the late director. Highly censored during his lifetime (only 3 of his 18 documentaries ever screened), Landrián, or Nicolasito as he is affectionately known, belonged to a movement of cuban documentary filmmakers during the 60&apos;s-70&apos;s (which also included such greats as Santiago Alvarez), who were concerned with pushing technical as well as artistic limits of our understanding of what a documentary is, and combining it with powerful images and messages.\n\nThese highly controversial films broke with the tradition of observational documentary film, as well as the then popular cinema verité of the French or direct cinema from the UK. Landrián and his colleagues were artists whose films were more personally expressive, much like the recent work of Bruce Weber. Landrián also implored such techniques as multi-layered sound design (up to 26 tracks, unheard of for documentaries), as well as staccato-like jump cuts and reverse and slow-motion action that puts the best efforts on MTV to shame. Keep in mind these films were being made in the 1960&apos;s.\n\nManuel Zayas respects Landrián&apos;s aesthetic, adopting it as his own, as he recounts Landrián&apos;s life. Using much of Landrián&apos;s unseen film footage in Cafe con leche, Zayas pays homage to the legend, who was a revolutionary thinker and one of the many censored geniuses who history has forgotten.",

Firstly the script is a complete no-brainer with no compassion towards people&apos;s sensibilities.The Acting is overboard and amateurish with Ram leading the pack. He tries to do everything and does nothing even remotely OK. If you try to find potholes in the script let me assure you the holes are as big as the moon&apos;s craters. The pre-climax sequence,the utterly misplaced song and the climax will surely keep you engaged, i.e. you&apos;ll laugh your lungs out at the level of absurdity dished out to the audience.Don&apos;t be surprised if your five year kid starts to question the logic behind certain scenes. The most shocking news is that this senseless movie ran for 175 days in 17 theaters, pity those watched this movie in cinema hall. Please do not download the torrent and thank me for saving for precious time.",

      "reviewBody": "Annie Rooney lives with her officer father and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other neighborhood kids. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is head of the gang that Annie constantly battles), who is in a gang that is headed for trouble, says Officer Rooney. Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony plans to shoot Kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl, but Officer Kelly gets fatally wounded instead. Tim (part of Kelly&apos;s gang) is told by Tony, and friend Spider, that Kelly shot his father, so he goes after him in vengeance. Annie learns of this and goes to stop her brother, if she is in time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this film, even though the plot doesn&apos;t start until the 40 minute mark of the film. Pickford is enjoyable (even though she was 33 playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. Haines doesn&apos;t play Kelly as tough as he should, but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level. The scenes where the officer tells Annie of her father&apos;s death and the ending really put a lump in your throat. The mix of all sorts of kids throughout the film are fun to watch. Rating, 8.",

Rachel has just climbed into a taxi, but the window is down. Charles finally works up the nerve to try to kiss her through the window. Just as his lips are about to meet hers, the cab pulls away. The look on his face is pitiful but then you see her beautiful smile. A magical scene if ever there was one!\n\nOh yeah, Ione Skye DOES take her clothes off repeatedly in this movie, so guys who don&apos;t go for this sort of thing might give it a chance and be pleasantly surprised. I was."

Hey positive thinking and belief are incredibly important, if they stopped there it would be fine. I&apos;m all for a near-spiritual support for positive thinking. But don&apos;t believe you command the world! Believe what you like, and respect the beliefs of others. But here they make the case that your (subjective) beliefs drive the (objective) realities of the universe. They present it as though its a scientific fact. And they imply that this is the true secret of the ages, that all the greats possessed this precious knowledge, and that an evil conspiracy subdues it. That is patently false. It is truly a demented, grade school pseudoscience wrapped in an infomercial. At least Jerry Springer doesn&apos;t pretend his show is Cosmos!"

The great value of this film is pure nostalgia, those who have no relation to the children&apos;s book will probably not find so much of value in the film. As far as I know, this film is only available with Swedish language.\n\nThe settings are good, unlike other films in this series the settings are not props in a studio, but real outdoor filming. The film follows the book extremely close.\n\nThe only minus is that there is no dialogue, only a narrator. But that&apos;s a small minus, this is a good film for smaller children (and of course adults who remember their Elsa Beskow!).\n\nMy children (2 and 4 years of age) want to see this film over and over again, so now I know every single word in the film by heart! :^)",

      "reviewBody": "CARANCHO (&apos;Vulture&apos; or &apos;a bird of prey; an animal that attack and feed on wounded animals&apos;) is a disturbing film from the opening sequences until the end. Before any story begins we are given the information (superimposed over black and white photographs for broken glass and bodies on a street) about the number of automobile accidents and deaths (in excess of 8,000) each year, the leading cause of deaths in Argentina. This grim fact has produced an even more grim industry - ambulance chasing lawyers who follow and even at times stage accidents in order to collect from insurance and scam the real victims and the insurances companies too. This industry requires the participation of doctors, paramedical personnel and police on the take. Every aspect of this horrendous situation is played out in this tersely written (Alejandro Fadel, Martín Mauregui, Santiago Mitre, and Pablo Trapero who also directs). It is a tough film to watch but does serve to alert the audience to a major crime industry that though set in Buenos Aires, Argentina is prevalent probably throughout the world. \n\nSosa (Ricardo Darín) is a lawyer who has lost his license form some unstated reason who is now working for a &apos;foundation&apos; that falls into the category discussed above. He not only chases ambulances but also pays men to stage them so that he can collect money based on the fact that he works with the distraught families to win power of attorney for the injured or deceased, giving him access to the insurance money. His bosses are competitive and Sosa is repeatedly attacked physically a la mob style for his failure to perform. Sosa meets Luján (Martina Gusman), a beautiful young doctor who is at the beginning of her career and must work emergency rooms and ride in ambulances to administer to the injured or ill in order to gain experience to become a respected physician. They meet over an accident - Luján is giving aid to a victim and Sosa is planning to use the victim in his crime racket. Both Sosa and Luján seem to have occult senses of responsibility and ethics but life has brought them to a place where they must submerge their standards in order to survive: Luján happens to be a drug addicted &apos;to sustain the brutality of her work&apos; and Sosa endangers the lives of innocent people to satisfy the bosses to whom he must bow in order to survive. It is this contrast between their passion for each other and their participation in the dark crime of &apos;caranchos&apos; that provides the push/pull of their relationship, resulting in an ending few will predict. \n\nBoth Darín and Gusman are outstanding in very difficult roles, but the supporting cast - Carlos Weber, José Luis Arias, Fabio Ronzano, Loren Acuña, Gabriel Almirón, and José Manuel Espeche - is equally strong in smaller roles. This is a very dark film - in story, in locale (the San Justo region of Buenos Aires), and in the fact that it all takes place at night - but it carries information we all need to note and molds that information into a suspenseful thriller that is so well paced by director Pablo Tapero that every moment is filled with meaning. \n\nGrady Harp",

Documentarian Errol Morris indirectly argues that, at the very least, this evidence should have presented a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; to the jury, and near the end of the movie, the audience has little choice but to accept his unbelievable findings.  And the film ends with a single scene of just a tape recorder and voices that should be recognized as one of the most powerful endings to a movie, ever.  A documentary masterpiece.",

Really everything that happened in this movie belonged.\n\nIt&apos;s so corny and uplifting with its quirks and turns that it keeps you glued to your seat waiting for the next surprise. Excellent script, totally incredible acting, I am not sure why I didn&apos;t rate it a 10 except that it&apos;s not family fare (but is certainly good for a sit-down evening with the girlfriend!).",

      "reviewBody": "Another one of my favourite VHS rentals as a kid was Terror in the Aisles. Essentially a compilation of clips from horror movies, this is That&apos;s Entertainment for weirdos. And it works beautifully.\n\nA major reason why this works is the sheer breadth of the films that are used from the old to the new, the well known to the obscure. There are also films used that aren&apos;t strictly horror movies but are still examples of how suspense can be brilliantly generated in a film (Midnight Express, Night Hawks).\n\nThis film was also extremely popular in the UK as it contained clips from movies that were either banned by the BBFC (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre) or discreetly removed from video shelves by them (The Exorcist).\n\nAnother masterstroke by the movie are the links that involve horror royalty Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen in a cinema pontificating on horror tropes and what makes them work. These sequences are priceless. Look out for a young Angel Salazar as a &apos;feature moviegoer&apos;.\n\nThemes such as the villain and the victim/Final Girl are examined with the respective appropriate clips being used to illustrate the filmmakers points. Theres also a lesson in suspense by the master himself, Mr Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThis is a great compilation for either the young horror hound looking for new thrills or the seasoned purveyor of all things cinematically depraved. I never thought this film would see the light of day because of the logistical nightmare associated with a compilation like this and rights issues. I&apos;m very glad to say that I was wrong. A few years back Universal released Halloween 2 (1981) on Blu ray with Terror in the Aisles as one of the bonus features. An essential purchase.",

She&apos;s a tough attitude in life because she has no friends and her family finds her crazy. It&apos;s a benefit to see suburbs and underground parts of Istanbul. The film stands far away from the Turkish classical cinema. Esp. Behiye is a clever girl who doesn&apos;t accepts to be an ordinary girl despite she&apos;s good cooking girl. Replikas, Turkish rock group, made great music for Behiye&apos;s scenes. Also the other Turkish popular songs that are used in movie are OK for the spirit of movie.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s probably safe to say with the long history of the Pokémon franchise, none of the returning or diehard fans should be expecting newcomers. The TV series has many seasons and to boot, many movies in between. Any convert would have to start from the very beginning and work their way through all of that just to reach this point. On the other hand, if that is the drive, then fans should be happy that another film in the list of entries remains to have standout qualities for its viewing experience. Know that there are still some aspects that still make it the typical entry for this franchise, but it&apos;s not as average as some of the other previous films. At this point it seems like the films are no longer sticking to the TV show timeline which is okay since the movies never seemed to play into the TV show anyway.\n\nThis entry drops the audience into Ash Ketchum&apos;s world with no indication of time or place, other than around the same time as the shows latest season. Along with him are several other characters that end up weaving their way into the story line which in time cross paths with Ash. Unbelievably, the writer director duo attached to this project is not Kunihiko Yuyama or Hideki Sonoda. This time, it&apos;s Tetsuo Yajima directing and Eiji Umehara writing the screenplay. Umehara has other credits to their name but nothing Pokémon related. However, Yajima does go all the way back to season one, so it&apos;s nice to know the director has experience with the franchise. The key part of the story and direction that make this film another strong entry is the focus of the plot.\n\nUnlike other films which revolved around a legendary Pokémon and how capturing, controlling or destroying them would disturb the balance of nature or something like that. This time it focuses more on the human characters and the development of their arcs. Since this story has nothing to do with the show now, Team Rocket, Ash and Pikachu are the only main cast to return. Risa (Haven Paschall) is a new trainer who has yet to discover how important the connection is between Pokémon and trainer. Toren (Eddy Lee) is a timid researcher who hopes to be able to speak for himself one day for his love of Pokémon. Harriet (Kathryn Cahill) is an elderly citizen who hasn&apos;t learned how to love Pokémon again. Callahan (Billy Bob Thompson) is a lying uncle to his niece Kellie (Laurie Hymes) who doesn&apos;t know he lies. Then there&apos;s Mayor Oliver (Marc Thompson) and his daughter Margo (Erica Schroeder) who&apos;s hiding a secret from him.\n\nThe secret is a legendary Pokémon that no one else knows about. This is one of the couple pitfalls to the movie. No matter what, it seems like no movie can stay clear of directly being about a legendary Pokémon. The good thing is again, the main focus is on the human characters and their development. Of course even with some of these characters are tropes that viewers could anticipate what&apos;ll happen part way through the story because how obvious it is. The voice acting is also obvious but in a good way. None of the performances heard within the viewing experience sounded wrong, off or read poorly. Much of the cast are voice actors who have taken part in the franchise many times before. Additionally, it would be noticeable if they didn&apos;t sound invested in the project.\n\nVisually speaking, the animation is another great part of the viewing experience. The colors and character expressions are as vibrant as ever. There&apos;s also fairly good CGI work thrown in as well. What this has to do with cinematography again though goes unknown. This time handled by Kenji Takahashi and Ryou Kujirai. As for film scores, Shinji Miyazaki returns once more as the composer to the project. Also again there is no domestic release for the album but it does contain an hour of tracks to listen to. At this point it would be more of a surprise if it was released domestically only. However, that won&apos;t happen considering the country of origin of the franchise. The music sounds good as usual and has its moments memorable tunes.\n\nShowing that films related to the franchise can be entertaining, the viewing experience this time focuses on the human characters. As usual it includes the annoying character familiarities and legendary Pokémon, but also completely new characters, great animation, and consistently pleasant music.",

      "name": "Mediocre western....But Yul Brunner is GOD!",
      "reviewBody": "This decent but little known comedy-western is all about acting! Especially Yul Brunner has the time of his life portraying a smooth cattle-thief who just promoted himself to gold-robber. His name is Catlow and he rides through the Texan desert with his gang of thugs, chased by Sheriff Richard Crenna (the two are buddies even though they ought to be enemies) and hired hit man Leonard Nimoy. Everybody  Catlow as well as his pursuers  encounters trouble on their ways, such as aggressive Indians, sneaky Mexican villains and deadly ladies The script of this film (which I believe was filmed in Spain, like many contemporary westerns) isn&apos;t very special and lacks coherence. Sam Wanamaker&apos;s direction is very hammy and it looks like though the cast is pretty much doing what they feel like. Still, it often is enormous fun to see the comic interactions between Brunner and Crenna when they&apos;re trying to outsmart each other with lists and dialogues. Leonard Nimoy is terrific as well, but unfortunately he has little screen time. The beautiful camera-work and exhilarating Country &amp; Western music make you regret that the story is so weak.",

Anybody with an interest in Alternative Music in general, and the British Punk/New Wave &amp; Rave scenes should see this examination of the past 25 years of British rock as filtered through the eyes of Factory Records&apos; Tony Wilson.\n\nPerhaps a bit too &quot;inside&quot; for general audiences, it is a rare example of a music based film that its actually good cinema to go along with it&apos;s raucous soundtrack. Well done, wry and entertaining. My only quibbles are that the filmmakers seem to be preaching to the converted. Except for the tragic Ian Curtis (JOY DIVISION), little attempt is made to inform the uninitiated as to why these bands mattered (NEW ORDER in particular, is just tossed around almost as a brand name, rather than a living breathing artistic unit). Also, we are constantly told how wonderful Manchester is as a city, but we are never really shown why. Steve Coogan&apos;s portrayal of Wilson really makes the film flow and live. It&apos;s not the kind of role that usually wins awards, but here&apos;s hoping some critics group somewhere notices. He&apos;s that fine."

He might have been shooting another movie too, not sure what the reasons where. We get people from previous movies though ... many of them. Especially our favorite guys to hate ... who have a tough job as I already said in the previous movies review.\n\nThe scenes on the Miami beach are just plain ridiculous and really seem like sketch comedy with no real value ... other than to fill the run time of the movie and add a gag per minute &quot;score&quot;. Even in the previous one where they went to a gay bar (again) for example, you may wonder something that is being asked here: why do I keep falling for these? Because it is a comedy would be the right answer I reckon ... anyway, maybe you care, maybe you don&apos;t ... but for a completist, I had to watch them ... and I will revisit the other remaining two movies too ... someday soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Second Sauerkraut Western from Rapid Film with Brad Harris and EUROPEAN FILM AWARD nominee Mario Adorf\n\nAfter the gigantic cinema success of the Karl May film adaptation &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee / The Treasure in the Silver Lake&quot; (1962), the clever film producer Wolf C. Hartwig from Rapid-Film came up with the idea of building on this success of the Rialto and the Constantin Film and To film works by one of May&apos;s predecessors. The writer Friedrich Gerstäcker, who was born in Hamburg in 1816 and died in Braunschweig in 1872, also wrote several westerns. His novel &quot;Die Regulatoren von Arkansas / The Regulators of Arkansas&quot; (1846) became the basis for the second western produced by Rapid-Film after &quot;Die Flusspiraten vom Mississippi / The River Pirates of the Mississippi&quot; (1963). The German-Italian-French co-production (Mario Siciliano was also there with his Metheus film) was directed by the experienced Paul Martin, who had already made &quot;Ein blonder Traum / A Blonde Dream&quot; and &quot;Glückskinder&quot; in the 1930s with his then partner Lilian Harvey. Herbert Reinecker, who would later write all episodes of the globally successful television series &quot;DERRICK&quot; (1974-1998), was also involved in the script. The film, which was released in West German cinemas on November 20, 1964, was shot in the forests of Bohemia and in the Barrandov Studio in Prague.\n\nThe gold rush breaks out in tranquil Marble City when it becomes known that there must be a rich vein of gold somewhere in Indian territory. Many settlers make their way to the small town in Arkansas in the hope of finding great wealth. In this unrest, Phil Stone&apos;s (Brad Harris) father is shot in cold blood. Together with his friend Dan (Horst Frank) he tries to find the murderer. They get to know different people among the newcomers: a resolute mother (UFA star Marianne Hoppe, who was also there in &quot;Schatz im Silbersee&quot;) with her adult children (Dorothee Parker, Olga Schoberova, Thomas Alder), Pastor Benson (Dieter Borsche, also in &quot;Der Schut&quot;), the completely overwhelmed trek leader (Ralf Wolter, also well known as Sam Hawkins, &quot;if I&apos;m not mistaken&quot;), a card-sharp (Mario Adorf, &quot;Winnetou I&quot;, the murderer of Nscho- tschi!) and another obscure guy (Philippe Lemaire). Until the murderer is unmasked, there is still a lot of fighting (Brad Harris is of course back in his element as a stunt choreographer), but also singing (Ralf Paulsen sings the hit &quot;Viel Gold und keine Freunde / Much Gold and No Friends&quot;).\n\nThis is certainly not a Western masterpiece, but the film is a lot of fun. Above all, it offers a reunion with many popular actors. Also in a supporting role is Josef Egger, who, in his signature role as a comical Western oddball, also appeared alongside Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone&apos;s &quot;For a Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964). For Olga Schoberova and Brad Harris, it was the second film together after &quot;Das Geheimnis der chinesischen Nelke / The Secret of the Chinese Carnation&quot; (1964). The American muscle man and the Czech sex bomb formed a dream couple who were also married from 1967 to 1969 and have a daughter together.\n\nThis film, also known as &quot;Alla conquista dell&apos;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Massacre at Marble City&quot;, is well worth seeing and an important example of the short but still popular wave of sauerkraut westerns produced in German-speaking countries.",

The two meet as the Gregor (the chef) begins to frequent the café in which Eden (the waitress) works. After a few encounters Gregor learns that Eden&apos;s daughter Leonie is having a birthday. Gregor makes Leonie a cake and it&apos;s a small taste of this gift that lures Eden further into Gregor&apos;s life. Eden begins to visit Gregor weekly at his restaurant where their friendship blossoms. At first the relationship benefits both as Gregor&apos;s recipes influence Eden&apos;s home life and Eden&apos;s presence inspires Gregor&apos;s cooking. I don&apos;t think to call their friendship a love affair is a stretch. Charlotte Roche and Josef Ostendorf put in strong performances in the main roles. Ostendorf especially puts forth an emotional performance and as wonderful as Roche is, it is Ostendorf who carries the movie. I didn&apos;t know much about the film going in but I am glad to have spent the time to watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "You have to put this movie into perspective! I enjoyed it but it was not until later that I realized that it was not that good! It entertains and that is about it! Well some people may say what more do you expect! Well I suppose I wanted the film to be more than it really is. Then again I also wanted the score to be bigger and better than what it was! The story line is OK and does refer to the Supremes story as we all know... However, the music apart from the &quot;BIG&quot; number is boring. I bought the CD and played it twice and got bored! I immediately listen to Wicked and what a major difference! Now that is what you call a great score! The greatest thing about this movie is Jennifer Hudson! She is perfect for the part and she does a great job with her acting. Also she gives a great performance of a really great song. Everyone knows she was under pressure to reach the levels of Jennifer Holiday and I think she did a good job. However, its was her acting ability that pulled it off.\n\nThe other star of this show was Eddie Murphy. He was quite outstanding in this film and his role was almost believable. The problem he had was that he was not given enough time to develop the role...\n\nThe other huge gap in this film was the relationship that was supposed to exist between Foxx and Hudson. Where was it? I think they could have cut the terrible slushy scenes with Foxx and Knowles and concentrated on the relationship with the other two. Now that would have made the film much more interesting.\n\nAh but we have to have our eye candy Beyonce to sell the film. What a pity any time was spent on her as I must be the only person around who is not bothered if I never saw her again! However, I am certainly going to follow the career of the brilliant Jennifer Hudson! You go girl!",

I predicted it would be a second rate comedy, cheesy, hardly any romance at all, and just was unworthy of my time, even though I was eager to see the wonderful Neve Campbell who I always enjoy in movies and thought that it could not be horrible, hopefully somewhat entertaining. When a few certain scenes happened I thought that I was in for another cliché-ridden rom-com. Then, this film totally surprised me by doing something different and changing itself into a very well done and likable rom-com with cute performances from everyone. \n\nIt&apos;s not your average run-of-the-mill rom-com and while some of my expectations were reached, in ways, other thoughts I had about this film were left far behind in the dirt and I was dumbfounded at what a fluffy and fun movie it was. It managed to be slightly unpredictable, and while it was not that romantic at all, I found the comedy to be easygoing and it was just a lighthearted film. I was in this movie for Neve Campbell and came out liking something different about each character in the movie. I don&apos;t know if this movie is a must see, but if you have even the slightest bit of interest at all in this film, go ahead, watch it. I was pleasantly surprised, pleasantly surprised indeed. It provides some giggles and smiles, and passes the time effectively.",

      "reviewBody": "The lovely Marianna Hill (&quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot;) stars as Arletty, a young woman who&apos;s been corresponding with her artist father Joseph (Royal Dano, &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;) long distance. When his letters become increasingly bizarre and ominous, she goes in search of him. She arrives in the remote coastal California town of Point Dune, and hooks up with three strangers who&apos;ve come to town to document local folklore, including that of a &quot;blood moon&quot;.\n\nIt does not take long for strange and violent things to begin happening, in this little film that is a marvel of weirdness and atmosphere. &quot;Messiah of Evil&quot; strives for both of those elements, and does a fantastic job. At first, it seems as if the filmmakers won&apos;t bother to explain too much, but then some back story is provided around the 71 minute mark. After that, things do become a lot clearer.\n\nThe husband and wife filmmaking team of Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz may have unfortunately torpedoed their career in the 1980s with the debacle that was &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, but they really have never gotten quite enough credit for this enjoyable, twisted independent horror film. It manages to get pretty violent without going over the top in terms of gore. It is really the offbeat ambiance of this film that makes it work as well as it does. It can boast two standout, memorable horror sequences: one in a supermarket, and one in a movie theatre.\n\nHills&apos; performance may be a matter of taste, as she&apos;s clearly on the verge of hysteria throughout (and that extends to her frequent narration). Her co-stars do decent work: Michael Greer (&quot;Fortune and Men&apos;s Eyes&quot;) as the low-key Thom, Joy Bang (&quot;Night of the Cobra Woman&quot;) as the childish Toni, Anitra Ford (&quot;Invasion of the Bee Girls&quot;) as the fed-up Laura, and Charles Dierkop (&apos;Police Woman&apos;) as a service station attendant. The beloved Old Hollywood character actor Elisha Cook, Jr. (&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, etc.) has a great cameo as a drunken local with stories to tell. Non-actor Bennie Robinson has a memorable, creepy presence as a rat-munching albino. At first, Dano&apos;s contribution consists mostly of voice-over, until his equally memorable on-screen appearance late in the game. That&apos;s filmmaker Walter Hill as the desperate man in the opening minute and a half of the film.\n\nExcellent visuals (those murals in the fathers&apos; abode are wonderful) and superb widescreen photography are two more assets in an interesting, off-the-beaten-path horror film that die hard fans of the genre are advised to check out.\n\nEight out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Ice Princess was typical family fluff that was an enjoyable hour and 1/2 escape from the tensions of real life. With that in mind, it was a great success as entertainment and release from stress.\n\nThe plot is simple and &quot;age worn&quot; - a teen named Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is torn between fulfilling the dreams of her parent or following her own dreams. Nothing new here. Yet, the supporting characters of Gen Harwood (Hayden Panettiere) and her mother Tina (Kim Cattrall) also have the same situation. Tina, a skating coach, wants her daughter to become a skating champion, an achievement Tina was unable to fulfill in her own skating career. Thus, both Gen and Casey have something in common: pleasing mom or pleasing themselves.\n\nYet, Gen and Casey were dramatically different. Casey was a brilliant student with her eyes on Harvard while being gifted at skating, too. Meanwhile, Gen excelled only by becoming a slave to skating and sacrificing her schoolwork.\n\nAnd it is with that difference that I believe Disney missed the potential. The &quot;Casey&apos;s&quot; of the world are few and far between, and it is difficult to relate to them: &quot;Oh, gee. Will I go to Harvard because I&apos;m brilliant at school? Or will I become a skating champion because I&apos;m brilliant on the ice?&quot; Because she is so distant from the vast majority of people, she never truly grabbed my empathy.\n\nGen, on the other hand, is very, very real. She is being pushed into a sport by a parent, and her social life and academics are suffering. She faces a real dilemma. Plus, she has no hope of excelling at either academics or skating. Her social life is her only escape from this vise. And Gen is endearing because she seems to have a &quot;good heart&quot; despite the difficulty. And how often we see kids with &quot;good hearts&quot; trapped by situations.\n\nI believe that most of us can relate much better to Gen than to Casey. I would have preferred the character of Gen to be the focus of the story with Casey&apos;s character in the supporting role. It would be tougher, grittier, and more meaningful to the audience.\n\nYeah, we all cheered for Casey, but I was cheering for Gen even more.",

      "reviewBody": "First they came for the Communists, and I didn&apos;t speak up, because I wasn&apos;t a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn&apos;t speak up, because I wasn&apos;t a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn&apos;t speak up, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.\n\nAttributed to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945\n\nWhen faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn.  But when does enough become too much?  Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler&apos;s genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear-mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti-Communist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples&apos; lives.  Inaction makes one no less culpable.\n\nLawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings.   Lawrence doesn&apos;t like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business.  His world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses, and is mistaken for one of &quot;them.&quot; Lawrence&apos;s view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. \n\nWhile the subject matter of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique.  It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice, when placed within a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is Jewish, than he is with the views of his attackers.  He believes that if he corrects this &quot;oversight&quot; that everything will be all right, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand.  \n\nWhether playing a schemer (the only thing I liked about &quot;Fargo&quot;) or a down home nice guy sheriff, William H. Macy&apos;s roles are linked by a common thread -his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance.   Macy nails Lawrence down to the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue.  By showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer.  The supporting cast brings the story together.\n\nLaura Dern is compelling as Gerty, Lawrence&apos;s bombshell wife with a past. Trailer park rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of &quot;a mistake&quot; and unwittingly exacerbates Lawrence&apos;s situation.  Michael Lee Aday (aka &quot;Meatloaf&quot;) is frightening as Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equal parts ignorance and venom, rallying neighbours to his virulent cause.   In the midst of the chaos is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of the aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important questions.  Paymer&apos;s even handed portrayal keeps Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy, making his one of the strongest performances in the film.\n\nThe tight editing and close-cropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions, and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town USA feel - it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of harsh two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack, are powerful without being overwhelming.   Finally, the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era, an essential component in the film&apos;s message.\n\n&quot;Focus&apos;&quot; unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film.  Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.",

As my husband and I are going through the same sort of problems it made it light relief and took the seriousness out of it all. We were laughing out loud at the lengths she want to to get the first sample but possibly it was just nervousness. My husband thought the nurse would be enough to put anyone off giving a sperm sample!! It was on the same sort of lines as Maybe Baby written by Ben Elton although this is not as explicit. I thought the way it showed how committed you need to be to go through fertility investigations was well presented and just how they could push a couple apart. I suppose the moral of the story is that there is hope out there for everyone, just keep on trying!",

He thinks he can put it together again with a hare-brained scheme that involves Celia, the baby and him running away to South America, but there are complications in her household he doesn&apos;t imagine.\n\nJean Renoir&apos;s frequently overlooked movie is competently done, but ignored because, although it clearly has film noir elements in it, including the usual femme fatale, everyone is. to put it unkindly, so stupidly selfish as to be unworthy of much dramatic consideration. The situations go beyond pathos into bathos, and if it were not for the grace notes that Renoir inserts into the production, like the workers&apos; songs, and the actors&apos; ability to inhabitant these foolish characters, it would not be worth the time to look at the movie.\n\nIt&apos;s a well-meaning effort, based on some ethnographic notes that an old school friend of Renoir&apos;s, Jacques Levert took; Marcel Pagnol is listed as executive producer, so clearly someone thought that this was something on the order of the Fanny trilogy in showing the lower classes as they really were.

This is the first work of the German director Alexander Kluge that I see and it is impressive his culture in opera in most of his excerpts from operas. \n\nHe is also ironic, with the short story of a woman that is left by her lover and decides to commit suicide swallowing many pills. A traveling seller sees her dying in her car and helps her to vomit. Then he rapes her, but he is arrested by the police. In the court, the woman does not accuse her rapist telling that she had not felt anything but the rejection of her lover. There is also another unfinished story of the prostitute Betty that is sold to the burglar Kurt Schleich and they are connected when they work together for four weeks to save the life of a foreigner traveling seller that was attacked by Schleich&apos;s partner. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Poder dos Sentimentos&quot; (&quot;The Power of the Feelings&quot;)",

If so, the quality slips past my perceptive apparatus.  I do like his voice, though, so theatrically nasal and so hard to take seriously. Raymond Massey is Black Michael, he of the monocle and the perpetual sneer. Mary Astor and Madeleine Carrol are decorative and provide the men with motives.  Outstanding, though, is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., as Rupert of Hentzau.  It&apos;s often said that a movie is as good as its villain, and that&apos;s as true here as in any other film.  He laughs, he oozes charm, he beats people over the head with iron pipes, he stabs unarmed noblemen, he seduces women, he drugs kings, seems to enjoy betrayal, smokes too much, lies as easily as the rest of us breathe, and instead of fighting to the end like a man he jumps out a window and runs away, or rather swims away.  He quotes poetry: &quot;Oh, woman, in our hour of ease/ uncertain, coy, and hard to please./  When pain and anguish wring the brow/ a ministering angel, thou.&quot; David Niven is a lighthearted friend of the hero.  C. Aubrey Smith is -- well, C. Aubrey Smith.\n\nNiven hadn&apos;t gotten very far in Hollywood until he landed this role, which he was able to do only through the influence of Hollywood&apos;s &quot;British colony.&quot;  He began the shoot by playing the part in the breezy manner we now see on screen.  This displeased the director and the producer, who wanted it dramatic, but when they saw how it looked on film they were tickled pink. (Both Niven and Fairbanks were to go on to meritorious service in World War II.)\n\nThe movie is so undemanding and so rewarding that it was remade several times, twice as a spoof.  The 1950s version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr is about as good as this one, only of course splashier.\n\nThe climax involves a nicely done fight with sabres between Coleman and Fairbanks.  Coleman wasn&apos;t a physical actor and Fairbanks not a fencer, so doubles are used extensively, but without doing much damage.  And it&apos;s curious to note that this was released in the same year as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood,&quot; and both films use some of the same conventions, fighting with furniture, trading wisecracks during the fight, and the use of shadows swashbuckling away on the castle walls.  This despite the fact that different directors were in charge.  Hard to tell whether this is an instance of independent invention or some historical adhesion left over from one of Fairbanks&apos; dad&apos;s early silents.\n\nAnd enjoyable tale, not meant to be taken seriously."

There is convict John Wayne (in his star-making role), scorned prostitute Claire Trevor, drunken doctor Thomas Mitchell (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning role), slick gambler John Carradine, pregnant youngster Louise Platt, shady banker Berton Churchill, whiskey salesman Donald Meek, lawman George Bancroft and driver Andy Devine on this star-studded ride. Soon the characters are turned from would-be stereotypes to very complicated three-dimensional figures that are all deep and humanistic. &quot;Stagecoach&quot; does not only benefit from its actors and screenplay though as legendary director John Ford (Oscar-nominated) shows his ability to mix and mesh quiet, heartfelt moments with amazingly detailed action sequences that were way ahead of their time. A great picture from arguably the cinema&apos;s finest single year of films. 5 stars out of 5."

Meanwhile Ordell asks the fifty-six year-old Max Cherry (Robert Forster), who runs a bail bond business, to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her. Jackie suspects of Ordell&apos;s intention and plots a complicate confidence game with Max to steal half a million dollar from Ordell. \n\n&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; is another great movie by Quentin Tarantino. The story of a sophisticated swindle shows the return of Pam Grier to a lead role and Robert Forster in an important role. The scene in the department store is original, with different perspectives of the same event. However there is a hole since it seems that there is no investigation with the seller but the marked bills. Otherwise she would tell that Jackie Brown had found a bad with towels in the fitting room. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;",

When a circus comes to a small German town, one of the families find out that the director is the long-lost brother of the respectful head of the family, a fact they would prefer to hide. The circus director&apos;s lovely wife manages to save the day and keep the daughter from running away with the circus. Also one of the early performances of Romy Schneider, pre-&quot;Sissi&quot;, and you can understand why the German audience fell for her.",

The story is, despite what everyone says, very engaging and keeps you watching the whole time. Eddie Murphy starred in Coming to America shortly after this, and then his career took a nosedive, although he seems to be making a comeback. If he is given more roles like this, he&apos;ll do better."

They aren&apos;t so much bad, but they have nothing new to add and seem to be more &quot;by-the-numbers&quot; films than anything else.\n\nThe only reason I don&apos;t score it higher is because of ridiculous casting. The 4 sons of Katie are probably close to 40 years apart by age--plus, the 4 look NOTHING like each other. I think Woody Strode would have been almost as convincing as one of John Wayne&apos;s brothers as the 3 they chose.\n\nSo what was so worth watching? Well, the acting is great. Wayne and Martin is a good pairing and the plot of sons seeking revenge is quite compelling. Although not exactly &quot;high brow&quot;, I also like the scene between Wayne and the blacksmith--now THAT&apos;S the way to get some answers when the guy doesn&apos;t want to talk!",

With a classic approach and no frills, this film stands out as one of the few this year that truly captures the essence of the holiday season! The story follows 10-year-old Stine, who, just days before Christmas, finds herself in a quaint town after sneaking onto a train. Seeking refuge from the chilly night, she slips into the home of the reclusive shoemaker Jens Petrus Andersen on Cobbler Street. Initially resistant to the presence of the quirky and outspoken girl, the grumpy old man soon discovers that their unexpected meeting will change both of their lives in surprising ways.\n\nAlongside Kåre Conradi, who plays the beloved shoemaker Andersen, the cast includes Kaya Ekerholt McCurley as Stine, Lene Kongsvik Johansen as Tilla Hjul, Lisa Tønne as Mrs. Franzen, and Martin Lepperød as the postman.\n\nJust sit back and enjoy it! It&apos;s definitely worth your time!",

      "name": "Hitchcock excels in cracking silent about divorce",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Easy Virtue&quot; is an early and impressive Hitchcock in which the master displays a range of innovative filmic devices (such as the way we learn about a marriage proposal by watching the eavesdropping hotel switchboard operator rather than by seeing the man or woman talking on the phone).\n\n The story is based on a play by Noel Coward and (contrary to the other posted IMDB comment on the film) I believe the movie is excellent.  The solo organ score on the videotape I watched was absolutely stunning.\n\n The film tackles a range of issues relating to divorce that would become taboo after adoption of the Production Code in 1934.  Our heroine Larita is married to a drunken brute.  After he catches her almost (but not quite) being seduced by the artist who has been painting her picture, he brings suit for divorce.  Adultery is the only ground for divorce in England at this time and we see a gripping trial scene in which the jury has to decide whether to believe Larita&apos;s denials.  Of course, the jury can&apos;t see beyond its Victorian preconceptions (if she&apos;s alone with him all day, of course they&apos;ve slept together) and it finds her guilty.\n\nNow a disgraced woman of &quot;easy virtue,&quot; Larita takes to the Riviera where she ensnares a rich young suitor (after he hits her in the eye with a tennis ball).  Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t tell him about her checkered past and naturally Larita&apos;s family hates her on sight.\n\nThis story takes on a range of highly relevant divorce issues.  The film skillfully lampoons the absurdity of fault divorce and the need to try questions of adultery to a jury.  It takes quite seriously the way that society treated a divorced woman as damaged goods.  It attacks the sexual double standard with zeal and skewers the stuffy English aristocracy to great effect.  After 1934, divorce didn&apos;t exist in the movies (except in comedies where the spouses remarry in the end) and the important legal and social issues raised by divorce and female sexuality were erased from the screen by the censors.  Very few early films (silent or sound) ever dealt so candidly with the harsh realities of divorce; &quot;Easy Virtue&quot; compares favorably to the outstanding &quot;One More River&quot; (1934) in its straightforward and quite moving treatment of the issues.",

      "reviewBody": "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) is a movie I originally saw in theaters, is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture involves our old friend, Bilbo Baggins, as a youth when Gandalf the wizard shows up at his door about an adventure. Bilbo says no but that night 12 dwarfs show up at his door and tells him a story about a dragon that stole their homeland and gold. They would like to return home, regain their kingdom and need Bilbo&apos;s help to make that happen. Bilbo will try to say no, but we all know he can&apos;t.\n\nThis movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Martin Freeman (Black Panther), Ian McKellen (X-Men), Andy Serkis (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Richard Armitage (Into the Storm), Graham McTavish (Rambo) and James Nesbitt (Match Point).\n\nThe settings, cast, special effects, attire and props in this are absolutely out of this world. The introduction of the characters is hilarious and very well done. I adored how well the perception of the characters of each other is depicted and how that evolves over time. There&apos;s some war scenes in this that&apos;s awesome and every scene with the orcs riding the wolves is tremendous. The goblin king sequence in the cave is well executed and it&apos;s impossible not to love the riddle game with Gollum. The final battle at the cliff was perfect.\n\nOverall, this is an underrated gem that gets overshadowed by the greatness of Lord of the Rings. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "To look at the premise, and definitely to start watching, there are familiar narrative strains in &apos;Danika&apos;; I think of one title in particular that came out just a few years before this one. That doesn&apos;t mean that another rendition can&apos;t be worthy - and if nothing else is true, the occurrences the protagonist experiences are distinctly horrifying, and increasingly so. Joshua Leibner&apos;s screenplay does a fine job of maintaining a strong air of mystery about the narrative, and conjuring major uncertainty about what is real or not. Just as much to the point, there&apos;s unmistakable complexity in the lead role that Marisa Tomei navigates with all the great skill we know she possesses; between the visions and the increasingly erratic behavior, the picture comes off foremost as a thriller, but with a considerable sense too of psychological horror. This may not be wholly perfect, but &apos;Danika&apos; is duly engaging and compelling, and pretty solid.\n\nAll the blood, gore, stunts, and effects that go into realizing the more jarring moments are very well executed, helping the incidents to feel as real as they could be for the audience. It helps that so capable a cast is assembled; led by Tomei, everyone demonstrates fine nuance, range, and personality to bring the story to life. Able direction and sequencing work to amplify all the vitality there is in the screenplay, with varied scene writing focused around the protagonist&apos;s seemingly broken sense of reality. All the contributions of those behind the scenes are swell.\n\nAll this is well and good. However, there does come a point where the story makes a sea change, and the last stretch of the picture is straightforward drama. It&apos;s very well done, and fairly impactful, with heartbreaking but important and commendable themes spotlighted in the last scene especially. Only - these last minutes are a major break from the sensibilities that &apos;Danika&apos; had been fostering all along, and so it feels like a curveball. The plot is complete and coherent, and ultimately very worthwhile, even as a couple scenes may feel a tad maudlin. Above all, I just wish the writing were slightly more even and consistent one way or another, especially in tone, for that would have made all the difference.\n\nWhen all is said and done I do quite like this. I think every constituent part stands fairly tall, and it&apos;s reasonably engrossing. It just doesn&apos;t necessarily stand out compared to other movies of a similar broad thrust Ultimately it&apos;s more a drama/thriller with tinges of horror on the edges, and with that in mind - especially for fans of Tomei or others involved, this is a decent way to spend 80 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "Philip Noyce&apos;s politically charged thriller starring Academy Award winner Tim Robbins and Derek Luke is brilliant and striking picture. When Patrick Chamusso (Luke) is wrongfully charged with terrorist charges and his family violently offended by the leader of the operation Nik Vos, (Robbins) Patrick joins the rebellion to fight against the regime.\n\nAs the film touches on the many tones of politics, racism, and economic problems in South Africa, the emotional and dramatic quality of the film is the beauty of it. While the screenplay has flaws in character arc, the film is as beautiful as it is tragic. Derek Luke puts forth the best performance of his short career and is on his way to many potent and demanding roles in the future. His humanity and heroism shown in Patrick carries the film on his shoulders and when years pass, this will be film we will remember Luke&apos;s breakout turn besides Antwone Fisher.\n\nTim Robbins brings forth a frightening turn with his spot on accent but is a little distracting and a miscast. With no direction for his character to go, many questions are left unanswered and frustrates the viewer. He still shows us he is one of the best working actors today when put in the right role.\n\nBonnie Henna who puts forth an admirable effort as the supportive wife, &quot;Precious,&quot; leaves the audience a bit disenchanted but has the strong will that makes the viewer worry for her. While Patrick is training and gets his codename, &quot;Hotstuff&quot; in which the film is adapted from of the same title, Henna is given enough screen time to run with her role and soar.\n\nNoyce creates some great cinematic moments with Luke but I have to say, I give Luke much of the credit. He completely engulfed himself in his role. His charm and charisma is his strongest attribute and lets the film succeed as much as it can. The film however never really &quot;catches fire&quot; rather sparks up all over the place.\n\nGrade: ***/****",

Think is I&apos;m freeing some space on my watchlist and I&apos;m watching movies that I have that have bad iMDB score. 90% of them I don&apos;t even make it to the end. but this one was not the case.\n\nIt may seem like a bad movie because of the over the top style, a kinda cheap look &amp; feel and crazy silly but clichè yakuza plot. but ten minutes into the movie I thought all of those things were actually good, and then half through I thought it was a solid 7, certainly not a 5\n\nI like all things japanese so maybe I&apos;m biased, but I thought the directing and the overall style and tone of the movie were more than good, actors were all pretty decent and likable and action sequences were the way they needed to be, extreme and with a b movie-esque feel to them\n\nMost of all I found it extremely funny in a silly way, but nothing short of say From Dusk Till Dawn and Grindhouse silly kind of funniness.\n\nI&apos;d definitely recommend it if you like comics, japanese culture or just an original action-comedy flick",

The Zuzana character was very beautiful and especially later when she is given traditional braids and gowns. \n\nThe story was cute and somewhat believable. Real chemistry is found with the Michael and Zuzana relationship. The other characters have very funny moments and the music is catchy. A good late night flick, not raunchy but warm.

      "reviewBody": "I watched because it&apos;s in German and I can confirm that this film is excellent for German listening practice. The dialogue was extremely simple and brief so it was very easy to follow. I watched with German subtitles for any dialogue I might miss and I barely needed them.\n\nSo that&apos;s one reason why it&apos;s not so great as a film; the script.\n\nWhat I liked was that the plot unfolded in a much more realistic way than I expected (I won&apos;t expand because I don&apos;t want to include spoilers) however, the various techniques employed to constantly remind viewers of the tag lines was fairly amateur: certain phrases kept being repeated and the entire film has been done 1000 times before.\n\nI didn&apos;t like Mina Tander in the lead. Her acting was by-the-numbers and she just didn&apos;t have much charisma in this film. By that I mean, she didn&apos;t stand out. It didn&apos;t help that Laura de Boer was, in contrast, extremely charismatic and natural. I didn&apos;t believe the friendship between the two; their scenes felt very forced as did their smiles however, the acting was fine for the most part.\n\nSince watching Wir sind die Nacht, I&apos;m now a big fan of Max Riemelt but he does need to work on becoming a different person in his films as I&apos;ve seen him use the same acting techniques and facial expressions in a few of his films now (e.g. Die Welle).\n\nOverall, it&apos;s an average ghost story with one (or two) surprises but nothing new. It&apos;s perfect for those looking for German language films and people with a bit of time to kill who like typical ghost stories.\n\n5.8/10",

I had really loved Zombie&apos;s first film, HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, and was looking forward to seeing how he was going to &quot;re-create&quot; the characters from that first film into this new one. \n\nStylistically, this film is exceptional. Zombie knows how to build tension and has a real gift for being able to pay homage to the horror flicks of the 70&apos;s without insulting or copying them. His choices in casting is genius and the performances in this film are quite good. \n\nHowever, gone is the camp-value he infused into CORPSES. This film takes itself much more seriously and this does not help. In fact, the fact that Zombie focuses more on horror and torture without the same level of dark humor makes the film come off as somewhat cruel. Are we to actually enjoy seeing the victims tortured? Somehow, the fun of his first film is absent. \n\nHowever, for those of us who have an appreciation for the films of the original 70&apos;s renegade film makers such as Tobe Hooper -- you can&apos;t help but enjoy Zombie&apos;s style of filming. This film also enjoys have some of the best southern rock ever created to serve as its soundtrack. \n\nThe three lead actors stand out and give great performances, but one wishes Zombie would have allowed them to go a bit more over the top. Karen Black did not return to play Moma Firefly which is too bad, but the actress who takes over the role does a great job. \n\nIn the end -- I think this is an interesting and valid second film from Rob Zombie, but I hope that he allows his cast and his audience to have a bit more fun. The world has enough torture and violence -- if we are to see it in a film it needs to give us a bit of a scare and a bit of a laugh. If only he had utilized that dark/twisted since of humor a bit more. \n\nStill, it is worth a look -- but not for those of you who get upset by violence. And, please, this is not a movie for children. There was a child at last night&apos;s screening. That poor baby is going to be scarred for life!",

I liked it but haven&apos;t thought anything about it since. WILDCATS came on television this morning, and I started watching it to kill time before getting hooked on the goofy but likeable story. It is really a funny, cute movie.\n\nFirst, let me say I am not a fan of football movies; however, I have enjoyed movies such as THE LONGEST YARD, NORTH DALLAS FORTY and AGAINST ALL ODDS (to name a few) where an interesting story and characters add life to an otherwise &quot;sports film.&quot; Yes the football scenes are fun to watch, but what makes the movie truly watchable is the feeling Goldie adds to her character (like in PRIVATE BENJAMIN) plus the developing struggle between her ex-husband concerning her new career and raising of her children. Its predictable in many ways, but hey, it was nice to watch a movie that made me feel happy for a change (rather than depressed or confused as so many contemporary movies seem to do)."

The adult stars are Bette Davis and Christopher Lee as an old dowager financing a mad scientist in some nefarious experiments.\n\nThese two happen on the alien kids from Witch Mountain, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenman, when the kids are on holiday to Earth once again. They kidnap Ike after seeing an example of his powers of levitation and seek to use him and fit him with a mind control device that Lee&apos;s been perfecting.\n\nLee&apos;s dreaming some big dreams and Davis has some more mundane schemes like a trip to some gambling house or racetrack. Both of them looking like they are having one grand old time hamming it up for the cameras.\n\nOf course the film wouldn&apos;t work at all if it were not for the winning personalities of Richards and Eisenman. Both come across as real kids, not sure of the extent of their own powers rather than Hollywood juvenile actors.\n\nThe whole of the film is Richards pursuing and trying to rescue her brother and in the process she recruits a gang of juveniles escaping from a truant officer played by the ever deadpan funny Jack Soo. Eventually Soo joins forces with the kids and proves of some help.\n\nBoth Escape to Witch Mountain and this sequel are fine family entertainment, some of the best that Disney studio produced.",

      "reviewBody": "In many ways, &quot;The Good Night&quot; is like the Thurber story &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;. It&apos;s also about a dull man who retreats into a fantasy world instead of living out his fantasies for real. But unlike &quot;Mitty&quot;, &quot;The Good Night&quot; is incredibly dull and lifeless....and makes for difficult viewing.\n\nGary (Martin Freeman) is a man whose best years, it seems, are behind him. In his youth, he&apos;d been in a rock band. Now, he&apos;s writing music for TV commercials and his marriage is hollow and unfulfilling. So, he begins to retreat into a fantasy world in his dreams where a perfect woman (Penelope Cruz) loves him unconditionally and wants him physically. What&apos;s to become of his marriage and what will happen if he actually in real life meets a woman who seems to be the fantasy lady?\n\nIt&apos;s odd that the film is about a guy who writes music and yet there is so little incidental music in the film. Too often it&apos;s quiet and flat...which, I understand , it a metaphor for Gary&apos;s inner life. But it makes for tough viewing and the film really could have used an infusion of energy.\n\nBy the way, although I am a trained therapist, I&apos;ve never put a ton of stock in dream interpretation...particularly Freudian dream interpretation. But clearly this film IS incredibly Freudian and Gary tends to use his fantasies as wish fulfillment....and Analytic psychotherapists would no doubt adore the movie since it&apos;s based so much on Freudian concepts.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s not a bad film but it&apos;s also one which COULD have been so much better. A story about mid-life crises and disaffection is potentially very watchable and insightful...but this one just didn&apos;t hit that mark. The issues it touches on are great and I liked the ending...but why did the journey there need to be so lifeless?",

      "reviewBody": "Helmut Käutner adapted the jolly novelette by Barbara Noack into a lighthearted and joyful romantic comedy with witty dialogue in the very good script. First viewing and an only rudimentary knowledge of the German cinema of the 50&apos;s  may let the viewer escape all the niceties of the film. Noack&apos;s novelette partly takes place within the German film industry and Käutner expanded this premise to satirize the making of the same film, giving him the opportunity to mock the reigning laws within the German cinema. Furthermore he enriched the story by making the lead character into a more independent woman than in the novel.\n\nQuite some though friendly, but always clear scoffing at the average sugar sweet German films of the 50&apos;s is going on. In the scene where the possibilities of filming the script are discussed a little statue of a deer is in the picture: the Bambi was a German film prize. Sonja Ziemann, regular in the Heimatfilm, at one moment says: That is what the people always want to see. Even a standard scene in genre Mountain film like the meeting of the girl and her two suitors in an Alpine hut, is taken care of. Käutner does not spare himself too; he always had a bit part for himself in his films and in this one he is a journalist saying to Bernhard Wicki (who plays the film director(!) very well): &quot;I am against directors playing in their own films&quot;.\n\nKäutner&apos;s direction is immaculate and I consider this stylish comedy one of his best films of the 50&apos;s and to be preferred to the film &quot;Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot; (made in 1956, just before this one) that gave him international recognition. The very good cinematography of Heinz Pehlke (his first in colour) in combination with the fine set and costume design make it a visually rewarding film as well. The music and songs by Michael Jary (text probably by Käutner) add to the enjoyment.\n\nThe cast is good and Liselotte Pulver is extremely well as Juliana and Paul Hubschmidt is well type-cast as the boring Swiss. And of course there could have been only one actor for the fictive part of Herr Uri: Rudolf Platte, who again only has a bit part but plays it like he has to carry the film. Anny Ondra and Max Schmeling have cameos.",

      "reviewBody": "Frankenstein Created Woman is the fourth film in the classic Hammer Frankenstein series. According to the audio commentary on the Shout Factory Blu Ray release it is regarded as &quot;a dark fairy tale for adults&quot;. They also draw some parallels to Cinderella to hammer( no pun intended) that point. This film has less to do with Victor Frankenstein and more to do with the tragic love story of a disfigured woman and her boyfriend. Stealing the thunder from Peter Cushing is not easy and these young actors did a fantastic job. The score is fantastic and the film looks great to boot. The film is heavy with subtext and is ahead of it&apos;s time in many different aspects. Frankenstein Created Woman is very much the thinking man&apos;s horror movie ( or woman, expect a little gender bending). However, it doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t deliver on lush visuals, Gothic atmosphere and big breasted women that are expected from a Hammer horror production. Terance Fisher is the best director to work at Hammer and every movie he works on is special and outstanding in every possible way. Frankenstein Created Woman is mostly a bloodless film, but it still is quite violent, dark and twisted for a movie of this period. Overall, this is a great movie and one I highly recommend and enjoy.",

So if you see it, be careful. It is really powerful. I know a little about Von Trier and have seen a handful of his films...this one, for me, takes the cake, over many movies out in the world.

      "reviewBody": "WHAT&apos;S YOU NUMBER? is a flimsy bit of fluff based on the novel &apos;20 Times A Lady&apos; by Karen Bosnak and transformed for the screen by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden. It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today&apos;s dating/quasi-relationship scene, but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny, so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back, put feet up, and giggle along with it genre.\n\nAlly Darling (!) (Anna Faris) has a history of having many ex-boy connections who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters (Ally has exceeded the norm) she freaks and believes that she can&apos;t find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her ex-encounters searching for Mr Right, she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea (Chris Evans), a would-be musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them, to act as her detective. The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.\n\nFor once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent (and fingernails-on-the- blackboard voice) and she looks terrific. But the biggest treat in the film is Chris Evans appearing in the buff often enough to keep the movie on: not only does he enjoy his Adonis body but he seems happy allowing it to buff up an otherwise routine comedy part. There is another attraction in the wings - Oliver Jackson-Cohen - who seems to have a future in film. Tuck in the always reliable Blythe Danner and Ed Begley, Jr and this is a cast worth an evening&apos;s outing. But the treat on top of the confection is the eye candy generously shared by Chris Evans. \n\nGrady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "The lives of working class Americans are shamefully under-represented by Hollywood, and when a poor person is depicted (as something other than a criminal), it&apos;s almost always with the subtext of hope and the American dream.  But hope isn&apos;t what drives someone, like the real-life Karen Silkwood, to risk her life working with plutonium for the only employer in a company town.  Silkwood didn&apos;t find hope, but she did get scared, and angry, and put her job (and those of her colleagues) at stake to uncover dangerous practices before dying a mysterious death.  &apos;Silkwood&apos; the movie doesn&apos;t give us the glib conclusions of a conspiracy thriller (it refrains from giving an opinion on her cause of death), but it does give an excellent portrait of life at the bottom, and the mounting sense of claustrophobia and paranoia that accompanied Karen&apos;s perilous voyage of discovery.  Meryl Streep does an excellent job in the title role, portraying a woman gradually losing her sanity, and the whole cast is good, even Cher in an unglamorous role.  In conclusion, this is a serious and important film; and a reminder for the fortunate how hard, and ugly, life can be, even in the &quot;land of the free&quot;.",

It&apos;s one of those formidable European co-productions, produced in versions in three languages with different casts for each, but with Brigitte Helm in all three. Director G.W. Pabst does what Feyder could not manage in the silent version, infuse the production with an air of hallucination; there&apos;s little to explain the characters&apos; motivation except for sheer lust, and so it becomes a variation of the Erda, with Helm&apos;s Antinea ultimately destroying not only the men she captivates, but herself as well.\n\nIt&apos;s a hypnotic movie, but when I came up for air at the end, I still had to suppress an urge to giggle. What was Atlantis doing in the middle of the Sahara?",

It would be great for some Christian elementary school classes, that might want try something different during the holiday season.\n\nI would classify this special as a &quot;B&quot; movie. The A&apos;s being the ones that got popular and constantly repeated. This means that this isn&apos;t bad, but wasn&apos;t given the chance to catch on. It&apos;s a pity the networks didn&apos;t replay this a few more times when it came out.\n\nThe scene when the animals lose their one night gift is particulary poignant, and it does stick in the mind.\n\nI hope it comes out on DVD in the next few years, along with a few other Christmas seventies cartoons that seem to be forgotten these days."

It doesn&apos;t really have enough slapstick in it and the comical situations, although good, feel far fetched and perhaps a bit awkward, especially toward the ending.\n\nThey could have done something more interesting with the concept of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy joining the police force. They get themselves into some comical and dumb situations but it all is perhaps a bit too formulaic. That is the main reason why &quot;Midnight Patrol&quot; is an enjoyable but at the same time very forgettable Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts.\n\nLloyd French never was the best or most consistent director of Laurel &amp; Hardy movies. His movies are certainly enjoyable but lacking in originality or true creativity at the same time.\n\nI&apos;m beginning to sound negative but of course this movie is not an horrible one to watch. Mainly the Laurel &amp; Hardy fans will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie, although also they have to admit that this is far from the best and/or most memorable Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Elio Petri&apos;s stylish, rewardingly literate, sacred cow slaughtering satire provides a feast of visually stimulating filmmaking from this inventive Italian iconoclast, and, lastly, but by no means beastly, the impeccable, Ennio Morricone score is yet another sublime sonic triumph from the unrivalled musical iconoclast! Deservedly rescued from languishing ignominiously in some forgotten film vault, Petri&apos;s immersive, fascinatingly enigmatic agitprop thriller positively scintillates on HD, and resolutely retains all of its considerable power to delight, and enthral those canny cineastes who have the conspicuously good taste to track down Petri&apos;s unusually cogent masterpiece!",

Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.\n\nWhen &quot;Silverlake Life&quot; was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.",

His Character is believable and you actually feel sorry for him. Busey fans as well as fans of Mimi Rogers will not be disappointed. Mimi is great to look at ( I mean , wouldn&apos;t take a fancy to her) Gary just oozes an evil, but sensitive quality in this film . The ending is climactic too , once the plot is revealed and you&apos;ll be hard pushed not to grip the arms of your sofa !"

      "reviewBody": "I just watched this movie online... Wow!! It&apos;s so hideously bad it makes some notoriously bad movies by Edward D. Wood look like Citizen Kane, the only motivation I could think that this abomination was produced in the first place was simply because some guys had a couple of tacky-looking fancy dress outfits laying around in the loft and decided to make a movie with them.\n\nThe plot (or lack of) consists of a particularly creepy Santa stranded on a beach in Florida because his sleigh is trapped beneath two grains of sand (we learn that his reindeer have already flown back to the North Pole courtesy of some grainy-looking stock footage). Santa sings a song and waves his hand around a lot and telepathically enlists the help of some neighbourhood kids to bring their household pets to help him out of this pickle. One girl turns up with a guy in a Gorilla suit, while others with a variety of farmyard animals. Even Huck Finn &amp; Tom Sawyer join Santa&apos;s helpers, but this is all to no avail, so he decides to tell the story of Thumbelina to some REALLY bored looking children...\n\nNow, the version I watched didn&apos;t have the story of Thumbelina at this point (like the original release) and it simply fades to black and then back to Santa being creepy.\n\nFor no reason whatsoever, some other guy in a white rabbit costume drives a Fire Truck with an awful lot of children passengers towards the beach only to detour through an amusement park and finally get to the beach while the children sing songs. Santa and the rabbit character mumble to each other and then they take off. The kids run back to Santa&apos;s sleigh and it mysteriously vanishes.\n\nThen comes the Thumbelina adaptation, which, in a nutshell is a fairly pretty girl singing songs around the same amusement park Mr. Rabbit took an inane detour through. The narration of the story sounds like it&apos;s coming through a PA system and the sets look like something in the average 4th graders Christmas nativity. However, this is the best part of SC&amp;TICB simply because the girl who plays Thumbelina can carry a tune when she sings.\n\nI can only imagine that the intention of this movie was to advertise &quot;Pirate World&quot;, the amusement park where most of it is based, quite the way Santa Claus (1985) advertised a certain fast food restaurant and soft drink brand.\n\nAs a movie, this is the poorest you could ever find. Everything about it is amateur, from the acting to the set design to the photography, editing and direction. Even the songs are akin to the type a 6-year-old could come up with. The kazoo-heavy score is also inferior. This could surpass for entertainment as a movie, and if it&apos;s intended to be a 90-minute advert, it fails at that too. Pirate World shut down around 1975. With this movie to advertise it... I&apos;m expecting Santa&apos;s wake very soon...",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. So Close. This is painfully close to being a great film. Although still very good at presenting issues normally not seen on film, director Gore Verbinski (&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; &quot;The Ring&quot;) falls just short of making a very powerful statement.\n\nPlease do not let the trailer fool you. This is not slapstick comedy like &quot;Anchorman&quot;. This is deep, often dark subject matter addressing the emotional struggles men face when dealing with a bad divorce, trying to maintain a relationship with kids, and the pressures of trying to make one&apos;s own dad proud (or at least gain acceptance). So often Hollywood deals with the plight of the woman and her emotional turmoil. Instead we are &quot;treated&quot; with watching a man&apos;s attempt to live up to (what he thinks are) expectations of others and how somehow the right job will make everything OK ... his life will be whole.\n\nNicolas Cage gives another outstanding performance as &quot;The Weather Man&quot; on a Chicago TV station. To add to the complexity, he is not a meteorologist and he is being courted by a national morning talk show featuring Bryant Gumbel. Two areas with this character are poorly written in my opinion. First, Cage&apos;s hair weave is bloody awful. At least in Dallas, weather men all look like Televangelists with perfect hair. His is always askew ... don&apos;t they have hair/make-up staff in Chicago? Second, the character is written as too much of a loser in all aspects. He is not just struggling, he is not someone any guy or girl would want to hang with. The film tries, but fails, to show the &quot;switch&quot; come on when Cage steps in front of the camera. They tell us this happens, but it needed to be presented much clearer.\n\nPlaying Cage&apos;s father, Michael Caine is a pretty intimidating figure as he is confused about his son&apos;s direction in life while at the same time facing a very dark future of his own. Caine is wonderful in the role and when he tells his son &quot;Sometimes in life, you just have to chuck it&quot;, we really get it and hope that Cage does as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Hope Davis is cast as yet another frigid &quot;B&quot; yuppie whom I don&apos;t understand how any man could be attracted to. Yet somehow this is the woman Cage wants back. Time to stretch your talent a bit Hope. You showed plenty of promise in &quot;About Schmidt&quot; and have been working steadily since. But to take the next step as an actress, you need to try a new character. Gil Bellows (&quot;Aly McBeal&quot;) has a creepy role as Cage&apos;s teenage son&apos;s counselor. He is responsible for some of the most uncomfortable moments as well as a way for Cage to finally cut loose.\n\nAs I said, this is a very good movie that falls just short of greatness. While providing insight into the male psyche, it fails to deliver the message or solution it seemed to be leading up to. However, it is nice to see a man portrayed as something other than a superhero, adulterer, international spy or Olympic caliber lover.",

      "reviewBody": "A renegade USAF general, Lawrence Dell (Burt Lancaster) and his band (Paul Winfield , Burt Young , William Smith) , escape from a military prison and take over an ICBM silo near Montana . They have invaded Silo 3 and are prepared to launch nine nuclear missiles . Head saboteur General Lawrence threatens to provoke World War 3 unless the government and President of the United States (Charles Durning , though Paul Newman was offered the role , but turned it down) carry out their conditions , as they demand the followings : ¨Ten million dollars , Air Force One (it was only painted on one side) and you Mr President¨ as he must reveal details of a secret meeting and confess the Vietnam policies and crimes . \n\nThrilling film about nuclear threatening that contains noisy action , suspense , intrigue , thrills and being pretty entertaining . One of the very few films made in the late 1970&apos;s to be shown with an intermission and an extended use of split screens functioning to a large degree in tightening the intrigue . The movie&apos;s weakest point is the television style and some ridiculous dialogues as when an enemy appears and Paul Winfield tells ¨Perhaps he might be a midget¨and Lancaster responds : ¨There are no midgets in the United States Air Force¨. Based on a novel by Walter Wager titled ¨Viper three¨ with interesting screenplay from Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch . The secret policy is closely based on the 1957 book &quot;Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy&quot; by Henry Kissinger, in which the future Secretary of State outlines a strategy committing the US to promoting regional conflicts to deter the Soviets&apos; initiating full-scale war. Top-notch acting by Lancaster as a thinking madman who holds America to ransom by kidnapping atomic missiles . Burt Lancaster initially turned the script down when he was first approached about the project, but eventually agreed to do it after Robert Aldrich became attached to the picture. This is Burt Lancaster&apos;s fourth collaboration with director Robert Aldrich, after Apache (1954), Veracruz (1954) and Ulzana&apos;s raid (1972). Very good support cast such as Roscoe Lee Browne as James Forrest , Joseph Cotten as Secretary of State , Melvyn Douglas as Zachariah Guthrie , Richard Jaeckel as Capt. Stanford , William Marshall as Attorney General , Gerald S. O&apos;Loughlin as Brig. Gen. O&apos;Rourke , Richard Widmark as Gen. Martin and final film of Charles McGraw , Lionel Murton and Leif Erickson . Atmospheric cinematography by Robert Hauser , all of the scenes were shot with two cameras running . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith . \n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by Robert Aldrich , he even turned down a large salary and a 10% profit stake in ¨A bridge too far¨1977) in order to make this film and he finished the film ten days ahead of schedule . Here Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s, and directed his first feature in 1953 (Big Leaguer ,1953). Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films, collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . He was an expert on warlike (Dirty Dozen , The Angry Hills , Attack , Ten seconds to hell) and Western (The Frisko kid , Ulzana&apos;s raid, Apache , Veracruz , The last sunset) . Rating : acceptable and decent movie , it&apos;s a must see for Burt Lancaster fans .",

She finally finds love in Felice (brilliant: Maria Schrader), a Jewish girl, part of the Berlin Lesbian scene. Lilly breaks with her husband, despite (or because?) of all the terror around they are having an intense love affair until finally the terror proves to be stronger... All this sounds very made-up but it is a true story. Lilly is still living in Berlin having stayed alone since then. And all this sounds like a kitschy and schmaltzy movie, but thanks to the fact that it is not a Hollywood production it isn&apos;t. Much more it is overwhelming and always stays near-to-life. A movie about the huming being&apos;s will to be happy despite all insanity. Absolutely recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "Having watched back to back the two versions - Paradise For Three (1938) and this, the mother-tongue but later version (1955), I am not sure which is the better version. In having not read the actual story, I can&apos;t say which is nearer to the literature. The basic skeleton has been maintained same in both version, A Millionaire wins a prize in a slogan competition - sponsored by his own empire - and accepts the prize - a fortnight in a ski resort. That&apos;s where the snow comes in - not because of getting marooned in some snow storm (for example as in Il tempo si è fermato) - so that way both the names are a bit misnomer, but this one is nearer to the right one.\n\nThe three (in either case) - are the First Prize winner young man, the second prize winner (the millionaire) and his trusted valet. The reason of his going is his childishness - which had been shown in different way in the two versions (in the Holly version, the bargaining with a young boy - for his stamps) whereas here those were not resorted to. Some &quot;Narrator&quot; statement in the beginning smoothed the field for the Hero to step on.\n\nBoth the versions had obvious flaws, but in none of them had been really too noticeable to be irritating. Unfortunately - as it is reported, the German director wasn&apos;t even aware that a movie had already been made on the story- so he really couldn&apos;t take advantage of the better parts of that. May be had he seen that, or some one makes a hybrid, that would be perfect.\n\nIn the Hollywood version, the daughter is a society girl, whereas here she is a professional, the crown princess is in fact ready and capable of taking over the empire from the baby-father. The father in both case is child, but in Holly the daughter too is as frolicky as the father, but here the father is blessed with two mothers - the daughter and the old governess. In fact in Holly version, one could suspect whether there was some other feeling Mrs Kunkel had, in fact almost feel it, but here there is absolutely no doubt.\n\nThe second positive part of this version is - the lead up to the excursion - in Holly he has gone by deception, (in fact I couldn&apos;t get how they came to know of it). But here, it was known, and they have decided to humour the child to go for a stroll in the park, of course with the guardian (the valet) to keep a strict eye. In fact here I had a strong suspicion, whether the Princess managed the award for her father (playing Santa) ? It seemed quite possible - and that would have taken the chance element off. Upto half way of the movie this was a definitely far superior version, but then a small, but major flaw surfaced. In both the version, the mistaken-millionare was treated as a servant - but Holly had made it convincing - the destruction of cutlery and the pay-back by manual work. Here it was just ordered, without reason. That is simply not palatable. In Holly version, the gold digging divorcee had very quickly changed her target, when she realised who was who. But here she didn&apos;t and focused on the wrong one (she didn&apos;t get enlightened of the reality). In either case - it was just a bit too fast to be palatable - the change of target would have warned the target in Holly, and the open seduction in this version was more as one would expect from a street-walker than one who hobnobs with Barons and others. This should have been kept a bit more sublime - since after all (though mistakenly), she is trying to catch a rich man as husband. The finale too here was much sweeter than the Holly version. But in Holly the young man couldn&apos;t afford to have a mother, hence this solution was out.\n\nAs I said, I have a mixed feeling about the superiority - I would give this just a small edge - and that too because, I will take the Director at his words, that he hasn&apos;t seen the other one, and hence this isn&apos;t a remake, but stand-alone. In remakes, I am much more brutal, when plus points of one version become minus in later one.",

      "reviewBody": "Matt Lee Whitlock is the chief of police in a town in Florida. He has an ex-wife on the job and a girlfriend dieing of cancer. When Ann tells him that her husband has changed the details of her life insurance policy, Matt agrees to be named the new beneficiary in order to keep any payout safe. Meanwhile, under pressure to help her treatment, Matt takes drug money from the police safe however, when Ann and her husband are both killed in an arson attack on their home a murder investigation is launched  with Matt&apos;s ex-wife Alex heading it up. Initially quick to cover all links between him and Ann, Matt soon finds that all the clues are starting to point to him and realises that he is being framed.\n\nDespite a solid (and sexy) cast, this looked too much like an average crime thriller to bother me to go to the cinema. However on DVD I decided to give it a go over the weekend as it seemed more suited to the small screen. Indeed the plot is no great shakes and is essentially a series of little set pieces on the way to a twist that was so apparent that the film doesn&apos;t even really deliver it with any great effort. However this is not to say it is no good, but just that it is nothing particularly special. The direction is good and it really helps the film keep a good sense of pace in the way the camera spins around in even the office environment but really it is the cast that make this stand out from the many other crime thrillers that never make it to the cinema.\n\nWashington may well be slumming it here (he criticised it because he said all he did was run) but he holds the attention really well. His character doesn&apos;t really act like he should do and sometimes he is just plain wrong but Washington is suitably frantic and sweaty like a man hemmed in on all sides. Mendes is enjoyable even if she has no real character to speak of either, while Lathan rounds out the sex appeal with an OK performance but hardly the femme fatale that she should have been. Cain does better than he usually does and credit to him that he does manage to hold his own with Washington. Generally none of the lead three really act at the level that they can but their presence makes it more interesting.\n\nOverall, my (and most viewers) assumptions were mostly right  it is an enjoyable little thriller but not one that is really worth hunting down. The big name cast are sexy and do reasonably well with the little they are given and director Franklin injects more pace that it probably deserved and the end result is a solid enough little film but not one that really does anything special."

      "name": "VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS (Jaromil Jires, 1970) ***1/2",
      "reviewBody": "An aimless but fascinating surreal fantasy  a sort of adult-oriented version of &apos;Alice In Wonderland&apos; with a distinctly Eastern European flavor  VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS was a revelation for me, and I am very glad I went the extra mile to acquire a copy of it on VHS.\n\nThe narrative makes little sense and, like I said, it does not lead to anywhere in particular, but the film&apos;s trump card is the incredible (and often poetic) beauty of its images. The film ostensibly deals with the sexual awakening of a teenage girl, though the way director Jaromil Jires goes about this is extremely complex yet effortlessly captivating, and very enjoyable to boot. It takes in a variety of dazzling psycho-sexual concepts drawn from religion and mythological folklore which come off as both inextricably modern and deeply provocative still.\n\nThe film features a number of sexual perversions throughout, which is pretty amazing when considering that the lead actress was only 13 years old at the time (though nothing too explicit is ever shown): she is involved in lesbianism, incestuous/Oedipal familial relationships, and is even subjected to an attempted rape by a young priest  apart from being shown in various states of undress! In this way, it would seem to cater to the tastes of practically every broad-minded film-goer one can think of (be it art-house, horror or erotica), though it is arguable how well-known this film really is  which is a pity.\n\nThe few elements we find here of the traditional horror film are worth expanding upon, however: we get a number of vampires (the leading member bears an unmistakable resemblance to the Max Schreck of NOSFERATU [1922]) who periodically revert to their formerly more human and youthful selves, if only to further disorientate Valerie and ensnare her in their volatile and greedy schemes. Finally we &apos;witness&apos; Valerie being burned alive at the stake (as a witch), a punishment instigated by the same priest who had earlier seduced her. Still, she manages to emerge unscathed from her every crisis, thanks to a special talisman (in the shape of a pair of earrings) and the help of her goofy but devoted brother/lover, who goes by the name of Eagle!\n\nJaroslava Schallerova, who plays Valerie, is lovely and utterly charming throughout, striking a perfect balance between wide-eyed innocence and a curious sexual urge. Photography, sets, costumes and make-up are all wonderful (if obviously done on a low budget) - and the accompanying choral music is beautiful indeed, almost ethereal.\n\nThe by-now deleted Redemption PAL tape presented the film in a full-screen format (I&apos;m not sure if this is the correct ratio or not); the print was far from pristine but perfectly acceptable for an obscure item such as this. I wonder who owns the U.S. rights, as I would love to see it get a much-deserved renaissance on DVD.\n\nI cannot say whether VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS was actually a one-off for this Czech film-maker, as I know very little about his other work. The only Jaromil Jires film available anywhere at the moment is THE JOKE (1969), by way of a reportedly substandard edition from Facets Video on VHS and DVD."

Thanks to a lot of alcohol and the influence of the embittered, flag-waving leader of trio (Rod Steiger), what starts out as a mere &quot;generation gap&quot; political disagreement, quickly escalates into a violent, armed conflict.\n\nRod Steiger is excellent as the vicious leader of the veterans whose blind patriotism and narrow-minded prejudices leave almost everyone in the cast dead by the end. His more weak-willed friends are only along for the ride at first, but they too are quickly caught up in the escalating violence. And adding no small amount of fuel to the fire is Robin Mattson, as the Huffman character&apos;s sexy girlfriend. Playing an only slightly more sympathetic variation on the malicious tease she played in her most famous film &quot;Bonnie&apos;s Kids&quot;, her character takes her showers outdoors, even with all the drunken, dirty old men lingering about, and when she catches Steiger staring at her bra-less chest, she tauntingly lifts up her shirt to give him a better look at her yummy breasts. This is not to say she deserves what happens to her--the tragedy here is that all the characters are actually sympathetic to SOME extent, even if only Huffman approaches ever really being too likable.\n\nWith several gun battles, a gang rape, a wilderness chase, and lots of explosions, this works pretty well as a violent action movie. But it is one of those dark, cynical 70&apos;s ones like &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Southern Comfort&quot;, or &quot;Who&apos;ll Stop the Rain?&quot; that show only the ultimate futility and stupidity of violence. Definitely recommended, especially to fans of Rod Steiger, Robin Mattson, and/or downbeat 70&apos;s-era action fare."

      "reviewBody": "This adaptation of Charles Dickens&apos; famous unfinished novel is made in the style of Universal&apos;s horror films: in fact, it not only features many of their participants (from both sides of the camera) but actually shares several sets with BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) –making the film all that more enjoyable and fascinating a viewing! The stunning opening sequence, depicting an opium-induced hallucination, is followed by the shocking discovery of the addict involved (Claude Rains) to be the choirmaster of the local church! Jealously in love with a girl (Heather Angel) about to marry his nephew (David Manners in the title role), he schemes to get the boy out of the way – unaware that the couple had mutually given each other up when she falls for hot-tempered newcomer Douglass Montgomery; the latter&apos;s own shaky relationship with Drood leads to his being suspected of foul play when Manners goes missing – a situation Rains encourages for obvious reasons. Montgomery, however, does not rest on his laurels – indeed, he makes himself up as an old man in order to conduct his own private investigation! The exciting climax – set inside the crypt so memorably utilized in the James Whale masterpiece I mentioned earlier – sees the villain engaged in a scuffle with the hero, eventually getting his just desserts in melodramatic fashion. The film, then, serves as an interesting companion piece to contemporaneous Dickensian adaptations (a star-studded David COPPERFIELD emerged from MGM that same year) and should also pique the interest of horror buffs for the reasons I delineated at the start",

It&apos;s more like playing off of it with a set storyline about a group so fascinated and intrigued by the original Blair Witch movie, they all decide to go search for it. That is until they find something worse than the Blair Witch.\n\nThe twist to the story is unexpected and the acting is pretty tolerable for a movie like this. As a matter of fact, i&apos;d say the acting is pretty damn good for a horror movie.\n\nThis movie is one of my favorite movies to watch during Halloween. I saw it when it first came out and was surprised how good it actually was.\n\nPeople expecting to see some top notch production, direction, acting, plot, storyline, etc is going to be let down big time because that it is not. It&apos;s a simple horror movie playing off another that was hyped up with it&apos;s own story. That&apos;s it.\n\nJust go in with no expectations and intentions to enjoy a horror movie. You will enjoy it."

The film was slow, but acting was good, and the depiction of a mining community in the 50&apos;s fairly realistic.\n\nHelena B.C. looked commonplace without the heavy makeup required for most of her roles in the likes of &apos;Room With A View&apos;, and looked natural and well-fitted for her role. The background music was well chosen, and very becoming of the stage it set, as was the scenery.\n\nOverall, this film is a small gem. Too bad it has been little known and not promoted properly.",

      "reviewBody": "Aside from a modestly effective twist near the end of the movie regarding the real identity of the child &quot;Adam,&quot; this was a bland movie pretty much the whole way through. &quot;Adam&quot; applies to two characters, actually. The first being the child killed in a car accident near the beginning of the movie, and the second being his &quot;replacement.&quot; After the first Adam&apos;s death, his parents are approached by a famous doctor (played by Robert De Niro in one of his more forgettable performances) who offers to use the knowledge that he&apos;s gained through laboratory experiments to clone Adam. The result is pretty much what you&apos;d expect in this kind of movie. The new Adam seems to have memories of his previous life and seems from the beginning just a little &quot;off.&quot; You realize that there&apos;s more going on here than meets the eye - the figure of Zachary (the boy in Adam&apos;s dreams) really doesn&apos;t seem to connect with the story, but to me the disconnect was so great that I settled for remaining confused rather than even trying to connect Zachary with anything. The movie tries to frighten with assorted chills, but never really succeeds in that regard. The twist (as I mentioned above) is modestly effective (I hadn&apos;t seen it coming) but everything that came before was so bland that I really didn&apos;t care by the time the twist came out. The ending was too open ended - there were at least two possibilities left open for continuing the story in a sequel that just seemed too wide open. Fortunately, the sequel never came. I&apos;d have appreciated a bit more closure to this.\n\nThis is a mediocre movie at best. I always give a bit of extra credit for a twist that catches me off guard, but it&apos;s still mediocre.",

The beginning when Kitano and his matching dummy (who trade places throughout the film, whenever Kitano feels pressured or uncomfortable) think of new films to make Kitano a success.\n\nThey try gangster movies, because they are what Kitano is best at, but he has done too many of them and wants to get away from being typecast. Then they try a &quot;traditionally Japanese Ozu like film- the kind Wim Wenders would like&quot;, but it too falls through &quot;who wants to waste a half hour on drinking liquor and tea?&quot; Stories about the &quot;common folk&quot; aren&apos;t common anymore, and the black and white is now just alienating. They go through a few romances first where a woman is devoted to a man who is usually an artist or in some way disabled and these are called romantic comedies. Then they decide this is sexist so they try films where a man is devoted to a woman, and they call these tragedies. Martial arts period films and horror films get their turns as well, since both do well in foreign markets and might even get remade, but horror gives way to comedy, and neither make nearly enough at the box office.\n\nAll of these failures are visually punctuated by the suicide/murders of the Kitano shaped doll.Then providence strikes and Kitano knows what to do, he will make a big budget CGI sci-fi spectacle about meteors racing to earth, only the meteors will have faces and are supposed to become major characters in the film. After that reason abandons ship altogether and the last 45 minutes to an hour are the worlds longest Monty Python sketch involving Kitano as the assistant to a mad scientist/industrialist, and a mother and daughter trying to make cash the easy way, by putting roaches in their food at restaurants, getting hit by cars, and finally marrying Kitano. Trips to France, pro-wrestlers, villagers hopping like bunnies, robots, and generally inexplicable events follow one after the other until the credits.\n\nIn Godard like fashion even the characters seem out of place in this slapdash world, asking about why certain earlier strange things happened, at which point Kitano transforms into the wooden doll version of himself (if only we could all do this to get out of tough questions.)I laughed a few times, mostly out of surprise, but sometimes out of exhaustion. There&apos;s an early scene where Kitano tries to make a drama about the 50&apos;s, but fails once he realizes Japan in the 50&apos;s was the wrong place at the right time.\n\nThe nostalgic and innocent decade of American pop, was there a time of &quot;discrimination, poverty, and domestic abuse&quot;. It was also when Kitano grew up, moments which begin with promise of sentiment or catharsis segue into reminders of social horror at every turn.I don&apos;t think he necessarily intended this scene to be the &quot;heart&quot; of the film, and not just another spoof scenario, but it goes longer than most of the others, and after seeing it, and the conceptual loops, dead ends, and false starts. The film maker goes through for sake of &quot;glory&quot; it&apos;s easy to understand how it might be tempting to just turn into a block of wood, and let your Id make the decisions (the caricature is at least indestructible).\n\nEasier but not necessarily always entertaining to watch. Kitano did in fairness get his start as a stand-up comedian in the Manzai style (think fast past Abbot and Costello back and forth banter, which in Japan goes back to the 700&apos;s.), and many sequences like the martial arts instructor and his master, or the exploits of the strange stuffed animal ladies do take on the format of a Manzai routine. With a little cultural perspective the madness does have a method.Though considering the great ode to artistic impotence &quot;8 1/2&quot; has now become a star studded Hollywood musical in &quot;Nine&quot;, it&apos;s easy to understand Kitano&apos;s frustrations with the cinematic redundancy and the bastardized genre permutations that they spawn.",

      "reviewBody": "I seldom review &apos;fairy tales&apos; because of their speculative nature. Such tales usually take me to an imaginary world for an hour or two and when their effect fizzles out, I realize that it didn&apos;t work on me as it should have. However, this isn&apos;t the case with &apos;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&apos; released in the year 1979 or 1980. It was a collaborative effort between India and USSR. It was a film directed jointly by Umesh Mehra and Latif Faiziev. The duo would also direct &apos;Sohni Mahiwal&apos; in 1984, yet another milestone with evergreen songs. Since &apos;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&apos; is a 3 hour film, we would better look at the characters and their parts in this film.\n\n1. Fatima (Zeenat Aman): She is the daughter of an old and rich merchant (Madan Puri), who is not only a businessman but also the inventor of explosives! When his caravan is raided by 40 thieves, headed by the dreaded Abu Hassan (Rolan Bykov), Madan Puri and his aides try to stop them with explosives. Successful to some extent, the aides finally break down under the might of Abu Hassan, who takes Fatima and his dad captive and confines them both in an underground cave. Madan Puri is forced to make explosives for the thieves and Fatima is given charge to arrange stuffs for making bombs. In course of time, Fatima discovers that her dad committed suicide and is left all alone to avenge his death. With the help of Alibaba (Dharmendra) she finally manages to grab Abu Hassan.\n\n2. Alibaba aka Ali Bin Yusuf (Dharmendra): He is a resident of Gulabad (a fictional town located in a fictional Islamic State of Baharistaan) and a wastrel. He loves to spend time with his beloved friend Hamid. Alibaba is concerned about the wellness of Gulabad and wants to serve the people of his community. Time takes turn when Alibaba&apos;s mother (Sofiko Chiaureli) asks him to look for his father Yusuf, who is a trader but hasn&apos;t returned to Gulabad in the last 40 years. Alibaba&apos;s journey takes him to Baharistaan where he finds that the current ruler Shah Alam Parvez (Pinchoo Kapoor) has been deposed and killed by his commander-in-chief Shamsher (Prem Chopra). Alibaba rescues princess Marjina (Hema Malini) killing Shamsher in the process and they both join a caravan that&apos;s heading to Gulabad. He meets his long lost dad Yusuf in the caravan, but the happiness is short lived when Abu Hassan and his men attack the caravan and Yusuf is fatally wounded. Ali vows to slay Abu Hassan and his men, not really knowing that Abu Hassan is mightier than what people have ever known about him.\n\n3. Qasim (Zakir Mukhamedzhanov): He is Alibaba&apos;s elder brother. He is an industrious businessman and runs a store in Gulabad. His greed takes him to Abu Hassan&apos;s hideout, where he enters using the magical spell (Khul Jaa Sim Sim) but forgets it at the time he&apos;s about to leave. Abu Hassan and his henchmen discover Qasim hiding under the pile of dimes and quarter him. His corpse is hung inside the cave but Alibaba recovers it and gets it sewn by an experienced tailor.\n\n4. Marjina (Hema Malini): She is the daughter of Shah Alam Parvez and the princess of Gulabad. First Alibaba rescues her from Shamsher and then from a lecherous merchant Mustafa (Frunze Mkrtchyan) when he is about to sell her in the slave market. Marjina becomes Alibaba&apos;s trusted friend and lover and helps him in devising a plan to track Abu Hassan down.\n\n5. Abu Hassan (Rolan Bykov): Abu Hassan is the dreaded chief of 40 thieves. He is cruel, mean, cunning, courageous and a great actor. When I say actor, I really mean it. Rolan Bykov needs a standing ovation for his part. He has literally lived the character of Abu Hassan on screen. He portrays two different characters in the movie, who are not only one and the same but also exactly opposite. Either ways, he has justified his part and plays it fairly well. His dialogs are menacing, his humors are vengeful, his personality, his turban, his eyes, his looks and everything about him is sinister and the manner he magically transforms from one character to another is miraculous. The way he scolds his henchmen and makes them run like rats tells a lot about Abu Hassan&apos;s excellent commanding persona. I am so much in love with this man. He has sidelined all the other actors and meets success in making a special place in the viewer&apos;s mind.\n\nEven though &apos;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&apos; has considerable differences from the actual &apos;1001 Arabian Nights&apos; yet it is no boring and is capable enough to take the viewers in the old Arabian world where Merchants, Caravan Raiders, Magicians, Qaazis, Haakims and such unique figures used to exist. The part of Abu Hassan has been well handled. The original &apos;1001 Arabian Nights&apos; doesn&apos;t have Abu Hassan in it, but here Mehra and Faiziev introduced him and thanks that they did. This is indeed a fine example of classic cinema and the lovers of classic cinema would appreciate it. I also appreciate Javed Siddiqui for penning down dialogs that are in simple Urdu (unlike Razia Sultan, Mughal-e-Azam, Sikandar-e-Azam and some others) and it is also 100 times better than other films with Arabian backdrop like Ravikant Nagaich&apos;s &apos;Thief of Baghdad-1977&apos; and &apos;Shabnam - 1964&apos;. The songs are fresh and soothing. Overall, a complete family entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Although lower-tier Hollywood mogul Hal Roach is deservedly best-known today for nurturing many legendary comedians over the years (especially the greatest comic duo in film history, Laurel and Hardy), his production company also made other types of movies  with the TOPPER movies (2 of which I have recently watched) and the celebrated original version of OF MICE AND MEN (1939; which I have just acquired) being arguably their best &apos;extracurricular&apos; ventures. To a much lesser degree, Roach was a director himself and the well-crafted and, in hindsight, unjustly forgotten adventure film CAPTAIN FURY is perhaps his finest personal effort; for the record, I have recently also come across the prestigious prehistoric epic ONE MILLION B.C. (1940; starring Victor Mature and Lon Chaney Jnr.) and, on account of my positive experience with the film under review, plan to check it out presently. Anyway, CAPTAIN FURY may not strictly be swashbuckling fare but it is clear that Roach was following the classic Robin Hood/Zorro templates in this story of the titular Irish rebel (Brian Aherne) exiled to an Australian penal colony headed by a brutish landowner (George Zucco) who is also harassing the nearby settlers. Bonding with the fellow inmates  particularly incorrigible, thuggish thief Victor McLaglen and a sickly philosopher John Carradine  Aherne soon escapes to rouse the settlers against their oppressor. The excellent cast rounded up for this action-packed and amiable romp (that, for a 70-year old movie, features at least one extraordinary stunt involving a horse leaping down a waterfall!) is completed by the familiar faces of top-notch character actors like Paul Lukas (as a religious fanatic initially opposed to Aherne for setting sights on his daughter), Douglas Dumbrille (as Zucco&apos;s henchman), Charles Middleton, Claud Allister, Lumsden Hare, Mary Gordon, Edgar Norton, Billy Bevan, etc. Like the film itself, Aherne is a largely forgotten actor nowadays  despite having portrayed the legendary figure of King Arthur twice on screen in PRINCE VALIANT (1954) and LANCELOT AND GUINEVERE aka SWORD OF LANCELOT (1963)  but, seeing him cutting such a dashing figure here in the Errol Flynn mould, made me want to check out more of his workand, indeed, his Oscar-nominated turn as Emperor Maximilian in William Dieterle&apos;s star-studded biopic JUAREZ (released just one month prior to CAPTAIN FURY) should be just around the corner! It is always so refreshing to take these nostalgic trips to the lightweight entertainment Hollywood provided during its Golden Age and, as in previous occasions, I have the former sexton friend (and renowned film buff) to thank for introducing me to this rare gem via his personal (and understandably hazy) 16mm print.",

For me, the whole experience of naively stumbling into one&apos;s sexuality is accurately portrayed.  If you go in expecting that you will see a &quot;Hollywood&quot; ending--one that neatly ties up all the loose ends of the character&apos;s life--then you will be disappointed.  This film is about a &quot;chapter&quot; in the journey of one young woman&apos;s life.  And it&apos;s a fine chapter."

      "reviewBody": "OMG! I just saw this and...don&apos;t! It was soooo boring. It was NOTHING like the first movie. I know the director said it wasn&apos;t a sequel, but still, it was not good. A big problem was the title. It&apos;s called Monster: The Dark Continent. The dark continent is what Africa&apos;s known as. However, this movie seemed more like a film about the Iraq war with the monsters as a very distant backdrop. Granted, they didn&apos;t say they were in Iraq. I don&apos;t actually recall them saying where the film took place.\n\nSome said the acting was bad. I didn&apos;t have a problem with the acting. The cinematography was good. I just expected something VERY different.\n\nSome of the monsters were like galloping antelope. Others were like birds. Some seemed like walking trees. The point is, they didn&apos;t come across as any sort of a threat. As I said, boring.\n\nI gave this a 4-star rating. I do not recommend. Watch the first one, and look at that as a one-story movie. This one didn&apos;t do anything but bore me to tears. Now I&apos;m really tired. When I feel like going to sleep after watching a movie -- in the early evening -- that&apos;s how I can tell a movie sucked.",

If this had been shot like many docs (with the usual banal techniques for hiding participants&apos; identities), I doubt it could have presented the human side of these stories as effectively or as respectfully."

The story I used to read many times over is something I was always curious about how they&apos;d put it on celluloid... khmmm... coulda been far better... I think the main problem is that it lacks any real background to the main characters, their &apos;previos life&apos; their place in the micro-society of the typical rural France countryside. \n\nA spicy choice of brilliant actors (Trintignant as Fulbert, Serrault the Squire and Villeret as Momo) should&apos;ve been given MUCH more credit than this. I just don&apos;t know why this movie went awry - looooong, boring and leaving holes unanswered in the story - maybe it was only intended to be a cheapo TV-film, poorly budgeted variant. If you see the movie first you&apos;ll never want to read the book, if you read the book first you&apos;d be disappointed by the movie.",

I was in college and saw it as part of a double feature (with Promise Her Anything - talk about a weird pairing). I liked the movie even though it wasn&apos;t really very good.\n\nIt has been almost 40 years since I saw it so I really can&apos;t remember all the plot but basically it was an updating of the biblical story of Judith. The time period is after WWII and prior to the start of Israel. Judith (Loren) is a displaced refugee who is smuggled to Palestine in a crate via boat. She emerges (FULLY made-up and drop dead beautiful)) from the crate and the plot thickens (or maybe curdles is a better word).Seems her (ex ?) husband is a Nazi, now living in Damascus, wanted by the Israelis. sSo ....\n\nI knew it was stupid (even in my early 20&apos;s) but just watching Sophia was enough. The production values seemed good. I even bought the soundtrack. As I said, I&apos;d buy a DVD or tape copy ....\n\nWHD",

      "reviewBody": "HURRICANE is not a great film, but it sure IS entertaining. Some of the scenes and situations are ludicrous (Jason Robards has the hots for his daughter, Mia Farrow) and the dialogue is often hilarious. But if you stick around, you&apos;ll find that the production values are astonishing. Among the talents behind the camera are Jan Troell (THE EMIGRANTS, THE NEW LAND), who directed; Sven Nykvist (cinematographer for many of Ingmar Berman&apos;s later films) who filmed on location in the South Pacific; and Nino Rota, who wrote a lovely, haunting musical theme. The performances aren&apos;t so bad (considering the dialogue) and the special effects at the end show you why this was one of the most expensive films of its day.",

It features interviews with the inmates, the guards, and even the warden. It looks like one tough existence in there, and the prisoners will probably have a hard time reintegrating into society once they get out.\n\nThe documentary mentions that the US leads the world in incarceration. At the time, the prison population was 1.5 million; now it&apos;s over 2 million, most of them black and Latino. The documentary also mentions the sentencing reform that caused the prison population to swell. I suspect that the things experienced by the inmates in Lewisburg - including the plumbing issue - happen in prisons all over the US.\n\nThe basic point of the documentary is that these men are human beings, and their mistakes sent them to this hellhole. Indeed, it&apos;s the so-called War on Drugs* has disproportionately targeted non-white people and devastated entire communities. As long as we have these regressive laws, the prisons will almost certainly remain filled.\n\n*One of Nixon&apos;s cabinet members later admitted that the purpose of the War on Drugs was to destroy both the anti-war movement and the Black Power movement.",

Not only is it a gentle movie but for a major part, it falls into the conventional and leads to the inevitable &quot;happy-end&quot;. When Martin, the little boy is sliding away to take refuge in a big but frightening house, at first he&apos;s scared because this house is supposed to be haunted by a wicked man (Jacques Perrin). Martin will realize that this man is nice and he had an unhappy life. He&apos;ll even be the one to find a way so as to solve the problem of an enormous tree fought between Martin&apos;s friends and a rival group.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s too obvious that this movie is only aimed at children",

      "reviewBody": "This is a feature-length remake of the 1910 Silent one-reeler I recently watched about this same historical figure or, rather, it deals more elaborately with the events with which she (and her more famous spouse, Giuseppe) was involved. Incidentally, I was unaware of the film before being broadcast as a matinée&apos; on Italian TV on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy. The film also happened to mark the unofficial debut of co-director Rosi, later a major exponent of comparable political themes: he was engaged after star/producer/uncredited writer Anna Magnani quarreled with original helmer Alessandrini (a veteran of large-scale, if old-school, productions like ABUNA MESSIAS {1939} and his masterpiece, the two-parter WE, THE LIVING {1942}).\n\nMagnani managed to recruit an impressive supporting cast – headed by Raf Vallone obviously playing her husband in a younger and more handsome guise than he is usually depicted! Incidentally, the film was a co-production between Italy and France, so that a number of actors from the latter country were given prominent roles – notably Alain Cuny as Garibaldi&apos;s lieutenant (who later begins to have doubts with respect to their cause but is soon back on patriotic track), Jacques Sernas as a young member of the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; (as the 4,000-strong rebel outfit was known) who no sooner has he recovered from a war wound that he is ready to take up arms once more, and Serge Reggiani as a layabout who becomes the subtle dissenting voice within the group and is eventually revealed to have been in the enemy&apos;s pay all along (of course, he will get his just desserts – in a surprisingly noir-like mood and one of the film&apos;s best scenes – long before the end)! \n\nAs for the star, she is surprisingly restrained here – though this has to do with the fact that the character is sick through much of the proceedings (spending virtually the entire last act pining for water!) more than anything else. However, her portrayal is undeniably forceful, and she is still vociferous when the need arises (usually to hold the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; together during periods of particular strife or while her husband is occupied elsewhere)! Incidentally, while her death in this version occurs in the home of a supporter, in the earlier short she expires in a remote hut while fleeing the enemy.\n\nAnyway, while there is little action per se, the hardships of battle and the constant marching to elude detection are evident on each weather-beaten face (among the members of Garibaldi&apos;s band of soldiers are a stout father and his spirited teenage son, both of whom eventually end up before the firing squad!). Unfortunately, the copy I watched suffered from a constant (but thankfully not too distracting) audio glitch where all the background noise came off as &apos;processed&apos;.",

This movie has plenty John Woo-style actionscenes that will please any old fan of Hongkong-actionfilms, and the acting and story is also good.  As in all actionfilms from Hongkong, the theme is brotherhood, friendship, betrayal and vengeance. A superb movie that surpasses the original movie in every way, but be sure to watch the original &quot;God Of Gamblers&quot; before you see this. 9/10"

      "reviewBody": "The late film director Robert Clouse showed himself to be fairly versatile when it came to his projects. After having already made one bonafide classic with the martial arts actioner &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and the similarly fun &quot;Black Belt Jones&quot;, he went on to do the futuristic sci-fi saga &quot;The Ultimate Warrior&quot;. Here he tackles the &quot;nature strikes back&quot; sub genre with very enjoyable results.\n\nIt takes place on a resort island where the year round residents, and some visitors, now have to deal with the problem of a ferocious dog pack that is the result of vacationers having adopted these dogs for the summer and then abandoned them. Yeah, there&apos;s a real message in here about mankinds&apos; callousness towards his fellow animals that gives this movie some appreciated (and not overdone) subtext in addition to its thrills.\n\nThere&apos;s no filler here, just a good, straightforward story (based on a novel by David Fisher) that moves forward at a decent pace. The rural scenery is, not unexpectedly, very nicely photographed and the booming music by Lee Holdridge is perfect accompaniment. The animal action is first rate - the principal trainer is Karl Lewis Miller, an old hand at that kind of thing for many years, and he gets utterly convincing performances from the canine stars, especially the primary antagonist, a mangy mongrel, and the pathetic straggler of the group whom we see abandoned near the beginning of the movie.\n\nThe human cast does not fare badly, either, with the ever solid Joe Don Baker, playing a marine biologist (!), as the kind of hero you can root for. (Of course, there are also the standard characters in this thing whom you pretty much *hope* are going to come to a bad end.) Hope Alexander-Willis is his appealing leading lady, and the supporting cast features such reliable performers as Richard B. Shull and R. G. Armstrong.\n\n&quot;The Pack&quot; never gets too graphic, preferring to leave some things to the imagination, but doesn&apos;t skimp on the thrills, being genuinely exciting at times, especially in the last half hour. Overall it&apos;s more effective than the movie &quot;Dogs&quot; which was also released in that busy period, post-&quot;Jaws&quot;, when a number of movies like this were coming out. It&apos;s entertaining all the way; that final sequence will just melt your heart.\n\nClouse returned to animal horror five years later with &quot;The Rats&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Deadly Eyes&quot;.\n\nEight out of 10.",

I accepted such for what it was - without any hope of redemption, rehabilitation or remorse! The problem with the film is that since the character soon becomes so one dimensional, the scenes just flow as episode after episode in a manner, way, etc., that makes one long for some personal epiphany, crisis, etc. This flick would have played well as tongue-in-cheek biography with a heavy dose of comedy, much like the films about; e.g., Ed Wood, Larry Flynt, etc. The movie might have been bettor with some modest introduction to the lead character, allowing some empathy.",

U., which is odd, because the Bolsheviks killed her family, and she is out for revenge. Will Quadflieg is a student, driving a truck part-time, whom the O. G. P. U get to work for them, by blackmailing him, then blackmailing him again.\n\nSome of these things will be explained by the end of this movie, but not all of them. It&apos;s directed byKarl Ritter, who has a very poor reputation as making propagandistic, wordy potboilers. Well, this one is very propagandistic -- Germany having invaded Russia, it was time to make it clear that they were bad, bad people -- but that&apos;s the script that was handed to him. In terms of moviemaking with a bad script, it&apos;s pretty well done, with lots of moving shots, location shooting in Paris, some interesting Dutch angles, and the editing is top notch, with a nice montage of locations in France and the Low Countries by Ritter&apos;s regular editor, Conrad von Molo. Judging by this film, and the two other films from Ritter that I have seen, I would suggest that the low opinion that critics like Karsten Witte have is based on the intellectual content of his films, rather than his abilities to make one that, once you strip out the egregious propaganda, is engaging.\n\nWhat&apos;s that? Ritter was also the producer and the writer?",

      "reviewBody": "Eye of the Needle is an oddly structured but nonetheless extremely effective film which in many ways is quite old fashioned in tone and feel,with the addition of a little &apos;modern&apos;sex and violence. For almost the first half,the film is a fairly conventional but quite gripping spy thriller,as a German agent causes havoc in World War 2 England. There are few surprises,but Donald Sutherland is mesmerising to watch {even if his accent wavers} and the plot at least sounds almost plausible. The keen eyed,however,may spot mistakes in the period detail.\n\nThen Sutherland is washed up on a Scottish island inhabited by a crippled man and his frustrated wife,and the film changes into an incredibly tense mixture of romance and thrills. Sutherland and Nelligan&apos;s affair may be basically sexual,but there is real chemistry between them and a real sense of desperation,of two lonely people throwing themselves together. The last half hour is real edge-of-the-seat stuff,perhaps almost bordering on psycho-thriller,but it really works.\n\nThroughout the film Sutherland remains the villain and does do some nasty things,but it&apos;s a measure of his performance that occasionally we do come close to sympathising with him. Acting-wise though the film really belongs to Nelligan,a tragically underused and beautiful actress who has to go through the motions of loneliness and frustration,than lust,then fear,and eventually heroism,and does so superbly.\n\nAided tremendously by the last ever score from the legendary film composer Miklos Rozsa,who provides a moving love theme and some especially thrilling music for the last section of the film,Eye of the Needle perhaps shouldn&apos;t really work as well at it does,but that&apos;s a measure of it&apos;s quality."

      "reviewBody": "To read through most reviews of Balthazar feels like having stepped inside a church with people sighing about god and transcendence, which is a testament to Bresson&apos;s power here in his most spiritual work so far. But let me step outside in clear air for a moment.\n\nIt was an ongoing project for him, striving for an ascetic eye that purifies. He had began (essentially) with Diary of a Priest, ambitious work about a spiritual journey. But I believe he was troubled by a few things in it, if his next films offer any clue.\n\nHe spent the next couple of films completely muting the emotional turmoil evident in Diary, taking all the romanticism out, making them purely about the desire to break free from a prison-world. Pickpocket and Jeanne D&apos;Arc were sketches in that austere direction. But this was setting him down a disastrous path where the only thing purer was was just more and more bare. When does fasting become starving and why is a stone floor purer than a furnished house? \n\nHow about we say that his desire to evoke the abstract was laudable, but his dogmatic way of doing it absolutely killed the world in which it lives and hides? His camera murders it. It only managed to take the pure out of life and make a liturgy around its dead body. It was destroying the possibility for cinematic space to support metaphor, inner life, poetry, and to simply be anything other than dead nature. The process of facts alone won&apos;t do, they can never convey life, much less pure life. \n\nSo I had my sights set on Balthazar as his most pure, most lauded, and expected perhaps to mount a critique of a spirituality that is only its own funeral. But I believe he beat me to the punch. I believe he began to see that he was starving himself, at least so far as the film is different from before.\n\nThis is his most lush, his most ambitious since Diary (none of the interim were), his most accomplished and with the most life. His camera doesn&apos;t just stare, it moves again and searches. He doesn&apos;t just create ellipsis within a scene, he makes it move across the narrative. \n\nA household collapses, but we move to see this in the girl&apos;s disastrous relationship with a despicable bully, and we experience the loss of innocence, the fouling of kindness in her world, in Balthazar&apos;s treatment at the hands of several callous owners.\n\nAt the center Bresson has the most placid, most unassuming actor, a selfless being. It&apos;s by reading what we do in Balthazar&apos;s eyes that we color the whole and it ripples through and becomes ours. We have the reactions he doesn&apos;t and thus humanize ourselves. It&apos;s marvelous and it plumbs into something fundamental about how the world is put together that makes it worthy beyond technique.\n\nSee, life will break down, sometimes for no other reason than someone changed his mind about a deal and pride. It will break and scatter in pieces, go through the cycle of suffering. The film ends with everything broken, nothing put back together, the girl having left off for a next life somewhere.\n\nWhat it plumbs is that what we see into these makes a difference. There&apos;s abandonment at the end, heartbreak, anonymous loss of a soul that we knew as dear. But I would rather see courage myself. Instead of projecting our human terror into him, take from his capacity to endure. If suffering isn&apos;t pain, it&apos;s not being able to abide pain; how about there is nothing lost, nothing broken, there is only a time for things to come together and a time to disperse again? Balthazar isn&apos;t lost, he has returned, or so it goes maybe."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Murder Clinic&quot; (1966) is a fairly obscure Italian-French Gothic that first aired on Pittsburgh&apos;s Chiller Theater in 1979, and repeated only once four years later. It was also part of a notorious triple bill that frequented drive ins in the early 70&apos;s (under the name REVENGE OF THE LIVING DEAD), shown with CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (Mario Bava&apos;s KILL, BABY, KILL!) and FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD (Amando De Ossorio&apos;s MALENKA, NIECE OF THE VAMPIRE). The print I have runs 83 minutes and looks to be a third generation copy, with English dialogue and foreign subtitles. William Berger, later the star of Mario Bava&apos;s &quot;5 Dolls for an August Moon&quot; (1970), plays the handsome doctor working on skin grafts that all the women swoon over, with a jealous invalid for a wife, and a mysterious woman on the third floor who refuses to see or be seen by anyone. Murder by razor plagues the clinic, but only one victim is completely innocent of her fate. Nothing terribly memorable, but fondly recalled in the 30 years since. The blonde actress who plays the nurse Mary is not the same brunette Barbara Wilson who appeared in 1957&apos;s &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot; and 1962&apos;s &quot;The Flesh Eaters.&quot;",

The two leads, Gere and Basinger, do a solid but routine job in their roles; it&apos;s the secondary characters who give this film a life of its own: Eric Roberts (an outstanding performance) as the edgy husband, Uma Thurman as the patient (whose character is the only one who remains an enigma right to the end), the detective who keeps making insinuations, Gere&apos;s colleague who gets panicky when he has to testify, etc. If nothing else, Joanou shows a talent for allowing his actors to do their stuff.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;High and Low&quot; is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. It&apos;s proof positive of Kurosawa&apos;s mastery of film and all its imagery.\n\nThe story was adapted from an Ed McBain &quot;87th Precinct&quot; novel, &quot;King&apos;s Ransom&quot;, and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur&apos;s son who was taken by mistake. Doesn&apos;t matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.\n\nThe second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.\n\nIt helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy.\n\n From the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot; and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.\n\nTo me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.\n\nTHIS is the movie Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;Ransom&quot; wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass.\n\nTen out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has very little in common with the first movie, the only real connection between the two is Chuck Norris is in both of them. That and the movie does involve the Delta Force once again. It is also a very unmemorable movie as there are very few scenes in this one that I can recall. While I remember the older movie Delta Force almost entirely and I did not exactly watch that one a whole lot more. One of the few scenes that I even remember is the scene involving the Delta Force doing a sky jump with the drug lord and the fact this film had a bit of a similar plot to the James Bond film &quot;License to Kill&quot;, however that film is superior to this one as I can remember a lot about that one too. I do not remember this one being particularly horrible or anything, I just remember it not being as good as the original and that I got a bit bored during this film, another thing that did not occur during the first film. In the end I think it is just one of those sequels that uses the success of the first film to try and market an almost unrelated film. Like this one was supposed to have Chuck in some sort of drug task force, but they thought they could get some more bucks by making it a sequel to the Delta Force movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I have seen MUCH worse Fu/ninja flicks then this but this one isn&apos;t very good either.\n\nKind of a ripoff of American Ninja, white guy learns Japanese style blah blah blah. Unlike the characters in that series of movies, some of the people in this actually do seem to know martial arts. Kind of a cross between a genuine fu flick like a Jet Li movie and typical American crap.\n\nThe rest of the plot is......ah who cares, its a samurai movie, doesn&apos;t matter. :P\n\nUnlike American Ninja this movie doesn&apos;t have 2 guys taking on dozens of &quot;ninja masters&quot; that can be knocked out with one punch, this has more of a realistic one on one style and it is a challenge for the combatants. Much like Blood Sport.\n\nWhat it does have going for it it the interesting fighters in the last 45 minutes of the movie, the first half of the movie is just filler to make an excuse for all of the fighting at the end so skip it.\n\nThe fighters at the end look like they were pulled straight from an early 90&apos;s 2D arcade fighting game. That is the high point of this flick.\n\nThe low point, and I mean VERY low point is the last fight scene. Both of the &quot;samurai&quot; are wearing the same black and white outfit, no other colors. If you look close during the last fight though you can clearly see red streamers coming from out of the frame, they reused footage from one of the earlier fight scenes to add length to the last fight and it looks SOOOOOOOO cheesy. Also the actors don&apos;t know  a damn thing about sword fighting, they just clang them together for 5 minutes, that coupled with the reused footage makes it a non-climax.\n\nSince 45 minutes of this movie is solid fighting with fighters that actually do know how to use their weapons, the very last scene isn&apos;t as important.\n\nYou can do worse then this, any American Ninja above 2 for example.\n\n Not really good or really terrible.\n\n5/10 when compared to other Fu/ninja movies, would score higher if the last fight scene was done well.",

His lover Belle Aragon (Annelle Hayes) owns a saloon with a brothel and has just proposed to marry him. However, Guthrie is summoned by the US Army Major Frazer (John McIntire) that sends a troop commanded by his friend First Lt. Jim Gary (Richard Widmark) to bring him to the Fort Grant.\n\nWhen Guthrie meets Major Frazer, he explains that the relatives of prisoners of the Comanche tribe are pressing the army to bring them back home, but the soldiers can not trespass the Indian lands due to a treat with the Comanche. The mercenary Guthrie demands a large amount to negotiate with Chief Quanah Parker (Henry Brandon) the freedom of the white captives. Guthrie travels with Lt. Jim Gary and they rescue the two last captives, a teenager that has been raised by the Comanche and a young woman, Elena de la Madriaga (Linda Cristal), who has been the woman of the leader of the Buffalo Shields Stone Calf (Woody Strode) for five years. Once in the white society, they are outcast by the &quot;civilized&quot; white society and their reintegration is almost impossible. \n\n&quot;Two Rode Together&quot; is another great western by John Ford, with a different story about the difficulty of reintegration of captives of Indians into the civilized society of the white man. The plot entwines comical and dramatic situations with powerful dialogs. James Stewart is fantastic, as usual, performing an unethical greedy man that changes his behavior after meeting Elena, performed by the gorgeous Linda Cristal. Both characters find redemption in the end. Richard Widmark shows a magnificent chemistry with James Stewart and Shirley Jones. In the end, it is hard to point out the civilized and uncivilized societies. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Terra Bruta&quot; (&quot;Raw Land&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Admitedly this film is somewhat lacking in film techniques and complexity, but the reason for this is not that it is a bad film but rather a film with a different aim. With so many films coming out every year it is unavoidable that they be judged and compared, but this constant rating of films has created a certain stereotype of qualities which a film should have to be good. This kind of stereotyped rating, although often setting a good standard for comparison, works against films such as Sky Fighters. This is because in my opinion Sky Fighters has a different goal to most movies, rather than using the common methods to deliver a complex story line, Sky Fighters is a tribute to fighter pilots. It does an excellent job of portraying the complexity and importance of the role of a fighter pilot, as well as demonstrating the qualities a pilot must posses. Sky Fighters uses all real flying and aerobatics footage to achieve a very real demonstration, from the technical aspect, of what it means to be a fighter pilot. This film is very appropriate for anyone interested in fighters, aerobatics and the people behind them. I do not recommend it for audiences looking for a sophisticated or complex storyline.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 80&apos;s, after seeing his father and lumberjack foreman being hit by a protester against the deforesting and arrested by the police, the boy Gus kills the protester with a chainsaw. In the present days, Samantha (Jamie King), who is traumatized after being abused by her former boyfriend Jimmy (Balthazar Getty), travels with her pothead friends in a van to the American Free Love Festival, a rock-and-roll concert in the woods. Near the location, they are assaulted by three local hillbillies, but they succeed to arrive in the festival. Meanwhile, Mayor Hal Burton (Rick Overton) and Deputy Buzz Hall (Thomas Jane) try to give a minimum of organization to the event. However, a deranged psychopath serial-killer wearing a mask of Ronald Reagan uses an ax to kill the pacific stoned hippies.\n\nThe slasher &quot;The Tripper&quot; is a great disappointment. David Arquette certainly had the intention of making a cult-movie and was supported by a good cast (probably his friends) including a cameo appearance of his wife and a great cinematography and lightening, but unfortunately the story never works. Jason Mewes is comfortable performing his traditional role of pothead; the sexy Jaime King has a good performance in the role of Samantha but the good actor Thomas Jane is displaced in his silly role. Further, the political anti-war jokes and speeches of the Republicans and Ronald Reagan are boring. In a cheap manipulation, the Brazilian DVD highlights the name of Courtney Cox-Arquette in the movie, misleading her fans. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Perseguição Assassina&quot; (&quot;Assassin Pursue&quot;)",

But the problem here is the lack of motivation. We never learn who or why Roy Scheider had to be killed, and there are a number of assassination attempts. He works for intelligence, all right, but that is not enough. His boss seems to be Christopher Walken, who is expert on wicked roles, and he actually tells Scheider&apos;s wife&apos;s brother to kill him, but there is no motivation. The lack of any motivation here makes the film absurd in its forced effort to contrive a great action thriller, while nothing makes any sense. There is a girl who also eventually proves to have some desire to kill him because of some grandmother&apos;s trauma, which deviation from all sense and logic only adds to the nonsense of this ridiculous plot. Roy Scheider is always good and saves the film in many ways, but the only real value of the film is the fantastic score by Miklos Rosza, in collaboration with no one else than Bernard Herrmann, which adds to the film&apos;s character of being nothing else than a poor Hitchcock paraphrase.",

What can I say? Every time I rent a Lambert movie I&apos;m being disappointed. This film strikes the viewer through a lack of acting talent, bad filming, awful music and no suspense whatsoever. The story is flat, predictable and makes no sense. There is no explanation of why the South African businessmen is being hunted by a criminal, nor why this guy is in prison or why he is being released. How did Robert Nile get into contact with Laney, know where to find him? The film gives no explanation as for the basic framework of the story. Instead minutes and minutes of the movie are covered by shots of the countryside the car&apos;s driving through. It&apos;s a film that is hard to stand, even when viewed in fast forward mode.",

It starts out with the main character (XXXX) and narrator cheerfully extolling the virtues of the drug industry when you are careful and organised like he is. He is about to retire with a nice little fortune. Then it all starts to go wrong, one thing after another as layers are added to the plot.\n\nSometimes it seems as if the plot is too complex and there are two dangers, one of leaving the audience behind and two leaving gaping holes in the plot. Still the humour and action set pieces are enough to pull it through. It is not as good as Snatch or Lock, Stock etc but is original enough to stand on its own right. Worth a look.",

My favourite moment was when she performed &quot;Speecheless&quot;, &quot;You And I&quot; and &quot;Born This Way&quot;.\n\nLast year I was lucky enough to see Lady Gaga in concert and was most impressed with her. She went beyond what I expected and more than delivered, with a thrilling, engaging and highly enjoyable show! This HBO special was even better, a grand spectacle in line with Gaga&apos;s crazy universe, unmistakable talent, her sensuality and sexuality as well as vision and artistry! \n\nGreat job!",

      "reviewBody": "Prior to starring in the hard-edged 1983 drama Bad Boys, Sean Penn had proved his early promise in the TV movie The Killing of Randy Webster, played a memorable supporting role in Taps (with fellow newcomer Tom Cruise), and created the definitive California surfer dude as the perpetually stoned Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. But it was Bad Boys that cemented Penn&apos;s reputation as a rare talent--an actor whose skill transcended his youth, revealing a depth and maturity that the majority of his acting peers could only aspire to. That gravity and emotional dimension is evident throughout Penn&apos;s performance here as Mick O&apos;Brien, a chronic offender whose path to a Chicago juvenile corrections facility seems utterly preordained. The institution is hardly conducive to reformation--it&apos;s a jail for problem kids, and a cauldron for all the societal ills that sent kids there in the first place. Mick&apos;s there because he was involved in a shootout during a botched robbery of drugs from rival street gangster Paco Moreno (Esai Morales), whose little brother was killed when Mick accidentally ran him over with his getaway car. Overcrowding results in Mick and Paco&apos;s being sent to the same facility (one of the film&apos;s few stretches of credibility), and this leads to a rather predictable showdown that will take the jive prison&apos;s violence to its inevitable extreme. It&apos;s a shame this conclusion ultimately doesn&apos;t live up to the film&apos;s superior first hour, but Bad Boys remains a remarkably authentic, even touching portrait of troubled youth whose torment is conveyed through thoughtful and richly emotional development of characters. Director Rick Rosenthal (who had previously helmet Halloween II) maintains a vivid sense of setting within the correctional facility&apos;s cold walls, and through the performances of Penn and a superb supporting cast (including Ally Sheedy in her film debut as Mick&apos;s girlfriend), Bad Boys emerges as one of the best films of its kind, forcing the viewer to ask difficult questions about at-risk youth and the proper way to improve or at least preserve their endangered lives.",

No, it&apos;s not Citizen X and that&apos;s a good thing. Where Citizen X reads like a plodding police investigation, Evilenko comes across as a searing reading of a killer&apos;s personal hell. David Greico has written and directed a completely interesting and thorough examination of Evilenko&apos;s mind and motivations. While the killings are handled dispassionately, the victims aren&apos;t one dimensional, we feel for them but Grecio never sentimentalizes them. Definitely a cut above the average serial killer film.",

      "name": "Fantastic Work, Mr.  Smith!",
      "reviewBody": "So, a friend of mine won tickets to catch a screening of &quot;Red State&quot;  followed by a Q&amp;A session with Kevin Smith and the cast, which included  Melissa Leo, John Goodman, and more. The show was at the stunning Radio  City Music Hall, which felt strange considering the elegance of the  venue when pitted against the griminess of the film.   The film was wonderful. In Smith&apos;s own words, &quot;A nasty-ass little  horror flick with few (if any) likable characters&quot;. Three young men  encounter a cult-like church (modeled after the ever-so-famous Westboro  Baptist Church), whom they discover is up to more than simply  protesting funerals. That&apos;s about as much as you need to know.  This is easily Smith&apos;s best work to date. From a visual/directing  standpoint, the camera is so effectively used to capture the unsettling  tone. He makes an extensive use of the shaky-cam, which, but in more  creative ways that I&apos;ve seen in recent times. The shaking is definitely  more subtle than say &quot;the Bourne Identity&quot;, which adds just the perfect  amount of tension during dialogue heavy scenes, and just the right  intensity during the more violent ones. Both are which are in great  quantities. The quality of the picture was also very good (shot of Red  Cinema cameras).  The sound is also a high point of praise. The real charm of the movie  is its unsettling tone, which pervades throughout most of it. There is  no real score here, either. Every song you hear is within the film  itself, mostly sung by Michael Parks, the man playing the villainous  preacher. And speaking of him, I must say that his performance was  Oscar worthy. Absolutely terrifying.  The writing itself might be where my few criticisms lie. The film has  many twists, a few too many for my liking. These &quot;surprises&quot; impress a  lot of people, but to me, they come off as cheap and make the film feel  really inconsistent at times. Also, whereas the first half of the film  is a genuinely frightening horror film, the second half feels most like  an action/thriller. It was all very good, but only until the film nears  its conclusion does it really feel scary again. But, the writing is  also rather impressive. When I look back on it, nothing in the film  feels superfluous, it all flows and connects greatly. The opening few  scenes set the rest of the film up awesomely. And, of course, there&apos;s a  small dose of humor in it, much of it compliments of Mr. JOHN F-ING  GOODMAN. The Cast was all fantastic, but particularly Parks, Melissa  Leo, and John Goodman come off as shining stars here.  The Q&amp;A was fun, mostly because I got to see such awesome people in  person, but I never got to ask my question, and some of the questions  asked were so bad they got boo&apos;s all around from the rest of the  audience.  All in all, when Red State hits theaters this October, you really need  to see it. It&apos;s all around a wonderful piece of indie cinema, and will  satisfy horror-fans, and casual movie goers alike. My rating, 8/10.   I have every intention of seeing this again when it&apos;s actually  released.  P.S. Best Opening credit sequence ever!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Though The Man In the Iron Mask is swashbuckling adventure at its finest it&apos;s hardly an accurate picture of the times. But Alexander Dumas was no more writing history here than he was in The Three Musketeers which in many ways this is the further adventures of.\n\nTwin sons are born to Louis XIII and his wife Anne of Austria and in order to avoid dynastic rivalry, one of them is sent with the King&apos;s trusty right hand D&apos;Artagnan to raise in his native Gascony. The other becomes the well known Louis XIV and ascends to the throne as a child of six.\n\nWarren William is the aging, but still very capable D&apos;Artagnan. In his scenes especially the film bares more than a slight resemblance to the version that Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. did as his last silent film. I would not be surprised if a lot of stock footage was incorporated here by producer Edward Small and director James Whale.\n\nLouis Hayward essays the difficult dual role of both Louis XIV and his twin brother Phillip. Hayward&apos;s first big break came as Anita Louise&apos;s lover and Fredric March&apos;s father in Anthony Adverse where he lost a duel to Claude Rains. Hayward never lost too many screen duels after that though his swashbuckler parts that he mostly did after service in World War II never matched up to this.\n\nJoseph Schildkraut and Walter Kingsford are the evenly matched pair of ministers vying for preeminence as Fouquet and Colbert. Colbert did in fact triumph, but not in the way as shown here. And Fouquet was a guy who liked to live high on the hog. In real life that&apos;s what actually brought him down.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask is an often filmed tale here in America, I&apos;m sure the French have done many versions. For adventure and romance you can&apos;t beat it and this version is one of the best around.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was played in Greece within the context of the 13nth French-speaking Film Festival. It is a strange blend of genres, drama, documentary and certainly a film with an agenda. This last observation is the one that must be emphasized the most. What was &quot;The Triumph of the Will&quot; for Nazism is this film for Leftism. It loosely follows the itinerary of a girl of African origins which has reached Europe. She encounters the hostility of policemen and bureaucrats and through her adventures we watch events and mass rallies in Athens, Paris and Madrid. She is the sole person in the movie who can be described as the protagonist. All others appear briefly or participate in mass scenes in which they are indistinguishable from the crowd. The movie is interspersed with dicta and slogans against capitalism from the book of a French writer who is believed to have inspired this film. They are not particularly ingenious or bright but they stress the fact of exploitation. A poor girl is used as a paradigm and her personal story is used as a parable of the story of the wretched of the Earth-that is Thirld World immigrants as well as Roma people, who are the people the director belongs to. Inevitably your opinion of this particular movie will be very much conditioned by how much you agree or disagree with its politics. I think that it makes a powerful message for the cause it espouses although it is rather loosely structured.Surely it will mean different things to different people.",

There are no good suspenseful moments, there are no jump scares.\n\nThere is the mystery about the killer and a bit of unique fun with the possible effect saving someone might have. That earns it about a 5.5 rating.\n\nIf you were a teen in 2003 then the nostalgia might be enough to make it more enjoyable.\n\nIt never gets annoying enough to turn off but it also never gets good enough to make it really worth while.\n\nI know that they rarely use actual teenagers to play high school students but Summer often looked old enough to be playing someone&apos;s mom.",

      "reviewBody": "A friend borrowed this DVD from a library in farming country Saskatchewan. Now, I was raised on a farm in Southern Ontario, lost to the same Farm Creditor shenanigans portrayed in this movie, so I have great sympathy for the story line. BUT, if these two idiots drank as much as is portrayed throughout this movie, when they should have been working the farm, then no wonder they lost it.\n\nBut after too many minutes of gnawing my knuckles, hoping that the hokey acting would end, I know why I never heard of this movie Miles From Home before. And I hope I never hear of it again \n\nOkay, this movie killed time but I nearly died watching it (I am certain some rich movie reviewer has already copyrighted that line)...\n\nGod, I hope your evening was more entertaining take me out and shoot me a bunch of drunk farmers burning down farms because of Farm Creditors? Could have been a good movie,should have been a good movie because it did start out right... burning a farm down because some fat creditor might get it? Every citizen who wants justice in our real lives sure could use this premise in real life... but hooo boy\n\nProbably got its 5.7 out of 10 rating from the drunken cowboy-farmer population who would buy this thing and then donate ten to the local library and give it a 9 because they could get the sympathy vote after blowing their tellie apart when the evil bank manager shows up on screen??? \n\nGere as a cowboy? Just did not work! Maybe it was the Buddhist Angst just starting to build in him. And Helen Hunt appearing on screen for five minutes to suck tongue with Gere Gee whiz, the earlier session with Gere in a trailer bedroom doing a trailer lady who was once a farmer and lost her farm for the same reasons? Sexual titillation for minutes and minutes (audio only, damn!) made Hunt&apos;s part with Gere totally ludicrous and irrelevant to the theme of the movie \n\nWheehaaaa, ride her cowboy! I was sayin&apos; I mean, with the actress who appeared earlier in the movie and seemed to be one of the rare persons in this film who knew what the term &apos;acting&apos; meant hard to say why Hunt was even in the movie, except maybe as a crowd draw via the billboard titles at the theatres No droolin&apos;, only dumb drawlin&apos; in this thing \n\nThese actors obviously NEVER had to deal with the realities of this stuff farmers do face or they would have applied some real emotion to their acting situations...\n\nFor the moments that Gere did swing a gun around on screen, I was hoping it would turn into a real one, swing my way and put me out of my misery. Happened more than a couple of places in this movie...\n\nOh, watch it for some of the scenery and for that moaning and shrieking scene near the start but DO NOT go out and buy this movie, unless you are one of those kinda people who collects everything about Robert, oooopppps, Richard Gere.... seeeeee. Just proving how fast I wanted to forget who acted in this thing...\n\nThe first movie I have ever rated below 5 because I try to see the good in every movie.... hmmmmm, so why did I give it 3??? Oh, yeah! For the trailer park sex segment that should prove to guys that anything over three minutes might actually interest a real woman... So, it does have some sex education merit, I suppose...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Phantom of the West&quot; was advertised as an &quot;All Talking Serial&quot;, which it was. Unfortunately, most of the actors in the picture hadn&apos;t learned to act for sound. You see many of the exaggerated facial expressions and movements that were commonplace in silent films. I have to admit that this serial was a &quot;poverty row&quot; quickie and that the budget probably didn&apos;t allow for the hiring of better talent.\n\nI found the plot to be very confusing, especially in the first nine chapters. Granted, all is explained in Chapter 10, but it sure made the watching of the first nine very an arduous process.\n\nThe plot is typical &quot;B&quot; western. A man has been falsely accused of murdering a rancher and escapes jail to find the real killer. Along the way we meet a masked &quot;Phantom&quot; whose purpose seems to be to kill off the suspects and place the blame on hero Tom Tyler. The Phantom&apos;s costume by the  way, looks ridiculous. We also have, and this is where it gets confusing, a group of masked riders garbed not unlike the Phantom who ride in and out of the story for no apparent purpose other than to confuse the viewer.\n\nTyler, does his best as the hero whose father was the original murder victim. The fetching Dorothy Gulliver plays Mona Cortez the heroine of the story. Frank Lanning is just horrible in the role of Cortez, the man out to avenge his wrongful imprisonment. Among the murder suspects are silent veterans William Desmond, Tom Santschi, Philo McCullough and Kermit Maynard. Tom Dugan as Oscar the stuttering Deputy Sheriff provides the comedy relief. Speaking of comedy relief, strong man or wrestler (I don&apos;t remember which) Joe Bonomo appears as &quot;one of the boys&quot;.\n\nTom Tyler would go on to better days. Though best remembered for his many western portrayals (on both sides of the law), he did star in two classic serials in the 1940s, &quot;The Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1943).",

Twelve years later, Kishan (Salman Khan) goes to retrieve Sanam (Manisha Koirala) and bring her home as his bride. Unfortunately, Sanam has changed for the worse and wants nothing to do with him.\n\nThis romantic drama/comedy starts off well with a great premise, but dissolves into a ridiculous slapstick in which Kishan ignores the fact that &quot;no&quot; means &quot;no&quot;; the film then becomes serious again, and quite interesting (despite the Stockholm syndrome plot line), but even the solidly good songs can&apos;t make it better than average.",

True she looks very lovely and far younger than the 35 years she was when this was made, perhaps 25 or 26, but she is supposed to be an 18 year old escapee from a reform school and there is no amount of soft focus that could make that believable.\n\nAs far as the rest of the film its a mediocre effort wasting the other two assets it has on hand, Adolph Menjou and Basil Rathbone, in small parts. The story itself is rather ridiculous held up by the talent involved but it&apos;s wasted effort. A forgettable enterprise, all the stars have made better films that should be sought out instead.",

The music, costumes and locations all help to tell a story that was engaging and thought-provoking for the whole family.\n\nThe screenplay strikes a perfect balance between emotional moments and light-hearted humor, making it relatable to eveyone in our family watching this fun tale.\n\nAlso, we stayed until the end and found out there is an end of credits extra.\n\nRunt is a reminder of the challenges of family life, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates heartfelt storytelling. Runt, while the movie is small in size shows we can all have big dreams!",
