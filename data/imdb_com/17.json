      "reviewBody": "I had the opportunity to see this film at Cannes and then again at it&apos;s &apos;real&apos; debut at the LA Film Festival. What a difference! Apparently the filmmakers were anxious to get to Cannes and had not finished the editing. Although I liked it before-- this version really hits the spot without the confusing extras that were still at Cannes. I&apos;m glad I gave it a second chance and in fact I&apos;m now anxious to see it again when it&apos;s released. The film is very layered and subtle. It is beautifully shot and the four main characters are original and yet painfully familiar in their alienation, anger, and despair. The Cowboy character played by Edward Norton seems so simple at first but as he is drawn into the family his character and the truth of his &apos;being&apos; gradually unravels in ways that left me speechless at the end of the film. The character played by Rory Culkin, &quot;Twig&quot;, says very little throughout the film and yet he conveys a sense of yearning and loneliness almost too painful to bare. But even he undergoes an unexpected transformation by the end of the film. My favorite though, was Evan Rachel Wood. I think she steals the show... without trying at all. Her emotions and rebelliousness are raw and totally authentic. She is a luminous creature on the screen. Her relationship with the Cowboy seemed unlikely at first and then became completely believable, especially in the bathtub scene. My main criticism is that the film is demanding. If you&apos;re not in the mood to sink into a fairly deep experience with some shocking moments and unpredictable outcomes--don&apos;t waste your time. This is a film for lovers of independent film and psychological kinds of cinema. There are also several scenes that border on surrealism. I&apos;d be interested to know more about the making of this film and look forward to the DVD. I imagine this film may take awhile to be discovered but it holds tremendous rewards for those patient and thoughtful enough to venture into it.",

      "reviewBody": "Jean-Luc Godard allegedly once stated all that was needed for a film was a girl and a gun. However, once one strips his films of the pretty girl (Bardot, Karina, Seberg), along with the Raoul Coutard images and Michel Legrand (or George Delerue) music, all that is left is the director&apos;s gun trying to force the viewer to accept his political position.\n\nStructured as a letter written on a trip to a woman named Rosa, Godard&apos;s travelogue visits a sick country, the former Czechoslovakia a year or two after the Russian invasion of 1968. Who is responsible for Czechoslovakia&apos;s sickness? Godard rails against the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; those who have betrayed the Marxist-Leninist ideal. In the case of Czechoslovakia, Godard blames the former Soviet Union for invading but also Czechoslovakia for not staying true to the ideal and instead allowing Western business interests into their country.\n\nAlong the way, Godard attacks filmmaker Milos Forman for leaving to make a film for Paramount (actually, it was Universal that released Forman&apos;s Taking off, a much more entertaining movie than Pravda). Then, there are the Czech factory workers making parts for weapons for the North Vietnamese. The factory workers are normal guys just doing their jobs and trying to enjoy their lives. Yet, Godard has to take them to task for preferring to spend their time off watching entertaining movies instead of films that educate, like presumably the one that Godard is making. At this point, I became particularly annoyed. The idea of the workers all singing enthusiastically and working together for the good of the whole community, images the film includes, is a myth.\n\nI watched Pravda the same week I was re-reading Milan Kundera&apos;s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, which deals, in part, with the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. I was not favorably inclined to like Pravda that week. However, even had I watched the film at a different time, I still think I would have been irritated, and a little sad to see the director of Alphaville, Contempt, and Vivre Sa Vie (all films I admire) making, intentionally or unintentionally, an apology for despotism.",

He gets a letter from the mysterious Phyllis (Joan Bennett) who believes her father is being held against his will and tortured in a nursing home. She wants Bulldog to rescue him. He agrees and is helped by his faithful valet and annoying best friend Algy (Claud Allister).\n\nMost early talkies are boring stiff affairs but not this one. It moves quickly, is lots of fun, has exciting action sequences and has a great Oscar-nominated performance by Colman. The sound recording is good and the video is as good as can be expected from a 1929 film. The only negative about this is Allister as Algy. He plays his role WAY over the top and comes across as annoying and unfunny. Halfway through I wanted that guy gone! Him aside though this is an enjoyable and fun early talkie.",

      "reviewBody": "This film done in 2 parts (1955/56) seems at first to be a very James Bondian espionage film with sci-fi elements thrown in.....Ultimately it winds up almost like a Gerry Anderson style live action flick...Which is not a bad thing.\n\nIt involves enemy agents (from an unknown nation but it may be assumed it was the US) that have secret automated facilities set up in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for the purposes of sinking ships.\n\nThe super submarine &quot;Pioneer&quot; and it&apos;s intrepid crew is dispatched to find the source of these mysterious sinking&apos;s...Unknown to the captain, his chief engineer is working for the bad guys, intent on stopping their efforts, at any cost...It seems the real chief had a twin brother who was a circus acrobat who murdered and replaced him.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of subplot here...\n\nUltimately the ruse is discovered thanks to an intrepid diver, a kid rescued from one of the shipwrecks and the sub&apos;s female doctor...Who almost winds up as fish food when the engineer pulls her into the airlock during his escape....This, after leaving a time bomb on board...Nice guy!\n\nThe chief swims (with the help of a marvelous diving suit) to an Island where the fully automated hi tech base is located..As he comes ashore there are strange Easter Island-like statues that bear a remarkable resemblance to Elvis!\n\nThe chief, using voice recognition tech gains entrance to the facility In a set that would make James Bond&apos;s set designer Ken Adam drool the chief launches a whole series of torpedoes aimed at the sub. They bear a remarkable similarity to Star Trek&apos;s photon models...\n\nThe hero, discovering that the airlock&apos;s been sabotaged rides a torpedo to the island and subdues the chief..and destroys the torpedoes.\n\nThe special effects which are usually first class in most Russian films, run from so-so to pathetic....Looking like Derek Meddings&apos; earliest efforts in programs like SuperCar...One cannot fault the imagination packed into this film though....The design of the sub was very interesting and unique, and the gadgets and design within had an oddly deco look to them. Sadly, the sub suffers from the &quot;bigger on the inside, smaller on the outside&quot; syndrome, as there was an actual &quot;full sized&quot; floating set used for surface shots. \n\nInterestingly enough I found several films that came later that used major elements of this Soviet cold war thriller....&quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea-1961&quot; &quot;Atomic Submarine-1959&quot; &quot;Atragon-1963&quot; &quot;Latitude Zero-1969&quot; &quot;Thunderball-1965&quot;......ETC....ETC.\n\nThere are scenes that indicate the film makers had seen Disney&apos;s &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954) as well as Metro&apos;s &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;-(1929). The diving suits look like a cross between those seen in the two aforementioned films.\n\nThere are enough gadgets and goodies in this film to make even the most avid James Bond buff blush!....How about a grand piano that&apos;s a secret code transmitter or a device that looks like a retractable tape measure that will support a man&apos;s weight and allow him to scale the sides of buildings, that and a really spiffy car chase.\n\nIt&apos;s a very talky film - typically Russian in it&apos;s context,\n\nbut ultimately worth seeing - IF you&apos;re lucky enough to find a copy!",

One way is rustle the cattle, another way is the bad guys to cheat at poker and buy up IOUs. Finally to just call a note due.

(shudder) sub-titles. : ) I am always aghast at some people&apos;s reactions to &quot;foreign films&quot; (in other words not Hollywood-produced), much less if it actually requires you to READ the dialogue. If you like war movies (and I am talking about those war movies which have you contemplate the brutality and morality of armed conflict, not those that glorify it... although those can be fun too) then you will... well perhaps &quot;enjoy&quot; is too strong a word as I found parts truly horrifying, not in a &quot;look at the gore&quot; way but in a &quot;man is a terrible beast&quot; way... so let&apos;s say &quot;captivate&quot; you with its intensity and what I felt to be an honest assessment of war and this conflict in particular. Greatly acted and a great idea behind the movie, this film gets 10/10 from me, though as I mentioned it is not the same 10/10 a LOTR or Star Wars gets, this movie is not a popcorn muncher but one that will get you thinking and keep you thinking long after the credits finish.",

Through all the adversity, there&apos;s also a sense that life is worth living. Filmed with a hand-held camera. Some images could have been filmed by a tourist. In fact, one could argue that Kiarostami&apos;s view of Africa is only seen through the eye of a tourist and that the film only promotes voyeurism. But still, the documentary makes us reflect on the huge problems facing Uganda, but also all of Africa today.\n\nSeen at home, in Toronto, on February 5th, 2005.\n\n72/100 (**)",

His autobiography is filmed here parallel with a story of a youth of our days, both seeking answers to same questions. They have masters whose decisions they don&apos;t fully catch, and there are women whose roles are ambiguous. Master and disciple depend in each other, in fierce search for truth; only belief and honor count. Cavani made an extraordinary movie which has not lost any of its charm within years. It is a meditation of man&apos;s destiny and also a narrative of the parallel but non- tangential lives of man and woman. This film can be read as a visual philosophical tract and an homage to Milarepa. Aside of that, the film is very beautiful visually and the great actors fully contribute to the ideas of both Milarepa and Cavani.",

When they end up in the kind of trouble a film with a title like &apos;Prowl&apos; couldn&apos;t exist without, it&apos;s difficult to care for such preening twits. They attempt to ditch their former unfulfilling lives by hitching a ride which unexpectedly leads them to no-nonsense Veronica (Saxon Trainor), and her delightfully bloody slaughterhouse. From here, things get progressively more messy and tense.\n\n&apos;Prowl&apos; is good once it gets going and we get past the lazily drawn &apos;hero&apos; types. It staggers me how obvious it seems to me to make your characters likeable, but that so many directors - Patrik Syversen, here, is one - seem to think that&apos;s too easy. Better to make them edgy in the belief that makes them interesting. It doesn&apos;t! Or perhaps we are supposed to be aching for them to get dispatched in as gory a way as possible. If that&apos;s the aim, then it succeeds.",

It pushes too many, way too many schmaltzy buttons (yeah yeah, I cried about the adorable sort-of developmentally disabled kid that the young woman is the nanny for, but come on, and comparing reactions to the Nazis to standing up to a crazy, anti-Semitic elevator operator is a bit much).\n\nThe changes that the woman goes through relate mostly to her dealings with her parents and they with her, though the changes she puts the Hassidic family through are more moving. \n\nThere&apos;s an indication of an impact on her own sense of Jewish identity when she finally declares herself Jewish to her gentile best friend and some impact on her romantic life when she kicks her leechy Marxist blond, blue-eyed boyfriend out of her bed, but that&apos;s more to do with her independent streak.\n\n(originally written 10/22/2000)",

      "reviewBody": "I know that nowadays the name &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; is met with either a smirk or a sigh, depending on how you view him. His recent movies have hardly set the Box Office on fire (most being released straight to DVD or streaming service) and it&apos;s hard to remember a time when he was A-list material and capable of selling a movie on his name alone. However, there was a brief period in between his blockbusters and his, er, &apos;lesser&apos; films where he made some which were actually pretty good - and yet still seems to have been forgotten. &apos;Knowing&apos; is definitely one of them.\n\nCage is also well known for his own brand of &apos;over-acting&apos; which can be anything from comical to cringe-worthy. Here, director Alex Proyas seems to be able to reel him in enough to capitalise on his talent, while at the same time keep him grounded. Cage plays a school teacher who, along with his young son, stumbles on a code back from the fifties which accurately depicts all the major disasters of the last few decades. If this wasn&apos;t creepy enough, some are set to occur in the next few days and there are some odd-looking men lurking around his family.\n\nI won&apos;t go into the plot too much for fear of spoilers because, I really do think that if you&apos;re into science-fiction then you&apos;ll really enjoy this one. It&apos;s got some nice ideas and isn&apos;t afraid to go in directions that you might not see coming.\n\nCage is still great as a leading man and I&apos;ve been a fan of director Alex Proyas&apos; work ever since he did &apos;The Crow.&apos; This may not have the visual flare of some of his early work, but he deserves props for getting a really good performance out of his leading man.\n\nIf the film has a weakness I&apos;d say its special effects are a little uneven. I was actually really impressed with some of them and they left me pretty creeped out. However, it looks like the &apos;effects budget&apos; was spent on the big set pieces and when it came to some of the &apos;lesser&apos; effects (mainly involving fire) they look very &apos;computery&apos; - if you know what I mean.\n\nThere&apos;s another &apos;forgotten&apos; sci-fi film called &apos;The Box,&apos; starring Cameron Diaz and directed by &apos;Donnie Darko&apos;s&apos; Richard Kelly which feels like it could be set in &apos;the same universe&apos; as &apos;Knowing.&apos; So, if you have seen &apos;The Box&apos; (and again - don&apos;t believe the negative reviews - it&apos;s actually pretty good for some dark sci-fi drama) and you liked it, definitely give &apos;Knowing&apos; a try. It may not be a &apos;feel-good&apos; movie, but if you&apos;re in the mood for some dark sci-fi, or just a Cage fan, give it a go.",

Most people considered the movie one of the dark wave but the message appears to be more optimistic. There is a hope in worst times. The movie is categorized as a comedy, where Til Eulenspiedel excelled in his historical achievement. The comedy shall be funny. This comedy is mellow. It belongs more to the genre of historic films, like Caspar Hauser, by Wernher Herzog. As much as it falls in to history category, it is still contemporary. The chaos through which Til Eulenspiegel played the Spaniards resembles aggravation of our everyday&apos;s life. Every event is symbolical. I wish, there were a DVD available. In my opinion, a milestone in film industry.",

      "reviewBody": "The real question that &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; poses is not why it&apos;s one of the funniest spoofs ever made, but why virtually no subsequent movie in this genre has been any good at all. I used to adore this sort of movie when I was a kid--&quot;Airplane,&quot; &quot;Top Secret,&quot; and the six-episode &quot;Police Squad&quot; show, which became the basis for the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series, were among the funniest films I knew. When I first saw &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; in the theater when I was eleven, I was in uncontrollable laughter for the first few minutes. That was my standard of great humor at the time.\n\nBut the following decades gave us a variety of similar spoof films, some of which involved one or more of the Zucker-Abrams-Nielsen team, and none of these films were even remotely in the league of their predecessors. These included &quot;Hot Shots,&quot; &quot;Loaded Weapon 1,&quot; &quot;Jane Austen&apos;s Mafia,&quot; &quot;Spy Hard,&quot; &quot;Wrongfully Accused,&quot; and &quot;Scary Movie.&quot; These films would typically feature some funny stuff, but you&apos;d walk away indifferently, wondering what the overall point was. Seeing a ponytailed Leslie Nielsen imitating John Travolta&apos;s dance sequence in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is funny for a second, but there&apos;s nothing enduring about such humor. An entire movie filled with such scenes doesn&apos;t amount to much. What&apos;s the big deal about such jokes, anyway? There&apos;s nothing intrinsically funny about making references to other films, even if you do it in a silly way. At what point did the genre go wrong and become such a dreary, uninspired affair? Is it that I&apos;ve just outgrown this sort of humor?\n\nI have another theory. When I first watched &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; at age eleven, I had not seen many of the movies it was spoofing, such as the early James Bond pictures. I was vaguely familiar with some of the clichÃ©s it was making fun of, but many of the political and sexual jokes went right over my head. And the celebrity cameos meant nothing to me. So what was it about the film that appealed to me so much, that made me laugh till my sides hurt?\n\nThe answer is simple: it was the film&apos;s utter silliness. Think of the scene at the beginning when we discover that Ayatollah Khomeini secretly sports a mohawk underneath his turban. Or the opening credits where the police car goes on the sidewalk, inside buildings, on a roller coaster, and so on. None of this makes any sense, of course; it&apos;s just an exercise in pure absurdity. I loved &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; for pretty much the same reason I loved the Three Stooges or Bugs Bunny cartoons. Even as an adult, I appreciate unsubtle cartoon humor when it is handled effectively. As long as it makes me laugh, who cares that it&apos;s not &quot;sophisticated&quot;? For example, the scene where Lt. Drebin breaks into a building and tries to be as quiet as possible, but then inadvertently sets off a player piano, is masterfully filmed.\n\nThus, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; is farce as much as it is satire. As I grew older, I would gain a greater appreciation for the one-liners, like &quot;You take a chance getting up in the morning, crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan.&quot; To be sure, many of these jokes are dumb. They&apos;re supposed to be. That&apos;s the whole point. What I understood even at age eleven was that the movie was essentially playing games with the audience. When Lt. Drebin looks in a drawer and says &quot;bingo,&quot; I knew immediately that the drawer would reveal a bingo board. I was used to this sort of humor, because I&apos;d seen it in the earlier Zucker-Abrams films, where the jokes had a definite logic to them, and trying to predict them in advance was part of the fun. They have far more to do with audience anticipation than with trying to make us laugh at bad puns.\n\nThe modern spoof films have forgotten all this. They&apos;ve forgotten that making a good spoof requires a measure of invention, even if much of the plot is ripped off from elsewhere. Car chases may not be original, but &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; is, as far as I know, the first film in which the chase is conducted by a student driver. This type of cleverness is largely absent from the modern spoofs, which assume that they have no reason to be creative when their ideas are based broadly on other films. They&apos;ve forgotten that the most effective way to make fun of a clichÃ© is by coming up with an ingenious twist. Even the characters in films like these matter, and Lt. Drebin is crafted in the grand tradition of other inept lawmen like Inspector Clousseau. This is what gives the film its own personal stamp that makes it more than an exercise in movie references.",

      "reviewBody": "This is not one of the more famous (author) John Grisham based-movies and it&apos;s a bit talky for my normal tastes, but it was interesting. You can thank Chris O&apos;Donnell and Gene Hackman for two excellent acting performances which helped make this so entertaining in spots.\n\nO&apos;Donnell plays young attorney &quot;Adam Hall&quot; (shades of Matt Damon&apos;s character in another Grisham movie, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;). Meanwhile, it&apos;s no surprise that Hackman gives us another fascinating performance, this time as the attorney&apos;s brutally racist grandfather, &quot;Sam Cayhall.&quot; He&apos;s been imprisoned for a murder and O&apos;Donnell is trying to release him from a death sentence. Hackman&apos;s performance elevates from a &quot;fair&quot; to a &quot;good&quot; movie. While O&apos;Donnell is trying to do his job, a few revelations occur considering his Klansman grandpa. Faye Dunaway also is in here and has a memorable scene with &quot;Sam.&quot;\n\nYes, the critics were right in that this could have been better but they were off base blasting this film. It&apos;s still an entertaining film, and they forget the value of that.",

      "reviewBody": "A shy pastry chef gives a newly employed waitress a lift home. They pickup an attractive, but mentally deranged young woman who is standing in the pouring rain. She gets into the car takes off her clothes and attempts suicide with razor blades. The couple push her out of the car to find she has collapsed and died in the middle of the road. They then hide the body. After the event they find themselves strangely turned on by her death. What follows is Ken murdering men and women using a chef&apos;s palette knife and having sex with Yuri afterwards.\n\nThe mixture of sex and violence is still strong even by today&apos;s standards. The film uses optical censorship, as well as carefully placed objects to obscure the most explicit sex scenes, but there is still frequent nudity and a high number of sex scenes even for a Nikkatsu pink film. The film clearly takes influence from the Italian Giallo films of directors like Umberto Lenzi and Lucio Fulci more so than the &quot;stalk and slash&quot; American horror films of the 70s. The violence is bloody and frequent with much talked about scenes involving a knife being inserted in-between women&apos;s legs.\n\nIt&apos;s all sleazy stuff and aficionados of exploitation films have seen it all before. What elevates this one is nice moody photography, well known faces of Nikkatsu putting in convincing performances and a high level of mayhem.\n\nThe DVD from Mondo Macabro features a nice print and some good extras. I&apos;m not sure if this film would pass uncut in the UK.",

      "reviewBody": "Every where Richard Widmark&apos;s loser character Harry Fabian turns in this film he finds golden opportunities smothered in bad timing. Widmark utilizes a variation of that smarmy, snickering sinister giggle-chuckle that was memorialized in Kiss of Death.It serves the actor well in this film in its toned-down form but offers up a sort of pathetic body language for Fabian, the character. It may be that this American ex-patriot character is just way out of his depth. His hucksterism is not much appreciated by many of his acquaintances in this seedy London underworld. If Harry Fabian would simply accept that he is destined to be a 3rd rate shill and stooge,he might have fund some small pleasures. However, his mind is a shade too quick and his ambition too pumped. He&apos;s a user with not a shread of remorse about stepping on others, ripping them off, keeping one tiny step ahead of exposure. This is a superb film, squalid and sinister in its portrayal of greed, corruption and betrayal."

      "reviewBody": "Outland (1981)\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Marshall O&apos;Neil (Connery) stationed at a remote mining colony on the Jupiter moon of Io uncovers a drug-smuggling conspiracy, and gets no help from the people there, when he finds himself marked for death.\n\nI still vividly remember watching this with my dad, the night he rented it on video. It was the first Connery movie I had watched since Diamonds Are Forever. As nothing he made in between that time interested either of my parents for them to rent the video or watch it on TV. \n\nEssentially this is High Noon in space. A heavily tanned Connery is the new Marshal who does what a man must do. There are a number of parallels. Killers are on their way to kill the Marshal, who is abandoned abandoned by his deputies, and with none of the residents willing to stand by his side. As the arrival time approaches, Connery enters the cafeteria/saloon and speaks to the townspeople, repeating the classic Cooper line, &quot;I could use a little help,&quot; receiving none. He must decide between fleeing and joining his wife and son, or staying and facing almost certain death. \n\nAway from the parallels of High Noon, the plot here is an intriguing one, The miners were being given an illegal drug, which increased their output for 11 months and then drove them insane. Connery actually delivers a good performance, that seems to have been forgotten about by the masses, which is a shame as it still holds up today, and Connery does some great acting in a scene where he doesn&apos;t utter a line of dialogue, as he watches a video of his wife. Connery was not happy at this movie going over schedule, as he lost a major extended cameo role in Chariots of Fire due to it. \n\nAll in all, I find Outland to be an enjoyable movie, with good pacing and a good atmosphere, that I usually watch every couple of years. \n\nOutland did fair business for a Connery non Bond movie grossing $17 million at the domestic box office. Slightly more than its $16 million budget.",

      "reviewBody": "I must say that I didn&apos;t even originally plan on going to this movie, but after I was asked by a friend to see it on its opening night, I said that sure, I would go. I figured that it would be alright, nothing more than mediocre at the most, but this movie was amazingly wonderful. \n\nI have heard many people&apos;s comments on how they didn&apos;t like it because &quot;Myles&apos; accent was completely wrong,&quot; &quot;the chemistry between Franco and Myles was horrible,&quot; &quot;it didn&apos;t even follow the original story,&quot; and many other miscellaneous things. While the story line was changed a little from the original story, I believe that it was still good. And come on, how many times does Hollywood actually stick to the original story anyway? I think that the way the story went was much easier for people who were not familiar with the story of Tristan and Isolde to follow. \n\nFurther, I thought that Myles did a wonderful job with her accents. I found it very easy to differentiate between the Irish and the English. \n\nAnd lastly, I found the chemistry between Myles and Franco to be simply wonderful. They really showed me that the characters were truly in love; it was compelling and deep, put together for a very good movie. \n\nI can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while; it was not the watered-down relationship kind of thing that comes from Hollywood most of the time. From the battles to the most intimate of scenes, it stayed simple; not the high-tech kind of thing that you would usually see. There were some parts meant to be funny, some meant to be sad, and the movie averaged out to give you the best of both. I will tell you that in its opening weekend I saw it more than once, something that I would usually never do. It&apos;s a movie that gets better and better each time you see it; one where you pick out things each time that you had not seen before. \n\nSimply put, this is a wonderful movie. I loved it, but I would not recommend going if you&apos;re just going because you think that James Franco is hott! I know some people who didn&apos;t like it, I won&apos;t lie, but if you come to the movie with an open mind and know that some things are going to be different, you will absolutely love it, as I did.",

In the form of a posthumous letter to Storck, using clippings from the original film, the director paints a personal picture about a corner of Western Europe, where shocking living conditions of those trapped within its boundaries breaks down the myth of &apos;la dolce vita&apos; like even Agnes Varda with her &quot;The gleaners and I&quot; could not... grim and pity less in its accusation of society at large, this is a documentary made on a nothing budget, with only the directors intimate knowledge of the surroundings as the capital... very good first effort... must see for activists and cinephiles...",

This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke&apos;.  We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours.  It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien&apos;) live vicariously through him.\n\nFilled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin&apos; it here boss&apos;, the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history&apos;s most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.  Released the same year as `Bonnie and Clyde&apos;, it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie."

      "reviewBody": "At thirty minutes in I was wondering who would be the first to leave the small audience in the cinema. By the end of this movie I, and the few others, simply sat with our metaphorical mouths agape at the impact of what we had just seen. A slow, meandering, and with hindsight, entirely necessary beginning gives way to a riveting and gripping story. A story which you would expect to bring you to tears (and it will for some) but is ultimately about triumph. It may appear to be a story about 9/11 and such was the enormity of that event that it would be easy to suggest that this is just an excellently acted and well-crafted story about that day. That would be to undersell this movie. 9/11 is just the vehicle which carries the message of how our everyday, minor irritations with other people and our general lives are simply unimportant in comparison to the reality that most people are just trying to do their best in our jobs, our marriages and in our relationships. We are imperfect and the enormity of 9/11 hammered that home. These couple of hours repeats the exercise. But this movie does more than use the day&apos;s story in such a simplistic way. Rather, it weaves the tragedy into the story of lives that are already living with sadness and it allows those participants to view their personal tragedies in the context of the much bigger one. To use the &quot;device&quot; of a compulsive child (what a performance!)forces us voyeurs to focus more clearly on the everyday minutiae which both he and we come to see as insignificant. A wonderful experience...this movie will stay with me for the rest of my days.",

I have to say I agreed.  So what? The scriptwriters borrowed some scenes.  God forbid any other &quot;original&quot; movie has done the same in the last decade.\n\nSome fans need to rid themselves of the notion that a full length motion picture is made for their sole consumption, and respect that many people viewing may not have even heard of the series.  However, the script writers also need to understand the strong following of fans, and include &quot;in&quot; sequences/jokes etc.  Which I felt they did nicely enough.\n\nThe detail spent on the Romulan Star Empire could have been slightly more expansive, the political games being played in the Romulan Senate never were quite &quot;fleshed out&quot; which is a shame, because the Romulans are one of the races throughout the Star Trek saga who have been rarely visible.\n\nThe film took current events to add a current affairs style plot, which I admire.  The smaller (as in, less spelled out) plotlines were excellent, and made the film something to follow rather than a Die Hard clone (yes, First Contact was a.k.a &quot;Die Hard on the USS Enterprise&quot;).\n\nI hope this really isn&apos;t the end for Picard and crew, it didn&apos;t feel like a goodbye picture.  If it was, then the fine actors from the TNG series should take a well deserved bow, it&apos;s been a great series to follow, and as a retired trekkie (I retired when the TNG series wrapped up) I think the TNG series (and original series) will prove to stand the test of time over more recent efforts, kudos to the actors and other people involved."

On the contrary, most of the dry humor and charismatic Garfield poses are difficult to &apos;get&apos; for young children. And yet, the film completely aims for a youthful audience. I have no problem with a movie being pro-children, but this is exaggerated and hardly accessible for adult viewers. The movie totally lacks all the elements that make the comics so entertaining. Garfield&apos;s clever and sarcastic remarks, Jon&apos;s clumsy womanizing techniquesÂ All this has been replaced with an unhealthy dose of feel-good messages and lame jokes. The computer engineered Garfield doesn&apos;t appeal and the other, real pets are badly chosen. The plot is standard-sentiment, with Garfield saving his new housemate puppy from a sneaky, fame-chasing TV host. Breckin Meyer (as Jon Arbuckle) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (as the yummy vet Liz) walk around without anything to do and Bill Murray voices Garfield like it&apos;s some sort of dire job he wants to get rid of asap. The first (long-awaited?) cinema adventure of everybody&apos;s favorite cat appears to be a quickly produced and unprofessional flick soon to be forgotten. Too bad, since you&apos;re left behind with the feeling they could have done something better with this.",

      "reviewBody": "This does not touch the Cronenberg movie (or the Vincent Price movies, from what I&apos;ve seen of those), but is definitely worth the watch for fans of gross-out monster flicks. The plot? The son of Seth Brundle (Harley Cross) is born in a corporate laboratory. He grows up at a very fast rate (now played by Eric Stoltz) and falls in love while discovering the evil secrets of the bigwig and his scientists, who have raised him. Nothing helps him on his quest to destroy them more than when the metamorphosis that took place in Dad begins to take place even faster in Son. It has its funny moments (the under-used John Getz from the original gets some big, cynical laughs), as well as very emotionally moving moments (especially when Stoltz puts the mutant dog to sleep, which is very sad and touching). There is a hackneyed element, to be sure (the romantic part with the awful country song is something that would be perfectly acceptable to fast-forward through), but, overall, it&apos;s still a kinda fun movie that&apos;s more effective than many people might tell you. As far as the gore quotient goes, this one I would consider more of a splatter movie than Cronenberg&apos;s (which had its gross-out moments throughout, but wasn&apos;t as bloody as this one was). Still, if you like gore, I would suggest it especially. I myself have no problems with gore as long as I like the movie around it, and I liked &quot;The Fly 2&quot; enough to actually watch it more than once without that choice being under the influence of substances! Also, one way it was better than the first film was how it ended. While the ending to the first was somewhat abrupt (even if it was a great movie and didn&apos;t really need anything extra), this one features a happy ending that is not sappy (always commendable), as well as one of the greatest acts of vengeance ever agonizingly drawn out on film. All in all, I agree that &quot;The Fly 2&quot; doesn&apos;t really touch David Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;The Fly&quot; in overall quality, but it doesn&apos;t deserve the terrible reputation that&apos;s been heaped on it over the years, even if there&apos;s nothing to disguise the fact that is inferior."

      "reviewBody": "The classic picture, shot by Clint Eastwood, who himself played the main role of a stranger without a name. For me, this picture is certainly not the pinnacle of creativity, directorial and acting, the inimitable K. Eastwood, he just has a lot more work to do. But the film definitely deserves to be seen by many.\n\nAt first glance, it seems nothing new as regards westerns, having taken it in view, the viewer will not see. But it will be so only when viewing the first half of the picture. In the future, all the actions taking place in the film will acquire a raid of mysticism, which will intensify from one action to another and acquiring clear outlines of the supernatural with the development of the storyline. The fact that a stranger appears and disappears in the end of the tape will obviously hint at the mystical interpretation of the picture. And Eastwood himself hinted at the mystical aspect of his work in his interviews. Therefore, this tape will also be interesting to those who love not only the standard work in this genre. It will definitely appeal to lovers of the mysterious and mysterious.\n\nIn the picture itself, by and large, there is nothing to complain about. Everything in it is made to last. It could not be otherwise. Just look at the team working on the film. Here there are only one professional and aurochs of their business, who set and put into practice more than one picture of this genre. Separately, I would like to mention two people, I don&apos;t take Clint Eastwood a priori into account, because everything is clear with him, he is a pro in his field, especially as regards Westerns. First of all, I note the operator Bruce Surtis, who has done an amazing job. His camera is fascinating, he showed a small town in all its glory, the viewer sees it in full view. At the right moment, he pulls out close-ups, thereby creating a lot of stress. The locations that B.Sertes shows are pleasing to the eye, they are amazing. Here, an important factor plays the role of the place where the place was chosen for filming, the endless plains, the scorching sun, the small town. The viewer will see the wild west in all its glory, against which a bloody spectacle will unfold. And the second is noted by composer Dee Burton, who wrote beautiful and very beautiful music for this film. Of course this is not Ennio Morricone. If you compare with it, many composers immediately fade away, so for me, a comparison here with the greatest meter of their work will not be appropriate. And therefore Dee Barton created classical music for this western. For me, this composer stands on a par with the great L. Bokalov.\n\nShootings, for which they love this genre, there is not much. But without them, the film has something to see. Perfectly written out all the characters without exception. Whether major or minor. Each will play an important role, regardless of the time interval occupied in the tape. And be sure everyone here will be rewarded according to merit. The picture does not sag, it was interesting to watch the development of events throughout its entire length, the well-written script clearly contributes to that.\n\nThe output was a harsh and merciless picture, seasoned with a touch of humor and irony, like many other works of this genre by C. Eastwood. But it may seem ambiguous to many people, so of course, it&apos;s your decision to look or not.",

      "reviewBody": "An unnamed and unseen filmmaker finds himself in the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg in what appears to be the 18th Century.  No one seems to be able to see him except his travelling companion, Frenchman Marquis de Custine, who he talks to.  Together the two of them go around the museum, flitting between time as they go, gradually covered 300 years of Russian history.\n\nI was drawn to this film as I have recently had to install digital television in my house (just for 24!) and I figured that I might as well see what the channels had to offer.  After working out that I had access to numerous shopping channels I also found that I had BBC4, the arts and history channel, and that it was to be showing this film.  I was interested in it not for my love of Russian history but for the fact that it was done in one take and, for that reason, I quite enjoyed it.\n\nAs far as plot goes, I really think you need to have an existing knowledge of Russian history as this film will not help you understand anything about it other than a passing impression.  This was the case for me as I know next to nothing of the history, but I was still able to gleam some things about the political relationships between Russia and Europe as well as some of the main players.  However it never got to the point where I was taken or engaged by the material; interested is perhaps a more fitting word to use - and that&apos;s still a good thing.\n\nTechnically the film is gripping and very impressive.  Much was made of Snake Eye&apos;s 20 minute one-take opening (even thought it was actually 3 takes) or Goodfella&apos;s seamless move from street to table, but this film blows them away.  I cannot even imagine the sheer logistics involved in creating such an effect.  It would be impressive if the film was all shot in one room with a few cast members, but this film moves around the museum with a cast of thousands and set pieces that vary from two people looking at paintings to a massive ballroom scene.  I was held totally impressed by the whole film as the entire one take was delivered seamlessly, without flaw. For this reason the acting is impressive whether it is Dontsov&apos;s acerbic Frenchman or just some extra&apos;s - everyone had to get it right bang on time and they did.\n\nOverall this film will be a masterpiece if you have a good working knowledge and understanding of Russian history.  However even if you don&apos;t know that much (like me), the technical aspect of this film will impress you no end even if the material is best seen as `interesting&apos; at best."

We only made it through the first ten minutes (so I cannot say if it&apos;s going to get better. I heavily doubt that). It was our own fault: We should have sent a few prayers to the goddess and let a shaman clean our house from bad spirits and cobwebs before inserting the DVD with this solemn kitsch. But if you plan to prepare for birth by painting your body and going to a place where there&apos;s no electricity and no doctor or to a sacred Indian river which is also used as an overcrowded city&apos;s sewerage, this is your movie. People like us just don&apos;t want no dolphin in the delivery room.",

The first time I saw it I enjoyed the plot, and scratched my head. The second time, I enjoyed the music and the dancing (both great!). Now I saw it for the third time and I didn&apos;t have to turn the captions on. I focused on the actors, their ways, the French, the places and manners. Well, never, not once, I was disappointed. In spite of being a musical, it is a movie that lives life and gives ideas. Highly recommendable.",

      "reviewBody": "Mel Gibson and Franco Zeffirelli&apos;s adaptation of Hamlet has filled some of the gaps left by Shakespeare. This version of the classic story is thoroughly watchable. Gibson is perfect as Hamlet the Prince of Denmark, and he is well supported by Glenn Close (Gertrude), Alan Bates (Claudius), Ian Holm (Polonius) and Helena Bonham Carter (Ophelia). However, after already seeing Kenneth Branagh&apos;s 4-hour long version, I was left a little let down. Although this version was only 2 hours 20 minutes approximately, it was more boring in parts than Branagh&apos;s was. And no one can beat Kate Winslet as Ophelia, though Bonham Carter performed the lunatic scenes extremely well.\n\nThe acting, as is aboveforementioned, is the highlight of this version. You can see the emotions boiling over on Gibson&apos;s face, and Close gives Gertrude&apos;s nature a remarkable realism as both a worried mother and a lustful lover. Bates is the best Claudius I have ever seen, and Holm displays in Polonius what makes him such a great actor.\n\nThis Hamlet has an extremely good set design that complements the mood of each scene perfectly. The castle has a great look to it, both inside and outside.\n\nThe costumes, particularly those worn by Close, are excellent. They really highlight the mood and temprament of her character perfectly. On top of this, all of the costumes worn by the players (actors in Hamlet&apos;s play) in colour and shape symbolise the message that Hamlet was trying to get across.\n\nTechnically, this film is very well put together. The shots are each able to complement the action in that shot. Sound effects, especially in the ghost apparitions, as well as the lighting and juxtapositioning, set the moody feel of the film.\n\nOf course, one cannot escape comparing this to Branagh&apos;s masterpiece, though in its own right is is a great version of Shakespeare&apos;s play that, through its star power and easier-to-follow storyline, should attract the younger audiences that saw Baz Lurmann&apos;s &apos;Romeo + Juliet&apos;, &apos;10 Things I Hate About You&apos; and will possibly see the upcoming &apos;O&apos;. ***1/2 out of *****.",

      "reviewBody": "I love anchor bay entertainment! But like most other distribution companies, they run out of money, and I guess &quot;House of dust&quot; is what you get when that occurs..\n\nFirst off, the story of this movie. Once I got the main idea of the story, a huge face palm was planted on my face. In this case, the story of this movie is clichÃ©d, and has been seen millions, of billions of times before, delivering absolutely nothing new in the sense of entertainment. The so called &quot;Legend&quot; is a massive clichÃ© that has portrayed in many, many other films, as well as the characters, location, etc.\n\nNext, the killer, or foe in this tale. One word, once again, clichÃ©. The killed has been portrayed in many others films! Yet again I say! And in this movie, the killer wasn&apos;t even executed all that well, making him seem foolish, and stupid in a way that drags this film deeper then it already is..\n\nLastly, the cinematography, sound, overall execution, and characters. The characters, or in this case main characters were, like the rest of this movie clichÃ©d. They were a bunch of collage kids that listened to the strong, &quot;better&quot; guy of the group, getting themselves into trouble, and DEATH. The cinematography of the film was shallow. Some shots were flawed, making it look terrible. Some of the lighting, as well made the scenes look dull, and misplaced. Overall depressing - like when it wasn&apos;t meant to. Moving along, almost everything of the film was reliant of CGI, and it was horrible looking. They used CGI from fire, to a shattering light bulb. All of which was horrible, misplaced looking. Finally, the sound. Most of the soundtrack didn&apos;t fit! Some music sequences sounded like action when noting really was happening, throwing us viewers off track! And concluding, the scares. Horrible! There were none, no tension, thrills, nothing. Once we got anything, thought, it was lame, horrid jump scares! No! In conclusion. This is a bad, bad, bad low budget film that tried to be more then it was, leading in an ultimate downfall! This movie failed from beginning, to end! More money wasted! Stay away from this one, I honestly have no intentions of recommending this to anyone, for it&apos;s another uneventful, clichÃ© fest that angers, instead pleasing.",

Filmmaker Gideon Bachman spent a few weeks filming Director Federico Fellini while he was making his 1969 film SATYRICON in various locations in Italy as well as at Cinecitta Studios.\n\nIt&apos;s a real hodgepodge as we only really see what appears to be a handful of filming days. The portrait of Fellini isn&apos;t entirely flattering as he is shown berating a young Dante Ferretti* over an inadequate set, and constantly squabbling with his cast and extras. Famed Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno is also spotted among the crew.\n\nThere are a few moments of levity as Fellini toys with the cast and crew as well as some on set visitors including Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (extolling the virtues of Disneyland of all things!). Bachman conducts some one on one interviews with Fellini, but never gets much out of him. More informative is an audio snippet from Fellini&apos;s mother talking about how the young Federico was fascinated with puppets and the circus from an early age.\n\nSATYRICON is Fellini&apos;s most chaotic film, so, perhaps, it&apos;s no surprise that this documentary ends up being much the same itself. It&apos;s mainly for Fellini completists.\n\n* Ferretti was an assistant on this film, but later became an Oscar winning Production Designer (Hugo, Aviator, Sweeney Todd)"

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s make something perfectly clear: Morgan Spurlock doesn&apos;t really want to find Osama Bin Laden. I can only assume his real motivation for making Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden? runs parallel with his motive behind Super Size Me - to educate fat, stupid Americans. Considering everyone around the world knows there&apos;s a lot of fat, stupid Americans, you could say the target audience for this documentary would be as big as the one that made SSM a must-see hit. But, to Spurlock&apos;s detriment, there are things people are ready to hear and there are things they aren&apos;t. Based on the critical and box office woes of WITWIOBL, it would seem no one in the USA wants to hear the truth about the so-called War on Terror.\n\nSpurlock might be preaching to the choir of informed critics who know exactly why the US is globally detested, but right here in the good old US of A, he&apos;s asking the masses to swallow a very bitter pill. I say the pill is bitter because he spends the duration of his film humanizing Muslims, letting them speak for themselves in ways that radically contradict the conveniently palatable perception Americans have of their (ahem) enemy. The Muslims Spurlock interviews are not gun toting, blood thirsty, irrational, unreasonable or anti-American Jihadists, instead they are the exact opposite: peaceful, reasonable, rational, logical and kind. While there is no doubt a shared resentment towards the US Government, the resentment is justified. \n\nSpurlock doesn&apos;t pull any punches in his quest, he tells the history of US foreign policy as it happened and this version doesn&apos;t hide the fact the US has been in bed with brutal dictators and regimes for a very long time. The fitting quote provided by FDR sums up the US attitude to their profitable alliances with murderous thugs: &quot;He may be a son of a bitch, but he&apos;s our son of a bitch.&quot; This understanding of US foreign policy begs the question: is it any surprise they hate the US Government? All actions have resultant repercussions and if you consider that US foreign policy has marginalized, oppressed and killed millions of people, then is it any surprise when the victims bite back?\n\nThere&apos;s one particular interview with one of Spurlock&apos;s subjects that basically makes us ask: if the US military can describe civilian casualties as &quot;collateral damage,&quot; then what do you call the innocent Americans killed by a Jihadist&apos;s attack? It&apos;s all a matter of perspective and Spurlock posits the uncomfortable reality that war is war and their loss of innocent lives hurt and resonate just as much as ours do.WITWIOBL is by no means a deep or probing study of the issues in the Middle East; it glosses over the complex history of the region and, at times, does so in a very adolescent way. Spurlock, an obvious student of the Michael Moore school of documentary film-making, makes light of many topics by (over) using animated cartoons as a means to parlay a number of ideas. Spurlock uses a mock-video game template to structure WITWIOBL and, despite it being a new approach, it doesn&apos;t do the film any good. While on one hand I can appreciate Spurlock is trying to bring a little levity to a very serious subject, his gags are rarely funny and his overall schtick is wearisome. But if you stick with WITWIOBL you&apos;ll be rewarded with a film less about Spurlock&apos;s self-indulgences and more about having a better understanding of the Muslim world. \n\nSpurlock concludes that, ultimately, Muslims and Americans want the same thing: to have a better world to bring up their children in. Fine for those who have kids or want them, but I don&apos;t. As a consolation, I&apos;d be happy to settle with living in a world where people were introspective enough to realize it takes two to tango. WITWIOBL might open the eyes of a few, but in a country divided by two political parties, asking a filmmaker to bridge the divide between two foreign world&apos;s might be asking a bit much. Nevertheless, WITWIOBL is well intentioned even if it has nothing to do with it&apos;s title.\n\nhttp://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",

For a comedy of its type, and all of you know what I mean by this coming of age sort of comedy, it had a lot of slow parts that weren&apos;t funny, and needless sentimentality that only served to slow the movie down. However, when it was funny, it was super funny.\n\nThe ongoing gags were pretty notable, and performances were top notch, notably by Seth Green as the sarcastic Amish guy. This may reign as best sarcastic performance in any movie, ever. The energy between the various performers was right and helped execute most of the gags effectively. As I mentioned, I have complaints, but they are trivial. If you want some goofy humor to eat popcorn to, give it a shot.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me explain. This is the first film in which (what I consider to be) the greatest comedy team of all time appear. They are not the leads, but steal the show with every scene that they&apos;re in. The plot of the movie is interesting enough to hold one&apos;s attention. An insurance salesman sells his friend &quot;Love Insurance&quot; which insures his marriage to his fiancÃ©e. When Lucky (the salesman) falls in love with Steve&apos;s (his friend) fiancÃ©e, things get complicated. Throw in Steve&apos;s second love interest, a crooked nightclub owner and his two thugs (Bud and Lou), and a larger than life Aunt and you have yourself a twisted (but funny!) little feature. Each time Bud and Lou show up they give off a radiance and freshness that is truly a joy to watch. The gags include two tens for a five, mustard, Jonah and the Whale, an abbreviated &quot;Who&apos;s on First?&quot;, and Lou&apos;s cut in pay. The last bit I mentioned is extremely funny and I&apos;m not sure if it appears in any of their other films so watch for it! The rest of the cast is pretty decent and the music doesn&apos;t really help or hurt the film. It&apos;s a great way to introduce someone to the team. Recommended for A&amp;C fans, fans of classic comedy and films, or simply someone who wants to smile a little! Just warning you though, this film will leave you craving more Bud and Lou, so have another of their films at hand. Enjoy!!",

      "reviewBody": "It should come as no surprise that I had never actually heard about this 2006 movie titled &quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot;. I mean, an action thriller with Mariel Hemingway and David Keith in the leading roles wasn&apos;t exactly an equation that I would assume to be a fabulous result.\n\nHowever, as I happened to stumble upon the movie by random chance here in 2024, of course I opted to sit down and watch it, on account of it being a movie that I have never seen before. And I do believe in giving a movie a fair chance.\n\nI didn&apos;t know what to expect from writers Paula Goldberg and Anna Lorenzo, so they had every opportunity to entertain me with this movie. However, truth be told, then I wasn&apos;t expecting a whole lot from the movie.\n\nThe script and storyline in &quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot; was actually okay. It wasn&apos;t exactly rocket science here, not was it a particularly complex storyline. But I will say that writers Paula Goldberg and Anna Lorenzo put together a fair enough script and storyline, making this a movie that is watchable a single time.\n\nWhile I was actually only familiar with Mariel Hemingway, David Keith and Jill Bennett on the cast list, I will say that the acting performances from everyone on the cast list were fair. The actors and actresses took a somewhat simplistic script and made it work. I actually never associated actress Mariel Hemingway with action movies before watching this movie.\n\n&quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot; wasn&apos;t an overly memorable movie, though it was suitable for a single viewing. I can, however, in all honesty say that I am not returning to watch &quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot; a second time.\n\nMy rating of director Brian Trenchard-Smith&apos;s 2006 movie &quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot; lands on a four out of ten stars.",

I only saw this movie just to get entertained. After the movie started, the owner of the Twins passes away from natural causes. He gives his team to his grandson, Billy. After Billy fired the manager, he becomes the manager of the team on their quest to win the pennant. As a baseball fan, I do find it pretty hard to see a kid managing the team, but this is purely entertainment. I was happy to see major league stars such as Randy Johnson, Ivan Rodriguez, Paul O&apos;Neill(especially), and Rafael Palmeiro. As a die-hard Yankees fan, I am glad to see great views of Yankee Stadium. At least I will see this film when I want to see the old Yankee Stadium because they are tearing it down soon. In entertainment areas such as acting, everything is simple and smooth. A good baseball film! I rate this movie 8/10.",

Each time I get something from it and i believe it is Bette Davis best work - which is a big statement ! Viewers will be hypnotised by Bette&apos;s amazing performance and the filmography is truly amazing. To watch this film through modern eyes, you often find yourself trying to work out how the director and editor managed to get away with the &apos;two bette&apos; film sequences. This is no evidence of &apos;lines&apos; in the film, or murky backgrounds and if you didn&apos;t know it was the same women, you would really think they were twins. The story line is terrific, Glenn Ford (very young) fits the role perfectly and Dane Clark&apos;s performance is very direct and well played. There really is something for everyone in this film and a must watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Certain precisions: \n\nThe Paul Wegener film of 1920 Der Golem : Wie er in die Welt kam/The Golem: How He Came into the World was not exactly &quot;the originaL&quot;. It was the third film to be made on the subject. The original, Der Golem, directed by Wegener and Henrik Galeen in 1915, alas survives only as a fragment. Inspired by the success of the novel Der Golem by Austrian writer Gustav Meyrinck (serialised 1913-14), it was not really an adaptation but an original script, although, like the Meyrinck novel, it was set in modern times with an antiques dealer rediscovering the golem. The second film , also lost, Der Golem und die Tanzerin/The Golem and the Dancing Girl (1917) was a comic sequel, again obviously set in modern times.\n\nWegener and Galeen were responsible for one very important element in the story, the idea that the golem was susceptible to the charms of the fair sex, a theme that would be enormously influential in all subsequent &quot;monster&quot; films including Whale&apos;s Frankenstein and King Kong. This element was retained in the film of 1920 which is a kind of &quot;prequel&quot; going back to the supposed sixteenth century origins of the golem in Prague and its creation by one of the great heroes of European Jewish culture, the Rabbi Loew (Judah Loew ben Bezalel) to protect the Jewish community against the depredations of the Emperor Rudolf II.\n\nSo this film is certainly not a remake of the German films but it is a sequel of sorts to the 1920 film in the sense that it follows it more or less immediately in chronological terms, being set just after the death of Rabbi Loew and still during the reign of Emperor Rudolf (played by Harry Baur). It is however based on a new work - a 1931 play by two well known Czech actors Jiri Voskovec and Jan Werich.\n\nThe &quot;golem&quot; legend has a long history. It may have influenced Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein (1818) but this is uncertain. It is true that a very young Jakob Grimm (one of the brothers later famous for their fairy tales) had published a Polish &quot;golem&quot; story in 1808 (in the collection Journal for Hermits) which inspired other stories on the theme and might possibly have been known to Byron, the Shelleys and their circle. It is however absolutely certain that the German &quot;golem&quot; films influenced upon the later film-versions of Frankenstein.\n\nThe specific story of the golem of Prague was seemingly of German rather than Czech origin and was largely a nineteenth-century invention.It only subsequently seems to have become a popular story in Bohemia/Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe French actor Harry Baur was not Jewish nor he was exactly killed by the Nazis. He did frequently play Jewish characters and had a Germanic name, two factors which led to his being falsely accused during the forties of being Jewish. He was arrested by the Gestapo in occupied France in 1942, ironically just after returning from Germany, where he made his last film, Symphonie eines Lebans (actually part of an extended visit by French actors and actresses organised by the German propaganda ministry). He was held in La SantÃ© prison in Paris for four months and eventually released without charge but never fully recovered from the ill-treatment he received and died in April,1943.\n\nSeveral accounts say he was arrested with his wife or that he was arrested on account of his wife, who was Jewish. The first is correct but the second not. Baur&apos;s second wife, actress Rika RadifÃ©, was born in Turkey and, although she may well in practice have had Jewish origins (her real first name was Rebecca), she was actually a Muslim (and neutral Muslim Turkey was friendly to Germany until it opportunistically sided with the Allies in 1945) and she was released just two weeks after the arrest. She was never subsequently troubled and later in fact converted to Catholicism.\n\nBaur&apos;s involvement with this film probably did him no good in the eyes of the Germans. Duvivier himself moved to the US in 1938. Although other countries, including the US and Britain, were outrageously silent on the subject of the persecution of Jews in Germany (and remained so even during the war), there had been a certain discrete propaganda effort by some producers during the thirties as more and more Jews fled or attempted to flee from Germany. So the British film The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) clearly draws a parallel with the flight of French aristocrats from the Revolution (both producer Alex Korda and star Leslie Howard were of East European Jewish origin)and another British film of the same year, The Jew Suss, had a pro-Jewish theme that would later be answered by the anti-semitic German version of the same story in 1940. The British film starred expatriate German Conrad Veidt, not a Jew but a fierce and strongly committed anti-Nazi (he even devoted part of his income to the cause). \n\nIn the US, another dissident German, Wilhelm Dieterle, whose wife was Jewish, made The Life of Ãmile Zola in 1936 (concentrating on the Dreyfus affair) and later drew a clear parallel in his depiction of the persecution of gypsies in his 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The House of Rothschild (1934) would also paint a sympathetic picture of Jews which particularly infuriated the Germans and resulted in another anti-semitic riposte (Die Rothschilds Aktien auf Waterloo) in 1940). \n\nThe only film to openly expose and attack German treatment of the Jews, Professor Mamlok, was made in Russia in 1938. Although praised by anti-Nazi campaigner Edward G. Robinson (from a Polish Jewish family), who said he wished he could act in such a film, it was widely dismissed in the US as communist propaganda (which it also is) and was actually banned in Britain for fear of offending Mr. Hitler."

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a lot of negative things been said about Audrey Hepburn&apos;s interpretation of the role of Eliza. Perhaps she&apos;s not ideal in the earliest scenes of the movie - her &quot;dirtiness&quot; is never quite believable - but it has to be said that despite this smallish drawback she still glows, and makes an amazing Eliza overall.\n\nThe reason for this is simple; Audrey Hepburn brings her &quot;own spark of divine fire&quot;, (to quote Higgins) to the role and her vulnerability, mixed with her sweet, naive charm and even her wonderfully juvenile pettishness shown in &quot;Just You Wait&quot; all prove what a talented actress she really is. For an example of this, just watch Eliza&apos;s facial expression at Ascot, when she realises her opportunity to demonstrate her new-found mastery of the English tongue - sweetly hilarious.\n\nMFL has been criticized as being too romanticized, too overblown. I disagree; musicals are suposed to be lavish affairs, and none pull it off quite so well as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; does. It&apos;s a momentous film but it has its subtle points: watch the way in which Eliza&apos;s eyes are centred on Higgins when she enters at the ball, and the way in which the two of them stare at each other for a few seconds at the top of the stairs a few moments later.\n\n It musn&apos;t be overlooked that, thanks to its being based on a Bernard Shaw play, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; has what the great majority of musicals lack: a deeper meaning and something really quite profound to say.\n\nThe actor in the role of Colonel Pickering is a little weak, but it must be said that Rex Harrison IS Henry Higgins. In a lot of ways (in fact, in most ways) Higgins has an objectionable personality: rude, snobbish, impatient and even misogynistic, but somehow Rex Harrison pulls it all off and makes us like Higgins without betraying the character. As to romance, his song &quot;I&apos;ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face&quot; is an ode to the kind of love which sneaks up on you. Overall, this movie is romantic, but not too sentimental. It has just enough romance to be dramatically fulfilling, but it never becomes soppy or mawkish. The word &quot;love&quot; is never mentioned at all and the two leads never even kiss. The famous end sequence is perfect and does the movie justice; after all, a big happy bow tied around a perfect romance at the end would simply not fit with everything we have learned about the two protagonists.",

It took me about 30 min into the movie to start to suspect what going on, but I was not trying to figure out the movie. This was a cool little sci-fi flick. Nothing earth shattering but well done and entertaining. I am glad I watched it. I like the theme of Robots and humans. I love the show Real Humans (2012â ) &quot;Ãkta mÃ¤nniskor&quot; from Sweden. In that show they called the Robots, Hubots- best name ever. Now it has been remade for the UK/US version, (not nearly as good as the Swedish version). Still good. Those shows take the theme of Uncanny further.",

It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the &apos;Horror&apos; genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original â just: Wow!\n\nIt&apos;s clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the &apos;office clerks&apos; alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) â this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me. Thank you Joss and Drew! 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a shame Lonesome hasn&apos;t been seen more widely by modern audiences. The limited acclaim it&apos;s received is well deserved. \n\nLonesome is very simple. It&apos;s no more than a little romantic movie of two people who fall in love and then appear to lose each other. But the whole thing is told expertly well. The camera moves about freely in many unique and interesting ways. Visually alone, it&apos;s quite the spectacle. It also helps that the two in the lead roles are enjoyable.\n\nGlenn Tyron is good enough in his lead role, but his romantic interest, played by Barbara Kent, is the real star. She is fun and playful when needed, but her soulful eyes convey more pain then most people ever could with their voices. Her charisma is evident from shot one. \n\nThe only downside to the film is the inclusion of a few sound scenes. Clearly done just to cash in on the new craze, it actually only serves to grind the story to a halt. It forces the movie to become stationary, and the dialogue itself is pretty inane.\n\nI cannot recommend the film strongly enough, though. It&apos;s as enjoyable of a romance as you&apos;ll ever see. There&apos;s nothing too complicated here: just two people falling in love, and it&apos;s a joy to see.",

But as the film unfolded, and the storyline, a complex one, began to unravel it all started to make some kind of sense.  My favorite part has to be the self destruction of his apartment, that was quite imaginative.  Before I saw this i was expecting something along the lines of Lethal Weapon, being the same star, and same director.  But it was so completely different from what I thought it would be and it actually ended up being a better film as a consequence. Mel Gibson played a completely different character than what we usually see, which worked to his benefit and Julia Roberts proved with this film, that she still had star power.  Definitely worth a look.",

The actors are good; Angelika Waller&apos;s (Maria Morzeck) performance is amazing. The technical style is impressive considering that this film was shot in the 60&apos;s. (It introduced several innovations like the use of a hand-held tape recorder).\n\nAlthough I&apos;ve seen some loopholes in the story and questionable continuity in some scenes, &quot;The Rabbit Is Me&quot; gained my respect.\n\nI&apos;ll give this film an 8!",

A light play around a &apos;dram-car&apos; and of course love, where the rich car-salon owner fells love with a poor, but attractive young girl. To reach her hands, he makes as if she had won the car as a prize, and to get close to her, he offers his service as a chauffeur with sharing the income to prove that he&apos;s poor too. At the end of course everything turns out and we get the casual happy end. Sadly, the best piece of action, the wonderful way of Gyula Kabos&apos;s speeches and dialogues is only meaningful for Hungarian viewers."

If you haven&apos;t seen the film yet, watch it before reading this!\n\nPlot: Shortly after Broly&apos;s defeat on New Planet Vegeta at the hands of his maternity ward neighbor Goku, Broly has managed to survive and escape to Earth via an Attack Pod. The elements enclose around him for seven years, and it&apos;s not until Goten starts crying over an apple that Broly gets back into action. Seeking revenge on Goku, his friends, and his offspring, it&apos;s up to Goten, Trunks, Gohan, and Videl to stop the Legendary Super Saiyan. But when the boys and Videl are down for the count, can Gohan stop the menace that was defeated by his father seven years ago?\n\nThis is the second of four Broly films I&apos;m binge watching, with &quot;Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan&quot; being the first one I watched. Needless to say, it has just as much action as the first Broly film, but some comic relief as well, specifically in the form of Goten and Trunks.\n\nAfter collecting six of the Dragon Balls with Videl, Goten and Trunks head off to stop a T-Rex that&apos;s been terrorizing a village. However, when Videl smacks an apple off of Goten&apos;s hand during their stealth mission, Goten loses his marbles and starts crying. Unbeknownst to him, as well as Trunks and Videl, this awakens Broly from his seven year long slumber.\n\nVidel being beaten down with ease and Trunks and Goten dueling with Broly catches Gohan&apos;s attention and he heads after them. Gohan catches up with the kids and duels with Broly, causing Broly to enter his Legendary Super Saiyan form and Gohan to enter Super Saiyan 2. This is one of my favorite fights in the Dragon Ball Z movies.\n\nThis movie does lose some points for me, however, because of Broly&apos;s death in at the end. He could&apos;ve at least apologized for what he did to Goku and the rest of the gang. But Broly dying in the sun was cool as well.",

If you&apos;ve seen the new version before, you&apos;ll be amazed at how different the old version really is. In the old series, action, jokes, and flirting are much more common. The new version relies on political events and characters.\n\nAlthough this 1978 version of the film moves a little slowly in places, there are the fascinating space battles. The dialog between the characters and some of the comedy is a little dated, however. I would recommend it if you&apos;re a fan of this genre.",

      "reviewBody": "two things I really enjoyed in this movie: one is the acting of Terence Hill, very energetic and dramatic. The other is the effort to give a historical and political background to the story of the &quot;bandit&quot; Graziano Mesina. The introdution to the movie says &quot;&quot;The Barbagia is the innermost area of Sardinia ... it&apos;s a corner of Europe but does not belong to Europe. Here the European culture has not penetrated. From the 4th century BC Sardinia has undergone many dominations. But the rulers, the oppressors, they were never able to conquer the Barbagia. In the rest of Sardinia the populations were affected by the costumes of the rulers, are the Sardi collaborators, before Africanized, Semiticized, Romanized, then later Spanish-ized, piedmont-ized, and now Americanized. The Barbagia instead is the land of the resistance. The Barbagia shepherds might perhaps be at the year zero of technology civilization, but sure they are the year 3000 of their civilization, and that a civilization with barbaric aspects.&quot;.\n\nThe movie explains also how these &quot;bandits&quot; were in reality maneuvered by much more sophisticated criminals, who finally dropped their help to a uncontrollable Graziano.",

This prompted me to purchase the original musical with Robert Morse and I was not disappointed.  My wife preferred the live musical, however what attracted me to the video was the performance of Rudy Vallee as Mr Bigly.  Frank Loesser&apos;s score is marvelous, I think that the song &quot;The Company Way&quot; is a humorous parody of those corporate types who risk nothing that will damage their careers.  This video is one that I&apos;ve watched over and over and I can recommend to any musical lovers other than ardent feminists who might be turned off by the 1960s type relationships between the men and women."

      "reviewBody": "Risky Business and All The Right Moves are the two films that launched Tom Cruise&apos;s career as brat pack film star. Unlike so many of his contemporaries from the Eighties, he&apos;s proved to have staying power and will no doubt continue to do so. \n\nAll The Right Moves established Cruise as a dramatic actor, but Risky Business is a fun comedy about a hormone driven teenager who when the folks go away from his Chicago suburban home and he&apos;s left to play, he gets himself in all kinds of problems. First dialing up call girl, Rebecca DeMornay and then not having enough coin of the realm to pay her. Then getting mom&apos;s treasured glass egg stolen. And then getting the family car driven into Lake Michigan.\n\nBut Cruise and DeMornay, who is having trouble with her pimp Joe Pantoliano, hit on the brilliant idea that there&apos;s a market out there for his group of eager overachievers. And Tom&apos;s house becomes quite the swinging brothel.\n\nRisky Business turns out to be pretty funny business. Best scene in the film involves Tom with Princeton interviewer Richard Mazur. You&apos;ve got to love the way this boy gets into the Ivy League. Second best scene involves Tom and the family car as it plunges into the lake and then gets hoisted out.\n\nTom&apos;s definitely proved to have staying power in show business. I can see his character in Risky Business growing up to be Jerry Maguire.",

This is a bunch of most untalented and unmotivated actors I have ever seen!! Everything else speaking of bads is in the shadow of bad acting. Then, the movie lacks the suspense or even the scary scenes. It looks like a very sloppy and unintelligent work. The only good thing I found good in this said movie making is some nice camera work - especially in the very beginning in the scene with sheep. I am really not into criticizing the low budget movies or amateur work but since I was hooked to watching by many positive reviews I want to write this one to make you guys aware of spending 15 minutes of your life the better way. Oh, yeah, exactly 15 minutes is how long I could watch this crp.",

Unknown to Marie, her room-mate is involved with a musician at the club who leads a gang that has kidnapped the ex-opera singer wife of a government minister for ransom. Though the police fail to find her, a retired policeman who has befriended the girls cracks the musical code used by the victim to attract rescuers (a not-new trope, seen for example in Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;).\n\nI won&apos;t recount any more of the plot since, despite two beautiful Frenchwomen and a talented Hungarian as director, all three having been in some of the best French films of the previous decade, it is the scenario that in my view lets them down. Stretches of vivid dialogue, colourful character acting and picturesque locations do not in themselves a good movie make. Though the two lovely girls were always a joy to watch."

Here they actually address a few of the biblical discrepancies that don&apos;t match up with other historical accounts (eg. the so-called Massacre of the Innocents which has never been corroborated by Palestinian history). \n\nOstensibly, the writers Vittorio Bonicelli, Franco Rossi and Francesco Scardamaglia must have consulted with rabbinical experts to get all the cultural details right. There is a verisimilitude here seldom seen in similar films. \n\nThis was actually made just BEFORE The Last Temptation of Christ and there&apos;s nothing presented here that would scare off &quot;secular&quot; or non-Christian viewers. \n\nBest of all is the memorable score by the legendary Piero Piccioni. Looking forward to seeing the original Italian version with sub-titles, though they actually did an excellent job on the English-language version!",

Let&apos;s face it, anyone under 50 probably never heard of Paul Whiteman, and anyone under 40 only knows Bing Crosby from his Christmas album. That leaves the rest of us.\n\nFor The Rest Of Us, it doesn&apos;t get any better than &quot;King Of Jazz&quot;. That, of course, was Paul Whiteman, rotund band leader of a bygone era who is the nominal star of this film. He was not an actor, and so the film is given over to actors and other entertainers. The accent here is on &apos;entertainer&apos;, as this movie is festooned with lots and lots of them. \n\nEver see Bing Crosby with his real hair? Ever see the Radio City Rockettes, thunder-thighed in the late 20&apos;s? Ever see George Gershwin in a movie? How about vaudevillian Al Norman with his rubber-legged dancing? It&apos;s all here, in a non-stop revue of old and almost-forgotten songs and dance numbers (there are 18 in all), interspersed with blackouts and comedy skits. Plus, it&apos;s in color (sort of) - actually, it&apos;s primitive 2 strip color. \n\nI could go on and on but if you are a hard-core movie fan or a film historian, &quot;King Of Jazz&quot; is for you. The jokes are stale, the singers still trilled their &apos;R&apos;s, and the gowns in the bridal number are so out of style they are probably coming back. The overall effect was both sheer delight and visually overwhelming and I wished it would never end. It is available only on VHS and hasn&apos;t been seen on TV in years. It is a must for The Rest Of Us.\n\nP.S. Ever see Paul Whiteman tap dance?"

Now it seems time has changed: ten-year-old children are playing horror-video games so probably what was too scary for them in the eighties is just right and fun now. Actually this is just what you could expect from a movie about a monster house: funny, spectacular, sometimes frightening. Quite a well-developed story - even if it is full of clichÃ©s, or should I say homage? - with the usual &quot;two boys, one girl&quot; trio as seen in Star Wars or Harry Potter. The animation is strange at first: they seem like rubber dummies, but thanks to the motion capture, their movement and expressions are first rate. While they look like having plastic hair, there is a great development since Polar Express in one field: their eyes are constantly moving - full of life. And the whole movie is just a typical and fun Spielberg-Zemeckis production with elements of Hitchcock. Besides the extraordinarily dark scenes it just feels like those very entertaining Spielberg productions of the eighties.",

It is not only the leading pair who serves as a good example of cowards and vulnerable people. There are also some secondary characters who provide fitting description to words such as coward and vulnerable. The names of the woman&apos;s mother and her husband come to mind to provide a suitable description. In &apos;Letter from an unknown woman&apos;, Max Ophuls celebrates the immense power of a letter to convey feelings of disappointment arising out of a failed love affair. The letter in question is quite a long one. It was drafted by a woman to tell her doomed life to her lover. Ophuls depicts all the troubles which a woman is compelled to take in order to get love. It would not be wrong to state that love is out of fashion in current times. It has been replaced by something which resembles love but has a certain amount of physical force. There were times in the past when intense feelings of love were appreciated. &apos;Letter from an unknown woman&quot; is one such film which has the ability to transport viewers to a time when love mattered a lot.",

      "reviewBody": "Madigan is directed by Don Siegel and adapted to screenplay by Abraham Polonsky and Howard Rodman from the novel The Commissioner written by Richard Dougherty. It stars Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Inger Stevens, Susan Clark, Harry Guardino and James Whitmore. Music is scored by Don Costa and cinematography by Russell Metty.\n\nPlot finds Widmark as Detective Daniel Madigan, who along with his partner Rocco Bonaro (Guardino), loses a suspected murderer who also makes off with their guns. Causing embarrassment to Police Commissioner Anthony Russell (Fonda), who is hardly a fan of Madigan&apos;s methods, they are given 72 hours in which to locate the escapee and bring him in. But as the two men go in search of the crim, Commissioner Russell has various other problems to address, both at work and with matters of the heart. Last thing he needs is a volatile Madigan screwing things up...\n\nBased on a book called The Commissioner, a film originally titled the same, and the most interesting story thread in the picture is that of Henry Fonda&apos;s Commissioner! Then why is the film called Madigan, who is an interesting character that really is only second fiddle in this particular Don Siegel orchestra? It is one of the odd and frustrating things about the piece, the story is complex enough without being unsure who to focus on, a shame because Widmark, Clark, Fonda and Whitmore are doing sterling work for their under pressure director (Siegel was constantly fighting with producer Frank P. Rosenberg).\n\nThe themes at play are deliciously enticing, infidelity, police corruption, family strife, friendship, loneliness and identity etc etc, threads are dangled and given thoughtful dialogue passages. But hang on! Wasn&apos;t there a murderer on the loose at the beginning of the film? Half way through the piece I had forgotten about Steve Ihnat&apos;s crim that opened up proceedings, surely that can&apos;t be right? Film looks terrific at day time, though, where Metty&apos;s bold Technicolor photography really gives the New York locations a sense of 70s wonder (I know it&apos;s a 60s movie but it feels very 70s, and in a good way as well), though Costa&apos;s score is far too blunderbuss for narrative themes.\n\nIt&apos;s a mixed bag, a film you just know should be better considering the talent in front of and behind the cameras. Ideas at core are strong and worthy of filmic adaptation, while the last quarter is electrifying and crowned by a classic foray into film noir territory. But really this is recommended as just above average entertainment for the cop/crime movie fan. 6/10",

The film mixes genres quite liberally although one wouldn&apos;t expect spaceships and aliens in a period drama at all.\n\nThe story follows an unkempt swordsman hero as he wields the over-sized Sword of Alexander the Great protecting a princess and keeping his magic sword out of the clutches of the Shogun and an evil alien who has crash landed in Japan.\n\nThat&apos;s not all the plot details but I think it&apos;s probably enough to give an idea how this film goes. The film is very funny and a good amount of action influenced by HK cinema. The special effects are unrealistic and intentionally humorous. The characters are interesting and the hero is unique in Japanese cinema as far as I know. He is the son of a African man and a Japanese woman. The aliens aren&apos;t the only weirdness in the story, a number of other villains are demons with odd powers. The acting is over the top but that goes with the wacky story. The movie has only one unfortunately out of place joke at the end but otherwise it&apos;s a lot of fun. Several movie references will be obvious but some of the cameos might be mysterious to non-Japanese audiences.\n\nRecommended.",

      "reviewBody": "One of my all-time favorite hobbies is collecting VHS tapes. Sure, it&apos;s not as fun now that all the major rental stores have either been shut down or don&apos;t carry the format anymore, but it&apos;s still fun to browse online. On that note, any self-respecting VHS collector knows one of the rarest finds is a big box VHS of 1987&apos;s LUNCH MEAT.\n\nA group of fun-loving teenagers decide to head up to a cabin in the woods for the weekend. However, the gang encounters a backwoods, cannibal family looking to chop them up and sell their meat to the local hamburger joint. Will anyone survive? \n\nIndeed, will anyone survive the grating experience that is the unbelievably inept LUNCH MEAT? I know I did, but just barely. Honestly, this is one of the only films I&apos;ve come across that nearly fails on all levels, both in actual quality and genuine entertainment. However, a few bits of cheesy goodness put it one or two levels above the bottom of the barrel.\n\nThe people who made this obviously had no idea what they were doing, which is blatantly obvious because of how poorly executed everything in this movie is. The acting is horrible and these people are clearly friends and family of the director (it does have Ashlyn Gere, who starred in one of my favorite cheesy slashers, 1986&apos;s EVIL LAUGH). Also, I have to throw in that one character sounded a lot like Roger from the show American DAD.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with LUNCH MEAT is the chase. Here&apos;s the case: first, we get thirty minutes of hilarious character development (hilarious for the wrong reasons, of course). Then we get a forty minute long chase scene that&apos;s just that: people running around. Nothing happens except PEOPLE. RUNNING. AWAY. It has to be one of the most excruciating things I&apos;ve had to sit through in a while.\n\nThe film does have the occasional fun and/or funny moment, but they are few and far between. For the burger stand, they just put a white sign reading &quot;So-and-So&apos;s Burgers&quot; on the side of a run-down building in downtown Detroit (or some other place). Some of the character interactions are amusing as well. Once the final couple begins to fight back, the pace picks up considerably, but it resorts back to mediocrity after a while.\n\nOverall, I don&apos;t want to say LUNCH MEAT is worth watching, but I don&apos;t want to advise anyone to avoid it at all costs. It has its fun moments, but the painful-to-watch middle section is enough to scare anyone away. Also, for a film to sell itself as a really gruesome movie filled with carnage, there isn&apos;t a whole lot of bloodshed. In fact, I might even say I enjoyed CANNIBAL CAMPOUT more than this. It&apos;s that bad.\n\nMy advice: If you stumble upon it by chance, watch it once just to say you did. Then throw it in the trash.",

      "reviewBody": "Master film-maker Kenji Misumi returns in the Lone Wolf and Cub series to helm the fifth entry, Baby Cart in the Land of the Demons, and if you thought even just for a fleeting second that this would be anything but orgasmically violent and existentially mystifying, you just don&apos;t have enough confidence on the man.\n\nPicking up the story of the Shogun&apos;s former executioner Ogami Itto and his son Daigoro, this is another tale of betrayal, political intrigue and murder. The Kuroda Clan is in deep trouble, trouble that Ogami Itto&apos;s fierce opponents, the Yagyu, want to exploit for their own benefit. Ogami Itto is paid his usual fee (500 gold pieces of course) and bloodshed ensues.\n\nNow as a chambara and LWAC fundamendalist, I will confess upfront that the combination of stylized comic-book violence and the existential, quasi-mythic look at both historical Japan and the genre conventions that form chambara, are a sure win in my book. It might not be as groundbreaking as the first two entries in the series, it is after all following a now well-tested tradition, but it is done with such conviction and deliberation that one has to pay notice. \n\nAs with other serialized characters of the chambara universe like Zatoichi or Nemuri Kiyoshiro, it is exactly that it simultaneously meets our expectations as a pure Lone Wolf movie that doesn&apos;t disappoint the way Hollywood sequels do and that it breaks the traditional forms of the period drama that make even a fifth entry of this tried and tested recipe so good.\n\nThe plot is of secondary value to the actual journey of Itto and his son. They have been through the crossroads at Hades and now into the land of the demons and there is no turning back. What pushes them through piles of dead bodies is revenge, and I say &quot;them&quot; because Daigoro has made his commitment to follow the same path of blood as his father, their fates inextricably linked through life and death; yet as with other Lone Wolf movies revenge is but a vague part of the storyline. A skeleton that gives these movies form and reason to be but they take life beyond that. \n\nIn Lone Wolf and Cub&apos;s case their journey is an existential fable bathed in blood, like they are doomed to cut their way through the land for all time and it is through the act of killing that their existence takes meaning. It takes one look at Ogami Itto&apos;s grim stare to realize that if there is a god and he would dare to appear in front of him, Itto would swiftly cut him down and move on his path. Takashi Miike understood all this crystal clear when he made Izo.\n\nSpeaking of blood, yes, there will be lots of it. It&apos;s a staple of the Lone Wolf movies and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. Arterial sprays, chopped heads and bodies sliced in half. And then there is Tomisaburo Wakayama, the man, the myth, crafting the most mesmerizing character role of his career.\n\nStrongly recommended as are all the other Lone Wolf movies. Watch them in order though."

Miss O&apos;Brien tugs at the heartstrings in this lovely holiday story that will have you longing for more! No doubt Margaret O&apos;Brien was one of the most talented young actresses of all time. Her simple beauty, her ability to come across as a real child, and her talent for delivering lengthy lines never fail to astound you. The story is simple but tender, and other leads such as George Murphy and Angela Lansbury, take a backseat to Miss O&apos;Brien. When she is in a scene, you cannot take you eyes off her. Just as in Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, and Lost Angel, Margaret O&apos;Brien is a delight. A don&apos;t miss for any fan of hers and an even bigger treat for those who have never seen her films!",

Stan and Ollie are planning on taking their wives and their uncle (Edgar Kennedy) for a nice peaceful picnic, a &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.  They encounter difficulties even before getting out the door, and once they get into the car, the real chaos starts. Stanley has a very funny bit trying to change a tire, and there is a nicely done subtle joke when, in the midst of a heated &apos;tit-for-tat&apos; battle with a neighbor, everyone suddenly jumps up and runs inside - what did they see? &quot;Perfect Day&quot; is a good comedy and worth a look."

Not to mention, they probably couldn&apos;t afford Martin Lawrence for the lead role, so they filled it with Cedric the Entertainer, who does better in supporting roles. Cedric does have several funny scenes, though.\n\nThe plot is completely unintelligible, and undeveloped, but based on the genre you can predict most of the action. It&apos;s the ever-popular &quot;hero has something secret the bad guys want, so they can sell it to terrorists for a fortune, but it&apos;s missing.&quot; Not to mention, the scenes or &quot;shticks&quot; that have been better done elsewhere. For example, every time Cedric tried to be funny with judo moves, I kept thinking that he ripped that off from Martin, who does it much better. There is a brief cat-fight scene that is far inferior to the one in Undercover Brother (which is an excellent movie, and much funnier overall).",

      "reviewBody": "Curse of Chucky is better than most horror movies that get a theatrical run. The staging is rather small, with a small unknown cast and a limited location, but they make the absolute best of everything they have. Brad Dourif, the original director, and another important cast member from parts 4 and 5 appear; and this movie actually seems like a return to the formula of the original movies, using some of the surprise and humor of the last two. A woman caring for a disabled daughter, and living in a lovely Gothic mansion, receives the Chucky doll anonymously. After being quickly dispatched, the rest of the family arrives to take over the estate from the daughter. Among them is a little girl, who adopts the Chucky doll. The parents of the girl seem to have ulterior motives and a strange relationship with their babysitter, which is later revealed as a pleasant and humorous twist. Chucky begins killing off the victims, using the creepy mansion as a great backdrop. The camera work is great. The suspense is good. There are some great kills. This movie does not look cheap. Its only VOD concession seems to be that it sticks to the same location over the same night, and changes settings only rarely. The last entry seems to largely avoid parts 4 and 5, although it does not erase them completely. Often, horror movies that deviate from formula come out disastrous, but Chucky reinvented itself as a series with Bride and Seed of. Fans of those movies may be disappointed this doesn&apos;t pick right up where they left off. Still, it&apos;s a nice surprise to go back to the pure cheesy formula horror of the first three movies. The ending, of course, leaves room for a sequel that could play off the theme of the movie, and revisit dangling threads from the earlier series. Well worth renting, streaming, buying.",

How that type of pioneering ambitious attitude has changed new jersey from the 1700s until today.Learn how the Pheasant has made it&apos;s way to the west and then America and see what weird people are playing and caring and hunting pheasants now. The world of fictional animals is even explored: Have you ever heard of a vegetable lamb? Neither has anyone but we have deemed it fake so it isn&apos;t around. The movie even touches on when people stopped believing in dragons? It is much later than you&apos;d think. A must watch for animal lovers."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Step Up 3D&quot; maybe the best 3D movie since &quot;Avatar&quot;. You laugh. For one thing &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; was filmed in 3Dâno post production enhancement. Seeing amazing street dancing is visually stunning in 3D. One distinguishing sequence has Moose (Adam G. Sevani) splashing his moves on the water flooded stage. In another electrifying sequence the dance troop Pirates move in unison in LED lit costumes. One sees &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; for the 3Dâentirely.\n\nNo ground breaking storytelling here. Amy Anderson and Emily Meyer&apos;s screenplay barely eclipses perfunctory. This is the coming of age story of misunderstood young people overcoming the odds to compete in the First Annual World Dance Jam. The dialogue is awful. We endure the speaking interludes throughout the movie to get to the dancing, which is spectacular. Director Jon Chu has a dramatic sense of line and chaos with a provocative and flourishing visual style.\n\nThe dancing is spectacular. Jon Chu has assembled some of the best street dancers in the world. The Santiago Twin (spirited Martin and Facundo Lombard) just kill in the World Dance Jam. Chadd Smith as Vlad, whose specialty is the Robot dance, is absolutely awesomeâin 3D the effect is mesmerizing. Sharni Vinson, who plays stunningly beautiful and ripped nomad street dancer Natalie, is elevation and grace combined. The capoeira practice she performs with Luke (cool and handsome Rick Malambri) is high velocity precision. Chu is also a student of the classic musical. He films an homage to &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; in a single take with Moose and his almost girlfriend Camile (Alyson Stoner) as they duet down the street. Chu also provides such visual texture and touch in the World Dance Jam itself mixing the Wushu influenced Asian street dancers along with the breakers and the poppers.\n\nEven with the corny dialogue and lame story lines, the opening sequence gets it right. Luke (Malambri) runs a shelter and dance studio for down and out street dancers- his parents&apos; legacy. Luke&apos;s passion is film-making. As the movie opens we see Luke film interviews with his dancers. This wonderfully captures that dancers are never more present to life or have more joy than when they are dancing. Authentic passion transcends the written words, and is inspired. In a roundabout way &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; is at its best when it is in the moment in 3D, Otherwise, we are left with that Moose is too stupid, albeit a brilliant engineering student, to see that Camile is in love with him, and that he really loves her. Mysterious Natalie may not be who she appears, and that she and Luke are falling for each other. And does anyone really take a train to Los Angeles from New York? \n\nWe kind of know the answers to these questions. So what there is to do is enjoy the dancing.",

      "reviewBody": "Grizzly is directed by William Girdler, written by Harvey Flaxman &amp; David Sheldon and stars Christopher George, Andrew Prine &amp; Richard Jaeckel. Story sees a giant Grizzly Bear terrorise campers and hikers at a state park. The head park ranger sets about capturing and killing the beast but he&apos;s met with resistance from his superior and troubled by the number of glory hunting hunters who descend upon the park.\n\nIf you pardon the pun, Grizzly was a &quot;monster&quot; surprise hit of 1976. Made for a paltry $750,000, it went on to make over $39 million Worldwide. It may well be a &quot;Jaws&quot; coat tail hugging copycat (and it unashamedly is), but credit where credit is due, William Girdler &amp; David Sheldon spotted an opening in the market and got in there in a blaze of blood, grue and roaring ferocity. It was also one of the first of a number of &quot;Jaws&quot; knock offs, and while it&apos;s silly at times, and beset with bad acting, it is, however, one of the most popular and fun cult horrors of the 1970s. Filmed on location in Clayton, Georgia, Girdler&apos;s movie knows exactly what it&apos;s about. Keeping it relatively free of extraneous and expositional filler, Girdler knows (and so does the cast) that the bear is the star of the show - well more to the point, that the bear shredding and chomping down on humans is the star of the show. And so it goes, the humans - except for our hero protagonist (George) &amp; wise sage naturalist (Jaeckel) - are annoying and lining up to be either bear lunch or to be badly proved wrong. And what fun it is. It&apos;s the sort of film that scared us to death as kids, and now makes us smile as adults.\n\nThe film has proved popular enough over the years to warrant a double disc DVD release. A release that wouldn&apos;t be out of place for some critical Oscar winning darling I might add! Now available in a quite lovely anamorphic widescreen presentation (2.35:1), Girdler&apos;s (and cinematographer William Asman) shooting around Clayton is very pleasing on the eye. Sure some of the inexperience of the editing and lighting departments exists, and the budget restrictions are now even more evident (check out the blood), but Grizzly actually does look rather nice. The extra disc is chock full of goodies, with the &quot;Jaws With Claws&quot; featurette enjoyable and showing the makers to be very tongue in cheek about the whole thing. So, a must for B movie creature feature fans who don&apos;t mind a bit of camp on their cheese sandwich then. Those looking for an &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Gorilla&apos;s In The Midst&quot; obviously need not apply, so lets mark it as 6.5/10 for the film, and 7/10 for Shriek Show&apos;s smart 2 disc DVD package.",

As a big fan of their previous work &quot;Metal: a Headbangers Journey&quot; I had a lot of expectations of this film, but was still pleasantly surprised.\n\nAlthough as a youth I had been somewhat aware of Metals International heritage due to Bands Like Sepultura and the almost endless TV and movie Jokes about Bands making it in Japan, I was impressed by the truly Global scale of this film. Covering some countries most viewers will know little or nothing about, the Film making duo paints a rich portrait of Metal&apos;s global flavor.\n\nThe depth of this documentary is impressive, delving into the politics and cultural contexts behind the Metal scenes in many of the countries. This is part of what raises this film above what could otherwise have been just snapshots of a few bands and fans.\n\nOn top of it all is the Music, oh the music. After admittedly drifting away from my head-banging youth for the last few years, this film captured the raw energy that got me into Metal in the first place and sent me right back where I belong, into the arms of the Metal Militia.\n\nA must see work for fans of Metal, Documentaries or both.",

Perhaps it&apos;s the great writing from Mary Rodgers, author of the book, or the spectacular acting from the entire cast, especially a young Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris.\n\nThe film is incredibly funny, without being stupid, and it feels very real and authentic, an element that is gone from almost every other Disney film of the era. Although it includes the typical Disney chase scene, the rest of Disney&apos;s usual cliches are dropped so that the focus is on the characters and the believable and hilarious situations that they get into.\n\nA definite 10/10! Go rent it! Be sure that you get the 1977 version, though, not the 1995 remake."

Antonio Pietrangeli, the director, who died very young (49 years old) has made several excellent films, absolute masterpieces actually, films to be seen and seen again at any time: &quot;I Knew Her Well&quot; (1965), &quot;The Magnificent Cuckold&quot; (1964 ), &quot;The Visit&quot; (1963), &quot;The Parmesan&quot; (1963). Antonio Pietrangeli also worked with Alberto Sordi in the episode &quot;Fata Marta&quot; from &quot;The Queens&quot; (1966).

First off, the animation is great. The characters are likable and fun to see on screen, and the whole idea of the movie is interesting. Though some of the acting is bad, and the plot isn&apos;t fully explained, and the ending is a little anti-climactic, the rest of the film makes up for it. I also enjoyed the sub-plot of the film, and Holli Would&apos;s dancing (thought it was obviously rotoscoped). But overall I really do believe this is an underrated film, because it contains the sexiest cartoon ever made: Holli Would. I&apos;d recommend this film to a friend, and watch it the second time. It really is a film you&apos;d remembered."

      "reviewBody": "There are two versions of this movie that are strikingly different in their impact and emotional meaning. The theatrical release is a 2-plus hour-long studio edit. The director&apos;s cut is 3-plus hour-long edit that was released later. I watched both versions back-to-back, and without question, the director&apos;s cut is the superior. It&apos;s not just a matter of additional footage putting more meat on the bone--more heart is added to the film as well.\n\nThe movie is a violent and gritty portrayal of the Crusades era in medieval times, but wrestles artfully with complex issues of faith, morality, justice and diversity and what it means to live a godly life. Apparently, the studio decided such thematic depth was a drawback and that audiences are mostly superficial morons, so they insisted on an edit that presented it as an action movie, leaving in just enough character development to feebly sew the action scenes together. In the process, not only character motivation was lost, but important plot developments in the story.\n\nAfter watching the shorter edit first--which seemed disjointed and filled with holes in the way of crappy edits--I had to go look up the movie&apos;s synopsis online to understand what the hell I had watched. In the director&apos;s cut, it was much clearer. But the biggest difference is the thought-provoking character development and dialogue scenes throughout that bring an intelligence to the primitive times being depicted.\n\nAt the end of the studio edit, I felt uninspired and filled with a sense that the movie had many missed opportunities.\n\nAt the end of the director&apos;s cut, I felt I had seen a real movie with real ideas. And I was left thinking about it.\n\nRidley Scott has had some bad luck with studio interference in his edits, most memorably with the two versions of &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; You would think they&apos;d trust his instincts after all this time.",

      "reviewBody": "White Feather is out of Panoramic Productions, it&apos;s directed by Robert D. Webb and stars Robert Wagner, Debra Paget, John Lund, Eduard Franz &amp; Jeffrey Hunter. It&apos;s adapted from a John Prebble story by Delmer Daves &amp; Leo Townsend. It was filmed in Durango, Mexico, with Lucien Ballard on cinematography duties (CinemaScope/Technicolor) and Hugo Friedhofer provides the score. Plot centres around the peace mission from the US cavalry to the Cheyenne Indians in Wyoming during the 1870s, but problems arose because a few of the Cheyenne refused to leave their hunting grounds.\n\nOne of the few 1950s Westerns to show sympathy towards the Indian plight, White Feather is a well intentioned and well executed movie. It suffers a little from familiarity with Broken Arrow (1950), where Delmer Daves had directed James Stewart and Debra Paget thru a similar script to the one that&apos;s now in front of Wagner and Paget; and lets face it-Wagner is no Jimmy Stewart- and Robert Webb is no Delmer Daves-but there&apos;s more than enough good here to lift it above many other liberal Westerns.\n\nAway from the endearing and emotive story (and it is as the Cheyenne are forced out of Wyoming by the Federals), the film also boasts high points for the Western fan to gorge upon. It&apos;s gorgeously shot in CinemaScope by Ballard, a first class lens-man in the genre, and Friedhofer&apos;s score is pulsating, evocative and in tune with the tone of the tale. Also of note is that these Native Americans aren&apos;t caricatures or pantomime Indians. They may be being played by white actors (Hunter &amp; Franz do especially good work), but they feel real and come out as the human beings they were. In fact the whole movie looks convincing.\n\nThere&apos;s some missteps along the way; such as Wagner over acting and having a voice that&apos;s sounds out of place in the Wild West, while the romantic angle (Paget is so beautiful here who could not fall in love with her?) does at times threaten to clog up the narrative. But these things don&apos;t hurt the film. On the flip side there&apos;s the smooth pacing of the piece, it&apos;s only when the tense and exciting climax has arrived that you realise how well the slow burn first half was handled. And Webb may well be a second unit director in all but name here, but his construction of the scenes with hundreds of extras is top notch work.\n\nA fine and under seen Western that is based on actual events and doesn&apos;t over egg its pudding. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Volcano High&quot; takes every Anime high school cliche ever made and slaps them all together in a two hour extravaganza of amazing special effects, side-splitting humor, and an intentionally overacting cast.  The result is cinematic perfection.\n\nThe main story is about Kim Kyeong-Su, a young man who seems to get into fights no matter where he goes - causing him to be kicked out of 8 schools previous to Volcano High.  This is his ninth and final chance at success, so he can&apos;t afford to mess up.  Unfortunately for Kim, Volcano High is a school that thrives on fighting - and Kim, being the new guy, is prime choice. Because of this, he spends a lot of the time getting his hindside handed to him.  Once a conspiracy to overthrow the principal and introduce capital punishment to the student body comes into play, Kim realizes he can no longer stand by and let things unravel this way.  Therefore, he decides to join the other students in a battle against the newly hired teachers designed to wipe out all of the fighters at Volcano High...\n\nWhich is where we, the unwitting audience, bear witness to some of the most insane battles ever displayed on film.  The final battle has to be seen to be believed - but that&apos;s all I&apos;m going to say!  I leave it up to you to watch the movie for yourself.  Trust me, it&apos;s hard to find, but worth the effort... Especially Hyo-jin Kong as So Yo-Seon!\n\n&quot;Volcano High&quot; ranks up quite high in my list of favorites.  See it for yourself, and discover if you feel the same way!"

      "reviewBody": "Though its not the first time Ultraman has been done in animated form(this show was preceded by one &quot;Za Urutoraman: Ultraman Jonias&quot;), this is the first time that Ultraman has been done outside of Japan(yes this series precedes Ultraman: Toward the Future by a couple of years) I&apos;ve always thought that animation was the better way to go to fully flesh out epic battles between monsters and giants, and this show proves it. No longer encumbered by goofy looking rubber suits, laughable special effects and other limitations of live action, this short lived TV movie allows the concept that is Ultraman to be fully realized.\n\nThe movie starts off with a team of stunt pilots called the &quot;Flying Angels&quot; consisting of Scott, Chuck, and Beth. During a mid flight accident, they are caught in a bizarre flash of light and crash, only to emerge unharmed. The trio have now become the host bodies of warriors from M78 sent to capture escaped monsters who have arrived on Earth. They become the Ultra Force under the guidance of an old golf course groundskeeper(who is actually an intergalactic peace keeper agent), and assisted by 3 robots, (Andy, Samson and Ulysses). From their headquarters within Mount Rushmore(think Team America) they respond to any sightings of monster attacks across the globe. If a monster proves too tough to take down by conventional means, one or more of the team is required to transform into an Ultraman(or UltraWoman in the case of Beth), a powerful red and silver giant, to battle the monsters.\n\nThe first thing anyone would be blown away by is the look of the show. Sure is hard to believe that this show was done by the same company that did Flintstones, Jetsons and Scooby Doo. The level of art detail is astounding with all the right color tones, shadowing, metallic sheen, and dark/light contrast. Dynamic shot angles and some creative storyboarding adds to the dramatic effect and impact of many scenes, especially the intense battle sequences. Too bad the richly detailed art comes at a price, which in this case is the animation. The frame rate is inconsistent with many shots looking only as well animated as a modestly budgeted animated TV series. There are a few good &quot;money shots&quot; like the Ultra Transformation sequences, some aerial fighting scenes and the signature &quot;finishing moves&quot;, but other than that, the animation is mediocre at best.\n\nThe characters are likable with great personalities given form by a excellent voice cast assembled by Casting director Andrea Romano(who would go on to cast and direct the critically acclaimed Batman Animated series and other DC animated series). The 3 robot sidekick characters might remind one of Alpha 5 from Power Rangers but they are a lot more helpful to the team(not just giving combat strategies and advice but also actively helping the Ultra force when they are in trouble) as opposed to Zordon&apos;s irritating little desk clerk. They are also great in lending a lighthearted tone to some of the scenes with the interactions among the 3 robots resembling that between C-3PO and R2D2 in Star Wars.\n\nThe storyline is in keeping with many Ultraman staples with A more competent script, a romantic subplot and stronger adherence to the whole science fiction setting of the series thrown in for good measure. IT definitely has a stronger &quot;saturday morning cartoon&quot; feel, which fits in well with the animated nature of the show and does not take away from the overall entertainment value.\n\nIt was a huge pity that this TV movie, quite obviously a pilot movie for a potential animated series, was never followed through. Instead it descended into obscurity, appearing only on a few TV broadcasts, bootleg video tapes and most recently, youtube. Such a waste of opportunity considering the potential the show had. \n\nUltraman: The Adventure Begins is truly THE show to watch for some good giant vs monster action. Viewers of all ages young and old, Ultraman fans or just cartoon addicts, would get a real kick out of viewing this.",

      "reviewBody": "Todd Stephens offers his second fine film about gay life (Edge of Seventeen was his first) and aptly titles it ANOTHER GAY MOVIE. It is a colorful, fast-paced, wonderfully silly, knock &apos;em dead parody of gay stereotypes boasting a fine cast of actors who know how to pull this caper off and seem to have a terrific time doing it! Four gay high school friends make a pact at graduation that they will loose their virginity before Labor Day. Egged on by the gross lesbian Muffler (Ashlie Atkinson) the four plan their ploys in a funny session and the fun begins. Andy (Michael Carbonaro), in constant fantasy about his teacher Mr. Puckov (Graham Norton) &apos;prepares&apos; himself with various instruments only to be discovered in embarrassing situations by his wild mother (John Epperson aka Lypsinka) and his bisexual father (Scott Thompson). Nico (Jonah Blechman) is so over-the-top outrageous that he believes no one knows he is gay - not his warmly wise mother (Stephanie McVay) or his hilarious blind &apos;girlfriend&apos; Daisy (Joanna Leeds). Star-struck he goes after celebrities such as Richard Hatch (playing himself) to little avail. Jarod (Jonathan Chase) seems to have little trouble attracting studs like Beau (studly James Getzlaff) and Griff (Mitch Morris) is stricken with the hunky stripper Angel (the ever so buff Darryl Stephens). Each young man finds the trail to loss of virginity a trial but it all comes together &apos;in the end&apos;.\n\nFilms like this are tough to pull off: audiences think they will be offended by the fairly frank and inside jokes. And perhaps with a less talented cast the movie could be off-putting. But this ensemble cast knows just how far to push the button and the result is a hilarious romp that has a lot of very worthwhile undertones. Grady Harp",

      "name": "a missed opportunity",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Carnosaur&quot; is a film that can probably blame its obviously low budget on it being a missed opportunity. This movie contains many good elements including a very wonderful performance by Academy Award-nominee Diane Ladd. About half of the time, this movie kept me entertained in its own unique way and the other half of the time I was bored to tears. Thus, I give it two stars out of four. Half and half. Sounds fair to me.\n\n&quot;Carnosaur&quot; is loosely based on a novel by John Brosnan about a mad scientist (Diane Ladd) who is disgusted by the human race&apos;s destruction of the planet and plans to wipe it out with a killer virus while genetically engineering dinosaurs so that they can take over the planet once again.\n\nI was really surprised that film critic Gene Siskel, who had given the Oscar-winning masterpiece &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) a negative review found this movie appealing and gave it a marginally positive review. But now that I&apos;ve actually seen the film, I can agree with him part way. I still give it a negative review, but I do see why he might have enjoyed it. First of all, like I mentioned earlier, Diane Ladd plays a terrific villain in this movie. Even though she was given some awfully poor lines to act on, she somehow managed to keep me interested and even a bit frightened whenever she was on the screen. I&apos;ll say this; she is a lot more interesting than the dinosaurs in this picture. Perhaps the reason &quot;Carnosaur&quot; was even made was to beat Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) to the big screen and make a little cash, which it did despite negative reviews from both critics and audience members. The film was made on a low budget and you can tell by the bad acting (excluding Diane Ladd, of course) and the poor special effects. The dinosaurs are seldom convincing at all. They are portrayed using rubber puppets and even though they are shot at night, they do become revealing at times. Sometimes painfully revealing. I also felt that the amount of blood and gore used in this film was way overdone, but that is typical of films of this grade.\n\nAnd there is also one major plot problem in this movie. If the Diane Ladd character wants to wipe out the human race, why not just create the virus and not even bother with the dinosaurs at all? Why go through all the trouble and risk being caught? Of course, the dinosaurs were thrown in one because of the novel source and two to get people interested in seeing the movie, but still it almost seems as though &quot;Carnosaur&quot; would have been better, at least more logical, if there were no dinosaurs in it at all. And it also doesn&apos;t make any sense that she only breeds carnivorous dinosaurs and no herbivores. There are some strangely appealing elements to &quot;Carnosaur&quot;, much to my surprise, and there are some ludicrous and unbelievably poor elements, as anticipated. It is just too bad I wasn&apos;t surprised more while watching this movie. A few re-writes of the script and a slight ante in the budget would have done it wonders.",

After a wild night of passion, Zoe admits that she has not one, but two buns in the oven and despite the big surprise, Stan decides to pursue a relationship with her anyway. Really????! Overall, Stan and Zoe deal with a few bumps in the road, followed by major insecurities, especially Zoe due to her lack of trust and inability to develop a close connection with anyone. Now let&apos;s be serious, There is absolutely nothing new or surprising about this movie. It&apos;s your usual boy meets girl storyline which reminds you of how impossible it is to take something that&apos;s far from mediocre so seriously. &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; is a decent movie to watch if you can&apos;t help shutting your brain off for more than 45 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has nothing to do with reality. It portrays Germans as polite and cultured soldiers, but they were actually degenerates, mercilessly torturing innocent people. Also, the death in gas chambers is depicted in a gentle, theatrical way. In reality, people died in convulsions, writhing in their own excrement and vomit, amid horrifying screams of despair, pounding on the doors. Death in the gas chamber was absolutely terrifying and nothing like what the movie showed. Its historical and educational value is zero, and it actually distorts history. I doubt if the author&apos;s intentions were actually as they were portrayed at the beginning of the movie. It seems more like an attempt to conceal the true scale of Nazi terror and cruelty. Such a film might be suitable for children at best. For those interested in the true picture of this inhuman Nazi invention, I recommend the movie &quot;The Champion of Auschwitz.",

It&apos;s introducing a swath of new superhero&apos;s and doesn&apos;t really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero&apos;s. That job on its own isn&apos;t an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it&apos;s just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn&apos;t take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I&apos;m not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",

This is the most realistic film I&apos;ve ever seen and it is typical of action in the Chu Lai area at that time. That&apos;s because it was real and the film crew remained with Mike Company for three months. I saw this when I returned from Viet Nam in 1968 and was surprised to see such reality and never forgot about this film.\n\nYears later I saw it advertised in a magazine and purchased the video but later on loaned it out to a friend and never got it back. If anyone knows where it is possible to purchase it these days please let me know. I&apos;ve looked but cannot find it anywhere. \n\nNear the end of the film it shows a village being burned and the peasants being forcibly moved from their fields, animals and ancestral burial grounds. This was definitely not the way to win any hearts and minds. I have to wonder if that scene has anything to do with the film being unavailable.",

      "reviewBody": "I said several months ago that no one could play Ali except Ali. I was right. Muhammad Ali does a magnificent job playing himself in this movie. Maybe he&apos;s no actor, but in this case he accomplished what he set out to do, and he had several really effective scenes, such as when he explained why he didn&apos;t want to go to Vietnam, and the scene where Clay demanded that he no longer be called by that slave name.\n\nThis was the third film (as opposed to documentary) that I saw on the life of the great boxer. David Ramsey did an okay job in the first one, and Will Smith tried his best but didn&apos;t quite capture the champ as only the champ could. Smith may have been the best actor out of the three, and certainly his film was the best.\n\nChip McAllister made young Cassius Clay too much of a clown. He was okay, I guess, but the portrayal of the character improved dramatically at one point, and I also noticed the actor looked so much more like Clay. That&apos;s when I remembered: Ali himself was playing the character.\n\nErnest Borgnine did a capable job as Ali&apos;s trainer, but this was not one of his best performances. James Earl Jones did a fine job as Malcolm X, brief as the performance was.\n\nI learned a few new details about Ali&apos;s life I didn&apos;t know before. I also found out that &apos;The Greatest Love of All&apos; was written long before Whitney Houston made it a hit. \n\nThe main reason for watching this movie was Ali himself. He was the greatest."

      "reviewBody": "Manon of the Spring is the sequel to Jean de Florette, released the same year. By no means should Manon be rented without having first seen Jean. By no means, in either case, should one glance at the movie notes on the reverse side of the video box.\n\nAlmost nothing can be said safely about Manon without giving away the overall plot or this or that twist or turn. Suffice to explain that Jean concerns an urbanite hunchback who relocates to the Provencal countryside with his wife and daughter, intent on raising rabbits. Manon picks up some years after the Jean conclusion, with the daughter having grown to young womanhood. (More prudish prospective viewers need to know that this will be explicitly evident.)\n\nThis is superb movie-making. Other reviewers accurately call it a masterpiece. The story line dominates, not the acting. Even so, Yves Montand continues his excellent performance from Jean, and Daniel Auteuil as the unsightly nephew is more impressive after one sees him clean-cut and sophisticate in something like Un Coeur en Hiver (1992). Emmanuelle Beart and Hipployte Girardot say very little, yet it doesn&apos;t detract from their respective essential portrayals. Anyone who becomes a Beart fan is advised to rent Nelly &amp; Monsieur Arnaud (1995).\n\nThe two movies, prequel and sequel, work as a team. By virtue of its powerful denouement, however, Manon of the Spring is the standout of the pair. For the same reason, in my opinion, it is one of the very best films of the 1980s."

      "reviewBody": "1960&apos;s &quot;The Hands of Orlac&quot; was the third screen version of Maurice Renard&apos;s 1920 &quot;Les Mains d&apos;Orlac,&quot; following Conrad Veidt&apos;s 1924 German silent and Karl Freund&apos;s 1935 &quot;Mad Love&quot; (a fourth remake was completed months later, Newton Arnold&apos;s uncredited &quot;Hands of a Stranger&quot;). Edmond T. Greville served as both screenwriter and director, shooting each scene in English first, then again in French, ensuring added sex appeal for the slightly longer Continental version. Mel Ferrer sadly contributes a somnambulistic performance in the central role, an acclaimed pianist irresistible to women but about to wed fiancee Louise (Lucile Saint Simon), only for his hands to come out badly damaged from a plane crash (the pilot is played by David Peel, recent Baron Meinster in Hammer&apos;s &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot;). The renowned surgeon Professor Volcheff (Sir Donald Wolfit) is swiftly engaged to work miracles for Orlac, whose recovery involves learning of the concurrent execution of strangler Louis Vasseur, becoming convinced that his repaired appendages formerly belonged to Vasseur. Choosing to simply give up on his career and the woman who loves him, he then finds himself targeted by Christopher Lee&apos;s second rate magician Nero, introduced after a lethargic opening half hour, calling on sexy assistant Li-Lang (Dany Carrel) to seduce Orlac and find out what he&apos;s running away from. Dany and Lucile offer such stunning pulchritude that Ferrer&apos;s absolute lack of passion remains baffling (he was married to actress Audrey Hepburn at the time), leaving all the dramatics to Lee&apos;s over the top theatrics and maniacal laughter, the only life that maintains audience interest. In trying to capitalize on the connection with the deceased strangler he hopes to drive Orlac insane or perhaps to murder, an unlikely blackmail scheme that involves Li-Lang to pose as Vasseur&apos;s widow. A superb supporting cast is wasted, Felix Aylmer, previously strangled by Lee as &quot;The Mummy,&quot; arrives during the final third as Louise&apos;s distinguished father, going to Scotland Yard to assuage fears that Orlac&apos;s hands are not his own. Sir Donald Wolfit&apos;s presence is thrown away as the surgeon, unlike Peter Lorre&apos;s obsessive turn in &quot;Mad Love,&quot; and a two minute cameo from Donald Pleasence comes at the 65 minute mark, his sculptor Graham Coates obviously intrigued by those fascinating fingers. Lee&apos;s role as tormentor is similar to Peter Lorre, merely a small time con artist with delusions of grandeur rather than a brilliant doctor, ably recreating the scene dressed up as the executed killer, complete with steel hooks in place of hands, but neither Mel Ferrer here nor James Stapleton in &quot;Hands of a Stranger&quot; earn the kind of sympathy that Colin Clive engendered in the 1935 version.",

The film shows how caring for one another can make a difference, but it&apos;s never sentimental and there&apos;s no tear jerking at all. \n\nThe story centres around A Tao, a housekeeper who cooks and cleans for film producer Roger, who is not married and travels a lot. When returning home from one of his travels from Hong Kong to mainland China, A Tao doesn&apos;t open the door. She has had a stroke and after her stay in the hospital, she moves to an old people&apos;s home. Roger visits her regularly and gradually they become closer. At the start of the movie they are employer and employee, at the end they are friends. \n\nDirector Ann Hui shows this process with small, symbolic scenes. When A Tao serves Roger his food in one of the first scenes, only one word is spoken, when she asks him to move something on the table to make room for the dish she has prepared. The contrast with another key scene, later on in the movie, is huge. After A Tao has recovered from the stroke, Roger takes her to the first screening of his new film and introduces her to movie stars as his godmother. Afterwards, they walk away hand in hand, chattering affectionately about the film business. \n\nA Tao visibly enjoys this party, and the attention she receives from her &apos;godson&apos;. This is just one of the examples of the wonderful acting by Deannie Yip, a famous actress in the Hong Kong film industry but unknown to the rest of the world. In this film, she seemingly effortlessly plays A Tao first as a humble servant, then as a physically handicapped patient and also as a coquettish lady. How wonderful it must have been for her to receive a &apos;best actress&apos;-award at the Venice Film Festival for her part as A Tao. \n\nThe film focuses on the relationship between Roger and A Tao, and the development of their mutual appreciation. Apart from that, not much really happens. There are some humorous little scenes that will make you smile, as well as some more emotional ones. This is a slow and low-profile film, to be appreciated by a typical art-house audience.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sommarlek&quot; (literal translation: &quot;summer play&quot; or &quot;summer frolic&quot;) is seen by many as the true beginning of director Ingmar Bergman&apos;s career. Abandoning his traditional, often unlikeable, male protagonists of his earlier efforts, in this film he casts a female lead to act out a story from his own youth. It was a brilliant maneuver that proved to be a huge, career-defining success as Bergman was now able to explore more sensitivity and sentimentality, not to mention aesthetic beauty, through the female viewpoint. And the actress herself, Maj-Britt Nilsson, does an amazing job of covering the entire spectrum of joy and despair.\n\nThe story begins on the stage of a ballet rehearsal, the night before the big show of Swan Lake. Our heroine &quot;Marie&quot; (Maj-Britt Nilsson) is 38 years old which in ballet terms is practically in the grave. Certainly in terms of emotion she is presented as almost a preserved corpse, beautiful but utterly drained of life. An accident shuts down rehearsal and she leaves to go home but takes an unexpected detour on a boat which takes her to an idyllic little island where she spent a summer of her youth 13 years prior.\n\nThis is where the magic of Maj-Britt Nilsson&apos;s acting shows itself. The youthful &quot;Marie&quot; is so thoroughly playful, happy and childish that I literally had to pause the film to check if it was really the same actress. It is. And immediately the suspense is set: how does such a happy-go-lucky young girl turn out to be the jaded painted relic we saw on the ballet stage?\n\nWhat follows is a love story that&apos;s almost ridiculous in its perfection, but that&apos;s the point. As Marie says, it feels like being inside a soap bubble. Bergman and his filming crew made excellent use of the sights of summer (even though the typical Swedish summer is barely 2-3 weeks long) to convey a fantasy in the natural world.\n\nUltimately the audience knows it must somehow return to the dark stage of the present, and so psychologically this cute love story has the air of a mystery all the way through. This is my favorite part of the film, the way it&apos;s implied that the love story will end, and thus there&apos;s no need for contrived conflicts and cartoonish peril. Yes, there are shadows of malice but these shadows are subtle. The screech of an owl (announcing the impending end of summer) accompanied by Marie&apos;s sudden inexplicable terror, and a shift in cinematography to a darker, more sinister look-this is the kind of subtle, artistic foreshadowing I&apos;m talking about.\n\nIn the last part of the movie there are some excellent monologues, all done in the quiet darkness of Marie&apos;s dressing room. Certain lines are so poetic you&apos;ll want to memorize them, such as &quot;It&apos;s like being a painted doll on strings. If you cry, the paint runs...&quot; And to me that&apos;s where the film, and Maj-Britt Nilsson, really deliver. The last line (which I won&apos;t ruin!) ends on a cryptic note which makes you want to watch the whole film again.\n\n&quot;Sommarlek&quot; is a great film, not just as a historical marker for Bergman&apos;s career but as a standalone work of cinema. I would compare it to the Max Ophuls masterpiece which would come 4 years later, &quot;Lola MontÃ¨s&quot; (1955). Both films give us a lavish epic focusing on a caged woman facing the memory her wild &amp; free past, but in this case the &quot;lavish epic&quot; is wonderfully contained on a tiny island over a few fleeting weeks of summer.",

      "reviewBody": "While transporting drums of the dangerous Trioxin gas, one of them falls from the army truck into a river. In the morning, the boy Jesse Wilson (Michael Kenworthy) is bullied by the older Billy (Thor Van Lingen) and Johnny (Jason Hogan) and he hides himself under a bridge nearby the cemetery. The two bullies find Jesse and they see the barrel. Then the bullies lock Jesse in a mausoleum and they decide to open the barrel, releasing the Trioxin and breathing the toxic gas. Meanwhile the grave robber Ed (James Karen) hires Joey (Thom Mathews) to help him to pillage the graves and they go to the cemetery in a van with Joey&apos;s girlfriend Brenda (Suzanne Snyder). Ed and Joey go to the mausoleum and Jesse is released and runs home. His sister Lucy Wilson (Marsha Dietlein) tells him to do the homework. Then the cable guy Tom Essex (Dana Ashbrook) arrives to fix the television and he recognizes Lucy from the high- school. Soon the Trioxin awakes the dead in the cemetery and the town is crowded with hordes of zombies. Ed, Joey and Brenda run to Jesse&apos;s house and team up with Lucy and Tom trying to survive to the brain eaters. \n\n&quot;Return of the Living Dead: Part II&quot; is a funny zombie cult movie. This sequel is a comedy with action, with good special effects and creepy zombies. There are the usual stupid attitudes from the characters but it is highly entertaining. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Volta dos Mortos Vivos - Parte 2&quot; (&quot;The Return of the Living Dead: Part II&quot;)",

This movie is more on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and Anchorman.\n\nThe chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it&apos;s nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or &quot;rom&quot; setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn&apos;t even control my laughter in a full cinema.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;m not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill&apos;s ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely recommend this one! Best comedy film I&apos;ve seen at the cinema in 2012.",

Unfortunately without knowing the background of the characters, I could not empathize at all. I told her &quot;the story seemed too much manipulated and I did not empathize it&quot;. She said she felt natural. Therefore, I strongly recommend seeing the first part before this one.\n\nVFX effects are amazing. Tokyo scenes in the late 1950&apos;s are recreated in detail. I first saw the river at Nihonbashi bridge without highway above it. Now the river is cleaner than the movie. Yes, the rivers of Tokyo in high economic growth period was that dirty.\n\nBy the way, the locale is set to Tokyo in 1959. In 1959, I was almost the same age with the children in this movie. That time, there was a radio drama series &quot;1, 1st street&quot; and a TV drama series &quot;Backstreet&quot;. Both dramas portrayed daily life at a backstreet in Tokyo. I was a kid in a local city, but was fascinated in the dramas with cordial atmospheres. The word &quot;ALWAYS&quot; in this movie title may imply to portray daily life too. But I feel every episode is too dramatically manipulated to be ALWAYS but ONE TIME. By the way the subject of the novel Chagawa chose for his masterpiece is good.",

The characteristic for communistic regime hierarchy of officers, in which anybody knows his/her place. Nobody wants to work for anybody else, everybody is disparaged by those who are higher than him.

The short time they spend together changes Shome&apos;s entire outlook to life and his own future. The beauty of the film lies in its exploring the key issues in the protagonist&apos;s life through a simple narrative, beautiful scenery and light hearted interplay between the characters. To borrow Robert Browning&apos;s phrase, at the end you are left with the feeling of, &quot;God&apos;s in His heaven - All&apos;s right with the world!&quot;",

The ensuing misadventures are VERY funny, particularly the attempts by hired hit-men Harlan and Marlon James, not-too-bright cousins played by William Hurt and Keanu Reeves."

I believe that in order to appreciate this film, you need to have an open mind and not take it so literaly. I&apos;ve read reviews of it in which the authors claim that not of the characters, or cars, or Nemos Sub, could work like they did. WELL DUH! It is a movie based on a comic book. It naturally wouldn&apos;t be for real. I wonder what these people take us for. The other great thing about this movie is the characters. Some reviews stated that people wouldn&apos;t understand this movie because the characters are not that new. That they&apos;ve been around for a while and no one will remember them. The only two characters that I didn&apos;t know were Allan Quatermain and Dorian Gray. But I would like to know more about them. So that in itself is good. It makes you want to know more about the characters. Bottom line... It is a really great film. Go see it with an open mind, and not take everything so literaly. You may find that you enjoy it. Don&apos;t trust all the bad reviews. You should see for yourself. LXG is a really good film"

      "reviewBody": "Fellas, do yourself a favor - if you have to see this, see it with your &quot;woman&quot; (by that I mean wife or very close significant other, not a first date for the love of Pete), and make sure she pays. You all know she wants to see it, and by the end you&apos;ll maybe even thank her for it. Obsessed is one of those movies that women love to watch in their PJ&apos;s on a Sunday afternoon with a pint of ice-cream when nothing else is on *except* for the trashiest piece of trash on TV. And make no mistake, Obsessed is such trash that it is a 3rd rate ripoff of Fatal Attraction, which many forget was *already* a rip-off on Clint Eastwood&apos;s Play Misty for Me. Here&apos;s what you need to know: nice business guy with lots of cake and a fine mansion and a super-fine wife and young tot gets derailed off of living in banality by a foxy-but-trouble type of girl who&apos;s working part time in the office.\n\nThat&apos;s it. No more explanation. If you can guess everything that the characters will do, or wont due to incompetence, then you&apos;re doing well. Obsessed makes no bones about being original, and in fact could be the precise template needed if anyone ever wanted to do a full-blown ZAZ-style parody on pscyho-chick movies. It takes itself so seriously that it&apos;s hard not to knock on it in most of the scenes - and it becomes further frustrating since out of the three main characters, one actor (Idris Elba) is actually very good, almost too good, for the material, and another (Ali Larter) fits in in her completely 1 1/2 dimensional role without much struggle. Only one, Beyonce, seems to be actually trying too hard to &quot;act&quot; and again gets in trouble as she did in Dreamgirls.\n\nThe direction is very slack- considering it&apos;s a TV guy who did it, maybe only TV according to his creds- and the writing is slack-ier. The development of characterization and plot moves along like a expertly crafted diarrhea, meaning that it never really stops from its trajectory, and it may be a little smooth going, but it also hurts trying to see it accomplish anything aside from pain. And yet, as far as painful cinema goes, it could&apos;ve been worse. It certainly has the grace to give us a gigantic cat-fight at the end that you&apos;d expect samurai swords. It&apos;s not campy enough to recommend, and by no means if you are a heterosexual male will you get much satisfaction out of it. Girls will giggle and be fine with stuff that is run of the mill, with a few jolting twists along the way.",

      "reviewBody": "Right before turning in, the girlfriend said that if I was still up working into the wee hours I should take a break and turn on the telly. Best in Show would be on and although she hadn&apos;t seen it, she&apos;d heard it got great reviews.\n\nI kept working and forgot the time. The telly was on but I ignored it. All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. &apos;We like the same things - soup, snow peas, talking - and not talking.&apos; I thought to myself &apos;what is this - some kind of weird porn movie?&apos; And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.\n\nI looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it: Christopher Guest aka Nigel Tufnel, the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.\n\nI made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie: the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture, and not surprisingly either it&apos;s garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one, but it&apos;s pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters. Still, it must be a kind of Woody Allen and Orion kind of thing: movies like this make the studio look good.\n\nOn to the movie: it&apos;s a riot, a bloody riot. It might not be your cuppa, but then OK - turn it off or watch something else. But there is so much in this one - it plays a bit like an Altman. Lots of hand-held too. And when you finally get to the show itself on comes Fred Willard and takes it away. He uses Jim Piddock as a foil - actually he uses almost everything as a foil. And if you think his portrayal is too much over the top, reflect on the fact it&apos;s supposedly a copy of an actual commentator at shows of this kind.\n\nThis type of movie is either extraordinarily difficult or admirably easy to make, and I suspect it&apos;s a bit of both. Some of the skits are just too much, and everywhere you turn the acting is inspired. One scene with I believe Posey in a pet shop is precious - and not only her work but the shop assistant&apos;s. Amazing stuff.\n\nMostly my sympathies went to Begley Jr who was the receptionist at the hotel. Meeting all these weird types and trying to remain accommodating and representative - it must be difficult if not impossible. There are some very weird characters in this one.\n\nAnd you may be asking yourselves &apos;watch a mockumentary about a dog show and its participants?&apos; And that&apos;s the whole point - it&apos;s hilarious; it&apos;s a riot.\n\nI give it an 11."

The music caught my attention more than anything else. There is a classic piece played on the piano by one of the main characters which I have since discovered was not written for the movie as I had first thought. I&apos;d like to track this piece down as it kept me watching the movie to the end. Some of the anime scenes have a haunting imagery to them which the music again complements well.",

Loved a lot of the new characters, especially Finn McMissile and the arrogant Italian car guy (whatever his name was). Liked Raoue Carole as well. I just had two major pet peeves with it: it focused on Mater. Mater already had his own little spin-off of &quot;Mater&apos;s Tall Tales&quot; which I love. A movie centered on him just didn&apos;t do it for me. Had it been on Lightning (like the first one) or any other character I would have been okay. It may have to do with the fact that I&apos;m no Mater fan. My second beef was Doc Hudson wasn&apos;t in it. I know why, I understand wanting to honor Paul Newman (whom I adored), hate to sound callous, but the show goes on. If he ended up with a different voice then so be it. Better yet, he could have been in it for a few seconds, and just not say anything at all. Fillmore&apos;s voice actor passed and he was still in it so to me there was no excuse not to have Doc in it. My two cents, of course.",

The constant air stunts and fighter pilots battling on the skies are very fascinating. The tight plot keeps me on edge all the time. I also like the portrayal of brotherhood among the soldiers. It&apos;s great that the film it&apos;s not too bloody given it&apos;s an action packed thriller. I enjoyed watching &quot;Red Skies&quot; a lot."

The dialogue contains plenty of unfittingly abusive words every so often, but you&apos;ve got to giggle over Flightplan&apos;s spoken line, which is incredibly campy: &quot;Robots. I can&apos;t sense robots.&quot; Leave it to the spaceship fights and &apos;bot blastings for your enjoyment. They&apos;re not great, but they&apos;re worth the movie alone. Who could ask for anything more? No other sci-fi saga, past or present, can dethrone or even match the legendary STAR WARS!",

Each animal saw and smelled all the death around him as he was dragged around in the mud, waiting his turn. The twitching bodies of those still not quite dead . . . too much. I realize that those people did it to feed and support themselves - but I will never forget those scenes. Maybe that was the point."

Stef Dawson&apos;s character &apos;Milly Piper&apos; could&apos;ve died after she first open her mouth as far as I&apos;m concerned, she&apos;s THAT bad. The quest to find a lost brother is their aim, except for Kelsey Grammer&apos;s Mason who is really trying to track down the elixir of life...bwah ha haaaa (twirls imaginary moustache). The main threat to their journey is hundreds upon hundreds of deadly spiders who appear to be made of black shiny leather and can hiss and squeak...Yes, you read that right...hiss and squeak. By all means, watch this, suspend all disbelief, let the film wash over you and drown in its ridiculousness. It&apos;s a real hoot, soon to be considered a classic amongst godawful movies that you can say &quot;Yes...I sat through that film and survived.&quot; Now go and enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "The blurb I had read about &quot;en face&quot; said it was supposed to be a love story about intense passion, so I was surprised when it actually was more of a suspense/thriller.  But once I settled into the chair and started getting into the story, I was happy to switch my expectation gears.  The story is about an amourous, but poor couple that inherits (from a complete stranger) the equivalent of a &quot;haunted mansion&quot; in the heart of Paris&apos; Montmartre district.  The house isn&apos;t really haunted, but it&apos;s creepy and the maid who works there is even creepier (in classic haunted house style, part of the terms of the inheritance are that the maid must be kept on, or they will lose the house).\n\nThe manner in which the maid is filmed and costumed make her out to be too much of a charicature to be taken too seriously.  Yet this stylistic quibble aside, I was gradually being drawn into the plot and was looking forward to what I hoped would be a dramatic, but interesting climax.  I knew I wasn&apos;t watching a great movie, but was hopeful that it would still be entertaining enough to warrant the price of admission.\n\nUnfortunately the ending pretty much blew it with an overly baffling turn of events riddled with annoying music and incessant cuts and edits. It made little sense and there were so many holes and unanswered questions in the plot that I left the cinema with one of those &quot;what the...?&quot; expressions on my face.  The film suffered from the writer&apos;s (or director&apos;s) desire to make a final statement about love, rather than just create a believable finale. Not good, but not horrible either (5/10)",

Yet the film is not a montage of &quot;talking heads.&quot; Instead, the interviews are layered on top of images of contemporary life in the village. The two elements of the film, interviews and images, fit together seamlessly. The cinematography deepens the emotion of the words. And the movie is filled with emotion. The fear that townspeople felt is palpable. The images and interviews truly convey an understanding of what the townspeople went through. I could actually feel why a young person would want to go face death and join the guerrillas. Yet fear is not the only emotion in the movie: there is also hope. The joy that the survivors experience in the midst of their scarred present is intensely hopeful. And one woman&apos;s discussion of overcoming her depression is deeply moving. It is clear that we have a lot to learn both from the townspeople of Cinquera. I thank Tatiana Huezo for bringing them to us, and adding her own profundity to the film.",

And then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped, hit, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play-acting. Other times it plainly isn&apos;t, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped. Instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to &quot;let go&quot;.\n\nEvery scene of this film reeks of misogyny (speaking as a straight, white, married man in his late 30&apos;s, not a teenage lesbian women&apos;s studies major with a chip on her shoulder, lest you get the wrong idea).\n\nPerhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Run and Kill is an excellent example of what the Chinese do so well - a violent revenge thriller, in the vein of MAN WANTED and RETURN ENGAGEMENT (both also starring SIMON YAM). Kent Cheung plays a mild-mannered man who accidentally involves himself in the murder of his wife when drunk at a nightclub one evening. When he sobers up and realizes what has happened, he goes to the police, headed by DANNY LEE, who find his tale somewhat hard to believe! He soon goes home to find the gang leader who wants his payment for the murder of his wife, and when he can&apos;t pay, gets beaten up for his troubles. The plot thickens from here on, but I wouldn&apos;t want to spoil it for you. Suffice to say there are a few nasty moments involving a lead pipe, and a burning child....you find yourself really rooting for the hero (?) of the piece as he comes up against the lunatic Simon Yam. This film is based on a true story, which makes it all the more gripping if you can stand the gore and violence on display. Unfortunately, this movie isn&apos;t available in the UK, but if you get the chance, it comes highly recommended.",

Funded by Random House Publishing, with that company having no idea that Moore is not just going to sign books, the all-world film-maker pulls no punches as he gets to the heart of corporation down-sizing just as some of the biggest money-makers in the U.S. start to have all-time record high profits. We see regular folks laid off by monsters like Pay Day (the candy bar company), Procter &amp; Gamble, General Motors, Johnson Controls and Pillsbury. National corporations leaving the U.S. to pay lesser fees to employees in third-world countries is explained in great detail and Moore even has a unique conversation with Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike (also the only CEO brave enough to verbally spar), and needless to say Moore comes out looking much better than his opponent. &quot;The Big One&quot; shows the lack of political choices for the general public (the film makes it blatantly clear that the Clinton/Dole race of 1996 was a no-win vote) as blue-collar, middle-class workers fall in the work-place due to the lack of government control on power-mad corporations that only look at the bottom line and constantly talk about competition in their industry (this makes the big-wigs look even sillier in reality). The main theme from &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; late during Moore&apos;s run of metropolitan areas ends up setting the overall tone of this exceptional documentary feature. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "China Heavyweight is beautifully-shot documentary about overcoming adversity and doing whatever it takes to become a champion.\n\nServing as a follow-up to Yung Chang&apos;s 2007 film Up in Yangtze, the Chinese-Canadian director takes his viewers back to China and introduces them to three men involved at a boxing academy in Southwest China. Qi Moxiang, is a state boxing coach who searches for raw talent in village schools and rural tobacco fields of the Sichuan province. A former boxer himself, Moxiang longs to have one more shot at victory after losing an Olympic qualifying match from a previous year. The younger boxers on the other hand, are Miao Yunfei and He Zongli. Chosen to go into elite training, both hope they won&apos;t spend their lives as tobacco farmers.\n\nHaving its Canadian premiere at the HotDocs film festival in Toronto, this film takes an observational approach into showing Coach Qi&apos;s dedication to the sport and the lives of two aspiring boxers who vie for a better life outside the village they grew up in.\n\nWhile three characters can be a handful to focus on, Chang does an excellent job in intertwining their stories and bringing them back together at the end of the film during Coach Qi&apos;s final match.\n\nBut with several intimate and personal scenes involving the characters and their families, having to shoot in such close settings isn&apos;t always easy.\n\n&quot;We tried to build trust and a relationship with the characters,&quot; said Chang, noting that he wanted to give the audience the vision that the film was &quot;almost in the mind of the subject&quot;.\n\nBut given that the documentary&apos;s subject is boxing, there&apos;s deeper meanings entwined in the film&apos;s narrative approach. While extremely personal, it successfully highlights the camaraderie between each individual and the struggles faced as they go away from home to take a shot at fighting for the glory of their country.\n\nAnd even though the summary of this movie may seem like any sports documentary about overcoming challenges in order to become a champion, it&apos;s interesting to see young individuals evolve into elite athletes from their humble village surroundings in the Sichuan province.",

The first part was entertaining to me, a simple but fun adventure movie, the second part was a rather boring affair to me - an attempt to make something significant but not really engaging, and in the context of the first half (adventure, romance) it just feels too much out of tune.",

I have since seen it a number of times and will continue to sit through whenever it&apos;s shown on TV. Steve McQueen, it&apos;s good to be in the same room as him, even if it is via the wonders of science. So enjoy the moment when you do see this film, or enjoy them again, if you have seen it, i would loved to have been on set with the great guy himself."

Nobody understands Camille, which leads to sad and often lonely moments. This film is beautifully written and directed. GaÃ«l Morel is a fine director who deserves a wide audience for his work. His leading actress Catherine Deneuve is impressive, but this is also the case with promising young actors as Dumerchez (who also played the lead in Morel&apos;s Le Clan) and Jolivet. On the soundtrack Beth Gibbons with the song Mysteries which brings back happy memories for someone who isn&apos;t there anymore. An English subtitled DVD is now available in Australia.",

      "reviewBody": "Actually, I wasn&apos;t expecting very much from Ouija. I thought it&apos;d be a another plain Asian horror movie like One Missed Call and Bangkok Haunted. Surprsingly, I found myself quite entertained, the movie could be one of those great Asian horror just like Ring and A Tale of Two Sisters.\n\nAt first the story doesn&apos;t seemed to be original, but there is much more too it than the &quot;ouija board&quot;. Toppel Lee, the director, doesn&apos;t focus on the game itself, but on the after effects of it.\n\nThe story does have some &quot;Asian horror&quot; clichÃ©s, such as the girl with the face covered with hair, but I guess that is just normal because that idea was brought by Ring and then adapted into almost all Asian horror movie like done in A Tale of Two Sisters.\n\nAll I can give now is much praise for the movie. The storytelling is told beautifully with flawless shots. The musical score builds up to an excellent scare and terrifying moments along with that beautiful cinematography.\n\nThe characters are not shallow. They are human, not just another character in a movie. Each character has their own story, though the movie does focus more around Judy Ann Santos and Jolina Magdangal, who I thought gave an excellent performance.\n\nThe supporting cast of the movie does deliver. Desiree del Valle and Iza Calzado were excellent, as always. The great Anita Linda gives one of the best chilling performance I&apos;ve seen even though her role is limited. The younger cast in the form of Rhian Ramos, Valerie Concepcion, Angela Ilagan and JC de Vera, also gives their best performances.\n\nOverall, Ouija is in the same level of Asian Horror Classics such as Ring, A Tale of Two Sisters and Kairo. The film will definitely deliver scare to you, I guarantee it!",

      "reviewBody": "I discovered surrealist cinema as an adult. Of course, there are such scenes and images in many films, but I saw the first complete surrealist movie as a grown up. It was &quot;Belle de jour&quot;, a film by Luis BuÃ±uel, whose work I knew since watching his &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; in my childhood. BuÃ±uel had gone a long way since 1928&apos;s &quot;Un chien andalou&quot;, made in France. He had gone into exile during the Spanish Civil War, first to the United States and finally to MÃ©xico, where he spent the rest of his life. But he made films in Europe now and then, and had regained his status as one of the masters of world cinema. Although he did not think much of his Mexican motion pictures, his masterpiece &quot;El Ã¡ngel exterminador&quot; is my favorite of all his films. He once complained that Mexican actors were not able to convey the spirit of the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot;, but what he did not take into consideration was that, if he made a film in MÃ©xico about the rich, he was dealing with something else, called &quot;creole oligarchies.&quot; And in this sense, this farce of the 1960s&apos; Latin American &quot;filthy rich&quot; is most accurate. Moreover, with his usual affectionate treatment of the bourgeois (something he rarely did with clergy, female characters, or street urchins), he created a most believable funny portrait of the Latino rich people, who do not know what is their origin, who they should &quot;pay tribute to&quot;, or where they are headed, unlike their European ancestors. Here, a group of those characters, born in MÃ©xico, gather for dinner after an opera performance, but when the time comes to leave the house of the Nobiles they cannot leave the room where they reunited for gossiping after meal. There is no apparent reason they cannot leave, but there they stay for days, going back to a primitive state in which their dearest &quot;discreet charm&quot; (euphemism, the rule of the game, as in Renoir&apos;s 1939 film) vanishes. And when they are set free, and go to a church to thank the Lord... well, BuÃ±uel sure knew how to make fun of them, with situations verging on the fantastic and funny lines of incoherent, silly or ridiculous dialogue. A wonderful movie, which is always fun to watch again, especially in a double bill with another gem, the last one BuÃ±uel made in MÃ©xico: &quot;SimÃ³n del desierto.&quot;",

I&apos;ve seen this film described as hysterical.  Perhaps some lives do function on a more fraught emotional plane than others and that rollercoaster ride ascends to great pleasures as well as sinking toward the inevitable depths that tangibly fierce existences must face.\n\nWhat a talent Collard was.    Perhaps this would have been his finest moment had he lived.  Somehow I feel that his consumate talent was just flowering when his body finally succumbed to his illness.  Technically it is competent rather than outstanding, yet there are some  scenes that have been arranged beautifully.  However, the true magic in this film lies in its restricted narrative.  All emotions are allowed to express themselves freely.  The shots are relentless in their gaze.  Collard&apos;s character makes the choice to live and to love, within the context of what life has in store for him. Where some cinema pontificates and emotionally rapes the audience, this film priviliges the viewer.   We see non-hegemonic cinematic bravery and an engagement with freedom, and how that leaves one raw and damaged.  Yet each day alive is a gift.  We are fortunate indeed to share Collard&apos;s gift within this film and I urge those who have not seen it to do so."

      "reviewBody": "No science-fiction library is complete without this 1954 classic, probably the best of the mutant creature craze. Sure, the special effects have long been eclipsed by digital, but the suspense holds up as LA mobilizes to defeat the giant killer ants in a battle of the sewers. The opening scenes are among the best of any era. I don&apos;t know how director Douglas got little Sandy Descher to emulate wide-eyed speechless shock, but from that moment on the tension rarely lets up. Then too, her single word eruption in the van may be the single scariest moment and a genuine inspiration on somebody&apos;s part. I guess it takes a big man to defeat big ants and thank goodness James Arness has switched to our side since menacing the North Pole in The Thing (1951). He, Whitmore, and Gwenn prove to be great pest exterminators though their methods are a little unorthodox, while poor pretty Joan Weldon sort of tags along after the guys in typical 50&apos;s style. Note the many nice touches from both the producer and director-- the well-stocked press conference, the army units deploying in the background, the humorous aside from the ugly guy in the hospital. These are the kind of additions that turn a good movie into a memorable one. It&apos;s certainly one I&apos;ve remembered fondly since its enthusiastic 1954 reception, and so will you if you haven&apos;t seen it."

      "reviewBody": "Boasting one of the most outlandish titles of the giallo genre, Sergio Martino&apos;s Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key is yet another loose adaptation of one of Edgar Allen Poe&apos;s most famous titles, The Black Cat. Like most Poe adaptations, the film shares little with its source material, apart from the presence of the titular black cat, here named Satan. While it is chocked full of narrative stumbles and frustrating red herrings, Martino&apos;s refusal to bend to the genre rules of the giallo makes Your Vice an extremely interesting entry into the genre, avoiding being bogged down with drawn-out set pieces and mind-bending visuals, and instead focusing on the psychological - and physical - interplay between its two leads.\n\nBored writer Oliviero (Luigi Pistilli) spends the majority of his time throwing drug and alcohol-fuelled parties for the local hippies, and enjoys mentally and physically abusing his long- suffering wife Irina (Anita Strindberg) in front of them. When a young student is brutally murdered on the night she had arranged to meet Oliviero, the wife-beating pig naturally becomes the prime suspect and withdraws into a state of deep paranoia at his labyrinthine mansion. When their maid also shows up dead, Oliviero and Irina hide the body just before the arrival of his niece Floriana (Edwige Fenech). Floriana is a confident and wise young woman, and hatches a plan with Irina to deal with her abusive husband. But not all is as it seems, and just who is the handsome grey-haired man lurking behind every corner?\n\nFar from your average giallo, Your Vice... doesn&apos;t subvert the genre but frequently surprises. The plot and ludicrous climax, like most gialli, seem not be taken from the yellow-covered pulp fiction they are normally adapted from, but something akin to an episode of Scooby- Doo. While that may seem like a criticism, it really isn&apos;t - it&apos;s the type of insanity that makes these movies so much fun to watch. Bolstered by a fantastic score by Bruno Nicolai and lavish cinematography by Giancarlo Ferrando, they are nonetheless overshadowed by Fenech, surely one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen. Floriana is a no-nonsense, well-travelled lady, and just when you think you have her worked out, the film throws in a surprising, if in no way believable, twist. It may not be remembered as Martino&apos;s best entry into the genre (1973&apos;s Torso is certainly up there), but Your Vice... throws in enough twists and turns to keep it consistently entertaining and occasionally disturbing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;It&apos;s a wonder I haven&apos;t abandoned all my ideals, they seem to be absurd and impractical. Yet, I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.&quot; - Anne Frank\n\nAnne Frank wrote those words while locked in an attic with her family, hiding from the Nazis who were Hell-bent on killing them. Some may have said that this idea was insane given the circumstances, but I am naive enough to think that it takes just as much energy to be nice to someone as it is to be cruel. A drop of human kindness makes just as much of an impact as a drop of malice.\n\nI thought of Anne Frank&apos;s statement all through Jennifer Arnold&apos;s lovely documentary A Small Act which chronicles a small act of kindness by one person that besets a lifetime of joy for many other people who might have perished. The movie tells the story of Chris Mburu, a Kenyan who was born dirt poor in an African tribe. As a boy he made good grades in Primary school - which is free in Kenya - but would not have been able to attend Secondary School because his family could not afford it. Fortunately, he made good grades in Primary School and had his secondary education payed for by a Swedish woman that he had never met who donated $15 a month to pay for his education. Through this act of kindness, Mburu was able to attend secondary school where he excelled, then went on to the University of Nairobi and eventually Harvard Law. Today, he is a Human Rights Commissioner at the United Nations.\n\nMburu was so gratified by the woman&apos;s gift that he began a foundation in her name - The Hilda Back Foundation - to help young African children get a chance at an education. The center of the film is how Chris Mburu gets to meet, for the first time, the woman who made his life possible. Her name is Hilda Back, 85 years-old, a short woman with a kindly face and boundless energy. As a child she had to be sent to Sweden from her native Germany to escape being sent to the death camps by the Nazis. Her family would perish in the Holocaust and Back would remain in Sweden becoming a school teacher. She felt that her small contribution was an act of kindness. She never dreamed how far it would reach.\n\nAs we follow Chris&apos; inevitable meeting with Hilde Back, we are also introduced to several children who are in Primary School, who are trying to get the grades to be able to get on a scholarship program to make it to secondary. They are Caroline, Ruth and Kimani. Their families have almost nothing and no way to simply pay for secondary school. Getting these scores means their very lives, especially for young girls in a country that offers them few choices.\n\nAs these kids end their term in Primary school they are given tests to see if they qualify for the scholarship and that makes up some of the most tense and nerve-wracking moments I have ever seen in a movie. I never thought that awaiting test scores - test scores! - could create such suspense. The kids wait to be texted the scores, and wait and wait and wait and wait. Further drama is added by the fact that, due to a presidential election, the grades will be delayed.\n\nI had never considered anyone&apos;s education being a matter of life or death for their family. For these young people - especially the girls - this is all or nothing. Either they will succeed or they will perish in an environment that has nothing positive to offer them. I was especially worried about Caroline, who&apos;s family doesn&apos;t own any land. What options does she have if the test scores don&apos;t measure up? Their fates lie in the hands of those checking their scores. Those outcomes, I must leave for you to discover.\n\n&quot;A Small Act&quot; is as touching and lovely and thrilling as any movie that I can imagine. It argues the value of a great documentary by presenting the kinds of people and events that no screenwriter could ever dream of. When Hilde comes to Kenya, she is greeted like a hero with loving arms and ceremonial garb and it is a moment more heart-wrending than anything I can remember.I don&apos;t want to sound like a feel-good greeting card, but as I watched Chris and Hilde meet, I thought of the roots of Hilde&apos;s kindness. They reached out to Chris who became a scholar, then made his mark at the United Nations working in human rights? How may people&apos;s lives did he touch? If these kids make the grades and go to college and follow successful careers, will they touch other lives? How far does a small act of kindness go? Like a ripple of the ocean, Hilde&apos;s contribution goes out and out and out. It all comes from this woman who, in spite of everything, believed that people are really good at heart."

      "reviewBody": "If someone told me &quot;hey, watch this movie about a haunted sauna, its a really scary horror movie!&quot;.. I guess I&apos;d stay as far away from the movie as possible. Luckily I saw some pictures of this Finnish movie and they looked really great.\n\nEveryone looking for a horror movie should stay away from this. Its pretty laughable that so many people focus on the sauna and some ghosts in this movie as typical horror clichÃ©s while the director works so obviously on making every single piece and image in this movie a symbol for guilt.\n\n&quot;Sauna&quot; or &quot;Filth&quot; (which is the far more fitting title referring to a statement by one of the Russian soldiers in this movie) is placed after the Russian/Swedish war around 1600 when a group of Russian and Swedish soldiers are setting for the new borders. The opening of the movie with the drawing of borders in blood and then the first shots of water turning red already indicate where this movie is going. Everything is carried by some great cinematography and the lead characters, 2 brothers of a very different kind. One is Knut, a mapmaker with high goals, the other is Erik, a soldier with a grim past who has his problems adjusting to the new peace.\n\nErik constantly looking for trouble soon gets the group of soldiers into problems when messing with a family. The town the group soon finds in the middle of a swamp becomes a clear symbol of Erics previous atrocities with as many inhabitants as victims on Erics list, a strange girl reminding them of recent wrongdoings (also involving a sauna) and animals and people who clawed out their eyes. The whole issue of not being able to face your past is present throughout the movie that is more like a fable. There is plenty of interesting historical information as well as philosophical dialog including the story about the king and filth or the thoughts if hell is just a place that god turned his back on. The place is soon presented and the irony is that yet everyone is fighting for the land soon there is a place that no one wants to take but rather wants to give to his enemy.\n\n&quot;Sauna&quot; is full of these abstract images and the finale is far from a clear resolution. After all the director clearly tries to make the viewer have his own thoughts. Actually I am still working on figuring the closing images out but however this is a damn interesting and different movie with great cinematography, acting and an interesting setting. There sure are some horror elements in this movie, but I&apos;d rather consider this a mix of art-house movie and drama and its definitely worth giving a chance.",

Vishal and Hero become entwined in an unforeseen way, and together they defeat Khanna.\n\nThis movie is ridiculous beyond compare, and is so slapstick that is hard to watch at times. Arbaaz Khan plays the straight guy well, but Salman Khan&apos;s role is so silly that it&apos;s hard to find sympathy for him. Mukerji doesn&apos;t appear enough to give a quality performance. The premise (which I won&apos;t give away) was truly great, but the presentation of it was truly terrible. Really, the only good part was watching the real- life brothers play opposite each other, and even that couldn&apos;t raise this movie to anything beyond mediocre.",

If the story of a vacation trip to Italy, won in a cheesy talent contest, and organized by a troupe of happy-go-lucky (and notoriously broke) young musicians, won&apos;t hold your attention, then perhaps the nauseatingly repetitive instrumental tune of &quot;Happy Jose&quot; will do the trick?\n\nThe 2 extra stars (if 1 is the lowest rating) are for the vibrant colors and the familiar faces of Germany&apos;s Golden Age of Entertainment. Sorry, but other than that, there is nothing positive to say about this movie. My suggestion: Skip this silly yarn and save your time for something, ANYTHING, else to watch!",

      "name": "A beautiful film about seeing with your heart, not your eyes",
      "reviewBody": "This is a lovely, almost-forgotten little RKO weepie from the 40&apos;s. It boasts touching performances from it&apos;s two leads, Dorothy McGuire and Robert Young, and a fine supporting turn by the always good Herbet Marshall.\n\n&apos;Enchanted Cottage&apos; has a real message. This is a film about seeing with your heart, not your eyes. Laura Pennington (McGuire) and Oliver Bradford (Young) learn to do so while cast under the magic spell of the &apos;enchanted cottage&apos; they are inhabiting. It seems a hokey concept on paper, but this film really works.\n\nLaura is a homely maid who looks as if she is going to spend her days as a spinster. She takes on a job at a pretty cottage owned by a dour old widow. Oliver Bradford originally wanted the cottage as a honeymoon location for him and his soon-to-be bride. However, Oliver was called to war a day before their wedding. He is disfigured and scarred as a result, and upon arriving home, his fiancÃ© expresses disgust (although we never see it) at his changed appearance. Crippled, bitter and lonely, he takes the cottage as a single man. The kind-hearted, yet plain, Laura helps him in his loneliness, as she too knows what it feels like to be judged on looks alone.\n\nThey eventually decide to marry out of convenience. But the spell of the enchanted cottage starts to work on them on their wedding night, as they realise the true love and affection they harbour for each other, a love that goes past face value and transports them into another realm.\n\nIt is a tender love story. McGuire is never anything but convincing as the downtrodden yet kind Laura; she impressed me a lot more here than in her Oscar-nominated work for &apos;Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement&apos;. All the time throughout watching the film I was thinking of her as a perfect actress for &apos;Jane Eyre&apos;. She certainly could play the plain, ordinary girl well, with emotional depth and understanding. Indeed, the relationship between the once-handsome but now-scarred Oliver and the homely, unwanted maid Laura is reminiscent of the Jane-Rochester relationship.\n\nThe widow seems to subscribe to the English novel theory too; her stopped clock at the time of her husband&apos;s death is very &apos;Miss Havisham&apos; from &apos;Great Expectations&apos;.\n\nMarshall is great, giving his usual understated performance as the blind composer who cannot &apos;see&apos; with his eyes, but can feel with his heart and his brain.\n\nA great musical score accompanies the scenery well, and appropriately dark cinematography complements the darker points of the story too. This was a war-time pic, and once again we are being shown the harsh realities of war through the disabled figure of Oliver. Still, this is more of a love story than propaganda.\n\nThis was made by the cash-strapped RKO studio, and today it is little-known. Apparently finding this film is hard, but here in Australia the ABC free-to-air network plays it regularly. I view myself as lucky.\n\nThis a tearjerker, and a beautiful romance story. Keep the tissues nearby.\n\n8/10.",

His first mission takes him to Paris where he is almost stymied in his efforts by a young blonde woman named &quot;Genevieve Laffont&quot; (Emma Danieli) who unknowingly warns his target of his attack. However, having completed his errand he then ventures to Geneva where, once again, he is almost prevented from carrying out his assignment by the same woman. Having now become extremely suspicious, he then forces Genevieve to accompany him to Athens in order to keep a close eye on her. What he doesn&apos;t know is that his movements have been closely monitored and she is now the least of his worries. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was an okay sequel to &quot;SuperSeven Calling Cairo&quot; with a better plot but somewhat hampered by mediocre acting all around. Along with that, several of the action scenes seemed much too scripted cheapened the overall effect. In any case, while this was certainly not a great spy movie by any means, I thought it was adequate for the time spent and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Fireball",
      "reviewBody": "Rather than Fireball: Muay Thai Dunk, this could have been more aptly titled as Firebrawl: Anything Goes, and I mean that in a nice way. We know enough of how sports and martial arts can coexist in movies, either in comical fashion like Stephen Chow&apos;s Shaolin Soccer, or played in a more deadpan, idol-movie like manner with the Jay Chou vehicle Kung Fu Dunk. Joining their ranks is this latest action film directed by Thanakorn Pongsuwan, which fuses an illegal underground basketball league, and Muay Thai fighting.\n\nFor those who want to organize their own tournament, here are the extremely simple rules as explained in the movie. It&apos;s your standard 5 on 5 basketball on a full length court, except that when the whistle blows, you can brawl with your opponent immediately, which makes it something like a WWE Royal Rumble, only faster and more brutal. To win, you still have to put the ball into your opponent&apos;s goal/basket (it&apos;s still basketball after all), but it only takes one dunk to win. Either that, or the team with the last man standing will be the victor. Killing your opponent is allowed, but only within the court (anything outside equals to punishment for the team), but there&apos;s no replacement players allowed as you progress through the stages. Which means survivors get to split more cash between them, but suffer from numerical disadvantage. Weapons are optional too.\n\nWhich makes the film perfect as an all out actioner, and Pongsuwan doesn&apos;t think twice about indulging the audience into detailed, well executed fights which take precedence over a decent game of basketball. While watching the film I felt it was a throwback to the 80s Bloodsport type of movie with gladiators battling in an arena, sans plot and character development, where the focus is to let the fists and feet do most of the talking. That said, the fight sequences were nicely shot and tightly choreographed, though it seemed more like an all-out street brawl than sticking to Muay Thai principles. Fans of hard-hitting action will definitely appreciate the ring-side seat to all of the action here, which is relentless in pace and powerful in execution.\n\nStory-wise, it tells of the tale of Tai (Preeti Barameeanat), who has recently been released from prison because twin brother Tan got him out of jail by raising required funds for bribery, but at the price of fighting for his life in a coma at the hospital. Tai learns from Tan&apos;s main squeeze Pang (Khanutra Chuchuaysuwan), who provides a cursory and unnecessary romantic angle, that Tan often got himself badly knocked up, and discovers that his twin was actually knocked comatose by an opponent in a Fireball tournament. So like a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, Tai adopts Tan&apos;s identity, and finds himself looking for a team to join for the tournament, seeking revenge.\n\nEnter Boss Den (Phutharit Prombandal), who recruits Tai&apos;s Tan into his Fireball team, led by captain and best fighter of the lot Zing (9 Million Sam, yes you read that right!), with Muk (Kumpanat Oungsoongnern), K (Anuwat Saejao) and teenager IQ (Kannut Samerjai) as the rag-tag, hastily assembled team with trust issues amongst one another, and personal issues, each from the doldrums of society, mercenaries for hire if you like, eyeing that prize money at the end of the rainbow in order to lift their lot. Throw in some match-fixing potential, which is de-facto in any underground fights, and nasty opponents with no qualms for un- sportsmanship behaviour, and you&apos;re all set for a non-stop action film where the drama in between becomes an excuse to glue the multi-faceted fight scenarios together. One of the best involves a training sequence where the boys play a friendly in and around a narrow and cramped apartment block, resembling a parkour-yamakasi piece.\n\nGiven knowledge that a prequel will be made, I can&apos;t help but to think that this film could end up as the &quot;middle&quot; movie, since it ended the way it did with doors opened for a sequel, and of course the story of Tan provides ample room for scenes before the opening shot here. The players too are likely to be similar for the prequel, and it could follow John Woo&apos;s A Better Tomorrow where you can bring back the key actor from the excuse that we&apos;re looking at the twin / likeness resembling relative, which this film had all set up, and set subsequent movies back in time too.\n\nThat said, as a basketball-type movie, Fireball would not muster any merit for lay-ups and slam dunks. But as an action film, then yes, it will satisfy any action junkie who misses the good old days of no holds barred fights, multiplied by the number of players on the court all happening at the same time.",

      "reviewBody": "This third movie version of KÃ¤stner&apos;s delightful novel is a bit of an embarrassment.  Filming it as a contemporary piece in 1974 (rather than going back to the 1930s and making it as a period film) was an understandable but problematic decision by the film makers.  The 1955 version did not have such a problem, the required adaptations were then rather minor.\n\nBut society had moved on since then in Germany and in particular the life style of the rich and the poor and the tensions between them had undergone a complete upheaval; and some of these tensions are very much at heart of KÃ¤stner&apos;s novel.  Thus to place the story in 1974 some changes to story lines and characters were needed.  For example, the pennyless and unemployed academic Dr. Hagedorn (the romantic lead) would not ring true in 1974 and was consequently replaced with car mechanic Boris Dorfmeister; this was one of the less contentious changes, although I would not have chosen a blue collar profession for him.  More problematic than Boris was the creation of the character of Titus, a completely failed attempt to replace the Kesselhut character (a butler) with something really modern; it was doomed to fail because the character Titus replaces is meant to be old-fashioned and living in the past, and Titus is the complete opposite - removing that aspect from the story leaves the relationship between the three men of the title unbalanced.\n\nIn the final result, all the elements that were designed to be hip in 1974 (like the collection of pinball machines) stick out like sore thumbs now, and make this film look much more dated than the 1955 version.",

This movie is a great movie about jelousy of a mother, that is scared that her children might love someone else as their second mother, and gives such a hard time to that person. And in the other hand, you see that young lady, in love (with the father of those kids), that forgives everything that has been done to her. She was called a bitch a couple of times (the dog scene with Ana, and when she brings the kids at Jackies, and Ana has make up). Was ignored, and even lost her job for those kids. And she forgives all of this, and tryes to like everyone. The world sure would be perfect if everyone would be this way. The problem is that the world has too many Jackies, and not enough Isabels. \n\nIf you are someone that likes to cry, and cry. Watch it. Is one of the sweetes movie ever, talking about peoples feelings, fears, and happynes. Great!",

This is documentary provides a great opportunity to learn the truth behind all of mythology that has been built up around Jeanette Maier specifically and the world&apos;s oldest profession generally. It presents an honest sympathetic portrait of the often untold human side of prostitution. The film also exposes us to honest, folksy, highly entertaining personality of Maier herself beyond the simplistic media picture that has been painted of her (and in the made-for-TV movie of her life). She presents a powerful case that it would be better for other states to follow Nevada lead and decriminalize prostitution. The documentary is very well-done and supported with family movies and FBI wiretap audio. While some of the speculation that the famous DC Madam Deborah Palfrey didn&apos;t commit suicide and was actually murdered seems to be both conspiratorial and unnecessary, the film is mostly quite down-to-earth and fair-minded. This is wonderful film for exposing people to the complex realities behind prostitution that is often either glamorized or demonized.",

What stood out in my mind after watching the film was the slow motion shots of participants carrying barbed wire. It is done very much in a style that doesn&apos;t belong in a documentary but more in an action or horror film. I actually have to applaud the director for this because it really adds a sense of excitement to what we&apos;re seeing. As a pro wrestler myself I thought I&apos;d hate the film, but to be honest with you although I hate the subjects (no doubt in my mind that they should get professional training and sometimes professional help) I found the film fascinating and if anything too-short. It was often funny and while I could watch everything my girlfriend kept turning away. Well worth the money!",

I don&apos;t remember too much about it other than it was exceptionally well shot, had some A-list talent in the cast, and it reminded me of my time at the local raceway. \n\nIt&apos;s a bit of a slow movie, some drama that may or may not have taken liberty with Shirley Muldowney&apos;s real story, and overall a bit of a sleeper of a film. I don&apos;t recall it getting a lot of promotion on TV before it hit cable, and to be honest I don&apos;t recall it ever playing in the local theatres. But it was a decent enough movie to see once or twice.\n\nThe 60s and 70s was a time when the women&apos;s movement was trying to re-assert female participation in what had become largely a male only world. The film shows some of the sexist barriers she faced, and her interpersonal struggles with her own crew and competition. \n\nI can&apos;t say I was a big drag racing fan, and I didn&apos;t know too much about her until I saw the movie. The film helped bring her to the fore front for a brief amount of time to non-drag racers (though you did hear about her on occasion on the radio).\n\nThe film itself has that mid-range budget feel. It&apos;s a bit raw, but still has a good professional gloss to it.\n\nCheck it out."

      "name": "Kitano&apos;s very different yakuza film",
      "reviewBody": "Takeshi Kitano&apos;s yakuza related trilogy consists of Violent Cop, Boiling Point and Sonatine. All these films are very different together, but they still share the usual elements of Kitano: Violent Cop is the bleakest, Boiling Point is the funniest and also oddest and Sonatine is like the combination of these two previous films, and Sonatine is also the greatest in the trilogy and also one of Kitano&apos;s most beautiful and greatest films. Boiling Point is very comic, but has also some Kitano elements of beauty and peace that we could see in his forthcoming films like Sonatine and Hana-Bi. Boiling Point tells the story of a baseball team and its relationship with the local ruthless yakuza gang. When couple of the team members decide to get a gun and fight some justice to the situation, we meet Kitano&apos;s character, a little criminal, who also has troubles with the yakuza. Kitano&apos;s character in this film is the most perverse and twisted I&apos;ve ever seen! What follows is tragic and comic happenings as these tragicomic people try to get rid of the greedy and exploiting yakuza criminals, and stay alive at the same time.\n\nThere are many fine elements in this film, and this is pretty close to Sonatine, as both films have peaceful and incredibly beautiful scenes involving sea and flowers. The comic elements are very black and it is easy to see that Kitano was a comedian before starting his masterful directing career. His humor is often cynical, ironic and very personal. Just remember the scene at the bar, for instance! Kitano&apos;s humor demands brains to be fully understood and it is never as easy to laugh at and enjoy as some Jim Carrey farce (nothing against Jim, though). But Boiling Point is definitely not a mere comedy, it is a Japanese yakuza story with comical elements. The yakuza is presented here as stupid and childish bunch of criminals, who have to prove themselves that they are bad guys and worth respecting. There is a brilliant scene involving flowers and two machine guns, as Kitano and his pal decide to finish the miserable life of one yakuza team! In Kitano&apos;s films, usually guns are for men like extended penis: so important in order to &quot;be someone.&quot; Violence is usually the only way Kitano&apos;s characters are able to communicate together. \n\nThe elements of beauty are always heart stoppingly effective in Kitano&apos;s art, and the scene at the flower field is very fantastic and memorable. And this was only the beginning as we witnessed the beauty and power of films like Sonatine and Hana-Bi couple of years later. Takeshi Kitano is simply one of the greatest artists I know, and his cinema is as unique as cinema itself was in its birth, over 100 years ago. There is no comparison for his films, they are so personal and come straight from the heart of this man.\n\nBoiling Point is not Kitano&apos;s greatest film, but still more than noteworthy. It is tragic, funny, exciting and challengingly symbolic at the same time, and thus as personal as Kitano&apos;s masterpieces. There are many great scenes and acts committed by the characters, and perhaps the only flaw in here is that the film is little too long and slow at the end part of the film. But once the end scene comes, it is again something we could expect from Kitano, and is pretty similar to Sonatine&apos;s finale.\n\nBoiling Point deserves 8/10 rating as a very interesting piece of Kitano cinema, and this is a hint of what was to come from this man couple of years later!",

      "name": "A leaden comedy that runs through a tired rehash of the Police Academy formula by transplanting it to a submarine",
      "reviewBody": "Unscrupulous Admiral Malice (Ned Beatty) is pressured by defense secretary Neighbor to move up the stealth submarine project the Sub Standard despite it not being read leading malice and military contractor Wedgewood to arranged for the sub to be tested with an ill equipped crew captained by a disgraced submarine captain who has fears of water and tight spaces.\n\nGoing Under is a 1991 submarine movie spoof made in the same vein as Warner Bros. Police academy movies down to the fact co-writer Randolph Davis would go on to write Police Academy: Mission to Moscow and Michael Winslow makes a brief supporting performance as an unnamed reporter character. Originally filmed under the title Dive!, the movie supposedly did have a few test engagements in theaters before Warner Bros. Ultimately decided to release the movie directly to video with the film largely having fallen into obscurity since. There&apos;s really not all that much to say other than like many of the Police Academy follow-ons Going Under feels very tired and without much punch to the material.\n\nIn the opening where we&apos;re introduced to some very broad satire about the military industrial complex that somehow gets into a military meeting staged like an episode of Mr. Rogers&apos; Neighborhood, the movie does get the odd chuckle here and there particularly from Bill Pullman&apos;s introduction as Biff Banner whose backstory of disgrace of beaching his submarine is mildly amusing, but as talented an actor as Pullman is even he can&apos;t support leaden material. The movie runs into an issue of making its central submarine funny and despite the Sub Standard having a ramshackle nature it doesn&apos;t offer all that much for comedic possibilities with the extended cast largely more confusing than legitimately funny and this is despite having funny people like Wendy Schaal of The &apos;Burbs and American Dad or Chris Demetral of Dream On making up the core cast. The Sub Standard when you compare it to what was done with The Big Bus or the planes in Airplane! Just feels lacking in solidly placed gags and instead just relies on a lot of mugging and noise to make up for the shoddy script.\n\nGoing Under goes under with very few laughs to justify itself even at an anemic premise of 80 minutes. I would say that Going Under is the last gasp of that particularly wave of that style of comedies, but Police Academy: Mission to Moscow would come out a mere 3 years later.",

The story concerns a bar owner who thinks his wife is cheating on him.  He hires a sleazy private investigator to find out, and when he learns the truth, he wants them dead.  Trouble is, things get kind of complicated when a murder occurs.  The film creates a palpable feeling of tension, where you don&apos;t know what to expect next.  Half the fun of this film is trying to figure out what will happen.  A true testament of the well sturctured nature of the film, is the fact that there are only four main characters, and they hold your attention till the very end.  And in traditional film noir fanfare, all of these characters have some sort of sordid business to attend to.  The Coens drew on their experiences on Blood Simple and made the similar, but very different, Fargo.   Watch Blood Simple for a good old fashioned film noir that will keep you guessing.",

Considering the film&apos;s definite Rocky formula you&apos;ll probably be a step ahead of the story at every turn, but it&apos;s well-directed, acted with such great conviction, and has a finale so powerful and moving that you almost have to go along for the ride. A compelling and gripping story of will and determination. ***"

      "reviewBody": "Another in the line of 70&apos;s hammer horror, Asylum is yet again a gloriously camp and cliched horror flick complete with manic characters, incredibly OTT acting, mansion/haunted castle type locations, and of course, fog.\n\nAsylum follows a young new qualified psychiatrist called Dr Martin, dryly played by a very young Robert Powell. He&apos;s applying for a job at an asylum and the interview is a far more bizarre one than any applicant for a new position would be used to.\n\nHe is greeted by Dr Rutherford, who appears to be the chairman figurehead of the asylum, who will interview him to establish his suitability.\n\nHowever, it turns out there is a twist here, because in order to get the new job, Dr Martin is told he must successfully identify who is Dr Starr, the head of the institution. Simple you might think. Unfortunately Dr Starr is now a patient after attacking Rutherford and paralysing him from the waist down. Martin will be given a tour of &apos;upstairs&apos; by Reynolds, the asylum orderly, and be taken round each case in order to see if he can identify which one really is Starr.\n\nThis leads to compendium style stories as we look back into the past of each patient - which one of these stories is actually true?\n\nIt must be said the whole cast appear to be having a whole heck of a lot of fun, and star turns from the likes of Patrick Magee, Peter Cushing, Brit Ekland and Charlotte Rampling ensure there&apos;s a quality behind the lunacies.\n\nDaft in places? Of course! Archaic? Without a doubt! Fantastic fun and satisfying? Indeed!\n\nWell worth seeing."

From the fierce fighting in Danzig, to the struggles along the Vistula, Warta and Bug rivers, to the Siege of Warsaw, the viewer can get an instructive understanding of how devastating the German advance was on the Polish forces.  The combat footage, shot by the famed Kriegsberichter and their cameramen, is absolutely first-rate, and it set the standard for all other combatants&apos; efforts in this genre during the war.  Compared with the American &quot;Battle for San Pietro,&quot; for example, the footage in &quot;Feldzug in Polen&quot; is much better in terms of the cameramen capturing dramatic moments. Good editing is another highlight.  Succinctly stated, this film is a military buff&apos;s delight.\n\nIn addition to the German-language edition, there was an English-language version of &quot;Feldzug in Polen.&quot;  And those who enjoy this film will also enjoy &quot;Sieg im Westen.&quot;",

Thus must say the two male leads has successfully delivered performances which torched my views on what constitutes &quot;good acting&quot;.\n\nOverall, The Son piqued my interest enough to want to hunt down other Dardenne Bros pics. Being new to their works, the extremely voyueristic shots in this film revealed previously undetectable character depths, with such humanistic intuition, it was uncannily astonishing.\n\nPity the dizzying cinematography made me all tipsy(my seat was very much infront). The film could arguably have done with some judicious trimming as well. But that may be due to my comparatively lower tolerance for such glacial paced works. But agree with you&apos;all that the abrupt end achieved the right note of hopefulness. Its openness was a very nice touch indeed.\n\nTo be fair, I think I would need more time to digest this film on tv. It is my belief that the wozzy nature of &quot;handheld&quot; flicks often play better in an intimate home setting than in a cinema, especially when viewed from unfavourable theatre vantage points like mine.\n\nAn acquired taste though The Son has been, I acknowledge its a very prized find. It at least has succeeded pointing me in a whole new direction of film appreciation."

      "reviewBody": "I was lucky enough to see this film due to the efforts of the folks at the Second Run DVD company who recently arranged a retrospective of MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³&apos;s films in London, at which the director was in attendance.\n\nWhat is critical about this movie (the first in a series of six following gravediggers Pepe and Kapo) is that it proves that JancsÃ³ was not a one-note director as many have claimed. His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.\n\nIt comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous JancsÃ³ film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord&apos;s Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described JancsÃ³&apos;s cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso&apos;s style is remarkably protean.\n\nThe reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I&apos;m sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.\n\nWhat we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula HernÃ¡di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet&apos;s brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.\n\nThe themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.\n\nYou can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That&apos;s really the brilliance of this movie, it&apos;s kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.\n\nWhat I&apos;ve said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film&apos;s purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the screening JancsÃ³ even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I&apos;ll bid you farewell, if you think you&apos;d enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.",

      "reviewBody": "Along Came Polly is not a masterpiece in the rom-com genre, but I did enjoy it, and although the humour is sometimes gross, it does make you laugh. However I would not consider this to be one of those movies to watch again and again. A one time watch, or just once every so often is good enough.\n\nReuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) analyses risk for a living and is an extremely cautious man, with an extremely cautious life. When he marries Lisa (Debra Messing), everyone considers them the perfect couple, as they are well suited to one another. But when Lisa cheats on him on their honeymoon with their Frenchie-French scuba diving instructor Claude (Hank Azaria...BUFFED UP!), Reuben&apos;s heart breaks. He returns to New York and bumps into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), and they begin dating, despite being very different. Polly lives in the moment, Reuben thinks ahead. Polly loves ethnic food, Reuben hates it. Polly isn&apos;t too big with long-term relationships, whereas Reuben swears by it. Nevertheless their relationships seems to work. But when Lisa comes crawling back to Reuben, he is forced to make a decision. Who will it be, the free-spirited Polly, or Lisa, with whom Reuben shares a lot in common?\n\nI thought this movie was very cute and I liked the ferret :). Ben Stiller&apos;s performance was not outstanding in this movie but he did play Reuben well, and to be honest I cannot imagine another actor as Reuben at all. He has a very identifiable voice and the knack of just being plain adorable. I would not say he owned the movie, like he usually does, but he certainly was very good. Jennifer Aniston was also just over average. I loved her in Friends, Bruce Almighty, but sadly I don&apos;t think she did as well as she could have. But her role was smaller than I would have thought. I really liked her character Polly Prince though, and I think this was because Polly was so much like myself. The last-minute planning, being untidy, liking ethnic food, the hunting for keys...all of this screamed &apos;ME&apos; all the way through, and I thought Polly was a very realistic and likable character. Hank Azaria was so cute as Claude! Okay, so he was meant to be the villain, but come on, he&apos;s BUFF. He has a six pack and the French accent was just amazing. He is really talented if he can do about 5 different voices in &apos;The Simpsons&apos; and then the Frenchiest French accent ever, here. Debra Messing made a small role as Lisa but she wasn&apos;t anything great, Philip Seymour Hoffman was hilarious as Sandy Lyle. I thought the character was gross, but very likable.\n\nNot the best from Stiller or Aniston, but still delivers laughs."

I remember that he was still like a little kid in a lot of ways---pushing his friend&apos;s motorcycle on Main Street in Catskill for him to pop start it, walking around with a NY paper&apos;s cartoon showing a drawing of him holding the world in his hands, and exclaiming to anyone who would listen &quot;This is so fly!&quot; And much more. He was happy, healthy, and on a course for greatness. Then Cus died, and after an incredible series of fights that left him with all the belts, Mike threw it all away. He doesn&apos;t shy away from telling the world how foolish he was, and it is heartbreaking to see him on the verge of tears as he seems to relive it in his memory. Director Toback does a brilliant job in letting his subject do all the talking, and it is riveting. One star off for not making it clearer why he let Don King take over and basically destroy his career. While he does acknowledge the piece of crap that King is, he needed to go a little further, since King was sort of the anti-Cus, if you will. I know Mike knew that he was always welcome to come back to Catskill, where Cus&apos;s knowledge is still being imparted even today.",

      "reviewBody": "Eddie Murphy once again slaps on the fat suit to play Sherman Klump. And Mama Klump, and Big Daddy Klump, and Grandma Klump, and Brother Klump, and Buddy Love (although without the fat suit on that one). Since the Klump dinner scene was easily the best scene in the original film, they decided to focus on the entire family in the sequel. And somehow got Janet Jackson to fall in love with Sherman. I wish I knew how that happened. Anyway, while the movie still focuses on Sherman and his quest for love and scientific goals (this time making people younger), the rest of the family gets involved in the story lines. And I thought that took away from the heart of the film. While it was fun to see all the Murphy characters, there needed to be a better story line for them, rather than a bad marriage. Although I will admit the horny Grandmother Klump story line was very funny. They should make a movie just about her next time. But I regress. The story line with Sherman and Buddy, about how Buddy was still inside Sherman, and Sherman managed to get him out, only to have Buddy come to life, and then Sherman is becoming more stupid by the minute and will go into a vegetable state unless he eats Buddy. It&apos;s all very cheesy. I mean come on, one tear from Janet near the end manages to bring Sherman back to life? It was all very corny.\n\n This is not to say that there aren&apos;t funny scenes in the movie. Again, I thought the best scene was the entire Klump family going out to dinner and all the hi-jinks that ensue. And there were other funny moments scattered throughout the film, but not enough for me to really get into the movie and enjoy it. Basically it was a moment to moment film, not an overall enjoyment film. Eddie Murphy is amazing, and Martin Lawrence has got nothing on dressing up as a fat woman, but it&apos;s just not enough. The Klumps is something you can rent for a quiet evening at home.",

Only difference here is that there&apos;s a little bit of gore which can upset a few people. And the dubbing is pretty awful, It sounds like the same guy who voices over 3 other characters in the film.\n\n I could go on about some other distractions, but I&apos;m not here to pan this flick.As a matter of fact, I LIKE IT! You have to realize that this film was a stepping-stone for the action genre that has continued to this day. So give credit where credit is due!\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of the film is the opener, Django himself, walking (What? No horse?) through a dark,cold,muddy world, dragging his good ol&apos; mysterious coffin and being accompanied by the music of the title song (A catchy tune which sounds like a combination of Elvis and the Moody Blues).\n\nWhat follows next is common in &quot;Spaghetti-land&quot;, so If you love these films or have never seen any, be obliged to take a peek at this flick."

Here you have a NYPD Detective Chuck Baker(Chuck Jeffreys) who also got a trick or two up his sleeves is trying to solve the crimes of fighting champions being murdered by a steel-fingered psycho(Darren Shahlavi). This guy reminds me of that steel finger joke in the movie &quot;Half a Loaf of Kung Fu&quot;. This guy is very brutal, and he&apos;s relentless. I would fight to the death against this creep. He kills the master, and he kills this tough man named Dutch(Rob Van Dam, RVD OF ECW, WCW Fame). Man, I thought he would take the guy out simply. Oh Well! Then there&apos;s the niece of the master, Kelly(Brandie Rocci) who can kick serious butt against the bad guys. Ken O&apos;Hara(Gary Daniels) is a swift and smooth fighter, whose demons at work hinders his recovery, when he fights to get his family back, he and Baker have a fighting chance against the killer. This movie is non-stop, and that stunts everyone pull, is a classic. Enjoy the fight, enjoy the movie, it was worth the watch. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I love found footage movies. I adored Paranormal Activity, and I&apos;m a huge apologist for The Blair Witch Project as well as, recently, V/H/S. This gimmick, and it is definitely a gimmick, has potential to make for classic horror when put in the right hands.\n\nThat didn&apos;t happened here. Michael Axelgaard is the definition of the wrong hands.\n\nHollow is the worst found footage movie I&apos;ve seen so far. It represents perfectly everything that&apos;s wrong with this gimmick, and how easily it can be abused.\n\nIdeally, the first person format should be used to assist in the storytelling. With Paranormal Activity, the movie is all about creating a realistic setting, and much of the plot revolves around observing your room as you sleep. I can&apos;t imagine that as a traditionally shot film. It taking place on the protagonist&apos;s camera is important.\n\nMovies like Hollow don&apos;t use this filmmaking style as a tool; they use it as an excuse.\n\nIt&apos;s an excuse to make your low budget, equivalent to that of a student film, seem less obvious; an excuse to never actually show anything substantial; an excuse to never fully develop your characters; an excuse to point the camera at someone&apos;s feet for minutes at a time and get away with it.\n\nOn top of that, nearly every single scare in Hollow is a fake out. The character will point the camera at something, or start to walk somewhere, and things will get quiet. Suddenly, the camera SUDDENLY CUTS to something else, or a bird will fly out.\n\nThese can be fun sometimes, but when the ratio of fake out scares to real scares is roughly 9 to 1, there&apos;s a serious issue. That number is probably too generous.\n\nNow let&apos;s talk about the actual scares. What I mean by this is times we or the characters are frightened by something that turns out to be a real threat - the difference between a cat jumping out at you, and a monster jumping out at you.\n\nI can recall maybe three in the entire film.\n\nAnd who is the villain, exactly? The closest we get is a tree, which never actually does anything sinister (that skull on the poster is a complete lie), and a jacket. A character&apos;s coat becomes one of the major threats of the final act.\n\nThe rest of the film is a combination of useless filler scenes, mostly revolving around relationship drama that not even these actors seem to care about, and scenes of characters running around screaming as the camera points at the ground, with the viewer not being able to see anything.\n\nThe ending is puzzling. Not because it&apos;s surprising, but because it&apos;s so spectacularly unsurprising that you can&apos;t help but scratch your head. The movie forecasts exactly what will happen from the opening scene, and then by the end, it happens. And that&apos;s it. It never even attempts to offer anything else.\n\nHollow is essentially 90 minutes of watching vacation footage your douche bag kind-of-but-not-really friends shot while snorting cocaine and screaming about haunted trees.\n\nBut other than that, it was pretty good.",

Before watching it I read several reviews and some of them critized it for being pointless and also for being a waste of two hours. But I decided to still watch it and that was great. Why? Probably because I am a father to a two year old son that I love more than anything. So I could relate to Sandra Bullocks character throughout. The decisions she took, the dedication she showed throughout was based on the love and protection for her child and loved ones. I don&apos;t want to write more than that. I thought the movie was great thoughout. Two hours felt like one hour. It was intense and interesting. Perhaps predictable as well but for this movie I didn&apos;t mind that. My curiosity was still on the highest level throughout.\n\nOne thought though is that perhaps some bad reviews comes from people watching this on a small screen. This movie is probably best viewed on a big screen with a good sound.\n\nI don&apos;t want to write reviews for good movies because I think a good movie should be seen without any previous knowledge. But since this in my opinion is underrated and many of the negative reviews will scare viewers I felt I needed to say something.",

      "name": "A perceptive coming of age film that avoids genre clichÃ©s",
      "reviewBody": "33-year old director Jae-eun Jeong&apos;s Take Care of my Cat is a perceptive coming of age film about five young Korean women trying to cope with the transition from high school to the adult world. Though a bit overlong and somewhat disjointed, it is an honest work that avoids genre clichÃ©s of sex, drugs, and even boyfriends. The film received a major award at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2002, but did not gain proper recognition until its DVD release this year. The title refers to a stray kitten, Tee tee, which is passed between the five girls and, as circumstances pull their lives apart, serves as a connection between them. Set in the City of Inchon, the bleak working-class environment establishes the mood of the film. According to the director, &quot;Inchon is a city with many immigrants who came during the war or in the 70s during industrialization. It is a city full of wanderers that matched my characters who were outsiders.&quot; \n\nThe girls are in constant movement. Whirling through the city on subways and buses between work, clubs, and restaurants, we get a sense of their optimism and energy. Programmed to play entire melodies, their cellphones ring constantly as the girls coordinate their meetings and activities. In a clever gimmick, the director floats the text messages on the screen, in bus windows, and building walls. While it took me a while to get to know each character, each one has a strong and distinctive personality and, by the end, I felt a part of their lives. Hae-joo (Yo-won Lee) is the most outgoing and self confident but can be self-absorbed and insensitive to others. Through connections made by her affluent family, she lands a job as an assistant in a brokerage firm. \n\nAlthough aware of the fact that she is a &quot;low-wage&quot; earner without much of a future at the company, she becomes fashion-conscious, carries a Louis Vuitton bag, and is acutely conscious of her appearance, spending money on laser surgery for her eyes. When she moves to Seoul to advance her career, it further strains the relationship with the others. Ji-young (Ji-young OK) is the opposite, a soft-spoken, sensitive young woman who lives in the poorest section of town with her grandparents in a run-down shack and cannot find a good job. She lacks the means to develop her considerable potential as a designer artist and is prone to moods of sadness and withdrawal. Tae-hee, in an outstanding performance by Doo-na Bae, is the glue that holds the friendships together by arranging meetings and bringing people together.\n\nTae-hee works for her father in his traditional &quot;hot-rock&quot; healing spa and, in her spare time, types for a poet afflicted with cerebral palsy who has developed strong feelings for her. Twins Bi-ryu (Eun-shil Lee) and Ohn-jo (Eun-joo Lee) play minor roles as they try to scrape together a living hawking jewelry on the street but their characters seem included more for comic relief than to further the plot. The girl&apos;s world seems strange to the older generations but the harsh reality of survival is constant, their ambitions often at odds with the male-dominated society. Ji-young wants to be a textile designer but is unable to go to school, Hae-joo wants a respectable job in the business world, and Tae-hee dreams of escaping from the suffocating restrictions of her family, though recognizing that running away is &quot;so tacky&quot;. \n\nShe comes into open conflict with her family in a restaurant when her traditional father, rather than admitting he can&apos;t read the menu, orders the most popular dish for everyone. Tension arises between Hae-joo and Ji-young when Hae-joo invites everyone to go on a shopping spree even though she knows that Ji-young may feel left out. Tae-hee is the most supportive and is there for Ji-young when tragedy strikes, willing to do whatever is necessary to support her. Take Care of my Cat has no peak dramatic moments, no plot contrivances that propel us toward certain emotional responses, only the sad undercurrent of the inevitability of change in a confusing world. Backed by the moody electronic sound track by Kim Jin-cheol and Byul, I found Take Care of my Cat to be a moving experience. Jae-eun Jeong does not provide easy answers as to the direction the girls will take, but, by avoiding cynicism, she allows us to see their life in terms of possibility.",

      "reviewBody": "This film bears no resemblance to its source material, the books, nor to the &quot;Gummi-Tarzan&quot; that fans cherish; it fails to even make an attempt. The books were replete with humor, entertainment, and a delightful superpower component, whereas this adaptation is decidedly disheartening. I struggle to comprehend the decision to produce this film under the &quot;Gummi-Tarzan&quot; moniker, as it shares no connection with the original series. As a child, I recall watching this and waiting with bated breath for the appearance of superpowers, only to be met with perpetual disappointment. The absence of these extraordinary abilities, a defining aspect of Gummi-Tarzan, feels like a blatant disregard for the series&apos; primary allure.\n\nThis film is akin to a Spider-Man adaptation in which, rather than possessing superpowers, the protagonist is simply a teenager with a penchant for climbing, earning him the nickname &quot;Spider-Man&quot; from his father. The disparity between the lighthearted, whimsical, and amusing nature of the books and the somber, melancholic, and bleak tone of the movie is striking.\n\nWhile the movie itself may be passable, it is difficult to reconcile the transformation of a beloved childhood book series, replete with superpowers, whimsy, and humor, into a slower-paced, grounded, introspective, and reflective film devoid of fantastical elements.\n\nRegrettably, the movie feels like a betrayal to the character of Gummi Tarzan, and could be perceived as false advertising.",

At least half of the film is taken up with clips of animals that are so poorly shot, it&apos;s often difficult to see what you&apos;re looking at. Animals that in nature are continents apart are presented as if they live in the same African jungle. I swear that some of the animals even appear to be in zoos or other unnatural settings. Piece these clips together, throw in a nonsensical story about the search for a lost city by some bored rich dudes, and add an even more nonsensical plot line where Buster Crabbe is searching for a cure to a deadly disease by slaving over a Bunsen burner in the jungle - you&apos;ve got Jungle Man. By the time our heroes come down with the illness, I had long ceased to care about any of it. I was rooting for their deaths as it might mean the movie would end faster. It&apos;s all a total bore. The one hour run-time feels more like an eternity. If you can&apos;t tell, I didn&apos;t care much for Jungle Man.\n\nThe lone highlight for me was seeing Buster Crabbe and Charles Middleton together on screen. I&apos;m not much a fan of the old Flash Gordon serial, but I realize it&apos;s historical significance. Seeing Flash and Ming together here was pretty cool.",

Au contraire it is actually a pretty good movie.\n\nUsually we are used to see pretty light, or feel-good movies like Elling, Fritt Vildt and Himmelfall, but here we are taken straight down into the darkness and a subject that we all have strong feelings about, pedophilia.\n\nThe protagonist, a young pool-guard, one day just put down his foot and says &quot;Enough&quot;, a bit like Michael Douglas in Falling Down, when he suspect a pedophile in the pool. The result is excellent. The actor really pulls it off, with just the right amount of anger and frailness, and his presence is world class. The interacting between his character and the prostitute that lives next door is top.\n\nI really hope that I will discover more of these Norwegian diamonds when I keep looking west. I confess, I do believe Norway has passed Sweden when it comes to making good and unexpected movies.\n\nI will keep a look out for more movies from Erik Richter Strand and will definitely keep my eyes open for Nils JÃ¶rgen Kallstad",

The story itself is really rather far-fetched but even this aspect is sort of sorted by some generous bending of unwritten rules and smart legal jargon.\n\nLegally Blonde will always work better for me, when Miss Woods is gaily arranging sorority parties and being just ridiculously OTT about fashion choices and tartly responding when others try and make her look ridiculous. This comic timing is perfectly suited to the bubbly and vibrant Witherspoon and she remains a tonic throughout.\n\nThe court case that she falls into defending might be essential to the story of how she gets her legal qualifications and to prove all her doubters totally wrong, but for me, this plays second fiddle to the comedy I mention. The romance angle, an essential premise, as at the start, her boyfriend Warner, who she was absolutely sure was going to propose to her, dumps her, essentially because she&apos;s a &apos;dumb&apos; blonde.\n\nHe&apos;s off to Harvard and so, naturally, Elle scrapes through the preliminaries with the skimpiest of appropriate qualifications (majoring in obscure fashion, for example) so that he could no longer hold that reason against her. He, though, is already dating the surly Selma Blair.\n\nI&apos;ve probably seen Legally... three times now. The sequel/s don&apos;t command any great affection for me but this original is one that is both a great comedy and has a real feel-good factor too, without resorting to the gross-out and toilet humour that&apos;s unfortunately seen as an essential ingredient in today&apos;s US comedies.",

(I&apos;m kidding about one of these.) Not to mention generations of Italian and Jewish Indians, and more white actors in blackface than there are seeds in a watermelon.\n\nJoan is teamed here with Steven Seagal, quite probably the last word in inarticulate and extremely violent tree-hugging Buddhists. Sort of the Billy Jack of the Barents Sea. His jacket has more fringe on it than you&apos;d see at a reunion concert by the Buffalo Springfield.\n\nTogether, they try to build a world where an interracial couple can be happy in an oomiak built for two.\n\nA number of years ago, I spent nearly 8 seconds at a book-signing in the presence of Michael Caine. For each of those seconds, he was extremely personable. So it&apos;s a bit of a revelation for me seeing him playing his two-faced vicious Hun of a smooth oil company CEO. Old favourite John C. McGinley also appears against type as one of Caine&apos;s nastier henchthugs.\n\nFinally, there&apos;s Seagal&apos;s direction which takes his film on this ecological walk through the woods which makes it all seem a little like Oliver Stone after too many days trapped in a sweatlodge.\n\nIt&apos;s so ridiculous I actually found myself enjoying the whole thing quite a bit."

      "name": "Most Authentic Tarzan of the B/W Era; Fine Cast; Nearly Very Good",
      "reviewBody": "This may not be a great film by anyone&apos;s standards. But apart from Tarzan speaking in short words, this film I suggest, after more than fifty years of reading and considering Tarzan properties, is the closest any filmmaker has come to capturing the essence of Tarzan as Edgar Rice Burroughs created him. Consider this unpretentious little film&apos;s many assets. It features a very attractive and ethical young Tarzan and Jane in the persons of Lex Barker and Vanessa Brown. The feel of the film is jungle, outdoors, hot, humid, on the fringes of a rather rough civilization at best, a zone on the edge of danger. There are very fine supporting performances by a cast that includes Arthur Shields, Robert Alda, Denise Darcel, Anthony Caruso, Robert Warwick and Hurd Hatfield, Mary Ellen Kaye, Peter Mamakos and others. The storyline involves Tarzan and the others with a somewhat alien civilization whose desperate servants, ethically-challenged leader and villains put the whole surrounding group of tribes as well as Tarzan and the others at risk by their illegal actions. The script is well-above average; the characters are quite well-developed and often multi-dimensional; and the climactic escape from living death in a temple engineered by Tarzan I found to be at once exciting, important and decently filmed. The plot line in &quot;Tarzan and the Slave Girl&quot; is at first sight unusually rich for an adventure story. The Lionians and their king have grown desperate. They are not producing children. Under the bad advice of Sengo, played by Caruso, they have begun capturing young women from surrounding peoples in order to solve their dilemma, instead of seeking help through other means. Tarzan becomes involved with the problem when he tries to single-handedly stop a raiding party from carrying off yet another victim. Finally, it becomes necessary to try to reach the Lionians&apos; capital city via an expedition through a country populated by people who disguise themselves as trees and fire blow-darts as weapons. The disease attacking the Lionians is discovered by a doctor, Arthur Shields; fending off amorous advances from his nurse, a sexy half-caste played by Darcel, Tarzan and his trusty, brave but drink-prone helper Alda,and Shields reach the city of the Lionians and find the imprisoned girls there--and also Jane and the nurse, who have also been captured during their roundabout journey to the city. They fail to move the king, Hatfield; and Caruso convinces him to seal Tarzan and Jane in their temple as dangerous enemies to his rule. Tarzan climbs to the top of the structure and overturns the idol sealing the aperture there, thus escaping the trap. Meanwhile, the High Priest of the civilization, Warwick, is being fed to the lions for daring to speak out against the King&apos;s unethical scheme. Trazan&apos;s prowess in battle with help from his friends wins the day, and Caruso falls into the lions&apos; den, Warwick being freed. Shields finds a cure for the malady and the King embraces amicable relations with all once more. The enslaved girls are returned to their homes; and Alda convinces Darcel to take care of him alone and forget about seducing Tarzan. Having said so many good things about the film, it is necessary to report that apart from some good action scenes, especially those involving boats emerging from or reentering a swamp with islands in it, a very Burroughsian touch, and the city&apos;s palace interiors, the production by Sol Lesser&apos;s production company in B/W suffers from lack of richness. The tribes involved in the danger mostly resemble Mexican villagers with strange wigs inflicted upon them; and director Lee Sholem, who does well with his very fine cast of actors, has no means of overcoming the budgetary handicaps under which he labors. Lesser was able to produce several much-richer-looking later Tarzan efforts, to his great credit; but this transitional film introduced a post-Johnny- Weismuller Tarzan in Lex Barker, solved some of the problems that needed solving in order to improve the MGM-family-oriented domestic barriers that kept Tarzan from seeking out important adventures; and incidentally the film provided an attractive and very-Burroughsian realization of the original adventure vision the author had dreamed up, as an anti-Communist argument for genetic human worth as against conditioned obedience, four decades earlier. Nearly a very-good film.",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t know anything about David Mamet before I saw this film... now I know that he&apos;s got a penchant for characters with ulterior motives and slang-heavy dialog. Going into this film, I didn&apos;t expect anything but a(surprise surprise) heist flick. I got just that. Not just a heist flick, but a well-acted, nicely directed and quite entertaining one, at that. The plot is pretty good, and keeps your interest throughout. There are a fair bit of double-crosses throughout, and near the end, it does get somewhat tiresome. The acting is all top-notch. Not one performance was even slightly off. It&apos;s no surprise to see such high-quality acting from Hackman, Lindo and Rockwell, but I had not expected such excellent performances from DeVito and Jay. The writing is very good, but Mamet uses too many clichÃ©s and there&apos;s just a tad too much going on in the shadows, people conspiring against each other. The dialog tries oh so hard to be clever, and occasionally succeeds, but more often than not, it just comes off as pretentiousness, with all the slang, the attempts at being clever and the ridiculously high pace it sometimes sports. The cinematography is great, not one shot was poor or out of place. The pacing is mostly good, though the film seems to go on just a bit too long. All in all, an entertaining heist film, but not one to watch much more than one time. I recommend this to all fans of heist flicks, any of the actors and David Mamet(who seems to be all about these films). 7/10",

The old guy character which was voiced by Rob schnieder was off the hook. I am not much of a animated fan, but tell you what; I watched the movie for that old guy who made the whole feature worth of watching and enjoyable.\n\nAt certain points of the movie, I felt i am gonna cry. When sandler opens the holiday card from his parents the first time after 20 years, that was quite a moment. I literally felt it. When the Old dwarf (sorry) couldn&apos;t get the prestigious patch award, i felt i am gonna cry. These are the moments that you cherish while watching a movie.\n\nAlthough there are some parts that are not good for kids because of adult humor. However, its worth watching. Highly recommend to adults. Please watch it if you haven&apos;t. You&apos;ll not regret the fun.\n\nMy rating: doesn&apos;t matter. A good movie doesn&apos;t require any ratings to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews, I tell you this: They&apos;re not complaining about the movie, they&apos;re complaining because they feel abused by a continous stream of movies from a beloved franchise. It seems ironic, I know, but having nothing for so long and suddenly watching different posters every six months, has to be confusing and bound to raise some eyebrows.  However, we have to look at it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars&apos; story! So all of this backlash for having so much of the thing you love is simply a tantrum that I hate to see on so many of my fellow Star Wars&apos; fans.\n\nThis a very well made film that anyone can enjoy. Plot, acting, FX, Photography, Cast, etc. They did a great job with everything. Taking into account the enourmous pressure of making a film from such a historical franchise, I take my hat off for anyone who has the bravery to do this.\n\nSo, go and watch it, not with skepticisim, but with that natural feeling of curiousity and love you have every time you sit at the movie theater. I promise, you&apos;ll be pleased.",

Brilliant editing keeps things flowing while still leaving space for reflective moments. The science of memory is also cleverly interweaved into the tragic experiences of Kandel&apos;s family in Vienna during the Nazi era. One of the best science documentaries ever.",

A decent supporting cast, headed by Ben Johnson playing himself. There&apos;s also Bruce Cabot, Richard Jaeckal, Christopher George and soon-to-be wife Lynda Day, Andrew Prine, Glenn Corbett, and Geoffrey Deuel as Billy the Kid. All in all, not a bad bunch. It&apos;s all enjoyable enough but not one of Duke&apos;s best.",

      "reviewBody": "This film got released during my PG days in 2002. But, I happened to see it only after 2 years. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it remains one of my all time favorites ! ! Vikram has given a good performance as a toughie named &apos;Gemini&apos; . He tangles up with another baddie &apos;Teja&apos; PLayed by the talented Kalabhavan mani. The story of how Gemini ousts teja on his way to transforming in to a good guy is told in the usual saran way.\n\nNow, my opinion about saran is that he is the most underrated director of Tamil film industry. He is a hugely talented director with a comic gift of penning taught screenplays which really make his films a treat to watch. If u notice keenly, all his films have a very small story which can easily be written on the back of a stamp. But, his screenplay makes the movie very interesting. Take movies like Kadhal Mannan, Amarkalam, Parthen rasithen and even Alli Arjuna. All these movies are hits and u can see that&apos;s only because of his superb screenplay which makes the viewer tied to the screen.\n\nHere too, he has handled the treatment exceptionally well. This movie stands out from the rest of his films, and I personally consider this as a masterpiece from Saran. I didn&apos;t find even one single scene boring and I &apos;ve seen this many times, since I first saw it.\n\nAnother thing to be mentioned with saran is that his bonding with Bharadwaj. They both have combined together to give many superb hits. In Gemini too, almost every song is a super hit. The background music has also been wonderfully composed (especially when Teja makes his entry and the college fight scene).\n\nKiran makes her Tamil debut with this movie. The comic pair of Dhamu and Vaiyapuri combine together in this film too and have provided a tickler ! ! Charlie too comes for some scenes and does justice for his role.\n\nKalabhavan Mani plays the villain and has done en excellent role. He has used his mimicry skills to perfection in this film and has provided wholesome support to Vikram.\n\nThis movie went on to become a blockbuster hit for Vikram and was re made in Telugu also, starring Venkatesh.\n\nOverall, A great piece of work from Saran. Saranukku oru OO Podu ! ! !",

The evil Salamander People do battle by floor exercise, apparently, as they backflip their way to victory.

      "reviewBody": "I have read countless reviews of this movie that have derided it for everything from glorifying drugs to being unchristian to being boring. Maybe my mind works very much like director Terry Gilliam&apos;s (I loved &apos;Brazil&apos; and &apos;12 Monkeys&apos;), but the last thing I would do to this movie is deride it.  It is a brilliant adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson&apos;s generation-defining book of the same name - it stays very faithful to the events in the book.\n\nFirst of all, this movie literally glows with Gilliam&apos;s eye for detail that he has consistently displayed throughout his career.  The sets are so elaborate, one could never take in all the scenery from any number of viewings without slowing it down and watching very closely.  The bombardment of the bright, flashing lights of Las Vegas and the bizarre camera angles, as well as surreal sets make for an interesting and entertaining presentation regardless of a lack of coherency and taste. What we have here is a movie riddled with black humor and a horrifying satire of the American dream.  I&apos;ll admit it takes a very `unchristian&apos; viewpoint to laugh at the `straight economics&apos; of allowing policemen to gang-f**k a girl for $30 a head.  Therefore, people bound by a constricting sense of morality should never have watched this movie in the first place.  It is for people like me who enjoy living a very un-stoic life (at least vicariously through movies) by having radical ideas and perspectives forced upon them.  Fear and Loathing is the embodiment of such a perspective - it is a gruesomely accurate depiction of the bi-product of the often-glorified 60&apos;s drug culture.   And one thing that countless critics seem to carelessly omit in their analyses is the constant references to the `American Dream.&apos;  Johnny Depp (Raoul Duke/Hunter Thompson), in his verbose verbal narrations, makes quite a few references to a desparate hunt for reason behind the madness of not only this `American Dream&apos;, but the drug culture as well - &quot;He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.&quot; - Dr. Johnson (displayed before the opening scene). The problem with the waning popularity of this movie is simply that its design was not meant to appeal to the buttoned-down mainstream.  People that want to laugh and cry in a movie theater and then get the hell on aren&apos;t the type of people that would enjoy seeing an unjustified drug-induced frenzy on Las Vegas.  This movie has everything a critic should be looking for in a masterpiece - magnificent cinematography, lovely acting, shock value, provocation of thought, and a meaning behind it all.  To freaks like me it also has immense entertainment value as well.  This work will be one of my favorite movies of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "Innocents with Dirty Hands appears to have something of a poor reputation among it&apos;s viewers and that made me go into it expecting something a bit sub-par from the great French director, so you can imagine my delight when I found that there&apos;s very little wrong with this twisted thriller and while it&apos;s not quite up there with the best of Claude Chabrol (films such as This Man Must Die, The Butcher and The Breach); it&apos;s a thriller that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat for the duration of the film and provides plenty of shocks and twists along the way! The film is unlike some of Chabrol&apos;s other films in that the plot is rather simple and the film focuses on a couple with the surname Wormser. Louis Wormser is 18 years senior to his wife Julie and can no longer have sex after suffering a heart attack. When Julie meets young stud Jeff Marle, the two plot to kill Louis and hatch a plan to dispatch him and deflect suspicion from themselves. However, things go awry immediately after the murder when Julie finds herself alone and under suspicion.\n\nThe main influence for this film would seem to be The Postman Always Rings Twice as the two plots share a lot in common. Innocents with Dirty Hands does get criticised for being a bit too long, and this is a bit of a problem. The story has plenty to it and is constantly interesting thanks to the numerous twists in the second half; but it could have benefited from being a bit more streamline as the way it pans out does remove some of the suspense. However, this is hardly enough to condemn the film. The first hour building up the initial twist is absolutely superb and Chabrol keeps the tension bubbling nicely. After the initial twist, the film changes somewhat and the focus is more on surprising the audience, but despite this change in pace; the film still flows well. The film is bolstered by two excellent performances from the leads; the beautiful Romy Schneider is superb as the young wife while Rod Steiger is thoroughly convincing in the opposite role. The film works on a number of levels; it&apos;s entertaining, thrilling and also funny in places and while it&apos;s filmed with Chabrol&apos;s familiar verve and focuses on the marital relationship - it&apos;s also a change of pace for him. Overall, this is well worth seeing and I&apos;m sure that anyone who enjoys Chabrol&apos;s films will find a lot to like in this one.",

While the cast tries hard to make something out of it (and certainly Gustav Knuth and Paul HÃ¶rbiger have excellent moments), the film keeps dragging itself from one scene to the next. There are moments of very nasty editing which do not make this film a pleasure for the eyes.\n\nThe script has also a major flaw: the viewer could have easily done without the voice-over that tells the story. What the joke is of not revealing the face of the story teller in the last scene, will forever remain a mystery to me.",

DA Kersn feels that Jack not only murdered his wife and her house-maid but also faked his own injury to throw off the police&apos;s suspicions about him being the killer. DA Kersny also has it in for Jack personally in that being the owner as well as editor of the influential San Francisco Times he&apos;s been writing unrelentingly negative editorials about him. \n\nBeing indited for his wife&apos;s murder Jack seeks out former DA Teddy Barnes, Glenn Close, who used to work with Thomas Kersny at the DA&apos;s office. Teddy quit some four years ago because of a case that she helped him with in which a defendant Henry Styles was convicted. Teddy later found out that Kersny withheld vital evidence that would have found Styles innocent. Later in the movie Teddy finds out that Styles hung himself in his cell from non other then Kersny himself! This got her even more upset then she already was about that case. \n\nThis sets up the movies storyline: A brutal double-murder is committed and a DA who has it in for the murder suspect jumps into the case for personal more then for professional reasons. The lawyer who defends the murder suspect has guilt feelings for working with the DA prosecuting the case against her client. Added to all that she&apos;s almost driven into a serious depression when she finds out that the person that she helped the DA convict, who she later found out was innocent, has just killed himself. With all the &quot;red herrings&quot; flying around in the movie does the murder weapon a hunting knife with a jagged edge belong to Jack? Most of all did the affairs, by both Jack and Page, one or both lead to Page&apos;s murder? \n\nIt&apos;s also a mystery if the dashing and handsome tennis gigolo Bobby Slade (Marshall Colt),who was having an affair with Page, killed her when she threatened to leave him and then frame her husband Jack for her murder? \n\nThe movie &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; holds itself together pretty well until the final fifteen minutes and then just falls apart like a house of cards. The totally contrived as well as unrealistic ending hits the viewer like a solid punch right in the stomach and knocks all the wind out of him or her. It&apos;s hard to believe that the killer would end up being so careless and stupid after bing so smart and cunning during the entire movie. This after he got away with the crime Scot-free and having nothing at all to fear from the law, why did he have to blow it all in the end?\n\n&quot;Jagged Edge&quot; is not a bad movie it&apos;s a very good murder/mystery/court thriller but with a terrible ending and it&apos;s a good ending that&apos;s the most important thing in a movie like it.",

      "reviewBody": "A few days ago i watched the german movie &quot;Hatschipuh&quot; for the 23rd time and even as a grown up i still find it very very funny. Then i decided to search for it here on imdb. Bingo! there it was and here is my comment: For the first time i saw this movies at the age of 6. Since then i watched it again and again. It is sooo funny. Forget Eddy Murphy and Chris Tucker. The little gnomes know how to make you laugh. And youÂ´ll laugh your head of throughout the whole movie. I promise.\n\nThe Soundtrack is also superb and features a brilliant song made by Nena. Nena had a huge hit in the 80Â´s with her smash-single &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; ( 99 red ballons ).\n\nThe movie is directed by Ulrich KÃ¶nig who created the famous Pumuckl series, which was an incredible success in Germany. So you see, this movie has it all. Great acting, lots of fun and even some well made special effects. Go and rent or buy it.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "An enjoyable adventure set in 19th century Iraq , there Kara Ben Nemsi (Viktor Staal) a writer , adventurer and doctor crosses the sunny desert when he meets two lost men , a British , archaeologist Sir David Lindsay (Theo Lingen) and a German professor (Fernando Sancho who bears the comic relief) . Later on , they are attacked by slave traffickers commanded by Murad Ibrahim (Rafael Luis Calvo) , as they are fighting an unseen Arab enemy who always struck in the dark . Kar Ben Memsi escapes but the archaeologist and the sympathetic professor are imprisoned by Abu el Mot (JosÃ© Guardiola) . Soon after , the adventurer doctor is asked for help from Ibrahim , but Kara Ben Memsi frees a beautiful maid (Mara Cruz) and both of them escape on a boat pursued by Murad&apos;s hoodlums . \n\nThis is adventure movie including thrills , shots , fights , duels and marvelous oriental outdoors , though shot in Spain . Dangerous adventures and interesting roles along with solid action and a good sense of humor pulled off by a sympathetic couple : Fernando Sancho and Theo Lingen . The most spectacular scenes are the fights on the desert and the river surrounded by Crocs and hippos . Although some fights are not convincing and the short budget is occasionally revealed , as it is filled with stock-shots from Elephants , Crocodriles and hippos . Support cast is plenty of familiar Spanish faces , usual in co-productions of the 60s and 70s , such as : Fernando Sancho , Rafael Luis Calvo , Alfonso Rojas , Antonio Casas , Emilio Alvarez , Barta Barri , Julio NuÃ±ez ,Rufino InglÃ©s , Xan Das Bolas , JosÃ© Luis Martin and an ominous leader of the bandits , JosÃ© Guardiola , who played with vicious intensity . Originally it was planned to shoot this picture at its historical location in Turkey , but for organizational reasons it was decided to make it in Spain instead . The film is set in Basora , Iraq , though is was actually shot in Alicante, Comunidad Valenciana, Aranjuez, and Madrid, Spain ; being well photographed by the prestigious cameraman Alfredo Fraile .\n\nIt is based on Karl May novel , about a known personage , Â¨Kara Ben MemsiÂ¨ , this role starred several films , most of them performed by Lex Barker , such as : &quot;Kingdom of the Silver Lion&quot; (1965) by F.J Gottlieb , &quot;Wild Kurdistan&quot; (1965) by F. J Gottlieb , &quot;The Yellow One&quot; (1964) by Robert Siodmak and Der LÃ¶we Von Babylon (1959) titled Spain Â¨En Las Ruinas de BabiloniaÂ¨ or Â¨Lion of BabyloneÂ¨ also directed by RamÃ³n Torrado . And other silent versions starred by Carl De Vogt as &quot;Caravan of Death&quot; (1920) , Â¨Auf den TrÃ¼mmern Des ParadiesesÂ¨ (1920) and Â¨Die TeufelsanbeterÂ¨ (1920) . In addition , a series television titled &quot;Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi&quot; (1973), 26 episodes starred by Michael Vogler as Kara Ben Nemsi .\n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by Ramon Torrado , he made a mostly decent , colorful fun , but not without gaps , failures and flaws . it was not huge hit , but successful enough to have a sequel : &quot;Der LÃ¶we von Babylon&quot; following in the same year 1959 . Ramon was born in 1905 , Galicia, Spain. He was a director and writer, known for directing some vehicles of known Folklorics stars such as Peret in Amor a Todo gas (1969) , Manolo Escobar in Un Beso en Puerto (1966) and Paquito Rico in Malvaloca (1954). Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1965 Los Cuatreros , 1964 La Carga de la PolicÃ­a Montada , 1964 Relevo a Pistolero and 1963 Bienvenido, Padre Murray . Rating . 5.5/10 . Acceptable and passable .",

The movie insinuates a lot, but never actually proves or asserts anything, remains inconclusive. The &apos;flash forwards&apos; are irritating and if nothing else, confusing for the spectator not intimately &apos;in the know&apos; of the actual true story. The only positive aspect of the movie is the usually brilliant Rade Serbedzija who makes an excellent portrait of Miran Hrovatin. Not the same can be said of Giovanna Mezzogiorno in the role of Iliaria Alpi who is lackluster and unbelievable. When comparing these two characters in this film, you can clearly see what a difference great acting makes compared to average actring. All in all, below average, could and should have been much better.",

He has no style of his own, but that doesn&apos;t mean he is flat, or uninteresting, far from that. He is like a chameleon, he can give us comedies, horror movies, dramas, thrillers, crime films. And if you watch for instance SHIELD OF STRAW and this one or RAINY DOG, you will never notice anything in common between those three crime flicks. So, I don&apos;t even speak if you compare with comedies or ordinary dramas...\n\nI will try to get every Miike Takashi film available, even those not in France. \n\nThis one I comment now is very interesting, the other viewers have done it far better than I should do. The thing I find very offbeat is the music score. It is a sort of French music as we found in eighties French crime features, especially for TV audiences. For instance if you see, one day, some films made for the Series NOIRE TV show, you&apos;ll notice this kind of music. Very very strange. Accordion music for a Japanese crime film. Only Miike Takashi can give us this. Maybe a sort of tribute to France from which he was excited by Jean-Pierre Melville, one of his masters. This is finally that the Miike Takashi&apos;s style. He has NO style."

      "reviewBody": "Mae West was a veteran of burlesque, vaudeville and the Broadway stage by the time she made her first film in 1932 at the age of 39.  `She Done Him Wrong&apos; was her second film and her first starring role in an adaptation of her smash Broadway hit `Diamond Lil&apos;.  It was a play that West had written herself and it played to packed houses on Broadway for years.  This film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture and made Cary Grant into an instant star.  Mae went on to write nine of the fourteen screenplays for films in which she was to star.  Thus, all those great quotes we&apos;ve heard that are attributed to her were not only said by her, but written by her as well.  By 1935, she was the most highly paid woman in America.  To this day, she remains one of the female stars most often imitated by female impersonators.\n\nThis film is among her best.  It is full of the bawdy double entendre that became her trademark.  She was the queen of sexual innuendo and suggestive dialogue and many of her lines have become part of Americana (e.g. `Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?&apos;  And, `A hard man is good to find.&apos;  And of course, `Come up and see me sometime.&apos;)\n\nThe plot of this film is simplistic and it is clearly a vehicle for her enormous talent, leading up to the now famous proposal by Cary Grant at the end of the film.  Mae commands every frame of the film with her incomparable combination of sex appeal and ribald humor.  Her sense of comic timing is impeccable making the funny lines she writes that much more hilarious by the snide way in which she delivers them.\n\nBefore this film, Cary Grant had appeared in half a dozen films and was building a reputation as a solid actor.  However, none of his early films gave him the exposure that this film did due to its wild popularity at the time.  West handpicked him for the part saying that he combined virility with the bearing of a gentleman.  She wanted someone who would epitomize the now famous line, `Hello, warm, dark and handsome.&apos;  Though his role in this film is minor compared to West&apos;s, it made him a household name and a bankable star.\n\nThis classic film is a piece of film history that shouldn&apos;t be missed.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is among Mae West&apos;s best moments.  I highly recommend it.",

He decides to go to a bar in Hollywood with his also virgin friends Russ (Skip Lackey) and Jamie (Thomas Ballatore) to flirt and score. Meanwhile, the 400 year-old vampire Countess (Lauren Hutton) and her driver and butler Sebastian (Cleavon Little) are seeking out a virgin lad to keep her beauty and youth appearance. The Countess needs to feed three times on a virgin before the Halloween that is close otherwise she will look older. When the Countess stumbles with Mark in the bar, she brings Mark home and seduces him. Mark changes his behavior and soon he realizes that he is turning into a vampire. Is there any chance to save Mark? \n\n&quot;Once Bitten&quot; is one of my favorite movies ever and I do not know how many times I have watched it. The plot is very funny and Lauren Hutton is impressively beautiful and sexy. This movie for me is another gem from the 80&apos;s, maybe one of the best decades of the American Cinema history. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Procura-se Rapaz Virgem&quot; (&quot;Seeking a Virgin Lad&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I had the fortunate circumstance to see this double-billed as a very young child with Bava&apos;a Baron Blood. Some of the scenes remained in my mind - particularly the creepy figure of Shelley Winters. I recently set out to see the film again some 30 years later. I remembered more than I thought I had, and the film came back to me in large part. This is not a bad film nor a good film. As another reviewer noted, it is a pleasant, harmless time-waster - for those of us who enjoy &quot;wasting&quot; time on such things. Mark Lester and Chloe Franks play two orphans at an orphanage. Franks has an uncanny resemblance to the dead daughter of the orphanage&apos;s greatest patroness and benefactress, Shelley Winters. Winters is so good to the kiddies that every year she invites them to her sumptuous home at Christmas for yuletide fun. She has virtually no interest in Lester but soon has the keenest of hearts for the young Franks as her dead daughter&apos;s look-a-like. Well, Lester is a growing teen rebelling, Winters decays into some form of madness, a cast of stalwart British character actors such as Sir Ralph Richardson, Hugh Griffith, and Lionel Jeffries ably aid the story, and that story degenerates/diffuses into some sinister tale not unlike Hansel and Gretel. Well, the movie has a poor story overall - but Winter&apos;s fine performance albeit over-the-top to be sure does add emotional depth to it. Director Curtis Harrington is very able behind the camera if not dazzling.",

      "name": "Stunning in simplicity--yet a film that offers food for thought",
      "reviewBody": "This is a major work of cinema. It might not be well known but this film ranks with Fellini&apos;s &quot;La Strada&quot;, De Sica&apos;s &quot;The Bicycle Thief,&quot; or Mrinal Sen&apos;s &quot;Oka Oori Katha&quot; based on Premchand&apos;s story--&quot;Coffin.&quot; Why is it a major work? A UCLA graduate makes a film far removed from Hollywood approaches to cinema in Iran during the Shah&apos;s regime. The film was made 10 years before Shah quit Iran and was promptly banned. It was smuggled out of Iran to be shown at the Venice Film Festival to win an award, even without subtitles.\n\nThe film does not require subtitles. It&apos;s visual. It&apos;s simple. The story is set in a remote Iranian village, where owning a cow for subsistence is a sign of prosperity. The barren landscape (true of a large part of Iran) reminds you of Grigory Kozintsev&apos;s film landscapes as in &quot;Korol Lir&quot; (the Russian King Lear) where the landscape becomes a character of the story.\n\nThe sudden unnatural death of the cow unsettles the village. Hassan, the owner of the cow, who nursed it as his own child, is away and would be shocked on his return. Eslam, the smartest among the villagers, devise a plan to bury the cow and not tell the poor man the truth. Hassan returns home and is soon so shocked that he loses his senses. He first imagines that the cow is still there and ultimately his sickness deteriorates as he imagines himself to be the cow, eats hay, and says &quot;Hassan&quot; his master will protect him from marauding Bolouris (bandits from another village). Eslam realizes that Hassan needs medical attention and decides to take him to the nearest hospital. He is dragged out like a cow. &quot;Hassan&quot; is beaten as an animal as he is not cooperative to the shock of some humanistic villagers. The demented Hassan, with the force of an animal breaks free, to seek his only freedom from reality--death.\n\nThe film stuns you. Forget Iran, forget the cow. Replace the scenario with any person close to his earthly possessions and what happens when that person is suddenly deprived of them and you will get inside the characters as Fellini, De Sica or Sen demonstrated in their cinema.\n\nEvery frame of the film is carefully chosen. The realism afforded by the story will grip any sensitive viewer. There is a visually arresting use of a small window in the wall of the cowshed through which the villagers watch the goings on within the cowshed. The directors use of the window serves two purposes--it gives the villagers a perspective of the cowshed and the viewer a perspective of the cowshed watchers.\n\nThe film is also a great essay on the effects of hiding truth from society and the cascading fallouts of such actions.\n\nBut there is more. Director Mehrjui affords layers of meaning to his &quot;simplistic&quot; cinema. There is veiled criticism of blind aspects religious rituals (Shia Islam), a critical look of stupid villagers dealing with their village idiots, the jealous neighbors, the indifferent neighbors, the village thief--all elements of life around us, not limited to a village in Iran. The political layering is not merely limited to the poverty but the politics of hiding truth and the long term effect it has on society. Ironically, there are values among the poorest of the poor--the hide of a &quot;poisoned?&quot; animal cannot be sold!\n\nI was lucky to catch up with the rare screening of this film at the on-going International Film Festival of Kerala, India, that devoted a retrospective section of early Iranian cinema.\n\nThis is a film that should make Iran proud. It is truly a gift to world cinema.",

No, it may not have been as funny as their better-known films of the 1930s, but I didn&apos;t think it much below them, either. \n\nIt&apos;s not as totally outrageous as the boys&apos; earlier stuff but it also has fewer stupid stuff, too. Make no mistake: it has its share of genuinely funny material, both in dialog and in sight gags. The finale is a wild chase scene on a train that is very, very entertaining. That holds true for a wild stagecoach ride earlier in the picture. Once again, Chico comes up with the funniest lines.\n\nI think this is a solid comedy and an underrated Marx Brothers film . If you like &quot;the boys&quot; in their more well-known films, don&apos;t pass this one by.",

I thought the idea of monsters battling WWE style would be pretty damn entertaining and although there are plenty reviewers out there warning people not to watch this, i still gave it a try. Normally i give movies a full chance if i feel they have potential but i got out of this one early and i don&apos;t regret it. The monster make it up is pretty terrible for a movie that looks like it had a decent enough budget to do something better. I&apos;m talking mainly about the cyclops characters whose one and only eye never moves and you can see the slits where the actor looks through the mask. If this was done intentionally for laughs then im sure it would have been more obvious but it seems they tried to go for subtly and failed. When you go into a movie for the monster effects and they fail with the first monster then its probably not worth continuing. PS. there is no storyline to this movie so i think the only people who will get a kick out of it are big time wrestling fans.",

      "reviewBody": "We know that Mark Wahlberg refused to play Rockstar&apos;s &quot;Max Payne&quot; game before performing in this film, but, in addition, I must assume that neither the director nor the screenwriter ever played this game before, either. If there weren&apos;t so many shots of the background scenery that tied in with the game (although they were never fully or, in some cases, partially explored), I would assume that no one involved in the movie had even seen cut scenes from the game. I would have assumed that they got a one paragraph synopsis on the game, with character names, and just made up their own story that barely connected to the game storyline.\n\nWhen this movie was made for a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating instead of an &quot;R&quot; rating, most of the fans were nervous. And, after seeing the train wreck this film became, it&apos;s clear to see that our worst fears were realized. Worse even than whether this works as a movie adaptation of a video game is whether this film would works as a movie if you have no knowledge of the video game. Unfortunately, if you went to see this film looking for an action flick, you would say that this was one of the most boring, yawn-inducing films you&apos;d seen in the action genre.\n\nThe lack of narration throughout this film, the lack of a solid action director like John Woo (who knows how to do slow-mo), and the lack of anyone from the Rockstar team helping with screen writing added up to what can only be described as a hollow, dull film that has virtually no tie to the amazing game that spawned it. The studio system strikes again.",

      "name": "&quot;If gangsters looked like gangstersÂ&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "In the mid-to-late 1930s Alfred Hitchcock held a unique position for a director. Since the successes of The Man Who Knew Too Much and The 39 Steps, his destiny as a suspense filmmaker had been revealed not only to himself but also to his bosses at Gaumont. He was now only assigned material suitable to his area of expertise, and given a considerable amount of freedom to play around with the form. At the tail end of his British period, at a time when standard cinematic technique and narrative convention were well established, Hitchcock was effectively a researcher, of the kind that hadn&apos;t really been seen since the days of Griffith.\n\nSabotage is adapted from the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent, and it&apos;s worth taking a peek at a synopsis of the book to see the differences in the movie version, two of which are very significant. Firstly the novel is a kind of anti-heroic piece told largely from the point-of-view of the villainous Verloc. You couldn&apos;t have that in cinema in the 30s, so Verloc&apos;s opponents are beefed up into morally sound protagonists. However, it is still revealed from the outset that Verloc is the culprit, and we the audience are always kept aware of his doings even when the heroes are not. Dispensing with the Agatha Christie form of &quot;whodunit&quot; is essential to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense building. Revealing the identity and intentions of a killer keeps the audience constantly wondering when and how he will strike again.\n\nThe other important difference between the novel and film, is that Conrad states quite explicitly that Verloc and co. are anarchists, delving quite deeply into their ideology, as well as implying that they are Russians. Hitchcock&apos;s picture however makes no mention of the politics or nationality of the villains. They are simply generic foreign terrorists, existing to make the plot work. Imagine how much weaker this picture would be if we were asked to think about Verloc&apos;s motives. He has thick eyebrows, a sinister accent and he puts bombs on buses. What more do you need? \n\nOn a purely formalist level, Hitchcock&apos;s method is becoming increasingly streamlined. This is perhaps the earliest of his pictures which really feels like it was planned shot by shot before a single camera rolled. Of particular note is Hitch&apos;s staging of drama through reaction shots rather than expository dialogue. For example, Oskar Homolka&apos;s reaction to Stevie talking about gangsters, or pair of close-ups after John Loder is pulled through the air vent that tells us one of the gang members has recognised him. There are a few pointless technical touches, such as Homolka&apos;s vision of London in the fish tank glass, or Stevie&apos;s face popping up among the crowd of boys, but these are not as distracting as they could be in Hitch&apos;s earliest pictures.\n\nHitchcock rarely gave his actors any coaching, and relied upon a good professional cast to deliver the goods. In Sylvia Sydney and Oskar Homolka he has two of the best leads he had worked with so far, and their restrained naturalistic performances make their climactic scene together incredibly effective. The supporting cast are not bad either, although as usual with Hitchcock the comedy characters are the real standouts. Little-known stage veteran William Dewhurst, who plays the &quot;professor&quot;, is a joy to watch, and it almost looks as if his scenes are about to turn into Monty Python sketches.\n\nMuch as I detest the phrase &quot;experimental film&quot;, this was truly an experimental era for Hitchcock, or at least one in which his pictures were going through a process of natural selection. He realised afterwards he had made a huge mistake in one aspect of the main suspense sequence on the bus â I won&apos;t reveal it here as it&apos;s a major spoiler â and would ensure he never repeated the error. In spite of what was for him an embarrassing flaw, Sabotage is a very enjoyable and effective thriller, not among the greatest of his British period, but certainly worth watching.",

Just today, I heard the 4th movement of Camille Saen Sans 3rd Symphony, the &quot;organ symphony&quot;, and immediately I was reminded of the movie.\n\nYes, the movie was very good. Good story, good actors, great use of animals to portray the main characters. But if you look at the IMDb listing for the movie, way, way, down at the very bottom, there&apos;s a link to the &quot;soundtrack&quot;. I suggest you check it out to see what else makes this movie so good. They didn&apos;t have to hire John Williams to compose great new music.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Walking Tall&quot; is certainly one of the most ass kicking movies ever made. It&apos;s a fictionalization of the true story of Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, played here with conviction and intensity by Joe Don Baker. Buford has retired from life as a wrestler, hoping to settle down to a quiet life in his hometown, but he finds out that everything has gotten crooked, with local bigwigs running the show. Soon enraged at a system that does little to nothing to help the common man, he wages a personal war on corruption, using any method necessary. The movie does its job as far as manipulating its audience. It doesn&apos;t take long for viewers to get their blood lust up, and loudly cheer on our swaggering hero as he gives the assorted sleazy cretins their just desserts. And it doesn&apos;t hold back in the violence department, either; even if the blood is typically bright red movie blood that looks more like paint than anything, there&apos;s a lot of it that flows before the movie is over. And we can also definitely take interest in a story of a regular Joe who fumes at the injustices of the world, and refuses to live in a place where the big shots can have their way at any time. When Pusser puts a pompous, ineffective judge (Douglas Fowley) in his place, or humiliates a rat by having them crawl on all fours, it&apos;s not hard to pump one&apos;s fist in the air and yell, &quot;YEAH!&quot; All of the bad people are one dimensional, sleazy, selfish jerks; even though they may disagree with one another on methods used, they all look out for number one and enjoy their hold on the community. Provided one can take the brutality, and doesn&apos;t mind having their buttons pushed so obviously, &quot;Walking Tall&quot; is gripping. A superb cast really helps in the selling of the material, with Elizabeth Hartman as the troubled but loyal wife, Gene Evans as the ineffectual sheriff, Bruce Glover and Felton Perry as deputies, real-life siblings Leif Garrett and Dawn Lyn as the Pusser children, Noah Beery Jr. and Lurene Tuttle as Buford&apos;s folks, Rosemary Murphy as trouble making Callie Hacker, and assorted other character players such as Arch Johnson, Don Keefer, Sam Laws, Kenneth Tobey, Pepper Martin, Red West, Logan Ramsey, Richard X. Slattery, Sidney Clute, and John Myhers. Now, granted, all of what happens is plenty predictable, but it&apos;s hard to deny how this could become a crowd pleasing entertainment on a non-think level. And Buford&apos;s story didn&apos;t end here, with two sequels, a TV movie, a short lived series, and a loose remake &amp; subsequent sequels to follow, just going to show how enduring the concept of a strong, principled man fighting for what&apos;s right can be.

From a distorted Fidel giving a speech to a demonstration in Japan against a company that&apos;s poisoning the water. A true compilation of historical documents. It&apos;s three hours long, but it&apos;s worth it."

After nearly two decades of staring at his victim&apos;s face on a newspaper clipping in his cell, the paroled man attempts to find redemption, in the form of a mysterious minister (Freeman) and two needy women (Dunst and Hunter).\n\nI saw this film in the 99 cents store. I looked at the cast, which are great. I looked at the price, which was also great. And I read the plot in the back of the VHS, which got me to buy this film. It looked interesting. So there I watched the movie and I loved it! It&apos;s one of the best films ever made.\n\nIt was well crafted, beautifully cast, with a great script. I was moved and gripped. For me, this is Billy Bob Thornton&apos;s best performance, yet, although I haven&apos;t watched Monster&apos;s Ball, yet. His performance was superb, like everyone else in the cast, including Morgan Freeman, Holly Hunter, and Kirsten Dunst.\n\nThis film is subtle on everything. It keeps your attention and it is a good moral film. I never have much to say about great films, and it&apos;s no different here. If you see this film on the shelf, I suggest you to go buy it because it is your money&apos;s worth, although I bought it for 99 cents.",

The casting director and cinematographer should each get an award. This gem of a movie takes us on a journey, and the people we meet along the way are well worth the ticket price. \n\nA trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling. A day after seeing it, I find that specific shots of their faces still glow in mind like pieces of a mosaic. And the music is a genuine addition, as it should be in a film of this kind.

      "reviewBody": "I was drawn to The Killer Elite by a still of James Caan brandishing a walking stick at a ninja; a crippled Caan versus ninjas could surely only mean fun, especially with Sam Peckinpah behind the camera. Sadly, the scene isn&apos;t anywhere near as bad-ass as it sounds on paper, and to get there we have endure an awful lot of sluggish exposition that will most likely disappoint the majority of the director&apos;s fans.\n\nThe film opens explosively enough, with Mike Locken (Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) completing a job for ComTeg, a private agency contracted by the C.I.A. to handle work of a more &apos;sensitive&apos; nature. Locken and Hansen, friends as well as colleagues, are then tasked with protecting a defector, but things take an unexpected turn when Hansen, who has been bought out by a rival group, executes their ward and then turns his gun on Locken, shooting him in the arm and leg.\n\nCritically wounded, Locken is rushed to hospital and undergoes emergency surgery followed by months of intensive physiotherapy. Against all odds, Locken recuperates to the point where he is once again able to work, driven by the idea of taking revenge on his old buddy Hansen.\n\nWith Locken&apos;s gradual rehabilitation taking up the bulk of the movie, The Killer Elite is remarkably devoid of the brutal violence and slow-motion bloodshed that one associates with Peckinpah, with even a machine gun shootout in a crowded street resulting in only one dead body. Worse still, the ninja showdown that had first attracted my attention comes right at the end of the film and consists of uninspired and poorly choreographed fight action featuring some of the most inept ninjas imaginable.\n\nApparently, the film was made by Peckinpah while he was experiencing the new-found pleasures of cocaine, which goes a long way to explain why it is such a mess.",

Out of seven shot, three survived. And that it&apos;s intentional purpose was to encourage someone or somebody to expose the perpetrators that did it, with many conspiracy theories about who and what assaillants was involved, including the owner of the bowling alley himself. What this documentary does is showcases the grief and pain that has struck upon this family and many other families, since that&apos;s all the filmmakers can do. No forensic tests or DNA but a heck of a lot of boring theories. We, the viewers are pining for any type of arrest but no it does neither.",

The camera and the narration just show us what it the reporter sees - the way these people live. Highly recommended in these times when we are so obsessed with a life in communion with nature.",

Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn&apos;t act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth. It checks all the boxes except being interesting and having a good plot... you know... like missing the whole point of movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Plenty of action! Not a movie anyone will ever sleep through! The highs and lows of pirate life well depicted, even a &quot;walking the plank&quot; episode.\n\nWhen Lafitte the notorious pirate (Fredric March) comes a-courtin&apos; to the home of his lady-love, Annette (Margot Grahame), a matron cries out in alarm to hide the silver as he might steal it. Here was an instant recall of similar words uttered in the film &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; an earlier role March played so well, where as Jean Valjean he was looked on with suspicion by the housekeeper after seeking shelter in a priest&apos;s home. But as the pirate Lafitte he has plenty of stolen goods to pass on.\n\nGretchen (Franciska Gaal) as a young Dutchwoman has a little terrier in tow at the beginning, and both are spunky! She soon encounters and falls in love with Lafitte and lets him know about it but sadly, his heart is elsewhere.\n\nI really enjoyed seeing Akim Tamiroff portray Dominique with such flair. As a supporting actor his fine style has always been colorful and convincing in serious or lighter roles. He&apos;s fun to watch in this one.\n\nAndrew Jackson (Hugh Sothern) gives us a glimpse of what war and fighting was really like in those early frontier days when militiamen were more often local recruits ill-prepared and ill-equipped.\n\nOne can only wonder what would have been the course of American history if Lafitte had lived elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "The dream couple is back - a Viennese family chronicle with Maria Schell and O. W. Fischer\n\nThe 1961 film melodrama by Geza von Radvanyi (also director of &quot;MÃ¤dchen in Uniform&quot; (1958) with Romy Schneider and Lilli Palmer and &quot;Onkel Toms HÃ¼tte&quot; (1965)) is based on the play &quot;The Four Poster&quot; by Jan de Hartog. The film tells a family and time chronicle from Vienna from the end of Kakania (i.e. The end of the imperial and royal monarchy of Austria-Hungary after the First World War) to the annexation of Austria under Hitler to the early post-war period.\n\nAs a former dream couple, Maria Schell and O. W. Fischer (as always grossly overestimated and grossly overestimating themselves) play the factory owner couple Elisabeth and Rudolf von Hill, whose marriage, with all its ups and downs, is the focus for several decades. Infidelities, the loss of family members and the cruel blood cancer are played out against the background of historical times. O. W. Fischer can exude his penetrating, oily charm and Maria Schell (&quot;No one cries as beautifully and quickly as Maria Schell in the film&quot; (popular saying)) can suffer so wonderfully that it is a joy (albeit no longer appropriate for the time). . The idea for this casting coup, through which the former dream couple Schell/Fischer could finally be seen together again in a German film, came from the great film producer Artur Brauner, who also shot the film in his CCC studios in Berlin and on location shoots in Vienna. The script was written by the Hungarian author Ladislas Fodor, who also worked with Artur Brauner on the Doctor Mabuse films, &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; and &quot;Kampf um Rom&quot;.\n\nBasically, this film seems like a swansong for the German film industry, which was declining during these years. An old successful model that has been out of fashion for a long time is being successfully reactivated again and in the process mercilessly reveals all the deficiencies that were already there. It would have been so easy to give Maria Schell, who deservedly became a global star in recent years through films in France, Italy and America, more freedom instead of forcing her back into traditional role models.\n\nTen years earlier, Lilli Palmer had proven how this could be done better when she played the same material with her then husband Rex Harrison in the film &quot;The Four Poster Bed / Das Himmelbett&quot; and rightly received the Coppa Volpi at the Venice Film Festival for it.\n\nNevertheless, this film definitely remains exciting for those who are interested in German film history, if only because Maria Schell is always worth seeing. For everyone else, this Viennese chronicle might smell like mothballs.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; is actually slightly more bearable than the truly horrible 1994 movie, but that really isn&apos;t saying much. Where the previous one suffered from chronically bad casting for the Flintstones and the Rubbles (except for Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma), this benefits from Stephen Baldwin and Jane &quot;Best reason to watch &apos;Ally McBeal&apos; not called Lucy Liu&quot; Krakowski making a far less annoying Barney and Betty than Rick Moranis and Rosie O&apos;Donnell (the latter the only major cast member to return here, in voice mode only). The movie also has a few nice little touches like pictures of the cartoon Fred and Barney handed out to people, and the specially modified Universal logo with the Earth only showing one continent behind the word &quot;Univershell&quot; (&quot;Did anyone else see those giant letters out there?&quot;).\n\nAlan Cumming as the Great Gazoo (and a Mick Jagger-type rock star) is also one of the movie&apos;s pros... and indicative of its cons. Writers Deborah Kaplan &amp; Harry Elfont (&quot;Can&apos;t Hardly Wait,&quot; &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;) and the late Jim Cash &amp; Jack Epps, Jr (&quot;Top Gun,&quot; &quot;Anaconda&quot;) go for too many cheap gags, have a wilful disregard for the show&apos;s mythology - Gazoo didn&apos;t arrive until Fred and Barney were both married with children, for starters (and as another poster rightly says, he crashlanded as opposed to being sent) - and don&apos;t really have much of a plot going for them. The movie&apos;s all as silly as that episode where the boys befriended &quot;Ann-Margrock&quot; without knowing who she was. \n\nSpeaking of which, Ann-Margret (who guested on the TV show) returns to Bedrock to sing &quot;Viva Rock Vegas&quot; in a montage and over the credits, but her take isn&apos;t a patch on the BC-52&apos;s version of the theme song in the first one, and indeed the overall feeling of going down a level is everywhere - not just in the plot of Wilma&apos;s mum wanting her daughter (a miscast Kristen Johnston) to marry an uppercrust type (Thomas Gibson from &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;), but from the cast to the visual effects (Rhythm &amp; Hues aren&apos;t quite up to Industrial Light &amp; Magic&apos;s level) to the music (song-wise, that is; David Newman at least tries), the movie fits in all too well alongside the other losers directed by Brian Levant, he of &quot;Problem Child&quot; and &quot;Jingle All The Way&quot; infamy. And I still think James Belushi, not John Goodman or Mark Addy, IS Fred Flintstone.\n\nAt least the first one had Halle Berry and some puns in the credits (though this does have Jane Krakowski - hubba hubba). And no Joan Collins...",

      "reviewBody": "Chris Marker&apos;s elliptical, oblique documentary on the making of Akira Kurosawa&apos;s &quot;Ran&quot; is an uneasy blend of hagiography (usual Cahiers du Cinema stuff) and Marker&apos;s trademark meditations on the mediating role of technology in memory and the human experience, plus probably aging, and etc., etc., etc.  These Gallicisms seem out-of-place; but the philosophies are easily discarded.  What makes the film a pleasure are the glimpses we see of Kurosawa&apos;s work processes, in addition to all the detail and work that goes into the making of a true epic."

      "reviewBody": "The featured review rated this 3 and boring. I totally disagree. The film subtly tells the story of what war does to people in various ways.\n\n4 people (2 military, 2 civilian) are aboard this sentinel tower located between the only two countries left in the world after flooding has covered all other places. Ok, somewhat unbelievable.\n\nThis tower has a device that can change the fate for the entire planet and is meant as a fail safe device if the second country attacks this first country, who constructed this sentinel tower.\n\nThe problem is that they signed up for 2 years, and their relief is well overdue. They experience all sorts of communication issues. Then something appears, and changes the dynamics of the story. If you don&apos;t like growing tension, then I guess you&apos;d call that boring, but I took it more as a who-done-it mystery.\n\nImagine being out in the middle of the ocean between two warring countries, and you are the last line of defense on a rotting decrepid metal structure. That enough creates the tension.\n\nThe captain is a tough military lifer, and he plays that role well. His corporel seems less strict but still follows his orders. The two civilians just want to get paid and go back to dry land.\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of story here, enveloped in rain, fog, mystery. The acting is decent as is the story. The cinematography does a great job of depicting the isolation, along with creepy noises and screenshots to ramp up the excitement.\n\nI suggest you give it a view. Not a bad flick.\n\nEnjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the film at what I think was the third of three screenings at the Sundance Film Festival Tuesday night. I had modest expectations -- that were exceeded. The film&apos;s clearly not a glossy documentary, but it&apos;s certainly a cut above watching someone else&apos;s home movies. Copeland did a fine job of making the viewer feel included in the inner circle and created a fascinating document of a band&apos;s rise in popularity.\n\nEveryone Stares is surprisingly poignant: you see the early camaraderie and friendship strain under the pressures of success and increased commercial expectations. Some reviewers have commented negatively on the story stopping before Synchronicity. I, on the other hand, think the core pieces of the story were told without embracing the final album (which, I&apos;ll add, is my least favorite of the five).\n\nThe soundtrack was inventive and enjoyable: Copeland deconstructed and remixed Police tracks, providing dubbed-out, looped versions that I really enjoyed both as film music and on its own.\n\nFrom a music archivist point of view, it&apos;s unique and fascinating how Copeland managed to document as much as he did. Unlike a contrived &quot;making of&quot; video, this footage feels intimate and natural.\n\nHere&apos;s how I&apos;d sum this up: if you&apos;re predisposed to like The Police in the first place, you&apos;ll likely enjoy this movie. If not, well, there are other documentaries that probably relate to things you&apos;re interested in.",

I haven&apos;t seen this movie for quite a while now but I enjoyed it when I did and if you are a Sharpe fan, which I darn well hope you are, then you should get to one of those really really good video stores and rent this title, along with the others.

In that one, it was worse; in that movie the same HOUR kept repeating as opposed to the same DAY repeating, not to mention that that flick was NON-comedy. Anyway, I was glad to see that that this film had some comedic elements.  I like to find my favorite line in a movie.  In this one, it would have to be where his mom calls, and Barry tells his mom &quot;I can&apos;t talk right now, mom. The day&apos;s repeating&quot; and hangs up. I saw it when it ORIGINALLY came on TV, so I don&apos;t remember it much, but I do remember I thought it was 2 hours well spent. \n\nOn a side note, I saw Groundhog Day after this movie.  Groundhog Day is different enough from this movie so you can watch both and not feel like you&apos;re having the day repeat. (sorry, COULDN&apos;T resist)."

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re one of those people who quite enjoyed &quot;La Pacte des Loups&quot; (Brotherhood of the Wolf) a few years back but were left disappointed by some of the more ridiculous historical inaccuracies, then you might want to take a look at Romasanta.\n\nThe story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta is quite a well known one in Spain. It happened in the mid-nineteenth century, when a string of violent deaths took place which seemed in some ways like animal attacks, and in others like cold and calculated murder. Eventually a man was arrested -- Manuel Romasanta, and it was found that he used the body fat from his victims to make soap. At his trial he claimed that he became a werewolf, and that it is the nature of a wolf to kill. He was diagnosed with the psychological condition of lycanthropy, and given a life sentence rather than death.\n\nThe film itself is based largely on truth, partly on speculation and partly on pure invention for artistic purposes. It&apos;s certainly a lot closer to the truth than &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; was, anyway. One character is knowingly invented, and some rather unlikely theories are put forward in the place of that which is unknown, but the question of whether or not Romasanta was actually a werewolf is left completely open. Paco Plaza appears to be a competent and innovative director, and the style of the film is really superb. It is quite slow moving, and arguably it&apos;s rather light on actual story and plot, but that&apos;s about as far as the criticism goes.\n\nThere are several great performances, but the standout comes from Julian Sands as the title character, who submerges himself in the role in the way that only outstanding actors can. John Sharian is also very good as the misguided, haunted &apos;partner&apos; of Romasanta, and both Gary Piquer and David Gant are memorable in supporting roles as those who finally bring the murderer to justice. It also features Elsa Pataky as the leading heroine, who has become a huge sex symbol in Spain and it isn&apos;t hard to see why -- think along the lines of a Spanish Keira Knightley.\n\nThis is the finest historical werewolf film I&apos;ve ever seen, and any self-respecting werewolf buff should take a look, but unfortunately there&apos;s not much chance of this one being a blockbuster.",

But from the gitgo he&apos;s saddled with a responsibility of his own making. His 14 year old son Edward Furlong runs away from the uncle he&apos;s been staying with and hooks up with Bridges. \n\nSad to say but it&apos;s like they&apos;re doomed from the start. They live in an SRO hotel on Seattle&apos;s seamier side. Bridges is working as a window washer, barely making ends meet. Furlong tries to enroll in school, but the bureaucracy proves too much. He falls in with a lot of street kids including child hooker Tracey Kapisky who reminds me very much of Jodie Foster in Taxi. She&apos;s lives in the same SRO with her mother who&apos;s in the same profession and jealous of her daughter.\n\nBridges also has a younger associate, Don Harvey who&apos;d like to get him back in the criminal life. He&apos;s also found a bit of romance with a prison pen pal in Lucinda Jenney.\n\nAmerican Heart is a real downer of a film, but very well done. Sad to these are very real people. But oddly enough it follows the same plot line as the Shirley Temple movie Now and Forever with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard. Sort of like an R-rated version of it.\n\nThis film is not one for those who like happy endings. Still I think it is one Jeff Bridges finest screen achievements.",

Truly, there is no way to improve upon the achievement that this film represents, whether in casting, direction, writing, artistic value, you name it.\n\nThe story gives us a fascinating look into the struggles faced by George VI on his way to becoming king of England. The story line is all about his stuttering, but underneath all that are suppressed memories from childhood, growing up in the shadow of an elder brother, perpetual negative reinforcement from a domineering father, etc. It&apos;s a psychoanalytical look at a well-known royal family, and while I can&apos;t vouch for its absolute veracity, it gives a rare glimpse into the lives of people we wouldn&apos;t otherwise observe at this level of intimacy (much like &quot;Queen&quot; did a few years ago).\n\nThe contrast between George and Edward VIII is most fruitful. It&apos;s the clash between duty and hedonism, fulfilling one&apos;s personal quest for happiness vs. overcoming one&apos;s worst fears on behalf of your people and country. Edward is typically romanticized and lionized, but here we see him as more of a spoiled, selfish lout.\n\nBut the heart of the movie is the relationship between George and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who is helping him overcome his speech problems. Both actors are at the absolute top of their form. Firth is brilliant as the aloof, initially reluctant and distrustful monarch, while Rush shows the same wink-of-the-eye humor and irony that he did as Barbossa, relishing the sheer inequality of their positions yet knowing the extent to which George is dependent on him. Ultimately a true friendship develops between the men, and since they are both such endearing characters, it&apos;s a joy to watch.\n\nI should add that Helena Bonham-Carter is also spot-on as the haughty yet practical queen consort. Other more minor roles are effectively played (e.g., Winston Churchill, George V). The entire movie is a perfect blend of history, personal and familial drama, with broader themes of perseverance and overcoming adversity which give it a timeless application.\n\nLastly, in this movie&apos;s case, the &quot;R&quot; rating is for &quot;Ridiculous.&quot; The only potentially offensive material is some over-the-top language (including the F-word) which plays a part in one scene, and is clearly used for comic purpose and with great effect. I unhesitatingly took my 13 year old daughter and (depending on the child) might be okay for even younger ones. Don&apos;t let that stop you from seeing this gem.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a big fan of the documentaries about the common, a little crazy but very likable junk dealer brothers from Westerwald in Germany. Though they polarize in Germany because of their &quot;hillbilly&quot; attitude, they have masses of true fans (like me). The most wacky part of the Ludolf family (though there still is Sabine,their sister and the fifth Ludolf child, still alive) are GÃ¼nter, Manfred, Uwe and Peter, who have been accompanied by a camera team, portraying their eccentric way of life around &quot;routine&quot; work on their automotive junkyard, and crazy ideas, involving their favorite toys: cars. In each of the regular (television-) episodes they have crazy ideas around old and often rare cars. Mostly Manfred, the &quot;artist&quot; and youngest brother of them, is responsible for (wacky) re-styling of them, which almost every time includes a &quot;fancy&quot; paint job. They are doing with them all kinds of technical testings, little races, contest etc. In very few episodes, they also go on road trips - and in one season they even have been abroad (The Netherlands). In this full feature presentation it&apos;s mostly the same scheme of the average TV format - and it contains everything people may like (or dislike) about the Ludolfs, except for the fact, that there was a noticeable higher budget: They used dollies and high cranes for filming, they had pyrotechnics/sfx for the first time (a huge explosion) - and even a fresh score. Not to forget that our protagonists are going on their furthest trip so far... A good movie, you won&apos;t be disappointed - IF you like the Ludolfs.",

      "reviewBody": "Was just a little kid back in the 70s, but, boy, compared to the depressive and limited doldrums of this year, 2020, what a free spirited and special time it was.\n\nEven I remember this song being played EVERYWHERE and anywhere: radios, cars, family gatherings, TV spots etc. So much so that I find it strange that we hardly hear it today unless we are playing it from our personal collection or looking for it online etc. I mean this was literally THE biggest hit of 1977, and definitely in the top ten for the entire decade. If we are constantly hearing The BeeGees or Donna Summer, why not this?\n\nThat very question is what prompted me to watch the film on YouTube. I do remember seeing it on TV in the 80s sometime. I wasn&apos;t expecting much and that&apos;s probably why I really enjoyed it! The song-and the album if the same name that exploded for Debbie Boone-is special to me as it makes me remember my late mother and aunts and the late 70s childhood I had. But...however cliche, the film is more than a movie capitalizing on a monster hit song, which I assumed it would be. It is really moving at times and Didi Conn does a fabulous job of getting us to feel her experiences which range from frustrating to hilarious. The relationship with her dad also feels very genuine. It really takes us back to a time that most took for granted how good of a life it was. It you are in the mood for some nostalgia escapism--this is a perfect fix.",

The third time was not the charm.\n\nI must say, either my tastes have gotten much more discriminating or this cast is getting worse with each picture. I find Ashley Tisdale about as screechy and annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard, and she was worse than ever in HSM3. Ditto Corbin Bleu, so cheerful and peppy that it gets a little sickening. All of the &quot;actors&quot; come off like over-eager stage-children, but those two are probably the worst offenders. None of the case- and I mean none- are believable as real, human high school students.",

In addition the all the visual appeal, the music is not to be missed.\n\nThis is a film that you will either love or hate, that&apos;s what it comes down to. I think that if you enjoyed Eternal Sunshine (Vergiss mein nicht) you will enjoy Liebe. There is a balance of raw emotion coupled with the humour that is always missing from straight up dramas.\n\nThe problem people seem to have with this film is the distinction between whether we are supposed to think that Dietl is making a joke or if he is serious about the possible existence of eternal love, die einzige groÃe Liebe I&apos;m Leben. I believe that Deitl wants to show us that it&apos;s possible, but that humans inevitably screw it up.",

      "reviewBody": "The second half of last year meant for many, especially for those of us who lived in the half of Europe which fell under the control of the communist dictatorships imposed by the former Soviet Union, the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain and of the Berlin Wall. The events were celebrated and remembered with documentary films and speeches by politicians, but on this occasion we could see how few people remember how the world was before 1989, with the divided Europe, the ideological polarization, the Cold War, and most of all the dull and hopeless life in the countries of the communist bloc. Some, the young people or those who lived in the West, did not know it. Others seem to want to forget. Reviewing movies like &apos;The Legend of Rita&apos; (German title is &apos;Die Stille nach dem SchuÃ&apos;) can make a contribution against forgetting. The film made in 2000 by the German director Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff returns 25 years after his great success &apos;The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum&apos; to the theme of terrorism in Germany in the 70s, presenting it from the perspective of those who at one time or another were small wheels in the mechanisms of history, and which must live the rest of their lives the consequences of their acts of youth and of their adherence to a murderous ideology.\n\nHanna Arendt was writing about the &apos;banality of evil&apos;. It can be said that SchlÃ¶ndorff expands her idea in this film and that he performs a kind of &apos;humanization of evil&apos;. The two main characters in the &apos;The Legend of Rita&apos; are Rita Vogt, a young woman from western Germany, involved in robberies and armed attacks, some of them resulting in the death of innocents and Erwin Hull, a communist bureaucrat serving Stasi security services in eastern Germany. Both are executors in a totalitarian terrorist mechanism. She is an anarchist terrorist, he is an agent of state terrorism. On the one hand both serve anti-capitalist ideologies through violent means without manifesting too many moral scruples, on the other hand they both aspire to a normality of their lives in complete contradiction with the goals of the organizations and of he system they serve. Does SchlÃ¶ndorff absolve them from guilt? I do not think so, because it is very clear in the film that everything that happens around contradicts the supposed humanistic ideals of the system. It can be said that the two characters are the only ones in the film who still believe in ideology, who do not understand or accept the changes that are happening around them. The refusal to assume any personal responsibility for the actions committed in the name of the &apos;cause&apos; is also the root of their personal failures.\n\nBetween a prologue that presents Rita&apos;s terrorist activities in the mid-1970s and the epilogue that happens immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, most of the film describes the main heroine&apos;s attempt to build a new life, under cover, in a anti-Western activist protection program sponsored by Stasi. Against the course of history, she travels the opposite way to the one made by hundreds of thousands of East Germans who during the Cold War took refuge in the west. &apos;The Legend of Rita&apos; belongs to the category of German films that reconstitute life in the so-called German Democratic Republic, being a more sober variant of the excellent &apos;Good Bye Lenin!&apos; The two actors who play the lead roles (Bibiana Beglau and Martin Wuttke) as well as the whole team around them seemed excellent. The directorial performance is remarkable both in terms of the ambience details, and especially of the characters psychologies. Rita&apos;s attempts to restore her life manage to create, perhaps unmerited emotion and empathy towards the character. Neither personal happiness nor peace of mind are possible for those who compromise by collaborating with a crooked system. SchlÃ¶ndorff does not avoid controversy, his intention seems more to open the discussion, but the main idea to me seemed clear.",

All of the supporting characters/actors, in both the sophisticated/big-city/New York setting, and in rural Vermont, are well-cast and likable as well. Keaton and co-star Sam Shepard are also engaging as a couple, with humorous contentions at first, and the romance soon following.\n\nThe rapidity and degree of her success in her Vermont business venture are somewhat unbelievable (even despite her prestigious business background), but so what?\n\nSimply a thoroughly enjoyable, funny, pleasant and uplifting viewing.",

This was Earp&apos;s persona. Robards, although older than the real Holliday was at the time, also does well. I&apos;m not so sure if the real Holliday was concerned with Earp losing his character. He was a loyal friend who was in it for a pound. \n\nRobert Ryan is a superior actor, but Clanton wasn&apos;t a land baron. Clanton was a rustler/rancher, loud-mouth/coward that provoked the gunfight at the O.K.corral and lost the case for the prosecution by being a not-too-bright liar. I don&apos;t know if Ryan could be cast correctly to portray the real Ike Clanton.But he does well regardless. Earp also didn&apos;t really kill Ike.\n\nThis movie does explore the vigilante ride of Wyatt and Doc after the wounding of Virgil and the killing of Morgan Earp. Pete Spence was never a sheriff, and Sherm McMasters was a cowboy that informed for Wyatt. The movie is a superior western and as close to accurate as Hollywood came until &quot;Tombstone&quot; and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. \n\nThe mood is somewhat interesting but it wasn&apos;t a moral struggle for Wyatt and Doc in real life. They were doing what they felt was right, vengeance. Earp thought in very black and white terms, killing his brothers killers was the right thing to do in his mind. It didn&apos;t matter if it was against the law he often swore to protect as a peace officer in those western boom towns. He was always upright and correct in his profession as a lawman, but in matters of family he was not on the job and no longer wearing a badge. his duty to law enforcement no longer applied.",

That was the only interest in this film.\n\nI always didn&apos;t liked Vera Farmiga. I thought that her acting is awful since she feels so much about her look when she is acting. I never saw her getting into her character truly.\n\nBut in this film she was pretty good. At the beginning,she was not so good as usual. But as time goes by, I felt that she is feeling what her character needs and wants.\n\nI still don&apos;t think that it&apos;s her hidden ability that made this possible but rather her effort working with the director.\n\nAbove all, I was very impressed about the film. There are a lot of layers in the story, each characters&apos; emotion and of course the light and shadow in the mis-en-scene.\n\nIt&apos;s a wonderful art movie."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983) Rated &quot;R&quot; by the MPAA for Adult Situations, Profanity, Brief Nudity, Some Violence, Minor Gore, Brief Drug Use &amp; Underage Alcohol Use. Running Time 1hr&amp;34mn. My Take: ***1/2 (Out of ****)\n\n&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; just might be Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s most overlooked film. \n\nThis movie, based on the Susan E. Hinton novel, tells about young street tough Rusty-James (Matt Dillion) who idolizes his older brother known only as &apos;The Motorcycle Boy&apos; (Mickey Rourke). \n\nRusty-James longs for the days of rumbles and being a part of a gang. His friends are somewhat reluctant to feel the same way. His girlfriend Patty (Diane Lane) goes to an all-girl prep school. She&apos;s supportive of Rusty-James&apos; need for acceptance and wanting to be cool like his estranged brother. &quot;You&apos;re better than cool&quot;, she reminds him. &quot;You&apos;re warm!&quot; That&apos;s also a warning. Will Rusty-James heed?\n\nSubtly, this is a film about the failure of the &apos;American Dream&apos; and making choices, whether right or wrong. After all, Rusty-James&apos; family fell product of the socialization process. They live in the slums, but that may not always have been the case. The boys&apos; alcoholic father, memorably played by Dennis Hopper, was once a well-to-do lawyer earlier in life. What about the enigmatic Motorcycle Boy? Is he truly crazy? Or does he have &apos;an acute perception&apos; that drives him crazy?\n\nBrilliantly shot in black &amp; white, Stephen H. Burum&apos;s cinema-photography makes &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; feel like something out of a chaotic dream. Everything is surreal, yet relative to each other. Clouds stream by overhead symbolizing the passage of time. Clocks appear throughout the movie suggesting time-is-a-burnin&apos;. The suggestion here is: don&apos;t waste the time you do have while you still can. Stewart Copeland&apos;s almost all percussion and highly rhythmic score adds to that effect. \n\nIn &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, Coppola skillfully addresses the need to belong, to lead, to have goals, to have vision and warns not to fall deeper into an urban trap. Will Rusty-James discover what it means to step out and become his own identity before it&apos;s too late? As The Motorcycle Boy points out, &quot;If you&apos;re going to lead people, you need to have somewhere to go.&quot;\n\nThat&apos;s good advice.",

In all I expected some jumping, possible shock induced gasping/screaming, not too much gore (if any), etc. Yet none of that fell into place. I realize there wasn&apos;t much room for character development because that could ruin certain aspects of the film, but neglecting plot? Completely uncalled for. More often than not I found myself trying to predict in order to fill in gaps. It was like a high school production of a &quot;horror&quot; film; I could have laughed in more places than been intrigued or anxious. It seemed dated, low budget and had many ridiculous scenarios that go along with classic predictablity. It was a let down, a definite non-must see, and nothing you&apos;d miss out on.

But in contrast to the Harry Potter books and movies the witches in Bibi&apos;s world are well-known to normal people and are shown on the first page of the local newspaper.\n\nBut it is not right to say that Bibi Blocksberg is a Harry Potter copy. She was invented by Elfie Donnelly in the 1970s (?) and had a high success on cassettes, in comics and cartoons a long time before the rise of Harry Potter. It is very good that Elfie Donnelly wrote the script of the movie herself, so that no one else could destroy Bibi&apos;s world.\n\nBesides the young actors like Sidonie von Krosigk and Maximilian Befort famous German actors like Katja Riemann, Ulrich Noethen, Corinna Harfouch and Monika Bleibtreu make this movie worth seeing.\n\nIn fact, Germany tried to remember his own magicians after the Harry Potter hype and made a worth seeing wizard movie for families.",

Spectacular production design by Bob Welch , adding a colorful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, director&apos;s usual. Evocative and imaginative musical score with oriental influence on the glamorous dreamt images .The motion picture is brilliant and stunningly directed by Alfonso Cuaron(Children of men,Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, Great expectations). Another adaptations about this classic story are the following : the vintage version by Walter Lang(1939) with Shirley Temple and Ian Hunter(Liam Cunninghan lookalike role) and Mary Nash(Eagle-eyed Eleonora Bron character) and TV rendition (1987) by Carol Wiseman with Amelia Shankley and Nigel Havers.",

      "reviewBody": "Johnny 2.0 is an OK late &apos;90s made for television, The Sci Fi Channel, movie. If you were shelving a physical copy of the DVD, you would probably put it with Johnny Mnemonic. Despite its humble origins, made for tv, it is actually a cut above Johnny Mnemonic which got the full Hollywood treatment.\n\nJohnny Dalton, played by Jeff Fahey, regains consciousness after being in a coma for several years. He eventually discovers life is an illusion, shades of The Matrix, and that he is a clone. Rebel leader Nikki Holland, Tahnee Welch, helps Dalton to find his original un-cloned self, shades of Bladerunner, despite the secrecy and dangers.\n\nThe cast are generally up to the task. Canadian Michael Ironside as Frank Donahue, Johnny&apos;s business partner, is probably the standout actor and should be. He has been in everything from Scanners to Total Recall. He deserved more screen time. Fahey seems to have specialized in B movies though he is apparently a gifted dancer, classical and ballroom. There is no evidence of this in Johnny 2.0.\n\nThe film is well paced, the plot unnecessarily convoluted, the technical aspects are what one might expect of a low budget movie and the original musical backing, thank you Ed Tomney, and special effects make the grade.\n\nDirector Neill Fearnley keeps things well in hand and writer Wynne McLaughlin provides the cast plenty to work with.\n\nThe film had a European release as, Fac Simile, and did a little business.\n\nIf you are new to the genre or an old Sci Fi hand, Johnny 2.0 is a worthwhile way of spending 93 minutes. It&apos;s not earth shaking but OK.",

      "reviewBody": "The city is Nanjing, then capital of China. The time is 1937-38 when Japanese forces occupied the place. The story is the horrific consequence of that occupation for Chinese soldiers and civilians alike. The film is dedicated to the 300,000 victims of the atrocity, a figure that is still debated. The executions, the hangings, the beheadings, the burning, the bayoneting, the burying alive, the rapes - all of which happened - are all shown, but not overly dwelt upon. Instead young Lu Chuan, who both wrote and directed, tells a human story, focusing on a limited number of individuals, not all Chinese. This 2009 work was originally shot on colour film and then desaturated into black and white and the cinematography by Yu Cau is very impressive.\n\nWe are offered politically correct depictions of the bravery of the Chinese soldiers and the nobility of Chinese civilians, especially the women, but the focus on the international safety zone brings to the fore the role of John Rabe, often called the German Schindler, and other nationals. Surprisingly, however, Lu gives an important role to a (fictional) young Japanese officer called Kadokawa who is shown as compassionate and horrified by what his fellow soldiers are doing - a characterisation that understandably proved controversial in China.\n\nWhen I was in Japan, where they talk of the &apos;Nanjing Incident&apos;, at the Memorial Museum in Hiroshima of all places I found that the Japanese are still downplaying the scale of this slaughter. When I was in China, where they call it the &apos;Nanjing Massacre&apos;, not least during my time in Nanjing itself the history was still live and feelings remain raw. I wish that this film could have been seen as much in Japan - which has still not faced up to its wartime crimes in the way that Germany has done - as in China and indeed Europeans and Americans should know more, as they would by viewing the film, about the rape of Nanjing."

These quirky customers include a dominatrix, and a day trader who is passionate about the TV show &quot;Different Strokes.&quot;\n\nI&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t score this film very highly for these reasons:\n\n1. The romance is a secondary theme that is not well-developed.\n\n2. The primary story--the sale of the pills--is disjointed.\n\n3. The characters are weak. Some of their behavior is inappropriate to the character. I wish Monica Keene, who played Petunia, could have been used more. Kristen Bell&apos;s talents were wasted.\n\n4. Some jokes have obvious punchlines.\n\n5. The background music often does not fit the action.\n\n6. In the early part of the film, Darren talks to the audience, narrating the action, similar to Ferris Bueller. This is not carried throughout the film; the style of the film is inconsistent.\n\nStrangely enough, the ending has some congruity. If only the entire film possessed that same quality.",

      "reviewBody": "The name of the movie is It&apos;s Complicated but the film is everything but complicated, in fact this is the simplest and lightest movie I&apos;ve seen in a very long time. It&apos;s Complicated follows the story of Jane (Streep) that during her son&apos;s graduation hooks up with her ex-husband Jake (Baldwin)and at the same time she is dating Adam, her architect. The movie has some good moments of humor but the situations tends to repeat over and over making the movie a little boring. The story is kinda predictable and the plot is a bit lame and corny but the movie is worthy because of its cast. Actors like Alec Baldwin and Steve Maritn and an actress like Meryl Streep make it a real joy. Their performances are excellent and so funny. In conclusion, It&apos;s complicated is a movie mostly intended for people over 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s. Women will love it and men will enjoy it also",

(is there any other kind?) But he, his daughter, and the family doctor who cares for and loves her, are all hiding a terrible secret...and there&apos;s a reason why the wax statues of famous villainous women all look so lifelike! When the pretty, innocent girl from the nearby village, (whom our hero has fallen in love with, despite the best efforts of Creepy Girl) goes mysteriously missing, it&apos;s off to the mill to learn the terrible truth! \n\nThis is a dreamy, sometimes slow-moving, but never disappointing film which features a great &quot;acid trip&quot; sequence and the surprising nudity of several buxom young hotties. Should not be missed by fans of the colorful Italian, Hammer- esque genre. Wonderfully atmospheric and genuinely creepy. Great stuff!",

Not a dark film as Melville, but a good ol&apos; saturday night detective film as many were produced in the 50&apos;s. In this one, the pernicious effects of the association cop/informer make your head spin. Corneau don&apos;t success everyway the delicate osmosis between public and private life, but he films very good the cop himself - Alain Chabat - as used by tiredness and remorse."

      "name": "One of the best sci-fi films around",
      "reviewBody": "This film was actually the first sequel to use a number in the title (although it&apos;s American title was &quot;Enemy from Space&quot;). Not only was this a cleverly written film, based on Nigel Kneale&apos;s screenplay, but it was a cruel satire on English and American culture in the 1950s.\n\nIn a nutshell, Professor Bernard Quatermass, leader of England&apos;s rocket group, is at wit&apos;s end trying to get more funding for his projected moon project. The British government decides it has &quot;projects of far greater importance.&apos;&apos; At the same time, workers at Quatermass&apos; base detect scores of what look like meteorites falling close by. When Quatermass investigates, he not only finds remnants of the meteorites, but his moon base, conveniently appropriated by an unknown government entity. His lab assistant picks up one of the meteorites and it explodes in his face, immediately infecting him with an alien parasite.\n\nQuatermass is forced to go it almost alone, helped by a cynical police inspector, a drunken beat reporter and a vigilant member of parliament who can&apos;t get even his own party members to question where millions of pounds of tax dollars are going to.\n\nThe cruel satire comes from the comparison of Western governments of the 1950s to the communist governments they vehemently opposed during the Cold War years. British citizens were taught to implicitly trust government even as it spent millions to unknowingly fund an alien invasion. Civilian workers were so glad to have jobs they don&apos;t question why the supposed &quot;synthetic food&quot; plant they&apos;re building needs huge doses of toxic gases like ammonia. Even when evidence of wrongdoing is brought up, government red tape squelches it.\n\nAs for the movie itself, it is much better written than the original (&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;). Nigel Kneale softens Quatermass&apos; dour and brusk personality. Director Val Guest effectively uses a string musical score to build a creepy atmosphere. He and Kneale even overcome the first movie&apos;s dull ending, which had an alien getting electrocuted with no suspense whatsoever. Here, the plant workers, angry that one of their own is carted away by infected security guards at gunpoint, try to storm the plant, turning the aliens&apos; carefully planned invasion on its ear. The irony, of course, is that the plant was conceived because government bureaucracy kept it secret. Now, as the plant is threatened, the same secrecy prevents the aliens from calling for help from the police or armed forces.\n\nThe special effects are better in this film, though the giant aliens at the end are not as convincing as they could be. Still, the film is a great example of British science fiction, which relied more on plot and characterization than the special effects that dominated American science fiction."

When you go into the castle there is a woman (maybe a man some days) there is characters from Shrek in the room with you. There is a TV screen which shows The Gingerbreadman running away and then the ghost appears on screen. Oh, but before you go in they give you special glasses (to make everything look 3-D). You seat in seats that jerk every once in a while. It is very fun and if your there check it out if your a fan of Shrek or not.",

      "reviewBody": "Black Adam is everything anyone hoped it was really. Its a fun and thrilling action packed superhero movie.\n\nDwyane Jhonson plays a somewhat stoic antihero and is elevated by his cast mainly the actors for Hawkman and Dr Fate who are the standout in this movie. Though i would have liked to seen more of Atom Smasher and Cyclone because theyre barely in the movie. The mythos of Black Adam is something most people will find interestig as well. And the film does a good job of introducing new characters and places and overall expanding the DCEU.\n\nSo did the heiracrchy in DC universe change? Well kinda. This film may be fun and pretty violent at times. And I can see it doing really well in the box office. The critics are most probably not gonna like this movie as it is a bit messy at times and the stoic performance by the ROCK may not be the cup of tea for everyone. But for an average joe who doesnt keep up with their daily cup of critical pretentiousness, and just wants to spend some time watching badass superheroes being badass. This is the film for you.\n\nIts no &apos;Batman Begins&apos; but it never wants to be. Fun but flawed is the best description i can give it. I really enjoyed it. And most people will certainly do aswell.\n\nAnd also, stay for the post credits. You wont be disappointed.",

It looks and feels like a Guy Richie movie so if you liked those you&apos;ll enjoy the &apos;American version&apos; replete with slow motion shotgun blasted dude flying through the air in slow motion in the apartment. But if you think it&apos;s all about violence think again, this film is pure jokes and cameos(cassidy, mos def, debbie allen etc.)with lots of herb smoking and hard hip-hop backdrops. And besides, who hasn&apos;t fantasized about hog-tying and slapping the UPS guy? I know I have. Did I mention the dude from Family Matters is in it and totally kicks @##!?",

He has masculine appeal making Ellen fall for him, however he is not quite responsible, which she lives to regret. Her trustfulness is thoroughly misused by the cunning Gunnar, and we are filled with sympathy for this unhappy old maid, who just wants to experience a bit of warmth and tenderness before it is too late. Ellen&apos;s fate is also hardened by a shrewd employee in the laundry shop, who takes care of his own demands on her account. The film benefits from a lively precise dialog and numerous fine details underway. Petrine Sonne as usual steals the picture when she comes around as Ellens loving old working companion. The drama is carried solely by Ellen Gottschalck delivering a performance of dignity and pride.",

I have been reviewing the films they distribute for a while now, and they have been consistently good. &quot;Stool Pigeon&quot; is no exception, adding the genre of police action to the martial arts stories they have delivered us in the past. I assume not all Asian films are this good (in fact, I know they are not), so whoever does acquisitions for Well Go needs a raise.\n\nWhat is this film? A bit of mystery, a lot of action, a crime thriller. It really should appeal to a wide audience. If you like films like &quot;French Connection&quot; or &quot;Snatch&quot;, I think this will be your film. While not quite a masterpiece, it really does tell a strong, interesting and emotional story. It is a film I am eager to watch a second time.\n\nThe DVD/BD (it comes as a combo pack) has some nice features on, most notably the variety of languages and subtitles. You might prefer Cantonese with English subtitles. Perhaps you prefer English dubbing. Then again, maybe you speak Cantonese and would rather watch it without dubbing or subs... you are able to do any of these."

The locations and images are beautiful! And the way they merged the first two books into one story was good! now for the bad aspects: who the hell wrote Amarillis like this? and who casted Barbara SchÃ¶neberger into this role??? Every single child in the movie did a better job. perhaps she couldn&apos;t do better because she was told to act just this way, but I really didn&apos;t like it... btw: could someone please take away this mirror from her? mirrors belong to other stories or just left to RÃ¼diger Hoffmann ;-) But the most important fact: even if I didn&apos;t like the movie the children did and it was fun joining them on the same movie :-)",

Daniels.\n\nChase&apos;s &apos;Dr. Broadway&apos; had provided the basis for Mann&apos;s first film and Mann had been suggested by Stewart to direct &apos;Winchester &apos;73&apos; after Fritz Lang had pulled out, feeling that Stewart was unsuitable casting(!) These three were made for each other with Borden&apos;s writing and Mann&apos;s direction perfectly suited to Stewart&apos;s tougher, more cynical post-war persona.\n\nAn outstanding element in Mann&apos;s westerns is the sometimes uneasy relationships between men and women in a milieu of action and violence and this film is certainly no exception with a fascinating dynamic between the equally self-willed characters played by Stewart and Ruth Roman whilst Stewart is particularly gifted at portraying the emotional ambivalence of the action hero.\n\nThe supporting characters, although stereotypical, are given true substance by Walter Brennan, Jay C. Flippen, a chilling Robert J. Wilkie and a gloriously unsavoury John McIntire.\n\nThe film&apos;s intensity, brutality and final shoot out look ahead to Mann&apos;s final and arguably greatest western, &quot;Man of the West&apos;.\n\nMann&apos;s films of this period were alas destined to be underrated by the &apos;cultivated&apos; American critics but were at least appreciated by the French whilst much-loved James Stewart reigns as one of Hollywood&apos;s most complete actor-personalities.",

His former superiors believe that he is close to getting the formula all for himself, so they send one of his old friends to convince him to cooperate with them again. You have to give &quot;A Ticket To Die&quot; credit for capturing the feel of a &quot;serious&quot; spy movie, from the raincoats that all the men wear to the footsteps sometimes being the only sound. However, the story is muddled (characters and incidents are introduced and then left unresolved), the direction is static, and the hero is OK but rather colorless. Hardcore fans of mid-1960s Euro-spy fare may like parts of this film, but others will probably find it too dull to sit through. *1/2 out of 4.",

      "reviewBody": "**SPOILERS** Meeting quite by accident at the Milford train station British housewife Laura Jesson, Celi Johnson, got a speck of grit stuck in her eye that fellow passenger Dr. Alec Harvey,Trevor Howard, quickly came to her aid and washed out. Alec then slowly starts to get these strong feeling about the sweet and somewhat shy, as well as married, middle-age woman that in no time at all turns into an uncontrollable, by both Laura as well as Alec, love affair that in the end if not checked my well break up both of their marriage&apos;s.\n\nEven though both Alec and Laura are married, not to each other, we only get to see Laura&apos;s husband and family in the movie which is shown in a long flashback, that takes up almost the entire film, from only Laura&apos;s point of view. After that innocent meeting at the train station the two always end up meeting on a Thursday when Laura travels to Milford to buy groceries and Alec has the afternoon off from work. Alec a doctor at the Milford hospital has a wife and family who we never get to see but sense are very much in love with him. Alec&apos;s life starts to take a sudden turn away from them as he starts to slowly fall in love with Laura.\n\nYou never once get the impression that Alec and Laura are willing to leave their wife and husband so that they can get married to each other. The two star-struck lovers only want to keep their affair secret and live double-lives but the guilt of the affair consumes Laura. For the first time in her marriage Laura lied to her husband Fred, Cyril Raymond, about her being in love with another man. Even though she admitted it to Fred in an almost whimsical way, that Fred took as a joke, Laura also realized that no matter how much she was in love with Alec, and he with her, in the end it would only lead to nothing but heartbreak for her as well as everyone, Alec together with her and his families, involved. \n\nIt was later when Alec got a job at his brothers new hospital in Johannesburg South Africa that both he and Laura could finally break up their affair by the two never having to as much as cross their paths again. Even saying goodbye to each other for the last time was never to happen when the two were interrupted at the train station by Laura&apos;s chatter-house friend Dolly Mesitter, Everly Gregg. Dolly&apos;s non-stop talking prevented the two from having the last few minutes together with each other but at the same time also prevented Laura from throwing herself on the tracks, by momentarily keeping her mind off the fact that Alec was about to leave her, as Alec&apos;s train left the station. \n\nExtremely moving adult drama about two persons who find out only too late in life that they were meant for each other but missed the boat, or train, when it came into the station and have to do with what they have: try to forget they ever met no matter how much sorrow and grief it would bring them. Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were touchingly effective as the star-struck lovers Laura and Alec who knew that their affair was doomed from the start and just had to accept what fate had handed them: try to forget that brief encounter they had one fateful evening in the railroad station outside of Milford.",

      "reviewBody": "This time around, Bronson is a Russian major sent to the USA to eliminate a renegade Stalinist who is activating human time bombs. It&apos;s a kind of Manchurian Candidate times twelve. Bronson&apos;s double-agent assistant is Lee Remick.\n\nThe plot, though not hard to follow, is a bit intricate and involves the solution of several puzzles and a good deal of travel around the country, from Denver to Akron to Los Angeles to Cambridge (NM), to some dumpy bar in rural Texas with a rattlesnake in a cage. The series is designed to spell out the name of the villain, Dalchimsky, across a map of the USA. It&apos;s not worth going into enough detail to explain exactly what that means. But I must add that I thought it was pretty rotten of the director to actually blow that rattlesnake&apos;s head off for real, Crotalus atrox, a beautiful specimen. Where is PETA when you need them? And what do they have against snakes? Oh, sure, nobody would argue that rattlesnakes are as cuddly as French poodles or sea otters -- but, still. \n\nBronson is his usual self with his built-in swagger and mustache. He&apos;s a Russian major and his hair looks styled by Mister Kenneth or something. And he&apos;s completely incapable of projecting anxiety, let alone fear. Lee Remick was no longer a teenage baton twirler but she has the strangest, most appealing pair of pale blue eyes, surrounded by black circles, like Meg Ryan&apos;s. And she too has a curious rolling gait, like a sailor&apos;s. Neither Bronson nor Remich was ever a major star by Hollywood standards but they&apos;re both engaging and it&apos;s sad to think that they are now both history. I could never get with Donald Pleasance as an actor. He&apos;s probably a fine man and loves his dog, but his shining dome and pop eyes become banal in a hurry. Sheree North in her small part gives a good impression of being an exuberantly sexy no-nonsense woman.\n\nThe plot has its implausibilities. We kind of expect Bronson and Remick to wind up together somehow, and they do, but it comes out of nowhere. Bronson has heretofore done no more than smile at Remick, and that only once, when suddenly they get in the car and take off for a motel ten miles away. \n\nA couple of fireballs for the young at mind, but no car chases, no slow motion deaths (except for that disenfranchised rattler), and only one shooting. \n\nThis is one of about two Bronson vehicles I look forward to seeing again. I&apos;m not sure why. Schifrin&apos;s music is no more than adequate. The photography is interesting, all of its colors drawn from the red end of the spectrum, all beige, gray, orange, and scarlet. Anyone in blue looks like a tramp at a Kandinsky exhibit. Maybe I like the irony of a Russian major trying to save the USA from being blown up.",

      "reviewBody": "The Sun Behind the Clouds&quot;: Tibet&apos;s Struggle for Freedom&quot; viewed at the LA Indian film festival, 2012, was made by Tibetan/Indian filmmakers Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin to commemorate the half century since the Dalai Lama&apos;s enforced flight from Tibet in 1960 to Dharamsala, India, where he set up a Tibetan government in exile. Ever since, His Holiness has traveled all over the world to promote the cause of Tibetan independence and peace in general, being treated everywhere with the kind of reverence usually reserved for living saints like Mahatma Ghandi in--revered by everyone except the Chinese, who regard him as an upstart, troublemaker, and enemy of the (Chinese) People. \n\nThe current film, covers a long freedom march in 2009 made by the Tibetans of Dharamsala to Lhasa (they never got there), features a number of direct interviews with the Dalai Lama in various world cities, Tibetan protests against the 2008 Beijing Olympics and Chinese counter-protesters, and numerous interviews with Tibetan residents of China proper who were imprisoned for daring to speak out against the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the suppression of Tibetan culture. \n\nWith a total population of around six million as opposed to the billion plus of the Chinese, most Tibetans realize that full independence for Tibet is not a very realistic goal and even the DL himself has pulled back to a milder position, which he calls a Middle Road, where at least religious autonomy would be granted the Tibetans, and the Dalai Lama would be permitted to return as their religious leader. This Middle of the Road position has caused a split among Tibetans themselves -- those who crave full independence at any cost, and those willing to follow the DL in accepting Chinese dominion with certain concessions. Meanwhile the Chinese have flooded Tibet with &quot;Han&quot; settlers to the point where the Tibetans have become a numerical minority in their own country, much as the Gringos flooded the Mexican state of &apos;Tejas&apos; at one time to overwhelm the locals and turn it into the solid American American state of Texas. Even the Dalai Lama&apos;s currently more moderate stance is unacceptable to the Chinese as they consider him to be a walking excuse for a revolution if they ever let him back in. \n\nRare, undoubtedly smuggled footage, shows violent protests against the Chinese occupiers in the capital, Lhasa, and their brutal suppression by PRC troops. While this film is clearly a call for sympathy for the cause of Tibetan freedom, through stock footage easily available from Chinese TV we also see very articulate Chinese political commentators clearly stating the Chinese position on their need to retain Tibet as an integral part of China. All in all this 79 minute film is so compactly organized that it seems to be twice that long, offering a full course on &quot;Imperialist China, 101, 2010&quot; as well as a solid history of Tibet since the Chinese intrusion of 1950. Older viewers may hear faint echoes of a time when a guy named Adolph convinced the West that he needed a small country called Czechoslovakia to protect the German residents living there. The Tenzing-Sarin duo made a feature film in 2005 entitled &quot;Dreaming Lhasa&quot; which attracted some festival attention, but &quot;The Sun Behind the Clouds&quot; (A reference to the hope that one day Freedom will again come to Tibet) is a far stronger piece of work that soars high in the skies of documentary film making here in the first decade of the XXIst century. It needs to be widely seen, not only for its deft but chillingly full unveiling of Chinese totalitarianism (which America continues to mollie-coddle), but also as a brilliant piece of documentary film expertise. From here &quot;Sun behind the clouds&quot; goes to the Washington DC film festival and looks like it is going to have long festival legs in the months to come",

      "reviewBody": "This film has won so many awards and it deserves every single one of them. Set in Tokyo in 1958 at the time of the construction of the Tokyo Tower, the story depicts a few families in that neighborhood and the things they go through. It has both comic turns and, once in a while, sad references. It is also overtly sentimental at times, but the emotional power of the film never wanes, and it is just a feel great film. The acting is excellent. There are real glimpses into the meaning of family, love and caring, and just generally sharing your time together. If you think you are going to watch this film and promise yourself you will not be sucked in by its sentiment, you are missing the point. Its supposed to make you laugh and cry. Although Tokyo has demonstrably changed since 1958 (I went there in May 2008, you wouldn&apos;t be able to find traces of this existence), this is a period film which just works wonderfully. It was so successful, a sequel was done. I&apos;m going to watch that, since, based on this film alone, I want to see what happens to these characters from here. That is how great the film is, that one film alone is not good enough to let these characters go. Simply a triumph that deserves all the success it has achieved.",

      "reviewBody": "Seen in the World Tour sidebar at the 33rd Cleveland International Film Festival, this tells us of Mihram&apos;s efforts to upgrade his standing as an entrepreneur in mid-90&apos;s Turkey. He is a &quot;procurer&quot; of whatever people contract him for. In the first scene he has brought a man a cable to replace one recently stolen. Remarkably, the cable is the exact length required. The dawning that Mihram (who didn&apos;t do the stealing) is selling the man his own cable is a warm and funny introduction to the tale to follow. But he wants to set up a cell phone franchise, making him a legitimate merchant, and for that he&apos;ll need much more money.\n\nAn opportunity is presented to help a local doctor get needed medicines, available in neighboring Kazakhstan. This chance to improve his relationship with both God and his wife (and turn a large profit) leads Mihram on the story arc through the rest of his adventure. Deals are made, the local &quot;mafia&quot; is flouted, and an endearing Uncle is recruited to help with the smuggling.\n\nThere is a lot of humanity presented, with the characters well understood. Every interaction becomes a negotiation., whether over a card table or at a border checkpoint. The scenes of bartering are wonderfully reminiscent of watching any &quot;relative from the old country&quot; work their magic on a local merchant. All I will say about the reconcilement of the plot is that it is Indie: It makes some sense, it&apos;s a little unexpected and it&apos;s a bit ironic.",

Shortly afterward, her boyfriend (Gabriele Ferzetti) and her best friend (Monica Vitti) became attracted to each other.\n\nHowever, don&apos;t expect the mystery. This is a study of emotional isolation, moral decay, lack of the communication and emptiness of rich people in contemporary (then) society. You can easily be bored by the slow pace and the lack of dramatics of this movie unless you capture its true purpose. This is &quot;state of mind&quot; or experience film rather than conventional plot film. Antonioni practically discovered the new movie language in L&apos;Avventura. By using formal instruments he is expressing emotions of the characters (loneliness, boredom, emptiness and emotional detachment) and the viewer is forced rather to feel this same emotions himself than to be involved in the story and its events. These formal instruments are: slow rhythm, real-time events, long takes, visual metaphors like inhabited island(s), fog, extreme long shots (small characters in panorama) and putting protagonists on inhabited streets or large buildings and landscapes.\n\nGreat cinematography. Forms trilogy with La Notte (1961) and L&apos;Eclisse (1962).",

Berlin was the hub of commotion as everybody had to work.This goal was all too evident in the schematic interpretation of the script.Unser taglich brot appears credible as it agreeably mirrored working class aspirations.It can be labelled as the first true socialist film made by DEFA studios.",

What about Frey, I&apos;am always looking forward to see the film-makers imagination of her.... very disappointing. Anyway, this ways a good experience, a film cut to the bone, trustful to the story. (one last thing - a wooden door should be built with a diagonal braces starting from the top of a door - away from the hinge and downwards. ending close to the lower hinge - otherwise it would collapse within few weeks.... ohh please dont make that mistake again, Ive seen it made false soo many times)",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 2016 going on a Trump-filled 2017, and Gonzo porn rules Adult Entertainment. But sampling quality story-line XXX features from the past is enlightening, as in this fine motion picture that plays like a real movie, only with tons of explicit sex included. And that&apos;s what porn should be.\n\nThis is a post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi, the venerable genre dating back to literature like Alas, Babylon or Earth Abides, favorite reading of my youth. Director Ren Savant/Tom Elliot keeps a serious tone for 4- 1/2 hours of running time, and the acting delivers on his faith in a solid script he penned with &quot;Tony G&quot;.\n\nKayden Kross, introduced as an ideal nude beauty waking up from suspended animation, is the daughter of a scientist (played by the director himself) whose misguided efforts to create an earthly utopia instead caused a holocaust. His Zero-Point Energy Reactor upset the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, causing electricity to no longer function and killing off most of the population.\n\nKross appears to be in a space ship, where she humps studs Tommy Gunn and Aaron Wilcoxxx, but it turns out to be a bunker, near the L.A. storm sewers, and when she ventures outside the &quot;Brave New World&quot; is a photogenic (courtesy of the great star Kylie Ireland doubling as production designer) barren wasteland.\n\nKross&apos;s adventures center around two unsavory characters who take the beauty sequentially as a slave. Tyler Knight with a fascinating uber-Mr. T haircut and braids humps her first for interracial sex content, and then the late, great actress Amber Rayne steals her away and treats her to Sapphic pleasure. Rayne also delivers some great d.p. action in a subsequent threesome scene.\n\nLording it over the flies is Ameatabh Bachan in a terrific non-sex performance as Prince Amir, who holds a group of survivors in thrall in his cult-like Elysium Fields in the desert. High point of the script for me was when his right-hand Vizier played by H.M. Smith recites for the crowd some beliefs of this Luddite society, condemning: &quot;Cursed be the TV, the CDs and the Internets. Cursed be the Gates, the Jobs and the Linux&quot;.\n\nPlenty of arousing sex scenes are integrated into Kayden&apos;s saga, including Kylie Ireland in a hot sex scene of her own. Lavish production, which was issued on 4 DVDs in the manner of Adam &amp; Eve&apos;s previous all-time hit with Digital Playground &quot;Pirates&quot;, also features numerous porno greats behind the camera ranging from Ireland to Lexi Lamour and Nikki Hunter. With the possible exception of Brad Armstrong over at Wicked, Adult Entertainment doesn&apos;t support large-scale projects like this one anymore.\n\nI especially liked the ending of &quot;The 8th Day&quot;, which is set up well earlier on and delivers the nihilistic saga&apos;s exclamation point in a manner that mainstream &quot;visionary&quot; (how I hate that term!) filmmakers should envy. Highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "Third in the Universal series of Sherlock Holmes films is another strong one with a WWII plot. A British secret agent carrying important documents is kidnapped en route to Washington, D.C. The British government turns to Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) to find the agent and the documents. Together with Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce), Holmes journeys to America to investigate.\n\nRathbone and Bruce are terrific, as usual. This is the last entry in the series where Rathbone sports that silly hairstyle. George Zucco and Henry Daniell are great villains, which should surprise no one. They both played Holmes&apos; nemesis Prof. Moriarty in other films. Holmes Herbert, Thurston Hall, Gavin Muir, and Edmund Macdonald are among the fine actors in the wonderful supporting cast. Marjorie Lord provides the pretty. Strong direction from Roy William Neill.\n\nIt&apos;s a very entertaining movie. No backhanded compliments here. No &quot;best of the propaganda Holmes films&quot; or &quot;thankfully not as much flag-waving as the previous two films&quot; or any of that stuff. Unlike some other reviewers I don&apos;t respond to patriotism (especially during WWII) like the Wicked Witch responds to water. After this entry, Holmes would return to murder mysteries although still taking place in the (then) present day rather than the Victorian era, much to the consternation of Holmes purists. I have my thoughts on that but I&apos;ll just quote John Archer, the actor who played Lt. Pete Merriam in this film: &quot;Those Sherlock Holmes fans -- by God, they are rabid. They want everything to be just the way it was.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I remember being quite gutted on missing this one&apos;s limited release in November of last year, so once again, thank God for the Brixton Ritzy&apos;s European matinee&apos;s unearthing it for the week. The subject of this documentary is the use of as herbal remedies to cure serious illnesses as outlined by a series of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, These techniques are currently being used by Dr Tenzin Choedrak, personal physician to the Dalai Lama, and are beginning to arouse interest in the West, specifically in Austria, Switzerland and Israel. The area itself is a fascinating one, but the leaden approach adopted by this film ignores all documentary conventions, eschews any sort of structure and drowns the viewer in a barrage of information. The film could have done with setting out its agenda from the offset. As it is the initial scenes of Choedrak treating his patients seem both obscure and overlong. Some sort of voice over would have helped here, but instead any explanation is revealed in great torrents during the brief interview interludes with the various practitioners and researchers within the field. Without any sort of hook into the subject, one is left to derive interest from the periphery details captured on film, such as the decor of the Mongolian living room where one of the patients is treated, or the landscapes of Northern India. By the time we are introduced to the fundamentals of photochemistry by an Austrian researcher I was completely lost. Unfortunately this was about halfway through. One wonders how this ever got a theatrical release in the UK. It is the sort of thing which is done so much better by British television documentaries such as Equinox. This sort of &apos;point and shoot&apos; style does the subject no justice at all."

      "name": "Great example of Stalinist  folk art",
      "reviewBody": "Josef Stalin loved cinema, and established the Soyuzmultfilm studio in 1936 essentially to show the world that a totalitarian nation could turn out fantasy films the equal of the decadent west&apos;s super-star, Walt Disney. Traditional Russian folk-lore and the major, iconic fairy-tales of the country were given the highest priority; not only did Stalin&apos;s studios preserve Russia&apos;s classic folk heritage in the novel form of film and cartoons, but the films also served as examples of the advances of Soviet technology (and the Soyuzmultfilm animated fairy tales of the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s are indeed glorious, especially with their original, full-orchestral, old-world musical soundtracks intact).\n\nVASILISA THE BEAUTIFUL is also known in the west as &quot;The Frog Princess&quot; (as it was titled in the U.S. release of Soyuzmultfilm&apos;s ravishing animated cartoon version of 1954). But this 1939 version is LIVE ACTION (b&amp;w) and is utterly enjoyable, and striking in many ways. It is told in the typical, rather crude and straightforward manner of a folk-tale, but is extremely impressive from a visual standpoint. It is fascinating to behold the detailed recreation of a primitive, rural farmhouse, with its distinctive bell-towers and gables all fashioned of timber, basking in the brilliant sunshine and surrounded by vast wheat fields.\n\nThe old father who no longer wants to support his two lazy sons instructs them to each shoot an arrow into the air...and where it lands, each will find his new bride. His #3 son, Ivanushka (the youngest and most upstanding of them), finds his bride at the bottom of a lake inside of a big ol&apos; lily pad and takes the frog into his care, in order to honor his pact with his father. And, sure enough, the frog is actually the beautiful and elusive princess Vasilisa, who is then kidnapped by that creepy nemesis of old Russian lore, Baba Yaga the witch.\n\nIvan&apos;s quest to rescue his bride is told through some pretty impressive live-action imagery, often employing elaborate matte-like effects that combine the actors with what look like ink drawings, plus a few instances of very cool forced-perspective photography, including a stunning sequence where Baba Yaga causes the wooded cliff upon which Ivan is standing to collapse into the ravine far below. The &quot;monsters&quot; themselves are crude--a huge, giant spider that ensnares Ivan and commands that he answer three riddles in order to save his life (a pretty easy-going arachnid, since he gives Ivan multiple guesses when his first answer is wrong), and the giant, Ghidra-like, three-headed dragon (which is planning on marrying Vasilisa!). Crude, but appropriate for this nightmarish fantasy...and the landscape design is continually awesome to the eye.\n\nThen there are Ivan&apos;s pals, the bear family, who assist him in finding the magic key, crystal chest, and magic duck egg which he needs to save his beloved. Maybe there&apos;s one too many scenes relying on simply running the film backward for a &quot;magical&quot; effect, but--what-the-hey, it&apos;s 1939. And the combining of shots of the real bears and the occasional Russki in a bear-suit is well done.\n\nThe musical score is notable, since it features a THEREMIN to represent the &quot;outre&quot; elements of the story, which are numerous.\n\nWHAT I FOUND ADDITIONALLY MEANINGFUL is the &quot;Bonus Feature&quot; interview with Kiril Stolyarov, son of the famous Russian actor who stars as Ivanushka in the film; not only does he relate the story of his dad&apos;s precarious status in the eyes of the Stalinist regime (and yes, this film was made at the height of Stalin&apos;s great Terror), but the son also expounds on the emotional, cultural and moral significance of the classic, immortal Fairy-Tales (or &quot;Skazki&quot;) and their role in the history of his great nation. I found it very moving.\n\nPS--Also, check out the original Russian release of the 1956 mega-epic &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;, another iconic tale from the Motherland, but primarily known in the US in its cheesy 1960 dubbed version re-titled &quot;The Sword and the Dragon.&quot; Bizarre but insightful stuff.",

      "reviewBody": "Set in London in 1960, the aptly named &quot;Flawless&quot; features Demi Moore as Laura Quinn, the first woman to become senior negotiator at Lon Di, the world&apos;s premier diamond firm. However, Quinn has pretty much hit the glass ceiling career-wise with the company, and when she discovers that she is about to be let go from the firm, she agrees to join forces with the night janitor (Michael Caine) in his plan to rob the vault of a thermos-full of uncut diamonds.\n\n&quot;Flawless&quot; is a good old-fashioned caper tale done with an abundance of wit, intelligence and style and just enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the audience on its toes throughout. Moore and Caine make a perfect team as the duo plotting the heist, while director Michael Radford generates enough suspense for a dozen average thrillers. The script by Edward Anderson even manages to squeeze in some points about early &apos;60&apos;s feminism and South African apartheid along the way.\n\nDefinitely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Jimmy Sangster&apos;s screenplay for &quot;Nightmare&quot; is an excellent contemporary (early 1960s) thriller with Gothic touches. However, the script falters about halfway through when the young heroine Janet, who has been driven almost out of her mind by a series of terrifying events, is removed from the action of the story.\n\nInstead of centering the action of the second half on characters sympathetic to the heroine who might take up her cause, identify the conspirators and bring them to justice - as happens in, for example, &quot;Psycho&quot; - the script reveals to the audience who the conspirators are, and then, until the final scene, makes them the center of the action.\n\nIt is asking a lot of an audience to identify with those whose machinations have brought about the committal of a sympathetic heroine, and this may well explain why the second half of &quot;Nightmare&quot; is less gripping than the first - especially as the plot of the second half is a variation on what has gone before, this time with an unsympathetic character experiencing terrifying events. This part of the screenplay also stretches credibility, since it seems unlikely that an antagonist with an alert and cunning mind would not detect a plot which is dividing him from his female accomplice.\n\nThe real strength of &quot;Nightmare&quot;, however, is in director Freddie Francis&apos; visual flair. A former cameraman/director of photography, using black and white &apos;scope and obviously influenced by his work on Jack Clayton&apos;s &quot;The Innocents&quot;, he succeeds in creating a real sense of fear and isolation around his vulnerable heroine.\n\nHe achieves this by using the expanse of the &apos;scope frame, often surrounding Janet with shadows or, in daylight, setting her in a frame devoid of anything or anybody reassuring. For example: when Janet travels home from school, the railway station is almost deserted; we do not see the departing train from which she has presumably just alighted. There are no other cars on the road as she is driven home. As they pass the asylum she dreads, there are no signs of human activity within the grounds. Once back home she is dwarfed by the mansion &quot;High Towers&quot; she has become heir to, and her isolation is compounded by her home being located in remote snow-covered countryside.  \n\nJanet&apos;s isolation is social as well as physical; ostracized at boarding school in the early scenes, and clinging to a grotesque doll and a small transistor radio, she is never seen with anyone her own age (mid-teens). Her only friend at the school is a sympathetic teacher. At &quot;High Towers&quot; the guardian she dotes on, Henry Baxter, is at least twice her age - as are her other household companions.\n\nIn addition to traditional Gothic trappings (heroines wandering dark corridors in flowing night-dresses, candlelight illumination, door handles seen turning slowly and ghostly nocturnal figures) Freddie Francis endows several everyday objects with fearful connotations - Janet&apos;s doll, her transistor radio that forever blares out fast jazz, and above all, a birthday cake with lighted candles. The latter becomes a powerful image of dread, since it was on Janet&apos;s eleventh birthday the horrific event occurred that started the cycle of nightmares and fear of inherited insanity.\n\n&quot;Nightmare&quot; has a particularly bleak atmosphere: most of the action is set during a harsh winter, the dialogue has virtually no humor and the ending - which should give the audience a sense of satisfaction - is grimly downbeat. This is probably because in achieving justice for Janet, her sympathizers have virtually duplicated the methods of the conspirators and brought about a similar result - a gruesome death and a woman on the edge of madness.\n\nHighly recommended viewing.",

This episode is composed of clearly recently reconstructed scenes. So, an investigation of the episode by a filming team, comes upon an important discovery. This is a secret space program developed in the Soviet Union before World War II. Scientists and military authorities, the film would have you believe, had developed a spaceship 23 years before Yuri Gagarin ever went to space.\n\nThe amusing elements of fiction and true statements of the Stalin era the interesting features of this film, which lack continuity, not always easy to follow. I think it was intended for the intellectuals of the former Soviet Republics, particularly Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Ucraine. Its appeal, even in the festival circuit, is very limited.\n\nLacking cohesion, and depending on the non-stop loud Russian-language commentary to follow the film, it is not comprehensible to the non-Russian speaker, or a non-ex Soviet citizen in one screening. And who&apos;d want to sit through another screening. Though the idea sounds good, it will really be quite boring to most everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;There are individuals who come along in certain periods of time who advance the human spirit to the next level.&quot; â actor James Newcomb Heroes are not only those who achieve unprecedented success, but those who create possibilities for others. &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; according to Werner Erhard, &quot;are created by Âpeople who will act to make possibility real.&quot; Such an individual is Ai Weiwei (pronounced &quot;Ay Way Way&quot;) a Chinese artist and political activist whom Time Magazine named as runner-up for &quot;2011 Person of The Year.&quot; Directed by Alison Klayman, the compelling documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, winner of a Special Jury Prize at this year&apos;s Sundance Film Festival, follows Ai Weiwei pursuing his sculpture, architecture, curating, photography, film, and other arts in a political system that does not hesitate to use force, repression, and censorship against those they see as threats to the Communist government.\n\nAi Weiwei&apos;s father was Chinese poet Ai Qing who was denounced and sent to a labor camp with his wife, Gao Ying, an event that had strong repercussions in Ai&apos;s life. Ai Weiwei lived in New York from 1983 to 1993 where he studied and worked as an artist. While in New York, he created conceptual art by altering ready-made objects. He also compiled 10,000 photographs that were shown in an exhibit at the Three Shadows Photography Art Centre in Beijing and became the subject of a 20-minute film &quot;Who&apos;s Afraid of Ai Weiwei&quot; shown on PBS in 2008, a work that was expanded to produce the current documentary.\n\nUsing interviews with friends, family members, fellow artists, and young followers, Klayman describes Weiwei&apos;s involvement in the Sichuan Earthquake Names Project which listed the names of 5,000 student victims who lost their lives because of shoddy construction of schools, his criticism of the government&apos;s use of propaganda to support the Beijing Olympics whose Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium he helped to design, and his provocative use of humor in his exhibit using photographs showing his extended middle-finger in front of Tiananmen Square. Weiwei says, &quot;There is no outdoor sport as graceful as throwing stones at a dictatorship.&quot; The film also documents the artist&apos;s exhibitions in Munich, especially a work called &quot;Remembering&quot; which displayed 9,000 backpacks spelling out the words &quot;She lived happily on this earth for 7 years,&quot; a reference to students who were killed in the Sichuan earthquake. Another exhibit shown at the Tate Gallery in London consists of 100-million porcelain hand-painted sunflower seeds made in China. Though China claims that human rights have improved in their country, Ai Weiwei&apos;s assault by police thugs attempting to prevent him from testifying at the trial of Tan Zuoren belies the claim. Zuoren, an activist and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for several articles that, according to Weiwei, were reasonable and not at all provocative.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Weiwei&apos;s activism is his use of social media, especially Twitter (@aiww), an activity that he began in earnest after his blog was taken down by the authorities. This is demonstrated by his ability to quickly organize resistance to the government&apos;s proposed demolition of his newly-built art studio in Shanghai which they deemed &quot;illegal.&quot; Though the documentary breaks no new ground as an art form and only skims the surface of Ai&apos;s personal life, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is a well-made and often inspiring film about an artist who is willing to take enormous risks for his own safety to expose human rights abuses and which reaches a new level of intensity when it is discovered that Weiwei has disappeared, leading to world-wide protests and an uncertain outcome.",

      "reviewBody": "Bad acting. Bad script. Wildly inaccurate. I am slightly surprised that Charlie Starkweather hasn&apos;t risen from the grave and hunted down the makers of this so-called film. This is the kind of worthless movie you would expect to see on late night TV, probably on one of the cable channels that specializes in bad movies. Unfortunately it&apos;s not bad in a good, goofy, campy kind of way - it&apos;s just generically bad.\n\nLet&apos;s start with the script, since that is the greatest offense. The dialogue contains phrases that no one in 1950&apos;s Nebraska, much less Charlie Starkweather and friends, would ever say. I doubt anyone today would spout out such ridiculous lines. It&apos;s the kind of stuff you might find in a Harlequin Romance from the 1970&apos;s. Where does Hollywood find such talentless writers who come up with nothing but clichÃ©d hacks? If that weren&apos;t bad enough, the script is full of inconsistencies: one minute a character will say something, the next minute he will contradict what he said before, as if he didn&apos;t remember what he just said. It&apos;s just plain dumb writing.\n\nThe acting is as bad as you would expect. I&apos;ve seen better acting in worse films, but bad acting is bad acting - no further explanation necessary.\n\nIt&apos;s so inaccurate you wonder if the writer and director read even the sketchiest accounts of the events covered. They assign Charlie&apos;s motives in killing to a shadowy character (Lance Henricksen) who talks him into murdering people for the dumbest reasons you&apos;ve ever heard. No attempt is made at historical accuracy - if you think you&apos;re going to learn something about the Starkweather-Fugate case from this film, then think again. All it will do is lead you astray. I wonder that Caril Fugate hasn&apos;t sued the makers of the film for portraying her in this manner.\n\nSo there you have it: lame all around, from the script to the final credits. Thankfully there has been a decent movie made about these events, check out &quot;Badlands&quot; with Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. It&apos;s over a decade older, but much better done, if still not very accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, if Charlie were to rise up and kill the director, script writer, and everyone involved in this movie - I doubt a jury would convict him."

      "reviewBody": "There were two primary reasons for seeing &apos;Zauber Der Boheme&apos; (&apos;Charm of La Boheme&apos;). One was my love of Puccini&apos;s opera, which &apos;Zauber Der Boheme&apos; updates. The other was Marta Eggerth, who has really grown on me recently.\n\n&apos;Zauber Der Boheme&apos; may not be a great film, but it is a good one with wonderful music and two leads on top form. It is agreed that it does a little too excessively melodramatic in places, though to be fair there was always going to be the trap of that happening, and momentum sags occasionally The film&apos;s print is not always great, with the picture quality in need of more clarity and focus which would have allowed one to appreciate the otherwise beautiful cinematography better.\n\nHowever, Eggerth is on top form, her performance is delicate, charming and moving with flashes of humour. She has an attractive presence too, while being believably frail when necessary, and sings a dream (singing music here that her voice is perfect for). Her real life husband Jan Kiepura is handsome, youthful and dashing, with the right touch of ardour and idealism. He doesn&apos;t fare too badly as an actor, if not as good as Eggerth, and while his singing does have a finesse in places it is a truly lovely sound and he sings with feeling and lively style. The two are magical together.\n\nEggerth and Kiepura are served well by a good supporting cast, with fun turns from Paul Kemp, Oscar Sima and Theo Liggins. It&apos;s all directed very capably and it&apos;s rarely dull.\n\nImperfect print aside, &apos;Zauber Der Boheme&apos; is beautifully shot and sumptuously but also atmospherically produced in costumes and sets. The music is wonderful, as to be expected, while there is a lovely mix on the most part of wicked humour and tender pathos. The story compels and draws one right in, even though the surprises factor is low, right up to the heart-wrenching ending.\n\nOverall, has a lot of charm, well performed and it delivers on the emotion. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

I knew the movie was going to be silly, but I just wanted to see some wire-fu and be entertained.\n\nThe story is silly, it&apos;s about a monk who has to protect a scroll that when read will give the reader ultimate power (of course the protector of the scroll gets the magical power of wife-fu abilities). This monk (who has no name) has to find a new protector because it&apos;s been 60 years. So he chooses a pickpocket named Kar to become the nameless monk. And then they cavort around and run into a group of neo-nazis after the scroll (those wacky neo-nazis!) a Russian mafia princess named Jade (played by the smoking hot Jaime King) and a British guy with a mohawk named Mr. Funktastic, who lives in the underground of the New York subway, and keeps making verbal threats to cut men&apos;s genitalia off.\n\nThis movie takes itself lightheartedly, so the main duo of Seann William Scott and Chow Yun-Fat act like they are cast in a buddy cop film. Both Scott and Chow are funny (especially Chow), the wire-fu is entertaining, Jaime King is hot, and the whole movie works.\n\nIt&apos;s not the best film ever, and I couldn&apos;t tell you if it&apos;s the best Chow Yun-Fat film ever, since my local Hollywood video lacks his Hong Kong imports. But Bulletproof Monk may entertain those who like cheesy martial art flicks, or appese the action junkie while he has to wait to see the next summer blockbuster. I don&apos;t like rating systems, but if I did I would give it a 6 out of 10. It&apos;s not great but good. Have fun with it."

      "reviewBody": "This is not gonna be a long and well written review, I&apos;m sorry. \n\nBut i will tell you why I loved it and why you might love it. \n\nFirst of, I love these Asian fantasy movies for many reasons. They are mostly set in a world unheard of in other places, and the story something very different than any Hollywood movie. \n\nBefore seeing the movie, I actually came across the soundtrack made by Shiro Sagisu. (Who also made the music for Casshern). And I came to the conclusion that it was the best soundtrack made by his hands. \n\nThen came the chance to see the movie. And i hadn&apos;t seen much from it before, except a couple of trailers. And with it being in Korean and with no subs i only got the standard plot. \n\nHero loves woman. Woman is in trouble. Evil man makes threats. Hero saves the day?\n\nBut after 20 minutes I was already gladly surprised of the plot. Something &quot;I&quot; had not seen before. And I&apos;m not gonna tell you what it was, since i think the surprise makes the movie even better. The movie is filled with amazing scenery and visuals that couldn&apos;t be much better. It&apos;s not over packed with fights. But the fights there do count.\n\nThere is a bit of &quot;flying/floating&quot; martial arts as in almost every classic Kung fu movie. And even though i don&apos;t care much for that, it did seam to fit the movie. \n\nWill it fall in your taste?\n\nHave you seen Casshern or Goemon? If so, and they pleased you. I don&apos;t see why you should not at least enjoy it, if not love it as i did. It has very similar elements and feeling to it. (still not as dark as Casshern).\n\nI would have given this movie a 10/10, but went with 9/10 for two reasons. 1. That given it a max will feel a bit to clichÃ© and would make people expect it to be polished with gold. 2. One of the main characters, (The damsel in distress) was kinda annoying at times and looked like she was gonna cry every second. But then again its all about the cruelty and emotion they try to express in these movies. \n\npewww!. . . \n\nSorry it got a bit longer than i had planed. Hope you forgive me for the bad grammar and enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it. Have fun.",

      "reviewBody": "I often like to read the comments from the back pages first and those here at IMDb are very, very disparaging of this film - much like the original critical reviews (and the still rather dismissive all-movie-guide blurb). The common reason is that these viewers were much offended by this movie. I can relate because I was offended as well when I saw it in 1974. And that horrified, sickened sensation stayed with me all the next day - so much so that I had to tell a co-worker about it, not in an enthusiastic way, but in an almost confessional way - as if I&apos;d done something very wrong myself in having watched it. The comments at the back, I believe, are written from that emotional viewpoint. It&apos;s visceral hatred of what they&apos;ve been unwillingly exposed to and I believe that may hinder appreciation for the actual quality of the film-making. They can&apos;t bring themselves to praise in any way something by which they feel so affronted.\n\nThis is testament to just how good this movie is. And by good, I mean effective. It&apos;s been three decades and counting since this nasty was sprung upon the viewing public, and though many far nastier (in graphic content and visuals) have avalanched down upon us since, few, if any, have been more gripping. You see, this is the type of movie that makes you ponder the &apos;nature of evil&apos;. It&apos;s this seemingly bland, irredeemable, sociopathic evil that seems to disturb the most. No mental illness explanations ala &apos;Psycho&apos; to take comfort in; no painfully, disfiguring past that has caused sadistic, homicidal madness as with &apos;The Hypnotic Eye&apos; and it&apos;s ilk; no over-the-top camp sadism as with &apos;Blood And Black Lace&apos; that can be watched and instantly dismissed, so ludicrously cinematic is the horror there.\n\nNo, at the risk of plagiarizing another commenter, the violence here feels too real. The acting is too good. The slowly unfolding scenarios too disturbingly believable. The final twenty minutes of the film are immeasurably welcomed by the viewer, as the film takes on an eerie but strangely satisfying turn. It provides much-needed catharsis, a relief from the tension and sadness of the first hour.\n\nThe ending ties up some loose ends nicely, leaving one with a kind of &apos;understanding&apos; of what it was about. A message about what inhumane attitudes can be developed in those who have been a little too privileged, perhaps. I recently became aware that the film has an alternate ending (included in the version known as &apos;The Recon Game&apos;) that serves to undermine our sense of justice when compared to the version that was shown here in Canada. Perhaps tacked on as a sop to the protestations of liberal critics, it is nowhere near as satisfying a conclusion as that of &apos;Open Season&apos;.\n\nNot that this movie is available other than as a very pricey European import (some with non-removable foreign-language subtitles yet), but the North American version of &apos;Open Season&apos; is the one to see first.",

In other words, it&apos;s a seminal work.\n\n&quot;Winchester &apos;73&quot; is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you&apos;ve seen them copied so many times in later movies, and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you. The dialogue, the pacing and Mann&apos;s direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you&apos;re a fan this is a &quot;must-see,&quot; but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it lent additional realism to the film. \n\nThis is a remarkably underrated film, and well worth keeping an eye out for. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart which provides some background on the film.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Malzenstwo z rozsadku&apos; (The Marriage of Convenience) was one of early comedies by Polish acknowledged director Stanislaw Bareja, better known for his later classic satires for communist reality in Poland. This early film contains elements of a social satire as well. The main plot is a feeling growing between a poor aspiring painter Andrzej (Daniel Olbrychski) and Joanna (Elzbieta Czyzewska), who pretends to be a rich diplomat&apos;s daughter. In fact, Joanna&apos;s parents come from a lower social class and own a stall with clothes at the market. Such businessmen were hardly tolerated by communist authorities, so they try to hide their great income, and they like an idea of their daughter marrying the painter, who might sell paintings at high prices to dummy buyers, thus legalizing the income. The problem is, that neither Andrzej nor Joanna are aware of their planned role. Their love however wins.\n\nThe film is pleasant to watch, light comedy, with colourful views of Warsaw old town from 1960s. In spite of poor actorship and noticeable lack of talent of young Daniel Olbrychski, Elzbieta Czyzewska is charming, and lots of supporting actors steal show in their parts. Especially likeable is a character of Edzio (Bohdan Lazuka), as a jaded pauperised descendant of artistocracy, looking for a rich wife and faking French accent in conversations with his artistocratic aunt. Great performance is also given by Bogumil Kobiela as Eng. Kwilecki, stealing twine from a factory across the street, what is an allusion to limited supply of goods in communist economy. Boleslaw Plotnicki playing Joanna&apos;s father is convincing as simple, but clever businessman.",

      "reviewBody": "By the time her fifth film was ready to be launched Margaret Sullavan had achieved a position of some clout with her original studio Universal Pictures. She used that clout to get as her leading man, a young player she knew from Broadway as the best friend of her then husband Henry Fonda. Sullavan got Carl Laemmle to get Louis B. Mayer to loan him James Stewart and from Paramount as the second lead she got Ray Milland.\n\nBut Stewart was her project and she more than director Edward Griffith got him through Next Time We Love to favorable notices. This was Stewart&apos;s highest billing yet, co-starring to Margaret Sullavan and he made the most of it. They did three more films together and in only one of them did either Sullavan or Stewart not die in. They were the king and queen of bittersweet romances back in the day.\n\nSullavan is highly successful stage star and Stewart is a reporter with ambitions to be an international correspondent. Sullavan might have been better off marrying Ray Milland who is a producer, but something about the shy and stammering Jimmy wins her heart and that would be the first in a long line of female hearts on the screen to feel that way.\n\nOf course being an international correspondent does keep Stewart away a lot and Margaret does not want to give up a successful stage career that&apos;s just getting started. Even with the arrival of a baby boy the problems only increase until a really heavy crisis comes on that overwhelms all.\n\nNext Time We Love is an intelligent mature drama that holds up well and I&apos;m surprised has not been remade. I could see a Cate Blanchett or a Gwyneth Paltrow in Sullavan&apos;s role with possibly Matthew McConaughey in the Stewart part in a remake today. Somebody in Hollywood take note.",

      "reviewBody": "Granted, I hadn&apos;t even heard of this 2010 Thai horror movie titled &quot;The Intruder&quot; (aka &quot;Khew ar-khard&quot;). But the fact that I was given a chance to watch it and that it was an Asian horror movie was more than sufficient to make me want to sit down and spend time on it.\n\nFirst of all, the title is rather poorly selected. Sure, the cobras were intruding in the building, but I mean, come on, it just was such a poor choice of title. Because &quot;The Intruder&quot; would hint at someone entering where not allowed, or maybe even a supernatural entity making such intrusion.\n\nBut moving on. In terms of entertainment value, then &quot;The Intruder&quot; wasn&apos;t actually that bad. It turned out to be surprisingly good actually. Sure, it was generic and might as well have been titled &quot;Snakes in a Building&quot;, but the movie was campy enough to actually be entertaining.\n\nNow, the CGI animated snakes, while having good enough textures and looked real enough, just suffered from some poorly animation transition from computer to movie. They were surrounded by a black outlining halo and moved awkwardly. That was a shame, because the snakes were such an important focal point of the movie.\n\nThe acting in the movie was good. And I was enjoying the fact that none of the actors or actresses were familiar to me, as I tend to like watching new talents on the screen and not associate them with previously portrayed characters.\n\nFor a horror movie then &quot;The Intruder&quot; wasn&apos;t particularly impressive, but hey, it is what it is. I am rating this 2010 movie from director Thanadol Nualsuth a six out of ten stars. I was adequately entertained, although I doubt that I will ever be returning to watch it a second time.",

He always played a mischievous Irishman; how creative.\n\nFonda is always good; regardless of his vehicles in film and Sullivan is believable (but not as a Brit).\n\nThe production crew made a few mistakes; like the desert being sweaty at night; it is cool in the desert at night, and unbearingly hot in the day.\n\nThis leads to a few other holes in the plot. After the crew attacks and kills a German crew, why didn&apos;t they take THEIR food and water? Duh.\n\nSecond error. Why not kill the Germans while they are sleeping instead of foraging for food and water? They would have been a lot easier to kill sleeping, rather than awake and walking around with their weapons. Sorry, no sale. Had very little to do with real desert warfare.",

This has no relation to the others and none of the spooky storytelling or talent by the looks of it either. I did enjoy the first and third movies a fair bit but this is an utterly generic high school haunting movie that just copies J-horror mindlessly. It begins with a suicide pledge before moving into random scenes of girls being haunted by a bloody classmate. The whole thing is so senseless I didn&apos;t have a clue what was going on, and it didn&apos;t help that the subtitles mistranslated characters as Soy and Eugene (!). In the end, I was utterly bored.",

But they get to escape thanks to the ventriloquist skills of Hill . Later on , while the hustlers travel by airplane are confused for two international spies , and someone give them a luggage full of million of dollars . After that, the pair become involved in several adventures , and rare situations full of risks , dangers and fun.\n\nThe big time duo from Spahetti Western wrapped in humor as Â¨They call me Trinity Â¨ and its followings as Â¨Trinity is still my nameÂ¨ and Â¨Trouble makersÂ¨ were run out and then they&apos;re transfered to Police and action genre . As they played the Miami series which are set in Florida , such as Â¨Miami SupercopsÂ¨, Â¨Crime BustersÂ¨, and Â¨SuperfuzzÂ¨ . Here Terence Hill and Bud Spencer play characters mistaken for spies in this spy spoof . Similarly, in their next movie , Miami Supercops (1985), the two play secret agents who go undercover as policemen . There are plenty of humor based on diverse personality and physical differences among them . This one packs silly comedy with James Bond influence , tongue-in-cheek , slapstick and ordinary struggles , neither blood , nor violence ; besides , including some car pursuits. It appears usual secondaries who customarily intervene on their films , as David Huddleston and Ricardo Pizutti . Average cinematography and lousy musical score composed by means of synthesizer , being composed by the usual La Bionda . The motion picture was regularly directed by Enzo Barboni who previously was a notorious cameraman as proved in Â¨DjangoÂ¨, Â¨HellbendersÂ¨ , and Â¨Goodbye TexasÂ¨ and made the classics : Â¨TrinityÂ¨ and Â¨Trinity is still my nameÂ¨. The tale will appeal to Hill and Spencer fans.",

Banderas portrayed innocence and simplicity of character in these early movies that Hollywood always seems to make large and gloss over any sort of character development. There is something that Hollywood seems to drain away and leave behind in the character of people, yet Banderas/Almovodar capture so perfectly the average man/woman and portray them in interesting ways. Atame (Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down) is a delicious little movie about a crook who falls in love with an actress.  To get her attention, he kidnaps her and the fun begins. Almovodar&apos;s movies are always filled with quirky characters, funny dialogue and plot twists.  To see Antonio Banderas at his finest playing a simple man who falls in love but has some issues..Atame is a cute, touching movie to rent."

He tries to convince his parent and teacher what really happened to his assignment but nobody believes him. A few months after, there is a big blockbuster hit coming out tilted &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; that&apos;s supposedly been written and produced by Marty Wolf. Jason notices that the movie is based on his english paper and that Marty Wolf has stolen his story. Now along with his cute friend Kaylee(Amanda Bynes) Jason will travel to Los Angeles and try to convince everybody what a big fat liar Marty Wolf is. I thought this was a harmless fun little movie. It&apos;s nothing special but it has a couple of jokes and it&apos;s pretty entertaining. It&apos;s more for the younger audience but I still found it to be somewhat enjoyable. I would give Big Fat Liar 6/10",

Needless to say, there is no nudity. It&apos;s all done with innuendo and the extraordinary degree of energy and physical magnetism that Lubitsch manages to elicit from all his actors. For once in a film, you actually feel that these extremely attractive young people can hardly wait to go to bed with each other, and when they do (off-screen of course) the result is Â transformative. When they burst out in song, as they do on the slightest provocation in a Lubitsch musical, it is because they are full of emotions they can no longer contain. There&apos;s nothing dirty or smutty whatsoever in the Lubitsch Touch, as there is sometimes in the work of his disciple Billy Wilder. Lubitsch&apos;s characters explode with life, the joy of being young and in love. There are many great film directors, but not one has ever been able to create the kind of sexual energy that Lubitsch puts into all his films. Silly as the plots may be, mediocre as most of the songs are, his films bristle with the romance and humor of life.",

Very little of the movie feels scripted. The relationship between John and Anita simply develops as relationships generally develop.\n\nThese things are what make this an especially good movie. Even if you can&apos;t fully relate to the characters, you still feel that they&apos;re realistic characters. I should note that because it&apos;s a Scandinavian movie, much of it deliberately moves slowly. There&apos;s no attention-getting action, but there is a shot of a Beatles poster.\n\nFine movie. I recommend it.",
