The arm holes leave plenty of room for arm movement and since I’m a bit short waisted, the length in front is perfect as well.  Sturdy fabric that looks like it will last forever.  Great product!",

Of course, I haven’t logged as many miles in them yet, but they’re just as lightweight and breathable as my trusty pair.\r\n\r\nI love the modern look of these boots in the Trooper color, and I can’t stress enough how much I appreciate a wide fit for hiking. Vasque is my go-to for a reason—they last and keep my feet happy! I’m really pleased with this style.",

Go back to a 60 inch lace!!\r\nThe toe box is also lower than the breeze III-the top of my toes hit the top of the toe box, especially going down hill.

I was excited when I found the Vasquez woman&apos;s breeze. Loved the color, and they were the perfect width of I went up a size. Although the VERY flat soles made my feet hurt, I was mostly satisfied my first day wearing them. Unfortunately they aren&apos;t waterproof whatsoever. Every day I get home, take my boots off and find my socks wet. No, it&apos;s not sweat.... It&apos;s where the mesh parts are on the top of the shoe. Pan to today. I worked 2 days ago. Here I am getting ready for work, go to put my boots on, and they are STILL WET INSIDE! THATS 48 HOURS! It&apos;s summer, it&apos;s not humid, they should be bone dry even if they were wet. \r\nI&apos;m super disappointed in these boots. The only thing I&apos;m actually happy with is how light weight they are. Unfortunately, I&apos;m stuck with them because I can&apos;t afford a new pair of boots.",

        "reviewBody": "THIS IS NOT THE SAME BOOT. I was so excited to see the return of the Breeze that I immediately purchased. My first pair of hiking boots was the Breeze II in a 7.5, and when I got a little older I purchased the Breeze III in an 8W. I loved that it had a rigid sole, plenty of space for my square-shaped toe area, and that it had unparalleled ankle support that kept my heel in place and prevented my toes from harm. My foot has gotten a little bigger and I went to purchase this new Breeze model in a 8.5W and am so disappointed. Everything I loved about the Breeze III is gone! Gone is the dual-density midsole which gives the feeling over a thicker sole with a higher torsional rigidity - the new Breeze model has a MUCH higher forefoot flex which I think is fine for a trail runner but cannot stand in a hiking boot. The new Breeze model has a much larger reinforced toe cap that extends to the metatarsals and decreases the total area of that breathable fabric at the top of the toe and at the sides of the boot - this higher profile means that there is much less flexibility at the top of the toe area, a problem for people with a more square foot or upturned toes that enjoyed not hitting a reinforced toe box every step. And the part that upsets me most: The ankle support is just gone. My favorite part of the Breeze III is that I can hike downhill all day and the rigid ankle support locks my heel in place and saves my toes the abuse. I think this is an all around fit change, but they did also change the midfoot locking hooks from a double shank to a single. You see all of these reviews from people who have had their Breezes &quot;for years&quot; and say it is such a great boot - THIS IS NOT THE SAME BOOT. Vasque, I beg of you, bring back the Breeze III!",

They are just a bit narrow though, so I wanted to try this new version in wide for a multi day hike, since my feet will most likely swell and need the extra toe space. Trying them on in my house the sole felt lumpy and uncomfortable. I honestly thought it was a manufacturing error, it was that bad. Sad to return these and even have to pay the return shipping even though it seems like I got a messed up shoe.",

Like those jeans, there is no flash or pomp, which wears out easily and will look dated well before the stitching fails. The Coastal&apos;s perfection is that of the bonsai, complete with balance and proportion. In fit and comfort it knows no equal (and i have a lot of hoodies). Aesthetically, i would have to call it versatile or even sublime. My other sweatshirts might call it a ball-hog.   Whether hiking the rhododendron filled gullies of New River Gorge near my house or at work as an arborist (where everything else seems to get torn) the blue and grey both seem to complete every outfit so i can focus on performance.  Seriously, my only complaint is that i havent been able to get all of the other perfectly matched color combos.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought one of these Nite Ize LED balls a long, long time ago. Like, when they first made their debut on display at the store I had to have one. I could tell right away that these balls were in a category unto themselves. I was right too. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if someone told me that my Nite Ize LED glow ball has been with me for twenty years. I honestly do not remember when I got it, but it has been in my life a very long time. It has survived five dogs over the years. Sadly, earlier this month it died beyond my ability to resuscitate it anymore. \r\n\r\nInitially, I couldn&apos;t find the Nite Ize GlowStreak at any of my local stores, nor find it on Amazon. I thought they had been discontinued and I was very sad about it. Reluctantly I tried the Nerf LED balls. I went through three in less than three weeks. They are disgraceful and do not even begin to match the quality of the Nite Ize GlowStreak. \r\n\r\nIt never crossed my mind to come directly to the Nite Ize website until a friend suggested it. I am so very happy to find that Nite Ize is still making and selling the GlowStreak LED balls, as well as discovering there is a new model to try as well. (Please never end these product lines!) \r\n\r\nThank you Team Nite Ize! You have done a most excellent job. The quality, value, and durability of the GlowStreak LED balls, and all your other products I have bought, is truly appreciated. You have made me a very satisfied customer who will be with you for life. I have A LOT of your products and they all are appreciated just as much.",

        "reviewBody": "I have tried every light-up ball. Seriously. Most only stay lit for about 30 seconds after the ball is still. This doesn&apos;t help me find my forgetful dog&apos;s ball in the tall grass at the dog park in the dark. This stays lit. For a long time. Long enough to ask your dog 10 times where the ball is, then tromp through the grass to find it. And you will find it, because it is bright. Not blinding, but really lit up. The battery inside is secure. Really secure. And you can replace the battery. Most light up balls are &quot;once the battery goes out you throw the ball away&quot;. And this ball bounces. There are some rechargeable balls out there. But it&apos;s like throwing a rock because those rechargeable balls are so heavy they don&apos;t bounce. My dog wants the ball to bounce. And they float. And it&apos;s a good size, my small dog likes it and so do bigger dogs, it&apos;s &quot;medium&quot; sized. \r\nSo 1) It stays lit and the light is bright 2) It actually bounces 3) It floats 4) You can replace the battery 4) The battery inside is secure. 5) It&apos;s small enough for small dogs and big enough for big dogs. This is the ONLY light up ball that does those 5 things. And it comes in &quot;disco&quot; - it cycles through all the colors which is awesome. Literally every dog in the park wants this ball. My dog carries it around so proudly it is hilarious. This ball is the best out there.",

I find this draws &amp; keeps my dogs attention even more so then a standard bounce ball. She is literally a nutcase when she realizes I have it on hand. The batteries are easy to replace, and last a really long time. Most Importantly, this ball is suitable for a dog that suffers with seizure activity, the colour changing features is a “Fade” between colours not rapid blinking sequences. The only time the ball gives off the “blinking” frequency is to let you know it’s going to shut off if it senses no activity",

This Rope Caddy II is just about the perfect gym/easy approach crag rope bag.  \n\nIts method of closure is simple, yet different and faster than anyone else. Ensure the rope is on the tarp - pick up the tarp at all four corners, give it a good shake and close everything up. Super fast, simple, and intuitive.\n\nKeep in mind that this isn&apos;t the best bag for ALL situations, though. If I need to carry my rope for much of a distance on the approach, or if I want to carry a bunch of other gear in the bag (for something like a quick sport climbing session), I prefer the DMM rope bag with it&apos;s larger size and far superior compression and shoulder straps.\n\nBut, when I want a convenient, well built, and super fast/easy to use gym/crag rope bag I reach for this.

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve picked up a new pair for the past few years to keep my gear fresh. Love these! I got my size dialled in perfect with Garneau gear which is a huge reason for returning even for my shorts. Fit is sweet, love the drawstring waist (all cycling lycra should have this), and the chamois fits in just the right place in the saddle. Newer versions seem thicker than my old (favorite) pair from past seasons.  I&apos;ve worn them into the 20&apos;s and stayed toasty even though I&apos;m not very aero with a puffy keeping my core warm??. If need be, I toss a pair of soccer shorts or windpants over them for extra protection, or to run to the store.  The chamois eliminates need for messing around layering over my summer shorts which feels wicked bulky to me. They are comfortable enough that I would probably wear them to lounge around the house if I didn&apos;t think it a little wierd.\nThese will continue to be my winter cycling tights until I find a warmer pair that doesn&apos;t destroy my meager budget!",

        "reviewBody": "Purchased this bike after having rented a Swithcblade SLX build in Bend last summer. Love the bike overall but the SRAM brakes are by far the weakest link. While they have great stopping power, the modulation is not as refined as Shimano and they squeak like the proverbial greased pig. Still trying to get the suspension dialed into my liking. Seems a bit stiffer than I remember from the rental so going to try removing volume spacers which should do the trick. Love the GLX Transmission. Shifting is crisp and even better under load. Just takes a bit to get used to the controls.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this for all-day adventure runs where my 14L could hold all the stuff, but not hold it properly. This is a great pack for distributing weight evenly, providing quick access to snacks from the front pockets, and holding all kinds of stuff. I really love the pole pockets. My only complaint: it&apos;s big. I bought the Women&apos;s Small (I don&apos;t think an XS is available), and even fully loaded, I have to fully cinch it. It does bounce a bit when I run downhills, chaffing my sides. Unfortunately, the chest straps are stretchy, which adds to the problem of getting a tight fit. Other issues that may influence your decision: there isn&apos;t a place on the shoulder straps for an inReach or GPS device (most ultra running packs have a mesh pocket for that). And there aren&apos;t any small pockets to stuff things like your ID - it&apos;s just one big bucket in there. That doesn&apos;t bother me, but I know some of my friends struggled with organizing. Overall I like the pack - I just wish it came in a smaller size. For size reference, I&apos;m 5&apos;5&quot;, 32-D chest and longish torso.",

        "reviewBody": "I really wanted to like this pack - bought it primarily for multipitch climbing. But it hasn’t quite held up to the job. After just a month of use (probably 10 days out) there are small tears developing in the bottom of the bag (on the durable ripstop fabric!). And the shoulder straps aren’t adjustable so it’s hard to crank it down tight, especially since it doesn’t have the waist belt. It carries well with a light load, but at max capacity I wish for more strap adjustability than it has. \n\nThat said, it might be the right bag for your application! The stretch outside pocket is surprisingly durable, I love the running vest chest pockets, and you can get a lot in it (maybe too much in it). But it isn’t very durable.",

I have a shell for warmer days but had to bundle too many layers to stay warm on those cold days. I run very hot while skiing, I get to the bottom and need to strip or open all my layers to not overheat. This jacket gives you breathability while carrying the insulation that keeps you warm on the chair up. \n\nLiterally the only thing that could be improved is the size of the armpit ventilation. Like I mentioned above I run hot so I would have enjoyed more airflow when I open the vents. But that tiny detail is the only thing I can find at fault and it&apos;s more of a personal preference.

The big challenge with those pants was the fabric was subject to getting holes, which I had hoped was remedied by this new version. Perhaps that problem has been dealt with, but the fit here is just not flattering. Going back. Would happily try again if you bring back a &quot;classic&quot; fit from three years ago and durable fabric!",

The crotch area looks weird, frumpy, and the pants don&apos;t look as sleek and overall are just not comfortable compared to the original. The material is also not 100% wool, not as nice/quality of material as the previous version. I had to return even though I loved the purple color. I really hope the IB team rethinks this and goes back to the classic original design. I&apos;m glad I stocked up on the previous version because this one is just not as good.",

Flattering on my very wide, high waist figure. Not too see through! I just really wish they had more colors, especially earth or jewel tones. They rarely seem to have any colors that look good for an &quot;autumn&quot; person. Also I want to note that I also bought a W**lly competing pant and they had holes immediately.

Because this is a ski jacket, NF has a standard snow gusset elastic piece that is meant to keep the snow from blowing upwards into the person when skiing. The elastic on this jacket is either too tight, or it&apos;s an indication that I&apos;m too fat to fit it. If the gusset elastic wasn&apos;t there, this jacket would have fitted perfectly. I pondered on cutting it off to keep the jacket but decided against it. The gusset also caused a bump, where the fabric gathered on one hip only, not both. I think that&apos;s a sewing quality issue.

I bought a marmot bag years ago and it was my absolute favorite. Super lightweight and compact,  it keeps me warm but never overheated and there was never any issues with the zippers. I ended up loosing that bag and not buying a new one for a couple years. I finally decided to get a new bag and figured marmot would be the best place to look. It turns out not only did they still make the same bag it&apos;s not made out of more eco-friendly materials! I ordered the bag and got it very quickly in the mail and am very pleased with my purchase. I can&apos;t wait to be able to go out with my own sleeping bag again!",

I was plenty warm even had to unzip the sleeping bag at times. I look forward to using the sleeping bag on my trip to Torres Del Paine in December this year. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this bag comes in either a left or right zip. Some websites only carry one zipper configuration. My first bag was a right zip bag. As a right handed person, this was awkward for me.",

Thank goodness they still make them. They are kinda difficult to get on (as several reviews have noted) as they have a deep heel cup. I use a long shoe horn and that works very well, so getting them on is no big deal. I do not run trails, but I do walk a lot for exercise and these shoes are great as casual shoes, for the gym, walking in the park, and so on. I have difficult -to-fit feet and need a wide toe-box but also can&apos;t have the lace holes too far down toward my big toes as they (my big toes) have big spurs on them. And that ability of these shoes to not antagonize my spurs is worth its weight in gold. I still highly recommend these for a variety of venues.",

They don&apos;t have the pull tab at the heal (that so many other shoes have) to help, so you have to jab your thumbs in help get them on your feet. Even with that, it isn&apos;t fun. In the winter, getting these shoes on is at the TOP of my list of most dreaded chores (not to be dramatic), but cold fingers + having to work this hard to get them hard is terrible. If it wasn&apos;t for this, I&apos;d give 5 stars for sure.",

I&apos;ve gone through most of the popular brands a couple of times now and figured I&apos;d give the wildcats one more shot. My problem with them the first time I tried them was that I should have gone up a full half size instead of the weird 1/4 size... So I normally wear a 10.5 and bumped up to an 11 (44.5) and they fit fantastic. \nRoomy toe area, SOLID heel lock and excellent cushioning. They give my feet some room to swell and are still comfy... Do I wish they were a little lower drop? Yep, but that has bothered me less than I thought it would... My knees and lower back actually feel really good after wearing these! \nSo give them a shot and don&apos;t be scared to order at least a 1/2 size up, maybe a full size...",

I will say they run small, I ended up having to get 11.5 and I don&apos;t wear that size in any other shoe, so keep that in mind. \n\n(edit)\n\nAfter walking around the neighborhood in these a bit, I did a 35 mile trip through snow (UGH) and these felt great! No break-in period really, felt comfortable instantly. They did feel a bit too cushion-y at first, but I&apos;ve gotten used to that. They are SO grippy! So grippy that they feel almost sticky when I&apos;m wearing them, which is awesome. \n\n(edit again)\n\nThe only thing I HATE about these shoes is they don&apos;t have the pull tab thing on the back of the heel. Putting these on dry is fine, but when you have to put them on wet with wet socks (frequently since it rains here a lot), it&apos;s a PAIN.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve owned and used many many sleeping bags. I still own many bags, probably too many. Some are super light and compressible, some are super warm and protective in the gnarliest conditions. After using this bag on a couple of trips, I can already see that it may soon become the only bag I need, and may ever need. It hits such a sweet spot in so many ways. It’s amazingly light and compressible for how warm it is. The 15F temp rating seems too low. I feel like it’s warmer than other 15F bags I’ve used in the past [including an older phantom 15]. and impressively, the fit also seems roomier than other bags i’ve used in this temp/weight class. The lining fabric is super buttery soft and the black color not only feels warmer [i assume because it absorbs more heat? maybe this is just perception], but it also seems to dry out much quicker when flipped inside out in the morning. I’m not sure what i’ll do with my other sleeping bags, but at this point the only bag I need [and want] to be using is this one.",

I&apos;ve worn this sock when the temps are between 35 and 50 which we see a lot in spring and fall. They are not much thicker than my summer socks but are very toasty. The fabric has held up great over several seasons now. I&apos;m ordering another pair now... :-)",

Perfect to layer up with during cold days or wear on its own during the warmer fall months. Will get many seasons of use.",

        "reviewBody": "I love the design and layout of this bag. I also have the 100 L version. However, after one trip, there is a giant tear along some of the stitching. Backcountry is out of stock, so I can&apos;t exchange it. Steep and Cheap has the same one in the same color. However, I have to return this item. In the meantime, I purchased the same item from Steep and Cheap AND paid for shipping, making the exchange more expensive than the original item because I bought the original item at the Backcountry Retail store and didn&apos;t have to pay shipping. \n\nNot the greatest service, especially considering Steep and Cheap and Backcountry are the same company, even though they don&apos;t like to advertise this information.\n\nI&apos;m disappointed in Dakine&apos;s quality control and the Backcountry&apos;s customer service.  \n\nBackcountry&apos;s retail store model isn&apos;t helping the situation. Anyone who has been there knows what a pain it is to shop and then have to deal with this for an exchange, which makes the experience that much more frustrating. I&apos;m getting tired of dealing with Backcountry, as this is becoming a common issue. \n\nBackcountry&apos;s model is more concerned with their own efficiency than customer service. They don&apos;t appear to care about the customer&apos;s valuable time. \n\nI&apos;ll consider shopping elsewhere from now on, especially since returns are difficult and common with Backcountry.",

My only complaint is the one pocket. With the center zipper, I don’t know why they didn’t add a pocket on each side at least. Especially with the lack of longer sleeves with thumb-holes, it would be nice to be able to put your hands in pockets or at least more than a phone. Otherwise, the fit is flattering and the waffle material is nice. However, it seems to be designed for fashion and not as much function which is a disappointing turn in many outdoor clothing items these days. \n\nRegarding size, I initially tried a small, but the sleeves were very short.",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this in black for an extended trip to Greenland. For sizing reference I purchased an XL to accommodate 44in hips but fit a L everywhere else (with sweater underneath). It did well in the winter and I appreciated that it wasn’t bulky like most parkas. There are plenty of lined pockets which was convenient. The lined hood felt restricting when it wasn’t in use but I appreciated its close fitting structure once I used it. I had a liner jacket ready, thinking it might be necessary but nope! This parka does it all and stay dry and warm no matter the activity. Mine was used primarily in snow while hiking/walking and extended time outdoors in rough arctic winters. No better test than that! If fashion matters to you, it was as streamlined as an arctic parka can get. There is a toggle to make the waist cinch if that’s your thing. All in all a great parka I’d highly recommend.",

I love every details of this jacket honestly - GoreTex canvas shell, polar fleece lined hood and pockets, lots of pockets etc... But I am sorry this jacket just isn&apos;t warm enough for you to go anywhere below -15. It&apos;s thin and not as puff as you think a 700+ down jacket should be. Very disappointed!",

As I get colder than most, I have to add an additional down sweater layer inside, for which this jacket is designed, but otherwise it&apos;s perfect. I walked the wet redwoods, and on many beaches, and it did exactly the job I wanted. It can be bulky for some; I would not take this on adventure travel as it&apos;s way too big and bulky. But for local use with the rain and wind, terrific. Plan for it to be roomy for layers. Love the many pockets.",

I generally run cold so I wanted to make sure I had something warm and versatile enough for the various tours and time I would spend outside. This parka nailed everything I was looking for! Amazing windproof tech. Plenty of pockets and large enough to fit what I needed (no need for a purse as I was roaming around town). Large inside pockets for my mittens or gloves. Love the inside breast pocket for my phone, I realized keeping my phone there was perfect so it would stay warm with my body heat. This parka seriously made my trip so much more enjoyable knowing I was warm enough for anything thrown at me. Paired with OR merino wool base layers was a huge plus.",

Roomy but somehow still compact and comfortable to carry. The laptop sleeve fits both my 13 inch work laptop and portable second screen, and I can fit all my cords, mouse, and headphones in one exterior pocket. I can fit an extra layer, notebooks, and even office flats in the main compartment and I love that this has a suitcase handle sleeve on the exterior for travel. On top of that, it us durable and comfortable to carry. I love this bag and will use it for a long time.",

I even wear it while I am using a baby carrier. I have used it for traveling twice with two little kids and it is absolutely perfect because you can see everything and it all stays organized. Love the double water bottle pockets and the outer zip pockets. And even when it is stuffed full, it is really comfortable to carry. Can&apos;t say enough good things about this bag.",

But I have a few Pros and Cons: Pros: - Decent in terms of space provided - Water bottle holders on both sides - Two quick-access medium-size pockets in the back; One large pocket in bag - Hooks sewn-in inserts along the upper rim of the bag Cons: - Space is not big enough to just hold all your clothes if you just throw your stuff in, so must fold your clothes before placing in bag. - The shoulder strap attachment is REALLY bad and sometimes can just pop-off. I get the design North Face tried to implement but it feels cheaply made and constantly unravels",

I put them on and quickly realized the sawing seam of the left shoe between the rubber and the soft part just above my heel was not sawed smoothly. I took them off and touched the area with my fingers.  You would feel and tell right away that It is clearly sawed/assembled wrong.  The right side is nice and smooth but the left side has a significant bump which rubs my heal so badly. To my disappointment, I have to return these. My size is gone and no longer available either. :(",

I bought the green camo, when it is actually blue-ish (see attached). I like better the actual color on Stage, but had to return A1 for the color reason. TLD needs to fix their photos.",

At the widest part of the shoulder (tip to tip) = 15.5&apos;, the narrowest part of the waist = 11&quot;, and the bottom band at the widest = 14&quot;.  You can double these if you want circumference.  Tiny, right?!  As far as the fabric and quality, all seems well.  I&apos;ll report back.",

The staff at Waterstonia thought this was the best fit and even tho it was s little stiff I took a chance and it’s been awesome. I climb mostly in the gym but tested a couple times outside with a rack and it was very comfy cozy!!!! It has broken in really nicely. Falls are not at all uncomfortable! Hooray!",

The merino wool is incredibly soft, breathable, and keeps me warm without overheating. What I love most is its versatility-I can use it as a neck gaiter, headband, or even a beanie. It&apos;s lightweight and packs down easily, making it the perfect companion for any trip. The only slight drawback is that it can stretch out a bit after heavy use, but it always bounces back after a wash. Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking functional, durable gear!",

It keeps my head cool under the sun, and perfect under my altus poncho to keep the rain off my face and getting the rain drip inside my poncho. It also dries quickly. We got lots of compliments along the way. This has traveled with me many times back and forth between US and Europe. It would look so beat up every time I take it off my luggage  but I would just leave it outside and it would reshape back perfectly. No lines nor creases. I bought a second pair to put my travel/backpacking patches on it.",

This is hands down the coolest hat ever, and I love that there is enough room to sit on top of the head and not smush my curls down. The adjustable chin and head straps are great as well. I bought this for my partner, but I find myself stealing it all the time for myself ;)",

Look better aesthetically than PI. Pad is good, little side pocket is handy. With 20% off coupon, the price/quality ratio is hard to match. Will definitely buy again.",

The waist is too tight and the bottom of the shorts are loose on my legs. I am 5&apos;8&quot; and weigh 159lbs. The chamois isn&apos;t that great either. I would definitely not recommend these shorts.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;d say these fit true to size, but that assumes you are used to Castelli.  I&apos;ve had a pair of the Endurance 2 for a while and they&apos;ve been great so I got a pair of these.  The fit is similar, they feel a little tighter, but I&apos;m guessing that my old ones are stretched.  The waistband is the only noticeable difference, it&apos;s wider and flatter than the 2.  Like the last version, they run small, but don&apos;t fit as tightly as the race cut like the Competizione (which don&apos;t fit me).  I&apos;m a short stocky guy (I wear small shorts but medium jerseys for my chest and shoulders), but they work for me.  \nAs far as fit: they are tight, they&apos;re compression shorts, and you are NOT going to simply step into them and pull them up.  I honestly have to put them on in stages and get the cuffs set around my thighs before I get them all the way on.  And you&apos;ll have to &quot;position&quot; pretty deliberately.  Once on, I find them very comfortable although the chamois sometimes takes a few minutes of riding to settle in since it can move a little in its &apos;pouch&apos;.\nSo I definitely recommend them, just understand what you are getting.",

XL should be mortals XL, I am not even sure is a XXXL (biggest size available) fits me, although my Pant/Jeans Waist is only 34&quot;.\n\nWhilst the sizing / reviews mention that it fits small, the sizing info states that an XL is a 34&quot; waist, so it&apos;s beyond wrong and misleading ... very disappointing.\n\nShort quality is great which is expected from Castelli, sizing on the site is a disaster.\n\nvery unhappy and I cannot return it as i am not in US for now.",

The key to the Selle SMP saddles is to run it with a -1 to -3 degree nose down. Holds you in the pocket but you can still slide up to the nose when you need that power. I’d purchase again. Highly recommend. Find the one that fits your sit bones and enjoy the ride.",

It&apos;s easy to get the perfect amount of stability and also easy to get the shoes off and on quickly.

Being that it was the only size available, I underestimated what an 84&quot; lace would actually look like on a boot. 84&quot; IS A LOT OF LACE! I don&apos;t even know what kind of boot or shoe you would need an 84&quot; lace for. Maybe these were meant for a corset? Maybe these double as paracord and aren&apos;t for your shoes at all. You&apos;re supposed to string up a tarp with these and cowboy camp. In a pinch you could use them as a leash and walk your dog, but be carful on trails that have leash length restrictions, these might be too long.",

Unfortunately, when I hold it up to my current lesser quality seatpost (which has zero offset), I can see this seatpost isn&apos;t going to work. The saddle support rails go too far back, and I would run out of saddle rail if I were to install it. I have a Selle SMP saddle which needs to be placed 10-15mm more forward than other saddles, and I can see now it will only work with a zero setback post and probably not every one of those. Just something to keep in mind in case you run a Selle SMP saddle. Hopefully Ritchey makes a zero offset post that&apos;s as nice as this one.",

However, when he tried it on, the sleeves were slightly too long and his &quot;tummy&quot; poked out of the bottom of the waist line. When I called Dickies to see if ordering a &quot;long&quot;-sized jacket would correct the problem, they told me the longer size would also make the sleeves longer. Sadly, I had to return the jacket for a refund. I would have gladly ordered the longer size if the sleeves weren&apos;t going to be an issue. I would only recommend this product to someone who doesn&apos;t have &quot;tummy&quot; issues, or someone with really long arms.",

There was no option for tall in his size, but we both have had good experiences purchasing Dickies apparel and decided to take a chance. Turns out, it was too short. Which is unfortunate because the price was great, the jacket was well made, and it arrived in a timely manner. My only complaint, when it didn&apos;t fit I had to pay to have it sent back. That was a bit costly, and will factor in the next time we order online.",

I’m 6’4” 155lbs and got a medium. Fits really good other than the length, which again…6’ 4” so… that’s pretty typical. The inside kangaroo pocket zipper pocket is cool. I’ve litterally lost things inside it because it’s so thick that I can’t feel it without actually opening zipper. Would definitely recommend if you live somewhere with actual winter. If you’re in like Florida… might be a little warm for “winter” there.",

The finger holsters inside the mitt provide very decent dexterity and the down keeps my hands warm even in single digit temps. These are the first gloves that have kept my hand warm.  I have Leki trigger poles and appreciate the integration of the mitts but I use them with all my poles- not just those with triggers.",
