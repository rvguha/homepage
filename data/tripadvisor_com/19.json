We'll go inside two haunted locations - of which one of them is part of the famous Seattle Underground! We will go to more than 10 locations in Pioneer Square, Downtown Seattle and the Pike Public Market area. \n\nGuests will hear over 10 stories of murder, mayhem, betrayal, disease and corruption - a story at each location. These stories are the reason for the restless spirits of Seattle. \n\nWe will also explain how the ghosts can be experienced by guests at each location. We'll finish the tour at Kells Irish Pub, with yet another ghost story there as well. If there are under-age guests on the tour, we'll tell the story outside the pub, and if all guests are over 21, we'll tell the last story inside.",

We will teach guests the about rich history of the beautiful Pioneer Square, but we also want to show guests off-the-beaten-path places in the neighborhood. \n\nIt will be a leisurely walk through the streets of the neighborhood for an hour, with about 15 stops (one to two blocks apart, between the stops), and we’ll have short (approximately 5-minute long), interactive and fascinating stories at each stop. I will encourage questions and comments from my participants, to make the tour interactive. This tour will be approximately two thirds of a mile walk (with may stops and stories in between).",

Currently, the zoo is undergoing some expansion/renovation, so there are some paths and enclosures that may not be accessible. The zoo offers animals lots of space and beautiful, natural enclosures that are clean and well maintained. The animals looked healthy and well cared for. The zoo is divided into different sections, and offer a lot of animals and birds. There are plenty of benches where one can stop and watch them. There is a carousel on site (extra charge), three different opportunities for animal feedings (extra charge), and a food court. NOTE: You are allowed to take your own food/drinks inside, and there are plenty of picnic tables and grassy areas to eat at. This was a pleasant way to spend the day. NOTE: Parking rates vary, and are credit card only. "

One of my favorite walking tours ever. Don't miss it."

We all know our ancestors weren’t puritans but that remains just a suspicion.  This walking tour is proof our grandparents were as young and as enamoured of sex as were, are or will be. \n\nBravo, Carter"

But arrangements were made and we were able to do the tour, which is a big tick. The tour went through Chinatown, Honolulu which to be honest is not the top end of town.  But the detail and entertainment the tour guide provided was excellent.  I learnt so much in such a short time frame.  The walking is not taxing and we were both able to manage it quite easily.  Just a tip,  you will need to pre-arrange a taxi pick up from the tour meeting point, as this is the only way home, apart from the bus."

My 14 year old nephew was here on spring break and I wanted to introduce him to a major metropolitan city experience also. I was paired up with Wiley who had lived in Seattle for a couple years. He was very involved in theater and swing dancing. Fun, kind, engaging and chill guy. I gave him some background on my interests for me and my teenage nephew but really let him guide us thru the city. Thankfully it was a gorgeous, sunny day. Mid week,lots of tourists,activity. I have to say this would have been pretty miserable for 6 hours if it had been cold and raining! We actually cut the tour short because my nephew was exhausted and our feet were starting to ache. I was very happy with Wiley, our tour,activities,information, lunch choice and overall day. I don’t think it was a great value(good value) and I wish Wiley was a little more informative on the history of the city."

We hit the spots I most wanted to see - Pioneer square, the International areas, the Public Market, the first Starbucks - and she also highlighted so many other things along the way. Sheila gave me great backstories about Seattle and it's many attractions. She also did her homework to accommodate my food sensitivities, which was very much appreciated. This tour was very much worth it's while, especially because of my great guide."

We were so fortunate to find the trip with Nature Nuts that allowed the group a four-hour sightseeing tour of Seattle upon their arrival which worked out perfectly as the hotel was not available for them to check in so early.  Michael Joyce went above and beyond in his service to the group.  The flight was late arriving into Seattle but Mr. Joyce waited for the group and did not subtract any time from their sightseeing venture.  Upon the return to Florida, the entire group said that the tour of Seattle with Mr. Joyce was one of their memorable experiences.  We would highly recommend this company for everyone, but especially if you have a smaller group.  We, as a travel agency, will retain their information and use their services whenever we have clients going to Seattle.  You will not go wrong reaching out to Nature Nuts for all of your transportation and tour needs."

The process was smooth, however our Balloonist, Bob wasn't- due to fog and and speed- whether we were going to make it up and out that day. We had paid ahead for a special, private flight for both of us, so he waited, and tested, and waited just to make sure that we didn't miss any opportunity to make it up there.  And then, at the last moment, we did!!\n\nIt was just the two of us and a three person crew, so the entire experience felt very personable and COVID- friendly.  My husband got to help with set up and we got great pictures of inside.the balloon as it was it was inflating! Bob told of of his decades of adventures in ballooning as well as the town of Snohomish as we shot up to tall heights, from which we could see Mount Ranier, Seattle, and the San Juan Islands, then back down slightly lower again for a scenic tour of Snohomish.\n\nWe finished with a champaign toast, and a story about the history of champaign and ballooning. \n\nWe are a couple in our 40's, who have had to face a major health diagnosis, and we no longer fear going on the \"big adventure.\"  You shouldn't either.  Carpe Diem!  Book the trip!  You never know when it might be your last.. "

We finally fulfilled this with Snohomish Balloon in Winthrop WA on March 6th:) It was was so impressive to see the process on preparing the balloon for flight and the staff was friendly and made us feel at ease. We were both quite nervous about it since we weren't sure what to expect. \n    We climbed in the basket and were off floating above the world or at least it felt that way:). It was an amazing experience to see my home area from 0 to 4000 feet above the surface.  The weather and the views were so impressive and relaxing at the same time! Bob put us at ease with his knowledge and humor! We loved it! The experience was amazing and we appreciated the tight knit ballooning family that shares their passion and love for hot air ballooning! Snohomish Balloon Rides are definitely recommended! \n     Sincerely, Debbie Schrock"

Fabulous day to fly, we highly recommend the sunrise flight, we got up about 6:20 am for this, and were well prepared to get rescheduled but it was perfect an off we went. The operator is fabulous, very experienced and lots of stories about ballooning. He also made us well aware of what landing might be like. We missed our first landing due to wind so we got 20 more mins of fun. Finally the wind cooperated and we landed in a really nice couple's back yard. Super nice people and my boyfriend got to assist in getting the balloon in the right spot for others to get out. Super adventurous, exciting, breath-taking views. This was a bucket list item for us but we are SO going to do it again. These folks are fabulous and the celebration mimosa at the end was the cherry on top. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. You will not regret it, also no motion sickness and don't look down and you'll be fine. It was perfect, worth every penny!"

    "description": "Center of Seattle’s LGBTQ community for years, \"the hill\" is vibrant, inclusive and delights with small independent shops, booming nightlife and attitude. We will learn about it's history and visit one of Seattle’s oldest parks with great views of the Space Needle. Along the way, we will check out a few of Seattle’s best book stores, some great record shops, sample locally made ice cream and confections, enjoy the best espresso in the city (in my opinion!) and see some of the most famous bars and live music venues in the city. This is a great way to plan your weekend agenda while in town if nightlife is your thing! These are the places I take my friends and family when they visit, I'd like to share them with you!\n\nWith a max of 3 people, or 4 if you all know each other, this is a personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places you won't find in most guidebooks. Come explore with a 30 year local!\n",
