It&apos;s athleisure, but I can actually wear them to work. I have not taken them out on the trail yet, but intend to soon (once it cools off a bit).\n\nAs far as fit, the waist runs true to size. I typically wear a 38 waist and the 38 waist fit&apos;s perfectly. In fact, it fits snug, but not tight nor loose. The length, however, was an issue. Typically I can get away with a 32&quot; length (I like my cuffs to rest on the top of my foot because I am barefoot more often than not), but I needed the 34 length just to get to the top of my foot. So I would recommend sizing up one size for length.\n\nAll things said, I have nothing bad to say about these pants. I&apos;ll probably buy at least one more pair in the future.",

They look nice like regular work pants but are way more functional. The fabric is really sturdy but lightweight. The black is super sleek, buying a couple other colors for him. He is a 33x33 so usually in between sizes, 34x32 fits him well. The legs are little wide but that’s the only imperfection. Great pants.",

The issue I came across was that once my hands got wet the gloves were difficult to get on. The size I ordered was based on the manufacture&apos;s sizing guide. After struggling for several minutes to get the gloves over wet hands the fit was fine. I would not recommend these for anyone who is planing to use them for water rescue operations. Better off using using 2mm neoprene glove.",

It has proven its durability. So much storage areas and various sized pockets that I can find a place for any running essential. After long runs, I just toss it in the washer therefore it has even lasted through many washing machine cycles. I am not a fan of the insulated bladder it comes with so I replace it with a regular 2L Nathan bladder - I find these to be much easier to fill and MUCH easier to clean as you can turn them inside out. No amount of insulation can survive the AZ heat so it wasn&apos;t a feature that was important or beneficial to me. A great vest overall!",

Otherwise, the fit, the water not sloshing, the ease of cleaning bladder and tube, front pocket set ups are all amazing. I highly recommend this pack but wish their were other color options.",

I’m a Nathan fan and have 4 vests that I rotate. The blue unisex pinnacle is my favorite one.

        "reviewBody": "I bought this harness a few months ago and I really enjoy using it. I&apos;m a man, but my legs are too large for the men&apos;s medium, and my waist is too small for the men&apos;s large, so this worked perfectly, since black diamond makes their women&apos;s harness&apos; legs larger relative to the waist. It&apos;s super comfortable, fits great, very lightweight, and also easy to use. The only adjustment being the waist is quick and easy, and the buckle feels like a nicer material than their cheaper products like the Momentum (which use a still strong, but cheaper feeling plastic). The belay loop si really thickly woven and the hard points are reinforced with a hard material beneath the surface material, so I know I&apos;ll be able to use the harness for a while. The waist and leg loops are wide, making for a really comfortable sit while belaying and hanging. It&apos;s a very straightforward harness that feels really good. My only complaint is that the gearloops are lacking. They&apos;re small, and there are only four of them. This isn&apos;t a problem for the gym or 99% of single pitches, but anytime I want to bring extra gear for safety when I&apos;m going outside, it can be tough to comfortably fit everything I need (2 belay devices, 8 carabiners, rescue loop, 2 alpine draws, a set of quickdraws, a cordelette, etc.). Otherwise, it&apos;s perfect and does exactly what I want it to.",

I have recently purchased a few other pairs of boots at the same price point and these were by far the worst. They also never even sent me the boot care kit I ordered. These shoes are not quality point blank. Thursdays boots are a much higher quality boot with more options at the same price point.",

The problem that Timberland has is that they are putting cheaper materials inside, and thats where they starting to fall apart. The rest of the boots are great but if a boot is premium DONT place cheap insole or cheap lining. I want my leather orange insole. You already did the same with my Premiums rubber toe Heritage! (If you dont post this review i will start writing all the time and putting all over the internet. Because i have bought to many boots and you are ruining the brand putting cheaper materials in linings and insoles)",

It doesn&apos;t have the needed support for trail running, it keeps pushing my feet to the inside although I don&apos;t have pronation issue, too wide, and the shoelaces are too long that I had to cut them. Also, I got the black color and it&apos;s so not suitable for trail running. Too expensive for the quality I got. I was really disappointed. Unfortunately I ordered it online from the US and my friend got it for me where I live and I couldn&apos;t return it. What a waste of money!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought a few different packs to try, in search of a pack that can double as a vacation travel pack for airline/bus travel, easily fit under airline seat, but also get me to professional office meetings when I have to travel for work without looking too-outdoorsy/rugged, and this fits that bill perfectly. I love the simplicity and sleekness of the pack, and the fact it seems rugged/weather-resistant enough to handle at least some light rain during transport. \n\nThere are only a couple of possible minor things that detract from a 100% winner for some people. One is if it&apos;s wet, inside the pack there is lack of any flap to fold OVER the top of the laptop sleeve inside the pack, so if the pack were still a little wet when you open, some water might drip down right into the vital ports/vents in the end of the laptop, or i suppose if pack was upside down the laptop could slide out (rare in my opinion). The only other thing I would improve is perhaps attach the straps a little different somehow so the pack doesn&apos;t hang out so far from the shoulders. I tested a couple of other packs and some (such as the latest Osprey Archeon 24L) felt much more snug/streamlined against the body. That said, I&apos;m actually keeping this Chasm pack due to it being a little more clean/office-friendly looking for my needs.\n\nThere is one full-length major pocket which is the majority of the pack, but also another, slim full-size pocket that runs the full height of the pack, which I could see works well for some people and not others. If the main pocket were packed tight, it might be hard to get to items that may be at the bottom of the slim pocket, but there are already a variety of accessory pockets in that slim pocket, so to me the full-length is a benefit, to handle long items, or slip a jacket/sweatshirt down in without opening the main chasm. \n\nThe pack doesn&apos;t have the flattest bottom, so may not say sitting up on end, and that may bother some people looking to use as an everyday office laptop bag, but to me that&apos;s minor, i probably will have it leaning against a desk or chair anyway, and helps improve the look without a rigid/flat bottom.\n\nI also like the the zippers to the main compartments are in more of a U-shape, because on a plan I always slide my pack under the seat with shiny-outer side down, and straps up, that way I&apos;m not transporting whatever junk is on the ground directly to the back of my shirt, and for that, the placement of these zippers is great, without all of your stuff falling out when you get into the pack. The small top-pouch zipper is just exposed mesh to the inside main cavity, but is very thick/fuzzy on the top/outer part of the pack to keep items (sunglasses /headphones) well protected from a random bump or smash.\n\nI really like the side-handle and size-laptop zip to easily get laptop out for something like TSA/airport security if needed, or just quick/easy access without exposing everything that&apos;s in your bag. Due to that side-zip and sturdy side handle, there is only a water-bottle pocket on one side, but I don&apos;t see that as a problem since 99% of the time i have only one bottle. I also really appreciate this has a little strap horizontally in the back-padding for slipping this pack over the handles of a carry-on roll-aboard airline luggage, so this pack is a perfect personal item/pack for most airline travel (except some of those small planes or budget US/euro airlines). You wouldn&apos;t want a pack that was any bigger if you plan to put it under an airline seat.\n\nOverall, pretty stoked on this pack, Thule does a good job and makes clean/pro looking packs. If it looks like it fits your needs, this is the one.",

They are all size large and all form fitting, typical Castelli snug fit and sizing.\n\nI tried the Polare 3 bib tights in a size large and they were way too big through the hips, so I tried the size medium. The mediums do fit, but there are thick, bulky fabric seams below the knees, and the shoulder straps are cheap and super tight. These are very uncomfortable bib shorts, and sized unlike any other Castelli bibs I’ve ever owned. The bulky leg seams are a real surprise, never seen anything like it in other Castelli kit.\n\nReturned.",

I&apos;ve ridden these quite a bit this winter in Southern New England. Depending on conditions, I choose these, or the Tuto Nano which is lighter construction without the Gore-Tex Infinium layer on front. These are great and have given me access to many colder days (near freezing) when I&apos;d otherwise be unable to ride.  An unsurprising consequence (on reflection) is that they do require more work to ride.  I find I can easily do 20-25 road miles in these, but at 30-35 I would be starting to flag. I notice it when riding in groups more so than alone.  I don&apos;t experience this with the Tuto Nano.  My unscientific read on that is that there is more bulk and fabric and that presents more resistance and more work.  I don&apos;t have a power meter on my winter/gravel bikes so no deeper analysis. I&apos;ve also used for colder gravel and dirt/ice roads and they have held up through a number of falls (and cleaning) without issue.  The fit, wear and warmth have all met or exceeded my expectations.",

Here&apos;s why.\n\n- The seams haven&apos;t showed any signs of tearing, which is important in a winter bib that takes a good amount of tugging and yanking to get on.\n\n-It&apos;s warm enough in the coldest conditions yet not unpleasantly hot if a cold morning ride ends in the high 40s or low 50s.\n\n-The reflective aspects are key for rides in the early morning or after dusk.\n\nNote: I typically wear a pair of shorts (full on padded bike shorts) beneath this bib. I like the added cushion and protection it provides against the wind. The other bonus is that it usually means I only need to wash the shorts unless the ride is really long. Gross.

The previous generation seemed incrementally too small for me, these fit great. The previous generation seemed to bind up in weird places and were a bit of a hassle to get on, these are comfortable and a treat to put on. The ankle zips have been moved to the side where they&apos;re much easier to operate, which eliminates one of the more annoying quirks of the previous generation.  The materials and workmanship on both are, of course, top notch. The only thing I don&apos;t understand is why they still equip this tight with their KISS AIR 2 pad instead of their top-of-the-line Progetto X2 AIR pad. Both are great pads, I&apos;d just prefer the nicer option in these otherwise top-of-the-line tights. \n\nI can only really comment on their performance in cold, dry weather, but so far, they&apos;ve been great in the upper 20F temps we&apos;ve been having here in Chicago. I plan on getting another pair or two since they&apos;re considerably nicer than my other winter tights (PI AmFib) and probably 90% as capable.",

        "reviewBody": "Mammut is a company that I love, like, and hate. No other company exists in the space of my outdoor equipment consumer heart. I love Mammut&apos;s rain gear and hard shells. I have Mammut hiking shoes I treasure but boots that, no matter what, I can&apos;t find in the correct size. (I&apos;ve sent back more of Mammut&apos;s footwear than I care to count.) I love Mammut&apos;s outdoor clothing, which might run a size smaller than I normally wear or two sizes larger. This is my first Mammut pack, which was originally sold for a ridiculous price and that I picked up for a ridiculously low price.\n\nSo the good part. If I were going out on a summer trail with just my water bladder, a rain coat, a few snacks, and a DSLR with a wide angle lens, this bag would be nice. The bag is well made. It&apos;s very comfortable. It&apos;s a roomy 15L. The upper pocket, where you might store sunglasses and/or food, is a great size. The compartment at the front of the bag has lots of space. The frame and it&apos;s support system are comfortable. The hip belt and shoulder straps are comfortable, even for this 230 pound hiker. The bag meets all the minimum requirements. If those are what you&apos;re looking for, this bag is for you!\n\nHowever, if I&apos;m going out in winter with that season&apos;s demanding list of items, this bag isn&apos;t going to meet my needs. And that&apos;s a disappointment.\n\nI pushed the capabilities of the pack on my first time out. Here&apos;s what I found. \n\nThe bladder storage is in the bag&apos;s main compartment and uses a pocket to hold the bladder close to the frame. A valve exit is on the upper right shoulder of the bag, so you&apos;re limited to the valve and hose being on the right. The loops for the valve are small. I didn&apos;t love this.\n\nThe bladder configuration has disaster written all over it. If a leak were to develop, there is no place for the water to go except into the bag&apos;s main compartment. There is no drain. The last thing I need is a bladder leaking all over my down coat if things go wrong, and, eventually, things always go wrong.\n\nAttaching trekking poles to the pack is frustrating. The top elastic loop is on the left side of the pack, with a single, standard loop on the left side of the pack&apos;s base. I found it very difficult to get both tips of my three-section Leki poles through the single lower loop and the cork uppers through the elastic loop so that the poles felt securely affixed to the pack. And so, as expected, the poles kept coming out of their holds. This was a HUGE hassle. I gave up carrying the poles after about 300 yards.\n\nI&apos;ve never had a problem keeping poles affixed to other packs. Not being able to carry trekking poles feels like a significant design flaw. I&apos;ve come to expect this feature on all of my packs. And did I mention things eventually going wrong? Loose trekking pole tips and bladders together never seem like a good idea.\n\nI brought along my ice kleets on this audition. These did a great job of bringing to light another of the bag&apos;s shortcomings: there is no way to attach things to the bag without the item flopping around, at least not using something designed to meet this requirement. \n\nMy ice kleets are carried in a heavy, cloth bag with a drawstring and loop on the bag. On previous packs, I&apos;ve used the loop as an attachment point. Alas, the Mammut bag does not have a way to attach the kleet bag... Unless you use one of the compression straps looped through the kleet bag. This is definitely not what the compression strap was meant for and, so, the solution is rather kludgey.\n\nIf I had paid more for this pack, it would be going back. However, since I paid what I consider a low price for it, I&apos;ll use it in the summer when I often pick up rocks, take meat and cheese along for my hike, and seem to seek out rain. (I didn&apos;t get to try the pack&apos;s rain shell.) I really do love to be out in the rain. This pack will serve that purpose well, I hope.",

After a week, the stitching to the outside of your hand next to the velcro loop started pulling apart.  Mind you.  I bought 4 pairs and wear different ones each ride.  A year later, 3 of them have this same issue.  I never had this issue with the Pearl Izumi&apos;s.  I only replaced them because they were getting a little bit worn after years of use.  I&apos;m going back to them for my next batch.",

There is not much traction or soul on the bottom, so they aren&apos;t good for walking around outside of your tent like I was hoping for. I have use them for bikepacking, and they were very packable and lightweight. Unfortunately because they weren&apos;t durable on the bottom for wearing around outside I wore through them quickly and also water with seep up through the bottom walking through damp grass in the morning. I upgraded to a pair with rubber soles (north face), so that I can wear them around camp and not just inside or inside a tent.",

They&apos;re comfortable and fit relatively well, though for my specific hands, the fingers of the gloves are just a tad too long, like 1/4&quot;. The leather is nice, and they&apos;re relatively warm. I wouldn&apos;t really use them for resort skiing, unless it was a particularly warm day, say 30F and sunny. I would say they&apos;re pretty great for touring down to 20, without much wind.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I&apos;m one of those that have persistently cold hands. If you&apos;re hands are never cold, you could wear these at colder temps.",

The issue i am having with these gloves is that when I take them off to get something or scratch my nose, the inside liner goes out of whack with the exterior part for my pinky finger and is difficult to align back together. The fingers part is bulky and difficult to grab zippers for me so that is why i have to be taking the gloves off and on.",

        "reviewBody": "I have two pair of these gloves. I grabbed them when they were on a really good sale a couple of months ago. At no more than 50% of the &quot;retail&quot; price, I&apos;d say they are an OK buy. \n\nThe quality of the leather isn&apos;t great. At only 5-6 days of snowboarding, I started to notice little spots where the top layer of the leather is wearing off from handling my board, strapping in, etc. They are still in tact, but you can see little grey spots showing through the black leather. Rubbed some Obenauf&apos;s LP on the spots, and chalked it up to just being a bit of a &quot;value&quot; material. Not THAT big of a deal, but we&apos;ll see how long they hold up. \n\nHowever, they do have somewhat of a fatal flaw. The lining isn&apos;t sufficiently attached to the outer shell. this causes two problems. The first is that the lining moving inside the glove causes a &quot;slippery&quot; feeling anytime you grab something, which really kills dexterity. The second (and most important), is that if your hands are at all damp or sweaty, the lining inside the fingers pulls out every time you take the gloves off, and is a real pain to get back in place. I&apos;ve never experienced this with any other ski glove I&apos;ve owned, so I&apos;m not sure how it was overlooked. \n\nAt a really good clearance price, these are still a decent value for resort riding, but anywhere near full price and I&apos;d be very disappointed. If BC would have just put a hair more thought into the issues noted above, they would be a seriously great glove. Even at full price. The fit and features are on point.",

To get to red, all you have to do is light up the white light on its lowest setting, hold the button down and it swtches to red - which makes sense if you need to turn to talk to someone in the dark.

        "reviewBody": "As a backpacker, ice climber, and general outdoor guy I’ve had a ton of headlamps in 30 years.  Huge fan of Petzl lights and never had one fail me.  The core battery is excellent and holds a solid charge.  Also easy to charge with a power bank while out on a 2-3 night trip.\nI currently own an Actik (400l), the Swift SL, and now this one.  I was intrigued but the upgraded options compared to the 400L model.  Really everything I would like changed: light pivots better from middle (like the swift reactive), has a lock on the improved button, battery level gauge, easier to tighten strap, Orange model (to find easy), a bit brighter first click, and the glow in the dark circle which makes it easy to find at night (great idea).\nI’ve used on my past 3 trips and really like.  I’ve been using my swift SL, which adjusts the beam and has cool features, but this seems like a solid go-to and maybe better in winter compared.  Only small issues is getting to the battery and door open.  It’s behind the pivot and it has to shift forward a bit to get to door, funky first , op and other times you do it.  They very sealed door was super hard to get open the first time. Was very tight and I almost needed a tool, and you use your fingernail for that!  Once open 1-2x, it’s easier for sure….just very tight.  If you like Petzl lights, or have had BD issues, this is worth a look.",

        "reviewBody": "I finally broke one of my Traverse ski poles after 12 years of abuse. Great pole. Of course, I thought the new Traverse Pro would be a better replacement than sticking with the original. I wasn&apos;t sure about the breakaway wrist straps, but the new FlickLock mechanism and lighter weight sold me. These two features are great, but the grips/straps leave a bit to be desired. First, the grip is shorter from top to bottom than on my original Traverse poles, with a much more pronounced bottom prominence. I&apos;m a pretty average sized guy, 5&apos;10&apos;&apos;, 180, who wears a size large glove/mitten, and this grip immediately felt really small. After a few tours I couldn&apos;t stand it and had to use a bench belt sander to grind off the bottom rubber prominence. They are much better now as I don&apos;t feel like my hand is pushed over the top of the grip all the time, but if you&apos;ve got XL hands, this might not be the pole for you. Also, since I don&apos;t ski with wrist straps in avy terrain, I pulled off the included straps, but the quick release mechanisms are still in place in the grip. Now there is a little rattle with every pole plant. Not major, but annoying. The weight savings from the classic Traverse Poles may not be 100% worth it for the extra cash, but the poles are super sturdy and ski well.",

It&apos;s a little non-obvious about the lock and unlock for adjusting the wrist straps, but not difficult one you understand that you actually flip the tap all the way around to go from unlocked to locked. I also found that putting a little wax on the threads to put on the baskets, and using as much downward pressure (with the handle on the floor) as I could finally got the baskets on. I don&apos;t mind that it was a bit hard, there&apos;s no chance they&apos;ll come off accidentally, but if you don&apos;t have much arm strength you may need some help putting the baskets on.",

I was pleasantly surprised at the performance these wheels gave while still being easy to setup and service. Setting the tire bead on the rim was a breeze, and it wasn&apos;t a giant pain to pop the bead if I needed to add more sealant. The new Vision hubs are also a real treat because they use a ratchet ring that is similar to the ever reliable DT Swiss EXP hubs. They are also LOUD. If you want a great sounding loud hub, these are the ticket. The wheels come with tubeless tape and stems, and a great storage bag that I wasn&apos;t expecting. The ride quality of the wheels is great, and the aero is everything you would expect from a tour winning product. It&apos;s like a combo of my favorite things from Zipp and Roval. Overall would absolutely recommend these wheels.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve been running these on my road bike for a few months and love ‘em. \n\nThe important details:\n1. 21mm internal width with a hooked bead\n2. 45mm rim depth\n3. PRS ratchet hub with a 5 degree engagement angle\n4. I weighed mine at 1,521g with rim tape, valves, and lockrings.\n5. No rider weight limit on these or any other FSA/Vision wheelset\n\nThese really are one wheel to do it all. I’m a fan of running as deep a wheel as you can get away with, and where I live (Front Range of Colorado), it’s important to consider weight and crosswinds. 40-50mm depth wheels are perfect for me and most of my riding. \n\nI’ve got some 28mm Vittoria Corsa Next (my favorite road tire) set up tubeless on these. These have a hooked bead, so you can run whatever tires you want, with or without tubes. I have had good experiences with hookless road wheels, but having the flexibility of a hooked bead IS nice. \n\nThese are a pro level wheel, but they strike a reasonable balance between stiffness and comfort. That may come down to my preference of tubeless and corresponding lower pressures, but they also spin up pretty effortlessly and hold speed better than any other wheel I’ve ridden in this depth range. No perceptible lateral flex when sprinting; you get that nice “kck kck kck” as you sway the bike out of the saddle.\n\nNo issues with spoke creak or detensioning (I didn’t check spoke tension out of the box). I usually prefer j bend spokes for ease of service but these straight pull spokes have been solid (they do look cool too) and they tend to be a tiny bit lighter than j bend. \n\nThe rear hub is objectively loud, especially at speed. Pretty typical deep thrum you hear from hubs with ratchet internals. \n\nThese come with a rim strip installed, but tubeless tape and valves are included, along with some nice simple wheel bags for travel. They also come with internally-splined rotor lockrings and a cassette spacer.\n\nIf you’re looking for a top tier mid-depth wheelset with a hooked rim, you can’t go wrong with these. These would pair well with an endurance bike, they could be a gravel race option, or even as a shallower choice for an aero race bike. They’re lightweight, especially for this rim depth. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me or any other bike Gearhead here with questions or if you’re interested in choosing these for a custom build with us!\n\n#CompetitiveCyclistGearheads #BackcountryGearheads",

Riding down a modest hill (4%) in 45 to 50 degree weather you can feel the cold on your hips and in your groin.  It does not block out the wind.  I have worn them with sun skins underneath and the legs feel comfortable in wind.  Would have to wear some kind of liner for the hips, etc. to get the same wind relief, but that is not really the way these are supposed to work.  They fit well and are stylish, but I am not sure why they cost more than the FR-C version.",

I never got to fully explore the photochromic lenses as the optical quality was too distracting to want to wear them very long.  I returned them immediately.",

They transition plenty dark enough for sunny days above tree-line, but change quickly enough so that I can keep them on while passing through forests. The lenses are big enough and bottom frame small enough so that seeing my feet in my peripheral is not an issue. They are also incredibly lightweight which means you can keep them on for all-day efforts without annoyance.",

Not only does it wick, breathe, and dry quickly, nothing even comes close to its feel against the skin—luxuriously comfortable. The material can snag on stuff relatively easy though if you’re wearing it by itself, but under a shell or jacket/pants it keeps me warm and dry better than anything else I’ve worn",

When I called, after not receiving my order, I was told it was instead shipped economy, which takes 10-14 days.  The rep said, “this just happens sometimes”.  If you’re expecting your order within a certain timeline, buy from another site. This company should not be trusted.",

        "reviewBody": "Materials felt great and surprisingly lightweight.  Zipper was mediocre.  Three of the baffles (front and back) had very little down in them.  Backcountry support was rather unhelpful and told me to contact Western Mountaineering directly.  Western Mountaineering support was very friendly and quick to respond, offered troubleshooting steps, and ultimately offered to refill the empty baffles if I paid to ship the bag back to them.  Felt that I shouldn&apos;t have to pay out of pocket to fix a manufacturer&apos;s defect on a brand new item, so ended up returning the bag to Backcountry.  It&apos;s a shame, I wanted to love it, but for such an expensive item I would expect better quality control.",

I will be using this winter when I am primitive camping in Florida. I live in Florida so I also sleep in it in the summer season I just change my sleep pads, summer pad and my winter pad. I recommend the mega lite it’s definitely worth the price.",

If there was a way to adjust the strings to loosen them, then I think I would love this shoe.  It would also help to get them on the foot easier.

They’re ergonomic (nice wide toe box and flexible sole), great quality, so cute and my daughter can easily take them on and off by herself. They’re amazing. In fact I plan to buy her another pair this year. The same cannot be said for these shoes. They’re still great quality and ergonomic, but they are SO DIFFICULT to put on. Don’t let the Velcro fool you. The elastic band (which is what REALLY holds the shoe on the foot) is super inflexible so I can’t open them wide enough to put her foot in. It’s not impossible, but it’s such a challenge that I rarely bother. At which point…I’m just paying good money for shoes that sit in the closet.",

        "reviewBody": "Updating after a full 16 months or so of heavy use - I think I logged close to 300 miles in these things. \nThe folding issue I mentioned below stopped after about a year, but the sides are now folding and I&apos;m starting to get blisters on the balls of my feet, and even just got some on the side after completing Wilson Peak, Mt. Wilson, and El Diente in the San Juans of Colorado, which has never happened before. \nI think they&apos;ve just worn out - they&apos;re much lighter and thinner than my Vioz GTXs, which is a good thing, but at the same time, I think that impacts their durability. \n\nThese boots are still amazing and very comfortable - and they would probably last longer for someone doing more casual hikes. I have used them almost exclusively on very rugged 14ers (I think I&apos;ve done about 20-25 of them in this pair alone, plus 50 miles in Glacier in July 2021). \n\nSo I think I&apos;m gonna go back to the Vioz GTXs and just buy a new pair. Those are such heavy things but I never once got a blister in them so I trust them more. \n\n\n****\nI love Zamberlan boots and wanted desperately to give this 5 stars, but I&apos;m experiencing some issues with this pair. \n\nFirst, the pros: \nThe vibram sole is super grippy and seems to be much more durable than the type found on my previous pair, the Zamberlan Vioz GTX&apos;s  \nThe ankle and arch support is phenomenal. Every time I&apos;ve come close to rolling an ankle, the boot&apos;s structure seems to keep things in check. The bottoms of my feet feel great even after 10+ mile slogs. \nThey are much lighter than the Vioz&apos;s and the craftsmanship feels superb. You can cruise through scree, sharp rocks, boulder fields, anything a 14er might throw at you, and trust you&apos;ll be fine. \n\nAlas the cons: \nGoing uphill, they feel perfect. But going downhill, the boot must fold in such a way that it makes contact with the top of my foot an inch or two below the base knuckle of my big toe - and it hurts quite a bit. \nZamberlan boots don&apos;t typically require a break-in period, and I&apos;ve worn these on at least 4 hikes, and probably 40-50 miles, and it&apos;s still happening. \nI worry it&apos;s going to be a permanent thing. \nI wear thick Darn Tough socks (the best out there) for hiking, and still seem to be experiencing discomfort. \n\nI&apos;m going to keep at it with these boots and hope the downhill issue goes away, but if not, it could mean going for a different pair much sooner than expected, which would be a real shame as these are pricey.",

        "reviewBody": "Zamberlan has surpassed my wildest hopes and dreams with this boot. I purchased these to guide a 45 day backpacking trip in the Brooks Range of Alaska. I went with the 1110 Baltoro Lite GTX RR to replace my worn out pair of Zamberlan 996 Vioz GTX boots, hoping to to shave significant weight while retaining unparalleled ankle support, aggressive tread, and durability. I was extremely impressed; these boots stood up to the brutally demanding terrain of off-trail travel through the Brooks. The Perwanger leather and generous tough rubber rands withstood beatings from rock and gravel bar walking, thick willow brush, and sharp talus, all while constantly soaked from frequent river crossings. Rain, snow, ice, or shine, the tread provided excellent, dependable traction. The lacing system of these is easy, secure, and reliable with the tough laces and hardware. As a wilderness backpacking guide, I have seen other big brands&apos; boots succumb to the rigors of the tough terrain of the tundra. From my experience with these (lightweight) tanks I cannot recommend them highly enough!",

This tool makes fast work out of digging cat holes, even in very tough ground. The handle is very comfortable and the stuff bag keeps my other toiletries clean. The hollow handle allows me to store emergency toilet paper. \n\nThe only reason I didn&apos;t give it 5 stars is because the locking pin doesn&apos;t work very well. It gets stuck and is hard to push. I fixed this by replacing it with a plastic version I got from a pool supply store for swimming pool poles. This may become a problem if it breaks in the future.

        "reviewBody": "I recently purchased these in dusty olive. I needed a solid pair of slip on and the usually suspects of cheap throw aways weren’t cutting it anymore. \n\nI wear a 11 in z/1’s and 10.5 in shoes. I purchased these in 11 and hoped for the best. They fit perfectly. Quite honestly the 10’s would have been too small. The clog has a great foot bed as its  soft and a little bit curved. Your foot just slides in nicely. The clog itself is really well made and feels like a good product. The tread is fantastic and the clog is warm without being sweaty. I work outside doing walk and wade trips and am on my feet on average 10 hours a day. My feet are tired and sore by the end of the day and I wanted some relief as I recoup at night. Trips continue into the winter as I stay busy all year. I didn’t want to face another season with thin soled crappy slip ons. These really fit the bill. I caught my wife wearing them (although way too big on her) around the house when I came home. They meet her approval as well. \n\nAlright, enough babbling about myself. These are great slip ons. I will buy again is they ever break rip or tear beyond repair. If you are thinking about this purchase and am not sure take it from this stranger, you will not be disappointed. If you have really wide feet though they may fit a little snug. I’m happy.\n\nWarm\nCurved footbed\nSolid exterior\nGood grip\nAdjustable strap for customized fit",

There are a couple issues with it, in my opinion, though. \n\nFirstly, it&apos;s super stiff, especially on the edges, and that makes it a bit uncomfortable. I assume it will break-in in time, but it&apos;s not great in the near-term.\n\nSecond, and more annoyingly, the tolerances on the belt size and the size of the hole on the buckle is so tight that it&apos;s actively hard to put on. It&apos;s like, weirdly difficult to put the belt through the buckle, and that&apos;s just a weird and super annoying issue. I hope that it gets easier as the belt wears in and gets more flexible, but it&apos;s really annoying.",

Keep a look out for the toe box, it may just be my foot shape but it did graze the side of my big toe a good amount. Stick to your day to day shoe size, it’s sized down a bit just as the rentals would be.  Still I very much recommend it as a step up to a higher level of climbing",

Fore foot fits my medium to wide feet fine. Heel is really nice and snug and much better than the Scarpa Origins &amp; Reflex (42.5) I&apos;ve tried where the heel slingshot rand pulls tight on the back of my Achilles/Heel causing pain. Compared to tarantulas/laces (40.5), heel feels a bit more snug and the fore foot is wider on the MadRocks. Other shoes I wear, Evolv Shaman &amp; Zenists (US 10.5), Scarpa Instinct VSR (42.5),  Ocun Ozone HV (US 9.5).",

I have 2 pairs of the plastic Gizeh-style Birkenstocks and they do seem a tad large, so I figured I&apos;d try the 39&apos;s. Unfortunately, they just barely fit. My short toes went right to the very end. Returning for the larger size.\n\nI&apos;ve never owned a pair of leather Birkenstocks, but I&apos;m excited to wear what I know will be good for my feet. I suffer terribly from Plantar Fasciitis. The plastic Birkenstocks have been the only thing that gave me relief. Since I can&apos;t wear socks with the Gizeh style I have, I need something I can wear around the house during the colder months to keep my Plantar Fasciitis in check. I can&apos;t wait to receive the larger size.",

And the marble print really beautiful. Lucky to get them on sale, pockets are nice and deep. To hold my phone. I just wish the pockets were secured by a zipper. I bought the matching jacket also. And added snaps to the slip in pockets. I have gotten lots of compliments. People are amused by them.",

I never met anyone who had one that didn&apos;t leak, take up a lot of space in their pack when full, or generally just have trouble with them. I really liked how this water bladder acted like reservoir for filling up larger pots for boiling water, I like how the connection from the water bladder to the hose is secure and easy. I also thought that the mouthpiece on the hose was nice. Instead of hanging the water in the pack towards your back I opted to put the water on top of my gear just under the brain of my pack. I definitely lined my pack with a garbage bag before I did this in case there was a leak. But there was none. I liked having the water bladder there for refill and access to the hose. I took a short day hike with my pack and instead hung the water bladder closest to the back of the pack and it worked really well there as well. I really enjoyed this water bladder I thought that it was really great for not only base camp but also for having in your pack. I especially liked how there was a magnet which could hook onto your chest strap in order to hang your mouthpiece so that it didn&apos;t get dirty.",

I liked how there were different ways to use it (backpack mode, camp mode, etc) but didn’t really use it for anything other than in my backpack because an actual water bottle felt more practical at camp. I previously had a 2L Osprey hydration pack but wanted to upgrade to a 3L pack instead. My biggest complaint about this product compared to the Osprey is that it was extremely difficult to get it to dry after using it. I’m sure it would be easier with a tool to reach inside or a hair dryer, but I hadn’t bought the cleaning accessory pack and was traveling for a few more weeks after using it. I tried shaking it over and over again, but it took about 4 days to fully dry on its own with the screw top open. Overall, I prefer the Osprey hydration pack because it has a wider opening and allows you to reach a hand in to clean and dry it without having to purchase an additional accessory kit like you would have to for the Gregory pack.",

The kind that makes you feel like the trailblazing hero of an action packed blockbuster, where the grey symbolizes the calm before the storm, the thrilling descent, the daring jumps, and the enviable Instagram snaps.\r\n\r\nLet&apos;s break it down. First off, the color: this isn’t just grey, it’s the kind of grey that whispers sophistication and screams adventure. It’s as if Fox Racing distilled the essence of a storm cloud and forged a helmet out of it. This helmet isn’t just wearing a color; it’s wearing an attitude.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the MIPS technology, it’s not magic, but it might as well be. For those who aren&apos;t in the know, MIPS stands for Multi-Directional Impact Protection System. It’s like having a personal bodyguard for your brain, subtly hidden beneath that stormy exterior. It’s reassuring to know that while you’re out pushing your limits, your helmet is there to cradle your grey matter like a protective parent.\r\n\r\nComfort and ventilation? Check and check. It feels like Fox Racing hooked up a little AC unit in there. Your head stays cool, even when you’re powering up those killer climbs or bombing down tracks that make your heart race.\r\n\r\nThe visor is yet another highlight, fully adjustable and just the right size to make you feel like you&apos;re in a fighter jet cockpit. It’s not just about blocking the sun, it’s about framing your field of vision so every ride feels epic.",

        "reviewBody": "In my current MTB helmet quiver, I have the Fox Dropframe, the Fox Speedframe Pro, and this Fox Speedframe - brand loyalty much?\n\nI&apos;ve ridden POC, 661, Bontrager, Giro and Fox over the last few years and this helmet has quickly become my favorite.  The Speedframe has an awesome fit with great back-of-head coverage and a nice visor location. It looks great with my big glasses, doesn&apos;t hold too much sweat, doesn&apos;t bounce around, and the fit dial on the back is easy to adjust with gloves. \n\nI use this for probably 80% of my MTB rides as well as commuting and my gravel rides. It&apos;s not heavy enough to warrant a gravel-specific helmet and it&apos;s stylish as an everyday lid. I use the Dropframe for the rowdier stuff where I need to feel more protected (read: confident). \n\nNotable differences between this and the Pro version are the magnetic stap buckle on the Pro, which I love, but isn&apos;t a deal-breaker on this helmet. I use this one more than my Speedframe Pro because for some reason the MIPS on that one squeaks a lot and bugs me as it bounces around a bit when I ride. For whatever reason, this one doesn&apos;t so the regular Speedframe it is!\n\nThis helmet provides adequate protection for most of my riding, has a great fit, has great vents and doesn&apos;t get too hot, fits well with a skull cap under it in the colder months and comes in great colors - what more can you ask for?\n\nThanks for caring about my brains more than I do (sometimes), Fox!",

        "reviewBody": "This helmet has all the features that a good trail/enduro lid has along with the looks of a top tier helmet. I got the black in a size large and it fit my generally oval shaped head well front to back. It does have some extra room on the sides which means it&apos;s still a good fit if your head shape is a little rounder. The retention system wraps around your head like most helmets like this do, but this is the first one I&apos;ve had that is as well padded at the front. The interior shape of the helmet felt very comfortable.\nThe one thing I&apos;m constantly looking for in a helmet is the ventilation. I live in Texas and having a lid that stays cool is huge. While you can&apos;t see through the helmet like I can with some of my other helmets due to their number of vents. This lid has been surprisingly airy feeling. The only problem is I got the matte black and I&apos;ll be interested see how hot it gets in the blazing summer sun.\nOther than the black color, my only other complaint is the lack of a light/gopro mount. At this price you shouldn&apos;t expect that feature, but I do a fair amount of night riding and appreciate a solid place to mount the lights.\nI was really impressed with this helmet. For now it will make a great daytime trail lid. We&apos;ll see how it does when the central TX furnace kicks on.",

        "reviewBody": "I would make a list of pros and cons, but very seriously I have no cons. I genuinely enjoy just about everything about this helmet. I was hesitant to give it a go because I have an extremely small head. So much so that in the past I have had to default to kids sizing to find something that would fit, which usually means giving up some of the luxuries of an adult helmet such as breathability and just general quality. This fits right on par with the size chart and the adjustment system accommodates round and oval head sizes. Once locked down it passes a shake test and is pretty comfortable throughout a long ride.\n\nIt gives deep enough coverage in the back to make me feel comfortable when things get spicier than intended and is plenty breathable.\n\nI also want to call out that yes there are things that could make this better, but at the price point it is hard to beat and you can always upgrade to the Pro version if you are looking for those added features. It gives deep enough coverage in the back to make me feel comfortable when things get spicier than intended",

The MIPS buttons rip my hair out every time I take the helmet off my head, so I often have to sit there and try to untangle the hair so I don&apos;t lose big chunks every time I take the helmet on and off.

        "reviewBody": "I got the Revive to replace the stock RockShock/Reverb that comes with the Santa Cruz. The Reverb would consistently get squishy, even after a single ride.\n\nGenerally a thumbs up. \n\nBut a few notes for buyers:\n- It&apos;s heavier than the Reverb \n- Installation isn&apos;t trivial, I had to take it to the shop although there are good YouTube how-tos\n- It&apos;s cable not hydraulic so if you&apos;re replacing a Reverb, you&apos;re also going to need a new trigger\n\nI like the feel of the Reverb trigger better than the Revive/BikeYoke. It&apos;s not a big deal and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get used to it, but the way the dropper post engages feels slightly less responsive than the Reverb. With the hydraulic, as you push the trigger there&apos;s less resistance as the post releases. In contrast, the Revive trigger doesn&apos;t feel like it has a clear release point. I don&apos;t feel confident I&apos;ve pushed hard enough to drop the seat.\n\nI got the impression from my LBS that RockShock may be more amenable to repairing the Reverb. After a few months, my Reverb would get squishy and there wasn&apos;t a reliable way to fix it. I&apos;d push the bike shop to repair before speeding the $$ to switch it out.",

It is now April and I just now received a refund minus the shipping costs. I was told I wouldn&apos;t be charged shipping, but honestly, it&apos;s not worth my time being on hold for another hour and a half. They got me. Don&apos;t let them get you too. Go to a store and find a helmet. They will be new with a tag and you know it&apos;s the right color and fits well. Lesson learned.",

I went ahead and purchased smaller cheek pads and it&apos;s not quite as tight, but I wore it for 7 hours straight the first time w/the original pads and I was only starting to be a bit uncomfortable at the very end of the ride. So I imagine the tightness is a good thing in relation to protection. I live in Texas and have only worn it in the winter so far, so we&apos;ll have to see how well it breaths when I&apos;m riding in 100+ degree weather, but currently, it&apos;s well-ventilated. I feel like it would def do its job if I had a gnarly crash!!",

        "reviewBody": "The Coda has long been a high-level, cross-terrain performer. But the all-new Coda – designed with Pat Moore – breaks the evolutionary sound barrier with its forward-facing approach to all-mountain expectations. Its camber profile is supported by Grip Tech contact points to offer a unique combination of power and control. Its wider-platform tip and tail are designed to drive clean turns at high speeds through mixed conditions. And it&apos;s Mountain Twin design provides riders with the toolkit needed to get into and out of dicey spots. This is the next-gen Coda – and Pat Moore is putting his name and stamp of approval on it.",

        "reviewBody": "Patagonia does it again! This jacket has all the features I need for daily use, and is my new winter jacket (I live in the south so it doesn&apos;t get super cold). The fit is perfect and I can wear a thick sweater under it if I really want to, but it&apos;s so warm I normally don&apos;t need to. It&apos;s also breathable which is key for such a warm jacket, and it&apos;s water repellent, another key feature as we get more rain than snow where I live. It has three pockets making it easy to store things in the breast pocket leaving the waist pockets free for my hands to stay warm. And the hood provides full coverage without blocking my view or flopping all over the place. \r\nI highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, long lasting mid weight jacket that will provide cozy warmth for years (decades if it&apos;s like my other Patagonia products!)",

        "reviewBody": "The Nano Air is one of the most comfortable and versatile jackets out there! I wear it all the time because it is so soft, stretchy, and breathable yet warm. It is a great layering jacket in cold temps and is a great standalone jacket in chilly conditions or cold temps when on the move. I have a ton of Patagonia mid layers and jackets, so I’d rate this one in between the Down Sweater and R2 Tech Face in warmth and also is warmer than the Micropuff, Nano Puff, Nano Air Light Hybrid and R1/R1 Air/Crossstrata. The hood is thin enough to wear under a helmet but can also be worn over most helmets. The fit is slightly shorter with a trim regular fit. It isn’t too tight, but isn’t boxy or bulky. Flattering fit for sure. The stretchy hand pockets are also clutch! I love this jacket, live in it, and highly recommend it. I’m Backcountry’s Patagonia Ambassador and expert, so feel free to reach out to me on chat, call 801-204-4562 or email amcclary@backcountry.com if you have any questions on this or other Patagonia products.",

One or two straps had single hole failures, but we have tightened them down on trips to the beach and to major bike competitions VERY TIGHT.   I MUCH prefer these stretchy straps to the new ratchet straps which are a pain to use.  I wish they&apos;d go back to this design.  BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SCREAM FOR.  \n\nOn the other hand, when a non-strap related failure struck our old rack, Thule stood by it and replaced the whole thing with a brand new rack.

Unfortunately, after using it twice (correctly done so), one of the straps split. I guess I just expected better from this company. After all of these reviews, essentially stating the same thing, you’d think they’d figure out the problem and head back to the drawing boards. There has to be a better solution, especially since it’s a part that is most used. Is it to make it so we need to buy more? This just seems strange considering this is supposed to be a great company- I’d think they’d perfect their products since they are so specialized in what they manufacture. Just my two cents!",

This is something we can normally easily replace with spare parts. \nWhile bike rack straps are subject to wear and tear, and so are not generally covered under Thule&apos;s limited lifetime warranty, two uses is a bit short of a lifespan, so I&apos;m glad we were able to help out with some replacements under the Thule Guarantee. \nWe hope you enjoy lots of rides with your bike rack!"

Broken straps can sometimes be caused by over- or under-tightening them around bike frames. Under-tightening causes bikes to move around more than what is safely allowable and over-tightening can cause undue stress on the material. \n\nStraps should be snug over the bike, but not stretched to reach another hole.

I am amazed at how warm they are. My hands are actually sweating now in 20 degree weather. But I?m fine with that since they have removable liners that I can wash. The goat leather is very durable and hold up well on the bars, and the finger works great with the brake levers and shifter levers. I would recommend these to everyone who are looking for a WARM DURABLE pair of gloves for biking and snowboarding on the mountains.",

Also make sure you use the balm that comes with them or you?ll end up having to wait for the seams to dry to apply it like I did.  Measured between a 9 and 10 and the 10 fit great.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been wearing this model of the speedcross since they released the wide-width. The durability of the shoe has drastically decreased, and they still haven&apos;t made the shoes waterproof like the normal speedcross sizes. Why? I&apos;ve worn these shoes for trail running, peak bagging, and anything not on pavement. Generally I am pleased with the grip, fit, etc. Most recently I climbed a larger peak but nothing super technical, and my newest speedcross were about 2 weeks out of the box. The entire sole was ripped to shreds by the time I was back to the car. That&apos;s never happened before, but I was so disappointed. The talus wasn&apos;t anywhere near what I&apos;ve encountered while wearing prior versions of the shoe...so maybe it&apos;s just a lemon? Anyway. My husband has the speedcross as well, and it&apos;s annoying that he can do water crossings and not get his feet soaked, while I have almost the same shoe and my feet are soaked. That&apos;s probably my biggest complaint -- for the price and model they can&apos;t make the wide width waterproof?",

They remain comfortable and durable, with no holes around the toe areas or even any signs of wear.  My only issue is that the treads have worn off in spots and there are a few areas where there may be a hole starting on the bottoms.  From the top they look as good as when I started wearing them though, and that is pretty amazing.",

It’s a bit of a handful to set up but I’ve used one many times before so we knew what to do. It is ideal for a large party where weight isn’t an issue. \nI expect the stakes that come with it may be a little light in a real blow so I plan to add another bigger/heavier set. In the past we have found double staking some of the windward guy lines usually does the trick.",

This year he couldn?t make it and we expected rain for our pre season Main trip. Days before we ordered the Rendezvous.  \n\nIt was an amazing shelter that pitched quickly and added tons of space for shelter over the kitchen or a sitting place in the shade. We used oar handles to pitch it higher and the convenient pockets at each point made it easy to do so. \n\nThe system needed several of us to hold different poles or to get stakes in the ground. Would be a difficult job with one or two people. Would be great if it came with an extra stake. \n\nYears ago we bought a tent like sunshade but never took it anywhere because it was so heavy and hot and hard to set up. The Rendezvous packs small and will be with us on every trip.",

It is made of high quality material and can be configured into shapes and heights to fit your environmental conditions. It is not easy to set up with one person but if you have a group it goes up quickly. Reading other peoples reviews the common theme seems to be the stakes are inadequate and I would second that. To improvise I made 12 inch wooden sand stakes, once these are pounded into the sand the tarp is not moving even on windy days. Sand stakes were made on a table saw using some old wooden flooring.",

Teahouse rooms are unheated, and many are over 12,000&apos;. This warm, stretchy and comfortable liner helped keep my bag clean and me warm, the very few times I needed it for warmth.\n\nOnly 4 stars, because:\nMy StS bag has a separate zipper for the footbox, that I usually have open, even at high elevations and thought the liner would, too. I thought this because the pictures online (&amp; even the one StS attached to the email asking for this review), plus wording on the box state the bottom has a drawstring. It doesn&apos;t for the semi-rectangular version I needed. So, my dear spouse ripped the bottom open and sewed one in.\n\nStS did apologize for the incorrect wording on the package, and made it as right as they could.",

This design is superb with the option to cinch the feet and the snap buttons on top, really made it much user friendly for someone like me. This material is cooling, perfect for the upcoming summer camping. Super soft material, made it very easy to sleep in. Totally would recommend!",

        "reviewBody": "First of all, you NEED a liner for your sleeping bag. If you wash your bedding at home once a week—that being under ideal hygienic conditions where you shower every single day—you really don&apos;t want that funk getting into your expensive sleeping bag! That&apos;s where a liner really helps!\n\nThis liner is an upgrade for me. I&apos;ve been using a Sea-to-Summit Comfort Blend for several years, and I&apos;ve really liked that product a lot. But I thought a back-up liner might be nice. But I was really blown away with how nice the Breeze liner is! Mine is the regular Mummy style, and I really appreciate the soft, wicking material that the Breeze is constructed from. Apparently it&apos;s a similar material as the Tek towels (I think…maybe its one of the other towels?). I sleep hot, and I sweat a lot at night, so drawing that moisture off is a really nice feature. To help regulate my comfort (including at home) I usually stick my feet out of the end of the bed (and of the liner), so the opening at the bottom is actually a really welcome feature! Yeah…I don&apos;t wander the campsite in my liner, but I suppose you could if you wanted to. To each their own!\n\nAnyhow, I really love my new liner. What WAS going to be a spare is now my go-to!",

The snaps at the top mean you can have your arms free which is great for people who sleep with their hands behind or above their head. It is so easy to wash compared to a sleeping bag. I also have a Reactor liner and the Breeze liner is noticeably cooler to the touch. This is a great product for camping on warm summer nights!",

I had never thought of using a liner before being introduced to this product, but this is actually quite useful. As someone who tends to get hot quite easily, especially while sleeping, this felt great on the skin. As soon as you envelope yourself in this liner, you get a nice cooling effect. The material is soft, lightweight and allows for movement, which adds to a comfortable sleep. This liner is shaped nicely with a hood, arm holes and an open bottom, so you could just wear this out and pull up the bottom if you need to get out of your sleeping bag in the middle of the night, and therefore, not leave this to get tangled in the bottom of the bag or struggle to get comfortably around you. I did notice the cooling sensation wear off while I slept, but I did not wake up drenched in sweat or feel like I was overheating as I often do.  I hand washed this in cold and hung it to dry and it was dry within the day. I believe with proper care this will hold up nicely as long as you do not snag it. Also, this comes with a travel pouch and takes up very little space and would be easy to travel with. I&apos;m very pleased with this product and find it to be a useful solution to hot sleepers like myself.",

        "reviewBody": "For a more aggressive shoe, I find these to be on the more comfortable end. Laces and a flexible midsole both help on that front. It may not be my choice for outdoor projecting, but I love using them at the gym. No major complaints at the crag, I just have other shoes that can get the job done better. That isn&apos;t to say it&apos;s a bad shoe at all. I quite like these shoes even if they aren&apos;t the cutting edge of performance for me.\n\nMAKE SURE TO SIZE UP! Fortunately I had read some comments before buying my pair. I usually wear somewhere around a 37.5, but these barely fit at 38.5. Go AT LEAST one full size up from what you&apos;d typically buy unless you want to really squeeze those toes.",

Turns out, it&apos;s like two and a half sizes smaller than my Solution! Doesn&apos;t make any sense. Scarpa claims 39.0 is like a US Men&apos;s 6.5, but that&apos;s just not true.

I bought the G-Form Pro X-3 because they offered solid protection for most of the XC and trail riding I typically do. They fit well and stay in place on my arms without issue. I would definately buy them again when the time comes.",

When I ordered these I was concerned that they would be very uncomfortable but after several rides thes elbow pads stay put and I forget that I have them on. They evaporate moisture throughout the ride and stay cool after several hours of riding in the heat.\n\nThe Samrt Flex padding in the elbow and forearm area will give some minor protection to both impact and brushing off on thorny trees and bushes. \n\nThe size that I chose fit as the chart claimed. I have been very satisfied thus far and also have the G-Form Pro Guard Knee pads. I would recommend these to a friend.",
