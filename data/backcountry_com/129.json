I&apos;m a field scientist who has experimented with many brands of so-called high quality socks, and Darn Tough is the best. After buying several pairs in Adult Women&apos;s Medium sock size, I tried Junior Large to see if it works with my feet. (The Juniors are often significantly cheaper than the Adult socks.) It works great! My woman&apos;s shoe size is 7.5 (US) or 39 (EU), and my feet are slightly wider than normal. So if you are around this size, you too may find that Juniors work for you! ALSO, more information on this particular sock: It has a very modest cushioning effect. Not bulky. Good, uniform feel about the foot. Great for people who want some warmth/cushion without bulk.",

I wear an 8 in running sneakers so I was a bit hesitant but these fit like a charm.  Enough room in toe box.  Super cushion and support in the footbed.  Nice taupe color.  You really could wear these around town they have a nice stylish look.  Mostly for easy trails.  I also got a pair of the 600 brown suede which Is a bit more hefty for snow/stronger woodland hiking.  Very pleased!",

The main compartment can fit up to 4 laptops but you need to be careful with how you handle the bag as there isn&apos;t much bottom padding protection outside of the main laptop sleeve. (I&apos;m definitely using the bag outside of its means). \r\n\r\nThis slim profile backpack is amazing and hits everything I care about in an everyday carry bag. It isn&apos;t very light but it&apos;s extremely durable, well designed, and is extremely comfortable.\r\n\r\n2 minor issues that doesn&apos;t bother me too much (based off my rating) was:\r\n1.) the water bottle does hold a Nalegene (which is what I typically carry) but other style water bottles will be a bit loose and may fall out.\r\n2.) The &quot;sunglasses pocket&quot; is too shallow. I primarily only use it for charging cables and dongles. There is a lot of supplemental pockets to hold a more traditional sunglasses case.\r\n\r\nGreat backpack and worth the price in my opinion.",

It&apos;s also been good as a small day pack for outdoor climbing. The pockets are great for keeping my things organized and it fits comfortably, plus the water bottle holders are perfect for Nalgenes/similar. It holds about the right amount of stuff for work/travel/short day trips, but would probably be a little small for a bigger day hike (and has no hip strap). Overall so far it&apos;s been absolutely fantastic for everything I wanted to use it for! Only flaw is the velcro on the front, I wish it was magnets or snaps or even just a blank flap instead.",

Bottom line: I should have not have convinced myself that it would work for me and should have returned immediately.

Several open pockets that allow for relative ease of use. \r\n**I came to appreciate the hybrid half-zip/clam shell design of the main pocket. There are interior flaps that prevent the bag from opening completely but can be undone to allow a clam shell opening.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n**Front pocket is underdeveloped.  No admin pouch which I thought would not be an issue but quickly became one of my main irritants. No mesh pockets or pen holders. It does barely fit a Steam Deck and generic charger\r\n**Top pouch is extremely shallow to the point of being virtually useless. Not felt lined.\r\n**Laptop compartment is not suspended from the bottom\r\n**No strap keepers. Just an odd omission\r\n**Water bottle holders are technically made of a stretchy material but are unable to keep anything but the largest bottles in place.",

Watch the sizing...you want to get it right, so that the gear loops are in the right position. Though I fit a Medium (I&apos;m a 33 waist), the Large is better in terms of where the gear loops sit. Some day hopefully, BD will figure out how to make the straps at the back more robust...they are always the first thing that fails.",

Gear loops are easy to clip in, leg loops adjust to your legs due to the elastic band. It’s not constricting to wear and I love the color. The elastic band takes a beating when you rig up a third hand to a leg loop( I wouldn’t recommend doing that) overall this harness is great for sport climbing. I’m not sure if a small percentage of the proceeds go to the Honnold Foundation after purchase but, if it is, It’s for a good cause.",

We live in the PNW with lots of snow, rain, and mud. Outside of tromping through creeks the waterproofness holds up great. We still have rain boots for puddle jumping but for general hiking and keeping warm in the snow with some soggy bits in between these have been great! Our littlest pair have held up well enough we expect to be able to pass them down to a third user with no troubles.",

I love that I was able to find a size small tall in a color other than black (not sure if that&apos;s still the case, but please keep making tall sizes in fun colors, Outdoor Research). Love the drop seat - no problem using the facilities while in the backcountry. Light weight, nice amount of stretch. Love the beacon pocket and front pocket where I put my phone. Very glad for the scuff guards on the bottom of the pant legs - I would have shredded the inside cuff very quickly with both my ski and snowshoe edges. I&apos;m 5&apos;9&quot;, 145lbs with long legs, not much for hips, and 29&quot; poorly defined waist (ruler shaped) and I wear a small tall with comfortable room for a thin base layer bottoms, but I&apos;m definitely at the end range for that size.",

        "reviewBody": "Not sure what took me so long to switch to bibs for backcountry skiing. I think my greatest fear was how hard it would be to pee in them. Well, I find it easier than with pants! I tried it out at home to see what it required. The key is to pull the zipper all the way down. The improvements are you just pull the bibs across your bum and squat and there are no pants bunched up below and no peeing in your pants (yes, that has happened.) And it doesn&apos;t require a major squat to have them out of the way. Then, bonus two, when you are done and you stand up to zip up the bibs, your butt is covered, your front is covered, and you can casually pull up your undies! Just blown away at the improvement from pants. I love also that I can layer a couple pairs of long undies and have no constricting waistband. These bibs are thin but easy to layer. Love having my iPhone in that chest pocket. The only downside of the Carbide bibs is that they are too long by about three inches (I got a size large, 31.5 inseam which is my inseam) but I just roll them up when I take off my ski boots. Also the hand pockets are too deep and my beacon just sags low on my thigh which is a tad uncomfortable which is why I couldn&apos;t give them a five star rating. But wow, I&apos;m a convert. Love the Carbide Bibs!",

The right shoulder strap is sewn in a few centimeters further in than the other, resulting in an uneven fit. I reached out to customer service only to be told there is nothing they can do about the defective item they shipped me, and I can only return it. I am disappointed with the quality of the bibs and the lack support received from customer service regarding an issue out of my control.

Shifts are crisp and there is so hunting for gears in the middle of the cassette. The red is a fun color addition, but know that the piece that connects to the derailleur hanger is silver not a dark grey like it appears in photos. I recommend the X01 so far though I haven’t taken it on more than 1 ride so far. It is a significant upgrade from the NX lineup.",

        "reviewBody": "I’m a mountain guide and have been wearing shell jackets for over 50 years and this jacket is the best (and one of the most inexpensive) I’ve used. Because of the stretchiness of the material one can have a closer fit than with a conventional shell. Initially, I bought it too big and sent it back for a smaller size. I’ve used it in summer and for all my ski touring this winter, always with a rucksack and have no bobbling or signs of wear so I think that others who have this problem must have abrasive rucksack straps. Even with lots of layers underneath, including a duvet, it is still comfortable. Its lightness and packability are good for space in rucksack. I like the lack of rustling and flexibility. Hood is comfortable and spacious. It could do with an adjustment at the back of the hood to raise the peak for better visibility. Pockets are generous and work when wearing a harness and rucksack. It will be interesting to see how long it can continue to perform and see whether it can outlast goretex garments.",

As much as I didn&apos;t want to deal with laces, I would&apos;ve been ok to take the extra time to lace up. The reason I had to return these even on a great half off deal, is that it hurts to walk in! Very rigid on my shins every time I took a step. Maybe I had to break them in more-I actually never wore them outside. I tried to just break them in a little indoors. But upon much deliberation, I had to return. It didn&apos;t fit like a glove, and not comfy right off the bat as my current Teva De La Vina boots were that I&apos;ve had for 7 years, but sadly have worn out! Customer service was fantastic in that someone helped me out via phone call and helped set up the prepaid shipping label for me. I received the refund super quick as well! I wish Teva to make more casual boot options without laces! I love Teva!",

They took a lot longer to break in than other leather boots I&apos;ve had. In just the first month I had to wax the threads on the exterior seams because they were already starting to come undone. The threads are just too thin and fray easily. But the real issue is the back section behind the ball of the foot. While the front half has triple sewed seams, the back only is single sewed! Now, it appears like the back has two seams. But after the first seam came undone, it revealed that the second stich wasn&apos;t attached to the top piece! Now, I&apos;m pretty annoyed that the stitch came undone. I&apos;ve only had these about nine months, and I only use them in light duty applications. I don&apos;t use these to hike or work; just for regular walking around. I treat my shoes with a lot of respect, so I was shocked that these failed after less than a year! These don&apos;t even hold up to light daily use; they would not take any sort of actual boot use.",

I was looking for a boot that could do it all, from dressing up with a cute dress to going out to kicking around town in joggers to hiking and rain. These boots fit the bill! Much lighter and less clunky than my Docs. Easy side zip!!! And with several wears now, the leather is breaking in really nicely! I have wide feet, usually wear barefoot style shoes, and these have room in the toe box and the leather is adapting to my foot. Fit true to size. Love them for traveling because they&apos;re so versatile, so I just need these boots and a sandal for my whole trip. They&apos;ve excelled in Texas, Colorado, California, and Costa Rica so far! Highly recommended, just remember to wear them and break them in before doing a high-mileage jaunt. I put moleskin patches on my heels the first 2 or 3 wears, and now they&apos;re good and I don&apos;t need the patches anymore.",

        "reviewBody": "As a plus size person whose feet tend to retain water, it is very hard to find a good quality pair of hiking boots. Especially ones that go past the ankle. I want to thank everybody here that left the review saying stay true to your size and let them break in... Instead of sizing up. When I first put them on I was panicked, and thought I would have to return them. I had to widen the laces and let the middle part show more than it is in the picture. (But that also leaves a lot of room for adjustment and comfortability.) Seriously, Let. Them. Break. In. It took me about 4 days to break them in. And it&apos;s been about 2 weeks where I can just slide them on and walk like it&apos;s nothing. They are the most supportive, comfortable, well designed, and flexible boots I&apos;ve ever owned. I usually have to buy a wide boot but they are just wide enough. Wearing these boots in the garden, for nature walks, and even just to run errands, actually helps the swelling in my feet. They do show scuffs and marks easy but those usually fade and honestly they just look like a really nice well-worn hiking boot.. I don&apos;t have any issue with the aesthetic I&apos;m going for comfortable, durable, and practical. I&apos;m so happy with these boots that I&apos;d like to buy another but maybe save up for a different color. I personally can&apos;t recommend these enough, for all sizes but especially anyone who&apos;s plus size that really wants to go on hikes in the woods lol. Thank you Teva team, you set a high standard ☺️",

        "reviewBody": "Love the boots. Quick lace system is super convenient and they don’t loosen throughout the day. If you’re looking for support and responsiveness, the boots have them in spades. My only qualm is due to the design of the quick laces, the top portion of the boot doesn’t tighten as much as I would like. The lace system tightens the loop closest to the ankle first and by the time that tension has been wrapped in and out the boot a couple times and reaches the top, there’s not much left. The result is you end up getting a little play up high before your shin gets the boots to respond. The support is still really good, and once that shin hits, the boots respond. Wonder if burtons thought about adding one of those Velcro shin straps that deeluxe has been putting on their boots. Thinking of figuring one out myself. Anywho, good luck and happy hunting on the dreadful snowboard boot finding pilgrimage. 4.5/5 final rating",

This tape has good cushion but still allows a good feel on the bars while out of the saddle or while leaning into a corner. I like the fact that I can take it off and wash it and re-apply a couple of times during the season to get rid of the grime that builds up. Regardless, I still replace every spring and love the look and feel of new Lizard skin bar tape.",

        "reviewBody": "This extension is horrible and I struggle every time I use it.  It&apos;s heavy and hard to carry, but that&apos;s fine.  I&apos;ll assume that makes it more sturdy.  But there are 2 big issues.  The first is with attaching it.  You have to line it up just right so it connects to the handle.  This seems to get harder every time I attach it and it usually takes me over an hour to actually get it connected.  The 2nd big issue is that even when that&apos;s connected, it doesn&apos;t work right.  The handle feels like it jams and won&apos;t lift.  If my car is facing downhill it never works.  If the car is facing uphill or on flat ground it works sometimes.  If it doesn&apos;t work, I have to get a wrench and help guide it from the inside.  There are lots complaints about this if you look on any reviews.  You may be lucky and have your be fine.  It seems about 3 out of 4 of them are okay.  \n\nI&apos;ve had this rack 3 years now and only use it 2-3 times a year.  It&apos;s not as if it&apos;s old.  These are just issue due to poor design or manufacturing.  I&apos;ll also note that I had the older version of this rack about 15 years ago and it worked great.  But they seem to have complicated things with this design and there are now common issues with it.",

With the extension, the total rake height is quite high when vertical but I have not noticed a major hit to the mpg; and it is notably heavy. That said, it’s very sturdy and should hold up for years.",

Included illustrated instructions were very poor, had to rely on non-thule reviews to understand what thule was trying to show.. Rack functions on edge of performance window for two bikes, but with 2 bike extension, as reported in another review &quot;the handle doesn&apos;t work, even when connected correctly. I can use the handle to move the lock latch a bit, but not enough to toggle the lock. So I have to keep the rack in the down position full-time.&quot; Otherwise it is robust and excellent, especially without extension. Help Thule pls!!",

Could try and jerry rig it, but at this price point it should be an easy seamless experience to take on and off. If you can get this to work, you definitely would not be switching it back and forth from a 4 to 2-bike rack.",

          "Thank you for contacting Thule and sharing your feedback. \nI understand your frustration with the defective piece of your bike rack. A small production run of the Thule T2 Pro XTR had a mis-formed handle that can easily be replaced. I reached out via email to start that process and get the new handle shipped out. \nThe connection between the base bike rack and add-on needs to be strong and secure to support the additional weight of the add-on and mounted bikes. This can make the add-on difficult to remove, but ensures safe travels. Some lubrication like white lithium grease or spray silicone during installation can help the add-on slide into place and be more easily removed when needed."

        "reviewBody": "Pro: permanently changes your T2 Pro XT from 2-bike mode to 4-bike mode, if you need to transport 4 bikes.\r\n\r\nCon: as others have said, the manufacturing tolerances on this product are very poor, and this was one of the most difficult and frustrating product installations I&apos;ve ever done in my life.  That said, I was able to get it installed, but most people I know would not have been able to do it themselves.  \r\n\r\nThe add-on&apos;s steel frame would not slide nicely into the steel frame of the T2 Pro XT.  I had to use a 2x4 and a hammer to hammer it in place.  (Add-on was too large and the original unit&apos;s receiving hole was too small).  This makes it absolutely impossible to ever remove it without damaging, and it made the install very difficult. \r\n Then, the screw holes did not line up well, meaning I had to hammer the thing back and forth repeatedly just to get the screws to even be able to thread in.  Finally, for the mechanism that attaches to the handle, there are 2 blind screws inside deep holes, you have to stick your allen wrench in there and pray for screw engagement, there is no way to see anything.  You can&apos;t back out the screw at all.  That step alone took 30 minutes of jiggling, banging, cursing, etc, in order to get the screws to magically line up with their threaded holes.  The worst part?  If you fail at this step of installing the add-on kit, you won&apos;t be able to use the original bike rack anymore either because you have already detached these screws, and the mechanism won&apos;t work anymore.  \r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to get this installed at a professional bike shop where they do the hard work for you.  Only get this if you absolutely need 4 bikes on your already-owned T2 Pro XT.",

The difference is definitely appreciated and I don’t feel like it’s too low to be useful. Using more of the smaller cogs in back now too so sprockets should last a little longer. Classier look with the gold logos and sharper definition.",

This tent is also great - it kept us bone-dry in the rain, has a lot of space for the family and the dogs, was easy to put up, and was easy to put away.  The only issue I have is that the bar that supports the rain fly over the doors pulls the door so tight that the stitching was starting to pull out on the zipper on the first day of use.  Again, the tent is great otherwise, but will be disappointing if the door becomes unusable so soon.",

Having a spot to run an electrical cord in and plug in a fan and coffee pot is amazing. I’m taking off a star bc the zipper is super annoying. It’s constantly getting stuck and you can’t zip/unzip one handed. I still love the tent and would recommend to anyone. Putting it together definitely took more than 5 minutes the first time lol. But set up/take down is super easy-once you get the hang of it.",

The fit is trim looking while still not limiting mobility. The thicker material blocks the wind nicely and kept my legs on the hotter side of warm on a windy and cloudy 10 degree C day. The integrated belt provides great and comfortable adjustments while not adding any bulk under a harness. A few more increments would be amazing but that is a nitpick. Only con so far is that after three days of use one the pockets is starting to come unsewn. Should be an easy fix but shouldn&apos;t be happening this faster either. I am 180cm and 81kg. The 32in waist fit perfectly and the 30in inseam works great for over casual shoes and keeps the hem out of the way on the wall.",

The current fashion definition for Tech Pant is very wide and seems like it can be anything from dress pants, to chinos, to pants actually made for technical outdoor activities as long as they have some stretch material.  \r\n\r\nAs for the actual pants.  I really like the stretch canvas, and while the sizing does run large, I like the fit.  It is easy to move around in, and not at all constricting.  Other than the hidden pocket, which needs to be tacked down so I don&apos;t have to position it every time I pull the pants up.  It is a very solid everyday pant, but it will not be replacing my Fjallraven Keb trousers, or any of my other actual technical pants for demanding outdoor activies.",

I&apos;ve walked hundreds of miles on all types of terrain (cities, mountains, deserts, forests, I&apos;ve tried these everywhere) completely comfortably. They have not caused any blisters or other issues. I wore them on a couple of very rainy days and they dried out relatively quickly. I am now 6 months into owning them and I&apos;ve worn them A LOT and just the fabric on the heels is starting to wear out. All in all, very happy with them!",

I have high arches and bad knees and these boots provide a comfy sole without sacrificing stability. The leather and tread feel durable and the boots are all around well made. Happy to see Merrell has maintained quality while it seems like everything else is cheapening out. Highly recommend for causal day hiking!",

I think that everybody should have one of these in case of emergencies. It comes in a compact box and you can carry it anywhere. I’ll be in my car, especially since there are very heavy winters where I live. This includes a protection shelter, it’s lightweight, and holds heat and is also waterproof. It also has some other versatile features such as a rescue and a tinder cord. I feel safe having this on hand! For the price it’s a great item to keep your mind at ease in an emergency.\n\nRecommend to anyone, those who have a car should probably store one in case of an emergency and it really is so compact you barely notice!",

Hubby and I work remote and travel a lot, my Osito jacket comes on every trip! It is the perfect weight and form for everything you might encounter. Going to be warmer? well t-shirt underneath, unzipped and rolled up sleeves. Going to be colder? sweater underneath or coat over top. I have worn it everywhere from the Egyptian desert to the mountains of Japan, hiking and going to Yoga. I have worn everything from nothing underneath it (long story lol) to a full wet suit. It packs really well traveling because the fabric is very airy and compresses a lot. By the way my favorite thing is how soft the inside is, feels great against the skin!",

My street shoe sizes is 7.5 I own these in 39 and 39.5 Based on the size chart I should have 38.5 but it&apos;s too small and uncomfortable. 39 fits perfect and I wear them  in cooler ideal climates and 39.5 are a little loose which I wear in warmer temps when my feet are a little swollen from heat. I use these for all sport climbing, vertical and overhanging. I own the women&apos;s version as well and don&apos;t really notice the difference.",

They can even hold their own on the slab. However, I have a couple complaints about this shoe. The main issue is, after 2+ hours of use a huge blister forms on my big toe. Taping my toe doesn&apos;t seem to help it at all. However, this could just be a me thing, so this might not apply to you. Also, the break-in period was the worst break-in period i&apos;ve ever had. These HURT for the first few weeks. However, they now feel great.",

        "reviewBody": "We all are on a journey to find the Holy Grail of climbing shoes, meaning a shoe that enables us to climb better and achieve at levels we have hoped for.  For me, that journey led me to try the Solution.  After a brief break in period, they are really my favorite climbing shoes and enable me to climb 1-2 grades higher than before, plus get into bouldering in an enjoyable fashion.  Funny, I ran into a young lady at the local gym that was about to order her 4th, yes 4th, simultaneous pair of Solutions!!  I don&apos;t know why she thinks she needs that many pairs at the same time; but I&apos;m sure her Gearhead at Backcountry loves her, because she says  she gets all her gear here.  Inspired by her, I got a 2nd pair up 1/2 size to use when I&apos;d like to keep my shoes on for more than one pitch and don&apos;t need the last scintilla of performance I can get with the tighter size on.  \nPOSTSCRIPT:  Bizarre: One year later, my feet have grown a full size; so now I have a pair of these Solutions in 46 and a pair of the Solution Competitions in 45.5.  I wear these Solutions 75% of the time and go down to the Solution Comps when I am trying a route or project that requires more precision.  I just think these shows are incredible!!!",

First impressions is that the number of pockets and their positioning is exactly the type of thing you didn&apos;t know you needed until you have it. Feels light and offers good maneuverability. Just roomy enough that layering with mid layer doesn&apos;t feel bulky and stuffed. Although the armpit area is a bit snug, I have a Denali fleece so maybe the newer FutureFleece models will fit better. I have high hopes this jacket will hold up for years snowboarding here on our icy slopes. I&apos;m already liking the tech designed into this jacket.",

I was looking at more traditional chest harnesses for SRT, but when I saw this one from Black Diamond, the additional gear attachments points and ease of adjustability drew my attention. I was skeptical to give it a shot, but decided to try it. I am happy to say this is my new favorite chest harness!! Super comfortable and adjustable. Love the added gear loops for radios, etc. Having a more secure and convenient radio attachment point will hopefully prevent radio #3 from taking a 125+ plunge down a pit.",

The dual adjustment straps on either side of the tie point work very well. The only downside I see is if you were to remove the harness while racked (say, at a belay and swapping leads) it will be tough to get out of since you slide this harness over your head. It would be nice to have an opening up front to ease this move or else plan on reracking on another harness/sling for a lead swap.",

However, I&apos;m on my second jacket and both times, within 1 season of wearing it, the material on the inner neck has started to pull and wear.

        "reviewBody": "After losing a lot of weight and never really having a nice jacket, I decided I would finally make an meaningful investment for this winter - and many more winters to come. I was shocked and impressed at the light weight of the jacket. The insulating properties are average for this type of jacket. I live in Florida. However. during the winter, our temperatures at night can easily and consistently be 30 and 40 degrees F, in January (about 0 - 4 C, for the rest of the world that uses &apos;science numbers&apos;). If active, per the temperatures I listed above, no layering may be needed. Though, I typically wear a shirt and then my HH fleece at the mid layer, for this mid-layer jacket.\n\n My only two gripes are minor in nature. The sleeves tend to be about 25mm too long. However, maybe by design this is intended. I am not sure. When I wear one or two items below the jacket, the extra length of the arms is no longer an issue. Without the extra layers, the sleeves almost roll into the base of my palms. This can be dangerous in certain applications. My last gripe - and the most annoying thing - about the jacket is the YKK zipper. I&apos;ve used YKK zippers in this past. This is consistently the worst experience with a &apos;quality&apos; zipper I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s extremely hit-or-miss, per se. The male-end of the sipper simply will not align into the open ends of the two zippers, sometimes. I can literally try ten times to create proper alignment for zipping. Other times, I can align the male-end to the open sides of the zipper with no isssue(s). But at least eighty percent of the time, I am spending at least twenty or thirty seconds to properly align all the elements to crate a successful zipping pattern. \n\nDespite those issues, this is almost the best jacket I have purchased. Below,\n\nI&apos;m 5&apos; 6&apos;&apos; / 168 cm.\nWeight is 145 pounds / 65.7 kg\nWaist is 29&apos;&apos; / 73.6 cm\nChest is 36&apos;&apos; / 91.4 cm",

I still kept it as it&apos;s comfortable and warm, needs to be broken in a bit to be less stiff. True to size too which is good since my experience has been some Kuhl tops can run small but this fits well.",

Great quality too, as usual for Kuhl.\nI do wish it had a waist cinch to adjust for a more fitted look and cosy effect - and as usual for my large head, I wish it had a roomier hood and collar. I don&apos;t quite love the gathered wrists either. I&apos;m keeping it though!\nFor reference, a small fits with a comfortable amount of room for a thick hoodie underneath and I&apos;m just over 120 pounds, 5&apos;7&quot;.",

However,  it is  very soft on the outside (unlike many of the other similar jackets)  and  very soft and cuddly on the inside.  I know this is going to be my new favorite jacket.    I got in the blue color and it is a very pretty shade of blue.  Also,  in this color can be used for cool summer nights without looking like you have a fall or winter jacket on.    The styling is super cute, and it runs true to size.   I am usually an xs in khul fleeces and jackets, and the xsmall fit me well,  enough room to layer underneath but not looking sloppy.     I am 5&apos;,  105 lbs,  34c, and 37.5 hips.    I had also purchased the small, but sent it back because it was way too big.",

The only problem is the lowest setting is still too high for her. I personally like the way it feels on my shoulders at a higher setting. So for me love it but mom not so much. My only complaint and why it doesn&apos;t get 5 stars is the charger. It comes with the cord but not the part that plugs into the wall. It doesn&apos;t have a usb end so I can&apos;t use the power box things I already have around the house. So I have to go buy something just to charge it. I think this company can do better especially since the product cost so much!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought one of these totes on a whim to see if it would work for camping gear, and now I own four of them. This thing is incredibly versatile! It fits perfectly in the top tier of a mini grocery cart so no more plastic bags. Trips to the bike park are a breeze since this thing holds 2 full-face helmets and chest protectors. Don&apos;t even get me started on all the uses for camping and the dog cause this will just turn into an editorial. My only wish is that there were more colors so that I could color-code uses. But alas, these will still be my go-to gift for the forseable future because everyone needs one in their life!",

        "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t sure about the kinda awkward square shape of this bag when I first got it, but turns out to be super functional! The large square bottom (that&apos;s a 15&quot; PC in the pic) makes it be squat to be able to carry bulkier gear in a lower Volume bag, which I think is super handy. This ended up being the perfect laundry bag for me out of happenstance (I was at the laundromat, the bag was empty in my truck...).  I was able to load it up easily with folded pants / shirts / skivvies...typical laundry items...but it made it so much easier to transport and keep my things organized. Someone said the sides collapse, I did not find that to be the case on the bumpy ride back to my camp. I am also appreciating all the features like the handle on the sides to be able to pull it out of tight spaces. It is currently residing under my bed, where I used to keep an awkward mesh laundry bag, but the squatness and squareness of it help it fit perfectly under my bed and easy to pull out for laundry days. And the material is so easy to clean! Perfect for that dirtbag lifestyle. It would also make a really good climbing gym bag with that wide opening.  I&apos;m so in love with this bag I think I&apos;ll get a second for the originally intended purpose I had when I bought the bag - hauling gear.",

The colors are amazing &amp; the fit is great too. Ariat is my go to brand for boots 👢 now.  13 pairs is a bit of an overkill or obsession. But I love wearing them and a girl has to have a different pair for whatever outfit she’s wearing.",

I currently own a pair of HERITAGE R TOE WESTERN BOOT in 8.5 C Wide, that fit perfectly, so ordered the same size in these!. They were way too tight, so exchanged for next size up 9 C Wide, which were also too short! I placed the size 9 C Wide in these next to the boots I have and they are visually at least an inch shorter. I have not tried to go another size up. If you have wide feet, I would go a whole size up in these!",

        "reviewBody": "No question these are the most versatile goggles on the market. Toric and cylindrical lenses are options, the field of view is solid, and the lens change system is unrivaled. The Perceive lenses add contrast and detail in bright and low light.\n\nFor flaws, on two different lenses there was internal fogging in the top right corner to start, and one situation became significant condensation inside the lens. The MFI mask is way thick and I found it hard to breath in, in addition to just adding lots of bulk around the neck which interfered with zipping up layers.\n\nLastly these are pretty big googles, so they aren&apos;t for all face sizes, but thus far they&apos;ve paired up with several helmets without issue.\n\nOverall really good, maybe great, but there&apos;s compromises.",

        "reviewBody": "And time you feel like you have compromised on a pack, it&apos;s never a good thing. I have used this several times now, on shorter and longer trips. \n\nPROS: I like having a brain, and compared to most ultra-light/light packs, this has one; this is the biggest plus. It&apos;s lightweight. It has an adjustable torso. The front pouch is deep. The price is ok for a light pack based on others like Hyperlite, Zpak, or Outdoor Vitals. \n\nCONS: It&apos;s not waterproof or even water-resistant; pack liner and pack cover required. As in many other reviews, water access from the sides is horrendous. A bladder is needed otherwise anytime you want water, the pack has to come off, or alternatively just wait for one of your bottles to fall out as you are moving down the trail. I ended up doing a DIY cut and re-attachment of one side mesh for better water access. The mesh material on the side pockets is not durable. There are few attachment points on the shoulder straps for hooking e.g. sunglasses or GPS. It&apos;s not a comfortable carry for a load beyond 25lbs; the shoulder straps start to dig in and I feel like I am constantly adjusting hip and shoulder straps for comfort. Sometimes the torso adjustment hooks will come undone (not during carry though). The pockets on the hip belt are small and the one that doesn&apos;t zip up is not at all useful given small size and that it doesn&apos;t seal. As others have said, the side compression straps awkwardly fit across over the side pockets. \n\nCONCLUSION: I haven&apos;t owned anything from Osprey before and, based on my experience with this pack, I will never purchase Osprey again. The pack feels like it was not carefully developed nor totally tested– and generally it feels like there was a kind of lack of ‘passion’ that went into its development.… maybe that’s unfair. But I don’t get excited packing up my stuff … there is no thrill (maybe it’s the drab colors), and more a sense of concern about how unconformable I will be. Though this is not up there in terms of price point like Hyperlite or Zpaks (which I think will be my next bag), like any pack it’s still an investment and IMHO this Osprey is not worth the money. Spend the extra to get a light pack where the designers really thought and cared about the details.",

Both really hurt, damage my lumbar region. \nFor a few more grams and load lifters eja solve health problems for me. Gotta keep wt OFF lower back. The Eja has a\nLW frame and Load Lifters, making the fit better for me. Does not hang or hurt shoulders, pack also has place for internal water bladdy. eja Keeps pack off lower back.

        "reviewBody": "Osprey decided to discontinue it&apos;s high-accolades winning Lumina pack (for reasons I still can&apos;t fathom), so I purchased what I thought would be Osprey&apos;s best replacement. The Eja Pro drew my attention since it is such a lightweight pack at 2 lbs and 55L capacity for the M/L. After trying many other ultralight packs, I always come back to what I consider to be Osprey&apos;s superior Airspeed suspension system. My expectations for the Eja Pro were high given my extremely successful, long-term relationship with the Lumina (over 3,000 miles of backpacking). Those expectations may taint my review, but break-ups are hard and rebound relationships are, well, reboundy, but let&apos;s dig in: Pros: comfy carry at 25lb load; sturdy fabric; side pockets well angled for access while pack is on; very lightweight; dreamy suspension system; great price Cons: First impression is bad color choice (sorry, but weathered asphalt and bloody bandages are what I immediately thought of....) The main compartment is narrow and difficult to load (compared to Lumina). Hello Barbie? Osprey stole your hip-belt pocket...as in, the right zippered hip-belt pocket is a useless, teeny-tiny size, which to me reads: &quot;&quot;not worth the weight.&quot;&quot; Full disclosure: I always wear a fanny pack, since it allows me to keep valuables with me even when my pack is off, so, for me, any hip-belt pockets are kinda useless. The toggles that are used to adjust the frame size irritatingly keep popping out of the holes when I take the pack on and off. Bigger toggles and smaller holes = better design choice. NO attachment straps on shoulder straps?! ACK, WHY?! Lastly, side compression straps OVER the side pockets make it difficult to get gear out without loosening straps, so getting water bottle/rain gear out while wearing the pack is impossible. Also, ACK, WHY?! Still pining for my Lumina, which will forever be known as my first love.",

The sizing is off. every SWool baselayer, shirt, hoody, sweater, jacket and multiples of many of them, this piece is the only one that runs way to small for me in med, to contrast it I had tried a large which was to large.(this happened with another SW baselayer 100% merino crew.) It also is so itchy I can&apos;t wear it next to my skin, an issue I have not experienced before with SW. I also purchased an Intraknit 1/2 zip hoody, medium, it fits great and is comfortable. So the Intaknit crew goes back as a fail.",

I simply swapped out the cleats over the same spot and with the same orientation as the old ones, and I found that it wasn&apos;t exactly the same position. Stupid me, I did a 50 mile ride the day I switched the cleats out, and I ended up with knee pain. :-( So re-adjustments are needed.\n\nOtherwise, everything is good.",

After a single hike, I noticed that the shoes were covered in dirt that I am unable to remove, despite repeated cleaning attempts. Additionally, there are black marks on the shoes that have become permanent and cannot be eliminated.\r\n\r\nGiven Salomon&apos;s reputation for high-quality outdoor gear, I am deeply disappointed by this experience. I hope you will consider my concerns seriously and provide an appropriate solution, such as approving a quality check and possible replacement of these shoes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\r\n\r\nmik",

These shoes are tighter around the top of the toes/forefoot and sides of the heel comparatively to the normal shamans. The LV versions go off women sizes so keep that in mind when buying from Backcountry. I got these LV ones in 11.5 US which is the same length from heel to toe compared to my Yellow/Black shamans 10.5 US.",

The Evolv Shaman seemed promising with its promise of a generous toe box and all-rounder performance. The toe box delivers, it’s very comfortable. Unfortunately, there’s something weird about the heel cup, it feels like it has lumps in it where the fabric pull tab is connected to the heel under the fabric and it digs into my heels in the most aggravating way. \n\nIn terms of sizing, I am always a size 37 in La Sportiva.

My choice of wading has always been a Simms guide boot, because there is no room for compromise. \nThe G4 with Powerlock cleats is a superstar. Everything about this boot is state of the art! \nThe G4 gives you the confidence to focus on the fishing. It provides a sole that allows you to wade slick freestone rivers and high country streams. The ankle support is noteworthy and appropriate. All while providing supreme comfort. \nI’m pleased with this boot because it so well thought out and designed. \nIt gives you a boot that allows you to get to that spot where you can deliver a Caddis to the rising rainbow…After all, in the water your choice of your boots matters a lot!",

The TPR cleat did a great on the snotty and slick rocks and the ankle support was amazing! \nI fished 40 days straight with them and they held up to all the abuse that I threw at them. \nIf you are looking are looking for a one quiver, do it all wading boot these are the ones you want to buy!",

I find my hands get colder now in the winter than they did before. I like that these gloves are water and windproof, and some insulation for warmth. I also really like the fact that they have leather to increase their ruggedness.",

It handles technical terrain well, and the cushioning provides a good balance of comfort and stability, even on longer runs. The shoe feels durable and reliable, which is exactly what you’d expect from Salomon.\r\n\r\nThat said, I wish the shoe had a bit more heel-to-toe drop. Additionally, the toe box feels a little too wide for my preference; a slightly narrower fit would give me a more secure and precise feel on technical trails.\r\n\r\nOverall, it’s a solid shoe that I enjoy, but these tweaks could make it even better for runners who prefer a snugger fit and more drop.",

Did a short run in the office and warehouse and my knees were hurting! I did return the shoes as I am an &quot;heel touch the ground first&quot; runner where a greater drop (like the speedcross 6) is required.\r\n\r\nI suggest Salomon makes it more clear on their website that this has a low drop!\r\n\r\nDon&apos;t worry, I will keep buying Speedcross but just not the Thundercross",

This Gore version runs narrower and a bit shorter than the non-Gore and they are too firm and tiring underfoot. I also wear various road and trail runners from Salomon and these are in comparison narrower. Just to &quot;synthetic&quot; and stiff feeling. The upper part of the tongue needs help as well, to much &quot;stuff&quot; sticking out that doesn&apos;t get tucked in when lacing the shoe which makes for more debris getting into shoe. Tongue could be more like the XT-6. Just my opinion, but putting these to the back of the closet.",

        "reviewBody": "The X Ultra 4GTX has never disappointed. I’ve had several pairs, low and mid. Hiking is a regular activity for me. The gore Tex seal keeps the water out, great support in the shoe and your foot is well protected from roots, toe stubs and rocks. I’ve found the traction to be excellent. The shoe is a bit narrow which is something to be aware of. I have a narrow foot and a high arch and the fit works very well for me. I’ve come to like the speed lacing after not being sure about it. After a hike it is great to release the speed lace toggle but still be able to walk efficiently with the loosened shoes without laces in the way and the shoe being too loose. Please keep this style in place as it is!",

I cannot say anywhere near the same about their competitors.  I hiked 15 miles out of the box with both my pairs of Solomons and absolutely no problems!

Pros: the material is lightweight, feels durable and excellent quality. There are lots of pockets and compartments for organizing. It holds a lot of stuff. Cons: it&apos;s a large shape &amp; size that&apos;s awkward to wear on a person who isn&apos;t very tall. It wouldn&apos;t work easily on public transit but would be fine for air travel.",

I travel often for work and tested the Subterra 2 by transferring the entire contents from my carryon roller suitcase.  Everything fit perfectly and the soft sides allowed for it to be compressed a bit more easily in the overhead compartment of the plane.  It is a bit bulky as a backpack, but I would easily be able to fit 2 weeks worth of travel gear so worth it to me.",

Fit was good, toe box was perfect and I loved how secure I felt walking in them.\nI wore them to my mailbox and the elastic was so tight &amp; scratchy it irritated my ankle and calf and left an abrasion. Also, the area where the elastic meets the leather seem rubbed against my ankles to the point it was painful with low cut socks. Wore taller socks and it was better, but I wanted to slip these on with or without socks. \nWanted to love these but returned and will look for a pair without the scratchy elastic.",

I will say I wish the style was slightly more sleek/dressy but I also think that is hard to find with waterproof shoes. However, overall I am obsessed and glad I ordered even though I have wide feet as I didn&apos;t find that they are narrow at all. Just a heads up, the shoe insert almost blends in when you buy so make sure to take that out and they&apos;ll be perfect!",

I had bought an XS Whirlibird IV to match my daughters which ran small so I ordered this as a replacement. Since the other ran small, I ordered the Forbidden Peak in a Small. It&apos;s pretty huge. The width of the arms fits but the sleeves, lining with extendable cuff with thumb loop and the length were way too long. My fingertips came to a 1/2&quot; shy of the end of the sleeve/cuff. Hopefully an XS will fit better. It&apos;d be great if Columbia was more consistent in their sizing. \r\n\r\nThe Pros: ALL of it! The Omni-Heat reflective interior does its job like nothing else on the market. The arm holes provide excellent ventilation when needed. The pockets are uber deep and plentiful.",

For my everyday I enjoy wearing boxers instead and figured these would be a great option.  I have been wearing them now for 4 months and have gotten to the point where I avoid wearing them whenever I can.  They do not fit at all like boxers, they fit more like boxer briefs, and they constantly get bunched up.  The material itself is really nice but I am very disappointed in the overall fit of the boxers.",

They are long, go over my jacket sleeves and keep the snow from getting inside. The liners stay in place, attached by Velcro without any interference. I give the 4 star when I use them while skiing because of the inability to grip objects, like ski poles. I have used them four times so far and hope they soften a bit more with use.

I have always had to add hand warmer packets to my mitts no matter who made them except for these ones. I am not even ordering a case of hand warmer packets like I do every year as I do not need them for these mitts. I had the best test with them this weekend -30 with wind chill and my hands were toasty for the first time ever! Thank you Outdoor Research for making these. I get no bonuses absolutely nothing for saying any of this other than I want the world to know, as I know what the struggle is like finding mitts that work. If I could give them 1000 ⭐️&apos;S I would. I work with a lot of clients and normally I am not the person to endorse anything but these I can&apos;t be quiet about them.",
