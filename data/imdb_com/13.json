      "reviewBody": "(2000) When The Sky Falls THRILLER/ DRAMA\n\nInitially a made-for-TV movie, now available on DVD starring Joan Allen as Irish crime-investigating reporter Sinead Hamilton, investigating the death of a person named Martin Shaughnessy, and his connection to the IRA as well as other unethical practices regarding drugs being sold to minor children. Although, it&apos;s based on an actual person, at least 75% of the movie has been fabricated, particularly the scenes how some of Dublin&apos;s police are being treated by the criminal public. In this movie, people can be assaulted and still get away with it, since it&apos;s the ridiculous my-word-against-yours sort of thing. And women are allowed to get assaulted by men with criminal records for trespassing, for the movie is so ludicrous, we don&apos;t even get to witness the court proceedings about how some people are able to get away from it- only that they&apos;re able to beat the system. If it wasn&apos;t for Joan Allen&apos;s acting this movie would&apos;ve been too unbearable to watch.",

But I enjoyed Part 2&apos;s focus on the wife of US Commander Dirk Lang, played by Gabriella, suffering back home in a porno version of the recent TV series The Astronaut Wives club.\n\nOther highlights include the 6-person orgy in space; a hot lesbian segment of girls cavorting in a sauna; and a cliffhanger ending when Lang arriving on the surface of Uranus meets two blue-skinned female creatures, who blow him memorably.\n\nIt&apos;s well worth watching all 3 parts together, though Part 1 has been cannibalized into that composite 2009 edition marked above. It&apos;s the segment which contains the brief but impressive &quot;weightless cum shot&quot;."

The verbal communication is 100% authentic, as is the pace of the film. It doesn&apos;t surprise me that all the reviewers don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; this movie. I applaud the makers of this remarkable film for its complete honesty and accuracy. I don&apos;t know how they achieved the subtleties in this portrayal unless they had spent a great deal of time there. Seeing the film put me right back there. In fact I think much of it was shot near my Rancho. It makes me long to go back and be with my Raramuri friends but watching it is just like being there. This film is a look into Raramuri life without any agenda on the part of the filmmakers. Absolutely wonderful!",

      "reviewBody": "Fontaine&apos;s new film seems on the surface simply a brightly colored Riviera toy, a romantic comedy with some Chabrol-eque twists at the end. There&apos;s a bit more; the salt-and-pepper casting of Fabrice Lucchini and Roschdy Zem is at least meant to be sly, the use of newcomer Louise Bourgoin an amusing experiment. Since this is Anne Fontaine, the comedy-drama is also a study of unexpected sexual attractions. It&apos;s a somewhat bizarre threesome: a famous lawyer, Bertrand (the soft, mercurial, witty Lucchini); his assigned and initially unwanted security guard, Christophe (the chiseled, tight-lipped Zim); and an air-headed but voluptuous TV weather bunny, Audrey (Bourgoin, a m√©teo presenter and TV personality in real life). But if the approach and the thinking are individual, the result is still pretty bland and generic.\n\nBertrand is a crack trial lawyer--and that&apos;s an excellent role for the ultra-articulate Lucchini. He&apos;s engaged in a high-profile trial in Monaco in which he is defending a posh lady, √âdith Lassalle (a rather wasted Stephane Audran) who murdered, by stabbing, her younger Russian boyfriend, a gigolo characterized in court as having been spectacularly well hung. The family&apos;s rich, the case is high profile, and the boyfriend was a a sleazy, possibly mafioso Russian, so √âdith&apos;s son Louis (Gilles Cohen) has engaged a full-time bodyguard for Bertrand.\n\nHe, Christophe, maintains his distance, but the clich√© happens: Bertrand notices him and, not to be bothered by his hovering, invites him to dinner. There not being any real physical danger anyway, Chirstophe soon becomes simply Bertrand&apos;s girl wrangler, disposing of an annoying ex-girlfriend of the lawyer (Jeanne Balibar) by bedding her, then keeping Audrey at bay when she begins seducing the lawyer in the middle of the trial. The surprise (but isn&apos;t it another comedy clich√©?) is, Christophe and Audrey have a history. Why not? She&apos;s screwed everyone on &apos;The Rock.&apos; He pretends to be the strong silent type, but the new Bertrand-Audrey story complicates the buddy-picture aspect of things by making Christophe both more personally protective of Bertrand and dangerously jealous of him, when this strong silent type turns out not to have gotten that girl out of his system. Christophe reacts with repressed rage toward Audrey, and the film turns strangely serious. But not serious enough to make an impression. And the comedy wasn&apos;t funny enough to be memorable either. The screenplay might have worked better if Fontaine had chosen one direction or the other and flown with it.\n\nSure, this is a good cast and the colorful, free Monagasque atmosphere is made integral to the action. But truth to tell Bourgoin is just a tasty bauble who&apos;s not drop-dead gorgeous or soulful enough to have a great future ahead of her. Whatever they may have thought, Bardot she&apos;s not. Fontaine&apos;s strict directing of Lucchini (who is far wittier and funnier on TV and probably in his stage performances) and Zem (whose role remains relatively servile here), holding both back from &quot;doing&quot; much, or being fully themselves, fails to make the most of either. Lucchini is always fun to watch (and to hear talk) but he&apos;s more fun to watch when he&apos;s just being himself. It&apos;s obvious that a Chabrol treatment of this theme would be better and his recent &apos;Girl Cut in Two&apos; has more depth--without having much depth.\n\nUltimately, and, alas, well before the last scene, this is a movie that disappoints. Will Sloan wasn&apos;t far from the mark when he commented that this illustrates Matt Groening&apos;s notion of &quot;cinema&apos;s greatest paradox,&quot; that &quot;the French are funny, sex is funny, and comedies are funny, yet no French sex comedies are funny.&quot; It&apos;s true of this one at least. A perusal of &apos;How I Killed My Father&apos; and the less often mentioned but intriguing &apos;Dry Cleaning&apos; will show how far this piece of frippery is from Anne Fontaine&apos;s best work.\n\n&apos;La fille de Monaco&apos; debuted in Paris August 20, 2008, to satisfactory reviews. Shown as part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, March 2009. It has been bought for distribution by Magnolia Pictures for an early July US release. with US release planned for early July. 2009",

However, I thought that a) Brock Pierce did a wonderful job, b) I could deduce some messages of life, c) the plot was nice and d) the interaction between Sinbad and Brock was rather substantial and well staged. Brock Pierce showed how lonesome and frustrating the life as the &quot;First Kid&quot; can be, how isolated he is and how much he suffers from this isolation. Sinbad - I mean, he is a clumsy guy, but he did fine in here. I never thought that he was constrained or fake. The movie as a whole lacks a realistic storyline, but that didn&apos;t matter to me. I was rather attracted by the scene in which Brock told him amid tears how outcast he felt, and I thought it was witty how Sinbad showed him what to do about it. Definitely not a masterpiece but surely above the average.",

The difference is the former two didn&apos;t take themselves too seriously and it seemed they were made with more care than this.\n\nGrowth starts out with an interesting premise, and actually very good dialogue and characters. Unfortunately, the story and editing made me sorry I got my hopes up at all. First of all, the film takes itself deadly seriously, and suffers for it. Not that I wanted a horror/comedy, but the script just couldn&apos;t pull off a straight horror story, alas.\n\nThe other main complaints with the film are as previously mentioned, characters make bizarre decisions beyond the typical &quot;stupid horror character decisions&quot; and are not explained. The effects of the parasites are too amorphous: do they affect the will of the victim? And the weak story too heavily relies on flashbacks.\n\nOn the positives, I actually thought the CGI was decently well done, the dialogue/script believable and the casting was not objectionable.\n\nI can see the director doesn&apos;t have much experience, so team him up with a better story editor and I&apos;d see the next one.",

It&apos;s not hilarious but it does feel campy. It also alternates with some action thrills. There is a great chase section in the Kasbah. I can do without the excessive exposition dump near the end. It went on and on and on. I do wonder if the exposition dump is another attempt at spoof humor. Again, I think it is but I&apos;m not sure.",

Although she does not know well how to handle this boat, and certainly has not enough money to maintain it, she decides to keep it.\n\nThis film tells about all problems &amp; complications following her decision. Including relations to several men, who are reluctant to get financially dragged down by her.\n\nThe female lead is performed by Christina Powileit, a drummer in an East German female rock band. Christina does not convince as a scientist in a literature institute -- thus making a significant weak spot in this film.\n\nDirector Herrmann Zschoche admits that he has done better in other films.

It was inevitable that following the success of a &quot;Look Who Is Talking&quot; that a sequel would follow. It was also inevitable that the sequel would be of inferior quality. \n\nPlot in A Paragraph: Mollie (Kirstie Alley) and James (John Travolta) are together and raising a family, which now consists of an older Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) and his baby sister, Julie (Roseanne Barr)\n\nAll the charm of the original movie is missing, what made the first movie so good was it was new, fresh and original. This is more of the same but without the originality, freshness, and newness. Instead it has Roseanne Barr. \n\nMy God, her voice is annoying!! The script is weak, Travolta and Alley do not enjoy the same chemistry as in the first movie (which is a shame) Bruce Willis remains fun, but that is about it!!",

      "reviewBody": "This 2013 scandanavian sci-fi film centers on Robert Nord, a formerly powerless man in an unsatisfying life, who discovers the exact frequency needed to control people&apos;s minds. He can give orders to their subconscious, from what to do to how to feel and what they even notice. Testing this out on his neighbors, he continuously experiments with this new power, while also using it to deflect law enforcement and a man who wants to know the secret for himself.\n\nThe story is told in a non linear fashion, with scenes often put out of order, to where we&apos;ll see something begin but cut away and go to another part of the story, before we see it&apos;s result later on. Don&apos;t be scared off by this, however. The film is easy to follow, you simply need to pay attention. In addition, the film is very cold and distant, using none of the usual techniques to manipulate audience reaction, but simply allowing things to play out. This works well for the dry sense of humor the film has, much of it centered around how both dark and absurd Robert&apos;s experiments become, which needless to say fall very short of what most rational people would consider moral. The only judgements made, however, are by the audience alone. However even with his immoral action, it&apos;s easy to feel some slight sympathy for Robert, a mentally ill, somewhat pathetic individual who at times seems to have his heart in the right place, but whose actions never lead to consequences good for anyone, not even himself. LFO: The movie finds that perfect balance, between conveying the philosophical quandaries of it&apos;s subject matter as well as the innate comedy of it, which come together especially perfectly in the film&apos;s conclusion.\n\nI don&apos;t want to say too much more, because it&apos;s better to go into this knowing very little. If what I wrote sounds even a little intriguing to you, chances are this film is right up your alley and you should seek it out immediately.",

      "reviewBody": "A View To A Kill seems to get more than its fair share of criticism. Often it is labelled the weakest of the Bond entries, but I don&apos;t think this is particularly true. Personally, I don&apos;t even rate it as the poorest of Roger Moore&apos;s Bond outings, with Moonraker and The Man With the Golden Gun standing out in my memeory as less memorable escapades than this one.\n\nIt&apos;s Moore&apos;s final appearance as 007, and he is trying to prevent a psychotic business magnate, Max Zorin (Walken) from destroying Silicon Valley and cornering the world electronic market all for himself. To make matters worse, Zorin is not your average adversary, since he was born as the result of a Nazi doctor&apos;s scientific tamperings resulting in him being hyper-intelligent but also uncontrollably murderous. The mission takes Bond from Zorin&apos;s French chateau, to San Francisco, and ultimately to an abandoned mine close to Silicon Valley, where Zorin plans to detonate a bomb which will trigger a cataclysmic earthquake.\n\nThe set pieces are memorable, including a parachute pursuit from the Eiffel Tower, a fire engine chase around the hilly streets of San Francisco, and an airship crash on the Golden Gate bridge. Moore looks a bit old for the part, and his sexual humour bears a greater emphasis than usual of the &quot;dirty old man&quot; baggage. However, he still has an easy-going charisma and good comic timing. Walken makes for a good, supremely confident villain, and is well backed by the fearsome Grace Jones. However, Tanya Roberts Bond girl character is whining and screaming so much in this film that she eventually wears out her welcome. The theme song from Duran Duran is rather too &apos;80s, but the instrumental music by John Barry is stirring and dramatic.\n\nI&apos;m not sure what all the disappointment is about. A View To A Kill is an above average Bond flick with plenty to keep you entertained."

In this movie, you realize how it was back then, and the utopia spirit they lived. The portrait of the great Ren√© Levesque, at the head of the Parti Qu√©becois, is moving, and his speeches sound just right. He is those kind of rare politics who we can trust, because he is loyal, sincere, honest. It&apos;s nevertheless how the movie depicted him, and I really believe he was like that though I don&apos;t know much about Quebec politic past. I had a really nice overview of this important period for the Province with this excellent documentary.\n\nHow to believe in political men? See this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the kind of story that Tom Wolfe might have written. It&apos;s about what he would have called a &quot;status-sphere&quot; and ordinary sociologists would have called a subculture. It&apos;s about competition within a limited environment, about acquiring status, about working your way up the ladder of prestige within a particular specialized structure by means of courage, skill, and strategy. Only instead of the wild blue yonder, or landing on the heaving deck of an aircraft carrier, or NASCAR racing, the thing to be conquered here is Ernest Borgnine, the sadistic conductor who chuckles as he throws hobos off his train, sometimes to their deaths, kind of redoing his Fatso Judson number, so evil that if he did not exist it would be necessary to prevent him.\n\nIt&apos;s a classical subculture in that it has all the features of a closed world with its own values. Everyone seems to know everyone else. And, as in most subcultures, including those that used to be called &quot;primitive societies,&quot; the initiate is given a new name. In other movies exploring such subcultures they may have names like &quot;Fast Eddy,&quot; &quot;Minnesota Fats,&quot; &quot;Maverick,&quot; &quot;Dragstrip,&quot; &quot;Charlie the Gent.&quot; Here they have names like &quot;A Number 1&quot; (Lee Marvin), &quot;Cigaret&quot; (Keith Carradine), and &quot;Shack&quot; (Borgnine). They even had their own written language, a set of pictographs scratched into rocks or written in dirt, conveying messages like, &quot;This family good for a free meal,&quot; or , &quot;Work for a meal,&quot; or, &quot;Stay away. Cops.&quot; There were small communities of hobos, often carved out of track-side garbage dumps. \n\nInteresting cast, by the way, a lot of familiar faces in bit parts -- Simon Oakland, Elija Cook Jr.\n\nMakeup and Wardrobe Departments have done a fine job of turning them into &apos;Bos. They don&apos;t look Hollywood dirty, with a few smears of mud. They just look dirty. Their clothing is filthy. All in all, a good delousing looks called for. Marvin&apos;s face, by the time this was released, looked just beat-up enough, and from life, not booze. And check out his decaying lower incisors.\n\nThe plot has to do with a duel of wits between Marvin, who is determined to demonstrate his skill at the top of the status ziggurat by riding Borgnine&apos;s train to Porland, OR. Borgnine, much to the puzzlement of the rest of the train crew, is obsessed with keeping his freight train clean of hitch-hikers. He&apos;s fiendishly clever in smoking out and hurting riders. Carradine is the kind of youth often called &quot;callow.&quot; He brags a lot and is brave but, alas, is unable to absorb the rules of the game because he plays for reasons of self aggrandizement, not for the team. He winds up in the drink.\n\nThere&apos;s something else about this movie that may keep a viewer interested. It takes place during the depression. The trains are slow, fed by coal, and powered by steam. They rock back and forth gently, as if trying to put a passenger or a stowaway to sleep. And they travel through a sunny evergreen wilderness in the Northwest. It&apos;s the kind of scenic journey you now have to pay for if you want to make a round trip to San Juan, CO. What was in the 1930s essential to a certain kind of existence has now been vulgarized and turned into a tourist&apos;s delight.\n\nIt&apos;s a small story about small people. There is nothing epic about it. The score seems to owe something to Burt Bacharach, who was so successful a few years earlier with &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.&quot; And, for my taste, there are one or two too many choker close-ups filling the screen with monstrous teeth and sweaty flesh. But it&apos;s hard to ignore the movie. You&apos;ll probably want to find out what happens next.",

Our sexy hero, is from the year 2046, who comes back in time after a male seed, some butt ugly looking meanies after her, trying to hinder her efforts. Before I go on, I did think the younger girls were hotter, esp the one that lucky bas...d makes out with in the change rooms. He&apos;s the envy of his uncomely and geeky friends, especially one, who&apos;s so ugly, hell knows where they got this kid from. He gets quite an education down under, which would make some jealous guy&apos;s blood boil. Now with that out of the way, what we have here is certainly something different. If you like hot Asian chicks in bikini&apos;s, the occasional gore trip, or comedy that has you laughing out aloud, this outlandish sex comedy, (it&apos;s the humor which is in abundance, that will get you) that still is yet to be seen hitting DVD shops, is for you, but still has a weakness about it, that could be in the story, where not enough attention was focused on it, but more so on those other qualities I mentioned.",

      "reviewBody": "In this fascinating interview, east German film makers Heynowski and Scheumann try to reveal the true face of western imperialism in Africa, and the result is a propagandistic tour de force: Siegfried Mueller, ex-officer of the Wehrmacht, in the uniform of the Kongolese Army and adorned with the Cross of Iron awarded in 1945, talks about his involvement as a mercenary in Kongo&apos;s civil war in the 1960s. In the course of the film the bottle of Pernod is emptied, and the Major gets more revealing; practically denying his earlier statements about civil killings, the ethics of war and the defense of western libertarian values. Masterfully caricatured with pictures of him and comrades proudly posing with severed skulls, other Nazi officers now active in Afrika and incidental mentioning of American exertion of influence. The tag line reads &quot;Confessions of a Murderer&quot;, and the directors skillfully talk the increasingly drunk Kongo-Mueller into his role and into the the wanted statements. I was deeply impressed by this movie, which gives unique insight into a neglected chapter of the cold war and its zeitgeist, and also its sheer suggestive power, which creates a ghastly image of this smiling murderer. This film was banned in West Germany for many years. Highly recommended, even though extremely hard to find.",

But this is by no way a movie that can be categorized as a horror genre movie. That being said, it surely makes a great argument for many things. One of them being not having religion dictate politics and the law.\n\nApart from the main actress being as beautiful as one can be, the movie gives the viewer more incentives to really feel her struggle ... and her fight to survive/make it in general. While I am in no way a Fulci expert, it seems likely that those claiming this being one of his best movies to be correct.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sometimes a clich√© is finally the best way to make one&apos;s point.&quot; Boris (Larry David) \n\nWoody Allen&apos;s witty movies may seem clich√©d (love does indeed conquer all in most of his romcoms), but they do make a humanistic point couched in Allen&apos;s pessimism and nerdiness. With Larry David playing another Allen alter ego, Boris, a self-proclaimed genius, this misanthrope in Whatever Works is the best characterization of Allen in his recent movies. The movie works for me as the smartest, most enjoyable of this summer with a message countering Allen and his alter ego&apos;s world-weariness.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t take long to look at David&apos;s work co-creating Seinfeld and starring in his own Curb Your Enthusiasm to see that this world-weary worry wart is a good choice to play an Allen-like New York Jewish intellectual. Unfortunately his lack of real acting talent is a hindrance, especially when he slips into shouting many of his lines. Yet when David plays himself more than the stuttering Allen, he becomes relaxed and believable. When David speaks to the audience several times, the sincerity is powerful.\n\nAllen wanted Zero Mostel to play this part; his death in 1977 put the script in mothballs for decades. As an accomplished Broadway and film actor, Mostel underscores David&apos;s limited acting range.\n\nThe conceit of Whatever Works is that older Boris in his 60&apos;s hooks up with twenty-year-old Southern Melodie (Evan Rachel Wood) despite his genius mind rejecting the whole affair as trite but his heart going with &quot;whatever works.&quot; Throughout, Allen juxtaposes the Southern innocence with Northern experience creating a situation where NYC actually transforms the Southerners into urban sybarites, no better exemplified than the transformation of Melodie&apos;s mom (Patricia Clarkson) from bible thumper to artist humper with avant garde photos and multiple lovers. Even her ex-husband, John (Ed Begley, Jr.), has a NYC epiphany of the sexual kind.\n\nAlthough Allen has his characters looking for love with results that will remind you of his Everyone Says I Love You, the sweetness is replaced with a philosophy that encourages searching out whatever works because of the transitory nature of love and life.\n\nThe mixture of love and cynicism allows deep appreciation of irony and the transformative nature of experience."

Xander can succeed where other US Government agents have failed. He must to go underground Praga and infiltrate as undercover agent into Russian ring called Anarchy 99, led by a ruthless mobster(Marton Csokas) who uses nuclear weapons. Xander Cage must combat a cruel enemy far beyond his possibilities, he&apos;s only helped by a gorgeous girl(Asia Argento). Furthermore, Xander is supplied with technological arms by an agent(Michael Roof), similar to Q-James Bond.\n\nThe film contains high-energy action, noisy thrills, struggles, emotion and spectacular scenes. It&apos;s over-the-top action movie plenty of explosions, firepower, gun-play and breathtaking pursuits as when a motorcycle runs afoul with bounds and leaps. The picture is stirring and exciting, though also a routine actioner with no much sense. Tough Diesel as one army man is cool, he&apos;s co-executive producer. Lively musical score by Randy Edelman , adding hard rock, heavy metal and disco-music. The film is produced with high budget by Neal H. Moritz, an action movies producer and usual of Rob Cohen movies. Cohen is a nice director of hits, such as ¬®Stealth, Fast and furious, Daylight, Skulls, Dragonheart¬® among others. It&apos;s followed by an inferior sequel starred by Ice Cube and again with Samuel L Jackson and directed by Lee Tamahori.",

      "reviewBody": "In Nice, the Studios La Victorine is producing the film &quot;Je Vous Presente Pamela&quot;, about a French man that marries the English Pamela in England and brings his wife to France to introduce her to his parents. However, his father and Pamela fall in love with each other and she leaves her husband to live with her father-in-law. The producer Bertrand (Jean Champion) and the director Ferrand (Fran√ßois Truffaut) invite the British Julie Baker (Jacqueline Bisset), who had a nervous breakdown and married her Dr. Nelson (David Markham), to the role of Pamela. \n\nAlong the shooting, the cast and crew are lodged in the Hotel Atlantic and Bertrand and Ferrand have to deal with problems with the stars Severine (Valentina Cortese), an aging artist with drinking problems that affect her performance; the immature, spoiled and needy Alphonse (Jean-Pierre L√©aud); Julie that is emotionally unstable. But in the end, they succeed to complete the film.\n\n&quot;La Nuit Am√©ricaine&quot; is a film about making a film and a great tribute to the cinema. This is one of my favorite Truffaut&apos;s films and the last time I saw it was on 08 January 2001. \n\nIt is impossible to highlight performances in this film, but the mesmerizing beauty of Jacqueline Bisset shines. Jean-Pierre L√©aud performs his usual role of an insecure man, using the same gestures of Antoine Doinel.\n\nIn 1992, Louis Malle explored the storyline of &quot;Je Vous Presente Pamela&quot; in &quot;Damage&quot;. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Noite Americana&quot; (&quot;The American Night&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Donny McAndrew a Vietnam veteran is haunted by the experience of the war, and his conditions seems to be getting worse. His wife Mara seems concerned, but there&apos;s something greedy about her intentions when one night Donny finally cracks.\n\nLikable, slick mystery thriller that works due to it not overly being too clever, but managing to stay one step ahead in its jaded mix of stimulating seductiveness and growing psychological tension. The shady web of paranoia, passion, deceit and underlining guilt never lets story become too comfortable, despite its casual air and fundamental process. Larry Brand and Rebecca Reynolds&apos; compact script plays more towards the taut drama and keeps to this trend, than anything involving charged thrills. But director Gilbert Gates doesn&apos;t discard this aspect, but delivers a pinch-full of jarring jolts to feed the story than to just shock. The film&apos;s slight conclusion makes sense and threw me off, but it seems vague to how it came to end with this payoff, especially after what came before it. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you find it simply plain answer. Gates&apos; expertly handles the excursion with neat, and profitable precision. He peppers up a few atmospheric set pieces, but not in heavy doses. The flowing photography is sharply poised and an extremely effective music score is scorchingly bold. The performances of the three leads; the superbly sly Karen Allen, a wonderfully enigmatic Keith Carradine and Jeff Fahey&apos;s terrifically scarred Donny are engrossingly delivered. Dean Paul Martin, Bernie Casey and Dwight Koss provide fine support.\n\nA well-devised and at times innovative film that kept me entertained, even with the structure&apos;s creeping ambiguity.",

Not to mention the imbecility of NASA scientists sending the thing by regular express mail so as to not cause any attention.\n\nSo now with the quick thinking that characterizes science fiction movies like these the organism is quarantined at a remote rail station and five people are kept in isolation while scientists work to find a cure, for what they&apos;re not sure, but we soon see.\n\nThe only cast name I&apos;m sure you might remember is Ralph Meeker, the rest are total unknowns, at least to me they are. The film is an interesting idea, but one more suited to a television episode of The Outer Limits.",

However, this was not a Hollywood film; it was made in Germany. Secondly, the film&apos;s script was well-written, and took itself seriously; always a big plus for any type of film in any genre. After a half hour into the film, I began to realize that this was no ordinary piece of schock; it was exotic, erotic, and highly entertaining. It possibly could have been the influencer for Irving Thalberg&apos;s creation of Lost Horizon, one of the top ten films of all time. Although not as good as Lost Horizon, this film is easily the best of all French Foreign Legion films, desert films (with the exception of Lawrence of Arabia), and desert soaps (this is a legitimate top ten soap). I am talking about hundreds of films in comparison. Do not miss this production, which, in my opinion, is superior to SHE, a big hit just a few years later. And you thought Atlantis had to be somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Think again.",

This slapstick stab at mimicking the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer gems, paired with reliable foil Fernando Sancho, is all folly and no fun. The fact that the given English title of Ten Killers from Afar bears no relation to the plot is hardly the least of its failings.

Young Dimitrie Vojnov gives a heartfelt performance as Zoran who was not only able to hold his own amidst all the peer pressure and propaganda, but actually effected people around him.  In the supporting cast, Lazar Ristovski of the &quot;Underground&quot; fame got another outstanding role under his belt as a dogmatic &quot;young pioneers&quot; instructor driven to suicide by Zoran&apos;s unrealized nonconformity."

Argentinian director Fernando Birri chose some of the brightest conventions of this innovative film movement in order to make audiences laugh and grow pensive about the fate of poor people with his masterpiece &quot;Los Inundados&quot;.It is an outstanding comedy film with dramatic touches from the father of Latin American cinema.This black and white film truly captures the essence of neo realist cinema as the primary focus is about a poor family forced to make multiple train rides during floods in order to reach safe haven. This is something which is unique as the film&apos;s comic touches separate it from other films of neo realist mode. Fernando Birri uses all possible technical means of his time to depict strength of poor people even in the times of adversity.It is amazing how floods have been picturised at a time when there was hardly any possibility of using special effect related technologies.In &quot;The Flooded Ones&quot;,there is also a depiction of the fight between good and evil. This is the reason why Birri chose to show corrupt bureaucrats who make people&apos;s lives hell. Birri opts for politicians as the idea is to show the influence of politics and corrupt politicians on the lives of ordinary citizens. A great film to watch for someone interested in knowing about films made in Argentina before the boom in the national film industry.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary directed by William Karel is very close to a complete character assassination of french president Nicolas Sarkozy and portrays him as an complete failure as president of France.\n\nPersonally I know very little about Sarkozy, France and it&apos;s domestic policy but this film conducts several interviews with foreign correspondents from newspapers, TV, etc from all over the world such as the BBC, The Economist, The Times, The New York Times, Al Jazeera etc.\n\nTherefore the viewer gets a really broad spectrum from various types of journalists what they think about Sarkozy. And it is not a pretty picture they are showing, Sarkozy seems more about building a good media image about himself then being able to govern France, do a responsible foreign policy etc.\n\nAccording to this documentary Sarkozy hasn&apos;t managed to succeed with much of his promises that he made early on in his presidency and he comes across as an arrogant, insecure, troublemaker. \n\nThere are some really hilarious moments here when Sarkozy tells a man who is critical to him to get lost, Sarkozy being late at meeting in the Vatican etc. All these anecdotes and more makes him an easy target and thus gives the impression that Sarkozy is completely incompetent, and resembles George W. Bush, the 43rd president of USA.\n\nBut is this really an accurate description of Sarkozy and his politics? Is hard to say, but it would been interesting to see what Sarkozy had said himself on some of these serious accusations made about him.\n\nOr at least what his party colleagues or former collaborators like Jacques Chirac, Dominique de Villepin etc think about him, good or bad.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch even though it has a very bias tone against Sarkozy, and lacks a fair and balanced view."

One of the main commentators in this movie is Noble Prize winner J. Stiglitz who heavily criticized the operations and policies of the World Bank and the IMF in his books. The movie scrutinizes mainly four examples of privatization: water in Bolivia (the explosion of the water price provoked a popular revolt which forced a big transnational corporation to close its operations), railways in Great-Britain, electricity in South-Africa and health care in the Philippines. The devastating effect of the implementation of the &apos;free market&apos; doctrine on innocent populations is most blatantly exposed in the last example, where ill and handicapped people are struggling to pay their medical bills (the cynical motto is &apos;pay or die&apos;). Florian Opitz made a most convincing documentary on an ideological &apos;human scandal&apos;. His movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost spooky film. I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip&apos;s feet. It gave me the chills for some reason...\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see Bette Davis coming into herself right before your eyes. She&apos;s great, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, gritty, and unflinching as an actress in 1934... Bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it. If you&apos;re a true lover of film, it&apos;s amazing to see...\n\nShe just had a way of delivering a line that made the part, and the film for that matter, belong to her. Like &quot;A mass of music and fire. That&apos;s me...an old kazoo and some sparklers&quot; or &quot;But you are Blanche, you are in that chair!&quot; or &quot;WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE THE MAN I KILLED!!&quot;... Those are from a few of her films, but you get my drift. She was just so brave, sassy, and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can&apos;t believe it was remade twice...\n\nLeslie Howard was gorgeous...so calm and persistent, needing to be loved. I thought he was adorable and couldn&apos;t understand how everyone wasn&apos;t falling for him, but then again, everyone was...except Mildred. He did a great job...\n\nThe only thing that I didn&apos;t like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. They&apos;d make a character so hateful that it&apos;s almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would have never been interested in Mildred. That&apos;s just the simple truth... See it!!",

As simply put the production values are great on this film.\n\nThe story is fairly solid as is the acting throughout for the best part even if a few dodgy aspects towards the end of the film. Though a better back story to the film would have been good to see even if to add just several minutes more to the running time. Yet another film I fail to see or understand the low average rating for as certainly 1 of the best budget films I&apos;ve ever seen.",

And as a comedy, it is an exceptional one!\n\nIf you are looking for suspense or you are not familiar with Italian society, you should stay away from it.

I&apos;ve never been to Mexico to have fun, but this movie brings a piece of what it would be like to be there. Theres a bit of jackass felling, but its not about that at all.\n\nGive it a try, grab you a beer while watching, it will be fun.",

Here, the Griswalds don&apos;t go on a vacation, but instead the family stays in Chicago where there relatives come to town and hell will come too.  Randy Quaid makes this film a treat by having just laugh out loud moments on the screen.  Great fun for the whole family (I think).  A+",

      "reviewBody": "Don Jon (2013) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, director and stars as Jon, a twenty-something man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) who demands that he gives it up for her. DON JON isn&apos;t the greatest film ever made but I will say that I don&apos;t recall ever watching a movie that was so confident. Confidence is something most people lack and even most brass movies lack it but DON JON certainly isn&apos;t afraid to say what it wants to and stick by it. Having a romantic comedy that says watching porn is better than being with women and then tells you why that&apos;s the case is something incredibly rare. What&apos;s even rarer is that this type of subject is usually just played for cheap laughs but here there&apos;s a complete story wrapped around it that asks a lot of questions, gives a lot of answers and as I said, is 100% confident about itself. The confidence just really jumps off the screen unlike any movie I&apos;ve ever seen and that&apos;s where the original aspect of this film comes. There have been countless movies that downplay women but this one here just does so in such a fresh and original way that you can&apos;t help but enjoy it. It also is very smart about guys, their mentality on sex and various other issues. Gordon-Levitt does a wonderful job all around but especially in the acting department. As the writer he certainly knows this character very well but it still takes a very strong performance to get that to the screen and the actor does a fabulous job. Johansson also turns in her greatest work outside of a Woody Allen picture and Tony Danza is very memorable in his supporting bit as is Glenne Headly and Julianne Moore. The screenplay is certainly dirty and covers a lot of topics but the film never crosses the offensive line. The main reason it doesn&apos;t cross the line is that it remains smart no matter what it&apos;s saying and how dirty it&apos;s being said. DON JON is certainly a refreshing film that should get one excited thinking that Gordon-Levitt could turn into someone to keep your eye on not just as an actor but as a writer and director."

      "name": "Very Broad and Over The Top Comedy Doesn&apos;t Have The Characters To Make You Love It But Is Fine Enough For A Look",
      "reviewBody": "The Pizza Triangle is a cute enough Italian romantic comedy with some really outlandish touches around the center and a nicely scuzzy character played by the normally smooth Marcello Mastriani. These last two things would probably be trimmed tho (including its ending) would it have been a bigger hit in Italy and then remade for America so maybe its good it wasn&apos;t remade...but then again most people would have also heard of this and it&apos;d be much more widely available to watch today as well so maybe that&apos;s not a good thing then.\n\nMonica Vitti wildly overplays the fun loving/fast living woman at the center of the love triangle. She spots Marcello Mastriani not as the handsome man you normally see but as a drunk guy passed out on the street and instantly falls in love with him (i know but its a movie!) each one is sure they&apos;ve seen each other before in a shop and were attracted to each other then so when she spots him laying in that gutter he&apos;s certainly pleased to wake up and see her standing over him. Unfortunately for her--he ends up being a wildly jealous boar who is prone to fits of both the drinking and temper kind and is soon turning her attentions to the swooning pizza maker in the little eatery that Mastriani keeps taking her to. The pizza maker played by a rather youngish Giancarlo Gianni woos her right under Marcello&apos;s nose with a slice of pizza in the shape of a heart---its a very cute scene when Vitti gets the heart shaped slice of pizza looks up and sees Gianni staring at her--its one of those meet cute scenes that would totally be at home in a big Hollywood romance (which is why i&apos;m surprised this wasn&apos;t redone quite honestly) and while Vitti and her pizza maker start cuddling up Marcello starts questioning himself and his ability to hold a relationship and generally being a mope--except for when he&apos;s throwing one of his fits. Eventually he and the pizza chef (who already knew each other cause well Marcello eats his food) decide to try and share Monica Vitti--and as anyone who&apos;s ever seen Vitti in her prime can attest--half a Vitti is better then no Vitti at all.\n\nThe attempts at Jules and Jilm like comedy don&apos;t really mesh with the kind of angry, self righteous character that had been Mastriani&apos;s character up to that point, and you can pretty much guess where the film goes once the 2 guys decide to try and share Vitti. The movie doesn&apos;t quite live up to the first 5 or 10 minutes as a whole. When you see that sequence of Vitti at the fair and spotting Mastriani and then Mastriani seeing her--you think OK this is going to be very well filmed and is going to be passionate as all get out. It doesn&apos;t really pan out that way and not because of Mastriani&apos;s rather bitter character--its more because the film&apos;s attempts at humor are just too over the top to take seriously---Mastriani and Vitti share a fly together (mastriani&apos;s character is so filthy at the beginning that he keeps doing battle with the same fly--who Vitti then calls &quot;our fly&quot; and indeed whenever she starts to feel Mastriani&apos;s presence--you hear the fly buzzing on the soundtrack and sometimes see it actually flying around the screen as well--its a neat touch but one that&apos;s also irritating the more times it happens) Vitti&apos;s character herself is so over the top and so fickle--i personally stopped caring about which of the 2 suitors she&apos;s going to end up with long before she actually makes a decision (and then promptly changes her mind a couple more times for good measure) The film was enjoyable enough--its certainly pretty to look at for the most part--but the character&apos;s behavior and the fact that everything is done in these big broad strokes makes the rest of the film not as good as it could&apos;ve been....the way Vitti carries on i would&apos;ve thought that this was a role that Sophia Loren had turned down quite honestly--it wouldn&apos;t be hard to see why Loren would of turned this one down--the character that Vitti&apos;s playing is nowhere near the head strong, self sufficient larger then life characters that Loren had come to fame playing, and that&apos;s part of the main problem of the movie itself."

People run around screaming--not out of fright but rather for no apparent reason--doing and saying supposedly &quot;outrageous&quot; things meant to provoke shocked laughter. It is just tiresome and extremely boring.\n\nThe gore is very poorly done, in the H. G. Lewis manner. Animal innards are simply placed on top of the actors to suggest disembowelments and such. The best thing I could say about it is that it is surprisingly polished and professional looking for a one hour &quot;art&quot; film. What I had expected and hoped to find however was something gritty and grimy-looking, such as the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",

This is a film from beginning to end about pestilence. There is the actual plague. There are characters who are walking demonstrations of pestilence. There is the sad, defeated, Count who, as we all know, is not happy with his condition, but is programmed to steep himself in blood. The characters of Kinski and Adjani are on a collision course. Only through human sacrifice and lust can this demon be destroyed. It&apos;s a gray, striking film, full of sadness and despair. Kinski is visually stunning as the vampire. He is remindful of count Orlock in the Murnau film. There is more sensuality in this film (there are less limitations). Still, like its predecessor, the star of the show is death and the scenes with the rats and the people dancing away their last days, the coffins carried through the streets, are as striking as any performance. Herzog brings out the weight of human despair.",

By the fourth time, I was able to view it more objectively, specifically to see if there were not enough soccer scenes. The balance of scenes on and off the pitch is about right, but I agree with others that more soccer would be better. The contrast of black and white gave the film an edginess not possible with color. The photographs at the end contributed to the overall balance of emotion. Rodrigo Santoro was unbelievably superb and the actresses, Aline Moraes and Angie Cepeda complemented him well. Would we like to see more of him playing soccer? Sure, in another movie or as an added feature on the Heleno DVD. I recommend all of Santoro&apos;s films.",

When I rewatch the movie today in 2019 it definitely not holds up well especially with the incoherent story and stupid decisions of some characters but again this movie never meant to be the one movie that exposed the real face of Vietnam show business to the world plus the cheese factor of the movie pretty damn high so I still find it enjoyable despite the flaws.",

(The fourth I think is not yet made.) All concern men of great power at decisive and tragic moments. &quot;Moloch&quot; concerns Hitler in 1942 in an eagle&apos;s nest castle in the Bavarian Alps, isolated, as in other portraits, among his cadres and Eva Braun, indulging in grumpy vegetarian dinners and tossing about weird racist remarks about other nationalities. This is acted by strong members of the theater of St. Petersburg, Elena Rufanova as Eva Barun, Leonid Mosgovoi as Hitler, Leonid Solol as Goebbels, Yelena Spirindonova as Frau Goebbels, Vladimir Bogdanov as Martin Bormann, whose lines are dubbed by German actors, and this is done well. The whole is bathed in a murky green-gray or verdigris fog -- saturated, someone has written, with a kind of patina characteristic of old Agfa films -- the fogginess typical also of Sokurov&apos;s style elsewhere, with (as in The Sun) a sumptuous feel in the mise-en-sc√®ne and amazing, evocative period realness to objects (photo books, ashtrays, serving dishes) which seem at once solid and delicate. Yes, this is remarkable film-making. But the film as a whole is yawn-inducing. Hitler spends most of his screen time moaning about his health. Ten minutes are devoted to Eva&apos;s wandering around naked without a word spoken. She is graceful and athletic; but why? Well, to evoke the boredom and idleness of the isolated concubine -- but is such length necessary? &quot;Moloch&quot; is very different from, and rather disappointing in comparison to, &quot;The Sun&apos;s&quot; stunning, touching portrayal of Hirohito, which dwells also on trivial moments, but always in the cause of a sensitive exploration of character and situation. There is a hushed intimacy about &quot;The Sun&quot; that &quot;Moloch&quot;, though it has a few grand moments and may even evoke Lang&apos;s &quot;Metropolis,&quot; never attempts. Hitler doesn&apos;t even really talk enough, and this brings us to the inevitable fact that at this date, 2006, &quot;Moloch&quot; is thoroughly overshadowed by the far more conventional, sometimes heavy-handed, but nonetheless richly detailed and accurate and breathlessly exciting recreation of the last days in the Bunker achieved recently by Oliver Hirschbiegel in his &quot;Downfall&quot; (&quot;Der Untergang,&quot; 2004), released in the US last year and containing Bruno Ganz&apos;s powerful performance as the Nazi dictator.",

      "reviewBody": "When this movie came out, I was genuinely hopeful. The concept of hungry ghosts is a central part of the tradition of Chinese Ancestor Worship, and had great potential for an excellent movie melding the supernatural and horror. The script writers even set it during an actual event in the Chinese year, a festival sharing much in common with the true traditions of All Hallows Eve. Unfortunately, that is as far as it went.\n\nThe film does not make the error that many movies make substituting gore for horror. There is enough blood to add to the suspense, and increase the tension that is central to this kind of movie. The script is serviceable. The protagonists never engage in the typical &quot;how could they be so stupid&quot; stereotypes of a true horror film. Their actions, at times foolish, were consistent with their characters as urban Americans enjoying their honeymoon in an exotic land. The actions of the other characters in the film are similarly plausible.\n\nThe problem is that the movie never really comes together. You vaguely like the young couple, and that&apos;s about it. You respect the actions of the only other real player in the movie towards the end, but I doubt he even has a total of ten minutes of screen time. The monsters are scary, and appropriately monstrous. None of this is the makings of great cinema.\n\nMy wife, upon the conclusion of the movie, asked me &quot;What&apos;s the Point?&quot; She meant it rhetorically, because we both had no trouble understanding what was going on during the movie. Yet that comment sums up succinctly my own reaction upon watching it. It wasn&apos;t a waste of 87 minutes of my life, and since the rental was free I don&apos;t feel ripped off. It&apos;s just very sad when this had the potential to be a very good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Intellectuals have written volumes on this strange film by Italian New Wave director, Federico Fellini. I am not an intellectual, so my review will be brief. At its most basic, &quot;8 1/2&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Otto e mezzo&quot;) concerns Guido, a film director (supposedly a surrogate for Fellini himself), who is having what amounts to a midlife crisis. Guido is frustrated in his film-making, and by his relations with other people in his life. But the film&apos;s story does not proceed in a traditional, linear fashion. Fellini more or less abandons logical narration, in favor of &quot;open form&quot; narration, wherein the story&apos;s causal chain of events is broken.\n\nThus, trying to figure out what is going on in this film can be hard. Guido&apos;s fantasies, memories, dreams, and reality co-mingle in a kind of cinematic stew. Fellini presents viewers with a kaleidoscope of surreal B&amp;W images of ordinary objects and eccentric, chattering characters which interact with Guido and with each other, in ways that defy logic, and give breathtaking meaning to the term symbolism. Followers of psychologist Carl Jung would have a field day. In style, the film is flamboyant. In substance, the film is maddeningly subliminal. And yet, even the most metallic cynic, Pauline Kael notwithstanding, must surely appreciate the rareness of Fellini&apos;s probing introspection.\n\nGiven the bizarre, unstructured content of &quot;8 1/2&quot;, I wonder about the issue of necessity. Suppose Fellini had added an extra ten minutes to the screenplay, or deleted ten minutes. Would that have made any difference? Apart from Guido, if this or that character had been deleted, how would that have changed the story&apos;s significance? And if, as some have suggested, the film is a mirror image of Fellini&apos;s own confused psyche, can the story be construed as an intuition of his future film-making?\n\n&quot;Otto e mezzo&quot; is not for everyone. Like a Zen koan, &quot;8 1/2&quot; invites frustration. It is above all else a celebration of ambiguity and abstraction, a cinematic experience to ponder, especially on the heels of four or five martinis ... or 8 1/2, if you really want to induce immense intellectual insight. Cheers."

      "reviewBody": "SUMMER in Berlin (Vor dem Balkon). Viewed at San Sebastian, 2005, image1.jpeg Director Andreas Dresen. Featuring actress Nadla Uhl. My personal favorite in competition here was &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot;, (Sommer vorm Balkon) which is an extremely funny social drama set in the run down Prenzlauer Berg district of East Berlin. Andreas Desen, who is steadily building up a filmography of highly regarded independent films, is arguably the most talented and innovative director currently at work in Germany and has already picked up many prizes in a relatively short career. In &quot;Summer before the balcony&quot; (literal translation of the German title) two woman, one an extremely sexy and generally appealing blonde (Nadja Uhl) about 30, and a 39 year old still attractive but highly neurotic brunette, (Inka Frierich) are neighbors in the same tenement and such close friends that there is a borderline erotic bond between them. Uhl, the drop-dead attractive blonde (altho most of the time dressed in cheap jeans and over- tight jerseys) works as an attendant to pathetic helpless old people living alone, which requires her to wipe up rectum juice and other unsavory tasks, but she goes about it with a sunny good natured disposition.\n\nMeanwhile her unemployed divorced brunette buddy has, among other things, a heavy drinking problem, a young daughter, and a tendency to suicidal self-destruction. Enter Andreas the blunt-spoken tattooed slob of a truck driver who, in spite of the fact that he looks like a geek, seems to have a fatal attraction for all of the women who hang out in the drinking dive which is the meeting place for all the low-life characters in the neighborhood. At first it seems impossible that such a beauty as Nadja could ever go for such geek, but there is more to geek than meets the eye ‚Äì such as a number of former wives and children scattered about the German map and a certain free-wheeling, disarming existentiality. Actor Andreas Schmidt is the kind of character who needs to do nothing more than walk across the screen to make the audience crack up.\n\nThis picture is a slice of many lives, people trying to keep afloat as best they can in a prosperous society that has passed them by. It&apos;s hard to explain why this is all so ha-ha funny, but it is, and it all ends up on a somewhat promising up-beat note. I would give this picture all the Conchas ‚Äì with a double Concha for Nadja Uhl ‚Äì but, alas, I&apos;m not on the jury, and juries tend to have very strange minds of their own. By the way, the script by Wolfgang Kohlhaase is so damn good that it looks like there wasn&apos;t any script at all, and the actors were just making the story up as they went along with a little nudging from the director -- and the music is a subtle underpinning of German hits from the seventies that never intrudes but sounds like it emanates from the hearts of the characters themselves. I&apos;m still not sure whether it was just that Nadja totally blew my mind or that the picture really is this good. In any case, this is one to watch for if it ever comes your way.",

This movie also was moving, but it did feel a bit blown out of proportion.\n\nI actually enjoyed all the stuff with Kong, which i expected to be extremely annoying and stupid.\n\nIt was just a fun little movie to watch, that may feel extremely long. For some reason, this film felt like it was like 3 hours long, which was fine, since it was an enjoyable experience.\n\nI would give this a 7/10.",

Throughout this long thought lost film you see clearly harrowing images of people at the institution. The soundtrack only adds to the foreboding. There are people lying catatonic and there is a dancer who doesn&apos;t stop dancing until she drops to the floor, exhausted. The film is 59 minutes long, I think it was originally longer but this was all that was found. There are no inter titles, its a silent film. In Japan, I am certain the benshi narrated the story in theaters, but your imagination has to follow this story. So, why a 7? It is daring, unflinching, brave and both ugly and not at the same time. As a point of reference only, Guy Maddin&apos;s work approaches this. Just know going in there is no happiness here. You won&apos;t soon forget this film. Best idea: Don&apos;t watch it before bedtime, it will stay with you.",

      "reviewBody": "The Tempest is not the most riveting drama, the larger realization is after all a certain weariness with it. This is given to us as a magician who halfway through the story abandons his powers of illusion, who after conjuring to him the characters and plotting the story of revenge pauses to reflect on the emptiness of the endeavor. It&apos;s still powerful then, because we are all Prosperos alone in our island with the thoughts we conjure up to inhabit.\n\nIn Shakespeare&apos;s time, the inspiration for Prospero must have likely come from the scandalous topic of John Dee, the communion with spirits and visions through crystals certainly point at that as well as more broadly the notion of a benign magic. Magic since well before Dee and up to Crowley has tried its best to mask in so much hoopla what other spiritual traditions make clear from the start: that man is an embodied consciousness with the ability to direct that consciousness to vision. Shakespeare no doubt understood this was exactly his own art, a rich and complicated magic of conjured vision in peoples&apos; minds.\n\nSo if this is to be powerful, you have to adopt a very intricate stance. Show both the power of illusion as vision and, contradictory, the emptiness of it, the fact it is underpinned by an illusory nature of reality. Greenaway masterfully did this in his Prospero film by having Prospero&apos;s creation of the play as vision, the vision lush and wonderful, and yet at every turn shown to exist on a stage.\n\nTaymor is too earnest to strike this stance, in fact judging by the cinematic fabrics here she seems unsure of what direction to follow. She is an earthy woman so intuitively builds on landscape, volcanic rock under our feet. Pasolini could soar in this approach judging from his mythic films, her approach is too usual and without awe. The magic is also too ordinary. A few movie effects cobbled together in earnest as something to woo simple souls like Trinculo. Compared to the novel richness of Greenaway this feels like discarded Harry Potter work. And the cinematic navigation is without any adventure, as if Taymor didn&apos;t believe there was anything for her to discover outside the play, to conjure up in the landscape itself by wandering to it, so she never strays in visual reflection.\n\nMirren conveys the reflection as best she can, but that is all here, too little."

      "reviewBody": "Hi, This film is an all time hard rock classic! I love my music flicks and especially movies or docs on rock bands. This film is very raw and is basically showing viewers what AC/DC do best and that&apos;s play live concerts. They are one of the greatest live rock bands of all time and this movie/documentary shows them playing live in Paris at their peak. Prior to 1979 AC/DC had already conquered Australia and were making big in-roads in the UK &amp; Europe. With this growing success their next target audience was the US. AC/DC desperately wanted a hit single and/or album in the US. It came with the Highway to Hell single and album of the same name in 1979. Shortly after this AC/DC toured UK, Europe and the US. This film captures a young band playing live and at a time when they were at their best. The concert in Paris is simply awesome with lead guitarist Angus Young mesmerizing the audience with his energy on stage and his great guitar playing skills. On a whole the band&apos;s playing is tight, loud and the guitar riffs awesome to say the least. Malcom Young&apos;s rhythm guitar skills are faultless, Phil Rudd on drums never skips a beat and Cliff Williams is the same and lead singer Bon Scott is a true rocker and a great show man. The movie cuts from their live concert in Paris to interviews with band members and filming of them doing their hobbies etc... Not overly interesting but it does show the bands down to earth personalty. I would not worry about that too much as the film is more about how damn good this band was live and it shows the whole concert. And they were AWESOME! In February 1980 lead singer Bon Scott tragically died after a night out on the drink. This was one of his last live shows and most likely the last bit of footage of Bon Scott leading AC/DC live in concert. This is raw no rubbish hard rock at it&apos;s absolute best!! A must see for AC/DC fans or any true rock followers and admirers of raw musical talent. Brilliant movie/doc of a great rock band at their peak. Sadly this movie is hard to get and unfortunately has only ever been released on VHS. Why they have not released this on DVD is unbelievable, it deserves to be on DVD! Highly recommend!! Cheers, Bradley",

      "reviewBody": "Douglas Sirk (original name Hans Detlef Sierck) is mostly remembered for his American films, and even these ones were long viewed as cheap commercial successes.\n\nBut he also made some (largely forgotten) films in Germany. I don&apos;t know why his German films are seldom seen. Is it because one suspects a Nazi flavour? This is not realy the case. Sierck left Nazi Germany relatively late (1937) but his second wife was Jewish and politically he was certainly no supporter of National Socialism. Is it because his German films are real melodrama&apos;s? Could be. In his American films beneath the melodrama there is a second layer with hidden criticism on bourgeois moralism. This second layer is absent in his German films if only because they do not play in bourgeois circles but more often in aristocratic circles with their own codes of honor.\n\nThis is not to say that his German films are not worth watching. His two films with the Swedish star Zarah Leander (&quot;Habanera&quot; and &quot;Zu neuen Ufern&quot;, both of 1937) are certainly entertaining. Of this two films I prefer &quot;Zu neuen Ufern&quot;, in which Zarah Leander plays a tragic woman who seems to fall for the wrong man. The film does have a touch of Brecht in it, and this is not by chance because a few years earlier Sierck directed &quot;The threepenny opera&quot; for stage.",

A bittersweet, tender romance movie is not really meant to move mountains artistically, nor should it be expected to. But this one does draw you in, emotionally, for better or for worse. Case in point: Look at all the IMDb comments posted on it! And as for those who would have liked more sizzle in the romance between Affleck and Paltrow, remember, this is a film that also has the death of Abby&apos;s husband as its constant backdrop, hence, the film&apos;s rather understated treatment of their romance, I think.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the documentary at a docu-fiction festival that is screened every year in my city and I also watched it with my kids (10+).\n\nThe documentary is very good in terms of actions, suspense and overall story. It is very enjoyable to watch.\n\nIt describes the bad practice of banana production in the 70s and possibly later in the great plantations of Dole and the like. Airplanes sprayed chemicals on plantations on plants, fruits, and ... workers. Those are basically drenched by the chemicals. Unsurprisingly they developed all sorts of illnesses.\n\nThe documentary produced some good evidence (such as letters) that pesticides were actually sprayed on people. Possibly also that this massive use of pesticides continued even after those chemicals were banned in the U.S. and the interviews with the Dole people and the farmers are very good (no matter on whose side you are standing one).\n\nThe factual accuracy may be a bit shaky and sometimes the romancing of the story gets in the way. For example there is not a recap of the facts by the lawyer, who is the main character of the movies. It is a &quot;to say and not say&quot;, &quot;we will discover in the court&quot;, etc. Albeit they might have wanted to avoid legal challenges by Dole, they could have been more precise. This is OK for legal thriller, a bit less for the documentary.\n\nAt the end of the day, the kids liked it, they found it an interesting story and the main message went through.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched &quot;Airport&quot; on TCM. It was the first time I had seen it in its original widescreen format since it came out in 1970. I was surprised at how well it has held up with the passage of time. Although there have been disaster movies from the beginning of cinema in the late 19th century and one that dealt specifically with an airplane in danger (&quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;), this was the film that launched the modern disaster craze that produced &quot;The Towering Inferno,&quot; &quot;The Poseidon Adventure,&quot; and countless others including &quot;The Day After Tomorrow.&quot; The hilarious spoof &quot;Airplane&quot; which poked fun at the clich√©s and pretentiousness of the films did much to discredit the genre until recently.\n\n&quot;Airport&quot; was based on the popular best seller by Arthur Hailey. Although over two hours long, the movie moves and the viewer never gets bored. The stellar cast does an exceptional job with a standout performance by the legendary Helen Hayes. The ending is both happy and sad. So it does not cop out on several key themes of the story. Many of the roles, such as George Kennedy&apos;s Joe Patroni, are played lightly and this adds zest to the performances. When the script begins to get syrupy a new element of emergency is thrown in to pick it up and go.\n\nForget all the clich√©-ridden disaster flicks you have seen since &quot;Airport.&quot; You will be entertained and not feel cheated when the closing credits appear.",

I wanted to have his faith, to be capable of loving like he did in the movie.\n\nThis film made me become a missionary. I went on to work, as missionary, in Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Morocco, Malawi, and my home country Portugal.\n\nI don&apos;t want to tell the things I did, but I just want to recognize, that a good film can change a life and change so many others.\n\nGreat Film. Thank you Jeremy Irons, I still want to be as Father Gabriel, after all this years."

And while I suppose it&apos;s possible that a handful of Americans existed who understood and respected the bushido culture of Imperial Japan, they were probably nonexistent in the war zone, and therefore I found Captain Lewis&apos; character to be totally unrealistic.\n\nI can&apos;t speak for the acting of the Japanese. As for the Americans, Treat Williams and Daniel Baldwin can act. I can&apos;t say the same about the rest of the cast; they are terrible.\n\nThis is a Japanese film. Given the enormous scope and nature of their aggression and war crimes in the 1930s and 40s (dubbed The Asian Holocaust), and given their longstanding refusal to acknowledge said crimes, or apologize to their tens of millions of victims, I find that any portrayal by the Japanese of their WW II soldiers as heroic - even if probably true - leaves a bad taste in my mouth. This was a film that should never have been made. Imagine if modern-day Germany released a film depicting the bravery and loyalty of their soldiers in 1942. It&apos;s just unseemly, no matter how accurate.",

The most positive thing about this movie is beautiful and erotic Bellucci taking her clothes off but the plot is so poor I can&apos;t understand Gerard Depardieu playing such a one-dimensional person. \n\nThe dialogs are sometimes ridiculous, maybe unintentionally because of the bad German synchronization I watched. It is not enough to play classical opera music instead of creating a convincing dramaturgy and script. \n\nBut to mention some positive aspects as well, there are plenty of breathtaking stills like Bellucci sitting in the window of the bar in Pigalle or &quot;Francois&quot; and &quot;Daniela&quot; at the beach, so the movie offers, as French cinema often does, excellent aesthetic quality. Accepting that this is cinema showing totally artificial characters, you might have a good time watching this movie.",

It allows the Dutch SS veterans to give their reasons for joining, what motivated them.\n\nA couple have regrets, one seems genuinely remorseful of his actions when 18 years old. More telling and frightening is that the majority have no remorse, are proud of their contribution and outwardly anti semetic.\n\nNow all the participants have died this movie documentary serves as a valuable historical record which I believe should be shown in schools so we don&apos;t forget how easily it is to fall in line and discriminate and hate.\n\nThe director used no frills or sensational gimmicks, just dialogue which works.\n\nAnyone interested in history or social psychology should watch this.",

Sincere without being sentimental (much like &quot;Miracle,&quot; O&apos;Connor&apos;s last effort), &quot;Pride and Glory&quot; gets elbow deep in a corruption scandal that threatens to crack the blue wall of the NYPD and destroy the Tierney family legacy (patriarch Jon Voight, sons Ed Norton and Noah Emmerich, and outlaw brother-in-law Colin Farrell, who has never been better). A muscular, old-school American film, with big themes splashed on a big canvas, &quot;Pride and Glory&quot; is familiar and original at the same time. In the Age of Irony, these are the kinds of movies you rarely see anymore. An honest, gripping drama."

      "reviewBody": "Writer-director Kore-eda has a strong fanbase in Singapore after his well-received Nobody Knows garnered him quite the following from a screening here years back. No sooner than the festival&apos;s tickets had gone on sale that it registered its first sell-out session in Air Doll, and two other subsequent repeat screenings released had all its tickets already snapped up. Either that, or the appeal of watching a sex doll come to life under Singapore&apos;s R21 rating uncut is too hard to pass up. I had that opportunity to partake in a masterclass session with Kore-eda during last year&apos;s Tokyo International Film Festival where three of his films got screened overnight with the director and his guests in attendance, but alas I wasn&apos;t in top form to have covered it. I&apos;m regretting it now.\n\nThe other film I had watched with a sex doll featured prominently in the story was Craig Gillespie&apos;s Lars and the Real Girl starring Ryan Gosling, where his character bought a custom made sex doll over the internet not for sex, but for companionship. Personally I&apos;ve always thought it creepy for anyone to own a doll to interact with and yikes, to make love to, and here even christening it Nozomi. But as a character in Air Doll puts it, a real life relationship may be too hard for some folks to handle because it comes with inevitable problems, warts and all. And yes while that&apos;s the truth, I still can&apos;t fathom the necessity of owning a doll for sexual gratification, but I digress.\n\nKore-da&apos;s Air Doll is a fantasy film along the lines of Pinnochio, where an inanimate object comes to life and dreams of being a real boy. Here, it&apos;s all the more creepier when the air doll Nozomi suddenly without reason nor forewarning, starts to move on her own, and develops heart and soul through the course of the story. She doesn&apos;t need to yearn to be real, because she&apos;s almost real, utilizing clothing and makeup to conceal portions of her that are tell-tale signs that she&apos;s a life-sized made-of-plastic Barbie doll coming in the form of Korean actress Bae Doo-na (last seen in the Korean monster film The Host). \n\nBae brings her Nozomi a sense of that wide-eyed wonderment of the real world, and her performance as a plastic inflatable doll is flawless, with Nozomi constantly in amazement from the assault of the senses of sight, sound and touch. There&apos;s also a comedic innocence brought about through her zilch knowledge of the real world, which of course we&apos;ll expect this to be exploited by nastier humans, because the world is as evil as such, where innocence has no place once her honeymoon period is over. Balancing her routine very carefully with that of her owner Hideo&apos;s (Itsuji Itao) in order to enable her to work at a video store in the day, living an independent life undetected, and then being back at home on time to fulfill Hideo&apos;s sexual needs, things start to become a little more complicated when she develops feelings for her colleague Junichi (Arata).\n\nPaced slowly to mirror Nozomi&apos;s journey of discovery of all things beautiful, from cosmetics to toddlers to that proverbial flower along the sidewalk, Air Doll contains a few scenes that provide that stark commentary about the emptiness of soul and the loneliness experienced in big city living. To Nozomi it&apos;s an abstract concept that she grasps only literally, but for the rest of us, we&apos;re likely to nod in agreement with the statements, since we&apos;re experiencing such feelings day in and day out. It is these episodes and incidents, through Nozomi&apos;s interactions with others that bring the film to life, and some of these can be as short as one self-contained scene like the one on the bus where she lends her shoulder to a sleeping man. It&apos;s all within our means to show a little compassion and to make the world a better place to live in.\n\nWhile yet consumed with a pop kind of feeling throughout, and Kore-eda&apos;s most erotic film to date, the film is a meditation of life, and the fragility of it, where people are constantly in search of substitutes for things they cannot obtain to fulfill some need or want, which reflects quite well of our modern life where distractions are many, and substitution being a way of life from products to services. I absolutely loved how Kore-eda provided us scenes of satisfaction with a montage of lonely people doing simple things, to that switch later on with dissatisfaction with the same. It&apos;s a wonderful fantasy film that makes us reflect on our own parallels, but doesn&apos;t do so in a preachy way, instead relying on tragedy and especially comedy through the literal interpretation of things, to lighten the mood. \n\nThe science-fiction equivalent will be something like Spielberg&apos;s A.I., where a young robot embarks on a quest to find his mother and become a real boy This air doll has plenty of humanity inside her, full of soul and that never-ceasing innocent curiosity that makes it a delight to watch, maintaining touching aspects to tug at your heartstrings. I&apos;m quite certain the audience who have snapped up tickets so eagerly won&apos;t be left disappointed.",

The only problem is the same problem that an Eric Clapton bio had: that is, when talking about their early classic stuff, it cuts to a 1980&apos;s concert, which of course is not only way after the fact, but doesn&apos;t musically tell the story quite the same...\n\nAlthough in the Clapton doc it&apos;s better since you still get those fingers on the fretboard... With Pink Floyd, trying to capture that band at the time this album came out it&apos;s quite hard without just playing the music, which, thankfully they do here in what&apos;s an entertaining but average look into an album that changed a band, and the world.",

The movie is not the greatest in the world, but good enough for bad science fiction fans. The idea of the movie might be used today and rewritten. With the effects that can be done today, it could be funny if someone did it right. I recommend you watch it at least once. Be prepared for dry, goofy humor and sight gags that almost work... but have a sense of humor when you watch it or you will fall asleep. Watch for the bad edits.

      "reviewBody": "After Earth (2013) \n\n* (out of 4)\n\nM. Night Shyamalan&apos;s big-budget vanity project for father and son team Will and Jaden Smith turns out to be much worse than the trailer. In the film, the father and son crash land on the planet Earth a thousand years after the people were forced to leave it. With daddy&apos;s legs broke, the young kid must go out into the scary landscape to retrieve an item that will allow them to make contact with their own world. AFTER EARTH is without question one of the worst sci-fi summer blockbusters ever made. Part of the blame can go towards the director but his handful of haters can&apos;t put everything on him. The incredibly bad screenplay also deserves a lot of the blame but so do the Smith boys. I seem to say this after each of his films but it&apos;s clear young Jaden has yet to take an acting class and just keeps getting passes because of his dad. I&apos;m sorry but he&apos;s just not got a talented bone in his body and he certainly can&apos;t show any type of emotion, which is something the story here called for. The fact that he can&apos;t act to save his life really kills every emotion that the film goes for and it turns these scenes into something rather laughable. Mr. Will Smith doesn&apos;t come in any better. Although I liked his more quiet, laid back style, it just doesn&apos;t work considering the screenplay has him sitting around simply talking to the kid. Where Will deserves a lot of blame is getting his son these type of roles, which he can&apos;t do and which will eventually make him one of the most laughable actors in Hollywood history. The first couple films he did were just embarrassing but no one has given him the word that he can&apos;t act and apparently no one has seen fit to get him into classes so it&apos;s really just getting worse. Still, Shyamalan didn&apos;t improve the film any as there&apos;s really no drama, no suspense and no tension. It also doesn&apos;t help that the screenplay is full of clich√© moments as well as being 100% predictable. I will say that some of the visuals were good but certainly not good enough to sit through this thing."

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this film in the late 80s at the NFT (UK National Film Theatre) with a piano accompaniment. The print was scratchy and the inter-titles longer than several of the scenes. I was expecting it to be interesting as an example of Eisenstein&apos;s use of montage and cross-cutting (and indeed the audience seemed to be composed mainly of film students), thus worthy and perhaps a little dull. Instead, I was stunned. Now released on DVD with a Shostakovitch score and sparse sound effects, the film is revealed as masterpiece which surpasses both Battleship Potyomkin (1925) and Alexander Nevsky (1938) in its use of these two, and many more, filmic devices.\n\nIt&apos;s a young man&apos;s film and completely of its time and place, that is to say it gives a romanticised and idealised view of the Bolshevic revolution and its origins. The Tsar is directly compared to a horse&apos;s arse, Lenin harangues from the front of a steam engine, the proletariat are the true beneficiaries of the revolution. Statues fall apart and are re-formed in reverse motion, the people re-enact the storming of the winter palace (and climb its real gates), the battles cross-cut from faces and hands to carefully staged set pieces. In the second most famous sequence in early film history (the other being the Odessa steps from Potyomkin), a young woman&apos;s hair flops over the edge of a rising bridge while a cart and dead horse drop into the water.\n\nThe film is politically naive but decades ahead of its time in every other respect. The young people who inhabit these pages might like to compare its editing and pacing with that of the average music video and CGI-driven special effects film. I contend there is essentially nothing in these which they will not find in Eisenstein, and in October (Oktyabr) in particular. Yes, it&apos;s black and white, and silent but for the lately added score, and yes, it&apos;s from the early 20th century (by no means the earliest history of film), but it still stuns after repeated viewing. This is where modern film-making started, and everything we think we know about it (slow motion, montage, cross-cuts, reverses, you name it) had its origins in Eisenstein. The inter-titles (not sub-titles) still go on too long, though.",

      "reviewBody": "The irony of an ex-cop Olivier Marchal, co-writing, directing and acting in a somewhat true tale of real life French criminal Edmond Vidal aka Momon is something some, like me will find irresistably attractive. Surprisingly, although we are left in no doubt that Vidal and his compatriots are mired in the underworld and its sins, this film paints quite a sympathetic and humanistic portrait of its central players.\n\nThere is nothing really original about Gang Story (including the title). It&apos;s a story we&apos;ve seen before (rise and fall of a career criminal and his associates), told in a semi-linear style combining plentiful flashbacks to pivotal past moments with present day events (The Godfather Part 2 and Goodfellas). Marchal frequently acknowledges and pays homage to Coppola and Scorsese throughout the film, but I personally would have preferred to have seen him, as Coppola does, use longer sequences before changing time periods. It does get unsettling, if not annoying and confusing, when some of these intercut scenes last all of 10 seconds, before changing time periods. I also would have appreciated an elaboration on the childhood relationship between Momon and Serge, which I think would have strengthened the story even more. Onscreen, it&apos;s all over within a minute, before we move on to when they were young adults. And the storyline to this movie, is its real appeal; the bonds of loyalty between crime boss and sidekick stretching over generations and examining how far those bonds can be stretched, before risking permanent dislocation. Gerard Lanvin (Momon) and Tcheky Karyo (Serge) are well cast in the contemporary lead roles, though the film, as mentioned earlier is seen from the former&apos;s perspective.\n\nThe film claims to be based firmly on true events and characters, though I have no idea how close to reality, the depicted events actually are. For all of that, Marchal presents a story, that is never less than compelling, culminating in a climax, which, while some may have predicted, is nevertheless full of pathos and feeling. Gang Story is worth your acquaintance.",

The film, however, is not only inferior to THE DEVIL&apos;S DAFFODIL (1961) ‚Äì which preceded this viewing ‚Äì but only marginally a genre entry¬Öas, rather, than a sadistic masked killer (the German &quot;Krimis&quot; were obvious precursors to the Italian &quot;Gialli&quot;) we get rival gangs of Chicago hoodlums who improbably relocate to London to first extort and then dispatch various wealthy elders when they invariably turn to Scotland Yard for protection! Why this is done is never quite clear, especially since they never get to collect; incidentally, we start off with one mobster eliminating his opponents ‚Äì but the only survivor, Kinski, soon sets up his own unit of gun-happy thugs whilst retaining an ostensibly respectable front as a tobacconist. One of the victims bequeaths his fortune to his secretary (Mell) rather than his sole ne&apos;er-do-well relative (who has a propensity for orchids, the only link to the title ‚Äì that is to say, extremely cursory ‚Äì provided by the narrative!); still, he proves to be not what he seems ‚Äì with his final trapping of the heroine inside a bank vault one of the very few scenes pertaining to the form&apos;s recognizable style (another highlight has a car going off the rails after a large mirror set up along the road gave the illusion to the bewildered driver of an imminent head-on collision).\n\nLee does not have much of substance to do as an F.B.I.(!) agent, but he at least gets to display his quick two-gun draw in a shoot-out with one of the baddies. Somewhat more prevalent, regrettably, is a comic-relief butler who happens to have served each of the murdered parties immediately prior to their untimely demise¬Öand, ultimately, even offers his would-be expert services to both one of the perpetrators ‚Äì who promptly winds up dead himself ‚Äì and the Police!",

      "reviewBody": "This film could be called very French. It takes place in the south of France, a playground between/among men and women, has style and is set in stylish places such as hotels and &quot;haut couture&quot; stores.The female character, and even the male one, are amoral but not judged as such by the director and not severely so by the men and women they service. Some of the reviewers have referred to Irene (Audrey Tatou) as a prostitute. This isn&apos;t quite correct. She was a courtesan: a professional mistress chosen as much for her companionship in public as well as private. Like most famous courtesans (e.g &quot;La Dame aux Cammillias&quot;) she seems to have come from poverty of some sort--and is thus rather tough.And Jean could probably be called a gigolo, though the elderly lady who pampers him has only minimal illusions as to why he&apos;s with her. That could be the point: the middle-aged and elderly rich people they play up to are themselves at fault if they want &quot;young stuff&quot; around as companions instead of seeking company their own age. I did like the ending with the Euro.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw this at the Rotterdam film festival 2015 (IFFR). Actually, there are two plots, an unexpected surprise given the running time of only 91 minutes. In the first half of the film we observe how Lilly lives in the nursing home as partner of husband Max, who is the real reason they moved in there. It is clear that Lilly is too healthy for a nursing home, but she had no choice. Thus no surprise that we see a growing love between Lilly and neighbor Erik. As could be expected, this is a relationship being frowned upon by others living in the same nursing house, as well as by her daughter. That other residents gave her dark looks can be easily explained, given that women are a majority there hence a bit of jealousy is evident. Her daughter may have good reasons of her own, fearing that Lilly will decide to separate from Max with whom she lost contact some time ago, due to his illness hardly responding to outside events. Initially, resisting both type of &quot;frowners&quot; seemed to be the main story line. It is a relevant theme with its own merits, and could have been sufficient the fill up the whole running time.\n\nHowever, somewhere halfway we see an 180 degree turn in the story line. Lilly suffers memory problems, something that her daughter already knew for some time. The title &quot;Key House Mirror&quot; refers to a memory test we see failing Lilly on. Of course, she herself does not believe it. Though Max is still alive and present, he becomes less prominent in the story. Lilly gets more and more focus, and also Erik but to a lesser extent. It took some time before Lilly gets convinced that she really has problems with her memory. A hefty scene at the family&apos;s former summer house is a turning point for her.\n\nWhat struck me most in this movie were the scenes in the nursing home. We observe the cosiness in organized form that is upheld for the people living there. It is a daunting preview on our own destiny, in the inevitable years that we cannot take care of our own pastime ways to fill our day anymore, and we may need physical help for each and every move. In the final Q&amp;A we learned that most people we saw in the nursing home were playing themselves. At least 1/3 of the venue (all 372 seats booked) stayed for the Q&amp;A, which is an unusually high fraction. A consensus opinion of those present during the Q&amp;A, apparently people who had personal experience with elderly people, was their spontaneous confirmation that the way these people moved, and the look in their eyes, was true to reality. I consider this an achievement in itself.\n\nFrom the same film maker I saw Northwest (2013). I wrote very positively about it at the time. This new film proves that he can again arrive at a compelling product, albeit within a very different environment and a very different plot. This time we see normal community members rather than the underbelly of our society. Both times he made extensive use of non-professional actors around the main protagonists. From the Q&amp;A after Northwest I remember this being his standard operating procedure, more of less coming from a past as a documentary maker.",

      "reviewBody": "When asked why he titled his third feature-length picture &apos;Bananas,&apos; Woody Allen replied, &quot;because there&apos;s no bananas in it.&quot; This, in a nutshell, pretty much summarises the general tone of the film. During the first ten years of his directing career, it&apos;s interesting to see Allen slowly developing his craft; as the years go by, from &apos;Take the Money and Run (1969)&apos; to &apos;Sleeper (1973),&apos; {and culminating in &apos;Annie Hall (1977)&apos;} we notice how he learned to assimilate an unrelated collection of gags into a mature, cohesive narrative. &apos;Bananas (1971)&apos; sits somewhere in the middle of all this, with a more developed story than its predecessors, but maintaining its roots as an anarchic comedy, much in the same vein as films like &apos;Duck Soup (1933)&apos; and &apos;Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).&apos; Though I had not anticipated enjoying &apos;Bananas&apos; very much, I must say that the film provided countless moments of immeasurable hilarity. Though slightly uneven in parts {as is often the case, some jokes hit while others miss}, the film delivers the promised laughs.\n\nThe storyline is characteristically simple and absurd. After a revolution breaks out in the small South American nation of San Marcos, a mediocre, unintellectual New Yorker, Fielding Mellish (Allen), travels there to impress his ex-girlfriend (Louise Lasser). After the fascist government tries to have him assassinated, poor Fielding falls in with the rebel gangs, somehow eventually becoming the President of the Latin American republic. This absurd plot line allows Allen to pile one gag on top of another, and, interestingly, the story itself never seems to lose its way or go off on any tangents. The film&apos;s satirical take on war, with the Vietnam War still raging in 1971, was very timely, and Allen also aims a few jabs at the media&apos;s handling of warfare ¬ñ in the ridiculous and inspired opening, ABC&apos;s Wide World of Sports arrives in San Marcos to commentate the assassination of the current President. Later, Howard Cosell returns to host the consummation of Fielding&apos;s marriage, with an enthusiastic crowd watching the awkward couple tussling beneath the covers. &apos;Bananas&apos; is a type specimen of one of Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;early, funny movies.&quot;",

This movie chronicles how she deals with her relationship with Roop and how to deal with her six kids--two who are teenagers and starting to fight back.\n\nI&apos;ve never even HEARD of this movie until FXM showed it one night. It seems to have disappeared and that&apos;s too bad. It&apos;s easily got to be one of the most honest and accurate portrayals about growing up poor and black in the city. I&apos;m not black but I&apos;ve read books on the subject and had some friends who lived like this and this movie hits the subjects right on. Also this is one of the few movies where the kids act and talk like kids--not like little adults. The language is strong (there&apos;s plenty of casual swearing and sex talk) but that&apos;s how people act and talk. Also this film doesn&apos;t shrink from Claudine and Roop having sex--it presents it in a matter of fact way. The script is OK but tries to cover all the bases of being poor and struggling with kids--that&apos;s WAY too much for one movie. Also it seems to pile one disaster after another on Claudine. It&apos;s gets to be overkill. I also didn&apos;t buy the happy shots during the closing credits. Still this is an exceptional movie that seems to have fallen between the cracks. The acting is great--Carroll and Jones are so young and full of life and energy. Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this film. Also, among her kids, is Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs who went on the star in the TV series &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot;.\n\nI do have to point out that the language is STRONG in this one and it has flashes of nudity (female). It wouldn&apos;t get a PG today--it would get an R. Still it&apos;s just being honest and there&apos;s nothing wrong with that!",

Using a large cast of children, he is able to get some of the finest performances from many of the child actors, most of whom were Hollywood veterans by this point: George Breakston, Frankie Darro, etc. Yet here, with Borzage&apos;s patient guidance, they give fresh and touching performances. Borzage is always able to find great humanity in his performers, and the sorrowful story becomes truly tragic, because Borzage truly engages your emotions and your mind. This is another movie that is not available, and should be made available (and should be shown as often as possible).",

      "reviewBody": "Ray Elwood is a soldier stationed on a base in West Germany.  With no war to fight the men become bored but Elwood has enough going on the side to keep him busy, whether selling off excess cleaning supplies or dealing drugs. When he lands two trucks worth of weapons he thinks his day has come, however at the same time a tough new officer, Sergeant Lee, is stationed on the base with the aim of cleaning it up - starting with Elwood dealings.\n\nOf course, we all know that this film practically vanished after 9/11; suddenly America didn&apos;t want anything that seemed to be attacking America or the dedicated American soldier.  This was unfortunate as the film isn&apos;t as blatantly anti-war or anti-American as I had been led to believe.  Rather it is a dark comedy that looks at the reality of army life during peacetime. In fairness though it does show the soldiers out for cash, high on drugs and certainly not fitting the image that made Time magazine pick `the American soldier&apos; as man of the year for 2003.\n\nThe basic plot makes MASH look like some sort of kids game - where Hawk-Eye made drink in his tent, Elwood cooks coke and deals in stolen weapons. The story works quite well although some of it didn&apos;t totally work and some of the characters and action didn&apos;t really make sense.  It was amusing without being laugh out loud funny, although this wasn&apos;t so much of a problem as I certainly didn&apos;t expect it to be an out and out comedy.  The drama works better than the comedy and it is for this reason it is a better attack on the ideal of the military.  The upper levels of the military also take a knock; being shown as focused on rank climbing rather than keeping a sharp military machine well oiled!\n\nThe cast is good on the whole - both on paper and on the screen.  Phoenix leads the film really well and delivers a likeable character that is still abhorrent enough to be seen as an attack rather than a spoof.  Harris is OK but he only has a small role and it doesn&apos;t totally fit in with the main narrative very well - likewise McGovern.  Pacquin is pretty cool but her character was a bit of a mystery to me but Glenn is well cast and he is able to deliver the goods in a borderline nuts character; only problem with his performance was that I didn&apos;t totally understand his character&apos;s aims by the end of the film.  Both Leon and Pena were good in support and Dean Stockwell has an OK cameo.\n\nOverall this was a good film despite the fact that it had a plot that was a little weakened by the side issues and characters who aren&apos;t totally clear in terms of what they&apos;re all about.  Aside from this the film is pretty entertaining and is actually quite matter of fact in it&apos;s portrayal of military life rather than being scathing - coming from Northern Ireland, I have seen all sorts of stuff done by squaddies and am well aware of how true this can be!  But to label it anti-American is just plain daft!"

      "reviewBody": "I for one have never really been a big fan of animated cartoon type movies, that is since I&apos;m now an adult but in my past as a kid I treasured them. And being a big &quot;Batman&quot; fan I just had to check out the animated films even as an adult. I must say that this film featuring villain Mr. Freeze: Subzero didn&apos;t let me down either. As Freeze wanted to chill Gotham City this animated film brought red hot explosive action! The drama and story is well laid out with a plot twist that would even appear in a big screen movie. It centers around Barbara Gordon(&quot;Batgirl&quot;) who finds herself being the unlucky one that&apos;s kidnapped by Freeze when he finds out that she&apos;s an organ donor. The thing is the wife of Freeze needs an organ transplant to return to her normal state. Never fear &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Robin&quot; are to the rescue! Really watch this if you haven&apos;t it ends with everyone on a happy note just like the days when you as a kid watched cartoons! Overall great animated work of a &quot;Batman&quot; film.",

The kids acted and spoke like real kids. Dealing with real problems like divorce, adoption, awkwardness with the opposite sex, and having to move away from friends, there is a lot here for the audience to relate to.\n\nI initially thought that there wasn&apos;t a whole lot of character development with the Echo character, but in hindsight, the movie had little to do with Echo and more to do with the kids&apos; journey - on their last night together - to get Echo home.\n\nToo often do I find myself nodding off at these kids movies. This isn&apos;t the kid movie you think it is. Lots of action, suspense, and humor - with an edge, yet I&apos;m pretty sure there is no profanity...and no violence. Here is a little gem that I fear that will get lost in the mix of all of the other Summer blockbusters, but hopefully a little word-of-mouth can make this a surprise hit.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1831, the new Governor (Cecil Parker) arrives in Sydney, Australia, with his noble but broken Irish cousin Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). On the next morning, Charles unsuccessfully goes to the local bank expecting to raise money to start a business and he meets the powerful landowner Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotton), an ex-convict that has raised a fortune in the colony. Sam proposes a business with lands with Charles and invites him to have dinner with him at his farm.\n\nCharles learns that Sam is not accepted by the local society but he goes to the dinner party, where he meets Sam&apos;s wife Henrietta Flusky (Ingrid Bergman), an old acquaintance of his childhood in Ireland. Soon Charles discovers that Henrietta is alcoholic and a totally unstable woman controlled by the housekeeper Milly (Margaret Leighton), and Sam was the stable boy of her family in Ireland. They had fallen in love with each other and Henrietta elopes with Sam. However, her brother hunts them and Sam kills him and is deported to Australia. Charles stays in Sam&apos;s farm to help Henrietta and soon he falls in love with her. Meanwhile Sam is manipulated by Milly and his jealousy gets him into trouble and discloses dark secrets from his past with Henrietta.\n\n&quot;Under Capricorn&quot; is a melodramatic romance by Alfred Hitchcock set in Australia in 1831, in the period of colonization of this great nation by convicts from the United Kingdom. The genre is unusual in the career of the master of suspense, but supported by magnificent cinematography and cast, highlighting Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotton, Michael Wilding and Margaret Leighton in a small but very important role. This film is not among my favorite Hitchcock&apos;s films and could be shorter. However, it is worthwhile watching it to see some aspects to the colonization of Australia. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Sob o Signo de Capric√≥rnio&quot; (&quot;Under the Capricorn Sign&quot;)\n\nNote: On 30 October 2024, I saw this film again.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (1968) is one of my favorite Bergman&apos;s films. I place it close to &quot;Persona&quot; to which it is a perfect matching piece. This impressive and disturbing movie about the loss of sanity by a tormented artist is another magnificent work of Ingmar Bergman, the closest to the horror genre he ever directed with his regular actors, Max von Sydow who is amazing as Johan and his Muse Liv Ullmann who is equally compelling as Alma, Jonah&apos;s wife. The film takes place on an isolated, windy island where Johan and pregnant Alma moved in hope for Johan to work on his paintings and where he is haunted by nightmares from the past that may or may not be just his dreams. They come to torture him during The Hour of the Wolf which Bergman describes as &quot;the hour between night and dawn. It is the hour when most people die, when sleep is deepest, when nightmares are more real. It is the hour when the sleepless are haunted by their deepest fear, when ghosts and demons are most powerful. The Hour of the Wolf is also the hour when most children are born.&quot;\n\nBergman has always been obsessed and fascinated by the inner demons that imagination can create and like no other filmmaker has explored the deepest mysteries of human soul and mind. \n\nSurrealistic, Gothic and dark horror film, with its magnificent black and white cinematography provided by Bergman&apos;s long time friend and collaborator, Sven Nykvist, &quot;The Hour of the Wolf&quot; is a frightening view of the mind of a mad person. \n\nIt&apos;s been mentioned in more than one comment and I agree that David Lynch might have seen &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; more than once and was influenced by it when working on his own dark and surrealistic &quot;Erazerhead&quot;.\n\n9.5/10",

From the director of &apos;Woochi&apos; and &apos;Assassination&apos;, though it came between them and I&apos;m seeing it now since I liked them both. An international cast film, I mean some well known Korean and Hong Kong actors in this multi-starrer. The story of two thief gangs joins hands to steal a diamond necklace in a casino in Macau. It&apos;s a team work, everyone is assigned to do their part, but due to some old incidents, they lose trust on one another. Followed by betrayal, how the heist takes place and what happens to them comes in the final quarter.\n\nThe actors were good, but their roles were so usual. At least the story looked better, but too much drag in the first half. Once their work begins to take off, the narration with those stunt sequences gets interesting. Even though I felt it should have been better, the screenplay should have kept tight. With so many characters, too many twists. So feels like it all jammed, though none of them were stunning enough, particularly a theme like this needed one that. I have seen a better heist film, I bet did as well, so this film won&apos;t surprise, but okay for watching once.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie about a year ago before a movie I watched last summer and thought it looked very promising. A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.\n\nI didn&apos;t go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I&apos;d hate to think he&apos;s be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.\n\nOne of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I&apos;m talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn&apos;t feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell &quot;NO!&quot; when things don&apos;t go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn&apos;t the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.",

His problems intensify when he comes across the body of a man which means the Comanche tribe are on the war path and with a return to Largo not an option he has to trek through hostile territory on foot . He spots a homestead and tries to steal a horse \n\nAs someone who is not a fan of the Western genre I only watched FORT DOBBS because there was nothing else on but found myself enjoying the movie much more than I could possibly have expected . One reason for this is because it resembles the type of story that would attract a director like Walter Hill who made a career out of reworking Anabasis by the ancient Greek writer Xenophon which involves protagonists trying to reach sanctuary through hostile territory and this film makes the best of the scenario and just when the protagonists think safety is in sight another obstacle appears \n\nPerhaps even stranger as someone who isn&apos;t keen on Westerns I did notice the genre conventions which could be interpreted as clich√©s were are the fore such as a man&apos;s got to do what a man&apos;s got to do , men in white hats against men in black hats and the Injuns are portrayed as violent savages . We even have a kid in the mix but none of this harms the movie probably because it&apos;s an involving and exciting tale . One flaw to it is that it&apos;s filmed in black and white and one thinks if you&apos;re to set a film in a vast landscape which is to all intents and purposes a co-star then the film would have worked even better if it was shot in colour",

      "reviewBody": "Quiet thriller with great acting from Meryl Streep, taken a slightly different route with the paranoid performance from Roy Schnieder. Unfortunately some other of the other performances are quite poor, with the standard dumbed down cops. Slow to pick up, it&apos;s worth sticking with past the stock plot setup routines. There&apos;s some neat camera work to strengthen the guessing game and make you feel the paranoia and fear of the doctor. There&apos;s a fantastic sequence in central park where the Doctor follows a mystery woman, losing her beneath the light \\ dark pools of street lights. Using the sound of her footsteps to pull your attention forward to a tunnel. The final moments of that sequence are brilliant. Throughout the lighting is used to great effect with all other senses and even performances extremely restrained. A good film which I&apos;m sure has influenced many others of this genre.",

Lett&apos;s (who would later become a member of Big Audio Dynamite) shot this movie on Super8mm. He was friends with many of the punk bands because he was their reggae connection (there was an interesting punk/reggae connection in London during that time). The footage of the Sex Pistols is priceless and worth the price of the tape itself. The Clash and the other major players are featured in this documentary. An interesting watch. I also recommend U.K. Decay as a follow up.\n\nBe on the look out for a young Shane Mac Gowan (The Pogues). He was a huge punk back in the late seventies before he re-invented himself as a hard edged Irish folk musician. He went on to combine the two elements and create a new sound.\n\nHighly recommended!",

If for no other reason, it&apos;s worth a look for big names such as Christopher Walken (in one of the lead roles), full Aerosmith, James Hong, Heather Locklear, Heather Locklear, and Charlton Heston.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Whether you love this movie or not, you have to admire this movie for two reasons. First, its return on the dollar was among the best ever for any film. While the budget was a very modest $777,777.111 (no kidding), it returned $115,000,000 in the United States alone! No wonder this film made George Lucas famous. Second, it was very innovative. While I was not a huge fan of the film&apos;s style, it was unique and sure had an impact on the world as well as future films. No one had made a film like this before--chock full of one song after another blaring across the soundtrack and its odd semi-structureless plot was also quite unique.\n\nThe film concerns a bunch of young adults just hanging out and cruising. There really isn&apos;t a lot more to it than that. Sure, their stories all reveal a bit about them through the course of the film, but most of the characters have no great depth. It&apos;s more like you are a voyeur watching some likable and not especially likable kids doing...well...nothing. Now if you grew up in the early 60s and remember all this, then it&apos;s a great stroll down memory lane. If you didn&apos;t, I think the movie will be more of a tough sell, as the nostalgia angle is non-existent. As for me, I wasn&apos;t even born until 1964, so the nostalgia aspect was less--but I loved the music and great cars. My daughter, while less impressed about EVERYTHING did grudgingly say that the music was great. She also said that she pretty much ignored the plot and just listened to the songs! And, perhaps, this is pretty typical of a person from her generation. As for me, the film was mildly interesting and I respect it--though I did not love it. This isn&apos;t really meant as a criticism--just a statement about how this film appealed to this 47 year-old guy. For the right audience, it&apos;s the perfect film. Otherwise, you might feels it&apos;s all a bit overrated.\n\nAside from the nostalgia for the early 60s, the movie also is quite interesting when seen today because so many future stars and super-stars are in it--mostly when they were young unknowns. Ron Howard (a child star but not all that popular yet as an adult), Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Charles Martin Smith, Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers all appear in the film.",

I happened to find this movie online and decided to give it a try mainly because it was on of the films that inspired Quentin Tarantino. Sleezy/Blaxploitation 70s movie reportedly made for $25,000, it takes you for a ride along with bounty hunter Zachary Kane through the underbelly of Los Angeles looking for a serial killer. It&apos;s not nearly as good or well-produced as others in this genre, but it&apos;s still worth watching if for no other reason than seeing Sherry wearing only a boyfriend shirt.",

The horrors of war and the way it affects civilians is shown in this movie and it won&apos;t leave you untouched. But even in the most serious situations there is room for jokes and you will alternate between crying and laughing.\n\nThis is one of the strongest movies I&apos;ve seen! I&apos;ve never admired any director or even known that they were alive until yesterday when I saw Zozo. With three great movies (this one is the best) Joseph Fares has shown that he truly masters the art of telling a story.\n\nI sincerely hope this movie is translated into English and other languages and if it doesn&apos;t get nominated for best foreign movie something is not right.\n\nDon&apos;t miss this movie!",

      "reviewBody": "This is about the quality you&apos;d expect from a TV pilot film ¬ñ even one that received a theatrical release ¬ñ which means that, for most of us, it&apos;s pretty dull viewing. A past-his-sell-by-date Hugh O&apos;Brian plays Jim Sinclair a brawny Texan cowboy clad in white and with a Native American sidekick (Tom Nardini) to prove just what a decent, honourable chap he is. That doesn&apos;t prevent him from nicking Adrienne Corri from her stiff-lipped fianc√©e without a moment&apos;s hesitation, however. Sinclair also takes Samson, an orphaned black boy under his wing. Samson, of course, is Africa, a vulnerable waif in need of guidance and aid; he&apos;s cute as a button, but serves no real purpose other than to pad out the running time which, at 109 minutes is about 108 minutes longer than it really needs to be. John Mills obviously fancied a holiday in the sun back in &apos;67, because there&apos;s clearly nothing about this project in terms of artistic or creative merit that could have attracted him, and his character, like little Samson&apos;s, serves no real purpose other than to admire Sinclair. He even manages to bag a freebie for daughter Hayley by having her make a 30-second cameo appearance in the first five minutes, the sly old dog. Only Nigel Green as a bullish Saird-Efrikan adds any kind of spark to the proceedings, but he isn&apos;t on screen long enough to redeem this dud.",

Far Off Place takes what was an amazing little-known film and moves it to Africa, adds a corny love interest, and of course includes some evil villains in an attempt to update the film for a wider audience.  Gabo, the African guide, tells the characters &quot;Don&apos;t look back&quot; - well, Gabo &quot;Don&apos;t look in the first place.&quot; Unless of course you promise to watch Walkabout, too."

      "reviewBody": "With &quot;Codename: Jackal&quot; (aka &quot;Jakali onda&quot;) being a South Korean action comedy, I had all the persuasion that I needed in order to take the time to sit down and watch the movie. Especially because South Korea usually make some very impressive movies in general.\n\nHowever, it turned out that writer Sang-ho Oh had created a story that was somewhat slow paced, and having a fairly bland character gallery really didn&apos;t help to promote the movie in any way. And director Hyeong-jun Bae didn&apos;t really manage to procure a very satisfactory result in transferring the script to screen.\n\nI found the storyline to be incredibly slow paced to the point where I was fast losing interest in the movie, both character-wise and story-wise. And it was a real struggle to keep having focus on the movie and find the will to continue with the movie to the very end. Running at 1 hour and 47 minutes, the pacing of the movie made it seem like it was 3 or 4 hours. Yeah, it was that dull and slow.\n\nIt should be said that the actors and actresses in the movie were actually doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, but it is so obvious that they are restricted by having next to nothing to work with in terms of script and character development. And it didn&apos;t really help that the characters were essentially all characters that have no appeal and are characters that the audience don&apos;t have any empathy towards.\n\n&quot;Operation: Jackal&quot; is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to for a second time around, even with my extended love for the South Korean cinema, because it just didn&apos;t prove to be particularly interesting, entertaining or funny.",

      "name": "A film which justifies its status as a major classic.",
      "reviewBody": "It must be over 50 years since I first saw this classic film, and for some reason I never watched it again until recently. To do so was an interesting experience - reliving many memories of the war years which I mostly spent in London. I think the reason why there was such a long interval before I decided to watch it again was a subconscious recognition that it was produced at a time of crisis, largely for political reasons, and a feeling this was unduly evident in the screenplay. Mrs. Miniver was released a few months after Pearl Harbour, at a time when many U.S. citizens wondered why their country should be expending its efforts fighting in Europe when it was Japan which had attacked them  The film was quite clearly written, produced and directed with the objective of answering this question. Winston Churchill has made it clear that he regarded the release of this film as one of the biggest single contributions made to the allied war effort (worth, in his words, &quot;a flotilla of destroyers&quot;), and it is hard today not to regard the film as primarily a piece of patriotic propaganda. However the deft and capable direction of William Wyler and the almost uniformly great acting by the cast, particularly Greer Garson as Mrs. Miniver, go a very long way towards concealing the fact that one is viewing a film with a message and few would deny that the Oscars it won were thoroughly deserved. Mrs. Miniver certainly earns its place on any short list of film classics.\n\n\tThere are of course already many comments on this film in the database, I would have been reluctant to add any more but for the realization that people of my age who lived in England during the war are becoming increasingly few, and our comments - which must have a rather different perspective to those of younger generations - will not continue to be available for very much longer. Many of the very fine sequences in this film have already been reviewed more than adequately by others and I will not comment further on them; but two sequences which I found particularly evocative were the call on amateur sailors to help evacuate the British army from Dieppe, and the pub scene where the locals were listening to the British traitor Lord Haw Haw broadcasting from Germany and telling his listeners how futile any further resistance would be. In stating this, I am simply confirming that for such documentary type films people who lived through the events depicted will assess the film on the basis of their personal memories rather than on their cinematographic quality. \n\n \tUltimately, both on its first viewing and when viewing it again a few days ago, I found that for me watching Mrs. Miniver was irritating because it inevitably showed an American view of life as it was in England. Numerous very small points indicated that we were seeing a glimpse of middle class English life through American eyes. Whilst as an English born viewer I found this irritating, it did not in any way detract from the primary purpose of the film in showing Americans what life in wartime Britain was really like, and why their involvement in the war in Europe was so vital. Ultimately I had to accept that this was a great film which well deserves its classic status.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot; is an inspirational melodrama directed by Marc Forster and starring Gerard Butler, Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon. This film is based on the true story of Sam Childers a former gang biker who finds god, becomes a pastor and has dedicated his life and all his resources ever since to rescuing and protecting orphans in Sudan, Africa. Childers founded Angles of East Africa an orphanage located in South Sudan.\n\nMarc Forster has under his belt an impressive resume with films like Quantum of Solace, The Kite Runner, Finding Neverland and Monster&apos;s Ball. \n\nReviewing this film has been very complicated because of its subject matter. The movie has a strong religious subject, addresses the civil conflict and severity of the crisis in Sudan, ideals, hypocrisy and religious fanaticism. This film will divide Christian audiences because of the redemptive arc of the tale.\n\nThis is one of those movies that will provoke both sympathy and aversion. Sam Childers (Butler) is not an ordinary preacher; he carries a machine gun and kills LRA rebels in self-defense looking at it as helping God&apos;s children. Sam had a troubled life, was a gang member, drug dealer, junkie, married a stripper, but his life dramatically changes around when he finds god or god finds him, as he states in the movie. He claims to be a soldier fighting for freedom and becomes a member of the SPLA (Sudan People&apos;s Liberation Army). \n\nMark Foster does a good job bringing such a complex and controversial story to the big screen utilizing his well-known visual skills. This movie has a lot of graphic and violent scenes, showing the horror caused by a civil war, torture, savage murders, and how entire villages are destroyed. \n\nMPAA rating: R Runtime: 2:03 mins Production Co: Relativity Media, Virgin Produced, Apparatus Productions",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, Danny Draven is a very good director...only 23 years old...anyway--\n\nLike most reviews I have read about this movie...I also felt it ended too quickly.  This movie was actually building up to be something...The story line about technology destroying mankind, was getting good...then a 2 minute show down at the end killed the whole thing.\n\nToo many Matrix overtones, I feel, also killed the movie.  It was good, but it was &quot;borrowing&quot; too much from The Matrix...However, I really did like the creatures in this movie.  Wetwire and Manifesto were excellent costumes, that didn&apos;t look as dull as most of Full Moon&apos;s recent stuff does.  I would really like to see the director, Danny Draven redo this movie with about 5 million dollars (instead of the maybe $200,000 or less he did for this).  I think he is good director, and young...that is a good thing in hollywood. I just hope that Full Moon doesn&apos;t keep their hooks in him too long..I hope he is really discovered.  JR Bookwalter did an excellent job recommending Draven to direct....\n\nAt maybe 70 mins long, this movie really relied on alot of Padding to get it thru those 70 mins...listening to the commentary on the DVD, we learn that there were several other scenes intended for the movie, but were not made because of budgetary retraints....\n\nCharlie Band: Please, I beg you instead of the insane notion to make 40 movie a year...Please double and triple the budgets on movies with a good idea...This would have been alot better with more money....\n\n7 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "Shaheed (1948) : Brief Review -\n\nA tragic romance and patriotic drama amidst the freedom fight era. The film begins in the 1920s as we see three kids, Ram, Sheila, and Vinod. Ram wants to be Nehru, Sheila wants to be Kamla Nehru, and Vinod wants to become a police officer in the British Force. Ram and Sheila are always together; they beat Vinod, who happens to be a bad guy from the beginning. Grown up, Ram has become a freedom fighter and Sheila has become a doctor. The film is about their romance and the sacrifices they have to make for the country and for their loved ones. Vinod is a police officer in a British camp, and he is chasing Ram to hang him. Sheila is forced to marry Vinod to save her brother and Ram, but Ram mistakes her sacrifice for betrayal. The conflicts get solved later, but by that time, Ram has become too big, and Sheila has nothing left to live. Shaheed openly speaks about the differences between Gandhivaad and extremists, violence and non-violence, patriotism and treachery. I couldn&apos;t overlook the big flaw of Ram becoming a violent leader after following Nehru Ji&apos;s ideology. This was exactly opposite to what his views were about the freedom fight. He was more into the Bhagat Singh zone than Gandhi or Nehru. Maybe the writer and the director wanted to play safe and not hot the feelings of Indians who were enjoying the newly brought freedom. Dilip Kumar plays Ram, an honest patriot who would do anything for his country, and his portrayal is so good. But I&apos;d like to give a big shout out to Kamini Kaushal, who played Sheil, a doctor who made more sacrifices than many freedom fighters in the film. Chandra Mohan&apos;s last major role was superb. A sudden change in a father was illogical, but pretty okay for the 40s. The music could have been better, as the film lacks a patriotic chartbuster. The opening song was good, though. Ramesh Saigal was a true patriot, I believe, because he made such films (Shaheed, Samadhi) that were needed at that time.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "As you might expect from an attempt to re run a beloved classic there is a certain air of somewhat cynical box checking about The Railway Children Return but some charm does manage to sneak through.\n\nThis time round children are sent to the country to escape the blitz rather than just having to slum it with the yokels because daddy has legal problems. This set up allows Jenny Agutter to return as the grown up matriarch of a family taking in the new generation of railway kids. She seems to be enjoying herself but doesn&apos;t really have much to do. This is the same for most of the adult characters in the film, thinly drawn but likeable (apart from one insufferable old uncle who turns up purely to spout ra ra nonsense).\n\nThis makes sense as it is the railway &quot;children&quot; after all. Some of the child acting is, to be kind, a mixed bag but it never derails proceedings and there is only so much a young actor can do with insightful lines like, &quot;I hate war, I hate it!&quot;\n\nThe plot, such as it is, involves a runaway soldier and institutional racism. Fortunately, only the American military are racist (although they still promote black soldiers far up the ranks so i guess we are meant to think they aren&apos;t all bad) as the citizens of a quant English village would never indulge in such behaviour. To call the events of the movie a plot is actually a bit of stretch, things happen for a while and then just sort of resovle themselves without much explanation of how everynody came together.\n\nThe Railway Children Return isnt a complete waste of time but is likely to be quickly forgotten. Probably as soon as the credits roll.",

But all he sees is something that looks like a button in the wall.. when he presses it, hundreds of naked angel-boys appear before him, only to disappear back into the wall..except their penises! He then proceeds to press the penises, and finds out that something mysterious happens every time he does so! Holes open in the walls, and random things are thrown into the room, be it furniture, gadgets, food, or even living things! All that happens inside the room is apparently a personal voyage for the man, but it also effects other people&apos;s lives at the same time, most notably the Mexican wrestler and his family, which we discover near the end of the film. But it really is something that should be watched to be completely understood - and even then, it&apos;s not even certain that you&apos;ll be able to understand what happened - or why.\n\nHighly recommended film. Very unique and entertaining throughout, even though the last fifteen minutes get really bizarre and too artsy for my taste. This movie is not to be missed. You will probably never see anything quite as weird and funny like this. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; is a necessity to understand film history in the USA. From the earliest days of cinema (a rare clip of an 1895 Thomas Edison experimental film shows two men dancing in an embrace!) up to the modern era, this film details how gays were depicted in the cinema (from the sissy fashion designer to the bull-dyke prison guard) and the problems film-makers had to deal with due to the restrictions of the Hayes Office and the self-proclaimed Legion of Decency.\n\nAn incredible piece of cinematic history shown in the film is the (now restored) &quot;oysters and snails&quot; scene in &quot;Sparticus&quot;, where Marcus Licinius (Sir Laurence Olivier) tries to seduce his slave Antonius (Tony Curtis) in the bath.\n\nThis documentary changed the way I look at cinema, and now I often find myself seeking for the &quot;hidden messages&quot; in the characterization (&quot;Calamity Jane&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot;...I can never see the scene where Judah and Mesalla drink that wine and glance into each other&apos;s eyes the same way again!). My only complaint is that the film does not mention the 1919 German silent film &quot;Anders als die Anderen&quot; (&quot;Different From the Others&quot;), one of the first to seriously deal with homosexuality.\n\nMarvelous film! (To the film-makers: k.d. lang singing &quot;(Once I Had A) Secret Love&quot; at the end is a crowning touch!)"

Where&apos;s Clarence when he really needs him?!? Seriously though, Jimmy does a good job. He&apos;s not the best singer but he can carry a tune. If you like pretty movie stars, this one&apos;s the picture for you -- Eleanor Powell, Virginia Bruce, Una Merkel, Frances Langford are all beauties. Powell is the star of the show with her awesome tap dancing numbers. Keep your eyes peeled for Dennis O&apos;Keefe in Powell&apos;s first number. He&apos;s the guy she taps on the shoulder. Una Merkel is perfection as always. Buddy Ebsen singing and dancing is a hoot. Sid Silvers and Raymond Walburn are funny comic relief. Adorable Juanita Quigley plays Una &amp; Sid&apos;s daughter.\n\nIt&apos;s a slight but fun story with a killer cast. Outstanding Cole Porter songs include classics &quot;Easy to Love&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve Got You Under My Skin.&quot; But my personal favorites are &quot; Hey, Babe, Hey&quot; and &quot;Swingin&apos; the Jinx Away.&quot; As always, Eleanor Powell&apos;s dancing is spectacular. Add some nice humor and the immense likability of Powell and Stewart and you have a real gem. Get this on DVD or catch it on TCM next time they show it.",

The writing is full of funny one liners, maybe one to many, but hey, it&apos;s a social comedy (dixit Koen De Bouw. Expect some laughs, even some the scriptwriter didn&apos;t intend. I enjoyed this movie, but it was very hard to overcome the very irritating cheap keyboard music by Fonny De Wulf.

Anna Thomson&apos;s portrayal of a mentally ill women decompensating and becoming increasingly dysfunctional was the truest depiction of mental illness I have ever seen on film. I&apos;m not going to guess at a diagnosis, whether she is a borderline personality disorder, schizophrenic, or schizoaffective disorder, but Anna Thompson nailed it. They key to her performance was her ambivalent affect. So many portrayals of the mentally get it so wrong. As a retired nurse of forty two years I remember my instructor telling me that ambivalence was the number one symptom of mental illness. This is a cheap, sort of sleazy sad movie, but the lead actresses performance redeems it.",

The novelty of this approach wears off after about two minutes and it just gets more and more grating from that point in. It turns out the kid&apos;s into wrestling and he ends up sent to some kid&apos;s home run by an evil wrestler, but after an interminable period there&apos;s the lamest ending ever.

The stories start out &quot;realistic&quot;, but go crazy and fantastic by the minute. A nice concept, that I guess you could squeeze more out of ... maybe the next one will be better handled ...",

The third isn&apos;t special in any ways, but wants to be. He&apos;s very skinny, and there is nothing important about him. His relationship with his father is not very balanced: they diverge from each other in every possible way. But he&apos;s secretly planning something, from what he will be famous of... Nothing in Hungarian cinema&apos;s history can be compared to this. Not a single Hungarian movie was as violent as this one is sometimes. In some scene it reminded me of Pasolini&apos;s Salo. But the disgusting and the violent scenes are all meaningful; probably they are a perverse, misshapen mirror of the society. We can&apos;t say, that the leading characters are perverted, because everybody is as much perverted, as the ones we see. Fortunately this unique movie is presented by a big amount of humor - and we simply can&apos;t take the characters totally seriously. Taxidermia is a milestone in Hungarian film-making, and was worth every single cent of the Sundance money, from which it was made.",

A film made in the silent period, or even in the 1930s or 1950s, cannot possibly cater for the world of today, which moves at far greater speed, with verbal exchanges in real time across the globe - not to mention all the other differences since 1931.\n\nOne has to try to inhabit the movie&apos;s time in order to appreciate the high art of a DER MORDER DMITRI KARAMASOFF. 9/10.",

      "name": "A great reboot of the Kamen Rider franchise!",
      "reviewBody": "First of all, the negative review(s) you might read here definitely do not reflect the opinion of all die-hard fans of the classic Kamen Rider series. You can see that their review &apos;usefulness rating&apos; are very low anyway, meaning most people don&apos;t agree with their baseless reasons for bashing something new.\n\nI watched the original Kamen Rider series as a kid back in the 70s, and it was really good entertainment for the time. Rewatching these classics about 30 yrs later, I feel the nostalgia, but understandably not too impressed with the old fashion FX and fight choreography. So, pulling this franchise into the 21st century is a very good idea to me. I just couldn&apos;t get into the other &quot;Rider&quot; series because the story isn&apos;t about Hongo. And the Riders only look derivative of the original and therefore not as good.\n\nIt really brought back fond memories when the classic title theme was played at the beginning of The First. I totally love the introduction of Kamen Rider 1. Since the character is introduced during the night, the light-up eyes effect was an excellent idea! The use of CG effects in the movie was well...very effective. Some good examples include: when Kamen Rider 1 jumped off the building landing on the ground with all the broken window glass around him. Also when Kamen Rider 1 and 2 are fighting each other, the concrete busting punches and kicks are really powerful looking. These are not just eye candy FX but used very effectively to show the invincibility of these super-human characters.\n\nAs for the villains, the intricate wire-work was very well done. I especially liked the battle with &apos;The Spider&apos; where high-flying moves are done in conjunction with speeding motorcycles and among trees. The original series (if watched today) lacked some of these FX scenes to thoroughly convince me that Kamen Riders have any real special powers. Well, other than the big kick that ends the show every time. But for a youngster in the 70s, that was enough to keep me role-playing &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; endlessly with my friends during recess. One other cool idea in this new franchise: we can see that the &quot;grasshopper&quot; heads of the Riders after transforming is really just a helmet. They can take it off to reveal their real human faces. This allows the actors a much greater range of emotions while they are Riders. It also confirms for me that the Rider transformation is just changing into the suit, not changing into another being like Ultraman. For Kamen Rider, I rather like the idea that they are still human inside.\n\nOverall if you were a fan of the original, I think The First is a must see, but still good entertainment if you just happen to like superheroes and anime. I hope that I&apos;m not offending any fans of the other &apos;Rider&apos; series when I say that they&apos;re just not the same as Kamen Rider. But &quot;The First&quot; successfully captures that magic from the past, and relaunch it with modern film production values. 9/10",

      "name": "Great French-Italian steamy drama",
      "reviewBody": "In this heavy Jules Dassin drama, you&apos;re treated to an Italian landscape, an Italian-sounding plot, and two popular Italian actors...speaking French. This feels like an Italian movie, but it&apos;s in French, so if you like old European dramas, you&apos;re going to love this one.\n\nThe residents of a poor fishing village are controlled by the powerful Yves Montand. He&apos;s menacing, wealthy, and has enough influence to get what he wants by any measure. In the evenings, he plays a drinking game called &quot;The Law&quot; with the men of the town. Whoever is boss for the evening gets to say insulting things to anyone and force the players to humiliate themselves. While this game is the title of the movie, it&apos;s more of a symbolic title rather than being the main focus of the plot. Yves may make &quot;The Law&quot; in the evenings, but he also runs the town during the daytime.\n\nI&apos;ve never been impressed by Yves Montand, but I&apos;ve only ever seen him in movies where he was forced to speak English. Evidently, the language barrier greatly impeded his acting ability, because in La legge he was fantastic. I didn&apos;t even know it was him until halfway through the movie when I remembered who was in the opening credits. He was incredibly frightening, and it was clear he had a love of power and great hopes and dreams for his family. Great villains are not just evil, but they show the audience their motivation. Bravo, and please accept my apology, M. Montand.\n\nThe concurrent plot in The Law is Gina Lollobrigida&apos;s own power over the men in the town, similar to Yves&apos;s control. She can drive a man to madness because her tight dresses and sensual movements make him half-crazed, but in her great power, none of the men who desire her ever force themselves on her. She may not be a frightening force in the town, but she has just as much power. While Yves has his mind set on seducing Gina, she has her heart set on marrying Marcello Mastroianni. This is a pretty racy movie for its time, with love scenes that undoubtedly made Will Hays of the Production Code blush. There&apos;s violence, incestuous themes, infidelity, and enough tight dresses to make you forget all about Sophia Loren. Seriously, folks. Gina is so beautiful and distracting in this movie, it&apos;s a wonder any other Italian actress ever became popular. And she speaks three languages! Marcello&apos;s French accent is also very good, so if you want to see these talented linguists, you&apos;ll be in for an extremely entertaining and steamy movie night.\n\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual content and violence, I wouldn&apos;t let my kids watch it.\n\nDLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. A couple of minutes before the end, after Melina Mercouri asks for a drink, there&apos;s an abrupt camera spin and it will make you sick. In other words, &quot;Don&apos;t Look, Mom!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I picked this up on a lark because the cover was three hot Japanese babes, and the flick was directed by the same guy behind Ghost in the Shell. For a bargain bin find, it was well worth it.\n\nI&apos;ll say straight away, if you&apos;re not into hard sci fi (especially written hard sci fi), you&apos;re probably going to find it dragging and dull, and you&apos;re going to hate the intro.\n\nIf you don&apos;t really like Japanese movies/anime/manga, you might struggle to like this film. If this is your first Japanese movie, put it down, and go pick up Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children instead, it has a more universal appeal, and fewer long scenes that don&apos;t advance the plot.\n\nThe basic plot: The world had some big problems, there was a big economic collapse, wars, stuff like that. Afterward, the world fell into a kind of dark ages where everything (technology especially) stagnated. People were no longer satisfied with their lives in the false utopia that followed all the problems. A lot of them found an outlet for their most basic human emotional needs in a video game named Avalon. This movie follows a group of players in a second imagining of Avalon, named Avalon-F, which is basically a MMO/Hunting game on steroids. The characters all start off trying to solo a big boss, which the game informs them is not really possible. However, the gamers are stubborn and want the glory/advancement for themselves, and it takes them a while to come around to working together. The movie is about them finally coming to the decision to work together, and the struggles, internal and external they go through in the process.\n\nThere are lots of long, pretty shots where you don&apos;t see anything that advances the story in a meaningful way, just gives you things to think about. I enjoyed it, I like meandering around in video games and exploring my surroundings, so for a movie about a video game to do that was fun for me. That said, if you&apos;re a passive viewer who doesn&apos;t like sitting around waiting for action to happen, this movie is not for you.\n\nI loved the costume design. Lucifer in particular was great. She appears to have feathers for hair, which will make sense if you keep watching. I love the personal moments that show this character having fun, she&apos;s a pretty character, and looks like she really enjoys herself in this virtual world. She finds unexpected ways to have fun, considering the premise of the video game she&apos;s playing.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this movie comes from the choice of having the actors wear masks, but not recording their voices in a recording studio later. It makes their speech very hard to follow because it&apos;s muffled all the time. Movie making 101 should have told the director not to make that mistake.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s a good movie, and it hits all the right points for me. If you can pick it up cheap and like sci fi and Japanese movies, go for it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was a real positive surprise. It felt both original and well done. Simply a real good movie to watch.\n\nIt&apos;s perhaps hard to place this movie in any particular genre. Psychological-horror would be the best way to describe this movie. It plays on the deep rooted fears of people but please don&apos;t expect from this movie to give you plenty of scare moments, or anything of that sort. It&apos;s not really an horror in the classic most common sense of the word. The drama plays an important part as well, which only strengthens the movie its psychological-horror aspects. In that regard alone this movie already works out as an original and interesting one.\n\nBut above all things, it&apos;s also a really well done film. It has a good build up and narrative, some fine actors and the movie has a good look over it as well. It&apos;s not a big budget movie that had a big cinematic release anywhere but you can&apos;t really tell that, judging by the movie its looks or just overall greatness. Actually hard to believe that this was the first ever movie for director Anthony DiBlasi, who was also rumored to direct the new Hellraiser movie for a while. He would had certainly been capable of it and he had worked with Clive Barker, the creator of the Hellraiser franchise, before, which was on this movie actually, that got based on a short story by Clive Barker. His approach of the horror and more serious story aspects, which he shows that he is capable off with this movie, would had been great for a new Hellraiser movie.\n\nThe movie has a story that steadily but slowly progresses. Yet the movie becomes never a boring or dragging one because it is capable of getting you involved with the characters and their stories. It&apos;s a real intriguing movie to watch and because it&apos;s being so original, you also can&apos;t really predict all the time what is going to happen next in it. No, not everything works convincing or works out as strong and effective as it could had but still this movie feels like a breath a fresh air and is perfectly watchable.\n\nA nice, original, well done little film.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

L√©a Seydoux&apos;s sulky beauty makes her perfect for the role of Louise; Kacey Mottet Klein, then barely into his teens, gives an amazing performance as Simon. Didn&apos;t recognize Gillian Anderson as the Englishwoman who takes a motherly interest. The slangy (not to say skanky) dialogue may be useful to students of advanced conversational French. Ursula Meier&apos;s first feature, &quot;Home,&quot; is a total headtrip, longer on concept than plot and reminiscent of 50s absurdist satires of modern life by Ionesco and Jacques Tati; this one has real visceral impact. Both &quot;Sister&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; are available on streaming Netflix.",

China invites her former boyfriend, the wealth Mark (Zach Galligan), their friend Tony (Dana Ashbrook) and two other schoolmates to come to the museum, but the two last ones give-up.\n\nMark, China, Sarah and Tony are welcome by a dwarf and they separate in the room during the tour. Soon Tony crosses the security rope of the display and he finds in a cabin trapped with a werewolf. China also crosses the security rope of another display and she finds in a castle with several vampires. Tony and China are killed and become part of the exhibition. Mark and Sarah leave the museum and soon they find that their friends are going missing. Mark goes to the police but Inspector Roberts (Charles McCaughan) does not believe in his words. Mark and Sarah find in the attic of his mansion an old newspaper and they learn a dark secret about David Lincoln. They visit Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), who is a friend of Mark&apos;s family, and they learn that David is near to unleash evil on Earth.\n\n&quot;Waxwork&quot; is a funny and gore movie with an absurd story, silly dialogs, but also a cult movie. The Waxwork Museum mysteriously appears in town and soon teenagers, the police inspector and several people disappear in the wax museum, but nobody in the town seems to care. The 80&apos;s is a fertile period of horror movies and &quot;Waxwork&quot; is among my favorites. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Passagem&quot; (&quot;The Passage&quot;)\n\nNote: On 16 February 2021, I saw this film again.",

Although I haven&apos;t seen Yojimbo (pronounced Yo-Jimbo by one of the characters), but I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t be fair to all of them.\n\nThis movie is an action movie, with Van Damme as the good guy, but it&apos;s not very serious. Sure, there are explosions and guns and kicks and a completely unnecessary sex scene and all that, but it seems like there are quite a lot comic relief moments and characters. Pat Morita and Bill Erwin reminded me of Statler and Waldorf from The Muppets, for one.\n\nVan Damme plays an American, which meant that he talked very little and tried to talk in a raspy voice to disguise his accent. And you know what? It worked. The only thing that I couldn&apos;t let go is because I expected to hear his unique accent.\n\nThis movie is 95 minutes well spent. Don&apos;t go out of your way looking for it, but you don&apos;t have to avoid it either.",

It&apos;s a science fiction film, but it&apos;s not about killer robots, particularly; it&apos;s not about planets or star ships blowing up; it&apos;s not about aliens invading the earth. It&apos;s a quiet, sort of slow film, that seems to be about one thing and then turns out to be about something else. It&apos;s low budget but I don&apos;t think that is damaging in the least. The acting isn&apos;t bad - it&apos;s part of the story. In fact, I will watch for the actors in other work just to see how they do. The story, as I said, seems to be one thing, but then starts to twist and turn to an ending that is quite moving.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;m glad to have stumbled across this.",

      "reviewBody": "Strip nude for Your killer must be, for me, the most outrageously sexist giallo ever made. Fair enough, you&apos;ve got to expect a fair amount of it in these movies(or else you&apos;d be let down) but Andrea Bianchi runs with misogyny ball so far that he leaves the park, gets in a taxi with it, goes to the airport, and throws the ball on a plane to some uncharted island in the pacific.\n\nWhich, by the way, makes this film quite entertaining.\n\nAfter someone kills a doctor who&apos;s botched abortion killed his patient, the film shifts focus to a modelling agency and all the suspects/victims therein. Specifically, we get to focus on Magda (Edwige Fenech), a photographer...and Carlo, who is also a photographer. Carlo takes the biscuit as the most sexist Italian movie hero I&apos;ve laid eyes on. We first see him sexually harassing a young girl (and succeeding!), then he hooks up with Edwige, seemingly immediately moving in to her apartment, moaning about his coffee, and reading the paper while ignoring her. Edwige, for her part, doesn&apos;t seem to mind being called stupid, being shouted at, or even throttled. Ah, the innocence of young love.\n\nOh, and there&apos;s some murders too. Our motorcycle-helmeted killer starts working his way through the cast, and I won&apos;t really go into much detail about it as it&apos;s a giallo, but if you want to see an extremely fat man trying it on with a model, then this is the film for you. Our chicks are there for eye candy, except for the boss of the agency, so of course that makes her a lesbian.\n\nWeirdly, I expected LESS from the director of The Zombie Dead, but here, at least on a technical level, he seems to do a bit better. There&apos;s some nice Argento/Bava style cinematography, and the music is what you&apos;d expect. Violence wise it&apos;s touch and go, with some nice gore effects but not much carnage. However, clothes fly off without much prompting so you&apos;ve not got much to worry about there.\n\nFun stuff...not a top giallo, but I can&apos;t help but be impressed.\n\nAnd, as usual, the ending is jaw-droppingly stupid, and morally questionable.",

In the middle of this kink-fest is the dependably beautiful Edwige Fenech doing all she can to avoid being the next to shed her clothes for a killer who likes their victims easy on the eye and stripped for the kill.\r\n\r\nFrom the mind of √Ç‚ÄòBurial Ground&apos; director Andrea Bianchi comes a gloriously trashy movie riddled with unnecessary but very welcome top-drawer nudity and awash with neon red blood but most importantly a well-made film that delivers wave after wave of guilty exploitation pleasure.\r\n\r\nStrip Nude For Your Killer (cert. 18) is released uncut (for the first time in the UK) on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment.

      "reviewBody": "Finally, something new and fresh. This documentary needed to be made. It&apos;s very funny, scary, weird, touching and always interesting. Although the pace drags at times, it&apos;s entertaining and *gasp!* educational.\n\nI&apos;m no trekkie, I do enjoy the movies though. Although I can&apos;t relate to the trekkies featured here, one can&apos;t help but admire their devotion. Oh sure, we laugh when we see some klingon&apos;s going to a fast food restaurant, get a tad freaked out by a transvesite in a Starfleet uniform, and shake our heads at &quot;Spinerfems&quot;. But guess what, they aren&apos;t hurting anybody! In fact, from what I saw, local Trekkie chapters do a lot of good for their community. Klingons even visit children&apos;s hospitals!\n\nIs it weird to see someone in public wearing a phaser and a star fleet uniform? Yes, to so-called &apos;normal&apos; people. Yet it&apos;s considered perfectly acceptable for an armchair jock to wear major-league baseball caps and jerseys of their favorite players in public.  Hey, if a trekkie married couple has a succesful dental practice, do they need to &quot;get a life&quot;? Maybe the guy who spends his Sundays at the bar watching football all day needs to get one.\n\nHey, I laughed at it most of the time. I admit it. The candid interviews of some of the ex-cast members are a riot! And near the end of the video, there was one interview with a Radio-Shack-Trekkie (the worst kind, I think) where I could not stop laughing. I mean it, he was such a GEEK. But then, this guy has invented something useful, I haven&apos;t. There you go.",

The basic premise is simple: three college students go out for their friend&apos;s 21st birthday, and - shocker- the friend has to be back at his house for a med interview early the next morning. When he gets too drunk to find his house, the hilarity ensues (I wish). This movie could have been good, and I&apos;m not expecting Oscar-worthy here, but instead it was a re-hash of movies we&apos;ve all seen before. Now, I should also say that I didn&apos;t like Project X. However, since the writers from The Hangover were responsible for this movie I thought it would be a fun one to see. Afraid not. At least it was free. My recommendation? If you liked The Hangover, proceed with caution."

      "reviewBody": "I really don&apos;t know what some of the more snobbish reviewers expect when they sit down to watch movies such as this; &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;? Maybe &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;? How about something that was produced last year for tens of millions of dollars? These were films produced in the thirties and forties with a low budget, by studios who did not have access to special effects and high cost productions as the majors did. Still, the films are highly enjoyable with good plots and usually fine acting. They are gems and classics in their own way despite the financial shortcomings they had to endure. &quot;The Ape Man&quot; is such a movie. The great Bela Lugosi and a talented cast give us a good story and a fine movie. Bela&apos;s character has, unfortunately, made himself part ape. Alas, another scientific experiment gone awry. He needs a special &quot;spinal serum&quot; or return to 100% human ways and has to kill to get it. He does and, well, you&apos;ll have to see the film to find out what happens. This is not a movie to be ridiculed or laughed at, but to be enjoyed. &quot;The Ape Man&quot; is a classic to those who enjoy these type of films."

Widmark, fresh from his career-making role of Tommy Udo, plays Jefty, who owns a road house. His friend from the service, Wilde, runs the place. Jefty is gone on Lily (Lupino) but can&apos;t get to first base and hires her as a singer. Unfortunately, she falls for Pete. Jefty frames Pete for robbery to keep him and Lily from leaving town to get married, and then arranges with the judge to have Pete paroled to him. To say he&apos;s up to something is an understatement.\n\nThe revelation here is Lupino as a sexy torch singer. She does her own singing here, husky, seductive, very stylized and smoking. She&apos;s wonderful. Widmark is vicious as only Widmark could be, and Wilde repeats his &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; nice guy as victim role. Celeste Holm looks great and does her usual excellent job as a woman attracted to Pete who takes pity on him and Lily just the same.\n\nMy only criticism is that there is a scene where Lily turns on the radio to a classical station where a soprano is singing &quot;Einsam im Truben Tagen.&quot; She tells Pete that she studied opera, and her father had great ambition for her. With that whiskey and cigarette soaked set of vocal cords - I doubt it.",

      "reviewBody": "The New Kids is probably best for fans of the cast or anyone satisfied by mediocre teen 80s movies. This is one of those movies about a bunch of psychotic weirdos trying to do as much damage as possible to two innocent victims, leaving you to wonder what the heck these kids did to push the antagonists so far over the edge.\n\nHere, our innocent victims are Abby (Lori Laughlin) and Loren (Shannon Presby). After their parents died, the brother and sister go to live in an amusement park (how awesome is that?) where their relatives (surrogate parent-types) live and work.\n\nThe psychos are led by Eddie Dutra (James Spader) a sadistic albino, and his gang of merry men (one of which is the excellent John Philbin who 80s fans will remember as &apos;Turtle&apos; from the surf adventure, North Shore). Anyways, Eddie wants Abby, and what Eddie wants, he gets. But when Abby pushes him away after several forceful advances, sadistic control-freak Eddie doesn&apos;t want it to look like he let a girl weaken him. He and the gang go after Lorren, Abby, and their family, in a do or die situation.\n\n Despite having a decent finale of chases and destruction, the movie has a very simple story. Unfortunately, it can also be quite sappy during those brother-sister inspiration talks. Abby and Lorren are willing to fight back against Eddie and his gang once and for all after so many of his vicious acts against them and their family, but for such tough kids (especially Abby), they do seem to come off as bitterly sappy sometimes.\n\n Unfortunately, too, the movie has a very simple story. I watched it on the Spanish Channel (I don&apos;t understand Spanish) and I figured everything out alright. It&apos;s a generic story, but one you&apos;ll like if that&apos;s what you&apos;re into or if you&apos;re fans of the actors in this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Sitting down to watch this movie, I knew that I was in for some kind of children&apos;s movie, but &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot; proved to be so much more than just that.\n\nI am not familiar with the written work of Beverly Cleary that this movie is based on, so I cannot draw any comparisons or say what differs from the books and what is true to it, so I will not deal with this matter.\n\nThe story deals with multiple story lines and does so in a good way. Of course, you have the lead character, little Ramona Quimby (played by Joey King) who has a very colorful imagination and seem to always be in the spotlight for often not so good things. So the movie deals with her life and her view of the world, and it expresses this in a very good way. And that is of course very well helped along the way by a very charismatic, adorable and good acting Joey King.\n\nThen there is the whole family aspect to the story, and that is one of the supporting foundations of the movie as well, and it gets around to deal with a number of elements in family life, and again does so in a good way. Carried by the excellent cast and the storyline in general. The roles of Ramona and Beezus&apos; mom and dad were played by Bridget Moynahan and John Corbett. Again, two actors who put on very believable performances in the movie.\n\nAnd of course there is a love story element to the story, well two of them actually, the love story between aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Hobart (Josh Duhamel), and the teenage love romance between Beezus (Selena Gomez) and Henry (Hutch Dano). Both of these love stories are nicely told also, and you do believe in them in the way they are portrayed. And again, all four actors/actresses here did a good job with their roles.\n\nThere are so many elements that play through the movie and they all work well together and come full circle throughout the movie in a very satisfying and wholesome way.\n\nDo not, like I did, write this movie off as some sappy family movie for the kids, because it honestly is much more than just that. With hand on heart, I am glad that I sat down to watch this movie, because it is an uplifting experience for the spirit and the heart. This movie is intended as wholesome entertainment for the family and it delivers right on. I think this is the type of movie that will stay with you for a long time, because it just makes you feel happy and put you in a good mood.\n\nI highly recommend this movie if you need a break from the stress of daily life and want to sit down and unwind with an uplifting story. This movie is suitable for children and adults alike, both male and female.\n\nOh, and the cat, Picky Picky, was so cute and adorable. And he looks quite a lot like my own cat! haha...\n\nThumbs way up for this heartwarming movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has three stories which are skillfully merged together at the end. One story is about a determined detective who is searching for a murderer. The second story is about a composer with social aspirations who is preparing to perform the debut of his piano concerto. I won&apos;t spoil it by describing the third story which is a flashback 30 years into the past. The third story has very little dialog and shows what silent movie fans have always known: you don&apos;t need much dialog to tell a good story.\n\nThe English subtitling on the dvd version I saw is not great, but passable. As a minor quibble, the subtitles are not present to translate written documents when a newspaper article or arrest warrant is shown on the screen.\n\nThere are some nice visual scenes which are quite effective. I last saw this movie in the 1970&apos;s and although I forgot the movie title, I never forgot the scene where the two detectives ride silently on their way to arrest the murderer. When I viewed this movie again recently, I was surprised to see how brief this scene actually is."

      "reviewBody": "Leslie Howard stars in &quot;Berkeley Square,&quot; also starring Heather Angel.\n\nHoward plays Peter Standish, who is fascinated by all the material he finds in his house from his 18th century ancestors, 146 years earlier. He believes that if he wants to, he can go back to that time. This film is the predecessor to many time travel films, including Somewhere in Time.\n\nHis ancestor, also Peter Standish, visited his house from America on a particular date. Peter changes places with him on that date in the present.\n\nAt first, all is well; then he starts slipping and speaking of things in the future to the extent that people begin to believe he is possessed b the devil. The only person who senses the real Peter is Helen Pettigrew (Heather Angel) a Standish cousin. He and Helen fall in love, and she is able to see the future through his eyes -- war, weapons of destruction, neon lights, cars - it all terrifies her. This is the best sequence in the film.\n\nHelen cannot go into the future with him -- and doesn&apos;t want to, given what she&apos;s seen -- and he&apos;s a pariah, and will make her one, if he stays.\n\nThis is a charming film badly in need of restoration. Leslie Howard is perfect as Peter -- handsome, ethereal, and well-suited to the period aspects. Heather Angel, whom I&apos;ve just gotten to know in the Bulldog Drummond series, is delightful, petite and pretty with a soothing voice and a fragility that lends itself well to the role.\n\nBerkeley Square was remade in 1951 as &quot;I&apos;ll Never Forget You,&quot; starring Tyrone Power, which has a less sober ending - before it was released on DVD, it was in the TCM website&apos;s top ten of most requested films to be released as a DVD. There&apos;s something appealing about time travel - otherwise, there wouldn&apos;t be so many films about it. But there&apos;s also something appealing and modern about the premise of Berkeley Square - that all time runs parallel and is all happening at once. Quantum physics would agree that this is so.",

      "reviewBody": "High camp and high neuroses in the same picture.\n\nIf you get everything you ever wanted, you still aren&apos;t satisfied because your own fantasies can never be truly fulfilled in the real world. It&apos;s kind of what Woody Allen is saying by making this movie into a goofy musical. It&apos;s his own fantasy of what movies used to be like, but can&apos;t ever be anymore. The small touches of realism, like the grocery store heist or the homeless man breaking out into song provide both humor and a commentary on how unsubstantial and irrelevant musicals are. But aren&apos;t they fun?\n\nThe most obvious example of the theme is the Julia Roberts storyline. She gets everything she ever wanted, but instead of making her happy in her new life, it helps her therapy for her old life. Joe was married to Steffi, all the woman he ever wanted, but he was so afraid it would fall apart that it did fall apart. Skylar wants a man to take control and sweep her off her feet, but when Charles Ferry comes along and does just that, she can&apos;t live with the consequences. There are other examples.\n\nThe execution of the movie is awkward and sometimes off-putting. But this movie is an experiment in form x function - what kind of story lends itself to the musical form? Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&apos;t. For example, it used to be that musicals helped you into the mood by introducing songs, something that couldn&apos;t be done here because of the very nature of the story. It can be stagey and forced if you&apos;re not already in the mood. On the whole, however, everyone seems to be having a good time, and it shows up in mostly loose, endearing performances - even the ever-annoying Goldie Hawn, who I&apos;d normally want to toss in the river in any other movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite being the birthplace of the brilliant pioneer of fantasy films, Segundo De Chom√≥n (whose films rivaled Georges M√©li√®s in quality and inventive), Spain&apos;s filmography within the realm of the horror genre is considerably poor before the 60s, when Jesus (or Jess) Franco inaugurated Spaniard horror. This was the result of the difficult political climate of the country during the regime of dictator Francisco Franco. In fact, while there were a couple of fantasy films done before 1962, the only true horror film was a little known movie titled &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot;, directed by Edgar Neville, and based on a popular pulp novel written by Emilio Carrere. However, despite being the only example of Spaniard horror film-making in the 40s, this film is more than a mere curiosity, it is actually a forgotten gem of the genre.\n\nSet in 19th century Madrid, a young man named Basilio (Antonio Casal) decides to play roulette, hoping to make some money to go on a date with the girl he likes. Suddenly, a mysterious character appears (F√©lix De Pom√©s) out of nowhere, and tells Basilio exactly where the ball is going to fall. Winning a small fortune thanks to the stranger, Basilio decides to thank him for the help, only to discover that the mysterious man, named Don Robinson De Mantua, is the ghost of an archaeologist who supposedly committed suicided years ago. In return for the help at the roulette, Don Robinson asks Basilio to protect his daughter In√©s (Isabel De Pom√©s) and help her solve his crime, as Don Robinson was actually murdered. And so Basilio gets involved in a mystery that will take him to discover the entrance to the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks.\n\nAs written above, &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot; is based on Emilio Carrere&apos;s novel of the same name (which was partially written by Jes√∫s De Arag√≥n), however, there are many differences between the novel and the film, specially in the tone that scriptwriters Edgar Neville and Jos√© Santugini give to the story. While the novel has a somber dark humor, Neville&apos;s film ops for a lighthearted style, more in tone with American horror and adventure movies (that definitely were a big influence on Neville) than with its literary source. This is not really a bad thing, as the movie keeps the thrilling mix of mystery, humor and suspense of the novel, and I&apos;d go as far as to say that Neville&apos;s decision of making a fun movie over a meaningful one actually benefits the film, as while certainly an imitation of Hollywood&apos;s typical style, it&apos;s anything but conventional.\n\nWhere the movie excels is in its execution, as Neville gives good use to the excellent work of cinematography done by Henri Barreyre and Andr√©s P√©rez Cubero, giving the film a haunting beauty. The most striking feature of the film is definitely its wonderful set design, with the recreation of the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks having a beautiful expressionist look that feels like taken out from a 1920s German film. The contrast between the surreal expressionism of the Tower with the Gothic atmosphere of Madrid&apos;s streets (in scenes shot on location) give the movie an effective nightmarish look, which definitely bring back memories from the American horror films from the 30s (specially the ones by Universal Studios). However, what makes this mix of influences work is Neville&apos;s own brand of humor, which gives the film a distinctive personality of its own.\n\nThe cast is for the most part effective, with Antonio Casal leading the cast and making a good job at handling the comedic side of his character (his Braulio is goodhearted, but cowardly and specially naive). As his romantic interest, In√©s, actress Isabel De Pom√©s is good, although nothing really special. Still, this could be blamed to the fact that her character isn&apos;t very well developed and it&apos;s a stereotypical damsel in distress. On the other hand, Guillermo Mar√≠n is extraordinary as the mysterious Doctor Sabatino, delivering a powerful performance that definitely ranks among the best in Spain&apos;s horror filmography. Mar√≠n captures perfectly the mix of charming amiability and perverse wickedness that makes Sabatino such an interesting character and he is easily the best in the cast. Finally, F√©lix De Pom√©s is quite funny as Don Robinson&apos;s ghost, despite his limited screen time.\n\nNow, while &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot; is certainly an excellent and entertaining film, it sadly is far from being perfect, mainly because in his attempt for imitating the commercially successful American films, director Neville also brings those films&apos; flaws, specifically, their reliance on clich√©s. While the movie has a wonderfully expressionist look and the story is certainly inventive, the plot unfolds in a very conventional way, and while entertaining, it isn&apos;t exactly the masterpiece that could had been or that its very artistic look may indicate. This dependence on common clich√©s and some cheap jokes do make a bit simplistic and predictable what otherwise could had been a quite haunting tale of horror. Fortunately, the damage is not really big, and &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot; can still be enjoyed without problem.\n\nOf course, this last criticism is probably just nitpicking, as in the end, &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot; fulfills its purpose without great difficulty: it provides good entertaining as Basilio uncovers the thrilling horrors of the Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks. While it would take several years after this film&apos;s release for horror to resurrect completely, &quot;La Torre De Los Siete Jorobados&quot; did open the doors for the fantastic in Spain&apos;s filmography. For this and several other reasons (like its expressionist look, which must be seen to be believed), this little known gem is more than a mere curiosity, it is truly Spain&apos;s first horror classic.\n\n8/10",

No longer did they have the presence of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and that really showed.\n\nIt tells the story of a rich American who plans on making the opening of a mummy&apos;s sarcophagus a tourist event in order to make money but oddly enough things don&apos;t go quite as planned.\n\nThe film looks great, the performances though spotty are mostly passable and the Hammer Horror brand of musical score is present. It&apos;s all very colour by numbers stuff, but that&apos;s okay.\n\nSadly the writing is inconsistent, some is poor and some is baffling especially when it comes to character development.\n\nPassable stuff but again this underlines why though I appreciate Hammer Horror I&apos;ve never exactly been blown away by it.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLooks great\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe absence of the likes of Cushing/Lee is very damaging\n\nThe bulletproof bandages have returned!\n\nMummy actually looks worse\n\nNo character consistency\n\nAwful cover art\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nBelly dancing is sexy or awkward, never anything inbetween",

Unexplained malfunctions and tragedies keep happening in seemingly supernatural ways.\n\nHas a dead crewmember returned, or is the lowering oxygen level causing everyone to go insane?\n\nAs the story unfolds, we find that not everyone is what they appear to be. As in all of the best of these underwater thrillers, the action takes place in corridors and quarters so tight that movement is severely restricted. This adds to the tense feeling of suffocation, and makes us feel trapped along with the crew.\n\nThe Director and cast are flawless in creating a thick atmosphere of terror and madness. Bruce Greenwood and Olivia Williams are especially good in their roles.\n\nHighly recommended..."

      "reviewBody": "Although directed by Bob Balaban of all people (most will know him as one of Christopher Guest&apos;s regulars in his series of comic pseudo-documentaries like &quot;Best in Show&quot;), &quot;Parents&quot; is clearly heavily influenced by David Lynch (Lynch&apos;s regular composer Angelo Badalementi is put to good use here by Mr. Balaban). One wonders if this is what life was like for David Lynch growing up as an Eagle Scout in the picture perfect 1950&apos;s. This is one of the most disturbing darkly comic horror movies I have ever seen. My jaw hung open for the film&apos;s entire length, my heart was racing at the climax in the cellar, and by the time the &quot;sitcom-style&quot; end credits rolled I was laughing out loud. \n\nThe film is told from the point of view of a 10 year old boy growing up in a cold, sanitized, and Uncanny 1950&apos;s suburbia with his parents who are so perfect they are down-right creepy (played wonderfully by Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt). The kid knows something must be up, and the film eerily displays the dark fantasies that can develop in a child&apos;s mind when he isn&apos;t quite sure why the world is the way it is and that everything seems slightly off-kilter. We&apos;ve all had these feelings when lonely and isolated and it is especially apparent in those odd pre-teen years when we are old enough to know the difference between fantasy and reality yet not mature enough to handle just what that reality now is. What essentially happens in this film is the young boy walks in on his parents having sex one night after waking up from a nightmare and then develops a bizarre fantasy where they have become cannibals. Freud would have a field day with this film. Balaban puts the psycho back in psychosexual with the kind of wanton abandon only Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Lynch have previously dared. The latter half of the film follows the conventions of your standard horror flick and does it so beautifully you will be left shivering. Sublime, satirical, uncanny, and as near perfect a cult film as you could ask for. \n\nAlso recommended: &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;The Shining,&quot; &quot;Blue Velvet,&quot; &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; &quot;Frailty,&quot; and &quot;Donnie Darko.&quot;",

This one reminds me of a low budget Die Hard 4.0 remake(in fact Die Hard 4.0 was made many years after this one) The story is very simple and easy to follow, Tommy Lee gets a disc and evil Russian Mobsters want it back, so Tommy Lee is gonna kick some Russian Butt, it did however not feel like a best of the best movie(the previous movies did not seem to matter, i mean Tommy Lee has a cop brother in law , why didn&apos;t he asked him to take the disc, and what about the girl from the third movie?) All in all, a action movie with some good martial arts. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Dwayne Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck) carries a basket around with him. He tells his landlord (Robert Vogel) that it contains &quot;clothes&quot;, but that&apos;s not quite true. The secret of the basket is fiendish, nasty and is liable to tear your face off if you stand in its way. (And there&apos;s a plot that&apos;s sort of like &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; in the way Dwayne tracks down the doctors...)\n\nThis film is very obviously low-budget, costing only $33,000, but the director (Frank Henenlotter) does not let that distract him. In fact, he almost turns it into a joke, using his friend&apos;s apartment as a makeshift &quot;hotel&quot;. He has Dwayne carrying a large sum of cash, but is actually rather small when you know that it represents the actual budget of the film. And to make the film appear more professional than it was, they even faked the credits. As one trivia site explains, &quot;The crew was very small and rather then repeat the same names over and over again they decided to just make up names.&quot; \n\nThere&apos;s something of a time capsule effect in this film. Much is filmed on 42nd Street in New York, during its porn and hooker glory years. You won&apos;t see that anymore, but you can forever see it in this film. And one scene is filmed in the basement of the legendary sado-masochistic Hellfire Club, complete with real-life glory holes. (To see what the club looks like now, you can see it on the DVD features.)\n\nI think this movie must set the record for most times the phrase &quot;what&apos;s in the basket?&quot; is used in a single film. I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s not the film&apos;s tag line, because I think I counted six instances. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s supposed to be a running joke or if the writer is just that uninventive. (For fun, if you&apos;re a smoker, have a cigarette each time someone asks. That will be almost as much fun as the &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; smoking game!) Some scenes are fairly cheesy. The puppetry is amateur and the claymation is like something from &quot;Pee-Wee&apos;s Playhouse&quot; (yes, not even good enough to be compared to &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;). I enjoyed this and totally let it slide (cheesy effects from the 1980s are still better than modern computer effects in many cases).\n\nFor some reason, I really enjoy male nudity in movies (ask about my love of the films of Gregg Araki). I&apos;m not gay or anything... I&apos;m all about the ladies. But something about male nudity still comes off as a special thing in movies, maybe because I&apos;ve seen just about all you can see in life and this still remains a rarity. Well, anyway, this film has some unusual male nudity that leads to the film&apos;s climax (pun intended) and I think you&apos;ll want to be there when it happens.\n\nOh, and mullets. If you&apos;re hankering for a Jeff Goldblum mullet (the hair from &quot;The Fly&quot;, not &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;) you really need to see this one. It&apos;s actually more like the hair of noted linguist and psychologist Steven Pinker.\n\nMike Mayo calls the film, &quot;One of the all-time great low-budget horrors&quot; that &quot;is an ingeniously twisted original in every respect.&quot; It is one of the few horror films that Mayo has praised with four out of four bones on the Videohound rating scale. And with good reason. When it comes to low budget, few if any films get this big with so little -- &quot;Basket Case&quot; is a modern classic, and decades later can still be found on the shelves of many video stores. And what other film has mutant Siamese twin necrophilia?\n\nI went almost 25 years without seeing &quot;Basket Case&quot;. Don&apos;t make that same mistake. While this is not the greatest horror movie and not my favorite Henenlotter film, it has found its way into cult horror history (admit it, even if you never saw it you&apos;ve still heard of it). This happens for a reason, and after watching maybe you&apos;ll understand what that reason is. At the very least, you&apos;ll find out what&apos;s in the basket.",

For those who dig at the roots of human conflict or who want some short primers in a back-corner part of the world, your time won&apos;t be wasted - It is a hard story to follow, and seems improbable even as we watch, but Flores was an actual man, who stared in an earlier Fekete movie, &quot;Bolshe Vita&quot;, 1996. As she got to know him she was intrigued by his &apos;rootless&apos; background and decided to make a movie, with Chico himself. With some fictional elements, this is his story.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to follow in part because she seems to have stitched together film footage of varying quality. Some of it is rough and blurry. It&apos;s also hard because we ordinary film-buffs will not know the national flags being flown: we are not sure who Chico is fighting with, either in Hungary or later in shattering Yugoslavia. (Hint: he&apos;s with the Croatians against the Serbs and Chetniks.) - See more at: http://www.allinoneboat.org/#sthash.D27nZrzL.dpuf",

      "reviewBody": "The original &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; is one of my favorite comedies, a gleefully macabre and witty classic with some outstanding performances, especially Alec Guinness&apos; hysterical performance. It was also distinctively British. Now, I am not nearly as annoyed by remakes as many other filmgoers are- I merely find most of them unnecessary and hence avoid most of them. The only ones I respect are those that attempt to do something different. The Coens are probably my favorite living directors and among the more distinctive currently working, and they certainly put their own spin on an established comedy classic with this film.\n\nI think that the poor reception this film got is largely due to its sense of humor. The Coens&apos; dry wit present in several of their films is present here, mostly through the main character Professor Dorr, portrayed excellently by Tom Hanks in one of his better performances, but there&apos;s also a lot of low-brow humor, and not even distinctive or interesting low-brow humor, just &apos;haha he dropped an f-bomb&apos; sort, which is really at odds with the rest of this film. Really, take out Marlon Wayans and his annoying character and you would have one of the best remakes ever made. Instead you&apos;ve got this film.\n\n&quot;The Ladykillers&quot;, in spite of its awful reputation, is really not a bad film at all. It&apos;s got atmosphere, it&apos;s beautifully photographed, it&apos;s fairly amusing, and the majority of the performances are very good. It&apos;s inferior by the Coens&apos; standards but still better than most comedies released in 2004. In addition, although it takes a lot of liberties with the original story, it recreates the most memorable sequences from the original with care and obvious affection, resulting in a hugely entertaining last twenty minutes in which so many memorable images from Mackendrick&apos;s classic Ealing comedy are translated to the American south. \n\nThis is a minor film for the Coens, but obviously one made with love and affection. It&apos;s fairly flawed, but it&apos;s also quite amusing and features and outstanding performance from Tom Hanks, an actor I don&apos;t normally think is particularly great. \n\n7/10"

      "reviewBody": "Every so often there&apos;s a movie that&apos;s so hard to describe that it&apos;s to picture whether it&apos;s your type of movie or not. The Jacket melds about five different genres without falling firmly into any of them. Even to describe it as an &apos;alternative reality&apos; movie could put off those who think, &quot;Oh, no, not another sci-fi&quot;. I wouldn&apos;t describe it as sci-fi. There is a love story, but I wouldn&apos;t call it that. There&apos;s some pretty disturbing shots and dizzying camera work but it&apos;s not really a horror film. What can you rely on? A stellar cast for starters: Adrien Brody, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson. All needed as the story is not exactly flawless, but the combined characterisations and sheer ingenuity keep you in suspense and mostly make you want to forgive any shortcomings in this rather ambitious project.\n\nIf you like stories nice and simple, stay away. If you like a challenge, The Jacket might fill the bill. It&apos;s not quite such a headbanging puzzle as Mulholland Drive, and it doesn&apos;t have the cutesiness of Donnie Darko, but it is in the realm of dark, weird and ultimately rather moving experimental film.\n\nBrody is Mr quite nice guy Jack Starks, apparently shot dead at point blank range in the Gulf War - but hang on a minute, his eyelids blink before they pronounce him dead and he recovers - with amnesia but otherwise OK - then he gets committed to an asylum for the criminally insane fro a murder he didn&apos;t do, and we&apos;re talking 1990s when some pretty strange experimental psychotherapy went on behind closed doors. Enter the old doctor, played by Kris Kristofferson, who looks like he&apos;s had one too many acid trips and survived and believes he can think up new treatments for nutters like Jack Starks. During some pretty unconventional (not say unethical by today&apos;s standards) solitary &apos;treatment&apos;, Starks sees himself in 2007. The treatment is a combination of drugs and sensory deprivation - a sort of Neanderthal NLP the hard way. Each time he is locked up in &apos;The Jacket&apos;, Starks&apos; projected timeline lets him interact with other characters in his dilemma. It gets continuingly creepier and the tension builds to an ending that leaves you shocked, horrified and filled with warmth at the same time.",

      "reviewBody": "It was not too much of a strain for Alan Alda to do Sweet Liberty as his character of Hawkeye Pierce from MASH stepped right from the small screen to the big. Imagine Hawkeye as an American history professor writing a book on the southern theater of the American Revolution and you&apos;ve got a start to Sweet Liberty.\n\nAlda has not only written a book, but it was so good that he got some big bucks from Hollywood for the screen rights. And the company is going to film on location in North Carolina where Alda teaches history at a college and where he participates in the annual recreation of the Battle of Cowpens. But one read of what the Hollywood writers have done to his work and he&apos;s ready to sue.\n\nWell that&apos;s not going to work because they&apos;ve got the contract and the lawyers to back them up. How to salvage his work, for that he turns to screenwriter Bob Hoskins to help him navigate the ways of the movie business jungle. Hoskins too would like to see his name on something worthwhile and maybe Academy Award winning.\n\nThis involves Alda wooing in a different way stars of the film Michael Caine and Michelle Pheiffer. Caine is quite a wooer himself and the best performance from the supporting cast is that of Lois Chiles who plays Caine&apos;s wife who&apos;s decided he&apos;s been on too long a leash.\n\nBut in the scenes he&apos;s in Bob Hoskins truly steals Sweet Liberty. He&apos;s the quintessential Hollywood man who drags Alan Alda along through the highways and byways of movie speak. Saul Rubinek is also good as a most harassed and egotistical director.\n\nI would like to have seen more of Lillian Gish playing Alda&apos;s dotty mother who wants to hook up with a bricklayer she had a LONG ago fling with. It&apos;s that way with Alzheimer&apos;s patients they remember something from ages ago, but not what they had for dinner yesterday. All I can say was the sex must have been fabulous.\n\nSweet Liberty is nice sparkling comedy about the business of making movies.",

The story here is a bit Bolwderized (some sex, and much cruelty have been removed from the traditional version). But it is still complex and has lots of side stories, like how she disguises herself as one of her maids in waiting. And how the stepmother tried a comb first, before the apple.\n\nThe structure of the play on which this is based is supposedly influenced by the revival of Macbeth then current in London, where the Shakespeare story is explained as controlled by the three witches. Here it is almost as if the witch were responsible for the Faustian deal the ugly stepmother makes.\n\nThis film was conceived as a direct result of the amazing popularity of &quot;Birth of a Nation,&quot; perhaps the most influential film in history. That&apos;s because Birth cemented the notion that movies are like plays ¬ó not an entirely predetermined outcome. This was the first big budget play to be movie-ized afterward.\n\nThe film is in bad condition, so you have to imagine which cuts were original and which are because of missing segments. I prefer to imagine most of the jumps as missing material because the thing moves so languorously in what we see. For instance, there&apos;s a clearly drawn Queen&apos;s Toady who we spend many minutes watching in pompous walk.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "reviewBody": "A documentary about a man (Nev) who starts a relationship with a woman he meets on face-book, and starts to wonder how truthful this person is. If you watch the trailer for this movie it is very misleading, not to say its a bad movie but it&apos;s not at all what I expected. This is a true life account that I&apos;m sure has happened to many people. An 8 year old girl named Abby starts to send Nev paintings she has done after seeing a picture Nev took in a newspaper. Out of that Nev begins to talk with Angela (Abby&apos;s mom) and it carries over to Megan (Abby&apos;s sister). After quickly falling in love with Megan, Nev soon discovers Megan may not be who she says she is and plans a trip to visit her and find out the truth. Every once in a while a movie comes along that you just have to keep watching and your not sure why, and when it&apos;s over your not sure why it had this grip on you, this is one of those movies. This is not for everyone, being that it is a documentary and slow in parts, but it is very interesting and has an ending that sneaks up on you and affects you in a way you can&apos;t explain. At least it did to me. I give it a B-",

      "reviewBody": "First, I should say that the movie definitely had some funny, enjoyable scenes. However, the movie was laden with way too many derogatory gay jokes. I was uncomfortable hearing so many bigoted, insulting, ignorant jokes. Many in the audience I was in laughed, but I squirmed at every &quot;joke.&quot; Even in the movie&apos;s context of perhaps mocking homophobes, it was not necessary to have some many. Could you imagine a movie about African-Americans full of white characters spouting out a constant barrage of jokes about fried chicken and bananas and athletic prowess? And was it necessary for the main character to be such an effeminate stereotype? As for the plot, the director&apos;s soap opera experience was obvious; the plot had several wrenching shifts from light humor to attempts at deep seriousness. If you want to see good Spanish humor without the stereotyping and gay-bashing &quot;jokes,&quot; I&apos;d suggest Almodovar&apos;s many excellent comedies.",

      "reviewBody": "Before I took a chance on this film there was really only one question I wanted answered...\n\n&apos;Is this film going to be another steaming pile of disappointment like the AVP films?&apos;\n\nAnd the answer, happily, is &apos;No&apos;, though after having to sift through all the unhelpful and uninformative 1 rater reviews here, I never would have guessed. I almost gave this film a miss, but I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t. It was actually quite good, and I&apos;ll tell you why (no spoilers I promise). \n\nI think it is important to go into this film with the right expectations. This film returns to the original Predator format, and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. There are scenes and characters (and even weapons) which are so reminiscent of the first film that they would not be out of place in a remake. I like to view this as very deliberate homage to the original rather than shameless plagiarism, and I enjoyed the film more and feel much happier because of it. Of course this is not a remake. It is a sequel with some major differences from the 1987 film, and enough originality to make it interesting and unique in its own right.\n\nThe story is not overly ambitious, they play it straight and the focus is given more to building tension, which it manages to do very well. Because it is a Predator film you kind of know what is going to happen, but it still manages to be suspenseful from the start, and there are quite a few surprises and twists along the way to keep you guessing. The unnerving way the truth of their situation unfolds for the characters is quite enthralling, and reminded me strongly of shows like &apos;The Outer Limits&apos;.\n\nThe characters are interesting and all of them are well portrayed. Some are a little clich√©, but the main character played by Adrien Brody is actually more human and teeters on the edge of being a full blown anti- hero. \n\nMy only major gripe with this film is that there is little character development. The characters are (as I said) interesting, but there just doesn&apos;t seem to be enough time to explore them very deeply. The most you really get is a shallow glimpse of who they might be, which left question marks over some of their motivations. This does make the film slightly forgettable, as you never really end up feeling or caring too much for them, and sometime it feels like they do things just to drive the plot/action forward, rather than because it is something their character might do.\n\nOverall I would give the film a 7 out of 10, it was above average for and action flick and screamed quality, despite a retentively low budget, and I definitely wouldn&apos;t mind going to see it again. An entertaining action thriller at worst, and a nice edition to the Predator franchise.",

      "reviewBody": "The overall plot and pacing of the movie was pretty good. I appreciated the fact that the movie put together an origin story of sorts. I liked the drama aspects to the movie, rather than making it an out and out action flick.\n\nThings I disliked. Some of the soundtrack was awful, especially during the fight sequences. The soundtrack was a distraction rather than an accompaniment to the movie. The special effects was also pretty bad. I&apos;m kind of wondering if that was intentionally done - like to give the impression that this movie was &quot;retro&quot; in nature... Think 1970s special effects, and that&apos;s probably the closest approximation I can give for how bad the effects were. Godzilla seemed to have googly eyes for the most part! I don&apos;t know whether it was meant to be a joke or if they honestly thought the effects were convincing... I also generally don&apos;t really like stories with overpowered characters (whether they are the good guys or the bad guys) - unless the power levels are really done in a meaningful way.\n\nStill, overall, the movie captured some interesting ideas and takes on how to make a Godzilla movie... Ideas which perhaps can inspire Hollywood to build on.",

I have also watched many documentaries and movies made about the subject from China as well as from the US. I found this film to be one of better film on this subject than most of the other ones in existence today.\n\nThe film is based primarily on the actual diary of John Rabe. Certain details were filled-in by the excellent and exhaustive work of Iris Chang&apos;s The Rape of Nanking. The importance of John Rabe&apos;s diary as opposed to the other accounts of what happened during the massacred is the fact that John Rabe was a German Nazi Party member that was working for Siemen in China. Germany was an allied of Japan at the time and there would have been no reason for John Rabe to have lied about atrocities committed by the Japanese if it did not actually happened. Also since John was mainly writing this as a personal diary for himself, there does not seem to be any reason for him to have exaggerated his description of the event. As a result, his diary is probably the credible historical account of the what actually happened in Nanking.\n\nI found some the Chinese version of the film on the subject seemed a little removed from the complex character interactions between most of these reluctant heroes of war. As a result, those movies does not seem quite as genuine and touching as this film.\n\nMost the events from this film seems very accurate or at least true to the overall sense of John Rabe&apos;s diary. Obviously some of the atrocities had to be consolidated to be able to fit those events into a slightly over two hour film. But one of the most puzzling inaccuracy of the film was the fictional character Val√©rie Dupres at the International Girls College. Why was it necessary for the film to use a fictional character&apos;s name instead of the actual courageous heroine Minnie Vaultrin from the Ginling Girls College. She had done so much during the massacred that it seems unfair to not use her real name in the film. This is my primary reason for not giving this film a perfect 10. If anyone can provide an explanation as to why Minnie Vaultrin name was not used in this film, I really would appreciate it.",

      "reviewBody": "Making the leap from photographer to music video director to film director, Anton Corbijn&apos;s feature length debut &apos;Control&apos; is quite simply stunning. Shot entirely in black and white it tell the story of Ian Curtis the lead singer with Manchester band Joy Division but its also much more than that it also tells of one mans journey into the heart of darkness (Apocalypse Now is mentioned in the film) a journey of fear, paranoia, illness and depression. Curtis has been played in films before but only as bit parts (24 hour party people etc) here he is portrayed breathtakingly by Sam Riley who played Mark E Smith in 24 hour party people and when he first appears on the screen I have to admit I wasn&apos;t convinced but as Ian the person grows so too does Riley into the role and at times he has him so down to a tee its hard to imagine its not the real Curtis up there. The rest of the band are pretty good as well but are only really second fiddle to Riley but you have to give them credit for learning all the songs and playing them live rather than mime. Samantha Morton is great as the put upon wife Deborah and Craig Parkinson is convincing enough as Tony Wilson but apart from Riley&apos;s stand out performance its Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton who has some of the best lines and has come so far since his role in &apos;Dead Man&apos;s Shoes&apos;. The cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes, being shot in black and white adds to the mood and gives a haunting feel that echo&apos;s the music and lyrics of the band, it also means (and I guess its Corbijn&apos;s photography background) that so many of the shots in the movie could be still images they are framed so well. Although never really explained in terms of answers, Curtis&apos;s illness from the seizures to the depression and the hopeless sense of falling apart reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Polanski&apos;s &apos;Repulsion&apos; another black and white film that deals with madness. I guess that treating mental illnesses was still in its infancy in the seventies, yes we&apos;d stopped electro-shocking people but medications were still being developed and trialled. It seems it was very easy for Curtis to reach a certain point what with juggling home, life on the road, his condition and the pressure of increasing fame but when it came to helping him out he really was on his own and did feel a sense of &apos;isolation&apos;. But with a story that has a widely known end point its more about the journey and here Corbjin punctures the narrative with some truly witty moments while leading up the incredibly moving and inevitable finale. Handled brilliantly by all involved this is another example of a great British film that deserves all the accolades it is receiving and if this performance is anything to go by expect Riley to be very big indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "Greer Garson was 51 when she made this movie, and still beautiful. I say &quot;still&quot; because in Hollywood in that era 40 was considered over-the-hill for a leading lady, so kudos to the studio for having her play the lead, and not someone&apos;s aunt or spinster older sister. Unfortunately, this movie doesn&apos;t have a lot going for it outside of Greer&apos;s considerable charm and acting ability. I&apos;m a fan of Dana Andrews, but as others have noted, his acting style does not compliment Greer&apos;s, and his character is such a mean-spirited misogynistic jerk that it&apos;s hard not to intensely dislike him. Of course we know we&apos;re being set up for the ultimate romantic happy ending, but that&apos;s another issue with this movie. Everything is predictable.\n\nMaybe the most interesting aspect of &quot;Strange Lady in Town&quot; is the chance to see a young Lois Smith in a major role. She went on to a very long, distinguished career as a character actress in movies and TV. (literally now in her 7th decade). Her &apos;Spurs&apos; in &quot;Strange Lady&quot; is a little bit out there, but that&apos;s been true of many of her roles over the years. I recently saw her as an emotionally disturbed psychic on an episode of &quot;Route 66&quot; from the early &apos;60s. She was a favorite of that show&apos;s producers, and made several appearances.",

      "reviewBody": "Akira Kurosawa is one of my very favorite filmmakers. If you search through my reviews, I have written about a few, The Seven Samurai, High and Low, Kagemusha, and Dreams. I have seen many more, Rashomon, Ikiru (my personal favorite), Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Dersu Uzala, and Ran. I have only disliked one, High and Low, but not one of his films failed to amaze me in some way or other. My initial opinion, after seeing Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ran and Kagemusha was that he was an amazing stylist whose films felt slightly impersonal to me. I strongly disagree with that opinion now (I expressed it in my review to Kagemusha, which I&apos;m surprised hasn&apos;t resulted in tons of hate mail).\n\nI have just finished watching Kurosawa&apos;s second to last film, Rhapsody in August. It is not highly regarded, usually dismissed as a very minor work in a master&apos;s portfolio. This I also discovered about my second favorite of his films, Dreams. Well, as far as my opinion, I think people were dead wrong about both of these films. \n\nRhapsody in August is not a stylistic masterpiece like The Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, or Ran. Instead, only second to Ikiru, it is Kurosawa&apos;s most humanistic film. I have only seen one film by him (although I&apos;ve read a lot about him), but I would compare it more to Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s work.\n\n This film has a plethora of themes, ranging from the effect of the H-Bomb on both the Japanese and the Americans, the generation gaps between the three generations present (the matriarch of the family feels separate from her middle-aged children, but she relates well to her grandchildren who are interested in their country&apos;s sorrowful history), and the effect of American culture on the Japanese of the present generation. It is quite a handful, but everything is handled so subtly that some viewers who don&apos;t pick up on it all may easily grow uninterested. In some ways, the film feels very didactic (in a good way). I can imagine this film being showed to younger children, since the four grandchildren, at least at the beginning, are learning about the history of the bomb and Nagazaki and their grandfather&apos;s death. \n\nThe only weak point of the film is probably the very end, which is difficult to understand. I have a feeling that there was some cross-cultural barrier preventing my understanding of it, so if anyone does get it, please contact me. Anyway, as I perceived it, the film ended kind of randomly. But still, what has come before is too good to get too upset by the lack of closure. It deserves a 10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very dated western but so much so it makes it interesting to watch in spots. However, it&apos;s too long - 131 minutes - and I watched it on a VHS tape in which the sound quality wasn&apos;t the best, which helped make it too tough to watch in one sitting. Yet, for its uniqueness and strange-looking characters and strange scenes, it made it worthwhile to stick it through to the end. However, the first half of the film is a lot better than the second half.\n\nThis was Irene Dunne&apos;s first starring role and, frankly, I didn&apos;t recognize her. She was anything but pretty and certainly looked different. Her role was that a steady person who keeps her marriage together but has a major flaws, including a real prejudice against the local Indians. In the end, sees the error of her ways. Richard Dix plays her husband. He overacts and looks cartoonish most of the time. This movie was in the beginning of &quot;talkies&quot; and Dix still looked like he belonged in silent movies. He marries Dunne and quickly leaves to go wandering. He comes home briefly and leaves again....and it&apos;s okay. Strange.\n\nThe story revolves around the two leads (Yancy and Sabra Cravat&quot;) and the their town which grows from nothing into a big city by the late 1920s. Seeing that city grow was interesting.\n\nIncluded in this movie was the strangest &quot;gospel meeting&quot; I&apos;ve ever seen. It begins well-intentioned, but becomes so spiritually weak and so secular that it makes a farce out of the whole proceedings. You have to see this to believe it. I just shook my head in amazement about how Hollywood has never had a clue when it came to topics like this.\n\nI got rid of the VHS long ago but, if given the opportunity, now that it is out on DVD, would give it another look. It&apos;s almost a curiosity piece.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was made at a time when technology was moving almost faster than the imagination. Only a few years after Lindbergh&apos;s non-stop flight across the Atlantic, in this Germany decides to solve the problem of long transatlantic flights not by building planes that can fly further, but by building a gigantic platform in the middle of the Atlantic where planes can land and refuel. Only there are forces at work trying to keep the Floating Platform (hence F.P. #1) from becoming a success. Sabotage and spies add a layer of intrigue to what essentially is a love triangle between the commander of F.A. #1 and a gregarious pilot who both love the same woman. For the time, this film is quite impressive for its North Sea location photography as well as its flying scenes. Peter Lorre has a couple of good scenes as the hero&apos;s photographer buddy. I&apos;d rate it higher, but many parts of the story either don&apos;t hold up or don&apos;t make sense. Still, glad I got to see it once.",

      "reviewBody": "Legendary underground comic artist Robert Crumb of &quot;Keep on Truckin&quot; fame is transported back home--courtesy of his equally eccentric friend and cult director, Terry Zwigoff--to pay a visit to his wacky and disturbed family. Crumb, reluctantly, encounters his two bothers and mother in varying degrees of emotional collapse. The mother is a piece of work. She is in total denial about her boys. Crumb&apos;s two sisters, however, remain absent from the family&apos;s tragic downward spiral--and they don&apos;t participate (wisely) in Zwigoff&apos;s pet project (The story goes that the director threatened suicide to gain Crumb&apos;s full cooperation. Who knows the truth?) Back at the ranch--Crumb does live in the country--the artist&apos;s father is dead. His older brother lives in a single room on San Francisco&apos;s Skid Row, where he bathes sometimes and sleeps on a bed of nails. He also has dark thoughts about Asian women. Once in a while, he acts on them. His other bother lives with their crazy mother, never works, and reads and collects mountains of old, yellowed and tattered paperbacks. He refuses to read anything new. Everyone is manic depressive. On drugs. And bananas. But somehow Crumb has struck a balance between his art and personal life. He survives nicely with his wife and their daughter in a comfortable ranch house. The dwelling serves dual purposes: protection for his massive and priceless blues record collection, and personal solitude from an encroaching outside world. His next step is a permanent move to France! In the end, Crumb, the movie, is a worthwhile odyssey for anyone who wishes to feel better about their own family. You might find this movie on the bottom shelf of the video store or at a psych ward near you."

Implausible action sequences are forgiven with the wink of an eye from the director and actors. Some of the fastest action you will see that doesn&apos;t rely on wire-fu or CGI. Rather, we get a lot of the same from Frank and that is exactly what should be expected. I think in the modern era of the high concept action movies, they have forgotten how to just show the audience a good time. This movie and it&apos;s predecessor take us back to a time when action wasn&apos;t bogged down by complicated stories, rather the star&apos;s charisma and action were all that one needed to enjoy their time in the theater.\n\nThese movies have no lofty aspirations other than to give you one hell of a ride for an hour and a half.

      "reviewBody": "This movie is based on the fascinating real story of Rolf Ansch√ºtz, an enterprising cook who managed to successfully run a Japanese restaurant in the backwaters of 1970ies East Germany. You have to consider that it required extensive networking to get hold even of a can of tinned pineapples behind the iron curtain. Other than suggested by the movie title, I&apos;m not sure that this restaurant even served Sushi, which at the time was an obscure delicacy in most necks of the wodd outside of Japan.\n\nWith an interesting premise and great actors, the movie falters because of its generic script and has trouble filling its running time. The East German bureaucrats are initially reluctant to support the courageous plan, but quickly change their minds due to the &quot;peaceful contest between nations&quot;, and because Ansch√ºtz-san&apos;s carp-and-rice concoctions sell like, erm, hot buns. It&apos;s an OK movie to watch, but Ansch√ºtz&apos;s culinary endeavours often feel like some sort of carnival, like a dystopic game of cowboys and Indians. This is more plain potatoes rather than sumptuous Sushi.",

      "name": "A Fish Called Kusturica...",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Arizona Dream&quot; is a real UFO but the kind of UFO we want to be taken to whatever universe it would lead us to. That&apos;s pure cinematic escapism, in fact, pure cinema.\n\n&quot;Arizona Dream&quot; is strange and that might be the only objective point for critics and praises to converge to. And I&apos;ve got to speak for myself, the film is so hypnotic and enchanting that I can&apos;t imagine how it can ever be criticized, so this is a positive review, yes, because Hollywood is so dry on experiences like &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; that such movies deserve admiration.\n\nWhat&apos;s the story about? It&apos;s a tale about fishes, or one fish actually, a fish and a young man named Axel (Johnny Depp) who has strange dreams involving Eskimos and again, fishes ... I could go on and on, but the point is that all the plots and subplots I will enumerate will sound disjointed while they&apos;re so connected to the whole reverie that there&apos;s a weird feeling of coherency. The film transports us from one state to another (any meaning of state) without finding us questioning the reason. It doesn&apos;t make sense yet it does in the sense that it absorbs all your senses, like a real dream would do actually.\n\nAnd it doesn&apos;t come as a surprise that it&apos;s Emir Kusturica, perhaps the European heir of Fellini, who could translate a dream-like vision into a quite-easy-to-follow movie. Any other director would have added some black and white photography, some hallucinatory moments, some non-sequitur elements to better highlight the pointlessness of a plot. Kusturica&apos;s directing is not only confident about our attention but attentive about our degree of involvement. It knows when it needs to focus on something tangible and meaningful, and it knows when to throw all the conventions out and float above them, when to act and when to improvise. Even dreams can be codified, even reality needs to loosen up.\n\nAgain, what&apos;s the film about? Well, this is a film about relationships, some dramatic as the song says, it&apos;s about encounters that suddenly gives a total meaning to someone&apos;s life or seals the fates of others. Axel&apos;s uncle (Jerry Lewis) feels guilty for the loss of his nephew&apos;s parents and want him to work for him in his Cadillac-selling business, Elaine (Faye Dunaway) is a woman who dreams of flying, Paul (Vincent Gallo) wants to be an actor, Elaine&apos;s daughter Grace (Lily Taylor) a turtle. Realistic or crazy, we&apos;re all defined by a quest, a secret will. And these quests always find a root in the past or some dream, whether the past defines the dream or the dream shapes the future might paint the essence of the present.\n\nI don&apos;t think it goes further than that, trying to find other meanings would mean entrapping this film in a rational box while there is more to enjoy besides depth. Like a Kusturica movie, this film has a lot of music going on, a lot of accordion, a lot of dancing and loving, of passion and pathos, even jealousy and envy are powerfully conveyed by the performance of the two peripheral characters played by Taylor and Gallo, while Depp and Dunaway can abandon themselves in an ocean of lust and fully enjoy their romance until they learn to deal with the consequences. How weird that you could feel the word &quot;deep&quot; in Depp and Faye Dunaway almost rhymes with &quot;fly&quot; and &quot;runaway&quot;.\n\nAnd as a leitmotif, we have this flying fish caught earlier by an Eskimo who belongs to either a dream or a reality, to say that it makes the connection between the opening scene and the rest of the film or the rest of the film with the ending scene is beside the point, if there&apos;s any, yet, there&apos;s a feeling of completeness, the idea that sometimes, we all have a vision of what we should do and what shall become of us. If the Eskimo metaphor is right, so maybe whatever the protagonists wish to happen to them after they die, will indeed happen... because maybe that&apos;s what Heaven is about.\n\nWhy would Uncle Leo be so sure he&apos;d meet Axel&apos;s parent if he died? It doesn&apos;t really matter because at that moment, we&apos;ve embraced the film&apos;s magic and we believe he does. Later, Axel says to Grace that he used to love her mother but then she became a cloud he could see through and realized he loved her. Axel is crazy in the way he sticks to his vision but so does everyone. In another scene meant for laughs, Paul impersonates Cary Grant in the famous plane scene of &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, from our perspective, with the images of the original film, it&apos;s a masterstroke of impersonation, for the audience, his motionlessness is ridiculous. Does it matter again? No. Paul believes in his talent. And Kusturica opens our eyes about it.\n\nAnd that might be the &apos;point&apos; after all. The most remembered part from the film is the flying sequence and the unforgettable &quot;Death Car&quot; song from Iggy Pop and Goran Bergovic, the score contains many more haunting musical gems saying in musical language that heaven isn&apos;t in our visions, but in their fulfillments. That might be what film-making is about, it starts with a vision and the rest is just poetry in motion. Kusturica is aware than he&apos;s privileged for making such movies, which would be impossible today.\n\nBut he had this luck to come at Hollywood at the right time, the right moment, to have Johnny Depp before he became a supreme movie star, Faye Dunaway who was always &quot;in&quot; for ambitious projects (&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; was a blessing in disguise as it allowed her to work in weird but fascinating movies like this or &quot;Barfly&quot;) and Lewis, Gallo, Taylor complete the gallery of eccentric but appealing protagonists, I mentioned Fellini but there&apos;s something weirdly Hustonian in that bunch of dreaming misfits.\n\nAnd something unique about Kusturica, as usual...",

      "reviewBody": "This CinemaScope musical romance from 20th Century Fox and director Jean Negulesco stars Fred Astaire as millionaire Jervis Pendleton III. On a business trip to France, he happens upon an orphanage where he hears 18-year-old Julie Andre (Leslie Caron) singing to the other kids. Impressed by her talent, he arranges to anonymously adopt her and have her sent to America to an exclusive girls&apos; boarding school. Julie has never met Jervis, and she imagines all sorts of romantic notions about his appearance and demeanor. When Jervis later meets Julie, he falls in love with her, but doesn&apos;t reveal that he&apos;s her adoptive father, which can only spell trouble down the line. Also featuring Ray Anthony &amp; His Orchestra.\n\nThis was another early attempt to utilize the CinemaScope widescreen format in the musical genre, and it had mixed results. Some of the numbers are visually impressive, like Caron&apos;s ballet number later in the film, but others seem to keep the action to the center of the screen, wasting the wider imagery. The story isn&apos;t as creepy as it sounds, although there&apos;s no way this would get green-lit today. Caron was quite likeable here. Reportedly this movie was a favorite of director Akira Kurosawa. It earned Oscar nominations for Best Color Art Direction, Best Score (Alfred Newman), and Best Song (&quot;Something&apos;s Gotta Give&quot;).",

      "reviewBody": "Skip through the special features on the DVD of Peter Yates Bullitt (1968) and you&apos;ll find an interesting featurette entitled Steve McQueen&apos;s Commitment to Reality; a promo made at the time of the film&apos;s production. As this quaint little curio unravels, we&apos;re told that McQueen had driven the iconic Ford Mustang for real, during the seminal car chases. The viewer is given the impression that the film&apos;s star is really something special for doing so. FACT: Next to French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo&apos;s stunt work in Peur Sur La Ville, McQueen was merely dipping his little toe in a very deep pool! Reality indeed!\n\nThe action sequences in Peur Sur La Ville are nothing short of jaw dropping, even by the standards of movies today. One chase sequence in particular has Belmondo pursuing a suspect up an interior stairwell, out through a window, across a series of rooftops whilst hanging onto various fascias and bits of guttering. Smashing through a skylight, he falls into a department store. Once again on street level, a car-chase ensues, climaxing with Belmondo running atop a moving train! Verneuil lets his audience know that it&apos;s his leading man putting his neck on the line. Belmondo is clearly seen, every step of the way. This is undoubtedly one of the best examples of its kind ever committed to celluloid.\n\nPeur Sur La Ville would probably never have been conceived if it hadn&apos;t been for the aforementioned Bullitt or for that matter, William Friedkin&apos;s The French Connection (1971).For years, European critics sneered at American remakes/reworkings of classic foreign language films and held theirs heads high with the view that continental cinema was not only innovative, but actually set the trends for the Yanks to replicate.  However, Bullitt, French Connection and Don Siegel&apos;s Dirty Harry (1971) set the record straight once and for all; the anti-hero cop was as American as the hamburger. These groundbreaking films introduced audiences to unorthodox cops that had a case to break, by any means necessary. Sometimes these cops would act as ruthless as the criminals they were fighting to keep off the streets. All three films upped the ante in terms of action and break-neck editing.\n\nBy the mid seventies, Italian directors such as Enzo G. Castellari (High Crime), Franco Martinelli (Violent Rome/Roma Violenta) Fernando De Leo (Calibre 9/Milano Calibre) and Umberto Lenzi (The Tough Ones/Italia a Mano Armata) were all dabbling with this new found genre. Whereas their American counterparts had cast the likes of Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson and Gene Hackman, the Italians were making stars out of Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, Maurizio Merli and Fabio Testi. Although immensely enjoyable almost all of these Italian poliziers never rose above formulaic. However, Verneuil, a Turkish film-maker working in France managed to pull off a real coup with Peur Sur La Ville. By making his film a hybrid of both polizier and giallo, it works on both levels and gives it the substance lacking from the Italian pictures.\n\nA diabolical killer calling himself Minos, is on the loose in Paris. Having lived through the `free love&apos; of the sixties and not getting any, he decides that he will `act as an arm of justice that will condemn without pity and execute all those who wallow in the sexual mud that is drowning us.&apos; After establishing his motive, he sets about murdering promiscuous females. Hot on his heels is police Inspector Latelier (Belmondo). Minos taunts Latelier by sending a piece of his picture after each murder, in the view that the photograph will be complete when his work is done.\n\nAs Paris&apos; most unorthodox detective, Latelier gets sadistic pleasure from seeing his suspects squirming. During one of the Sub-plots, Latelier refuses to call a critically wounded drug dealer an ambulance until he gets the information he is after, which echoes Eastwood&apos;s Callaghan in Dirty Harry.\n\nAs much as Verneuil was influenced by the like of Siegel and Freidkin, Peur sur La Ville owes a huge debt to the films of Mario Bava. The opening scene in which Minos taunts a victim on the phone, is reminiscent of The Telephone episode of Bava&apos;s anthology Black Sabbath (1963).Later during the aforementioned chase sequence, after crashing through the skylight, Latelier and Minos face off amongst the mannequins of a poorly lit store room; a nod to the Italian maestro&apos;s Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1969).\n\nPeur Sur La Ville features a wonderful music score by none other than Ennio Morricone. The score is integral to some of the set pieces as one would expect. During the tense opening, Morricone orchestrates only a single drumbeat. This is extremely unnerving, as we the audience, know that Minos is about to knock at the door!\n\nCanal + Video&apos;s DVD is presented anamorphically, in its original widescreen ratio of 1:66:1. This is as good a transfer as one could expect from a film of this age. Print damage is minimal but the colours seem a little washed-out. The sound is presented in two-channel mono, but is well balanced and serves Morricone&apos;s score well. The viewer has the choice of watching the film either in the original French language or in a dubbed English version. There are no subtitles available. Extra features are limited to the original theatrical trailer (in French), an interview with Verneuil (again in French) and a poster gallery.\n\nPeur Sur La Ville is one of the lost landmarks of action cinema but is also so much more. If you have a thing for poliziers or giallos, this ones for you!"

      "reviewBody": "I re-watched &apos;Flesh For Frankenstein&apos; last week for the first time in years, and I enjoyed it even more this time than I did the last. This movie just gets better and better as the years go by. A sensational mixture of gore, humour, horror, sex and subversion. They really DON&apos;T make them like this anymore! Udo Kier had several movies under his belt before this including the hugely underrated &apos;Mark Of The Devil&apos;, but his unforgettable role here, and in Paul Morrissey&apos;s companion piece &apos;Blood For Dracula&apos;, sealed his fate forever as one of the living legends of trash and exploitation movies. This is absolutely essential viewing for cult/horror/black comedy fans. A true classic!"

This movie is plainly and simply an excellent movie about a drag racing team and the wrongs dealt them from their sponsor&apos;s track rep, and the interesting way they get even with him. The script and dialogue are the most accurate portrayal of the sport that I have seen yet...the producer/writers obviously knew their stuff and have actually *been* to a dragstrip, not merely &quot;speculated&quot; about one.\n\nHighly recommend this movie as one of the &quot;must see&quot;&apos;s  for those who are a fan of the sport, or who are even curious to get a taste for it.  (This coming from a gal who &quot;grew up on the track&quot;.)"

She and her pal Ken (Jackie Cooper) put on musical plays in the guest house of her parents&apos; estate. Alice&apos;s newspaper mogul father invites journalist Vincent Bullitt (Melvyn Douglas) to stay and work in said guest house‚Äîand Alice is quickly distracted from her friends by the romantic and dashing Mr. Bullitt.\n\nJackie Cooper gives a superior performance as the best friend who loves Alice and has to watch her chase after the older, successful and glamorous man of the world. Melvyn Douglas is good as Vincent Bullitt but his character is slightly bland, at least for someone who&apos;s supposed to be such an adventurer.\n\nThe plot is okay if not especially surprising; it&apos;s a sympathetic look at young love that tries to represent the viewpoints of both the kids involved and the parents and other grownups around them. It doesn&apos;t entirely work‚Äîthis is one of those pictures where all the adults are so darn wise and well-meaning it&apos;s just kind of irritating. The kids‚ÄîDurbin, Cooper, even little Juanita Quigley as the pesty little sister‚Äîcome across as much more genuine.\n\nDeanna sings a few songs‚Äîa couple of operatic numbers that are fine as well as a handful of new songs that are pleasant but no classics. Durbin&apos;s acting performance, however, is superb‚Äîshe is totally convincing, as is Jackie Cooper, himself an old pro at age 16. Durbin and Cooper certainly leave the grown up actors in the dust.\n\nDefinitely worthwhile for fans of these young stars.\n\nResearch question: Did everybody really know Morse code in the 1930s, or was it just kids in the movies?",

      "name": "Boogie Nights OR &quot;How I learned to ignore the consequences, and love the freedom of the 1970&apos;s.&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at.  Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.\n\nWhere to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970&apos;s porn industry-and what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber.  But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven&apos;t experienced since the film greats of the 1970&apos;s...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John&apos;s performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I&apos;m a sucker for the line &quot;Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.&quot;  Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director/Writer/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I&apos;ver ever seen...that being the New Year&apos;s party sequence.\n\nThe music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970&apos;s. OK, back to the performances.\n\nBurt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of &quot;film&quot; means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton&apos;s Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!\n\nJulianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.\n\nThe film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970&apos;s. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.",

      "reviewBody": "Entertaining docudrama about the history of the FBI, as told by one agent in particular named Chip (James Stewart). Yes, it&apos;s more fiction than fact but it&apos;s also a good movie. Judging by some of the reviews here, most of the people hating on the movie seem to be political ax grinders. Obviously J. Edgar Hoover had a hands-on part in the making of this film. He inspires Jimmy to stick with the FBI in an amusingly corny scene. But I&apos;m judging the movie on an entertainment basis, first and foremost, and this movie is entertaining. \n\nThe FBI parts are great. The parts dealing with Jimmy&apos;s domestic life not so much. Vera Miles is very attractive as a blonde and plays the clich√©d but likable wife role well. It&apos;s just this part of the movie isn&apos;t that interesting and takes up too much time in a movie that goes on for over two hours. Murray Hamilton is good as Jimmy&apos;s partner (&quot;I never want to cool off! NEVER!&quot;). If your blood boils about J. Edgar Hoover or you demand absolute historical accuracy from any film depicting real people and events, you&apos;ll hate this. But if you like Jimmy Stewart, you&apos;ll certainly find things to enjoy here. He&apos;s really the whole show. Whether he&apos;s taking on the KKK, gangsters, and Commies or just getting ticked off at his kids, he&apos;s fun to watch. It&apos;s a little long but never boring.",

      "reviewBody": "So you&apos;ve done a great piece of work, and are awaiting your just rewards. Somehow along the way, someone else, by colour, creed, or connections, get all the recognition that you&apos;re due credit for. You feel frustrated, but you think of your rice bowl, and decide to grit your teeth and bear it, calling it just another day, secretly longing for a time where you are empowered to do something about it.\n\nIn the liberation of France during WWII, North African men were recruited and enlisted in the French army in the fight against the Nazis. Why do they do it? One reason is to escape poverty, and the holding on to the glimmer of hope that they can be accepted, when the war is over, as equals based on their fight for the &quot;motherland&quot;. These soldiers, mujahedeens, fought hard, often being in the frontline, but always overlooked when it comes to recognition of basic military welfare and promotions, not that these rewards will cost an arm or a leg, nor are the fighters so hard up for them. All they&apos;re asking for was fair treatment, but all they got was discrimination.\n\nYes, and that is the pain. WWII movies are aplenty, but Days of Glory offered a unique look at the battles by a group of men, for what they deem their motherland and will defend with their blood, and what more, for a land of people who do not see them as equals. Loving someone who does not love you back, sounds familiar? And it&apos;s not just love, but sworn allegiance to protect at all costs.\n\nThe movie is well paced and straddled moments of action and quiet contemplation with aplomb. Credit must go to the ensemble cast of actors who play the warriors of North Africa, as they battle both the enemies on French soil, as well as enemies of men&apos;s heart. They grapple with trying to remain rational in their reason(s) to do what they&apos;re doing.\n\nAt times, watching this movie made me think about the recent flurry of mails to the press about foreign talent and the issue of citizenship, about NS obligations and whether PRs will flee at the first signs of trouble, or stand shoulder to shoulder with citizens (also, who are those who will flee?) in defending our land. What are the issues of contention, discrimination against, or general presumptions about foreigners here?\n\nThose expecting all out battle scenes might be disappointed. In truth the movie&apos;s never about the glorification of gore, violence and war - most scenes aren&apos;t really blood splattering to draw in the crowds. Instead, if you&apos;d prefer moments where you can think out loud about the issues presented, then this is for you. However, the final battle would please action fans, as it is well choreographed and executed, and you feel both the pain and victory from a bunch of tightly knit soldiers trying their very best to defend a small town, in a samurai- seven-ish sort of way, also reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan&apos;s somehow.\n\nIf you&apos;ve missed this during the French Film Festival, don&apos;t fret. I believe this movie is also slated for general release. Keep a look out for it!",

At first I thought I got some kind of cheesy ghost-busting anime with weird-looking synthesis of computer graphics and regular animation. But if you can accept (or endure) occasional splashes of barrel and spell fighting you&apos;ll find in this movie an engrossing love drama with interesting plot turns and a bunch of original art. Although the mage characters seem to be low grade in comparison to two main ones the battle system mechanics is pretty interesting too and quite detailed. So after all &apos;low-gradeness&apos; of mages could be a trick to make main characters stand out.\n\nThis version of the story is WAY better than any real movie interpretations. Very recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Whenever I see a negative review of &quot;I Saw the Devil&quot;, the critic always mentions (scornfully) that the movie is ultra violent and portrays women in horrifying circumstances. Yes it is, and yes it does.\n\nBut this isn&apos;t a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren&apos;t meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or &quot;cool&quot; about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one&apos;s mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on-screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.\n\nBut enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close-ups of both Byung-hun Lee and Mik-sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.\n\nThe story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee&apos;s character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi&apos;s character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between &quot;victim&quot; and &quot;aggressor&quot; becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in &quot;I Saw the Devil&quot;; the viewer is left with shades of grey.\n\nAs for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee&apos;s character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.\n\nAs for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn&apos;t make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it&apos;s a very trivial complaint that isn&apos;t worth a deducted point.\n\nA confident 10/10 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.",

In short, one of the most powerful mind screwer but he&apos;s just gunning for short cash robberies with his Dad as a small time outlaw. Makes no sense, and the script tries to sell our protagonist as a simple fish out of water. The &quot;perceiver&quot; is a dude in 70s glasses who makes a visible effort to have a brooding angry mug on his face, to the point where you wonder whether this really is a parody.\n\nThe acting is generally stilted and not very good. Part of it is just the terrible dialog. This may have been an Amazon production, which explains the money behind it and the generic paint by numbers script where it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s all about putting some &apos;cool scifi concept&apos; on screen and the characters themselves are props. No background on any of them because the audience doesn&apos;t have to care. It&apos;s all about unlocking this mystery which is... in Warsaw. Why? Because obviously a production budget goes way further in Eastern Europe.\n\nThere is a scene where our hero is caught by a character and an encounter ensuses. Like the rest of this film, it makes little sense. And at that point, about halfway through, I was about ready to call it quits until I remembered I could just jump ahead... So...\n\nOn the bright side, going straight to video allows you to quickly skip ahead, if you actually care about what happens.",

      "reviewBody": "Banking on Heaven is about the horrors of polygamy in Colorado City, Arizona where women as young as thirteen are forced into marriages with older men. You have seen the images lately as the siege in El Dorado, Texas at the other compound separated the children from their mothers who look like Laura Ingalls Wilder. First, the women are bred and born into this religion and believe what the prophet or leader has told them about the outside world. The women and children are equally suffering enough in the polygamist lifestyle while their husbands reap the benefits of a patriarchal system from another time and era. It&apos;s hard to believe that this is still going on in America but it is. As we hear about the children being ripped apart by their mothers who are as clueless in El Dorado, Texas, polygamy must be stopped more vigilantly even with the banned in the Mormon Church. The Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints or FLDS believe that all others are gentiles even Mormons. I fear another Jonestown and if gay marriage (which I support) gets legalized that it would open the door to the legalization of polygamy. Laurie Allen does a remarkable job but it&apos;s not enough. This film should have won an Oscar. It should have been more publicized. Maybe because it&apos;s in our backyard, maybe Americans want the romanticized view of polygamy like in the show, Big Love. That&apos;s Hollywood! This is real. There is abuse of all sorts here. When you hear the former wives and mothers especially Ruth Cooke who was forced into exile because she wanted to save her daughter from sexual abuse and was placed in a mental hospital. On the streets, strangers such as beggars became her unlikely support. I found it interesting that the cast is not listed here. British born Arizona State Senator Linda Bader was in for awakening. We must not forget that the women and children are born and bred into this patriarchal dictatorship in America&apos;s backyard. The members are completely brainwashed as in Waco and Jonestown. Laurie Allen has first-hand experience. I admire her courage to bring polygamy to the forefront. Documentaries don&apos;t make money unless you&apos;re Michael Moore. This documentary was a labor of love for Laurie Allen and everybody involved. It should have won an Academy Award or have been nominated. They risked their lives to get the remarkable footage of the closed insular community of Colorado City, Arizona.",

The pacing could be tighter, the adaptation of Deighton&apos;s exemplary novel - one of his best - could be a little more fluid but generally the thing works well.\n\nFor fans of the novels this is perhaps the most interesting of the three movies. Ipcress is a fascinating spin on the its novel&apos;s central theme, Brain is an awful adaptation of a lack-lustre book but Funeral in Berlin sticks to the original story pretty firmly until it turns on you with a very groovy twist indeed."

Ad√®le has an agreement with Professor Marie-Joseph Esp√©randieu (Jacky Nercessian) that has the ability of bringing the dead back to life to resurrect the doctor to heel her twin sister Agathe Blanc-Sec (Laure de Clermont), who has been catatonic and paraplegic for five years due to an accident caused by Ad√®le. However, Professor Esp√©randieu is arrested in prison and sentenced to death after bringing to life a pterodactyl from an ancient egg in Louvre that caused the death of three persons. Now the last hope of Agathe is that Ad√®le saves Professor Esp√©randieu from the guillotine.\n\n&quot;Les Aventures Extraordinaires d&apos;Ad√®le Blanc-Sec&quot; is a highly entertaining and funny adventure by Luc Besson. Last week, I was zapping the television and I saw the last part of the adventure of Ad√®le Blanc- Sec. Today I have just watched this movie on DVD with my family and we really enjoyed the story. The weird and bizarre characters slightly recall the surrealism of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet in &quot;Delicatessen and &quot;La Cit√© des Enfants Perdus&quot;.

Wesley Snipes turns in another passenger 57ish performance, not great but competent. and Gary Busey is always competent playing a guy you always want to die no matter how bad the plot gets.\n\nThe movie however, is worth watching more than other bland action movies because firstly, the skydiving scenes are shot wonderfully. The cinematographer and the stuntpeople (unless thats Snipes in a free fall, which i doubt) are the true stars of this one. I really enjoyed watching the skydiving sequences in this movie.\n\nplot wise, the movie kinda plods along, not a whole lot of suspense but enough of a story to keep people entertained. I think its worth watching at least once, purely for the skydiving and action sequences.\n\nAlso, besides being a fairly competent actress - one I can actually believe skydives -  Yancy Butler is really hot."

      "reviewBody": "As with any film which follows a beloved mini-series it is nearly impossible to escape the shadow. When watching this film you&apos;ll find yourself constantly comparing it to the mini-series and more often than not the memory of the mini-series comes out ahead.\n\nThat being said, I still very much enjoyed the film. As with other recent English remakes (Pride &amp; Prejudice, BBC&apos;s Sense &amp; Sensibility) you really appreciate the beauty of modern film making. The cinematography, the score, and the ever beautiful Castle Howard, Venice, and Oxford alone are worth the watching in my opinion. There are also some great performances. Matthew Goode&apos;s Charles rivals that of Jeremy Iron&apos;s, Hayley Atwell&apos;s Julia (in a more central role than that of the mini-series) was also quite good. I also found myself rather enjoying Charles&apos; wife Celia (Anna Madeley) even in such a small role.\n\nThe real failure of the film seems to be the difficulty with compressing 11 hours into 2. Everything is forced to move faster and the more quite, gentle, and simple scenes are lost. What&apos;s left then is a distillation of the most dramatic moments. As a result the film loses the subtlety of the mini-series. The religious bits are played up a bit too much and makes the characters slightly unbelievable. Emma Thompson is great as always, but her character of Lady Marchmain as written is too over bearing, too controlling, too inhuman. The character of Sebastian is louder than in the mini-series and becomes jaded before you care much for him. Indeed, I didn&apos;t find myself caring particularly much for any of the characters except perhaps Charles.\n\nStill, if you don&apos;t have 11 hours on hand to spend watching the mini-series, this is a suitable substitute and is worth watching at least once at any rate. As long as you don&apos;t go in expecting an equal to the mini-series you&apos;ll enjoy it and may even find a moment or two which improves upon the original.",

The acting is great although the acting is not always spot on in every possible scene but those exceptions aren&apos;t that many. The music is absolutely exceptional throughout the film.\n\nMy biggest strife with movies is usually predictable dialogue and sloppy editing, with 2 camera angles where you can see that the movement wasn&apos;t fluid. This movie had neither. The movie even had its own side-story plot that tied within the main characters&apos; stories. Movies based on novels are usually hard in execution but this one pulled it off. It even has some decent visual effects and nice cinematography with crisp camera work.\n\nFun, thrilling, mean, heartwarming and sad with a heart of gold. It&apos;s always a good feeling to be reminded of what it was like to be a care-free kid with your friends.",

      "reviewBody": "Writers-directors Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft structured this documentary in an unusual way by offering the actual words from Joseph Goebbels&apos;s 1924-1945 diaries. \n\nGoebbels&apos;s word are spoken by the gifted British actor-director Kenneth Branagh, who unfortunately reads them as if he were just passing through town and needed a few extra bucks. Goebbels was a man of mercurial emotion, but that&apos;s hard to pick up from Branagh&apos;s rapid-fire and seemingly diffident delivery.\n\nThe film&apos;s structure leads to bigger problems: there are too many glaring omissions of crucial events in world history. A second narrator should have been used to fill in these gaps.\n\nThe examples of omission are numerous. We get a mere passing glance at the invasion of Poland, the event that was singularly responsible for launching World War II in Europe. We barely see the violent roundup of Jews all over the country, although Goebbels wrote often about his hatred of the &apos;Juden&apos;. \n\nThe Battle of Britain, a critical early turning point in the war that is often credited with dissuading Hitler from invading England, is not even mentioned. The war on the eastern front with Russia is barely examined, we hear only scant mention of D-Day, there is no reference to the famous attempt on Hitler&apos;s life, and the film abruptly ends in less than five minutes with the pristine bodies of Goebbels&apos;s children and his own charred corpse.\n\nThe film does work as an examination of Goebbels&apos;s exasperation and frustrated self-importance (he saw himself as a possible Fuhrer). His smugness and arrogance are noted throughout in his diaries. He imagines himself as a &apos;new&apos; Dostoyevsky, he deems the brilliant cinematographer-propagandist Leni Reifenstahl as an irritating &apos;minor&apos; talent, he scoffs at Goering, Himmler and others, and he fairly glows when Der Adolph pats him on the back.\n\nJoseph Goebbels and his &apos;philosophy&apos; of propaganda (repeat lies often enough and they will eventually be interpreted by the public as truth) are alive and well in our society. Goebbels may be dead, but his ideas, in different forms, live on.",

Almost has a &apos;porno-like&apos; quality and feel to it. Also, has way too much back-story and way, way too much over explanation. In a nut shell, it goes something like this...some scientists on an island are trying to create the cure for cancer but they create some kind of reanimation formula and to top it off...they let this voodoo guy&apos;s daughter die...so, the voodoo guy sends his wife to hell and she comes back as a demon-like thing and everybody tries to run away, but the Ninja Ghouls get them...oh except for this little girl who wobbles away then starts to stop wobbling...but she continues and somehow finds a travel agent and gets off the island (I&apos;m guessing because they don&apos;t show this). Anyway, I guess, we flash forward to when this little girl is all growed up, but I don&apos;t know because nobody says so and they don&apos;t even have the little &apos;20 Years Later&apos; graphic appear on the screen...where was I? Oh yeah, so, this growed up little girl comes back to the island...I&apos;m not sure why...to find her parents bodies or something? But she came prepared...she has a bunch of angry army guys with her and one guy is so tough that he actually chases a zombie down and starts to beat him up for no good reason. Also, these two tough guys and a girl stroll into town...I don&apos;t know where they came from either, nor what town they&apos;re walking through...oh and one is wearing glasses which makes him smart. I think they must have used the little girls travel agent. Then people start getting torn apart...basically introduced then torn apart, to the point where it appears quite random. After people are torn apart...they come back and taunt their old friends...these are very mean spirited zombies. Where was I? I don&apos;t know...watch it and I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll know either!",

Andy is the pride and joy of Christine that has eyes only for him. When the Brooks family is having dinner, they receive an Army¬¥s letter telling that Andy died in the war. However a couple of days later, Andy arrives at home late night surprising his father Charles (John Marley), his sister Cathy (Anya Ormsby) and Christine. In the same night, a truck driver that is giving a rider to a hitchhiker is murdered in his truck. Soon Charles suspects that Andy is the killer and he has a conversation with his friend Doctor Allman (Henderson Forsythe) that agrees with him. Does Andy really come back home?\n\n&quot;Dead of Night&quot; is a creepy and depressing horror movie directed by Bob Clark. The story is sad, with family, friends and girlfriend missing a twenty-one year-old missing in Vietnam. His return as an undead killer is depressing and bringing tragedy for those who loves him. Richard Backus is creepy in the role of Andy. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Sonho de Morte&quot; (&quot;Deathdream&quot;)",

As a gay man I was terrified the film would fall into gay bashing and ridicule and whilst there are some strong stereotypes represented the overall charm and message of the film is delightful. Michael Caton is terrific as Ralph, a simple mechanic from small town Australian. Ralph is the type of bloke we all want as our uncle. Honest, dependable and while a bit conservative, a man with a heart of gold. Paul Hogan (forgive me all you Hogan haters) is wonderful! I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this but the man many of us have grown to hate gives a lovely performance as Vince, the local cinema owner. &apos;Hoges&apos; surprisingly gives the film real heart and shows a vulnerability I haven&apos;t seen him show before in his other work. I won&apos;t go through the story points again, other than saying Strange Bedfellows is a hilarious, grossly underrated Aussie movie and one that I&apos;m sure will find a very loyal audience from straight, gay, lesbian, transgender movie lovers who will see this film in the spirit the filmmakers obviously made it to be. Good luck to it!",

Escaping with his gun, Brett vows to return and find the real thief. On his journey, he encounters Lucy, a girl kidnapped and tortured during a stagecoach attack.\n\nDespite helping Lucy, Brett faces suspicion in the nearest town as the real culprits are still at large. Lucy identifies the thieves, including Gil Clawson. One of them, Avery Ranchester, is the son of influential Clayton Ranchester. The trio tries to silence Lucy, kidnapping Brett to stage an escape. Brett escapes, kills one bandit, and flees with Lucy, while Clayton Ranchester turns the crowd against Brett, sparking a mountain manhunt.\n\nAdios Gringo is a thoroughly gripping western that has a hard edge and a certain depth to the characters. There&apos;s action but close attention is paid to the plot and characterisation. The pace never falters nor does the challenges for the hero. The hero, of course, is Guiliano Gemma who is a likeable and sympathetic character. His gentleness to the Lucy after her ordeal is touching. The supporting cast includes Nello Pazzafini as the villainous Jack Dawson, Roberto Camardiel as a doctor and Evelyn Stewart as Lucy, all deliver really well. I liked the sheriff - who was a little reluctant to help as he doesn&apos;t want to rock the boat and lose his job but finally does the right thing- and the doctor working together to help Brett and Lucy - it was a fun aspect. The finale is a tense showstopper.",

I first thought my DVD players was messed up.  It wasn&apos;t.  If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white.  If you don&apos;t you will never be able to get through the film.  If you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction.",

His attention to detail and painstaking care when researching this role was evident from his stunning performance. He is certainly someone we need to be looking out for in the future and has an illustrious movie career ahead of him I&apos;m sure.

It may seem to be shot in an old-fashioned manner, but it is a pretty interesting production. \n\nThe atmosphere in this movie may seem quite eerie. Indeed it appears to be quite depressing - especially during the events happening in the sleazy den. The cast is good. Eugeniusz Kujawski handles his dual role very well. You may want to check out &quot;Dom Sary&quot; (1985) with him as well. \n\nPlot: Wanda is experiencing regular visits from a mysterious man who abuses her while her husband (Prof. Czelawa) is asleep next to her. She consults Dr Janusz Stocki about this as she thinks these are hallucinations. Stocki - a psychiatrist - uses hypnosis to find out that these visits are for real. He further investigates these findings to discover that there is an immoral man in the city who looks exactly like Czelawa but is called Stachur. Stachur and Stocki, when they finally meet each other, engage in a psychological battle which ends with an unusual resolution.",

I thought it was going to be a heavy dark film - and it might be on one level - but it&apos;s not at all on the other, mainly because it is about seeing the (&apos;grown up&apos;) world from a child&apos;s point of view. It reminded me a bit of Pan&apos;s Labyrinth in that way, i.e. the way there is an &apos;adults world&apos; and a &apos;child&apos;s world&apos;, although Pan&apos;s Labyrinth focuses more on childhood escapism, but &apos;Blame in Fidel&apos; is more about childhood realism. That is to say this film focuses, in a really lovely accurate way, on a child struggling to understand the real world around them, especially when the adults around her don&apos;t tell her the full story. There is no fantasy here. It&apos;s all very real. Anna clearly wants to understand what&apos;s going on. She hears snippets of conversations and tries to put it all together, sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly. Definitely worth a watch!",

This movie comes from his glory days before the scandal with his adopted daughter eclipsed his U.S. career.\n\nHere is vintage Woody. A fecund imagination married to a masterful story-telling talent.\n\nLike &apos;The Purple Rose of Cairo&apos; (his masterpiece in my estimation) this is pure fantasy and it is delightful. Mia Farrow has done nothing finer, equal to her portrayal in Polanski&apos;s &apos;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&apos; though of a completely different genre.\n\nThe little socio-political messages do not interfere with what is otherwise a nifty little love story between Alice and Joe Mantagna. Things don&apos;t quite work out in the end, as is usual in a Woody movie, but they are on the border of real-life possibility and add the bittersweet note that he is so good at.\n\nI love this movie. It is not one of his rocking comedies like &apos;Broadway Danny Rose&apos; but is a sweet vignette. It has overtones of &apos;Diary of Mad Housewife&apos; but with a happier ending, for the housewife anyway.\n\nThe scenes with Keye Luke, Alice&apos;s magical Eastern physician are subtle and funny. The fantasy scenes with Alec Baldwin&apos;s dead lover and the wonderful Bernadette Peters&apos; muse are enchanting. Peters&apos; Bronx-like muse is especially funny.\n\nDon&apos;t miss it."

It would appear that the budget was quite low, which, when combined with the live aspects make this look like a you tube video.\n\nJason Flemyng is arguably miscast as Quatermass, although it might be argued that this incompetent production doesn&apos;t give him a fair chance.\n\nDavid Tennant fares a little better , but of the rest of the cast the females are the only ones who seem to be even trying. Isla Blair and Indira varma bring a bit of much needed credibility to the proceedings.\n\nThe really big problem is Richard Fell&apos;s awful script which is amateurish in every imaginable way. When listening to the dialogue one imagines of the writer or director have ever heard real people speak. Fail.",

I was also surprised at how little controversy was shown about that fact. But during the course of the movie, comparison of materials (from a single source or not), ballistics evidence, weapon edge evidence and more are all showcased. Not quite a commercial for police as scientific marvels, seeing as how another part of the main story involves whether or not police ought to be able to rough up criminals or not, but considering how far before the Miranda ruling this movie was made, it now comes across as an interesting look at the state of forensics in the late 1930s. For true devotees of The New Detectives (and maybe CSI, though it has little to do with crime scenes per se), this is certainly an interesting title.",

Not only is he preparing her for the state spelling bee competition, but Saul is also training his daughter to be the mystic he wasn&apos;t able to become. Bee Season is not only a movie about meditation, but it is also itself a meditation. This family is consumed with finding God, but they all look outside of the family to find it, and in the process, the family falls apart. Eliza&apos;s older brother Aaron (Max Minghella) is so jealous that his sister is getting all of the family&apos;s attention that he goes off and joins a Buddhist cult, and everyone in the family is so focused on their own problems that no one notices the mother (Juliette Binoche) going slowly insane! Bee Season is transcendent and thought-provoking, and it even makes me want to go out and look for God.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s this dead guy lying in the morgue with a bullet in his chest. I think you might have been the one who shot him. The guy&apos;s wife agrees with me. So does the District Attorney.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nIn the world of Michael Moore, he would be allowed to file a &apos;Friend of the Court&apos; briefing on celluloid and your guilt or innocence would be decided by that alone. But in this country, we have a trial. The prosecution presents its case, and then the defense calls out errors in the prosecution&apos;s logic, problematic witnesses and inconsistencies in the timeline. Then the prosecution gets to call out how the defense is taking things out of context¬Öback and forth it goes.\n\nThe DA is not supposed to be objective. If he becomes aware of something that would suggest your innocence, he is not obligated to come forward with it.\n\nThe defense is also biased. If he knows you shot the guy, he&apos;s not supposed to give the evidence to the court or the prosecution.\n\nSo both parties are expected to work toward a singular goal: Getting the outcome they want. It is impossible for both of them to achieve this. This is not a perfect way to get to the truth, but it&apos;s the very best way there is. So all the Michael Moore fans out there whining and sniveling about &apos;the &apos;no terrorist threat&apos; remark was taken out of context&apos; and &apos;FahrenHYPE has become exactly what it decries&apos; are whistling in the wind.\n\nWhat this film did was yank Michael Moore out of the &apos;judge&apos;s&apos; chair, and reduce him to being just one of two diametrically opposed advocates. This is good. Most of us, and I do mean nearly all thinking people who were paying attention, are far more comfortable with Moore in the role of one of the advocates, instead of him simply telling people what to think. For one thing, this makes him truly accountable for the factual distortions in his material, regardless of whether the distortions were intentional or not. So liberals, it might make you look good to your fellow liberals to go on about &apos;it became exactly what it&apos;s complaining about&apos; but this idea misses the point: Moore has freedom of speech, and so do people who disagree with him.\n\nWhat&apos;s written above deals with how FahrenHYPE affects the political dialog in our nation. What is written below, deals with quality and whether it&apos;s worth seeing.\n\nWell, the election is over, so this is a peek in the rear-view mirror but you already know that. The film has been attacked for being a mouthpiece of conservatives, but this is incorrect. It&apos;s very obvious someone has gone to considerable trouble to recruit democrats into the project. This is powerful. Here is Clinton&apos;s political adviser, a distinguished senator from Georgia, a school principal who didn&apos;t vote for Bush, and a famous former mayor of New York. All Democrats, and all of them taking considerable time and trouble to appear in a documentary refuting the work of Michael Moore, narrated by a liberal Hollywood actor.\n\nAfter the film shoots down point by point the issues that Fahrenheit was trying to raise, you&apos;ll see a pattern emerge: Michael Moore has a tactic of presenting only the side of the story he wants to present. There is no big surprise here, after all this is something we &apos;know&apos; about documentaries. The thing of it is, though, we may &apos;know&apos; of the tactic but it is difficult to achieve a reckoning of how much damage this can do to the truth, or how convincing a documentary can be when the material therein is deceptive. This is going to come as a surprise to the Michael Moore fans, especially to the ones who have been memorizing the Fahrenheit arguments and repeating them word for word in the e-mail, thread postings, and chat rooms. This is why (see above) you want to have two diametrically opposite advocates each attacking the weaknesses in the arguments of the other, when you really want to learn the truth.\n\nAnd you should let that process go for awhile, before repeating what someone said.\n\nI suspect many of the Michael Moore fans who say they didn&apos;t like this film, are quietly undergoing a subtle change in their habits of parroting the Fahrenheit arguments wherever they can. They may not like the direction in which this film leaned, and they&apos;ll never admit to anyone they learned a valuable lesson, but learn it they did. It can be hazardous to willingly become a walking sandwich board for someone else, especially someone with as fragile a reputation for telling the truth as Michael Moore.\n\nSo yes it&apos;s worth seeing. If you&apos;re prejudiced against Michael Moore, you probably have a lot of liberal buddies constantly badgering you about &apos;did you see it yet, did you see it yet&apos; insinuating that you&apos;re &apos;ignorant&apos; until you have seen Michael&apos;s &apos;documentary.&apos; Well now you can tell them you saw a documentary of the documentary ¬ñ did THEY see it? And you didn&apos;t give Michael Moore one single dime out of your pocket.\n\nAnd as I&apos;ve written already, if you&apos;re prejudiced in favor of Moore ¬ñ there is a lesson for you here. I suspect the most loudmouthed among the Michael Moore fans are going to nervously scan through this piece, just to get a feel for how much they&apos;ve been had. Now that you&apos;ve echoed some of the lies and distortions in Fahrenheit, it&apos;s better to get a heads-up on how someone is going to nail you to the wall on it, than to let the nailing proceed while being completely oblivious to how it&apos;s going to come about."

There&apos;s no way you can sit through the whole sci-fi/western/inexplicable noise-packed experience without either beginning to love it or snapping and attacking bystanders with the remote.\n\nIt&apos;s less of a movie and more of a game, to be honest.  See how long *you* can stand the bizarre whirring sounds, played whenever each and every &apos;robotic&apos; (translated from Low-Budget:  contact lenses and metal gloves) character moves.  Even when their eyes move, for god&apos;s sake! It&apos;s half endurance test, and half bad, bad movie.  But watch it anyway."

      "reviewBody": "As I watched French citizens digging up unexploded shells from WWI, it seemed almost incomprehensible to think of the task they still have ahead of them.  Millions of shells were fired in that war and one out of every eight didn&apos;t explode.  Thousands of those live shells are still buried in the forests and farmlands of France, and every year, several people are wounded or killed by these bombs that are nearly a century old.  This film also documents the hundreds of thousands of unexploded shells and live mines still surrounding populated villages in Russia and Bosnia, and  the effects still prevalent in Vietnam of Agent Orange.  It&apos;s a fascinating documentary, and the interviews with the folks who live with these lurking dangers brings a human touch that defines bravery in measurements we rarely see.  I was sort of surprised to see that the film didn&apos;t cover the estimated 8 to 24 million unexploded cluster bombs still scattered throughout Laos that to date have killed over 5,700 and injured over 5,600.  Nor does it cover the fact that nations today are knowingly using weapons whose destructive capabilities will still be viable for thousands of years.  In Bosnia, Kuwait and Southern Iraq, the US and Britain used weapons made from uranium-238 (depleted uranium), which upon impact vaporizes into fine dust and gas that causes both heavy-metal poisoning and irradiation to anyone nearby. During the Persian Gulf War, three hundred tons of U-238 were spread over Kuwait and Southern Iraq. According to a US Department of Defense survey, more than 436,000 US troops have entered contaminated battlefields.  How many Iraqis have been exposed to date no one knows but the fact that hundreds of Iraqis have scavenged the wreckage of tanks and jeeps and sold the contaminated scrap metal they salvaged throughout Southern Iraq, just boggles the imagination.  As of today, over 140,000 US soldiers from the Persian Gulf War have filed for disability, and over 9,600 have died.  These weapons are still being used.  [IMDb&apos;s guidelines ask us to refrain from listing URLs, but one can look up the sources for this information on any search engine: The National Gulf War Resource Center, The Military Toxic Project, The Cluster Munition Coalition, and The Center for Defense Information]\n\nStill, this film is excellent, fascinating and vitally important viewing for everybody, and teachers should consider it for children over 12 years of age."

Filmed in Lapland, nearly everyone moves about in this film on skis or reindeer-drawn toboggan. The lonely snow-covered landscapes lightly dotted with trees, humans, and curving herds of reindeer look beautiful in black and white. The film capitalizes on the mythic and mystic nature of the landscape and the land--The Land of the Midnight Sun. What a perfect setting for a film about love, loneliness, fears of abandonment, and, of course, vampires. The horror is a subtle one and even now barely verges on the campy (thanks to the uniqueness of its setting). The strange shots of the sun hovering on the horizon and of reindeer stampeding across the snow only enhance this bizarre tale. The main actress is quite stunning and plays the balance of her role well. A definite treat for fans of foreign or horror films.",

      "reviewBody": "For about the first thirty minutes, I was thinking of some way to politely inform those who recommended this film that it wasn&apos;t my cup of tea, but the more I stayed, the more captivated I became. Based on a stage play that opened six years earlier, Harvey, the 1950 film directed by Henry Koster, is a delight. If this Jimmy Stewart classic doesn&apos;t make you feel good, you must be related to Mr. Henry F. Potter of Bedford Falls. Harvey is a 6&apos; 3&apos;&apos; Pooka who has befriended a certain Mr. Elwood P. Dowd and this causes all sorts of complications for those around him. In case you didn&apos;t know, in Celtic mythology a Pooka is a fearsome spirit that usually takes the form of a sleek dark horse that roams the countryside at night, creating harm and mischief. Well, Harvey is not like that at all.\n\nIn fact, Harvey is a very gentle spirit who is always helping people out and can make everybody around him feel relaxed and in a good mood. Now Dowd needs all the help he can get. He likes to take a nip once in a while and is always talking to that danged rabbit to the chagrin of his sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull) whose social life takes a nosedive when brother Elwood is around. Elwood&apos;s shenanigans also interfere with her plans to marry off her daughter Myrtle Mae (Victoria Home). When Veta decides that she has had enough and tries to commit Elwood to a psychiatric institution, the tables are turned and she ends up being committed in a hilarious case of mistaken identity. When Elwood leaves the hospital after being released, the medical staff in the hospital (a bit eccentric themselves) realize their mistake and all try to find him.\n\nThe madcap beginning soon turns into a gentle and moving drama. Jimmy Stewart is flawless as the decent man who never loses his temper and always has a smile on his face, giving everyone his card and inviting strangers home for dinner. The supporting cast is top notch as well including the unpleasant Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway), the egotistical psychiatrist Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake), his love struck assistant Miss Kelley (Peggy Dow) and the overwrought orderly (Jesse White, later known as the Maytag repairman).\n\nEventually some that ridiculed Elwood and his rabbit privately admit that they could see Harvey themselves and by the end we are gradually convinced that the so-called normal people may be stranger than Mr. Dowd. Harvey is considered a classic and with good reason. It works because of its good-natured humor and its gentle slap at those who automatically condemn ideas that are outside socially acceptable norms without thinking for themselves.",

The script is full of catty one-liners but none of it is worthy of Dunne&apos;s presence. She did much better with screwball comedy material that came later.\n\nA serious waste of time with a weak first half-hour that only picks up steam when Constance Cummings enters the scene. Ralph Bellamy is a bore as a bumbling husband in one of his rare leading man roles.\n\nSumming up: Only for serious Irene Dunne fans.",

      "reviewBody": "As the 3rd film of the Swordsman trilogy I found that I wondered why they bothered to make it at all; as it did nothing to compliment the first 2 in the trilogy! I have been watching Chinese films, for over 35 years now, and this is top of my worst Chinese films ever made (and that is really saying something when you consider the copious amounts of sheer lying rubbish in propaganda films they put out)! As I do not speak any Chinese whatsoever I had to rely upon English subtitles (all that are available on the internet are absolutely terrible) and, I could find only one translation which was utterly terrible (it was like a broke broken mistranslated gobbledygook); it was not translated by a person who could speak both languages but more likely machine based etc. So it made the film even worse to view.\n\nIt continues from where the 2nd film left off (the actors being Brigitte Lin- once again - and the superb Jet Li) but is completely confusing, badly edited and a lousy story-line/script etc. It jumped all over the place with far too much fantasy action thrown in; which was in fact so stupid/bad in its look on the screen. It was like the director and co didn&apos;t have a clue what to do with the story, actors roles, action and continuity of the first 2 films. The films of this era (and 20 plus years before) used Hi-wire and off screen equipment - trampolines etc - for special FX; the CGI of the era you could say. The problem is it is vastly overused and looks terrible in every shot! As a long time viewer of Chinese martial Arts films I am used to the special FX used at the time and that&apos;s how I know that these were cheap looking and just terrible!\n\nOne of the reviewers tries to entice you to watch it by saying that there is a fantastic lesbian love scene...what a click-baiting liar! The scene is between the goddess, Brigitte Lin, and her concubine, Snow (who turns out to be a demon in disguise) who are fully clothed in a scene that lasts about 4 seconds.\n\nI surprised there are so many likes for this film by the reviewers because the film to me played out as though it had been made by a clueless teenager...a young one at that! Its gotten a 1 star from me, only because I have too give it mark of some level, but the only nice thing about this film is looking at the beautiful Brigitte Lin!",

This movie here is the German movie equivalent to this series.\n\nA young policemen&apos;s (played by a brilliant Bernd-Michael Lade) dreams of the big city are squandered when he finds himself stranded in the flatlands of rural northern Germany, where live is boring, the weather is miserable and prospects of evening entertainment are non-existing. Similar to Dr. Fleischman, young K√∂pper has to grow up and learn to deal with his situation and his surroundings. Throw in dry northern German humor, a few murdered cows and the typical German attitude towards police and you arrive at one of the best German movies of its time.\n\nIf you have lived in northern Germany and have experienced the monotony of the landscape and the way of live up there, you will find this movie a real treat; if not, you can still get a good one and a half hours of entertainment out of it. I am waiting for the release of Karniggels on DVD, but considering that northern Germany is not one of the most favorite places and hardly anyone has heard of this film, I am not holding my breath.",

It was a good decision - the movie is typical for its times with it&apos;s bad lightning, unnormalized sound, ugly chain-smoking people and grim settings - but these factors turn out to be advantages as they combine with good script and remarkable acting to form a honest and realistic picture. Jerzy Stuhr never fails to deliver and is as usual a pleasure to watch as he strives to defend the values of culture and education while the school is being dominated by the sports coach, whose ambitions create a chance for a success in a tournament - but who seems to be using the team to win what he had lost. The movie well depicts the ways of gaining power in communist Poland and the struggle of people like Stuhr&apos;s character to do the right thing in such an environment.\n\nAlthough overshadowed by many good polish movies from late 70&apos;s, it definitely stands out above the rest. Recommended for lovers of east-European cinema and locals alike.",

      "name": "When I wrote Santa Sangre...",
      "reviewBody": "(translation from Italian) In these days, Santa Sangre is back on the screens in a copy restored in 4k in the original version for the 30th anniversary of its release. Many have asked me to review it, but I can&apos;t do it because, first of all I wrote it together with Alessandro Jodorowsky and therefore it would seem to me not very polite and professional to praise me or to criticize me because then in a possible critical judgment today I could also be very bad towards myself... Beyond the jokes, what I can do instead it&apos;s telling the genesis of the film, without spoiling it and without weaving neither praise nor criticism, but leaving them both to the judgment of the spectators, above all new spectators, because it is a cult movie and has gone through 30 years unscathed. Even the famous GB magazine Empire has included it among the 500 best films of all time... Beyond this exaggeration, it can be interesting just how the film was born and meanwhile special thanks goes to Claudio Argento, the &quot;crazy&quot; producer, wonderfully crazy, because he believed in this story and produced it. The first idea of this film has a distant origin. I attended university working in the library of a psychiatric hospital and I was in contact with the so-called madness, with mental illness, I saw it up close, I read the medical records, I prepared texts for some degree theses... Obviously I have no competence as a psychologist or as a psychiatrist, however, I also followed humanly life of some patients because I was part of therapy program which taught painting and theatre and also another ergotherapy program, that is, work therapy, which offered to the patients the possibility of doing small jobs allowing them to take off their uniform, because then patients were in uniform. Take off their uniform and attend the library meant that in the eyes of a stranger they were treated like normal people. During the program I had some patients that apparently were very quiet, and they were also very cultured and prepared. In fact, this experience made me understand that schizophrenia is often proper a &quot;degeneration of intelligence&quot;, in fact, very often schizophrenics are very clever, very sensitive and very attentive. One of these patients, who worked with me because he knew 3 or 4 languages so he could help me sort the books, because the library had 50,000 volumes of all types and ages, one day started looking sideways and saying: &quot;... &apos;shut up ...&apos; shut up ...&quot; The third time I asked him what happened and he answered me calmly with his calm blue eyes: &quot;No, nothing, I have a voice that tells me to kill you, but don&apos;t worry because I love you. &quot; I was a little uncomfortable, but he reassured me: &quot;No, no, don&apos;t worry, I love you, I don&apos;t listen to it... &quot; Continuing to stare at me with his blue eyes and I was, as far as I could be, calm. The library was very extensive because there were five very large rooms for the 50,000 volumes and it was me and him alone, isolated on a high floor of this immense palace. And I trusted. I trusted his blue eyes, I trusted him his sincere way of telling me &quot;I love you&quot;. Probably this episode, like a small seed, has yielded within my psychology, giving me a sense of confidence, giving me a sense of equality and above all a sense of brotherhood even with mental distress. I found Abel in what might have seemed Cain and this fact so ancestral and so mythical has yielded within me and it is probably the origin of Santa Sangre because over time, I conceived a story in which even the worst demon actually can&apos;t forget he is an angel. Whoever saw Santa Sangre knows that the character I wrote together with Alejandro Jodorowsky is a serial killer, but every time he kills you feel sorry for him that is you are sorry more for him than for the victim just to completely overturn the concept of the brute, of the violent, of the monster, but returning almost to the Latin root &apos;monstrum&apos;, that is, something to see, a curious thing to discover. Because the human soul is an infinite gallery of typologies, it is a very deep mine in which, as the famous verses of De Andr√® say: &quot;... nothing comes from diamonds, but from the manure the flowers are born... &quot; That is, there is in the depths of the soul, even the most horrendous soul, this incredible ability, this little spark... Over time I have developed a story that I told Claudio Argento because it was a time when we worked together. Claudio understood this story and indeed he even added to it things he thought and together we decided to present it to the director who seemed the most suitable to represent it that is Alejandro Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky for about ten years seemed to have disappeared from the international scenes, but Claudio with great diligence and a lot of skill found him and talked to his agent. Alejandro made an appointment in Paris, but he wanted to meet only me. We didn&apos;t understand why, but he said: &quot;I want to meet who wrote this story&quot; I went to meet Alejandro in Paris and in the entrance hall of his agent&apos;s building, while I was going to take the elevator, an elegant man has sprung from the shadows, curious, particular, completely dressed in purple: he also had purple shoes, a purple shirt, the purple tie, he was completely purple. And he said to me: &quot;Oui, c&apos;est moi ...&quot; So, I saw Alejandro for the first time. He didn&apos;t want to go to the agent because it was a place of merchants, instead he told me: &quot;Let&apos;s go to a bar, let&apos;s look at each other and talk&quot; The first thing he asked me was: &quot;When did you write this story?&quot; &quot;About a year ago ...&quot; &quot;When exactly?&quot; &quot;I do not remember...&quot; Then, I remembered that my daughter had a fever and I was telling her stories, then I went to my study, an idea had occurred to me and I started to throw that one down which was the first nucleus of Santa Sangre. Then I said: &quot;It should have been March 29.&quot; &quot;What time did you write it?&quot; &quot;Around half past one or two in the morning ...&quot; &quot;I knew it... ...that night I went to sleep early and the angel of stories has passed over Paris to bring me a story, saw that I slept and continued to Rome, saw that you were awake and gave you the story. But the story was mine and you are a thief! &quot; &quot;But Alejandro, I invented it ...&quot; &quot;No, you are a thief, &apos;tu es un voleur&apos; ...&quot; And since then he called me &apos;ce voleur l√†&apos;, &apos;that thief there&apos; referring to me. This is a very beautiful story because you can understand how every artist in reality has the ability, when he likes something, to take it, to feel it and to think that he really conceived it. Then, Alejandro developed this story with his imagination and his art, also telling me an episode occurred in Mexico City which in some respects had similar characteristics and together we wrote the script by which he then made the film that we all know.",

Of course I have to give credits to other actors as well.Mack Swain as Big Jim McKay is not only a big man, he&apos;s also big at his acting skills. Georgia Hale is as beautiful of woman as she is a great actress. The Gold Rush is filled with marvelous scenes.The most memorable is the shoe-eating scene.Chaplin on the dance floor is also something to remember.Through the movie you can hear the score Chaplin composed to this movie.It works perfectly.Just like the whole movie.It&apos;s pure gold from the beginning till the end."

      "reviewBody": "Transferred from the world of Hollywood to the world of rock music, this latest version of A Star Is Born lacks the glamor of the other two, mainly because the field is a less glamorous one. Nevertheless the role of Esther has attracted only the best of players, from Janet Gaynor to Judy Garland and now Barbra Streisand. That&apos;s a hat trick hard to beat in any field.\n\nIn the other two versions, Fredric March and then James Mason, are a pair of self destructive drunks who when we meet them are on the downward side of their careers and have only one ennobling virtue, their love for Gaynor/Garland. Kris Kristofferson however is a multi-substance abuser and because we&apos;re talking about the rock scene has the groupies attached to him. Unlike in the other two versions, Streisand catches him with one and the whole thing about the pure love loses its potency because of it. However the incident does set him up for his final moment of self destruction.\n\nAll the supporting characters from the other two versions are completely eliminated. Gary Busey has a nice role as Kristofferson&apos;s music arranger who fulfills many of the functions that eliminated characters from the other versions have. The rest of the film&apos;s supporting parts are very undefined which makes this version weaker than the others.\n\nBut for those who are interested in hearing Barbra sing, A Star Is Born will more than satisfy you. The film got an Oscar for the song Evergreen which Kristofferson and Streisand duet and it became one of her best selling records. Judy Garland was similarly served in her version with The Man That Got Away although that song was nominated and did not win.\n\nA Star Is Born is an enduring tale and I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen the last of it. May the next group of players do the story as much justice as the three pairs of co-stars I&apos;ve cited.",

      "reviewBody": "Can a horror remake actually be a good for a change? I mean, how many classic horror flicks does Hollywood have to crap on until they finally give up? &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;Amityville Horror&quot;, &quot;Nightmare on Elm St.&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;House of Wax&quot;.......all of these films are examples of why i sometimes HATE Hollywood.\n\nFinally......a horror remake that&apos;s WORTH seeing. I must admit, i had some pretty low expectations walking into this, and it did way more than prove me wrong. Initially i thought they were going to make this a straight &apos;B&apos; movie by incorporating tons of humor with their gore, which would have been fine with me, seeing that i love the genre&apos;. But this movie was more fun than funny. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there are some sequences that are funny, but it had more of that &apos;drive-in&apos; appeal to it&apos;s horror. And i loved every bit of it.\n\nIt&apos;s story is pretty basic, and somewhat clich√©&apos;. I mean come on, a vampire living next door. But the weird thing is, it didn&apos;t come off as clich√©&apos;. And i think the biggest contribution to that was the pace of the film. Once you get past the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film, which are kind of dull, the movie quickly begins to morph into a fast paced gore fest. And now looking back on it......if it were not rated R, then this movie would have been stupid, and it would&apos;ve fit in with every other crummy horror remake.\n\nBut the aspect that i appreciated the most was the writing. For once, they didn&apos;t alter any rules to make their film different. They stuck with what already works, and left it up to the actors to make these vampire rules entertaining. And Collin Farrell did just that.\n\nBottom Line.....Of all the horror movies that come out this year, this will probably be the one you will have the most fun at. It&apos;s funny, it&apos;s somewhat scary, but most of all, it&apos;s pretty damn entertaining. It&apos;s one of those movies i would&apos;ve loved to of seen at the drive-in. If your tired of all this &apos;Twilight&apos; crap, which they happen to mention in the movie itself, then this is really a breathe of fresh air to all the TRUE vampire fans.",

      "reviewBody": "After having been given repeated warnings about how bad this film is, I went ahead and watched a borrowed copy. About thirty minutes into the film I had reached a decision: I was enjoying it. While certainly not Oscar-winning material, most people apparently were expecting some kind of cinematic masterpiece rather than what they got, an over-the-top comic book-like action set piece with a modicum of plot to tie together the action sequences.\n\nThe gunkata sequences, closer to Wimmer&apos;s original idea of the form, do not approach the stark and yet orgiastic death-art of Equilibrium, but they&apos;re fun all the same. The movie is full of neat, if improbable, gadgetry, from gravity manipulators to disposable paper cell phones. Nick Chinlund chews a satisfactory amount of scenery without stuffing himself down the viewer&apos;s throat. Milla Jovovich herself manages to use a two-dimensional role to display probably the most range I&apos;ve ever seen her give outside of &quot;The Messenger&quot;, and she was certainly much more attractive in this movie than in any of the others I&apos;ve ever watched her in. All these things contribute to what amounted to a popcorn bowl of a film: not something you&apos;d eat for every meal, but a nice snack for a change of pace when you don&apos;t want something too substantial.\n\nThe problem seems to be that most people can&apos;t just shut off their brains and enjoy a romp once in a while. Would this film ever seriously contend for Best Anything? No. But it certainly does not deserve the almost universal slagging it has gotten since its release. Ignore what you&apos;ve heard, don&apos;t expect too much, and you might just find yourself being entertained for an hour and a half.",

It seems like a many times told story but the way Polednakova approaches to the subject is simply charming. It truly is one of the most original sit-coms I&apos;ve ever seen. Every character has got all the ingredients of a common man you meet on the street. They are not just one-dimensional comic figures (as it happens in most of the sit-coms). Polednakova will introduce every one of them in an inobtrusive way through many hilarious scenes. And you will love them with all their good and bad sides. Also the actor&apos;s performance is wonderful - it seems like they are not acting - they are living it through. Especially Julius Satinsky is cute.\n\nThe film was awarded as the best Czech comedy ever made. That award is rather contradictional since the comedy is the Czech top genre - but it surely is one of the best. It just doesnt have a blind spot - there is always something funny happening there. And the humor is built on the swift dialogues and original situations rather than on various odiousnesses which so often replace the humor in the modern movies. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes the situation comedies!",

The pictures on location are splendid indeed and this odyssey looks like an initiatory journey ,mainly for the mountie.\n\nLike Marilyn Monroe in &quot;river of no return &quot;, Cyd Charisse is a chanteuse in the first sequence ;and there&apos;s also a brat ,who,although no part of the family ,sides with the trapper who urges the shopkeeper to give him chocolate.",

The acting of the entire is truly miserable and the Pavlou&apos;s directing is really, really weak. Luckily his repertoire only exists out of two films! There&apos;s no tension at all and the few action sequences are tame and unexciting. You wouldn&apos;t know if it was a Clive Barker script if it wasn&apos;t for the use of kinky outfits and bizarre sexual undertones. Really, what is the deal with Barker and his obsession for black leather? The overuse of bad music is really annoying and don&apos;t set your hopes on seeing gross-out gore, neither. The only slightly imaginative aspect is the make-up on some of the mutants and even then you get the feeling that they easily could have done more with it. I surely expected a lot more from this film (especially considering the fact it was so hard to track down) but I hope to convince people not to watch it! Transmutations (a.k.a Underworld) definitely is one of the worst 80&apos;s horror movies¬Öand that says a lot!",

Bette claims she was attacked by a friend she has seen only casually until she was forced to &quot;defend&quot; herself against his unwanted advances. Initially, it looks like a slam dunk but when the case is taken to trial, more and more, Bette&apos;s lies get the best of her.\n\nNot a sympathetic character for the most part. There is one chilling scene where she, totally exasperated with having to remember so many lies, makes a confession to her husband. It is a fascinating scene for while you recoil at her seemingly selfish attitude, there is this underlying, reluctant admiration you feel for this woman&apos;s brutal honesty.\n\nExcellent supporting cast all around, most notably, Herbert Marshall as the poor unsuspecting (it appears many men fall under this category when dealing with the Divine Ms. Davis!)husband whose main goal is to support his wife. Now whether she deserves this loyalty is another ugly story.\n\nExcellent mystery with certainly enough twists and turns to keep you totally engrossed in a very good story.\n\n*Just watched it again last night (10/8/2006) - I&apos;m tellin&apos; ya guys - after 900 viewings, the movie still rocks!!!!",

Mr. Rabbey (who looks like he&apos;s always on the verge of losing it) finally cracks and decides to go on a hunting trip. Watch out bad parents cause Mr. Rabbey is on the prowl! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be quite a chore.\n\nWhat makes this film notable was the fact that Joe &quot;Maniac&quot; Spinell made a short promo reel for a film based upon this one. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a t.v. clown(who looks like a pudgy out of shape Edward James Olmos) who avenges his young fans child abuse by going after their parents. Sadly, Mr. Spinell could never find the funds to complete the project. The film was going to be titled Maniac II: &quot;Mister Robbie&quot;. Rabbey or Robbie the similarities are all too close for comfort. Pretty violent for a P.G. movie.\n\nRecommended.",

The pacing is dead slow, probably to stretch it to 2 hours. I find the passion between Coco an Igor not enough, and the jealousy and rivalry between Coco and Katarina not intense enough.\n\nIn the end, the film cuts suddenly into the future then back to 1920, which is confusing. In addition, the ending does not bring so much closure to the story, it would have been good to generously reduce the existing footage and expand on what happens between the two time frames. Though the film is not boring, it is dull and lacking in passion."

Filled with style and inventive camera work that could leave Argento in shame, the movie had a bizarre, interesting story. The pace was slow and lethargic (similar to Franco&apos;s Succubus and Vampyros Lesbos); the music was excellent, including a melancholic jazz tune and a stylish rock score; and the acting was above average: Carroll Baker, as opposite of what many reviewers said, shines in the role of the evil witch (and looks very attractive also), and Isabelle de Funes was a nice revelation. Cult favorite George Eastman is also good in is supporting role. For the sleazy guys, there was also some mild S&amp;M and some T&amp;A, but nothing worth mention . Too bad the director only made this film, as he looked very talented. A 8/10 from me."

      "description": "The S&amp;M Classic Restored, Re-graded, Re-edited and Re-Imagined\r\n\r\nThe line between perverted dreams and fevered reality are torn apart as a beautiful witch (Carroll Baker, Baby Doll) gets her sapphic claws into a beautiful young photographer in this rampant adaptation of the classic Guido Crepax comic-book.\r\nNow 35 years after original release director Corrado Farina has re-edited his film exclusively for Shameless, re-inserting footage cut by both the producers and censors, to bring us for the first time his vision as he would really have liked it seen. Restored, Re-graded, re-edited and re-imagined this is Baba Yaga: The Final Cut on a features-packed UK DVD!\r\n\r\nWhen the beautiful Valentina spurns the advances of the enigmatic witch, a curse is put on her camera and all those who pose for her are damned. Pursued by the sensuous seduction of Baba Yaga at every turn, she must either submit to her S&amp;amp;amp;M desires or confront the repressed lesbian feelings buried deep within. Carnal lust explodes as she must choose between external decadence and staid reality, with her very soul at stake as witchcraft casts its spell.\r\n\r\nCombining the haunting atmosphere of Polanski with the sexual styling of Argento on Crystal Meth, it&apos;s all here: gorgeous lesbians, Nazi fantasies and even sinister sewing machines! Baba Yaga is 70&apos;s Euro-sleaze at its very best, showcasing stunning cinematography and is a must for everyone let down by the distinctly prudish Barbarella when it comes to erotic Euro-comics.\r\n\r\nBaba Yaga: The Final Cut (cert. 18) is released uncut on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment. The new edit of the film will be presented remastered in 1.85:1 with choices of either English or Italian 2.0 sound with optional English subtitles.",

      "reviewBody": "Introducing Howard Armstrong: musician, artist, poet, and inveterate liar. Add these traits together (with charisma to spare) and you have one of those rare, idiosyncratic characters the camera can&apos;t help but fall in love with, the perfect companion for a sixty-minute jaunt through the dingy urban music halls and lonesome childhood haunts of back roads America. In between spontaneous interludes of music Armstrong entertains the viewer with anecdotes, tall tales and priceless banter, and director Terry Zwigoff simply gives him all the space he needs to ham it up in front of the camera. The result is brisk, professional non-fiction movie-making, but too loosely organized to be considered a traditional biography.",

If you criticize that movie, you should give an example of which you compare it with. It is Russian classics, it was enormously popular and for that time it was technologically advanced. A lot of actors went unknown but Oleg Vidov was a star Many young man were envious for him It could be the case of the previous dude The story is completely unknown in US. So is the writer.

      "reviewBody": "Is there a more astounding monument to the bizarreness of the decade known as the seventies than the endless series of &quot;report&quot; films that came from Germany?\n\nThese were pretend documentaries that were really just an excuse to show some skin. The extraordinary thing, though, is that when these were first shown in cinemas, the majority of Germans went to see them. The majority.\n\nIn previous decades, all nudity and sex had been banned from all films except documentaries. This was a huge shot in the arm for pornographers, who only had to slap some pseudo-informative twaddle together in between the sex and not only were these porno flicks legal, they were patronised by a much wider audience. Most people will not go to see a porno movie. But if that porno movie is disguised as a documentary...\n\nWhich brings us to the staggering success of the &quot;report&quot; films. You see, that boneheaded piece of censorship detailed above was such a massive shot in the arm for the same industry that it was supposed to stifle that pornographers kept making pretend-documentaries even after the ban on straight porno was lifted. They kept pretending to make documentaries, and people kept pretending to go to see them for the educational value.\n\nHence, the aforementioned endless stream of &quot;report&quot; documentaries that came out in the &apos;70s - and the endless stream of paying customers who went to see them. The &quot;Schoolgirl-report&quot; series were the main money maker. These films reported to show adults what their daughters were getting up to while their backs were turned. What WERE they getting up to, you ask? Um... sex. Sex with teachers, school mates, girlfriends, doctors, nurses, employers, handymen. This was generally interspersed with obviously staged interviews with random people giving cringe-inducingly stupid responses to questions like &quot;What do you think about young girls having sex with their teachers?&quot;\n\nWhat we have here, &quot;Lehrmadchen-report&quot;, is a spin off from that series that purports to be about &quot;apprentices&quot;, and features six vignettes about different girls (read: softcore porn actresses) having sex at work. Really, it&apos;s just girls having sex at work. One of the bugbears of the &quot;Schoolgirl-report&quot; series was that in the midst of all the ridiculousness there would often be a vignette featuring sexual assault. This would kind of put a damper on the proceedings. &quot;Lehrmadchen-report&quot; gets the rape out of the way with the first vignette, and then it&apos;s back to the ridiculousness.\n\nNot one but two of the remaining stories features a young girl who is sexually harassed by her boss, and ends up getting revenge... while also getting naked. (That&apos;ll show &apos;em). Perhaps the strangest vignette has a girl who winks whenever she gets nervous working as an apprentice aviator (?). Is there such a thing? She keeps going up in airplanes with men who misinterpret her winking as coquetry, and attempt to grope her in the air, which ends in the plane crashing off screen.\n\nMany of the actors and actresses involved are regulars from other &quot;report&quot; movies. Even some of the ugly middle aged men are: there&apos;s one hideous, ratlike little man who is here depicted naked (luckily from the waist up) with a naked soft-core actress (playing a fifteen year old, but obviously in her twenties). I wonder if they even paid that guy.\n\nThe movie is, on the whole, just more of the same. If you&apos;ve seen one of these report movies, you&apos;ve pretty much seen them all. But if you enjoy them, you may as well check this one out as well.",

      "reviewBody": "I second the opinion of reviewer &quot;Clanciai&quot;, who cites this film&apos;s becoming &quot;constantly more interesting&quot; as it progresses and develops (check the 2nd paragraph of his/her review below). Much of this quality is due to the expert construction of the script,as well as actor/director Irving Pichel&apos;s fine guidance.\n\nSince we immediately learn that the film&apos;s leading lady (and Fred MacMurray&apos;s love interest) has died, the writers must find a way to &quot;pull the viewer into&quot; the events surrounding her death---both before and after. The script accomplishes this superbly.\n\nTake, for example, Fred&apos;s relationship with Olga---they never even kiss! Yet we sense a very real, very powerful emotional bond between them. Fred&apos;s heart-rending sobs at her deathbed further reveal the depth of his love for her. \n\nMany reviewers cite Fred MacMurray&apos;s performance as outstanding; it is. He was truly a fine actor, capable of playing just about any type of role which came his way. I have a new-found appreciation of his stature as a result of this film (where was the Academy, I wonder?)\n\nBut these reviews contain a number of negative comments about Frank Sinatra&apos;s acting; I was actually impressed by his restraint. By 1948, Frank had already demonstrated his acting prowess on screen; clearly, his gentle, low-key performance was his (and Pichel&apos;s) choice for the character, not a result of his inexperience.\n\nMany lovely, memorable moments in this film, especially the recurring motif of the starlit sky (with Leigh Harline&apos;s barely audible, shimmery music in the background), and the wonderful Christmas Eve dinner scene with Philip Ahn---one of the highlights of the film (though I felt it could have used some musical underscoring in the latter half). \n\nBut there are also plenty of dramatic scenes that are beautifully written, acted and directed. I cite TWO of them here: 1.) Olga&apos;s entrance (in full Joan of Arc costume) into Lee J. Cobb&apos;s office as Fred campaigns for her screen test (Lee J. is superb, almost riveting here). 2.) Fred&apos;s spur-of-the-moment, uplifting speech to Frank in the church basement, which dissuades Frank from explaining the &quot;miracle&quot; to his congregation. I had to play each of these scenes back to appreciate their excellence. \n\nHowever, I have one problem with the screenplay (which I suspect didn&apos;t exist in the original story), and here it is: We become increasingly aware that Olga has a very strong attachment to her hometown and the plight of its citizens; her beautiful deathbed speech makes it clear that she wants &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; to serve as a morale-booster for the people of Coal Town, something which will fill them with pride and give their lives new meaning. This is why the &quot;miracle&quot; in the church is so crucial to Fred MacMurray&apos;s mission, which in turn motivates Lee J. to release &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and use the film&apos;s proceeds to invest in the future well-being of Coal Town, since both Olga and her father were victims of the health hazards of its industry.\n\nAll of this is laid out and developed very effectively in the film&apos;s latter scenes. My reservation is the fact that the script is entirely lacking in &quot;setting up&quot; and establishing Olga&apos;s connection with the townspeople of Coal Town prior to her leaving to become an actress, a motive which would clearly explain her commitment to them----a dedication so deep that she would literally give her life to finish her film &quot;mission.&quot;\n\nThe excellent script would have achieved perfection, I believe, if we had understood Olga&apos;s emotional connection to her hometown and seen it demonstrated early on. On the contrary, we see evidence that the townspeople have a low regard for her and her late father, which is confusing.\n\nBut this is fairly minor; I only point it out because the rest of the script is so logical and, as &quot;Clanciai&quot; says, so engrossing as it develops.\n\nAnd no, I disagree with several reviews that claim: 1.) The film is too long 2.) Fred MacMurrays&apos;s addressing Olga as &quot;baby&quot; is off-putting. Both of these were part of our culture and the art of film making back in 1948. Deal with it.\n\nGlad to have made the acquaintance of this terrific film.\n\nLR",

Enter size-shifting robot Jet Jaguar, who enlists the help of Godzilla to battle the two evil Kaiju. Jet Jaguar was the result of a contest Toho held where kids entered their idea for a new superhero and Jet was the winning entry by an elementary age student who was clearly a fan of Ultraman. Considered by many as one of the weakest Godzilla films, this is certainly among the corniest and the most juvenile of the many films, but I&apos;ll admit that I was entertained.",

Isla Fisher&apos;s is back on the screen with an interpretation that matched the one that catapulted her career in Wedding Crashers. A sweet and lovable personality that will overshadow the less likable facets of lies and compulsive buying in which she draws herself. The romance doesn&apos;t steal the show either, flourishing gently on the side and giving the final note of a well executed feel good comedy.\n\nYou could argue the lack of seriousness in which this disorder is being treated but I believe this is not what the movie tries to achieve. Don&apos;t look for an intellectual masterpiece but instead sit down, get comfy and relax cause this is a chick flick that will give you a few laugh-out-loud moments.",

I went to elementary school a very short distance from the courthouse (which was shown a couple of times). \n\nI won&apos;t give away any of the plot... but it is a gripping tale of sharecropper&apos;s family... focusing on the eldest son, in particular. Much of it is difficult to watch, because of the unfairness of the era... but we must remember these things as not to repeat them.\n\nUltimately, I was moved emotionally... and there&apos;s also a fair amount of luscious cinematography to savor... along with some occasional kernels of humor... as well as some very hopeful lessons.",

The only musical number was &quot;Swing Long, Sweet Chariot&quot; near the end of the movie.\n\nThere are some funny scenes in here, but not enough of them. Too much of the film takes place in one room. This is like a play and it begins to drag after an hour. Donald McBride, with his constant gruff voice and shouting, grates on you after awhile, too.\n\nLucille Ball is in here, and I always didn&apos;t recognize her. She looked very young (which she was!). \n\nOverall, the film has entertainment value but, personally, I would rather watch the boys&apos; others films.",

      "reviewBody": "After the success of Babes In Arms for MGM, Arthur Freed became the hottest producer on the lot and was granted his own famous Freed Unit to produce the best of the MGM musicals for the next 20 years almost. According to Hugh Fordin&apos;s book on Arthur Freed the next scheduled property was Good News, but that got shelved for several years when Louis B. Mayer decided that a patriotic type theme was in order and after all MGM had bought the screen rights to the Gershwin musical Strike Up The Band. Freed agreed, but in the Hollywood tradition only the title and the title song were retained for the screen.\n\nThat was enough because the Mickey and Judy formula was by now established with Babes In Arms. Here the two are a pair of talented musical kids and Mickey is the drummer in his high school band. But he&apos;s got other things on his mind besides doing John Philip Sousa. Even Sousa did more than Sousa when he was leading a band. Mickey is filled with the new jive rhythms of the day and he&apos;d like to use the other kids in the school orchestra to form a real band. He&apos;s got Garland in mind for the vocals and the object is to get an audition from Paul Whiteman.\n\nWhiteman in his day may have appropriated for himself the title of King Of Jazz, but certainly no one did more to popularize the new American art form among white audiences. His orchestra was the training ground for many of later big band leaders. Leaders like Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and Glenn Miller all who were sidemen with Whiteman and who kids like Mickey and Judy and the rest of the cast were listening to.\n\nIf Strike Up The Band isn&apos;t exactly let&apos;s put on a show, it still is let&apos;s put on a concert and Mickey and Judy do have some shtick to perform, their Gay Nineties spoof is quite good. Also the fantasy sequence of the &apos;fruit orchestra&apos; doing Our Love Affair is also nicely done, it looks very much like Ray Harryhausen&apos;s claymation figures, but he wasn&apos;t involved with Strike Up The Band.\n\nStrike Up The Band won one Academy Award for sound and was nominated for two others. Roger Edens and Arthur Freed wrote Our Love Affair which was nominated for Best Song, but lost to When You Wish Upon A Star. And Edens and Georgie Stoll were nominated for Best Musical Scoring.\n\nBusby Berkeley directed the film and in the finale shows his fine hand for spectacle. Here&apos;s where the patriotism that Louis B. Mayer was seeking came out. Remember this was 1940 and a lot of people were very afraid the USA was going into another World War. The finale with the title song was the kind of rousing patriotic spectacle that Hollywood would be doing in every studio after December 7, 1941.\n\nWith Strike Up The Band Arthur Freed proved he was no flash in the pan as a producer. After 70 years the film holds up well and the talents of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland reign eternal.",

      "reviewBody": "This may not be the greatest White House movie thriller ever - as its makers claim - but it is probably the most politically explicit. Gone are the days of Advise and Consent, when the opposing parties were simply referred to as the &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;minority&quot;, and the movie aimed at non-partisan neutrality . Here, the administration is Democrat, and the film proudly wears its liberal heart on its sleeve. And the movie is all the better for this clarity and honesty.\n\nJeff Bridges is well cast as Jackson Evans, a President every bit as charismatic and opportunistic as Bill Clinton. Indeed, the whole movie can be seen as a take on the Monica Lewinsky saga, highlighting the manipulation and hypocrisy displayed on all sides at that time. (One mistake in the script is a direct reference to the Clinton impeachment vote; it is dangerous for parodies or satires to refer to the true stories on which they are based - it leads to a dislocation in the audience&apos;s point of view, and in this case to the awkward question - if this is a post-Clinton Democrat President, and he&apos;s coming to the end of his second term, in just what year is the action supposed to be taking place?!)\n\nGiven the White House shenanigans in recent years, it is surprising that some IMDb commenters should question the plausibility of the plot, which I feel stretches our credulity no further than most Hollywood thrillers. Joan Allen as vice-Presidential nominee Laine Hanson, and Gary Oldman as Shelly Runyon, her would-be character assassin, have strong parts and make the most of them - though personally I think it is Bridges&apos; movie - but there is perhaps a little too much of Christian Slater in a curious role as Reginald Webster, a young, liberal, but seemingly anti-feminist, Democrat Congressman. The director, Rod Lurie, seems unable to make up his mind whether Webster should be portrayed as an overly-naive idealist, or an ambitious cynic with his eye on the main chance. \n\nOverall, this is a fast-moving, enjoyable film, making the points that petty personal indiscretions should have little influence when it comes to power politics, and that it&apos;s about time the USA had a woman as President or at least a heart beat away.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience&quot; - quote from Peter Sellers.\n\nPeter Sellers had many quotes like this in which he spoke of his near self-hatred, hated seeing himself, and that when he was not doing comedy, he was dull and unfunny. That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing, because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.\n\nBeing There is a great film. It deals with a simple premise - if you act in a certain way, people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child, and all that he knows in gardening. However, he dresses in nice suits, has impeccable manners and is not shy, so he is accepted into social circles. When he speaks of gardening, his ramblings are mistaken for metaphors and he is instantly considered an economic genius.\n\nThis is wrapped around a beautiful film, in which Chauncey wanders from one circumstance into another, never changing his demeanor, never faltering. I an reminded of Mr Magoo walking blindly down a succession of steel girders thinking they are stairs. Essentially, he is not in peril because he does not know he is in peril. The charm of this film exists in Chauncey&apos;s unwavering personality, and how it affects the world of phonies and bureaucrats he has come to inhabit.\n\nAlthough the film sometimes comes across as forced, and some of the encounters with Eve (Shirley MacLaine) come off forced, the film is still a masterpiece. Its theme and Sellers&apos; stunning performance lauch it into the catoegory of greatness.\n\nThere is much debate amongst the lovers of this film over its final scene. If you have not seen it, rent it, and draw your conclusions. Like many great movies steeped in mood and metaphor, we are left to draw our own conclusions.\n\nThe phrase &quot;I like to watch&quot; has become so famous from this movie - it refers to Chauncey&apos;s love for TV and the fact that it is his reference point for his existance. (Such has when he tries to click a remote to thwart off muggers). But there is a great deal more to Being There. It is a Top 10 Selection of 70s, Hal Ashby&apos;s best film and Peter Sellers greatest performance. **** out of ****.",

      "reviewBody": "This kids SF movie was the second Yugoslav-Czechoslovakian co-production made in the same genre. First, &quot;Gosti iz galaksije&quot; (&quot;Guests from the Galaxy&quot;) seemed to have more ambitions in SF, but it wasn&apos;t clear what audience was it made for. Compared to American, Soviet, French, even Scandinavian SF movies this one was obviously made with lack of money, but also a lack of real SF script, so it sometimes seemed to be a parody, sometimes movie for early teenagers, trying from time to time to look rather serious. &quot;Tajna starog tavana&quot; was more clearly targeted to kids, at the time when filmed probably for age 11-14. And, logically, main characters are the same age.\n\nTimes and tastes change, and it is not easy to believe that any modern 14 year old would keep his eyes on the screen for more than 5 or 10 minutes. Modern kids watch modern action movies, and this one is too slow and hopelessly out of date. No matter what censors might believe, this kids can always find a way to see movies that are restricted in some way (that makes those movies even more attractive and makes kids eager to get them), but even if we check movies that are meant for their age (or at least aren&apos;t forbidden) we&apos;ll see breathtaking dynamic films with more attraction in a single minute than &quot;Tajna...&quot; has during its whole story.\n\nEven American movies that were supposed to be teenagers adventure hits in 80&apos;s and were indeed very successful for that generation (like Goonies, Flight of Navigator, War Games etc) don&apos;t impress 21st century teenagers, who grow up under influence of quick short YouTube clips and dynamic, often aggressive PC games.\n\nAnd there is a problem with the title itself. &quot;The Secret of an Old Attic&quot; is made after a novel written by one of most famous Croatian SF writers Zvonimir Furtinger and his co-writer Mladen Bjazic. It was published under the name &quot;Zagonetni stroj profesora Kruzica&quot; (Mysterious machine of professor Kruzic), but in a decade or two it suddenly changed its name to &quot;Nista bez Bozene&quot; (Nothing without Bozena). And finally we have a movie with new name, and no mentioning of the novel and its author. There is no doubt it is the same story, not only this is the same plot but the character names are the same as well. But neither movie credits nor IMDb (or any other web-site) has ever mentioned the real authors.\n\nUnlike American child stars who are quickly involved into celebrity-star-system European kids very often make one or two movies (parents don&apos;t push them too hard, maybe because of different position of children in society, or simply because there is no big money in European movie industry) and usually don&apos;t try to make adult career. However, there are exceptions, and the kid with smallest role in this movie, Rene Bitorajac, now is a famous actor who played supporting role in successful war comedy &quot;Kako Je Poceo Rat Na Mom Otoku&quot; (*), and later the leading role in Oscar winner &quot;Nicija zemlja&quot; (known as &quot;No Man&apos;s Land&quot;). The adult roles are played by most popular actors, and Yugoslavian (and later Croatian) movies never had problems with bad acting. However, instead of adjusting few decades old novel, the authors even omitted the suspense, reduced SF to (slow and mild) action making this movie look like cheap TV program.\n\nThis is a pity, because Furtinger deserved better, and good actors and great location (island of Hvar is one of Croatian tourist top destinations) in a co-production with respectful Czechoslovakian cinematography offered base for international success. The only destiny this movie can have the way it was made, however, is to become a content of some old attic, without any secret.\n\n(P.S. Why did I give this movie 5 stars? One must have in mind when and where it has been made and not rate according to what would average audience expect from a movie made tomorrow and appeared on web this morning. Considering everything it is not that bad, just wasted compared to what it could have been.)",

      "reviewBody": "In Blood and Wine, Jack Nicholson plays the likable antihero he plays so well. He&apos;s married to Judy Davis, but is having an affair with Jennifer Lopez, and although he seems like a respectable wine merchant on the surface, he&apos;s actually planning to steal a diamond necklace from one of his clients, with the help of his partner Michael Caine. But, since it&apos;s Jack Nicholson, we forgive him.\n\nBlood and Wine isn&apos;t your typical heist movie, because there are more elements to the plot than just the robbery. There are family tensions, a love triangle, and character development, which helps make this a highly enjoyable movie to watch. When you care about the characters, you care about the movie. The performances are very good, and Alison Cross&apos;s and Nick Villiers&apos;s script is pretty riveting.\n\nSo often in films, the actors who play children don&apos;t even think to adopt the mannerisms and inflections of the actors who are playing their parents. In real life, you can see an enormous amount of similarities through the generations, from gait to speech pattern to the frequency and timing of brow raises, to the tiniest of facial expressions. Stephen Dorff, while playing Jack Nicholson&apos;s stepson, took the time to do his homework. When he speaks, it&apos;s clear he grew up in an environment where Jack&apos;s mannerisms were influential. He&apos;s not giving a Jack Nicholson impression, though, and that subtle distinction makes all the difference in the world.",

Why make a movie about someone who suffers senslessly his entire life, and eventualy kills his whole family because of his insanity .. Is it worth seeing? Well I guess you&apos;ll have to figure out the answer for yourself. But even with enough popcorn for 3 hours, one should never waist 2 hours of his precious life."

Another one is finding love ... or what he thinks is love.\n\nThis is an indpendent movie, that will either work for you (slow pace and all) or not at all. The sentiment feels real, the attraction to a mother but also lover figure even more. And they picked the right actress (European project, her German is really good) for that role too. Not an easy movie in many ways, but rewarding for those who stick with it and like these types of movies anyway",

However, the third segment, starring Bruno Ganz, as a driver who picks up a couple, is well worth your time. It is a shame the whole film was not based on these characters and story, but I have to rate the film as a whole, not just a segment of it. Worth viewing for this one piece.\n\nIn that segment Ganz gives a ride to two strangers, and much is revealed during the ride.",

It sill holds up, some 40-plus years later, and I&apos;m still wondering when a DVD will come out. The great cinematography alone makes this cry out for a good DVD transfer.\n\nIt was an apt choice to cast Robert Ryan as the sadistic &quot;Claggart.&quot; Ryan played mostly villains in his career and is extremely effective in that role here as an intelligent-but-sick-and-vicious bully. In fact, his character in Billy Budd remains one of the most memorable villains I&apos;ve seen in a half century of movie watching. It isn&apos;t just his deeds. The looks on his face alone as he delivers his lines make him fascinating. \n\nPeter Ustinov gives a great performance as the captain of the ship and a man who has to make a big, big decision about Mr. Budd, played by a young and boyish-looking Terrence Stamp. The character &quot;Billy Budd&quot; is about as pure and innocent as some of the characters Jennifer Jones played in the 1940s, such as Cluny Brown, Bernadette Soubirous or Jennie Appleton. Also of interest is Melvyn Douglas as the aging seaman.\n\nThis is simply a powerful and very involving film, one that is hard to forget.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie might be a stretch for some but just like you have fairy tales like Snow White and Cinderella, we have Nujum Pak Belalang. The storyline is quite familiar and as quite often, the ending is a happy one but P. Ramlee has lots of other sad-ending movies so bear with this one. Ahmad Nisfu, once again, demonstrates his extreme flexibility in characterising the kind hearted but sometimes distracted Sultan (King). P. Ramlee&apos;s two other constant acting buddies, Aziz Sattar and S.Samsuddin, turn in different roles here as the villains and to fine taste as well, managing some balance between evil and hilarity. Malik Sutan Muda, who stars as the Penghulu (Mayor) doesn&apos;t get substantial supporting roles like these too often but proves how well he can deliver when given the opportunity. This is a perfect movie to get a glimpse of how real kampung life is like as this folklore wasn&apos;t set anytime in the modern era. It&apos;s mostly a comedy but there&apos;s a lesson to be learnt at the end of the movie, just like how most fairy tales have. It may be a little too simplistic but it&apos;s a good movie with good actors, good direction and good storyline."

The ambition of the enterprise clashes with its clarity, its accomplishment even with its honesty. I&apos;ve spent 10 critical years of my childhood in Sicily and the Sicily depicted here, beauty an all, felt like the work of a foreigner. This is a Sicily for exportation or, the Sicily of a dreamer with a very acute cinematic eye. Not the Sicily of Visconti&apos;s &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; to be sure but perhaps Tornatore&apos;s way is a cleverer way to go about it. This is a exemplary crafted &quot;product&quot;. It doesn&apos;t have the depth of real art nor its purity. It has, however, a great show of confidence in itself. Beautiful images, beautiful protagonists, beautiful score. The toothless smiles of the under proletarians the color coordinated attire of the rich, everything in place just the way we imagine. To say that I was disappointed wouldn&apos;t be quite true, in fact, I enjoyed it much more that I thought I would, but now, twenty four hours later, very little of it remains in my mind or in my heart.",

      "reviewBody": "The story of &quot;Godzilla Final Wars&quot; is like &quot;Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and &quot;Matrix&quot; rolled into one. An alien from Planet X comes to earth pretending to warn earth people about the danger of planetoid Golath which will be impacting earth in 11000 hrs. They also remove monsters that are on rampage in several cities around the world. But of course this is all just a show to win favors from the earthlings. They are secretly out to destroy civilization and transform earth people into human cattle. Earth has seen birth of mutants which have special powers. They all have the same &quot;M&quot; gene that people from planet X has. Ozaki (Masahiro Matsuoka) is one of them, and like Neo in Matrix, he&apos;s the only mutant who&apos;s powerful enough to beat the Planet X invasion force leader (Kazuki Kitamura). Earth&apos;s last chance to save itself is the core Earth Defence Force team on Gotengo (Atragon), and Godzilla who&apos;s kept in hibernation. Gotengo goes on a mission to wake Godzilla up and confront all the monsters under the influence of Planet X leader and destroy their mother ship.\n\nOut of all Godzilla movies made in the 21st century, which was on again off again at best, this one in my opinion is the best. Being the 50th anniversary Godzilla movie, this movie doesn&apos;t skimp on nostalgia. The old faces like Akira Takarada (Gojira &apos;54), Kenji Sahara (Rodan), Kumi Mizuno (Matango) shows up to say fare well to the franchise that lasted 50 years. CGI special effects are also more realistic on this movie than say the &apos;90s Mothra franchise.\n\nOn the minor note, music by Keith Emerson is terrible, and acting is as soul less as the actors themselves. Wardrobe is unbelievably bad, and the plot - well, there&apos;s really no plot to speak of.\n\nGodzilla fights the following monsters: &quot;Gigan (1)&quot;, &quot;American Godzilla (Called here Zilla)&quot;, &quot;Kumonga&quot;, &quot;Kamacuras&quot;, &quot;Anguilas&quot;, &quot;Rodan&quot;, &quot;King Caesar&quot;, &quot;Hedorah&quot;, &quot;Ebirah&quot;, &quot;Monster X&quot;, &quot;Gigan (2)&quot; and &quot;King Gidorah&quot;. Mothra and Minilla (Son of Godzilla) makes appearances as well. I had some loathing about Toho&apos;s poor selection of talents, and sometimes cheezy special effects until I heard they make these movies for under $10 million, and I had renewed respect for Japanese efficiency (average Hollywood picture costs $64 million). This movie seems to be made on slightly bigger budget than usual and effects are better. So after some disappointing shows since the death of Heisei Godzilla, this movie recaptures the excitement of Godzilla movies, and in my opinion, this is more like it !",

While Nick Mancuso looks like he had a fun time playing the role of the Marquis, much of the cast could have used acting lessons before filming began. Still, there was not much of a role for Mr. Mancuso to play anyway. The story attempts to build but never gets off the ground. The final scene that it does build to is a complete let down. After 92 minutes I felt cheated. The only thing left for some people to watch is for a few glimpses of bare breasts, usually very brief and in dark rooms. I am just glad this movie is over and I can watch something interesting like paint drying on the wall.",

The movie is entertaining, contains some nudity that might shock some Americans (certainly for a movie from the nineties) but it&apos;s not really a big deal for others. The acting is good and that from the whole cast. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a movie I would want to watch a second time but it&apos;s certainly good enough to watch once, plus it&apos;s always good to learn some Spanish.",

      "reviewBody": "Homer Smith (Sidney Poitier) is a stubborn , obstinate ex-soldier when heading himself to the West he stops at a farm in desert . There meets a group of speaking-German nuns from East European Catholic . They are ruled by a stiff Superior Mother called Mary (Lilia Skala) and she thinks Smith has been sent by Christ for the building their church . They&apos;ll develop a likable friendship , helping the unfortunate nuns and creating a particular divine mission until the touching ending .\n\nIt&apos;s a fascinating , quiet film , perfectly acted and concerning the narration about the construction a church of riveting manner . Gentle , sympathetic Poitier and the strict Superior nun confront wills each other , but finally learn the meaning of the power of God and ultimately come to respect themselves . The storyline by James Poe relies heavily on the continued relationship among them but it isn&apos;t tiring ; being entertained and with numerous diverting moments and agreeable feeling . Enjoyable comedy and laughters are continuous ; the chuckles are based on diverse characters and differences among protagonists , he&apos;s Protestant , nuns are Catholics . Biggest of the film are the musical duets between Poitier and the nuns . The movie is well set with nice rural scenarios and is&apos;t eventually hampered by racist stereotypes on the black men , neither Mexican people . The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and are treated religious and ethic issues with great sense of fairness and ductility . Ideal cast completed with magnificent actors . Sidney Poitier won a well deserved Oscar . He was the second African-American to win an Academy Award , before won Hattie McDaniel and later will achieve it famous actors as Cuba Gooding , Denzel Washington and Halle Berry . Glamorous and sensational cinematography by Ernest Haller . Moving and phenomenal score by the great Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful blues-songs by Poitier . The motion picture was driven with enormous fair play by director Ralph Nelson (Blue soldier) who followed this with a television movie . This is a wholesome and politically correct family fare . Indispensable seeing for Poitier fans.",

Even after death, these girls are denied human rights when their cremation costs 10 times more than normal deaths. Kudos to CNN Hero Anuradha Koirala who continues her battle to rescue girls through her organization Maiti Nepal. And kudos to the rescued girls who continue to advocate this cause and join hands to banish sex slavery and trafficking. And kudos to the men who marry these rescued girls and help them get back a normal life which most of us are blessed with. This film is definitely a passage to the brutal and obscure life of girls who are sold to forced prostitution in exchange of foreign money.",

The problem here is that there is nothing remarkable or note-worthy. Documentaries used to be about compelling subject matter that were supposed to educate the world; but this one comes out as rather un-inspired.\n\nWhile I am a fan of Al Franken, I don&apos;t see why this needed to be made as it gives us nothing new and I&apos;m also not learning anything new with this one.\n\nThere have been better docs and there have been worse docs. To say that it is terrible would be wrong; but it would also be wrong to say this one is highly important and/or necessary. I need to stress how much MORE one will get out of reading Al Franken&apos;s books than a random viewer will get out of watching Al Franken: God Spoke.\n\nOne MUST be a liberal to enjoy this; but even this liberal was un-impressed with this very-standard documentary. PLEASE ... read Franken&apos;s books or you won&apos;t be getting much out of this impressive individual (as this does him no justice).",

The only reason I&apos;m giving this movie more than 1 star is because of the business sense of the filmmakers to put this together and make money off of the Madonna name. Other than that, the film itself, is pretty much about a low-life who becomes lower and lower, up into the very end of the movie. This low-life meets the Madonna character who runs around with a gang of lovers, and basically gets involved in satanic rituals, murder, and whatever else turns them on. Even a couple nude scenes of Madonna doesn&apos;t help this from being a cheap thrown together mess of a movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very enjoyable film for its charm and idyllic musicality with much of the best music of Schubert - the only other music in the film is by Beethoven, who appears in a few scenes with very impressing pathos, like a continuance of the great Beethoven film of 1949 with Ewald Balser, who here completes the picture of the Beethoven tragedy with poignant acuteness. Karlheinz B√∂hm plays Schubert with convincing sympathy and communicates a very truthful image of the young composer&apos;s amiable personality. The story is of a promising love affair that unfortunately reached an unintentional end and is a typical operetta intrigue - &quot;The House of Three Girls&quot; was a successful operetta based entirely on Schubert&apos;s music, but the film goes deeper into characterization and feeling - it&apos;s actually a very sensitive film with music playing the lead exquisitely illustrating the moods of the Schubert circle with their parties - you recognize much of it from the equally heart-warming Mozart film three years earlier with Oskar Werner as the ultimate Mozart. The film focuses on the bright sides of Schubert&apos;s life and omits the rest, which adds to the charm without going superficial - after all, the unequalled melodious music of Schubert is anything but superficial in its perfect musical purity. This is not only a film for lovers of music and Schubert but for anyone who just want to have a moment of delightful company and entertainment in a perfectly harmonious environment.",

She played it with such enthusiasm and in such a sexy way that it would be impossible not to like her, even if one hated the rest of the movie. The depression era setting was perfect for it, and Ms Vargas. The rest of the actors, including the lead male, were just props for her role. Then, during the end credits, a great blues/jazz song was played. I left the credits running just to listen to it and find out who was singing it. It was... Valentina Vargas. It&apos;s amazing to me that she does not have a more extensive resume.",

The more it is surprising,that &quot;XXY&quot; comes from Argentine, a country not especially prominent in modern gender discourses. But Luisa Puenza impresses in her first feature film with a sensibility and open-mindedness,which will last in the memory for a long time.Puberty is always a difficult state between two identities: Not longer a child and not yet an adult.For the main protagonist Alex that problem doubles,because for her there is also the question of her future sexual identity.Society demands a clear decision.Like the language,which cannot find an expression for his/her existence - the adults alternately speak of &quot;her&quot; or &quot;him&quot; -, so the medicine aims at subjecting everyone to its sexual bipolarity. With witty dialogs and panache the film proclaims the right of being different and of searching one&apos;s own sexual niche. But luckily it&apos;s far from being dogmatic or didactic.It also understands the position of the parents to give their child a kind of shelter and save it from the confrontation with society.What the film openly criticizes are the operations, or should I better say amputations shortly after birth. The acting is generally fine, especially by Efron(&quot;Glue&quot;) and Darin.The missing star is the result of little flaws: In some places it too symbolically conceived: It takes place at the coast,which combines land and water; the father working as a marine biologist for sea turtles,whose sex cannot be defined from outside.Such clear hints wouldn&apos;t have been necessary. Luckily in our modern advanced society it is for an individual easier possible to define its own &quot;normality&quot; and fight for it, though it will be a lifelong fight.The film shows that in a way encouraging the viewers.",

A ghastly storyline, none of the characters have any depth - in fact I did not feel a shred of empathy for any of the characters. Kareena Kapoor, who I usually like, spent the entire film with her eyes wide open looking shocked (and was otherwise utterly expressionless). This I blame (as well as everything else) on truly bad directing. They drone on and on about Indian culture and renouncing of the self for the good of others - but none of it seemed genuine. The main characters sleepwalked through the performance, and I do not understand how talented actors like Anil Kapoor could have agreed to &quot;acting&quot; in this. The side characters of Manoj Bajpai and Shamita Shetty only serve to annoy. I am still reeling in horror at the fact that I wasted my time in this utterly pointless manner.

Man with a grudge, Dr. Kurt Leopold, transforms himself into a murderous &quot;man fish&quot; reeking revenge on all who have scorned him and anyone who gets in his way. Sure, the FX are non existent, the acting and dialogue amateurish, and the monster looks incredibly inane - a &quot;man fish&quot; with fur around the neck and back to hide the zipper! But that&apos;s what makes these films loads of fun to watch! You have to admire these independents who often invest their life savings to produce these gems. Lots of heart and soul fuse this genre. Today&apos;s excuses for cinema with bloated corporate budgets, over production, over paid prima donna actors, and excessive FX can&apos;t compare to the spirit and zeal of this genre. Cinamatic hacks such as Spielberg, Scorsese, Lucas, and Coppola who prostitute themselves on a consistent basis can learn a lot from the likes of The Blood Waters of Dr. Z."

Besides, there&apos;s no hint of the nihilism often to be found in the genre later on. \n\nThe leading actor&apos;s character reminded me a bit of Adriano Celentano&apos;s type of character: always a little bored and very very cool, if a bit ridiculous. \n\nAll in all an entertaining nice little nothing, but amusing in a friendly way."

      "name": "La Strada: Fellini&apos;s masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "It is the early sixties in Annapolis, Maryland. Although a Third Class Petty Officer in the Navy, I am still in my teens &amp; have never sampled the cinema except for what Hollywood has had to offer. I have just stumbled out of a theater &amp; I am stunned yet aware that I have just witnessed a work of art that was devoid of compromise. That work was La Strada, a cinematic creation directed by Federico Fellini. I have viewed this film several times since but it never pales &amp; each time I take away something new. In this post I&apos;ll concentrate on the main characters &amp; some of the cast.\n\nAnthony Quinn was perfect for the role of Zampano, the grubby strongman performer touring the villages &amp; countryside of post-WW2 Italy. No other actor of the day could have possibly brought what Quinn brings to the role. There may have been some European actor who would not have shamed himself in the part, but I can&apos;t think of who it might have been &amp; certainly no actor known by Hollywood could have done so well as Quinn. One has to resort to other eras &amp; reach far into the imagination to attempt such speculation. If Wallace or Noah Beery, sr. could have managed a not too corrupted Italian persona; perhaps. If Gilbert Roland had lifted weights &amp; taken supplements for a year; maybe. Victor McLaglen could never have passed for Italian ¬ñ don&apos;t laugh ¬ñ he had the rugged looks &amp; the physique. Ricardo Montalban? Too handsome. Ditto, Victor Mature. Mitchum was way too &apos;American.&apos; Nehemiah Persoff, Eli Wallach, Telly Savalas, Rod Steiger, Karl Malden, even Van Heflin, all considered, all rejected. Brando might have been credible. One remembers &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; &amp; &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; &amp; thinks: Possibly. But Quinn plays the role as if it was what he was put on earth to do.\n\nQuinn&apos;s Zampano is earthily callous yet the viewer senses vulnerability buried deep within the character. Among other facets his perfect performance presents to the viewer is a faintly perceived inkling of past disappointments, of indirectly inferred reasons that Zampano is cruel &amp; insensitive. Quinn&apos;s consummate technique paints the broad picture of a lout yet the viewer is able to pull a slender thread of sympathy from his character &amp; that sympathy is necessary for the end of the movie. To be very bad &amp; to still be likable, if only barely, is produced by Quinn as if it were a gift to the viewer. It is acting on the highest possible plane.\n\nGiulietta Masina plays Gelsomina, a tattered urchin Zampano purchases from her poverty-bested mother. Here too, the viewer witnesses genius of casting. Masina&apos;s face is one of Fellini&apos;s main canvases in the film. It mugs, it displays pride, love &amp; resignation in fleeting cascades of expression, sometimes all within a second. Even without the plasticity of her face her body alone would be enough to write volumes for the viewer. It gambols, prances, pratfalls &amp; cunningly sneaks, sometimes at breakneck speed though the viewer&apos;s eye is never allowed to blur these perceptions despite the rapidity of much of the execution.\n\nRichard Basehart plays the Fool, foil to Quinn&apos;s brute. Whereas Quinn&apos;s act subsists on feats of strength, Basehart&apos;s character is all about finesse: juggling, acrobatics &amp; tightrope-walking. Zampano is awkward on those occasions that he attempts real affection toward Gelsomina. The Fool is light strokes of joviality; joking &amp; flirting is his natural mode. Zampano&apos;s voice is gruff and in the baritone range; Basehart&apos;s lines are delivered high-pitched, with a lilting modulation. However, just as Zampano has an almost hidden vein of sensitivity, Basehart imbues his lighthearted portrayal with a close to imperceptible strand of hardness.\n\nThe vehicle of the plot is a journey, but a journey with no particular physical destination. In a work such as &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; Twain provides a direction(down-river with the current). Here the characters appear to wander aimlessly from place to place, seemingly interacting by chance with whoever they meet &amp; somehow this very lack of goal helps to give the piece a lifelike aura of randomness. The viewer becomes unaware of watching a film. Like all truly great works of art, technique never intrudes &amp; the viewer could be a fly on the wall.\n\nThis lack of artificiality allows the viewer to be fully immersed in the unfolding events. The landscape is the blasted Italian environment just after WW2 &amp; is symbolic of the work&apos;s bleak message. The camera rolls on weeds, shacks, broken concrete, poorly maintained roadways, dry, desolate hinterlands &amp; famine-ridden villages. There is no looking away allowed, the viewer is made to see, forced to behold stark realities.\n\nIt is impossible to say exactly what makes this film a masterpiece. By a mysterious &amp; perhaps lucky combination of ingredients it propels itself into the highest circle of cinema. The end is emotionally wrenching &amp; I would venture that few are able to leave it as I did long ago in Annapolis without a sense of having been deeply moved."

      "reviewBody": "Not so much a horror as horrific. With youthful properties gained from apparently eating dumplings containing special stuff, I won&apos;t give away the twist that happens in the films opening sequence, this is a visceral ride through this sordid Hong Kong tale. With cinematography by Christopher Doyle who did last life in the universe and 2046, it looks amazing, the crazy colours and dazzling visuals are offset by disturbing ideas and gross out scenes. What follows is a story of the length people will go to in pursuit of vanity. Well acted, well paced and always unnerving you are never sure where the film is going to go from the start to the madness of the final chop ending. Fans of the twisted and people used to the bizarreness of Asian extreme films will really be swept along in the story and all the disgusting close-ups that add to the horror. Adding also is the crispy clear sound that has such attention to detail that the slightest noise even one as banal as a clock suddenly takes on an eerie feel. Overall a brilliantly played out film but one for those with a strong stomach.",

      "description": "Mei is a trashy, former abortion doctor who shuttles back and forth across the HK-China border with benign-looking containers of glistening dumplings. Bound not for the family dinner table, these dumplings are of a special sort, and the preferred meal of a high-paying clientele who seek their famed youth-renewing powers. Qing is a nearing-40 former soap actress clinging to her youth and attempting to win back her philandering husband, who sucks down chicken fetuses in an attempt to maintain his own vigor. Regular meals at Mei&apos;s apartment only whet her appetite for eternally smooth skin, and trigger an ominous search for an even more potent variety of the dumplings&apos; secret ingredient. \n\nThe ingredient in question, while appalling, is only a warm-up to the twisted moral and cosmic consequences that result from the ethical-boundary-free rules that govern their universe. In his best film to date, Chan masterfully holds a mirror up to the increasingly frightening world around us, and pushes all the right buttons.",

      "reviewBody": "Someone is killing people in health spas and gyms(42, apparently... and no, I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a relation to the meaning of life... however, apparently, no one wants to shut down these businesses until they catch, you know, one of the most prolific murderers), namely, the very attractive people(and I&apos;m sure the so-called nerds from their high schools are now authoring fan letters to him). We get to see one such massacre, and it&apos;s apparently so overpowering for the editor that he has an epileptic fit for the duration of the sequence. Thankfully, we do get to see two women fully naked in this first scene, though this unfortunately is not a trend... only one other hot chick in this shows skin, and that&apos;s pretty early on, too. Once that&apos;s over, you may as well stop watching. The characters are flat. Acting is lousy(did you expect otherwise from Roberts(as one of the cops trying to get the &quot;person&quot; doing the bloodletting, along with Phil YoMotha) and Vosloo?(who&apos;s also going after him/it... and ruining the economy by using worthless bills)). John Rhys-Davies is given nothing to do other than embarrass himself... it&apos;s like he lost a bet or something. The comic relief is poor, we get several awkward sex jokes, and at times, you can barely tell if something is meant to be a punchline or not. Dialog is bad. There&apos;s not much gore or violence. The &quot;action&quot; is meh, so are the FX. This has an extremely repetitive chase. The flick is like a lame Predator knockoff, with the &quot;creature&quot; looking exactly like a human(yes, we get to see a different &quot;face&quot; for him, for little other reason than to have it, and note that it isn&apos;t the one on the cover... I think that&apos;s Batboy, actually) and using cloaking tech less(and sometimes really just to avoid showing something), with one brief Evil Dead 2 bit(and *no*, it is not worth it to rent this for that... Raimi&apos;s is far funnier). It&apos;s only 82 minutes long sans credits! I guess in its own weird way, it has its heart in the right place. The obvious message of caring about animals and thinking highly of them is rammed down our throats for the last half hour. If this wasn&apos;t so unknown, maybe that would have gotten a reaction. Probably about as positive as the one Avatar got, with morons killing themselves and getting depressed, utterly missing the point that there is beauty in *our* nature, and we forget that because we understand it. Anyway, this just isn&apos;t that entertaining. I recommend this only to those who love B-movies. 1/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;El Dorado&quot; is generally linked to the cinematographic movement of the French impressionists, a branch of the more famous pictorial current. But L&apos;Herbier&apos;s masterpiece is not to be confined in this label. Actually, the label itself is the only flaw I perceived in the movie: the special effects boasting the power and possibilities of cinema, while innovative, sure, seem somewhat out of place sometimes and lessen the impact of a few frames, yet still improving others. What should really emerge from this film, though, is the poetic power L&apos;Herbier is able to infuse into an average melodramatic plot: every scene has a peculiar delicacy and taste for style uncommon at the time and today. A big merit to the success of the process has to be granted to the lead star, Eve Francis, an incredibly powerful and intense actress who clouds entirely the other performances, that are still above the average of the time (which is not much). It felt strange for me to feel something real about a character in a &apos;20s movie, the only other one being &quot;The Painted Lady&quot;, which is from the &apos;10s, and that is a clear signal for me of the exceptional nature of this masterpiece of the early age of cinema. It breaks my heart that, not having been released worldwide at the time, &quot;El Dorado&quot; has become famous only in France, because it should be known as a true gem both in artistry and in innovation by any film scholar and lover all around the globe.",

      "reviewBody": "Zulu is the true story of the battle of Rourke&apos;s Drift between the British and Zulu nations in 1879. Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke&apos;s Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.\n\nThe nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as &quot;the scum of the earth&quot; - rogues, ne&apos;er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese &quot;Fuzzy-Wuzzies&quot; as well as Napoleon&apos;s invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling&apos;s poems (especially &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;) or read George Orwell&apos;s long essay on Kipling or &quot;The Lion And The Unicorn&quot;.\n\nThis film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering &quot;what are we doing here?&quot;. The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."

      "reviewBody": "Someone should do a book on the making of this one. It might represent the best blindsiding of the Nazi regime by artists who had scores to settle. I&apos;m always amazed and grateful it made it past the censor. First, the writer, Erich Kastner, was blacklisted, a Jew, and had his books burned by the Nazis. But they were SO desperate for a good writer they got him on board for this. You sense they wanted world distribution....even down to the product placement shot of a Munchausen children&apos;s book Albers is holding before the flashback. Hans Albers, the Brad Pitt of his day, was forced to give up his Jewish girlfriend, Hansi Berg, and work for the Nazis. He sent her money in London all through WWII. She made it out in &apos;38 escaping with her Dad. Dad (Eugen Berg) was not as lucky. He got caught and sent to the camps. He died there in &apos;44. Kastner&apos;s script pokes fun of ALL authority, and embraces life itself, and urges the viewer to wake up and take it all in before it&apos;s too late; the Baron turns down power to enjoy life, and always has time for a good meal or a hot date. The photography is excellent, the KINO restoration the one to get..Carnival in Venice is wonderful to see and you find bits of humor and wit and set decoration that survived to the 80&apos;s version..but there is a haunting, melancholy air to this version, even when everyone is enjoying themselves...the writer knows too quickly everything can just GO and you&apos;re best to enjoy what you can while you can. I sometimes see a sad, long look in Hans Albers eyes...is he wondering if he would ever see his gal again? Does he KNOW where her Dad is? What does he THINK of the Nazis?? As it was, Kastner lived to 1974, the richest of the lot, when Disney made his two most famous books (Parent Trap, Emil and the Detectives) into movies. He is the only cast member who&apos;s name is associated with a Lindsay Lohan movie. Hansi came back to Hans and they lived together until Albers&apos; death in 1960. She died in 1975.",

As in a number of movies, the main character - a cop - tries to do everything the right way, but ends up on everyone&apos;s bad side, meaning that he has to go to extreme measures. It obviously looks more questionable in the era of awareness of cops randomly shooting people. If you just take the movie at face value without interpreting it as any sort of advice, then it&apos;s a pretty enjoyable romp. We get some fine shots of the Italian countryside. No masterpiece but pretty fun.",

Although the film bases its story on the true life accounts of the last emperor of China, Last Emperor shows that life can deal one undesirable circumstances and the way one reacts and handles these circumstances determine one&apos;s place in history.  Bertolucci&apos;s powerful method of storytelling also further enhances the greatness of Last Emperor.   The motif of pursuing a forbidden love that remains out of reach presents a tearful message.  Who cannot get misty eyed seeing an eight year old Pu-Yi chasing after his beloved nanny or an almost exact similar scene when a much older Pu-Yi chases his  insane first wife?  Last Emperor will move even the most adamant viewer.  &quot;To his majesty, the emperor... Ten thousand years!&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "This was Rin-Tin-Tin&apos;s last film and i believe that he was about 13 years old at the time. He is not an expressive dog actor like Higgins (&quot;Benji&quot;) or Skippy (Asta in &quot;The Thin Man&quot;) and yet there is something rather grand about him, even in old age, with a grizzled grey muzzle that no one bothered to dye, the way they would have had he been a human actor. In one of the early scenes, a cowboy bystander calls him &quot;Old Timer,&quot; with no attempt to hide his age, and indeed there is a kind of elegiac quality to his work, like the latter day James Garner, whom he much resembles, in a spiritual sense. Rinty is a superlative schutzhund (trained attack dog) and many of his best scenes feature him jumping and wrestling humans to the ground or running after horses at the gallop. At least one (and maybe two) younger, darker-pelted stunt doubles are used for some of the long running scenes, but Rinty takes all the close-ups. He always did suffer from &quot;trainer eye&quot; (looking for cues from his off-camera trainer), but not being food-motivated, he never blew a scene by nuzzling for his hidden treat the way Skippy did. I actually teared up a little at seeing the old guy put through the rigour of being trapped in a mine shaft when the door gets blown off by dynamite. The human actors were expecting the loud pyrotechnics, but Rinty was not, and he was obviously on a &quot;hard stay,&quot; so when the blast went off, he jumped and turned in place, torn between fear and the &quot;stay&quot; command. He looked terrified, and i think he was actually tied down with an off-camera leash to restrain him from bolting. Sweetly, his essential good nature and willingness to please asserts itself at the conclusion of every fight scene, when, after apparently half-killing his human sparring partner, he is called off by Frankie Darro or George Brent, then breaks character to stand around with a big smile on his face, wag-wag-wagging his tail: &quot;Was i good? Did i do that right? Am i a good dog?&quot; What a trooper!\n\nYakima Canutt is the unspoken 2nd star of this feature, of course. He plays a minor character but also supplies the remuda and doubles for almost every actor in the film who does a horse transfer, bucking bronc stunt, or -- Yak&apos;s specialty -- the stagecoach stunt. This film presents a variation on the latter with an open buckboard and six horses instead of the usual four. Strangely, the rear pair are white, the only time i&apos;ve seen Yak use white horses in this stunt; the front four are his usual browns. In addition to the stage coach team, the horse i call &quot;Yak&apos;s Big White&quot; (the stunt double for Gene Autry&apos;s Champion), a cute fat brown pony for Frankie Darro to use in a flying mount, a half dozen randomly great cow ponies, and a trained bucking bronc, there are four or five fine Indian Paint ponies, including &quot;the one with a white neck and brown head.&quot; (If you watch Yak&apos;s stunts, you&apos;ll know which horse i mean -- he was in many dozens of movies, and Yak always made sure he turned his right side to the camera (his &quot;good side&quot; -- very beautifully marked) during Indian attack scenes.\n\nFrankie Darro was a fine kid actor. Like other reviewers, i also love his young adult films co-starring with Mantan Moreland -- but here we see him in top gymnastic form, carrying a reasonable amount of his own weight in stunt work. His greatest drawback at this age is a certain staginess in close-ups, but since the film is a Western, we don&apos;t see much of that &quot;mush.&quot; I really dug the scene of Frankie making a getaway on a chubby brown pony -- the scene is played straight, and Frankie is in top form, but i laughed to see the pony scramble to keep up with the larger horses.\n\nGeorgia Hale, the romantic interest, deserves a quick mention too -- her split-skirt culotte riding garb, with matching vest and silk bandanna, is extremely cute. Both she and Theordore Lorch, who plays her father, carry the baggage of silent film mannerisms, but she is an appealing and spunky actress and looks more than right in the part of the Sheriff&apos;s adopted daughter.\n\nThe Alpha Video print has better sound than other versions, but there are a number of annoyingly chopped up bits, including some mangled chapter endings, dropped words, and overly-dark scenes -- which, as far as i know, are found in every version currently on the market. Still, i&apos;m glad i saw this film, and i recommend it without reservation to anyone who likes animal actors and stunt work.",

Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It is thrilling Science Fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-)  ).\n\nI would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...\n\nSo thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.",

San Clemente is a psychiatric hospital that is isolated on a small island off the coast of Venice. I would like to say that this is the Italian/French version of Titicut Follies, but Depardon&apos;s camera is far more intrusive. Not only are his actions more intrusive, but the subjects (the patients doctors and family members) acknowledge the camera&apos;s presence, often conversing with it and or performing for it. Near the end of the film, one woman even swings a bag at the cameraman, in an attempt to strike him. I&apos;m pretty sure the dialogue of this is in Italian as it takes place in a Venetian hospital, despite IMDb saying it is in French. Though it would probably make the film far more interesting knowing what people are saying, I quite enjoyed this from a mere observational standpoint. As always Depardon&apos;s cinematography is spectacular. His work is always a treat for the eyes, and San Clemente is no different.\n\nnote* English subtitles are now available for this film..YAY!",

Both examine the profound differences and similarities that exist between passion and love, but this film goes deeper, looking at the glory that ensues when, at length, love and passion bloom together.\n\nMuch credit goes to William Daniels, who was D.P. for directors from Stroheim to Ichikawa to Bud Yorkin. His framing and silvery lighting give even greater weight to the superb performances by Garbo and the masterful Herbert Marshall. Together Daniels and director Boleslawski allow the two actors to deliver the very affecting and very adult dialog with rare dignity and feeling.\n\nThe two kitchen scenes in particular, one in the first sequence, and one near the end, are flawless, and all the better because of being parallels, and because the dialog employs the sheer force of elemental simplicity. In the second scene,when cholera-fighting Marshall finally speaks of his wife&apos;s infidelity, he humbly takes some of the blame, saying, &quot;I went blind¬Ö a little mad. But if all the men who were hurt simply quit ‚Äî bad business.&quot; Garbo at last begins to understand and replies, &quot;Being in love, and letting it smash things as I have, I thought it had the right of way, I really did.&quot; She finally realizes that passion, such as hers for her lover, can be both deeply felt and utterly shallow.\n\nOne more note about the visual genius on display. A standard clich√©, fireworks,is used to suggest orgasm, but it is done as brilliantly and thrillingly as I&apos;ve ever seen: three or four bursts of sparks shoot into the frame, like nothing so much as ejaculation.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;THE STAR&apos;: Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nA computer-animated Christian family film, about the story of the Nativity of Jesus, told through the eyes of a donkey and other animals. It was directed by Timothy Reckart, and it was written by Carlos Kotkin and Simon Moore (based on an original idea by Tom Sheridan). The film features the voice talents of Steven Yeun, Keegan-Michael Key, Aidy Bryant, Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Tracy Morgan, Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Christopher Plummer, Ving Rhames, Gabriel Iglesias, Anthony Anderson, Kelly Clarkson, Patricia Heaton, Kristin Chenoweth, Kris Kristofferson, Mariah Carrey and Delilah. It&apos;s received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and it&apos;s also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be a little too kid friendly, in sometimes a pretty silly way, but religious families will probably enjoy it. \n\nThe story revolves around a donkey, named Bo (Yeun), who&apos;s tired of his life of slavery, milling wheat for his owner, and dreams of joining a traveling caravan. His father (Kristofferson) helps him escape, and he ends up at the home of Mary (Rodriguez), and Joseph (Levi), who let him stay at their home, despite him not wanting to stay there. Mary, being pregnant with Jesus, and Joseph, later leave their home for Bethlehem. Bo, and his dove friend Dave (Key), try to escape, but they end up on an adventure, with other animals, to protect Mary and Joseph instead. The birth of Jesus, and the first Christmas, becomes the result of their efforts of course. \n\nI saw the film with my parents, who are Catholic, and they both liked it. I can see why other Christians, especially those with kids, would enjoy it too. For me the storytelling, and filmmaking, are a bit too basic and routine though. There&apos;s also an excessive amount of silly kids humor in it (but kids should like it at least), and I didn&apos;t really care for the animation either. I did like that it&apos;s all told from animals&apos; points of view though, and there&apos;s even some animal rights/vegan messages in there (that I really appreciated). I think the film accomplishes what it set out to do, and it should please it&apos;s target audience at least."

      "reviewBody": "One of the usual ways Weimar cinema is written about is as a product of a country devastated by war, inflation and, ultimately, Nazis, but there are surely worthy research topics for the effects of the 1918 Influenza pandemic on the film industry. Not only Germany, either--there seems a surprising dearth of film scholarship (and, perhaps, historical writing in general, but I know less about that) in regards to that misnomer &quot;Spanish flu.&quot; Most film books I&apos;ve read on the time period don&apos;t even mention it (recently double checking the indexes of some of my library, I found nothing), and those that do tend only to mention theatre closings. Historian Richard Koszarski, for one, corrects in an article for &quot;Film History&quot; his own error of omission in his addition on the era to the otherwise thorough &quot;History of the American Cinema&quot; series. A thread has emerged on the subject at Nitrateville, a website of message boards devoted to silent and classic cinema. Anyways, I bring this up because &quot;The Plague in Florence,&quot; while about a past epidemic, was made during a time of another plague, and, of course, in 2020, I&apos;m reviewing it as still another pandemic rages. I doubt this is a coincidence.\n\nA striking conflation in the film, I suspect, is found in the dead. In recently learning more about the Influenza pandemic, it seems unusual in how it largely killed young, otherwise healthy people and also for how symptoms reportedly would strike them suddenly. Just about the only contemporary film I&apos;ve seen on the subject, a public-information picture, &quot;Dr. Wise on Influenza&quot; (1919), indeed, depicts a young man abruptly collapsing in public from the flu. &quot;The Plague in Florence&quot; nominally concerns the Black Death, the plague. The bodies in the streets and even the vision of rivers of bodies here may be attributed to this historic bacterial disease. The most commonly attributed symptom of plague, however, are the buboes (hence, &quot;bubonic&quot; plague), the inflamed lymph nodes scarring bodies. That isn&apos;t seen here; characters are simply infected and collapse. They tend to be young and otherwise healthy, too. We don&apos;t see the so-called Council of Elders succumb in such a way.\n\nAlso interesting is how the plague infects the political dynamics in the picture. In the film, there&apos;s a, let&apos;s say, war between the lovers of orgies and repressive fanatics, some of the latter of who are quite rapacious themselves. The free-love republicans come to power, but then the Pestilence comes to upend this political, religious and sexual situation. Sounds of its time in the tumultuous Weimar Republic for a costume drama, or Kost√ºmfilme, as the revisionist German film history books in my collection dismiss it. Such past historical interpretations seem as though they&apos;ll be challenged, though, if they haven&apos;t yet been, especially in light of the current pandemic. Silent-film enthusiast Fritzi Kramer, of the Movies Silently website, has already written a good review of &quot;The Plague in Florence.&quot; For the U.S., Koszarski and others have mentioned how cinema closures likely aided Adolph Zukor&apos;s plans to vertically integrate Paramount--leading to the system that would dominate Hollywood for decades. (Likewise, today, we&apos;ve at least seen a hastening of the upsurge of streaming and the market share of China&apos;s theatrical market.)\n\nAs historically interesting as all of this is--following a thread through three pandemics--until I&apos;m able to see a nice print and restoration of a 1919 silent film by way of Blu-ray on a large TV screen in my own home, none of this is to say that &quot;The Plague in Florence&quot; isn&apos;t a flawed and, even for its day, dated picture. The reason it&apos;s available at all, in a collection of his silent works from Kino, is that Fritz Lang, early in his career, is credited as scenarist. Directing was Otto Rippert, otherwise seemingly only known for another rather obscure, but conceptually-intriguing silent film, &quot;Homunculus,&quot; a Frankenstein-esque serial from 1916. Part of the problem is that Lang&apos;s scenario is meandering. The Black Death doesn&apos;t arrive until an hour and 20 minutes in, and, then, more than a loose resemblance to Edgar Allen Poe&apos;s &quot;The Masque of the Red Death,&quot; it largely serves as obscene evangelizing; or, as a couple title card puts it, &quot;The stones begin to speak. And nature revolts against the lovemaking that is abhorrent to nature.&quot; The scenario also seems to shift the protagonist between three characters in a lackluster love triangle, one an unfortunate siren trope of a woman who&apos;s blamed for the lust of the men who chase after her, one a dandy dressed in the usual flamboyant fashion one imagines of a Florentine man of the Medieval and Renaissance times and the other a grave monk prostrating himself beside a crucifixion idol before constructing his own cross.\n\nThe so-called orgies, too, that the monk at first laments, are hardly more than kissing-and-hugging parties of lounging about to music. Had Germany not imported the Babylon sequences from D.W. Griffith&apos;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) by then or what? I wasn&apos;t expecting &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), but even by 1910s standards, these supposed orgies are tame. This is some of the worst timing I&apos;ve seen of party planning, too: in one scene, the woman is saved from being almost raped and so decides it&apos;s a good time for a festival and, later, as soon as the plague enters, they decide to throw a masquerade ball! Rather undermines the city&apos;s closed-wall quarantine, one would think.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t help, either, that the acting is dated in the stilted fashion before the likes of, say, Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford or, across the Atlantic, Asta Nielsen and Pola Negri offered more naturalistic or, at least, cinematically, as opposed to theatrically, intended performances. There are a lot of broad gestures--raising of arms and whatnot--in this one. To be fair, such acting does correspond to an often distant camera, and, in that respect, there is some admittedly fine work done in deep stagings, including interiors divided into up to three planes to accentuate the extreme depth of field and crowded long views of enormous sets. Yet, these tableau stagings seem dated by 1919, when classical continuity cinema had already emerged, including in Germany as Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; (1919) will attest. Overall, the crosscutting and scene dissection--particularly for interiors--is relatively scant here. Maurice Tourneur was already editing conversations into over-the-shoulder shot/reverse shots in &quot;Victory&quot; (1919); meanwhile, the camera sits in the same place here for entire or almost entire scenes and returns to the same seat for scenes in the same locations, such as that pathetic fight scene where one guy appears to faint from flexing his own muscles as the other guy merely holds his shoulders and arms.\n\nNevertheless, and even though the moralizing of the picture is self-defeating, the notion itself of lovers battling the Church is amusing. The vision scene of the &quot;place of lost souls,&quot; including that river of corpses, a dragon and other weird stuff, is a highlight, and it reminds me of a Georges M√©li√®s f√©erie, where a fairy godmother type--replaced here, then, by the monk--would often guide the hero with such fantastic spectacle of stage and trick effects. Earlier, there&apos;s a torture scene. Ultimately, it&apos;s the plague that interests most here, though, especially in 1919 amid another pandemic... especially now in 2020.",

The &quot;theme&quot; - a beginner witch is trying her first spells ‚Äì has nothing to do with the real witchcraft, because it&apos;s a mere narrative handle to build funny, hilarious, ironic situations. A very successful handle indeed, because the plot runs riot with very entertaining scenes. What makes this film so funny is its not taking itself seriously and its joking without malice on persons and themes. The school teachers turned into rabbits and locked into a hutch, the pupils who suddenly get donkey ears and their she-teacher walrus teeth, the boy who &quot;looses&quot; his head and tries to replace it with a clay head of Napoleon.... these are just some of the situations of this movie. I kept on laughing almost the whole film through. Special effects are simple, but not at all childish and unsuccessful. After all, with good ideas, modern technologies and heaps of money are not necessary for making a good movie. The Czechs were great in the fairy tale genre, and had at least one precious quality which the other Eastern Europe countries did not have: the absence of political propaganda. The Russians or the Germans of GDR couldn&apos;t refrain from putting it in almost every movie. And the political propaganda spoils the magic and the lightness of a fairy tale. In this one you will find none. Somebody says that it is an ancestor of the Harry Potter saga. Nothing of the kind! The child wizard takes himself tremendously seriously, and pushes the poor children of the real world to emulation. This is just an innocently funny movie, where spells are almost laughed at, because they are only a way to.... laugh.",

These films are often funny, and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. This film fits this model perfectly. It is a Mexican monster movie, riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. The makeup is not that bad, and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this film is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script isn&apos;t half as slick (Aliens vs Predator might get a 1 from me, but I want to see it again before I commit).\n\nThe plot is ridiculous, but deliciously convoluted. If you&apos;ve read this far, you must really want to know... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters. Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad, and quite perverse. This mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from Wizard of Oz, but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same &apos;scientist&apos; whose wife just so happens to have been an Aztec princess in a past life (don&apos;t ask), is pitted against the robot for the big &quot;climax&quot; the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs.\n\nFor what its worth, given the budget and the utter silliness of the script, this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie. If you&apos;re into that sort of thing, go for it.",

      "reviewBody": "SWEET AND SAVAGE represents Climati and Morra&apos;s final attempt at Mondo cinema.  Having been seriously stung by previous criticisms of their film-making and of the genre itself in the past, it&apos;s surprising to see that once again they happily exhibit scene after scene of almost unwatchable nastiness.\n\nSWEET AND SAVAGE contains a large bulk of out-takes and reused footage from Climati and Morra&apos;s previous mid-70s Mondo efforts, and predictably follows the same format.  Accompanied by a pretentiously epic sound-track, the beauty and the savageness of nature are juxtaposed in a vain attempt to justify the violence on display.  However, the more pleasant scenes just come across as twee and make the disturbing footage even more distasteful. As usual, scenes of animal slaughter make up the majority of the movie, but there are also a few faked and unfaked sequences involving humans. Tightrope walkers and stunt-men fall to their deaths; a corpse of a Tibetan monk is hacked up and eaten by vultures atop a mountain (surprisingly, this footage looks genuine); and in the &quot;stand out&quot; scene, a man is tied to two trucks and has his arm torn away.  The final scene is clearly fake but that didn&apos;t stop it (as well as much of the other footage in this movie) turning up in Damon Fox&apos;s appalling TRACES OF DEATH series...\n\nFor me, the aspect of the Mondo genre that is so fascinating yet also indefensible is the misrepresentation and misinformation that these supposed &quot;documentaries&quot; push on the viewer.  SWEET AND SAVAGE is no exception. For instance, many of the scenes have been clearly over-dubbed using actors voices in hilariously un-PC ways.  In one scene, Africans are shown snapping the necks of ostriches, but these men have been over-dubbed with ebonics-laden, deep South accents.  I can&apos;t help but laugh at such moments, but it is one of the aspects of these movies that is the most distasteful.\n\nSo all in all, this is the close of a fascinating and controversial chapter in Italian exploitation cinema.  Saying that, I doubt it is for everyone."

The story is great.  A misanthropic rabbi comes to a congregation in San Francisco and get waylaid and falls into (mis)adventures with a seedy character.  This unlikely duo make their way to SF undergoing a number of adventures. If you do not understand the yiddishekeit of this film, go take a look at the Marx brothers.  The scene where battered Wilder sees the Amish and goes screaming in Yiddish only to discover the cross in the bible in one of the farmer&apos;s pockets and faints dead away, is worth the price of admission along.  The voting scene at the Yeshiva where only the little boy votes for Wilder invoking the older Rabbi turning his eyes to heaven and saying, &quot;It&apos;s going to be close!&quot; is likewise great. This is zany Yiddish theater at its best.  Wilder, always overacting, is SUPERB as the rabbi.  Ford is merely great as the kindhearted outlaw.  The bad guys are bad, the characters they meet along the way, Schiavelli and veteran character actor Ian Wolfe are great as the Trappist monks, even Joe Kapp is great as the Mexican RR worker.  This is great watching and one of my favorite films.  Don&apos;t knock it.  It&apos;s hilarious.  Check it out!",

Paul Verhoeven has been trying to make a film like this for years, but in my opinion has never got close.\n\nMutante is pure Science Fiction (and I mean SF *not* Sci-Fi) - deadly anti-bourgeois social commentary wrapped in a delicious coating of blood, sugar and intergalactic terrorism.\n\nNice one!",

But it doesn&apos;t matter, because Peter Weir is a master storyteller.  The actors are all superb and your heart may hurt at the climax - mine did.\n\nUnforgettable, like all great movies.",

However, you wouldn&apos;t know it from seeing this movie. I usually love spaghetti westerns, even the lesser ones, but this one took a great effort for me to sit through. For starters, there is far less action than you might think. Most of the movie is devoted to the characters engaged in (boring) chat. The actors seem to be trying, but the unbelievably actionless plot leaves them pretty much helpless and unable to do much. And while Richard Harrison is prominently billed, for some reason he is put on the backburner for the most part while the less famous actors are given more to do. The filmmakers chose some good locations, and occasionally you get a taste of what a GREAT western adaptation could have been like. But otherwise, this movie will be a great waste of your time."

In this film the characters grow and recognize things about themselves. The humor is still very much there and the actors do a great job with their characters. There is also some really cool cinematography and animation in the film that was an unexpected bonus. The scenery was really amazing it made me want to go to New Zealand!

      "reviewBody": "Despite his advancing age, Glenn Ford made a number of westerns during this period, this one being one of his weakest. It does have an eccentric cast, most notably George Hamilton, who doesn&apos;t fit at well here. It&apos;s not that he can&apos;t act, but his look and demeanor come off a bit too &quot;nice&quot; for a character who should be meaner and grittier. Oddly, he has much more screen time than Ford, though maybe that&apos;s for the best since Ford seems a bit bored and uninterested in the little we see of him. It&apos;s not like the script is inspired or anything, giving us weak characters, unfunny comic relief (despite some brutality shown or implied several times), and even offensive racial stereotypes. Not to mention an underwhelming ending that at the same time feels unfinished. The production quality is also surprisingly cheap and sloppy at times, not just with some incredibly bad editing, but with obvious post-production shots and sequences shot in a studio instead of outdoors on location. Probably wasn&apos;t the inspiration for the movie &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; made several years later, but who knows."

Sandra Bullock is an actress who falls into the latter category.  Yet, in this category, she is at the top of the tree and it is in films such as Miss Congeniality that she proves this.\n\nFor a fish out of water comedy, this is a film that plays to Bullock&apos;s qualities - her tomboy image from Speed, her warm humour and her ability to play for laughs and be deadpan.  As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt.  However, if I had one criticism, it would be that there are occasions when Caine just appears to be shamelessly mugging and camping it up for the camera to no real effect.\n\nThere are some genuinely funny moments, mostly centred around the pageant and it is nice to see such a movie which doesn&apos;t take itself or its setting too seriously.  Many of the contestants give good supporting performances and as such, it is hard to pick one out.\n\nOverall, it is a bit slight but anyone renting/buying this movie would surely know what to expect - familiar, funny and essentially sweet-natured - just like Sandra Bullock herself.\n\n8/10 - A good example of the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "Not many discuss Bertolucci&apos;s La Luna as one of his most challenging films but I beg to differ. In 1979 I presume the film&apos;s campy allure had not been registered but today it&apos;s all to be seen; call it kitsch or ironic, but la Luna encapsulates two worlds Bertolucci tried to negotiate in most of his films - the world of appearances and surfaces against the inner world of the protagonist. La Luna plays both against each other as a masquerade, because what we think we are getting is not what we really are seeing. Bertolucci presents the first part as a post-Freudian fable in late 70s Rome where an Opera singer and her son indulge in an Oedipal relationship. Bertolucci then introduces the lost but real father to the scene as if to eradicate Freudian psychoanalysis as a spurious retelling of Greek myth. It seems the son only wants his father&apos;s recognition and love, while the mother is marginalized. It&apos;s a very masculine thesis for Bertolucci, one that reinforces the illusory fundamentals of Patriarchy, while negating the matriarchal as a mere bypass to the final journey(father&apos;s love).\n\nJill Clayburgh&apos;s acting is off-key most of the time but this unwittingly invests the film with its latter-day camp quality, while Matthew Barry looks dazed and confused throughout the entire film. Rome is undoubtedly the best part of the film as well as the sumptuous visuals that capture its sun-drenched beauty and decaying but grand monuments.",

There aren&apos;t many surprises here either, but the acting makes it believeable anyway. It&apos;s too much to say that this is like a documentary, it&apos;s far from it, but the realistic performances by Ariane Ascaride and Jean-Pierre Darroussin give real life to everything.\n\nMarseilles plays a big part here. That city is almost like an actor. The emotional conditions for these people might have been different somewhere else. The tempo is slow however and so is the temper. You have time to breath, watching this.",

This is one of those popcorn and coke matinee films which i saw a zillion times when it ran on WGN and WKBD in syndication. The film features well known actors. In another version i thought I read CHRISTOPHER LEE says his lines. There may have been another version. STARSHIP INVASIONS came out as a &quot;b&quot; movie yet garnered a cult following on tv. It also was one of those post star wars films that capitalized off ufo myths tied in with ancient astronaughts like HANGAR 18. All of this makes for a fun story and has been fodder for years for writers searching for fiction story material. With some revamping the film could have been better. I sense budgetary constraints. As a boy I liked it and loved the escapism. Fans of older science fiction will enjoy this piece for a fun afternoon or evening. Fans of LARENCE OF ARABIA don&apos;t expect DAVID LEAN quality here. Expect escapism."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;RABBIT HOLE&apos;: Four Stars (Out of Five) \n\nDavid Lindsay-Abaire adapts his tragic play about a couple who lose their young son in a car accident. The film is directed by actor turned director Cameron Mitchell (who also directed &apos;SHORTBUS&apos; and &apos;HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH&apos;, in which he also played the title character). It stars Golden Globe nominee Nicole Kidman (who also produced the film) and Aaron Eckhart (who&apos;s equally impressive). The film is full of tough hard to watch drama and strikes a very realistic and believable tone. Depressing but worth the watch.\n\nThe film focuses on how each spouse copes differently with their tragedy. Becca (Kidman) wants to get rid of everything that reminds her of her son, including the dog he chased into the street the day he was struck by a car. Howie (Eckhart) wants to hold on to all the things that bring him cherished memories of his son, including videos he constantly watches and the dog (which he brings back into the home after getting into a heated argument with his wife over it). The couple&apos;s marriage nearly falls apart as each looks for comfort in different ways. Becca finds peace in an odd relationship with the teenage driver (Miles Teller) who struck their son and Howie finds happiness with others outside the home as well including a mutual friend of he and Becca&apos;s (Sandra Oh) they know from a counseling group. Dianne Wiest plays Becca&apos;s mother who also lost a son but, as Becca points out, an adult son to drugs.\n\nThe film has some dark comedic moments to lift the tension but for the most part it&apos;s a pretty hard hitting drama. The acting is all outstanding, especially the two leads, and the film is smartly written as well as nicely directed. Some might be afraid to watch it because of it&apos;s dark depressing subject matter but it does manage to find a little small ray of hope in the darkness. Of course there&apos;s no happy endings here but it has some nice commentary to deliver on life and coping with tragedy.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzh1FLmMq4",

Well, Lon was nowhere to be found and this flick is not part of his filmography.  However, John&apos;s head was in it, so that&apos;s no lie!  The box art was also exciting-looking as it proclaimed the flick was titled &quot;Horrors of the Red Planet.&quot;   Well, its really &quot;Wizard of Mars,&quot; but I would have called it &quot;The Insomnia Cure of the Red Planet.&quot;   &quot;Wizard&quot; resembles a large budget student film of wannabe filmmakers who must have been using this production for practice and who may (or likely did not) go on to better things.   An amateurish looking drywall &quot;spaceship,&quot; Death Valley-style desertscape, Carlsbad caverns, and what looks like a warehouse set the scene.  Our  band of high school play dropout explorers land on Mars and discover an ancient civilization replete with aliens housed in tubes (that have mud packs for makeup) and eventually the alien disembodied &quot;Wizard&quot; image of a John Carradine (desperate for work).   The Wizard&apos;s &quot;city,&quot; as depicted in miniature, looks like an aquarium castle, with a sun shining over it as if with a flashlight shot through a bedsheet in a darkened room. I could go on for several paragraphs with descriptions about the almost scene by scene mistakes of logic, science, bad acting/script/staging, etc...ad nauseum.   Perhaps thats why I find this film so fascinating...it has so many mistakes, its an adventure to find them.  Only the atmospheric photography in a few scenes and the sci-fi-weird music was really of note."

I had nightmares for weeks, and my mother was very angry at my cousins for taking me to see it.  I wasn&apos;t allowed to watch a horror flick again until I was old enough to go on my own and buy my own ticket (and even then I stayed away for a while. . . the next one I saw was Nightmare on Elm Street when I was in highschool!!!).\n\nAnyway, I saw the movie for the second time two nights ago, 29 years later.. .  and it was not as scary as I remembered.  However, I can see how my young mind was terrified at the time.  AND, I can see how my teenaged cousins loved it so much.  In 1972, this movie was at the early end of the blaxploitation era, and besides the fact that the main character was a bloodsucker, the characters were generally positive (i.e. no pimpin&apos; drug-dealin&apos; gangstas)  You&apos;ll be hard pressed to find another early seventies black movie that can say that!\n\nI think, for the time, it was a pretty good low budget horror movie.  They deserve their own category, you know."

      "reviewBody": "CODE 7, VICTIM 5 is now available in a cheap DVD, and for a few dollars (mine cost $3 US), it&apos;s passable entertainment, mostly for the presence of Lex Barker as private eye &quot;Steve Martin&quot; (same name as Raymond Burr&apos;s character in GODZILLA). This is a typical Harry Alan Towers production--find an out-of-the-way country where the pound/dollar goes a long way and without powerful unions, hire a lot of locals in small roles, use a lot of free locations to give the film &quot;color,&quot; have Towers himself pen a by-the-numbers script over dinner or during a flight. South Africa photographs well (the film was shot by Nicholas Roeg, so it&apos;s no surprise), and is so unfamiliar to this American that the background almost becomes a character. The plot is the standard &quot;someone is killing off one by one the members of a group from a previous time&quot; and ex-Nazis are even dragged in. Ronald Fraser (best known in the USA for FATHOM, with Raquel Welch and the late great Tony Franciosa) does a good job as the local police inspector who finds jet-setting detective Barker to be a bit of a pest, but eventually realizes Barker&apos;s honesty and professionalism--Fraser and Barker are the perfect foils for each other. Nothing special here--probably of interest mostly to the Barker fan (or those who want a quick three-dollar travelogue of South Africa).",

Although there was more cold blooded murder in this one, the high camp of &quot;Reform School girls&quot; took much of the edge from this one.\n\nSybil Danning and Tamara Dobson do great jobs as the leaders of their respective gangs and try to act this one up, but the rest of the cast does not seem to be taking their jobs all that seriously.  This film may have one of the best prison riots ever filmed though.\n\nIf you cant get &quot;Reform School Girls&quot;, but you can get this one, definitely give it a look!",

I finally ordered online a copy of this movie, and because this movie seemed to be something I heard about only in rumors, I had very high expectations. However, I expected a life-changing movie, and I didn&apos;t feel this movie was one of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, the movie is about an amateur magician, who has a talent for figuring out tricks from just one sighting, who uses her tricks to convince a superstitious village that she is the Goddess. However, where this movie really gets interesting is when there are already other magicians trying to deceive the village, which throws the main character into direct competition with the others to determine who is the true God or Goddess. Just as the title says, this movie is loaded with tricks. It is a lot of fun playing along with the movie in trying to figure out how these different magicians do their tricks, and each trick exposed is more clever than the last. However, the movie falls short in story telling. Because this was based on a ten-episode Japanese TV drama, the movie tries to compress a lot of information into a short time frame, so having not seen the drama, the movie feels crammed and hard to follow.\n\nNonetheless, I feel this movie is fun and enjoyable overall, but it did not at all meet my extremely high expectations. Despite the uneven pacing of the story, I was thoroughly satisfied with the cleverness of each of the tricks in this movie and feel the movie is worth watching at least once.",

The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero&apos;s work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don&apos;t get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It&apos;s like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they&apos;ve been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I&apos;ve seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better.",

It doesn&apos;t matter that it isn&apos;t high satire or even reasonably solid on a technical level because when it comes down to it, some guy sat down one day and decided to make a movie that combined two of the average drunk male&apos;s favorite things- zombies and strippers, and &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot; doesn&apos;t just contain zombies and stripping (actual stripping included, by the way), it goes as far as fulfilling its title and providing a horde of surprisingly sexy... you guessed it, zombie strippers.\n\nCommenting on the quality of the direction or the quality of the script with a movie like this just isn&apos;t worth it. This movie isn&apos;t the worst ever made (that&apos;s a fact, sorry), but it is a pretty terrible movie anyway. Could this movie have actually been funny for its jokes? I don&apos;t know. Could this ever have been a quality project in the first place? \n\n&quot;Zombie Strippers&quot; is a movie about zombie strippers. By nature it is going to be pretty darn stupid and pretty darn bad. Using this criteria, &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot; is nowhere near as awful as it could have been. I even chuckled a couple of times. The girls all look good too, Jameson being the least attractive, and to think she was the object of every North American man&apos;s desire in the 90&apos;s (don&apos;t go near plastic surgery, girls). This movie does exactly what it says on the tin, and that deserves some level of respect. Oh, the audacity.\n\n3/10 as a movie, but I can&apos;t say it wasn&apos;t fun on some level."

Nothing special about acting, nothing special about special-effects, nice but not overwhelming 3D-effects, pretty straight forward story-line. I still gave 7 out of of 10 points. Let me explain: Why not less? The movie thrilled me from time to time. That was exactly what i was expecting and what I wanted to see. No hardcore slasher, just a thrilling story of 4 teenagers in the forest. Why not more? In my opinion, neither acting, special effects, storyline or 3D-effects were that extraordinary that I would want to watch the movie again and again and again. I do not want to say that all of this was bad, please beware... It just didn&apos;t overwhelm me. But there is indeed one point that I really want to criticize badly. Before watching this movie I have never heard anything in my life about &quot;geocaching&quot;. Didn&apos;t know that this exists. In my opinion the background of &quot;geocaching&quot; was not explained sufficiently at the beginning of that movie (only if you had watched the specials at the DVD or BluRay.

      "reviewBody": "I thought City Of Angels was very good. I&apos;m usually very critical towards movies, but City Of Angels got to me. Meg Ryan usually plays in Romantic Comedy&apos;s (Sleepless in seatle, You&apos;ve got mail) but this time, City Of Angels, admittedly a Romantic film, but it isn&apos;t a comedy. Far from it, it&apos;s a drama in all of its aspects. And Meg Ryan converts to that change very well. She acts great in this movie. It wasn&apos;t an easy part for her, there is a lot of crying involved, and a lot of dramatic moments in her characters life.\n\nAs goes for Nicolas Cage&apos;s character. Oh my god, he plays Seth with such excellence. Really, i don&apos;t think that anyone else could play the part as great as he did. The way he looks, the way he moves .. so cool.\n\nOk the storyline is a little unbeleivable, but you musn&apos;t be held back by that fact. Just beleive the unbeleivable. Just go with the plot, and follow the movie closely.\n\nI&apos;m not suggesting that City Of Angels is the best in it&apos;s sort. It won&apos;t win any oscars, but what i am saying, is that it&apos;s a nice movie, with great actors, great music and a good storyline which rolls towards very emotional ending.\n\nYou won&apos;t be dissapointed."

      "reviewBody": "One of Hollywood&apos;s greater contract directors, Donald Siegel, brought Hemmingway&apos;s short story to TV, but NBC turned it down because, for 1964, it was too damn brutal. Although it pales in comparison to the 1946 original, this cheap (thanks to the gawd-awful production values of Universal in the sixties) remake holds it own.\n\nWhen button-men Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager show up at a school for the blind to empty their silenced revolvers into former race-car driver John Cassavetes, they don&apos;t expect him to just stand there and take it. Marvin, exuding clean-smelling and lean menace and Gulager, a carrot-juice swilling sociopath travel cross-country in their search for Cassavetes&apos; story. They find that the race driver, washed up after a near-fatal crash gains employment with mobster Ronald Reagan (I can just see Ronnie giving Gorbachev the same look at the 1986 summit that he gives Cassavetes when the driver challenges the mobster for control of Reagan&apos;s girl, Angie Dickinson). After lots of double-crosses and a fair amount of &quot;why did he or she do that?,&quot; Marvin comes calling at Reagan&apos;s door.\n\nLee Marvin was excellent when portraying a killing machine and he holds the movie together. He and Gulager are there to punctuate the sometimes good and sometimes not-so-good flashbacks and they are suave and eerily debonair grim reapers. If anything, they&apos;re more interesting than the flashbacks; all good action flicks need good bad guys and Reagan looks too bored with the whole thing. Is it possible that, after seeing him so successful and upbeat for eight years in the White House, a grim and petty Reagan seems anachronistic? Yet, it really is Marvin who makes this movie rise above the cheap production values, the cheesy matte photography, and the canned John(ny) Williams score.\n\nMarvin was about to begin a string of successes that would last into the early seventies. That voice is so distinctive! When he talked, he sounded, as another reviewer once said, &quot;like a dinosaur growling.&quot; He is so evil and you can&apos;t stop liking him. Although Marvin and Robert DeNiro are completely different actors, they both have the same effect on me when they inhabit the screen--I stop doing everything else and just watch them. Pure charisma. When asked by David Letterman why he was so popular, Lee Marvin simply grinned and, with his index finger extended, growled, &quot;Ratatatat!&quot; Don Siegel would go on to make other tough movies; his style was clean, tough, and with just enough style to leave the audience with a satisfied taste in it&apos;s mouth. Under his direction, Clint Eastwood would establish himself as a superstar. One can only imagine how far Marvin would have gotten under the command of the button-man director!"

      "reviewBody": "Okay, now the eagerly anticipated Madhuri Dixit musical is finally out, I too would like to say a few things about this film. Not that I hated the film completely, but some parts of it really got me into pondering ¬ñ why don&apos;t they just let us give a break and give something really sensible, something you would want to talk about for the next eight months. Not like okay you watch this film, enjoy, come out of the theatre and completely forget about it. Yashraj films who was bragging early this year about &quot;2007-the year to be&quot; has left some silly movies down the lane and their latest installment &quot;Aaja Nachle&quot; happens to follow the great legacy of Dhoom2, Tara Rum Pum, Jhoom Barabar.. and Laaga Chunari Mein¬Ö Indeed, the theory of quality being inversely proportional to quantity greatly applies here. Aaja Nachle, is, sadly a disappointment. But you have Madhuri making a comeback after so many years, a &quot;perfect&quot; production house that thinks it&apos;ll never get it wrong, a fine craftsman like Anil Mehta ¬ñ wait, I must tell you he&apos;s got the cameraman Mohanan to shoot the scenes beautifully, but himself as a director ¬ñ a big no no.\n\nAaja Nachle is simply a bunch of faults and flaws. Starting right from the first sequence, we get into thinking &quot;Why don&apos;t they leave the Americans alone?&quot; It seems Yashraj does not need actors but American extras and even at rarest occasions when you don&apos;t need them, they&apos;ll always have space to squeeze in a few. Then the music teacher gets some horrendous costumes to wear, records his farewell video (God, tell them 2007 minus 11 is 1996 and technology, fashion and everything else was already far more advanced then than shown!) and passes out. Then Dia gets into this quest to get the city together, and does some old school jhataks. (Okay, those expensive sets can be considered as &quot;cinematic liberty&quot; to quote critic Taran Adarsh but someone please tell me when did she get the theatre renovated and get all extra dancers when no one in the town was willing to cooperate?) Anything that&apos;s good is of course cinematography, sets and costumes. (Remember the good qualities of Om Shanti Om were almost exactly the same things.) Konkana and Kunal Kapoor doing some nice job there but the one to steal the show is of course the supporting cast. (What did you think I&apos;d say Madhuri Dixit? No!) Madhuri&apos;s come back does not impress me. Sincerely, she&apos;s still the same old Madhuri and lot of water has flown since she left. Our tastes have changed and we are used to watching other actresses doing far more natural acting than she does in the movie. Irfan Khan is invisible in his short role. Akshaye Khanna&apos;s character does not convince me. I love the supporting cast which always happens to be the strongest factor in a Jaideep Sahani screenplay ¬ñ be it Khosla ka Ghosla or Chak De India. I&apos;d really look forward to Jaideep Sahni writing another supporting cast-driven movie than Anil Mehta be allowed to direct again. Music is so-so. The only songs to have impress me are &quot;Show me your Jalwa&quot; and &quot;Dance with me.&quot; Technically, there are several plot holes and consistencies but you&apos;d bypass a lot of them considering it be mere &quot;cinematic liberty,&quot; but no former superstar can save your show when your screenplay is leaking and got holes all over it. The scene where Nazma confesses to Dia could have been far better and thrilling if Divya Dutta would have been written to enter the scene with a bang. The conclusion is predictable but Jaideep has forgotten to close some plots he opened. What happened to the other lady who was replaced by Nazma? What about the deal between Chaudury sahib and Irfan Khan&apos;s character? And why does not Dia teach her daughter to speak Hindi when she is so much in love with her cultures and traditions? Some bad screen writing done there but the rest of the movie makes up for those blunders.\n\nThis movie would not get repeat audiences. At least I&apos;m not going to watch it again. Not even in DVD. It does not get high scores from me. Well 6/10 should do fine. That&apos;s all I&apos;d accommodate for a good visual treat.",

      "reviewBody": "Did really Himmler only want measures of skulls, legs, hands, colors of eyes, descriptions of Shapis and Blue Tibetan Sheep, and so on? Did he really want to discover traces of the origins of the Aryan race in Tibet? In Tibet of all places? I will never believe it. He simply wanted to establish an alliance with that strange country and its ruler (the Dalai Lama&apos;s Government) to try and create a connection with the Japanese armies which were at that time ravaging China, and close British India in a mortal pincer. The Nazis Sch√§fer and Beger knew it perfectly well. That was their real mission. Nevertheless this documentary remains of extraordinary interest. Probably the first account of Tibet on film. Needs English subtitles, which is possible to find on the Web.",

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same to our Malaysian film, &quot;Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam 2&quot; (PHSM2). In fact, this film is so awful that I simply regret watching it.\n\nNothing seems to work for this film. The pontianak (vampire) looks like a Chinese Opera singer. The way she flies is so artificial, nothing like the vampire in &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;. In fact, the pontianak will also be shown climbing tree in the film. One question, why the pontianak needs to climb the tree when she can just fly ? The background music does not suit the film. The performance of the actors are slow and boring.\n\nNot recommended !",
