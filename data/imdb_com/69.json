I enjoyed the music as well. I would see this film again with a friend.",

      "reviewBody": "Kill the Irishman tells the story of Danny Greene and his rise from rags to riches through the mob and their many attempts at killing him. Being of Irish decent, the aspect of this one Irish guy who kept getting on the Italian mob&apos;s nerves, it peaked my interest. \n\nThe film has a great story to tell and I can only imagine how amazing the film would have been if they had a director like Martin Scorsese behind the camera. That&apos;s what I kept feeling while I watched this film, that it was a Scorsese wannabe. That&apos;s not exactly a bad thing, because I did enjoy the film, but I wanted to enjoy it so much more. \n\nThere are aspects of the film that are great and if a masterful craftsman were behind the camera than I can honestly see this film being one of the best of the year. The film feels short on a lot of things, mainly the small things that would have made this film great. The relationship between him and his wife was nonexistent. The smaller characters played by Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer and Vinnie Jones deserved more screen time. There was a relationship between Stevenson and Kilmer that was interesting, as one was a cop and the other a known mobster, but the film decided not to dive any further than two scenes. I hate to throw Goodfellas into the mix, but had the story been crafted more like that film, then this could have been great. \n\nThe story is based on true events, with some liberties of course. Some of the special effects, like the car bombings are incredibly poor. A story like this deserves a bit more attention to detail from the writer and director. It felt like they loved the story, but didn&apos;t know exactly how to tell it. Again, if they had proper backing in the budget department, then this film would have been really great. The car bombing scenes are really poorly done and this is such an integral part of the film. Some of them are actual explosions, others aren&apos;t. It&apos;s poor production values, stick with the real thing. \n\nKill the Irishman is a good movie when it should be a great movie. In terms of gangster flicks, it&apos;s one of the better ones. It&apos;s nowhere near the calibre of Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco. It feels like the odd film that wants to be apart of the family. It just falls short of admittance. A good film is good film though.",

      "reviewBody": "RGV did it again!! Rakht Charitra can be easily mentioned as one of the best of RGV, or even one of the best in the history of &apos;Dark Cinema&apos;. The direction is top notch, the dialogues are hard-hitting, and the performances are extremely natural and great. Rakht Charitra has all those elements in the right place, to make it a classic. The movie is flawless, fast-paced, and freakingly violent! Yes, the weak-hearted better stay away from this flick!! Rakht Charitra is about an era, where it was believed that &apos;Revenge is the purest emotion&apos;, rather than &apos;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind&apos;. It is about Pratap Ravi, one with a strong heart. After he loses his father and brother in the dirty game of Politics, he decides to take revenge, and the real Rakht Charitra begins. There is a lot of tears in the movie, tears of downtrodden mothers and wives, tears of abused and exploited sisters, but there is even more blood in the movie, which takes the revenge to all the tears shed. But, do not expect a mindless movie with blood only, it has a strong storyline, without which, the movie would have been a forgettable offering from RGV. But this has the story, and is executed extremely well, and it has turned out to be a must watch for people who watch movies with true spirit.\n\nVivek Oberoi is in his top-form, he does the role of the lead protagonist Pratap Ravi with ease, he is excellent in his role. Look at his eyes, the way he looks, gazes and stares, you will realize it!! And Abhimanyu Singh, he is damn great!! Excellent acting, it is fact that villains in RGV flicks will be notorious, but this guy is great, he is excellent in his role. Sushant Singh was awesome in his scenes, I had a strong sensation of clapping loudly, while watching him walk in slow motion. Shatrughan Sinha is good, Zarina Wahab, Radhika Apte, Ashwini Kalsekar, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Rajendra Gupta, Anupam Shyam all were good. Sudeep and Darshan Jariwala, I guess is reserved for the 2nd &apos;Adhyay&apos; of Rakht charitra.\n\nI really want to point out some scenes that prove the director&apos;s excellence, but it may lead to spoilers, so I&apos;m not going to do it now. The only negative I could find is RGV&apos;s voice, which lacked high power. However, all I can say is watch the movie, you won&apos;t be disappointed. The movie has got the power, it is not just a movie, it is Epic!!!",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s important to note there are TWO versions of this film. Jacques Perrin&apos;s original runs 104 minutes and is narrated by Perrin in French. Disney bought the film, cut 20 minutes (much of it critical of human activity endangering the oceans and animal habitats), junked Perrin&apos;s spare narration, which lets you wonder at the sights on view, and substituted a gabby but emotionally chilly commentary by Pierce Brosnan.\n\nPerrin&apos;s original version is not available in the US, per contract with Disney. The original is available in Europe on DVD and Blu-Ray (but unplayable on most US machines) but it seems to lack English subtitles. So you&apos;re pretty much stuck with Disney edition.\n\nThe original, however, is to my mind better and much more in line with Perrin&apos;s &quot;Winged Migration&quot; than the Disney version. The best that can be said for the US edition is that plays down the &quot;humanizing&quot; of animal life that was an annoy hallmark of Disney&apos;s True-Life Adventures of the 1950s."

      "reviewBody": "The Goodbye Girl is a well-paced and bright romantic comedy from the 1970&apos;s which also reflects the lifestyle and social currents of that decade, sandwiched between 60&apos;s idealism and 80&apos;s materialism. This might sound glib but for me, it fits neatly in that period when young people were coping with disappointments and heartache as they tried to build lives for themselves. The script and the acting are funny, sad and entertaining throughout.\n\nThe repartee between Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss sparkles as the two people who are forced to accept each other as roommates, only because of economic necessity. One is a granola-eating guy from Chicago who meditates and exercises as he tries to make it in the New York theatre scene. The young woman is a single mother who has been abandoned by her common-law husband and tries to return to dancing. The music of Bread evokes the soft rock of the decade. We see Marsha Mason working as a sales girl for a Japanese car company in an era before Japanese cars were commonplace. Before gay rights became part of the social agenda, Richard Dreyfuss takes on the role of Richard II in a way that a 1970&apos;s audience felt was more like their home decorator or hairdresser. It all seems a bit dated and predictable; however, with the acting of Mason and Dreyfus and the brilliant script from Neil Simon, it still entertains and resonates with audiences. Herbert Ross directed the movie."

      "reviewBody": "The mid-1910s were a crucial time in the development of cinema. However due to the war that was going on German cinema was to some extent growing up in isolation, and was learning to do things its own way. Besides, in Germany they took their inspiration so much more from their own stage traditions, as we see in this Ernst Lubitsch three-reeler, a good old-fashioned farce loosely adapted from Johann Strauss II operetta Die Fledermaus.\n\nLubitsch however was anything but theatrical in his execution. The director seems fascinated by the possibilities that cinema offers in the field of depth, with lots of long hallways and characters entering from the back of the set rather than emerging from the wings. And it is often this use of depth which facilitates the comedy, such as Harry Liedtke&apos;s drunken lurch home, or his sudden appearance below the desk as the camera pulls back. Lubitsch even extends this trajectory out through the fourth wall, with Liedtke bemoaning his troubles directly to the audience. Characters addressing the audience was not really a done thing in American cinema. Nor was crossing the line of action, which Lubitsch does on one occasion, flipping the camera back and forth to see both sides of a car for a series of gags.\n\nAnother big difference between this and Hollywood comedy of the time is that Lubitsch has no big comedy star. Whereas funny business in the states was being lead and driven by stand-alone comics like Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle, for Das Fidele Gefangnis it&apos;s the ensemble that matters. The comedy acting here generally boils down to wildly running around and pulling silly faces, from Harry Liedtke&apos;s put-upon, forlorn look to Emil Janning&apos;s crazy eyes and wriggly moustache. Not the most sophisticated stuff but it works in the context. None of these players could have carried off a show on their own, but they don&apos;t really need to for this sort of comedy.\n\nDas Fidele Gefangnis is in fact such a jolly, witty, absurd creation that you wouldn&apos;t think there was a war on. When you see such bizarre humour as Agda Nielson having a cigar shoved in her mouth by a hurried guest, or a cheating card-player&apos;s bottom thrust towards the camera with an Ace of Hearts stuck to it, it&apos;s hard to think of the mass slaughter that was going on not so far away at the time. And then again, perhaps it does make sense, since Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s crazed brand of humour makes for wonderful escapism.",

Through following what happens, and through interviews we get to know what drives both the porn star and Vanessa. More interestingly we get to see how easily the get contact with youngsters willing to participate, showing a sexualized world with little shyness. We watch them pick up hurls, and take them back home for a film shooting, which will be sold to the porn industry abroad.\n\nThis us not a film for those who wants to believe in a world without dangers and bad influences. Interesting and close, and a glimpse into an unknown world right in your back yard.\n\nThe film is very raw documentary in style, but that adds to the realism of the storytelling. The film maker shows the most controversial scenes in so shirt clips that you don&apos;t get to see much of the porn action, but still there&apos;s plenty to be annoyed with if you are faint if heart. We get to see many sides of the industry&apos;s bad sides.\n\nA young girls dream of becoming a porn star isn&apos;t something that would promote this kind of behavior, and Vanessa also tells she regrets the secrecy towards her family and friends. She also warns about jumping into this industry.",

Saigan&apos;s characters has certain pity to them that makes you want to cry, but characters in this movie are just acting out the role.\n\nNostalgia is artificial too. It wasn&apos;t quite like that back then. The only character that I liked was Tomoe. Hiroko Yakushimaru puts good punctuation to a rather bland story.\n\nEntrance exam to Tokyo University, hardship of a poor writer, young people coming out to Tokyo to work.

      "reviewBody": "A SHIP COMES IN (Pathe, 1928), directed by William K. Howard, is a sentimental tale of an immigrant family in their newfound land of America. Reminiscent to John Ford&apos;s directorial style, though not on a larger scale, A SHIP COMES IN makes up for its lack of top-named actors (by today&apos;s standards) with well-constructed story, compliments by Julien Josephson.\n\nThe story unfolds in New York harbor where a ship comes in: &quot;Immigrants - hopeful strangers with eyes uplifted toward a vision of homes and happiness - Immigrants.&quot; Of the thousands of immigrants coming off the boat, heading for medical inspection before starting their new life on American soil, the main focus turns towards a Hungarian family from Veshala: Peter Placzmik (Rudolph Schildkraut); his wife, &quot;Mama&quot; (Louise Dresser); and their three children, Eric (Milton Holmes); Marthe (Linda Landi) and Katinka (enacted by Virginia Davis as the child and Evelyn Mills as the adult). After acquiring a place to live, in an apartment building five flights up, Peter befriends neighbor, Dan Casey (Lucien Littlefield), who arranges employment for him working as janitor in the federal building, and Sokol (Fritz Feld), a radical who so dislikes the land of opportunity. While brooming the hallway, Peter witnesses Judge Gresham (Robert Edeson) swearing in immigrants as full-fledged citizens of their &quot;adopted country,&quot; an honor he will have in five years. After Peter&apos;s swearing in as U.S. citizen by his now friend, Judge Gresham, situations begin to occur for the Plecznik family, especially for &quot;Mama&quot; witnessing her 18-year-old son, Eric, becoming a man by enlisting as an Army soldier during the outbreak of the World War, and the arrest and conviction of her husband, a true patriot for his adopted country, for supposedly placing an explosive bomb inside his own cake box intended for Gresham, causing him serious injury and death to his secretary.\n\nRegardless of the plot carried solely by Rudolph Schildkraut&apos;s (1862-1930)fine performance, it&apos;s Louise Dresser (1878-1965), in a role categorized as secondary, who was singled out by the academy voters as nominee for Best Actress of the year (1927-28), competing with Janet Gaynor for SUNRISE, SEVENTH HEAVEN and STREET ANGEL (Fox Films, 1927-28 respectively) and Gloria Swanson as SADIE THOMPSON (United Artists, 1928). Dresser, losing her statuette to Gaynor, did provide this melodrama with key scenes worth nothing, mainly that her reaction as her son goes off to war, and suffering moments as her husband gets hauled off to prison after being found &quot;guilty&quot; for a crime for which he is innocent. As for Rudolph Schildkraut (short man with round face), he&apos;s most noted as the father of stage and screen actor, Joseph Schildkraut (tall with John Barrymore profile), than for his brief Hollywood film roles of the late 1920s. Also listed in the cast is Louis Natheaux appearing as Gregor.\n\nAs with most silent films released during its final years (1928-29) before its conversion to sound, then known as &quot;talkies,&quot; A SHIP COMES IN is virtually forgotten, even by film historians. Whether the movie has ever been televised or not is uncertain, but is it certain that it was formerly available on home video around the 1990s by a distribution company called Grapevine Video. Along with the former Blackhawk Video of the 1980s and 90s, Grapevine, in its heyday, was the home to its large selection of famous and obscure silent movies such as this one. While the Grapevine label lists A SHIP COMES IN at 94 minutes, the existing print, equipped with fair organ scoring, runs 70 minutes, long enough for a good story and short enough to hold interest.

Also, the 1974 TV version with Frank Langella, Ricardo Montalban &amp; Anne Archer, the first Zorro version I ever saw, uses the same theme soundtrack, and the script and dialogue are very similar to the 1940 version.

I was hoping this was before Hooper&apos;s downward spiral of Night Terrors, The Mangler, and Crocodile, but I think this is the film that started that spiral. I&apos;m still finding it hard to believe it was as bad as it was. Tobe Hooper directing, Brad Dourif starring...that&apos;s horror royalty right there. I found Dourif to be disappointing in this one as well. That was hard to type because he&apos;s so good in everything else he does (if you want to challenge that statement check out One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest). I think he should have just said no to this role. I was expecting a very dark film with a brooding anti-hero. What I got was a comical bore, and you can bet that&apos;s not on purpose. You reach a point in the film where you ask yourself &quot;What in the f*ck is going on?&quot; And the ending is pathetic at best. Not even a fiery John Landis cameo nor a radio voice-over by Buck Flower could save this one. Go watch Firestarter instead."

It gets you right into the action and introduces you to a list of interesting personalities, who mesh together nicely and who are also matched well with the cast members.  Beyond that, it&apos;s also effective as a character study involving greed, trust and distrust, and conflicting ethics.  \n\nSam Spade is an ideal role for Bogart, giving him plenty to work with and some very good dialogue as well.  Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are very entertaining, providing suitable foils for Bogart, and they really take the film up a notch.  The rest of the cast also works well (worth mentioning is Elisha Cook, Jr., whose character doesn&apos;t do a lot, but who provides Bogart with some very amusing moments at his expense).  The story is nicely adapted from the novel, and each scene is constructed well, with everything moving along nicely from start to finish.\n\nIf you are a fan of either film noir or mysteries, make this a must-see. There are very few films that work as well as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;."

Helen, as the cabaret dancer Lola, provides more oomph factor. Madan Puri plays his usual desi Chinese villain which he had mastered from the &apos;60s. Incidentally, this movie was launched in the late &apos;60s too but got a delayed 1975 release. That explains it!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

K. Chesterton character, Guinness playss Father Brown as somewhat dotty, the owner of a St. Augustine cross which is traveling to a religious convention. However, there are fears that the great criminal Flambeau (Finch) will try to steal it.\n\nBrown wraps up several packages to bring along so no one will know which is the cross. Alas, the cross is stolen by Flambeau, whom Brown spots although he is in disguise. He decides that he wants the cross back but that he also wants to save Flambeau&apos;s soul and encourage him to return everything he&apos;s stolen.\n\nHe enlists the help of lovely Joan Greenwood to put a beautiful chess set for auction, hoping to entice Flambeau to steal it. Things take a turn from there.\n\nVery enjoyable, with a very sweet ending.",

Those who have read the book will recognize the plot up to close to the end, where the movie veers off in its own attempt for a resolution that Lem did not seem to think necessary to provide in the novel.\n\nI was disappointed that the movie had almost nothing to say or show about the sentient ocean of Solaris and humanity&apos;s failure to comprehend it. The book went into great detail in describing the fantastic phenomena of the ocean and the various failed theories to explain them. In fact I think that was the central theme of the book which is almost completely lost in the movie."

It would have been great even without McQueen in the title role.\n\nDustin Hoffman was his usual superb actor, making the most out of his role. McQueen wisely avoided playing himself, and as a result, his role was stronger and believable.\n\nLocation scenes and overall plot were superb. \n\nOutstanding film."

      "reviewBody": "Asudem was made 4 or 5 years before Lars Von Trier made the Anti Christ. it is basically the same situation; with the difference that Shokof,s films are always permitted to show the way to others but never get to be screened for many reasons with being a black listed artist at the peak of the reasons. i remember all scenes from this marvelous great little film with imaginative camera perspectives that was probably made with the sweat of the people who worked with the film rater than any money available and the result is astonishing. some years later Lars WHO I RESPECT AND ALSO ADMIRE AS A DIRECTOR of better visions and thoughts gets perhaps the copy somewhere and is told to make this one over again, with some real money ,name actors and we have something? well, they did, and Anti Christ is a good film but this Asudem thing is in my opinion the real deal. much like Shokof,s mind blowing Seven Servants that was quickly adopted and taken as a concept by kiarostami the year after seven servants was made and hell guess what, they gave the guy the grand Cannes film festival prize for having made a copy with far less originality? Asudem is thought provoking, funny at best, scary and eerie just when it wants to be and free of all borders cause one can see shokof does not give a peanut who watches his movies and or if even his films would ever surface anyone,s attention. that exact thing makes his movies gold for me, and i for one sense that feeling that a master artist delivers something with messed up situations that could only explain how poorly these films of shokof have been financed and or financed at all? i loved asudem just like his great seven servants and wonderfully executed itler,s grave. this man will be registered as one creative mind one day when it is a good day. regardless of how long down the raod that day would be ,go and see asudem; and enjoy being entertained and crazed with a touch of a most ironic brushes of a master painter of our times.",

      "reviewBody": "This impressive comic-book style tale brought to big screen contains thought-provoking science-fiction , fantasy , noisy action , battles , thrills , violent fights and results to be pretty entertaining . Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a smart , feisty college student who suddenly finds herself involved into a horrific drug and human trafficking situation . Later on , her brain is permanently altered when the fantastic drug CPH4 is released in her body . Lucy being re-animated due to the incredible synthetic drug , getting superpowers , breathtaking force , fast healing and undergoing unimaginable changes. When she gets a kick to her abdomen, the drug starts to leak into her body , and she begins using more than 10% of her brain and finds that she has less than 24-48 hours to live . With her new abilities , as soon as Lucy comes to learn that not everything he learns can be trusted , subsequently executing a merciless revenge . She&apos;s a slain woman and when his memories flood back and recalls the man that killed him , she gets away of the facility hellbent on vengeance , only to discover that there&apos;s more to the conspiracy than she originally thought . Along the way , Lucy finds the one neuro-scientist and professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who can help capture her super brain phenomenon for the world , before the nasty villain , Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik) , kill her in the process. She has the Power ! . The average person uses 10% of their brain capacity. Imagine what she could do with 100%. Open your mind, expand your potential, evolve !.\n\nNail-biting superheroine flick with thrills , chills , plot twists , struggles , high body-count , moving scenes , dazzling production design and latest generation special effects . Based on the character created by Luc Besson himself and heavily influenced by Superheroes Comic Books . This is a dynamic , fast- paced , entertaining and fun movie . It packs a brief message about the extreme dangers of the drugs and science, as our starring gets a tremendous strength thanks to a peculiar drug , she becomes a superhuman , a killing machine , resulting in fateful consequences . But it was really made to appeal to wide range of audiences , so the plot wasn&apos;t so complex , but Scarlett Johansson as the prominently featured super-power heroine was absolutely believable , and there was no other actress at the time who could have played the role asides from her . Nohing more fun to watch than to see her running here and there while seeks vengeance going after the man who previously killed her , or at least, who he believes killed . It also helps that it usually has a relatively good storyline to go along with it . This show has one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast . Scarlett Johansson is nice , playing in her usual style as the two-fisted , serious girl brought back to life by an advanced technology that gives him the ability of super human strength , it would spin to transform into a relentless superheroine , armed with a invincible force that can stop any bullet , while regenerating his vital organs. Being well accompanied by other fine actors , such as : Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman , Choi Min-sik of Old Boy , Choi Min-sik , Amr Waked , Julian Rhind-Tutt , Pilou Asbæk , among others.\n\nIt displays a stinging and rousing musical score by composer Eric Serra . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Thierry Arbogast . The motion picture was professionally directed by Luc Besson , though it has some flaws , gaps and shortfalls . Lavishly produced by Eurocorps (Besson Production Company) and nicely made by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . Luc often casts Jean Reno (though here doesn&apos;t appear) and music always by Eric Serra . Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as ¨Leon¨ , ¨Joan of Arc¨ , ¨The fifth element¨ , the ¨Taxi¨ series , ¨Big blue¨ , ¨Arthur and the Minimois¨ , ¨Nikita¨ and many others . Rating : Acceptable and passable, 6 . This is a highly amusing and frequently fun action-adventure romp with a witty script, sensational special effects and accceptable performances from main and support cast .",

He made a mark at the box office right from his first film after it grossed more than its rival Lamhe (directed by veteran late Yash Chopra) which was released on the same day despite the latter being a better film.\n\nThe first half of the film is set as a love story with the second half turning into a family action drama which involves who&apos;s who of the city&apos;s underworld. In terms of performance it is Amrish Puri who steals the show as a underworld don who tries to mend relationship with his son (i.e. Ajay Devgn) &amp; goes up to any extend in doing it. Ajay Devgn impresses with his action sequences but there was nothing to note about his performance in terms of acting, the trend of acting in such films continued for the actor till mid/late 90s as many of his movies were of similar nature. Madhoo has a mediocre role as Ajay Devgn&apos;s lover/wife and has nothing to boast off (later on in 1992,the actress gains critical acclaim by starring in Roja). Raza Murad, Suresh Chatwal &amp; Satyen Kappu enact their respective roles in usual manner as villains &amp; supporting role.\n\nOn the whole it is an average film and a strict one time with Amrish Puri being the highlight of the film.",

How could anyone deny that this screenplay was anything less than original, or perfection.  Absolutely intoxicating.  The performances were right on and the writing was magnificent.  Kevin Smith is, without a doubt, one of the best new writers.  With this movie he goes to a whole new level.  &quot;Clerks&quot; was great, and I think I&apos;m one of the five people that enjoyed &quot;Mallrats&quot;, but &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; takes the cake.  Nothing else came even close that year. That movie should have made a star out of Joey Lauren Adams.  She gave the BEST performance in 1997 and was robbed of an Oscar nomination, as was the script.  The scene outside of the ice rink is more than enough to show just how good she was.  And anyone who can watch that ending, the you don&apos;t know if you should cry or jump for joy ending, and not feel something, is heartless.  The movie was great.  It is one of my personal favorites, and will always be.",

      "reviewBody": "Taps is about the cadets of Bunker Hill Military Academy and their commanding officer, George C. Scott, and their reaction to the news of the closing of the Academy.\n\nScott announces at the graduation that the next year will be the final year of Bunker Hill. The Board of Trustees is selling off the place for its prime real estate value to be used for condominium development. Certainly an occurrence we&apos;ve seen all over the country in many places and not something really desirable in many.\n\nCadet Major Timothy Hutton knows he will head the last graduating class at Bunker Hill. He and fellow cadets like Sean Penn and Tom Cruise aren&apos;t taking it lying down. They may be military cadets, but they&apos;ve seen and grown up with student protests. Only these students have weapons and are trained in their use. \n\nCan you really blame the cadets like Hutton who&apos;ve actually in fact forgotten that soldiers carry out and don&apos;t make policy? I think it was significant that during the course of Taps it&apos;s mentioned that George C. Scott served with General Douglas MacArthur who gave him a sword for his service. It&apos;s also mentioned that Scott was passed over for promotion an advancement beyond being a brigadier general and was retired comfortably out to pasture at the Academy.\n\nScott&apos;s not the same kind of military man you see in Patton. Rather he&apos;s a lot like the Patton you see in that television film, Patton, the Last Days. A man so totally out of his element that when the accident and broken neck occurred he&apos;d lost his will to live.\n\nAnyway after a scuffle with some of the town louts who are less than enamored of Bunker Hill&apos;s military tradition. A town kid is accidentally killed when he tries to get Scott&apos;s military issue pistol and it discharges. In a court of law, the man would have been acquitted, but Scott answers to a higher law he lives by. \n\nThat scuffle threatens to close the school even for the last year and the kids seize it. It&apos;s a confrontation then between idealistic and wrongheaded youth and the real forces of law enforcement.\n\nRonny Cox contributes a very nice performance as the commanding general of the National Guard trying to keep a lid on the situation. His scenes with the idealistic and obstinate Hutton are the highlight of the film for me.\n\nTom Cruise and Sean Penn got their first real notice in this film right at the start of their respective mega-careers. Hutton has a nice followup to his Oscar winning performance from Ordinary People. And George C. Scott is, George C. Scott.",

It ain&apos;t so tasty.\n\nI&apos;m taking the time to write these comments as this is for sure one of the oddest flicks I&apos;ve seen, but in no way is it a lazy piece. From the opening credits, the production value is noticeable and clever processing effects actually make this look mainstream. It&apos;s not until we get into the hardcore molestation of zombie by human and visa versa that things (for me I stress) go awry and I began asking - &apos;who is this movie for?&apos; If there is such a person, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d like to meet them.\n\nThere&apos;s a nice atmospheric feel to the production with a particular grainy 16mm effect I liked. The actors are all clearly professionals and the lighting/direction/gore is all executed well (considering budget); but I couldn&apos;t help wishing that the two subjects had been handled in separate works by the same director. I reckon he could make a good looking budget zombie flick and certainly a quality bit of porn; but I guess perhaps I&apos;m missing the point here.\n\nI like my zombies, I love my porn, but (for me) never the twain should meet. Applaudible effort though.\n\nP.S. My advice, don&apos;t put your ghoulies in a ghouls&apos; mouth, it&apos;ll end in tears.",

Hesitating at first, Joni eventually puts in a call to the sperm bank, who puts her in touch with Paul, a restaurant owner and all around &quot;cool dude&quot; who seems willing to meet the kids he never knew he had. As Paul arrives in their lives the family is thrown into disarray and sticky situations that threatens the stability of this already unusual family.\n\nThe Good: The acting is great with good chemistry between Nic and Jules. Well what else would you expect of Annette Benning and Julianne Moore and not to forget, Mark Ruffalo. And the younger actors (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) give believable and very good performances.\n\nAlso the films is very energetic and never really looses your attention.\n\nThe Bad: The Films stumbles around a bit not really knowing if it&apos;s a romantic comedy or a a family drama specially at the end but fortunately stays true to its core."

      "name": "A sheer fireworks of colors",
      "reviewBody": "While Kaestner&apos;s book, written in 1949 right after World War II, focuses on the political content, the film is most striking for its images: very brightly colored, mostly in agitated movement, spanning vast ranges of styles not to be expected in an animated movie: landscapes in the style of romanticism, traditional silhouette, some iconography bordering surrealism, lots of people and machinery reminiscent of George Grosz, a bit of Pop Art, but, above all, the aesthetics of the Hippie generation: Light, gay, psychedelic colors, flowers and small peaceful birds all over the place. Given that the film was turned in the same year that saw Woodstock, and the fact that the content is a pacifist parable, turning to hippie style is perhaps not to be wondered at. The sheer fireworks of colors makes the movie worth viewing...\n\nDeplorably, though, the film team was so keen on playing with colors and pictures that several other aspects required to make a good movie have been neglected. Even though they had a good basic plot to work on, it is rendered in a rather sketchy way. There are long stretches of cheap slapstick comedy that could have been left out without any loss. The characters remain unconvincing, inexpressive and schematic and do not evolve during the plot - least of all the children, even though it&apos;s the children all this is supposedly about. This is particularly surprising and disappointing since the movie is based on a work of Erich Kaestner, a writer most famous for his vivid and affectionate depictions of children&apos;s characters.\n\nYoung children will, no doubt, enjoy the colors, the pictures, and the slapstick. Still, this is not just a movie for children. Children of about six years or a bit more will miss many of the political sub-tones, and in fact, when i was watching the film, quite a few times children in the auditorium loudly complained to their parents: &quot;What is this, what is happening now?&quot; My impression is that the film-makers rather played on their own imagination, their own tastes, and their own connotations, in the world of grown-ups - up to and including, just to name one example, an allusion to Nikita Khrushchev hammering the U.N. conference table with his shoe, an event that happened ten years earlier and would hardly be known to young children, even near the end of the Sixties.\n\nI don&apos;t know whether Kaestner liked the way the film-makers played with his book, obviously rather for their own amusement than for pleasing others, or even pleasing children. But he might have, for he once said: &quot;Only those who grow up but still remain children are human.&quot;",

When I originally viewed this movie it was more of a good guy or girl versus a bad guy. Today on a cable movie network I watched it and was in awe of the beauty I missed as a young lad. Watch the movie for content, for Jack Lemon, Ernie Kovacks, or just because of Doris; but take a moment to observe the buildings, the towns, the scenery featured during the train ride, or just to see the townspeople in the parade at the end and maybe you will find yourself asking these same questions.\n\nWhere did the filming of this movie actually take place? Was the parade the actual city&apos;s population and band? Why did the movie industry abandon a wholesome Americana for such violent and explicit movies? It Happened to Jane; is a wonderful movie that should be a real life experience that happens to all of us. This today was more like a journey back to my childhood than just watching a movie. Perhaps if we as movie goers supported this venue of entertainment, then we might get back to being America the Beautiful as beautiful as she once was. Yes, she is still the best place in the world, but wouldn&apos;t it be grand to return to those happy glorious Doris Day(s) of yesteryear. R. John a fan of America the Beautiful",

The story is simply told and allowed to stand on its own. The story is one of those that would not be believable on the big screen if it were not true in all of its essential points. The beautiful jungle scenery (the movie was shot in Panama) is well worth the price of the ticket. But the story will make you think about how self-giving love is more powerful than violence. The story also shows that extraordinary risks taken for peace can pay dividends beyond imagination. This will be a movie that people will be talking about, and watching again and again, far into the future. You&apos;ll be sorry if you don&apos;t take the opportunity to see it on the big screen. You&apos;ll also wonder why an independent film company can make such a wonderful movie when Hollywood is making bad movies based on old TV shows."

      "reviewBody": "Track of the Moon Beast has a simple story to tell you, a meteor falls turning a man into a lizard beast when the moon is full. \n\nAt the start some jokers make a howling noise in the hills to mildly surprise their friends. When they emerge after this merry jape they gobble up about ten minutes of screen time explaining the whys and wherefores of this little gag. But it doesn&apos;t end there, the entire film is littered with explanations of things you neither care about nor really need to know. Oh remember when you did this? What about the time this happened? Show it, or shut up about it! Most of it isn&apos;t relevant anyway.\n\nThe acting in this one is just horrible and the script is full of moments where they all laugh and share a warm moment that excludes the audience because what they are laughing about isn&apos;t funny and what&apos;s going on is really drab and boring. The monster is a joke, day turns to night and night to day randomly and the whole thing alternately looks like it was filmed about six inches from the sun or inside a black hole depending on whether or not they remembered to turn the lighting on before shooting a scene.\n\nThis is one boring pointless movie, so little happens that within fifteen minutes of it ending you&apos;ll be hard pressed to remember one significant scene. Even bad movie fans will struggle to find anything entertaining with this one."

      "reviewBody": "In the French countryside, a beautiful red-headed girl spies a fox. Its love at first glance. Thereafter, the young lass uses much of her free time looking through the meadows and woods for her new friend. At one point, the young girl breaks a leg and must stay indoors for quite a spell. Her parents bring her books on foxes, which she devours. Soon, she is back outside, after the winter has passed. Meanwhile, the fox has had a scary run-in with a wild cat but made it to a hole, exhausted but alive. She also finds her mate and delivers two young foxes. Through some instinctive miracle, the fox does let the young girl pet her from time to time. Also, when a large bird of prey decides on a young fox meal, the girl is there to cover the pup with her body until the danger has passed. Will the girl and her fox remain friends forever? This is a stunningly beautiful film, with superb photography. Animal lovers will rejoice at seeing the world through a fox&apos;s eyes and admire the little girl&apos;s avid interest in the natural world near her home. Also, Kate Winslet&apos;s English narration is quite wonderful, too. But, alas, the scary moments are very real, for nature is often cruel. This will upset younger children and sensitive viewers, who love creatures but hate the harsh eat-or-be-eaten world. This reviewer, for example, couldn&apos;t finish the film, for there were too many &quot;close calls&quot; for the fox and her family. But, if you are the type who can just celebrate the life of animals, no matter what the results, this is probably a film you don&apos;t want to overlook.",

      "reviewBody": "This is probably the most action-packed film I have ever seen - and I have seen quite a few. Unlike in many Italian films of the seventies, not much time is wasted on phony emotional slush. There are no slow-motion shots and few &quot;face studies&quot; so typical of cheap cinema,where poliziottesci generally belong. The story is usually quite believable and logical but also pleasantly fresh and unpredictable. Action scenes are imaginative and realistic - I particularly liked the car chases - though some fight scenes do look rather wooden and the the punches are always much too loud. Maurizio Merli does not overact too much (especially if compared with Franco Nero). He does a really nice job as a tough but likable inspector. He chases the criminals, but can also be lenient with those who want to mend their ways. There is also a nice romantic element in the story. Another advantage of the film is the absence of politics. One is frequently unpleasantly surprised at the amount of naive leftist brain-washing in Italian action cinema of the 70s. (eg. Milano callibro 9) I don&apos;t understand the undeservedly low rating of this film in imdb(5.9. I have also seen &apos;La polizia incrimina, la legge assolve&apos; by Castellari, rated at 7.5, and I think this is a much better film. The dialogues are good though I can&apos;t guarantee for the translations. Learn Italian and see the original. However, this is not a family cinema. A few scenes are really rough, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend the film to anybody under 15.",

He suddenly becomes his character, he stops seeing around him and he is now a prisoner in his role.\n\nThe movie is about Pacino. His acting is grand, superb, majestic, heart-wrenching, deep, emotional, so forth. His portrayal of a blind man dangling in the rope of his life, is not only credible but immensely touching. We see directly, through his crystalline performance all of the pain that griefs on his character. Any other actor would have given a corny, over the top performance. Pacino is the Ace.\n\nChris O&apos; Donnell gives also a fantastic performance, shy and unsure will start to understand Colonel Frank Slade in a short trip that will change their future lives. This movie is not Hollywood Rubish. Martin Brest directs a movie that hits no cheap feelings and floods on great emotions that immediately contact the viewer. You have to be rock solid to not be touched.\n\nA masterpiece, one of the best studies on man&apos;s desperation, helped by wonderful performances and and a stirring, poignant script, with no wasted lines. You will raise goosebumps with scenes like the tango scene, you will laugh, you will cry, you will feel empathy, sorrow, anger. Isn&apos;t this movie the Holy Grail of Emotions.\n\nDon&apos;t miss it. One of a kind.",

I don&apos;t think the Woman who made this ever did a movie before, but her direction, cutting and empathy with the characters is amazing. This is much more than the music, more than the characters and more than the history which came and cast them asunder. Director Safinez Bousbia stirred and mixed it all together like a great cook. Here this character, here that one, here the music, here this city, here that, here the revolution, then back again. The resulting meal is fit for Shahryar, the King as he listens to Sheherezade, the storyteller. It is not Perfect, so it doesn&apos;t get a ten. But it is way, way up there.",

      "reviewBody": "Truncated from a 200-minute TV film entitled &quot;Nessuno O Tutti&quot; (No One or Everyone) &quot;Fit to Be Untied&quot; is a 1975 documentary made by an Italian filmmakers&apos; collective, attacking the system of mental hospitals in Italy. Integrating mental patients into the community at large is the pic&apos;s alternative, awkwardly linked by the activist helmers to various Communist and &quot;workers unite&quot; sentiments expressed by the interviewees on camera.\n\nFormat is talking heads interviews. With former patients and their community sponsors presenting a somewhat monolithic point-of-view. Film&apos;s strength lies in the fascinating nature of what these folks have to say, though in the main the deck has been loaded by selectively focusing on articulate, appealing people (with the implication that there are no seriously ill mental cases around requiring isolation and treatment).\n\nFirst hour of the docu centers on three young men: Paolo, a cute husky-voiced hell-raiser; Angelo, a militant Communist, and a retarded kid Marco, who clearly are better off on the outside than in hospitals. Similarly, a shop foreman at a factory shows us several happy workers who happen to be retarded nor mongoloid, but are leading effective lives as part of the group. He even argues that patients in psychiatric hospitals should unionize to improve their living conditions.\n\nA target of the filmmakers is Catholic Church-run hospitals, with footage included of their inability to film inside such institutions or obtain interviews. Unlike Frederick Wiseman&apos;s pioneer work in the genre, the 1966 &quot;Titicut Follies&quot;, footage does not present the conditions or day-to-day life inside hospitals, and thus lacks the force of an exposé. Lensing is haphazard, with 35mm blowup grainy and cropping off foreheads.\n\nMy review was written in September 1981 after a New York Film Festival screening."

      "name": "Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a pleasant, little series that makes good use of its time, but covers a simplistic story.",
      "reviewBody": "Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a, totaling to fifty minutes, OVA series that tells a simple, yet sweet, story of love. Usually when a series is limited on run-time it&apos;s common to see consistent issues in pacing and proper, satisfactory closure. First seeing that Tokyo Marble Chocolate only had two normal-length episodes to it, I assumed this would end up being the case, but Production I.G. has done a great job many times in the past. Luckily, that talent translates to this small work as well.\n\nAs the project was worked on by Production I.G., the studio behind Attack on Titan, it isn&apos;t a surprise to note that the budget for this OVA series gave it some great visuals. The animation is good and the art style is bright and pleasant. The music is also satisfying with a classy, violin-like sound throughout, topping itself with a couple, great, vocal songs. The sound work was well done, and there was never a moment where it felt as if the atmosphere could be better presented.\n\nThat leads into the direction of the series, which I found to be wonderful and the greatest source of intrigue for this series. Being the anime is limited to fifty minutes and the story of love it tells isn&apos;t too complex, the director did a fabulous job of keeping explanations to the character&apos;s pasts to a minimum by presenting who the characters are through their actions in their current, connecting situation. Each episode covers the same situation, however, each episode shifts that situation to a different perspective of the other character&apos;s mindset. The budget doesn&apos;t take advantage of that fact too much, and there never grew a feeling that the reused art was restricting the enjoyment, as there are inclusions of new angles and completely different shots of the different characters in seclusion. Towards the direction, the director did a great job on this series and made a short, two- episode OVA memorable and enjoyable.\n\nThe characters mainly involve the two lovers who are in a conflict of trying to understand and admit their feeling to one-another, even though they are already going out. This leads to brief conflicts and confusion that restrict them from easily clearing up one-another&apos;s thoughts. Each character has a past history of failing in relationships through fear and goofy mistakes. They treat the current romance between each-other as another likely relationship that is destined to break. The series is accompanied by a few other characters with a decent amount of screen-time, but they aren&apos;t delved into. However, they are still treated in a way that makes them memorable, at least in the time upon completing the viewing.\n\nAnother character this series includes is the trope of the merchandising creature, that tends to serve as comic relief. However, in this case, it was a pleasant surprise to slowly understand that this creature actually served a direct purpose in the plot and wasn&apos;t only there as decor. The creature made its place and even made some pushes at rallying the plot forward, which could be seen as contrivances, but remembering this story is nothing too unique may lead one to be forgiving to such a thought.\n\nThis short series, Tokyo Marble Chocolate, tells a simple story of love in an interesting way that is well-presented. While the plot elements are enjoyable to an extent, the bulk of interest comes from the directing and the precise amount of time placed into each scene. Even though each episode covers the same situation, the OVA is still able to make the viewer get to know each character to a satisfactory level and is able to keep the pacing, and turn of events, to a degree that will constantly keep interest. Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a nice, little series with some good staff behind it, but is still simplistic in its story and characters, which is understandable due to the time restraint it holds.",

      "reviewBody": "From one of the popular corners of the city of Casablanca in morocco the &quot;Hay Mohammadi&quot; area emerged a band full of spirit and fond of sacred and sublime music. The most known band of its time emerged to make generations live in trance. &quot;Nass El Ghiwan&quot; is a group of youth eager to produce art, living in trance with their art, and making their fan live in trance with their music.\n\nThe movie starts with a ride on a car around the neighborhoods where the youth has first met and decided to make a band with &quot;Larbi Batma&quot;, &quot;Omar Sayed&quot;, &quot; Abdelaziz Tahiri&quot;, then &quot;Abderrahmane Paco&quot;. The movie shows &quot;Nass El Ghiwan&quot; animating a successful concert in Tunisia and at the same time switch to show flashes of their personality throw some aspects of their life. The band still remembers &quot;Boujmii&quot; who died some time ago, but still has his existence in the memory of his colleagues and fans. They dedicated the concert to &quot;Boujmii&quot; as an acknowledgment to his contribution to &quot;Nass El Giwane&quot;. Tunisian fans seem very overwhelmed by the rhythm and the lyrics, repeating the songs and dancing.\n\nBefore forming a band, each member&apos;s fondness of music prevented him from a former way he had once followed in life; music seems to be in their blood. They are together inventing their musicor, each one by himself seeking new rhythms.\n\nLike a documentary presenting the biography of &quot;Nass El Ghiwane&quot; band, there are moments in this movie when each person talks about his feelings, expectations, why he chose to become an artist, and all the answers refer to the fact that they are born with that passion inside, which wasn&apos;t to be manifested otherwise except by producing art.\n\nThe Moroccan Beatles have created an irresistible atmosphere thanks to the very traditional Moroccan instruments of music they use like &quot;bendir&quot;, &quot;banjo&quot;, &quot;tarija&quot;, &quot; da&apos;dou&apos; &quot; and &quot; darbouka&quot;. This is what makes their music very Moroccan and special, in addition to the contribution of each element of the band who brought his own spirit and origins to that music. So, we can find an amalgamation between Gnawi, Berber, Ita, Malhoun, etcthe topics of their songs are political, religious, social, and rebellious.\n\nThis movie is full of nostalgia; it is very simple but very close to heart. Watching this movie, I felt how serious are &quot;Nass El Giwane&quot;, and how much they loved their music to make it so original. Casablanca city as the main scene of action looks able to swallow all the varieties, differences and contradictions to produce &quot;Nass El Ghiwane&quot; legend.",

I didn&apos;t know anything about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, but still decided to give it a go.\n\nI managed to make it through a staggering 49 minutes of prolonged suffering as I watched &quot;Staunton Hill&quot;. Then I just simply gave up out of sheer and profound boredom. Very little happened through the 49 minutes that I managed to endure, it was quite boring and uneventful.\n\nThere was some good enough scenes at the farmstead with some bloody and gore-filled visuals. But that hardly managed to lift up the less than mediocre overall result that the movie turned out to be.\n\nThe characters in the movie were not particularly interesting, and they were actually generic, one-dimensional and lacking personality and layers. As such, it felt like watching cardboard cut-outs of the characters waltz around on the screen.\n\nI can in all honesty say that I have no intention of returning to &quot;Staunton Hill&quot; to see if the movie picks up or not. Because from what I saw from the 49 minutes deterred me permanently. If you enjoy horror movies, then there are far, far better choices readily available in the horror genre.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In an action film you act in the action. If it&apos;s a dramatic film you act in a drama&quot; (Jean Claude Van Damme).\n\nHaving seen 80 MILLION directed by Waldemar Krzystek on the big screen, I experienced something not so common when applied to Polish cinema: smiles of satisfaction. 80 MILLION, selected for the Best Foreign Language Oscar, proves a considerable achievement as a drama but foremost as an effective action movie. 80 MILLION beautifully meets the standards of any American film with some portion of violence, sex but, above all, thrilling action. Although the film tells a story of true events that took place in historic (for Poland) December 1981 when the communist regime announced the martial law (the action is set in Wroclaw and the film is shot on location there), the content of the film does not require a viewer to be much knowledgeable about the historical events. Why? \n\n80 MILLION, in its background, is a depiction of People&apos;s Republic of Poland in the early 1980s - the gray lives of people oppressed within regime. This historical backdrop, however, is used by the director as a clever conceit to frame the plot. Mind you that there is not one protagonist that would make a film a sort of appraisal of one person&apos;s heroism. It is neither a documented depiction of Solidarnosc movement and its ideals. There is, nevertheless, Lech Walesa in the background but, rightly so, he appears on TV - idea rather than a concrete character. Nothing is &apos;heroic&apos; but rather &apos;humane&apos; there are more people, more simple members of Solidarnosc who are not afraid to oppose to the cruelty of those in power. In that respect, Joanna Morena in her review on the film nicely observes that &quot;people are in the foreground.&quot; Wladyslaw Frasyniuk (Filip Bobek), Maks (Marcin Bosak), Staszek (Wojciech Solarz) represent those &apos;brothers in arms&apos; - indefatigable in their fights. Much happens in their lives in these days and much is being photographed...They have their shortcomings, sure, but their mutual target makes them solidarity, united. Their stories incorporate a wide range of experiences from courage to fear, from loyalty to treason.\n\n80 MILLION is, on the other hand, a fine example of human complexity cinematically personified. It seems that villains, though we don&apos;t like them, are most &apos;unforgettable.&apos; Are there any villains in this film? Here I would like to highlight the character of Sobczak skillfully and memorably played by Piotr Glowacki. He is seemingly the incarnation of the communist power...however, in the long run, it occurs that he is driven more by some personal, hateful motives than ideals he hardly believes in. Sobczak shocks us as a character but, at the same time, he perfectly stimulates viewers to psychoanalyze a man who has &apos;some&apos; power over other people. What hidden drives come out of him, indeed, his character reinforces the duality of human nature and his character is more complex than some viewers would expect. Consider the scene at the archbishop&apos;s palace and his vulgarism that works as a disguise of inner fear. He spills the beans about the state of communist regime of the time but, foremost, the state of his inner self...Full credit for the actor!\n\n80 MILLION is, foremost, an intriguing and thrilling detective story. The set of the gray People&apos;s Republic of Poland does not constitute any obstacle to execute an excellently absorbing action drama. The title 80 million Polish zloty, which belongs to Solidarnosc, is taken from the bank (a huge sum for the time) a few days before the martial law and hidden at the archbishop&apos;s palace. The tension that keeps a viewer in a chair while every little step is being counted is convincing. At the same time, humor may leak through the walls of gray censorship. Many scenes, in that respect, make the film highly worth seeing.\n\nRiveting entertainment and a new glimpse of quite a depressing period of Polish history that did not lack creative and brave people, anyway. Poland&apos;s effective story and an interesting gift of thrill to international audiences.",

I can&apos;t imagine a married studio executive actually touching and almost kissing a writer ON THE LOT. I found myself imagining what other actors would have done with the role, never a good sign. But then again, he was one of the producers, so Mr. Lucas had his hands tied.\n\nAll in all, the first act was so promising that I was angered by the way Lucas decided to end it.",

So I admit that, watching it in another country 2014 there may be quite a lot of context I&apos;m missing. This is not a life of Chapev, whom everyone is presumed to know well, but a series of episodes from his career. \n\nThey are not all uninteresting or dull episodes, but the fact that it is so episodic rather than following a more complete story worked against it with me in this case. \n\nIt&apos;s inescapably hero-worship, and, commendably given that it is hero- worship, it does not try to portray its hero as immaculate. Chapaev is proud, short-tempered, and ignorant of politics and history. But this played against his advantages only serves to make him more of a hero. \n\nIt easy to see why this film became very popular -- it&apos;s good-humored, politically-correct for its political context, and appeals to existing conceptions of a popular hero. The battle scenes are staged on a big scale and are very impressive (though the ending seems quite abrupt). Taken out of its immediate context, though, it doesn&apos;t stand alone as well as a self-contained film for other audiences. But it remains a fascinating piece of history.",

Reviewers are really a bunch of whole assets, arent they?  They probably are not too good at acting, screenwriting, directing or producing (though they might do okay as continuity persons!).  Jackson, Garcia, Judd and several lesser players are just fine.  Reviewers write to keep themselves working for a living, and that requires them to diss a goodly percentage of the movies they review."

      "reviewBody": "Back in the 30s and 40s, there was a kind of movie known as the women&apos;s picture. These were typically romantic dramas told from a female perspective, and while they often featured headstrong intelligent women (at least by the standards of typical portrayals), they would often have some kind of moral at the end about being a loyal and obedient wife as a kind of final goal in a woman&apos;s life. It was a long time, even years after the era of women&apos;s lib that patriarchy in the movies began to be completely deconstructed. The subject of women driven to murder by the actions of men was not a new one when Thelma &amp; Louise was made in 1991. But if you look at a picture like Play Misty for Me from two decades earlier, where a used woman becomes the antagonist in a Psycho-type thriller, or I Spit on your Grave (1978) in which a woman&apos;s revenge for being raped could only be shown in a lurid exploitation movie, we can see how far the perspective has had to shift.\n\nThelma &amp; Louise, brilliantly scripted by Callie Kouri, gives an explanation for violence by women towards men, and it does so with amazing simplicity. There are no explicit arguments made. No character makes an overt feminist statement – the closest it comes to that is a by-the-way reminder by Geena Davis to the abducted policeman to be nice to his wife. The message, as it were, is up there in the screen as the story takes place. And although the basic outline of Thelma &amp; Louise is very much out-of-the-ordinary for most women, if you break it down moment by moment, the men they encounter and the exchanges they have are very much on the near side of normal.\n\nA lot of Thelma &amp; Louise&apos;s power is in its magnificent cast. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have a remarkable realism that demonstrates a great rapport between the two characters. When they laugh together, it&apos;s the laughter of two friends. Sarandon is brilliant at keeping that mystery to her character – the secret in Louise&apos;s past is bubbling under the surface of her performance long before it is revealed to the audience. Davis does an excellent job of showing character development, growing from the sheltered housewife into an independent woman comfortable with her newfound criminality. And it&apos;s neat how her sense of playfulness remains somehow consistent even as she changes. There are plenty of decent supporting performances as well. Brad Pitt was obviously chosen primarily for his youthful good looks, but he can act with it. Michael Madsen is very good too, intimidating in his controlled anger, but radiating a presence that makes his attractiveness to Louise understandable.\n\nThe movie is directed by that meticulous craftsman Ridley Scott. He manages the movement in the frame with expert control for the right effect. In the opening scenes, the camera follows Sarandon around the chaos of the café. As she moves into a backroom during her phone call to Davis, the movement in the background tails off but is kept going by the chef juggling a can, and then as she moves across further the backdrop becomes the tranquil fish tank. These natural-looking set-ups are carefully controlling the mood of the image. As this road movie progresses, the backgrounds become increasingly wide open and breathtakingly beautiful, in line with the spirits of its protagonists. Scott culminates all this with some wonderful stylisation in the final action sequence. The movie would be in danger of becoming overly technical if it wasn&apos;t for his almost constant focus on Davis and Sarandon&apos;s faces, such as their quiet smiles as they cross Monument Valley by night.\n\nFor all its feminist modernity, as a type of movie, Thelma &amp; Louise treads familiar ground. The story of sympathetic criminals running free across the country as fate closes in can be seen in such classics as High Sierra (1941), Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Really, the only major difference here is that the criminals are both women, not a couple of male hoods or a gangster and his moll. And yet, all it takes is this simple gender substitution to speak volumes about the experience of women in this society. That it does so without resorting to sermonising, and keeping up a healthy feeling of fun, makes Thelma &amp; Louise an outstanding motion picture.",

Further, it shows the birth of a performing arts movement that most of us have not been aware it existed. Congratulations to all of those who were part of this Dzi cultural movement for paving the way for those who wanted to be free to perform and express their views. Also, the first hand interviews by reputable actors, who were directly influenced by their ideas, gives good historical validation of what really happened. Overall its a great film and should definitely be watched by everyone that enjoys documentaries.",

      "reviewBody": "At first glance, DAY OF THE COBRA is a spiritual remake of Castellari&apos;s genre-defining HIGH CRIME. Both take place in Genoa, both star Franco Nero as a tough-as-nail law enforcement character fighting drug dealers, both feature a kid getting nailed by a car, and a henchman being shot in the groin from below.\n\nUnfortunately this film just doesn&apos;t have the same energy going for it. Everything feels markedly smaller and cheaper and the plot goes a bit too far out to be believable with plenty of silly dialog. It also contains some surprisingly poor performances and far too many instances of Enzo alluding to his other, better films. Nero&apos;s real life son Carlo acts in the film (as himself basically) but his subplot seems overall unconnected and just strange.\n\nWhat the film does have are a few exciting foot chase scenes and a silly fistfight between Nero and a transsexual. The main theme song is silly but very hummably infectious and the whole movie moves at a brisk, though casual pace. Sybil Danning provides some welcome if brief nudity, and we learn here that she actually wears high heels in bed. Also worth mentioning is the excellent supporting &quot;dream team&quot; cast of legendary Italian stuntmen such as Rocco Lerro, Massimo Vanni, Angelo Ragusa, and Romano Puppo all allowed to display their respective talents as various henchmen.\n\nOverall though the film is just too pedestrian and mediocre. Probably the least of Castellari/Nero teamings though still a cut above most of the pack of later Eurocrime movies.",

      "reviewBody": "This was one of the last motion pictures made in Germany during World War II and gives one the feel for mid war period in that country.\n\nWhile the Nazi Government is never mentioned, the film appeals to the German&apos;s work ethic in crafting the aeronautical tools for Victory, final victory as in &quot;Endsieg&quot;. From the background one can see that the movie was filmed on site at Heinkle Aircraft&apos;s Rostock on the Baltic facility. Matter of fact the &quot;owner&quot; of the factory even looks like Ernst Heinkle, the real owner of Heinkle. There are nice line ups of the standard Heinkle 111 bombers of the period, and if you look closely you&apos;ll see The secret Heinkle 177 &quot;Greif&quot; in a background shot that the censors must have missed. &quot;Production for the Front&quot; should be the sub title of this movie as the factory scenes involving the young apprentices spending every moment for a few weeks working overtime producing cockpits for the He-111 to replace those lost in a &quot;fire&quot; (wartime bombing?&quot;) seems to be the message of the film. The theme music and pieces through out the movie are catchy if you see the movie more than once you may find yourself humming some of the tunes next day! The cast is very professional, my German is not that good, but most of the words can be easily understood and the plot followed. Actually quite a few plots thread through this one but that seems to be common in German wartime movies.\n\nEberhard Krüger at the young age of nine or so is easily recognised as the, now older, Hardy Kruger of US movies. The rest of the cast puts on a very impressive performance considering that this was made to induce a younger viewing population to consider working in aviation production at an early age.\n\nIf you like what you see the first viewing, try and see it a few more times to completely understand it.",

This movie is just dismal. Obviously shot on DV and starring a cast of poorly-played stereotypes, SIMON SAYS feels like a student-film... it tries hard at times, but just keeps failing. Story - non-existent Characters - generic and stiff Dialogue - embarrassing SFX - way wayyyy too much (unconvincing) CGI\n\nI wanted to just stop the flick early and end my pain, but ultimately I was drawn to know what on earth Crispin Glover saw in this project. I mean, maybe he did it strictly for the money (and if this production *DID* ever have a budget, certainly most of it MUST have gone to his salary). I have to presume that&apos;s the only reason he signed-onto this pile of crap. \n\nAvoid this one.

      "reviewBody": "I rented this flick hearing rumors it was good, damn was that an understatement. This movie was mind-blowing. Being an indie filmmaker myself, I was amazed at the simple creativity, style and thought that went into this gem. Being written and directed by three individuals had me a little skeptical, but it definitely worked in their favour.\n\nFirst off, the begginning of the film got my attention right off the bat, It was quick, stylish and bold. The following first sequence was just as striking. It moved with lightening pace and with intensity. The middle section added some great dead-pan humour, that I found myself laughing out loud at, then literally jumping back into suspense and intensity. The last third of the film, rounded the story out in a realistic and grim style, that also stood out on it&apos;s own. I didn&apos;t want this movie to end.\n\nThe characters were very well developed throughout the story, and added to the humour and chills, slipping seamlessly from humorous situations, to the insane and horrific. The fx were excellent and not over used.\n\nOverall, I&apos;d have to say the story, though conceived before in other ways, worked soo damn well here because of the way it was brought about by the directors. Kudos to the filmmakers for a very sic, groundbreaking and inspiring piece of work.",

      "reviewBody": "A class of Israeli junior high kids has discovered a miracle in its midst. One of the students, Clara, a 13 year old Russian immigrant, has begun to see the future. This singular talent arrives suddenly like an unexpected blessing from the gods of puberty, and for a few exciting days, Clara&apos;s predictions about math tests and lottery numbers turn her world upside down.\n\nAnd what a world it is. The film, released in 1996, is set three years in the future in an absurdist, industrial cityscape. The school kids talk tough about revolution as they tromp through polluted swamps and through streets lined with huge squares of beehive apartment buildings. The city seems on the very cusp of apocalypse, though it&apos;s not clear whether the final crisis will arise from a man-made ecological disaster or from the hand of God in the form of an earthquake. Meanwhile, the revolution threatens to develop into a new religion, with Saint Clara at the center. The entire city listens for her predictions, adult men get crushes on her, and of course the boys in her class end up fighting over her.\n\nTo complicate things for Clara, her powers may disappear if she falls in love. One of her admirers, Tikel, has a good chance with her though. He&apos;s obsessed with her violet eyes, and chicks always fall for that--at least in junior high. &quot;I think your visions come from your eyes,&quot; he tells her.\n\n&quot;Saint Clara&quot; really is about as good as films get. It is a beautiful thing to be able to imagine the near-future, accelerate the world&apos;s problems slightly, and then just continue to smile at life. In this way, &quot;Saint Clara&quot; is reminiscent of the irresistibly optimistic films Wim Wenders made during the 1990s. Perhaps the film&apos;s best surprise, however, is the voracious, adolescent energy which tints its vision. All the kids in the film are bursting with potential, thirsty for life; and the adults are sad but charming caricatures, thinly-veiled trolls and witches, forever dreaming of their lost youth. A naive misconception, certainly, but here it is also fantastically endearing.\n\nKudos to Kino Video for making this gem available on video. And don&apos;t miss the sweet little film at the end of the tape: &quot;Personal Goals.&quot;",

Only the likes of &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, or &quot;Elf&quot; (and a few others) can invoke such laughs, smiles, and tears as &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot;.",

      "name": "Twisted and Enjoyable Bad News Bears Western",
      "reviewBody": "I knew this movie would rule just by encountering a description of it, but I did now know how well written and insightful it really is, as far as blending a Western with the BAD NEWS BEARS formula of having kids take on adult qualities for a comedy film aimed at adults. I still remember the bitter disappointment of not being allowed to go see the original BAD NEWS BEARS because the film was Rated R and filled with profanity, vulgar humor, smoking, drinking, jokes about athletic cups and other things that my parents felt would not be a good influence.\n\nI wonder what they would have thought of KID TERROR OF THE WEST, Tonino Ricci and Bruno Corbucci&apos;s later period Spaghetti Western about a band of tykes who get mixed up in a gold robbery in order to save their parent&apos;s land from a bunch of shady swindlers. While not as foul-mouthed as BAD NEWS BEARS this is also an action/comedy film for adults, though there really isn&apos;t any content in it beyond your average &quot;family&quot; kind of fare. The distinction is that much of the film&apos;s more twisted humor will probably be lost on kids, who would instead be amused by the more playful vulgarities of the script.\n\nThe gang of kids is a colorful bunch: There&apos;s the son of the famed pistol fighter, the son of the sheriff, a kid with red hair and freckles, another one who stutters, a kid who constantly needs to take a leak, various angelic young ladies dolled up like JonBenet Ramsey, a moppet Chinese kickboxer bambino with eyes for the hero, the schemer kid and the clumsy kid and the musical kid who plays the piano named &quot;Fingers&quot;, of course. They all have some pretty colorful names, my favorite being &quot;Crackers&quot; and &quot;Lollipop&quot;, both of which seem like sly jokes about character stereotype -- Lollipop is an androgynous boy or a girl dressed up as a boy, which when combined with the name is a somewhat perverse juxtaposition to say the least.\n\nBut my favorite kid in the movie is &quot;Butterball&quot;, the requisite fat kid who comes equipped with a battery of fat kid jokes and steals the whole show: Every time the camera includes his pudgy face he is gobbling food of some sort, his favorite snack being butter sandwiches with extra butter that he carries around in his pockets. He also farts a lot, creating a running joke as he belts out a blast of gas whenever trying to cram his porky hide into a tight squeeze or jump energetically from the kids&apos; wagon. He is probably the film&apos;s direct link to BAD NEWS BEARS, which also had a fat kid who was always eating chocolate bars whenever on screen. I wonder if it&apos;s writers saw KID TERROR and were inspired, since Butterball&apos;s point in the story is to remind viewers that fat kids are constantly gobbling food like greedy slobs &amp; need to pass gas as a result of their gluttony. Especially if they eat lots of big sloppy butter sandwiches. Eww.\n\nLike other films of this kind (see DEVIL TIMES FIVE for a creepy sadistic twist on the formula) the kids are brighter, smarter, more clever and more heroic compared to the adults in the film, all of whom are either swindlers or victims being manipulated by the film&apos;s villain. The kids even manage to teach the town sheriff a lesson about not judging others based on their size or age, and of course win the day in the end for their oppressed parents. Their leader is also as clever as MacGuyver, at one point employing one of Butterball&apos;s spare butter sandwiches (&quot;I was saving that for an emergency!&quot;) and some handy gunpowder to rig a bomb. All of it leads up to a big complex final showdown scene where the kids take on the gang of crooks with their slingshots, bows &amp; arrows, buckets of horse manure and kickboxing skills (??).\n\nWhich leads me to my conclusion about this film, which is that it is one of the more successful efforts from the later period of Italian made Spaghetti Westerns (1970 - 1976 or so) to inject some life into the by then passé form by mixing genre formulae. This one blends clever kids with kung-fu action and a caper formula, eschewing the tired &quot;vengeance for murdering my brother and sending me to prison for 15 years&quot; assembly line plotting that makes most Spaghetti&apos;s sort of blend together in their sameness. By contrast KID TERROR is still (35 years later) refreshingly different, cleverly written, inappropriately hilarious, filled with some wonderful crude humor, and in supremely poor taste for a movie filled with kids. I approve!!\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Last Valley, a serious historical and sociological drama, is just about the only English language feature film to deal with the Thirty Years War. It&apos;s about a valley that because of its inaccessibility escapes some of the ravages of that very brutal conflict.\n\n17th century Europe was the century of the great religious conflicts between Catholic and the many Protestant faiths. The Catholic Hapsburg Holy Roman Empire was gradually losing its grip on more and more of the various little domains that made up their empire. More rulers and the populations of those small kingdoms were converting to either Lutheranism or Calvinism. \n\nOf course the rest of Europe was concerned as to who would come out on top and from 1617 when the conflict first started, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, France, Spain, just about everybody got involved one way or another. Religion was the key factor, but hardly the only one. France because her prime minister Cardinal Richelieu feared the Hapsburgs more than Protestantism allied themselves with the Protestant rulers.\n\nThe war itself was fought mostly in Germany, not Germany the nation, but Germany the geographical expression, just a place where the German language predominated. The German people, weak and disunited, were just prey for the other invading powers.\n\nThe looting and pillaging you see here is exactly what was going on in 1641 when scholar Omar Sharif who had lost his entire family and home to the war is now reduced to being a wandering beggar and stumbles into this valley which has escaped the struggle. Unfortunately following him in is Michael Caine with a company of mercenaries. \n\nBut Sharif talks Caine into doing winter quarters there instead of just sacking the place and moving on as per the norm for the day. An uneasy alliance is formed between, Sharif, Caine and his soldiers, head honcho in the town Nigel Davenport and priest Per Oscarsson.\n\nThe peasants here are hardly a noble lot, Sharif&apos;s very education makes him a figure of suspicion. Yet they&apos;re just ordinary folks trying to survive in a world that they must think is coming to an end. It would have not been out of the ordinary for them to believe that what they were seeing was Armegeddon. \n\nThe Thirty Years War is not something that is taught in American schools. I think because the United Kingdom was not involved in it. they had a nice struggle going between the crown and Parliament in the first half of that century and what became the original thirteen colonies of America were all being settled by various immigrant groups. The Last Valley is a tremendous educational tool for anyone teaching European history. We don&apos;t see any of the great figures of the war, what we do see is a glimpse into the peasant life of the period that once seen is unforgettable.\n\nJames Clavell who later wrote and directed Oriental epics like Shogun and Taipan wrote and directed The Last Valley. He and the rest of the cast and crew should be proud of being involved in a cinema masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Fudoh&apos; shows was based on a manga and it shows. The aesthetic of violence sprinkled with zany moments and some very otaku specific weird elements make that very clear. But it is still a self sufficient movie and a very unique one at that. It launched Miike as an extravagant director of great caliber.\n\nThe cult appeal assures it something a niche place in exploitation and revenge cinema. Plot-wise &apos;Fudoh&apos; is about the relentless pursuit of vengeance that justifies the buckets of blood, the child assassins, the vagina darts (it makes sense, even) and other diverse methods of killing. But it is also a story of personal charisma and a family drama. Miike&apos;s dark humor makes a few striking appearances such as when a half Korean character goes into a fit over kimchi prepared in Japanese style.\n\nThe full title points to a generational conflict and indeed &apos;Fudoh&apos; is something of a rebellion against adults and their degenerate ways, a topic that manga/anime often insist on. But there is no bright eyed youthful idealism here. Riki and his companions are fully conscious that to carry out their plans they need leave a trail of blood on their wake. The hyper violence for which Miike is so well known is already fully articulated in this movie and it reaches levels of stylistic prowess in a few sequences, namely the shoot out at the beginning.\n\nAbove all &apos;Fudoh&apos; is entertaining. Fans of extreme cinema cannot fail to appreciate it and in hindsight it is very curious given the predominance that Miike achieved with his career. As a movie that points to later developments it has a redoubled interest."

Well depicted also his emotional life with her lover Petacci - which probably he exploited to the end for her devotion and total love. I was sorry that the story of the documents he was carrying with him, with all the letters exchanged with Churchill - and that would compromise Churchill if brought to the public - was totally ignored - probably too delicate a topic to be dealt with in this kind of commercial movies.",

Which is no doubt what the director would like me to do: see all the strange goings on she&apos;s – deliberately – not been showing. And also reading into the narrative all the story she&apos;s not been developing, or even really providing. The new receptionist Irene never says very much; and the other characters don&apos;t say much to her either. Is something &quot;funny&quot; going to happen to her? Hopefully yes – otherwise watching this film will have felt like a waste of time.\n\nCome the end something funny does happen to her. But it still felt like a waste of time. There&apos;s been too much concealed as opposed to revealed or released dramatic tension. The direction far too mutedly mannered. Far too withheld.",

Whereas Fellini -- through Mastroianni -- seems to comment his own shortfalls as an artist and his faustian, sexual desire with a mischievous, but upbeat wink in the end, the narrator&apos;s final epigramm as well as the title of Welles&apos; last movie seems to suggest a more macbethian philosophy: it was all a story full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, and the acclaimed director is nothing but the other side of the wind, blowing in a conversation."

After enduring the usual hazing rituals she hooks up with two more popular girls and goes off for a weekend in London where all three fall prey to a cabal of sleazy pornographers (led by Jess Franco regular Jack Taylor). This movie starts out as a a fairly serious and realistic movie, but quickly goes off the rails into the soapiest melodrama imaginable. The pornography plot is not only highly hypocritical given how exploitative THIS movie is, but also pretty damn ludicrous: why would pornographers go to such ridiculous lengths to surreptitiously and illegally photograph barely underaged schoolgirls when all they would have had to do was hire girls a couple years older and have them pretend (which is basically what this movie itself did)? On the other hand though, the movie doesn&apos;t really revel in its own absurdity by, say, going into giallo territory with a lot of bloody murders (a la one of its obvious models &quot;What Have You Done to Solange?&quot;), but remains a staid and rather dull melodrama (at least, aside from one potentially offensive interracial rape scene).\n\nThe main attraction here is Koo Stark, who was the first love of Britain&apos;s Prince Andrew, but was pushed aside because she wasn&apos;t a buck-toothed, inbred hillbilly blue-blood like Sarah Ferguson (and because she appeared in movies like this). She is very appealing here and quite good despite having to spend most of the movie as a repressed, bookish schoolgirl with thick glasses and a dubbed Spanish accent. Spanish actress, Cristina Galbo, from &quot;Solange?&quot;, also has a very small (and completely superfluous) role, but naturally, like all the girls in this movie, she is on screen long enough to take her clothes off.\n\nThey certainly don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore in this age of starchy political correctness and &quot;social responsibility&quot; and that in itself may be reason to see this ridiculous, sleazy, and hypocritical piece of 70&apos;s exploitation."

      "reviewBody": "After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with &quot;Human Nature&quot;, Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn&apos;t go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.\n\n&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn&apos;t recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel&apos;s distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.\n\nIf anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.\n\nKaufman&apos;s story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman&apos;s trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;. Gondry&apos;s diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.\n\nThe sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.\n\nThis is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It&apos;s one of those films you&apos;ll want to see twice.",

Rejected by the small village due to his dark skin, Paw finds himself in the care of a lonely woodsman, Anders, after his aunt dies. Anders, who lives a secluded life with a tragic past, becomes an unlikely guardian. His actions, like poaching and offering Paw cognac, set questionable examples. Eventually, Paw is placed in an institution but runs away to build a forest home. When discovered, he is allowed to return to Anders, with hope that the villagers will eventually accept him.\n\nBased on a Torry Gredsted novel, the film primarily focuses on the villagers&apos; racist attitudes towards Paw. Appearing superficially like a Disney family drama, BOY OF TWO WORLDS is instead a serious examination of race relations. It was released in Denmark in 1959 and in the US in 1970.",

WOW.\n\nFuturistic story, great character design, animation quality with attention to foreground and background, interesting plot with action, adventure, relationships, philosophy and more. Glad there were subtitles. \n\nMade me want to go back to Belgrade (was there in 1970) and shake the creator&apos;s hand. The work of one person ... amazing.

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who&apos;s read the original manga or, er, &apos;witnessed&apos; the anime may question the wisdom of a live-action remake, what with all the slightly extravagant fisticuffs involved. But don&apos;t worry: it hasn&apos;t been turned into a blood-free pacifism-fest with Kenshiro strutting around in sandals and a tweed waistcoat preaching the ways of non-violent protest to the post-holocaust plebs. Oh no. There&apos;s plenty of fights in here, mate. And some of them are even quite entertaining.\n\nThere have been concessions to your average action film punter who&apos;s probably never even heard of the original, however. The storyline has been simplified (in the sense of at least one major character being dropped and a couple of others rolled into one) and a more familiar Hollywood flavour given to the future wasteland scenario, so that the whole thing occasionally teeters on the brink of suddenly turning into Mad Max II. But it doesn&apos;t, so that&apos;s alright. It manages to stick to the basic story thread of one bloke being the Fist of the North Star, another bloke being the Master of Southern Cross and &apos;the teachings&apos; apparently dictating that the two must never fight... for a while, anyway, then it happily bins this ridiculous idea and gets everyone in to have a good old-fashioned scrap. So it&apos;s all pretty straightforward at the end of the day.\n\nStraight-to-video martial arts ponce Gary Daniels does somehow look the part as Kenshiro, and as his Aussie twang isn&apos;t called into play too frequently you don&apos;t keep expecting Home And Away&apos;s Alf Stewart to turn up with chins retracted and demand that &quot;You get out of my store, young Ken.&quot; His nemesis, Shin, is played by some other even less famous bloke, while Reservoir Dogs&apos; Chris Penn gets to be another nutter and the unavoidable Malcolm McDowell chips in a deeply strenuous performance as a bloke who gets killed in the first five minutes. Apart from that it&apos;s a cast of nobodies. Spot the irony.\n\nBut despite offering nothing spectacular or stunningly innovative to the world, Fist isn&apos;t as bad as it could have been. It&apos;s definitely a bit shaky all round, yes, but the exploding heads and bursting arteries are fairly well done and that&apos;s all any version of the story ever had going for it really, so at least you can&apos;t complain about the budget being spent in all the wrong places."

      "reviewBody": "Soviet cinema (and other art forms) spent 70 years mythologising the Russian Civil War of 1918-1921, with special attention paid to creating Bolshevik heroes (galore) and demonising their opponents (of all stripes). The cinematically tiresome and historically ludicrous results are still showing on Russian television, and will likely be for decades-- which makes one wonder what children growing up without ever having known the Soviet Union can possibly make of them. Why, they must ask themselves, are the Bolsheviks still heroes on TV when we know they weren&apos;t in history? \n\nA film like Gospoda Ofitsery: Spasti Imperatora (Officers and Gentlemen: To Save the Emporer) makes a modest contribution toward redressing the balance. It&apos;s far from great cinema; it is, instead, cinema that tries hard, if you will, to entertain and de-ideologise at the same go. Here and there it succeeds. It clearly had a respectable budget and some moderately well-known actors, plus a special effects unit that could do a creditable job with battles scenes and explosives.\n\nThe plot involves a commando group of officers detailed to save the lives of the imprisoned Romanov family. There are several sequences which tell a good story in themselves, but the whole of the film is really not impressive or sustained movie-making. Briefly put, the signal virtue of this production is its point of view: the heroes are the actual good guys and the villains the actual bad guys. And in the context of Russian history-as-presented-in-the-cinema, that counts for a good deal.\n\nOne hopes that another Russian Civil War blockbuster, &quot;Kolchak&quot; -- due to be released shortly -- can add rather more to this step in the right direction.",

      "name": "A Triumph",
      "reviewBody": "Sometimes (even oftentimes) in the world of film criticism, the word &quot;triumphant&quot; is thrown around. It&apos;s often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. I&apos;ve certainly used it; it&apos;s a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it&apos;s more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel I&apos;ve never used &quot;triumphant&quot; in the correct critical context before.\n\nJames Franco&apos;s performance is simply astounding. He, as an actor, is triumphant because his character is, and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role - Franco is basically putting on a one-man show, and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralston&apos;s pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face, verbalizes it with every sigh, and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.\n\nIt&apos;s pure, masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder, much of his performance lies in his facial expressions, and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive, all while being barely able to move. I&apos;ve rarely been so impressed by an actor&apos;s work; Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.\n\nDanny Boyle&apos;s kinetic, energetic direction is a perfect match for Franco&apos;s easy-going goofiness, and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped, Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and co-writer Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralston&apos;s dilemma to great, heart-breaking effect, and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive whole-heartedly into amputating his own arm is breath-taking in its tenderness.\n\nAlso impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle&apos;s cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques, they tackle every possible angle, often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralston&apos;s water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home movie-style footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience; when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family, you&apos;ll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. It&apos;s a great device, and is put to best use in one of the film&apos;s funniest scenes, when Ralston interviews himself Gollum-style. The combination of the dark humor, varied cinematography, and Franco&apos;s impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly; it&apos;s a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.\n\nComplementing and combining Chediak and Mantle&apos;s beautiful shots is Jon Harris&apos;s dynamic editing. The use of split-screen is particularly brilliant, put to use in innovative ways throughout the film: the bookend sequences mark Ralston&apos;s departure from and return to society, and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes, when it comes down to it, 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But it&apos;s so much more than that. It&apos;s about a man overcoming the physical, emotional, and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. It&apos;s about responsibility, love, and the will to live. Above all, it&apos;s about the triumph of the human spirit, show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.",

      "name": "Very good S.W. about a relentless and exciting manhunt set against spectacular scenery of Almeria",
      "reviewBody": "This is the original installment from Cuchillo trilogy and again an awesome Tomas Milian . This is the first part from Sergio Sollima trilogy, starred by Tomas Milian, as the roguish Cuchillo and formed by ¨Face to face¨ with Gian Maria Volonte and ¨Run Cuchillo run ¨ with Donald O&apos;Brien and this one . It deals with Jonathan Corbett , a real-life character well played by Lee Van Cleef , who pursues a Mexican bandit accused of rape and murder . The solitary , self-reliant Corbett tracks down Cuchillo who is wrongly accused of killing . The relentless chase is set against strong environment , risked mountains and hazardous trails. Later on , the dangerous pursuit includes a motley posse formed by Walter Barnes, Angel Del Pozo , Gerard Herter , among others . Now as absolute starring Tomas Milian , nicknamed Cuchillo , and supported by Lee Van Cleef as an obstinate pursuer . It will be a long and dangerous pursuit with continuous getaways . It&apos;s set during early Mexican revolution with Benito Juarez ruling . And the Cuban Thomas Milian, as usual, puts faces, grimaces, crying and overacting, but plays splendidly.\n\nThis Zapata-Western is superior than subsequent entries because it displays stirring adventures, shootouts, riding pursuits and is pretty amusing. It&apos;s an exciting S. W. with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Lee Van Cleef , Tomas Milian and the nasty enemies as Walter Barnes and his hoodlums as Angel Del Pozo and the German officer Gerard Herter . Tomas Milian is very fine, he ravages the screen, he jumps, hit and run , besides receiving violent punches, kicks and wounds . Gerard Herter playing a cruelly baddie role as Prussian baron with monocle is terrific , subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis . Furthermore, it appears usual secondaries of Italian/Spanish Western as the femme fatal Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott as a black widow , in addition a lot of familiar paella faces as Robert Camardiel ,Lorenzo Robledo, Luis Barboo , Fernando Bilbao, Barta Barry , Frank Braña and , of course, Fernando Sancho in his ordinary role as a bully Mexican . The film blends violence, blood, tension , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing shootouts or stunts every few minutes. There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by Carlo Simi , Sergio Leone&apos;s usual , he creates a magnificent scenario with barren outdoors, dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine set on the final scenes . As always , the musician Ennio Morricone, composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted ; it&apos;s full of guttural sounds and emotive score . Interior filmed at Elios Studios and outdoor sequences filmed at Tabernas , Cinecitta Studios , Rome and of course Almeria, Spain.\n\nSergio Sollima&apos;s direction is well crafted, here he&apos;s less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and too much action. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlo Carlini , reflecting marvelously the habitual Almeria outdoors . The picture was well directed by Sollima , it would be his last Western and following directing successes such as Pirate films as ¨ Sandokan ¨ and the ¨Black Corsario¨ . Rating : Better than average Western . Essential and indispensable watching for Spaghetti Western aficionados .",

      "reviewBody": "Houdini was once approached by a student who told him, &quot;I know hundreds of card tricks, how many do you know?&quot; Houdini replied, &quot;Five, and I have dedicated my entire life to learning how to entertain an audience with them&quot;.\n\nBuck Howard is a dried up celebrity struggling for his last gasp of fame. Almost forty years ago, Johnny Carson gave Buck Howard the title &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; and it stuck. Unfortunately, those years have left their mark and Buck is no longer &apos;Great&apos;. Despite his tired jokes, sappy piano clap-along songs and magic acts he manages to attract small crowds at far-flung venues in the middle of America. The performances are always &quot;One Night Only&quot;, as there would never be enough seat-fillers for a second. So what is exactly that keeps him going?\n\nColin Hanks plays Troy Gable, a law school dropout looking for a detour to finally get the answer to what he is meant to do in life. Will be able to counsel him a unbalanced magician -or mentalist-?\n\nNicely done, this film is funny and likable. A modern story about life dreams, the fierce entertainment industry, and the sadness that hides behind a bad temperamental person. Every well-known actor that appears in this film,even if they play short cameo roles, plays an important part.\n\nIt&apos;s quite a gentle, unusual comedy, so morals behind this movie are hard to get. However, this is a good film worth watching and definitely should be shown as an example of outstanding acting from Malkovich to Star Trek actor George Takei.",

After having read reviews that claimed it to be a rip off of &quot;Alien&quot;, then I was a bit reluctant to watch it. I will say, however, that while it shares some similarities with &quot;Alien&quot; then it wasn&apos;t a rip off.\n\nThe story is about a group of interplanar archaeologists who stumble upon a cave-dwelling alien creature. The creature impregnates one of the crew members, and slowly she started to turn into a crazed killer while the alien offspring grows inside her.\n\nNow, the movie is driven by its story and acting talents, and barely relying on the special effects. This wasn&apos;t a special effects extravaganza, not by a long shot.\n\nAs for the acting, then I will say that people were doing good jobs all round, which was crucial for the movie.\n\nYou can&apos;t really have an alien creature movie without a proper alien being. The alien in &quot;Inseminoid&quot; actually looked rather interesting and was nicely made. It just wasn&apos;t shown as much throughout the entire movie as I would have liked.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Inseminoid&quot; is an enjoyable Sci-Fi horror movie. But given its age, it is not a movie that stands out as memorable in comparison to the Sci-Fi horror movies that come out nowadays.",

Maybe they had a good idea, but that never surfaces. The film just moves from A to B. A good director could have made it into a passable film, director Von Ambesser seemed to have been glad he was able to shoot more or less adequately each scene. It is as with the first Rühmann as Father Brown film (Das schwarze Schaf 1960): it may look all very English, but it desperately lacks the charm of Chesterton&apos;s stories.(5/10)",

But if that sounds like a familiar formula, don&apos;t be fooled. This is quite unlike any other film you will see this year.\n\nThe dogs, of course, steal the show. You probably need to be a dog-lover (as I am) to enjoy it properly - but I would stick my neck out and say that non dog-lovers should also see it. What is extraordinary is that, as you watch the huskies inter-act with each other, you actually understand what is going through their minds - and yet very rarely does the director slip over into the trap of &apos;humanising&apos; their emotions. It would have been very easy to make this like an overly &apos;cute&apos; kind of Disney movie, but that trap is avoided. The film is perhaps a little too sentimental at times, but not once do you expect the dogs to start talking! \n\nAs for the humans, Paul Walker is developing into a very good movie actor, and Jason Biggs is always good fun on screen. The film is as much about human loss, fears and emotions as it is about canine intelligence. It also tells you a thing or two about what life is like in a remote Antarctic outpost.\n\nI&apos;d certainly recommend this movie to anyone searching out a couple of hours worth of entertainment. Oh, and there is one moment in the film which is genuinely terrifying: it&apos;ll make you jump out of your skin. I&apos;ll say no more about that except you&apos;ll know it when you see it (You have been warned!)",

In my opinion there is still a lot of mileage to be gotten out of &quot;teens in the woods encounter evil possessed killer&quot; plots. But this thing is just such a mess! Other people have blamed the actors, the costumer, the director, the scriptwriter. I&apos;ll take a new approach and blame the editor. I see an outside possibility that the script was coherent, but that the editor rendered it into an incoherent mess.\n\nThe truth is, after watching the riffed version five times, I still don&apos;t quite understand what was going on in the movie. The &quot;rules&quot; of fantasy and horror don&apos;t need to make real-world sense, but these rules have to be explained clearly, and then stuck to, and make internal sense. The filmmakers failed at all this.\n\nThere is a lot to laugh at here. The wolf attack that did not include a wolf, the terrible acting of the &quot;novelist,&quot; the assumption that college students play a lot of hide and seek and truth or dare still, the non- Indian, and everyone mispronouncing the word &quot;wolf.&quot;\n\nPoor Corey Haim. Being molested as a kid actor by producers, his drug addiction, and this movie. There must be a special place in the afterlife for someone who suffered that much.",

      "name": "My Favourite Movie",
      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a scene in Sion Sono&apos;s magnum opus Love Exposure, in which the emotionally abused and alienated protagonist, Yu, feeling fed up, screams and runs out into the night rain, still wearing his school uniform. He comes across some shady-looking teenagers trying to shake some free food out of a vending machine, and without hesitating, runs up and joins in their attack of the snack dispenser. They stop, then he stops, and they all look at each other for a second, and then resume, pushing over the vending machine, at which point a security guard calls out and they all run away together... And just like that these guys become Yu&apos;s new amazing friends who turn his whole life around.\n\nIt was at this moment that I fell in love with Love Exposure - I felt connected to Yu, to his feeling of suffocation in his home life, and then to see him suddenly drop his inhibitions, and change his life, in an instant, in the most ridiculous and audacious way imaginable... It got me excited, motivated; it made me feel pumped up. Well, if Love Exposure is, rightly, seen as the summation of every movie Sono had made up until Love Exposure, Hazard is the film in Sono&apos;s filmography that metamorphosed into that scene; in a way it&apos;s a complete film about Yu and his friends - that whole aspect of Love Exposure.\n\nHazard is a film about a college student, Shin, who feels suffocated by his dull life, trapped by his surroundings. He is sick to death of &quot;sleepy but restless&quot; Japan, and wants to go somewhere that&apos;s alive; when he happens to read about high crime rates in New York City, he is actually attracted by this idea of danger (of &quot;Hazard&quot;), and decides to leave everything behind and go. Once in New York, he sort of wanders aimlessly for a while, failing to fit in and managing only to get himself mugged, until one day he meets a couple charismatic Japanese guys his age in a convenience store. A minute later, these guys pull out some guns, rob the convenience store (of a few snacks only), and the three run away together. Shin is invited to live with these new best friends of his, and together, they make New York their &quot;paradise&quot;.\n\nI&apos;ve often felt that Sono&apos;s films are not &quot;realistic&quot;, but hyper-real; the scenarios are exaggerated and he works on an emotionally elevated level, but underlying that exaggeration is something deeply relatable, and through that exaggeration he conveys this in a much stronger way. So, taking this convenience store scene for example, well, it&apos;s the same as that scene in Love Exposure: seeing this character, who I relate to, have his life turned around in the most insane way... It&apos;s exciting; it pumps me up, and even inspires me to be more bold in my own life.\n\nI don&apos;t take it literally - I&apos;m not about to hold up a convenience store - but I never got the sense that the violence in Hazard was ever meant to be taken literally. In real life, I&apos;ve never even seen a gun up close; there&apos;s nothing particularly relatable to me about violence or crime, yet these are completely ubiquitous, practically obligatory elements of entertaining cinema. I see the guns and violence in Hazard then as sort of a way of Sono subverting the traditional form of an urban crime film, to create a movie that has the same entertainment value, but beneath the surface is really a film about friendship, and a marginalized youth finding his place in the world.\n\nThe last time I watched Hazard now, was almost a year and a half ago. It is the one movie I took the time to watch while I was in Tokyo. My trip to Tokyo was in part inspired by Hazard, actually. Yes, Shin wanted to get away from &quot;sleepy but restless&quot; Japan, but I don&apos;t think the film is a commentary on any specific place or nationality - and I think the ending reinforces this - it&apos;s a universal film about a youth, desiring to experience life someplace else, and taking back out of this experience a revitalized outlook on life. For me, having never left the country, I was completely fed up with Canada, a country that&apos;s not &quot;restless&quot;, but rather, just always asleep, and Tokyo was a place that had the same alluring sense of otherness to it, that maybe New York had for Shin.\n\nLike Shin, I went alone. I wasn&apos;t interested in tourism - I wanted to know what it was like to actually live in Tokyo. I stayed for a month. I went out every day and every evening, to explore different parts of the city. Like Shin, I wandered aimlessly. Sometimes I would get lost and it would take me hours to find my way back to the nearest train station. I took language classes while I was there, and met some people through that, but mostly I remained on my own. I spent countless nights just hanging out around fairs and convenience stores, or around the smokers at Hachiko Square in Shibuya, watching the lights and the people. I felt lonely and discouraged one night and that&apos;s when I decided to watch Hazard. Feeling inspired again by the movie, I ran back out to the train station to continue exploring the city (though it&apos;s interesting how that &quot;pumped up&quot; feeling I leave a Sono film with can be hard to hold onto while waiting for a train with a handful of bored-looking people). When I returned that night, I met a Taiwanese guy staying in the same guesthouse as me, who recognized me from the language school, and (even though our only mutual language was extremely broken Japanese) I finally made a substantial friendship there.\n\nA couple weeks after coming home from Japan, I returned to college, and, finally reunited with my old friends (after an 8-month co-op/break), we drank and ran through the snowy night streets, as the scene from Hazard of Shin, running through the street with Lee and Takeda flashed in my head. Well, that&apos;s what Hazard means to me. I absolutely love those characters. Lee is amazing - his total lack of inhibitions and sheer ecstasy of existence (Jai West&apos;s performance is unbelievable), the way he takes Shin under his arms... And Shin... Never have I felt more connected to a film character than him, the &quot;boy who only wanted to fly&quot;. Sion Sono has said he would like to see his movies &quot;have the power to change people&apos;s lives for the better&quot;. Well, I certainly think that power is in Hazard, for me, as it continues to inspire me to be a little less bashful around people, and to strive towards finding my own &quot;paradise&quot;, like they make for each other in the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Nothing surprising is revealed in this documentary.  Perhaps ten years ago, when the film came out, it stunned many fans and non-fans.  But Madonna has remained in the spotlight ever since, and thanks to magazines, interviews, MTV, VH-1, not to mention her music, video, book and film work since 1991, we&apos;ve seen most of the stuff in this documentary already.  Plus, Madonna shows us only what she wants us to see.  There are a few moments when the camera suddenly shuts off, like when she confesses that Sean Penn was the love of her life.  She also talks about her huge crush on Antonio Banderas, and when he snubs her, she jokingly admits that she will never work with him (obviously she was kidding because she worked with him in Evita).  When she&apos;s playful and in good spirits, she&apos;s fun to watch.  But in the end, this is really a vanity project, instead of the completely &quot;naked&quot; documentary it was supposed to be.  That probably suits her diehard fans just fine, but regular viewers are hoping to see more than her &quot;attitude&quot; backstage, long footage of her explicit onstage material, constant vulgarity, and high-maintenance daily rituals."

In my opinion they do not make the story less realistic.But the heart of the movie is good. Good and evil isn&apos;t portrayed as black and white. We see two rival clans, but both have their motives to fight for the survival of their people, which means suffering for the opponents. The movie makes some unexpected twists that makes it more interesting on a personal level In the end it&apos;s about obsession, possession versus love. Whatever you gain, brings others in disadvantage. This is the most important message I saw in this movie. A beautiful Korean fantasy story.",

On the contrary, Bradley is better in the fighting scenes, which (as always) makes up an important part in the movie. The problem is that Michael Dudikoff and Steve James had a special chemistry between themselves that now is gone. But it was a relief finding out that James was in this movie.

It should definitely be considered an American classic.\n\nThe movie is a docu-drama based on the few years in the life of Junior Johnson, a famous stock car racer. A young Jeff Bridges brings the main character to life with a great performance, inspired and entertaining. The supporting cast is also excellent with Gary Busey as the brother and Valerie Perrine as the love interest.\n\nAll the elements of a great movie that time forgot: thrilling racing scenes, three-dimensional characters, humor, a complicated plot, and so on.. It&apos;s a shame that action movies today don&apos;t sacrifice some of the explosions, blood, and high-tech props for the type of entertainment and engrossment that Last American Hero delivers.",

      "reviewBody": "Maestro, Michele Massimo Tarantini&apos;s flint-edged &apos;Poliziotti violenti&apos; aka &apos;Crimebusters&apos; (1976) is a terrifically entertaining Poliziottesco from the largely unheralded director of the no less exhilarating, &apos;A Man Called Magnum&apos; &amp; &apos;7 Hours of Violence&apos;. This enjoyably boisterous Euro-crime includes the splendidly stone-faced Henry Silva, charismatically delivering yet another Stoic, sinisterly simmering performance as the honourably straight-shooting, Maj. Paolo Altieri. Incensed by army corruption and the increasingly brutal machinations of the criminal underworld, Altieri is fatefully driven to acts of extreme retribution, and soon, wherever the militantly macho Major ventures, a bloody swathe of cathartic ultra-violence is sure to follow!\n\nSwarthy cinematic stud, Antonio Sabato is well cast as the sharp-witted, belligerent Police commissioner, Paolo Tosi, whose fearsome propensity for twin-fisted justice is put to efficient use in Tarantini&apos;s enjoyably rough-hewn poliziottesco potboiler, and, rewardingly, the dynamic filmmaker constructs a number of compelling action scenes. The vehicular calamity, ear-shattering gun play and equally pugnacious punch-ups ensure that, Michele Tarantini&apos;s rumbustious, pleasingly action-packed actioner remains a shrapnel savage Poliziotteschi that most certainly merits a larger audience among Euro-cult fans. For me, one of &apos;Crimebusters&apos; most enduring qualities is the robustly propulsive crime-jazz score by thrilling Euro-crime maestros, Guido &amp; Maurizio de Angelis.",

      "reviewBody": "Not wanting to be left out of the giant bug craze that was infesting American theatres, British film makers conjured up &quot;The Strange World of Planet X&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Cosmic Monsters&quot;) in which scientists messing with magnetic fields disrupt the ionosphere and allow cosmic rays to penetrate to the Earth&apos;s surface with deadly results. Taking a page from &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), a messenger from the stars, complete with Klingonesque mustachios, arrives to warn us of our impending doom if we keep messing around with the unmessable. True to his prediction, the cosmic radiation generates voraciously hungry giant bugs as well as turns the local ne&apos;er-do-well into murderous lunatic. It&apos;s up to heroic scientist Gil Graham (Forrest Tucker of &quot;F Troop&quot; fame) to stop obsessive scientist Dr. Laird (Alec Mango) before he destroys the world. The movie features great misogynic wisecracks about women scientists for viewers who delight in taking offence at such things, the typically high-quality acting one associates with British accents (Tucker, playing a Canadian is OK as well), and a cerebral, if plodding, story. Unfortunately the special effects are pretty limp - mostly macroshots of insects, worms etc (with a salamander thrown in for good measure) back-dropping a superimposed screaming or fainting woman (unexpectedly, there is one grim shot of a soldier getting his face eaten that is pretty good). The ending, although not spectacular, is satisfying although no mention is made of the massive outbreak of cancers that the National Health should expecting in the area over the next couple of decades. The movie is somewhat smarter that its American contemporaries (&apos;The Deadly Mantis&apos;, &apos;The Black Scorpion&apos;, &apos;Tarantula&apos;, &apos;Them&apos;, etc) but not nearly as entertaining.",

I really appreciate and like that he has joined Hollywood. Keep it up. UR a handsome man and a very good actor thus u have all the rights to be an actor and the audience would love to see u in some different roles than u have been doing lately.This movie targeted youngsters. I hope you are gonna make some more movies targeting the middle aged people and with a totally different role though your look rocks. Best of luck to U and your wife for this movie and for the future.",

      "reviewBody": "Wong Fei-hung as a young man has a reputation different from that awaiting him as an adult. With a nickname of Naughty Panther, Fei-hung is in constant trouble with people and, no matter his intentions to help out just makes things worse for himself. When his father has had enough he sends Fei-hung away to be trained by a wine-guzzling master Su who is not only famed for his 8-Drunken Genii style but also for crippling many of his students. Fei-hung tries to get away from this fate but it is not long till his drunken teacher tracks him down and teaches him, whether he likes it or not. However, when he is humbled by the mighty killer Thunderleg, he decides to train to be better no matter what it takes.\n\nI&apos;ve not given up on modern releases totally but a real death-march of uninspiring films of late has seen me using my DVD rental subscription to get in touch with older films and also genres that do not often show up on my basic TV package. Recently this has seen me getting some old-school martial arts films and of course Drunken Master had to be one of the first to be seen. When watching it, it is important that you keep your genre frame of reference because as a &quot;film&quot; (with no riders or expectations) it could be dismissed as having no substance to speak of - an accusation that I myself level at many blockbusters that offer me nothing to engage with. In this case though one does have to wonder if it matters because in terms of pure entertainment value there is just about sufficient story to pull a basic frame together for an amusing and exciting film.\n\nI say this because the plot doesn&apos;t do much other than set up the many fight sequences that the film has and really these are the reason why we are all here. Without exception, these are technically and visually impressive. The physical strength and control of the actors is just as impressive as the choreography and, unlike modern films, the camera sits back so we can see and doesn&apos;t get into the close and frantic editing which reveal the actor perhaps could only do one short movement at a time and needed lots of help from the camera. Speaking of camera movement, one of the joys of the film is to see what has now become the genre-defining zooms in on faces and other such clichés.\n\nSpeaking of which, the acting also fits this mould as it is the wonderful OTT style of acting, with big hair and exaggerated performances that owe a debt to silent cinema. Chan is not at his funniest here (partly because his character necessitates a degree of arrogance that takes away a little) but he is still very comic and self-effacing in his comedy. He is well supported by Yuen, who is also very skilled and able to do comedy, while Hwang&apos;s villain is wonderfully 1970&apos;s martial arts and full of camp menace. The support cast features some familiar faces who bring stuff to the table such as the high-kicking Linda Lin and the amusing Dean Shek.\n\nDrunken Master is very much a genre film and those who do not like the conventions of the genre should not be too shocked to find that they don&apos;t like it here. However for martial arts fans and the casual viewer, this is a great film with plenty of brilliant action blended with a genial and comic tone that allows it to be solid good fun."

      "reviewBody": "Steve Martin&apos;s entertaining vehicle with young people and agreeable actors . The film deals about a happy family , the father (Steve Martin) is a notorious coach and the mother (Bonnie Hunt) is a writer and with twelve sons (Tom Welling, Piper Perabo, Hilary Duff..) . In the first part dealt with Tom who received a new offer as a trainer of a famous football team and she obtained her dream for the publishing the book titled : ¨Cheaper by the dozen¨. With the new job , they had to change from a small city to the big town . This second installment is set two years after the events in the previous film concerns The Bakers, this time the Baker family begins to undergo many changes, starting with Lorraine (Hilary Duff) and her desire to study in New York. Their oldest daughter Nora (Piper Perabo) is now married to Bud McNulty (Jonathan Bennett) and heavily pregnant. They intend to move to Houston because of Bud&apos;s new job promotion . While on vacation, find themselves competing with a rival family of eight children whose stiff father is Jimmy (Eugene Levy) , an old contender to Tom . Steve Martin ought to keep the familiar order involving in his own home while at the same time training the team to win the rival family . And along the way , the protagonist suffer numerous jokes and misfortunes in charge of the brothers . This Christmas The More... The Scarier! Growing pains? They&apos;ve got twelve of them!This Christmas, you better watch out! This Christmas You Better Watch Out! Same Big Family... Even Bigger Adventure.\n\nThe picture is pretty entertaining and amusing , the film contains bemusing scenes and continuous laughters and various chuckles with lots of fun . It&apos;s a new version of the classic film with similar title featured by Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy . Although this movie is loosely based on a book by that title &quot;Cheaper By The Dozen&quot; about a real-life family, the book was written by one of the sons, Frank B. Gilbreth Jr., along with his sister, Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. Although this film is based on that same book that inspired the 1950 film , the only element it retains from the original is the idea of there being 12 children in one family. Even the names of the characters are changed. The picture belongs to numerous family sub-genre whose maxim representation is ¨Yours , mine and ours¨ with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball and recently remade with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo . As trivia , to add the following one : when the &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; movies were made, neither Steve Martin nor Bonnie Hunt, who played the parents of 12 children, had ever had a child in real life . Based on the real life Gilbreth family, in fact the name Gilbreth appears sometimes throughout the film . As Gilbreth family on whom the film was based had 6 boys and 6 girls ; also, they did not have any twins . All the children were single births and the father regretted this because he felt multiple births to be more efficient . Steve Martin , as always , plays as excessive manner , making an authentic recital , if you like Martin&apos;s crazy interpretation , you&apos;ll enjoy this one . However , Tim Allen, Kurt Russell, Mel Gibson and Tom Hanks were considered for the role of Tom Baker. Besides , there appears as sons , known and young actors as Tom Welling (Smallville) , Hilary Duff (LizzyMcGuire) , Piper Perabo (Bar Coyote) and other kiddies as Taylor Lautner , Alyson Stoner , Jonathan Bennett, Jacob Smith , Liliana Mumy ,Morgan York , among others . The yarn was well realized , though without originality , and and with the same equipment was shot the first part . The motion picture was professionally directed by Adam Shankman : Hocus Pocus 2 , The pacifier, Rock of ages , Bedtime Stories , Wedding plans , Hairspray , A Walk to Remember. The flick will appeal to family films enthusiasts and Steve Martin fans.",

I&apos;d say this is my 4th favorite film ever after Fight Club, The Matrix, and True Romance. The floating wormholes is super cool to me and the soundtrack is so damn good!\n\nThought provoking films are my favorite ever, the fact that you could float on talking about different aspects and possibilities is beyond fascinating to me! It&apos;s extremely impressive that Richard Kelly was 26 when he wrote the script and made such a profound experience!",

I don&apos;t wish anyone the experience we had with a play he co-wrote with a brother and that was seen at the Mineta Lane Theater in New York about three years ago, in which the audience kept leaving the performance because it was insufferable. This same quality can be said about this adaptation of yet another one of his works for the theater.\n\nDirected by Tom Cairns, who also translated the material for the screen, shows us a couple of misfits that have been together far too long and would have been better off dissolving their marriage some time ago. The main attraction for watching the picture was Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick, both great actors that put in a brave appearance to be in front of the camera playing these people. One wonders why hasn&apos;t Marie left Bruce a long time before? It&apos;s easier to see why Bruce has stuck to the situation because he doesn&apos;t have much to offer anyone else in her right mind.\n\nThe film can infuriate would be viewers who would not have enough patience to sit right through it.",

      "reviewBody": "The Greatest Show on Earth is a Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza, maybe the best one he ever produced and directed. Unlike his religious films or his historical films, this film is a nice tribute to an American institution, the Ringling Brothers&amp;Barnum&amp;Bailey Circus and as such it does not attract the controversy of some of his other films.\n\nThe Best Picture Oscar for 1952 that this film won was more of a tribute to a Hollywood institution. Cecil B. DeMille in fact directed the first Hollywood made film, The Squaw Man, forty years earlier and this Oscar was essentially a tribute to him for the work of a lifetime. Not the first time or the last time the Motion Picture Academy has done that.\n\nThis is DeMille spectacle at it&apos;s best. The circus as a cinema subject, so full of color and life, is ideal for a DeMille production. Wonderful camera work marks this film, both of the circus acts and the reaction shots into the crowd of the children of all ages.\n\nCecil B. DeMille himself narrates portions of the film showing the work involved in putting on the Greatest Show on Earth. His was a familiar voice to the American public because for 10 years DeMille came into American households via radio narrating the Lux Radio Theater. In fact until Alfred Hitchcock got his own anthology TV series, DeMille&apos;s voice was probably the most known to the American public of a film director.\n\nAnd only his name and that of Walt Disney&apos;s of people behind the camera were guaranteed box office in the days of the Hollywood studio system.\n\nSpectacle was his thing and DeMille was the master. As a director of players and a judge of good modern writing, DeMille left a lot to be desired. Because of the nature of the subject, no great historical or religious events, the grandiloquent dialog present in so many DeMille films is kept to a minimum here.\n\nThis was Charlton Heston&apos;s first big break as a star and his second film under a Paramount contract. He had done a film called Dark City, a good noir thriller that got good reviews, but did little for him personally. DeMille saw the six foot two Heston walking on the Paramount lot one day and just said to himself that this was to be the circus ramrod for this film.\n\nBut Heston was fourth billed behind Betty Hutton, Cornel Wilde, and Gloria Grahame, all better known than him at the time. Wilde and Grahame were independents as was James Stewart who played a clown with a hidden past.\n\nStewart in fact had always wanted to play a clown and took this supporting role with smaller billing just for the opportunity. At the time he agreed to do this, his wife Gloria was pregnant with their twin daughters. Stewart had it in his contract a clause that gave him permission to leave the film temporarily to be with Gloria when her time was near. In fact Gloria McLean Stewart had a rough time with the birth and Jimmy exercised that option and totally enraged DeMille who had to shut down production for a few days. He and DeMille did not get along after that though Stewart finished the film and was great in it.\n\nGloria Grahame may not have been the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, but she was the most seductive operating in 1952. That was a banner year for her. She got a Best Supporting Actress for The Bad and the Beautiful on top of this DeMille film. As the elephant girl she attracts the unwanted attentions of Lyle Bettger who plays an elephant trainer.\n\nBettger was a great player at that time who played a lovely variety of psychopaths on the screen. He pulls out all the stops here and its his unwanted attentions to Grahame that set up the final scenes.\n\nDorothy Lamour was here also in a supporting part and she gets to sing Lovely Luawanna Lady in sarong and the reaction shots of the crowd focus on a couple of familiar faces who panted after her in a few Paramount films.\n\nThe story itself is a standard four sided triangle involving Heston, Hutton, Wilde, and Grahame with Bettger horning in. You have to see the film to find out who winds up with who.\n\nHowever the high point of the film involves a circus train wreck. DeMille got a lot of notice for wrecking a train in Union Pacific back in 1939. So he doubles the excitement and wrecks two trains here with circus animals pouring out of busted cages. Great stuff.\n\nBetty Hutton was coming close to the end of her film career. This and Annie Get Your Gun would be her biggest triumphs. Given DeMille&apos;s limitations on directing players, Hutton is surprisingly subdued here and effective. She also sings a couple of nice songs here as she bids adieu to Paramount in her next to last film for them.\n\nWhen The Greatest Show on Earth came out and was doing great box office, Charlton Heston related a story that DeMille came over to him on the Paramount lot and gave him a newspaper clipping and said he would never get a better notice ever, no matter how long a career he had. Heston read the thing and the critic from some small town paper praised all the actors like Stewart, Wilde, Hutton, Grahame, and Lamour said they were great, but that C.B. DeMille must be the greatest director in the world to get a performance out of that circus ramrod.\n\nFor all of DeMille&apos;s faults here, he created a circus picture that set the standard for any to follow.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie never fails to generate strong reactions, both positive and negative.\n\nMuch of the negative criticizes the wooden acting, soap-opera beautiful stars, and unreasonably military tactics that lead to an enormous human body count.  \n\nBut that misses the whole point.  The actors and plotlines are supposed to be caricatures of themselves.  We are presented with a seemingly utopian society, where everyone is beautiful, the world is united under a single government, and patriotism is rampant.\n\nThe further the movie goes, the more the viewer realizes just how horrific this supposed utopia really is.  Patriotism is exploited to trick young men and women into going off to a pointless war.  The beautiful people are mercilessly chopped to pieces by their insectoid opponents.  And the united world government uses its control of the media to brainwash the public into supporting this bloody war.\n\nYes, the Nazi symbolism is a little heavy-handed.  But that&apos;s the whole point -- the intertwining of this &quot;perfect&quot; society with such a deeply evil subtext is supposed to be disturbing.  What&apos;s even more disturbing is how close to our recent (American) history this movie truly is.  Yes, it&apos;s a caricature, but it&apos;s a caricature of a very real and frightening phenomenon.\n\nHow different are the government propaganda ads in Starship Troopers from the &quot;Loose Lips Sink Ships&quot; campaign or the &quot;10% for War Bonds&quot; posters in 1940s U.S.?  How dangerous is it to have a society where everyone looks the same, thinks the same, and acts the same, even to their own death?  This is the message behind Starship Troopers, and it&apos;s a chilling one at that.\n\nAnd for me, it works."

      "name": "A different kind of gangster film...",
      "reviewBody": "... at least for early sound. The title character in particular, Thunderbolt, played by George Bancroft, is a rather complex gangster character for a dawn of sound movie. What do you say about a man who&apos;d go to great lengths to kill a fellow he has never met just on general principle but who loves the stray dog that causes him to finally get pinched and put in the death house to the point that when the death house warden grants him a favor, Thunderbolt asks for that same dog to stay in his cell as a pet? Fay Wray, only 21 at the time, plays Ritzy, Thunderbolt&apos;s girl, with a sense of world-weariness that is wise beyond her years. When the film opens she&apos;s being hassled by the police to give up Thunderbolt&apos;s hiding place in some really classic early sound police interrogation scenes. Ironically, she really wants to be free of Thunderbolt, who swears he&apos;ll never let her go, especially if there&apos;s another guy involved, and there is - bank teller Bob Morgan played by Richard Arlen.\n\nThe first third of the film moves about quite a bit with some great jazz age settings, but the last two-thirds is primarily confined to the death house where Thunderbolt awaits his appointment with the chair. There&apos;s lots of atmosphere in this one with the death row quartet that keeps getting broken up as one fellow is executed and then restarted as another inmate enters. The death row warden is an interesting fellow, with eccentricity and nervousness balanced by a humane streak to the point that he seems misplaced - he seems like he&apos;d be happier managing the shoe department in some retail store.\n\nThe end has a surprise twist to it that makes Thunderbolt rethink his rather complex plan of revenge just as he makes that last walk to the chair. I&apos;m being intentionally vague here so I don&apos;t ruin it for you. Watch it for the surprising sophistication of this early sound piece, for the kind of atmosphere you can always count on in a von Sternberg film, and for that general touch of class that you find in the early Paramount talkies.",

Each of us has dreams and regrets and desire of beginning. Each of us is confronted with decisions, responsabilities, duties. And the answer is not alwazs the best. So, a magnificent film about people, vulnerabilities, crisis and the cold solution."

I&apos;ve never seen how they do these wonderful operatic festivals and I really liked it.  Georgeous technicolor.  However, I could not find this movie reviewed in any of my review books: perhaps it&apos;s known by another name.\n\nIt is never clear what illness Bardot has in this movie....could have been a nervous breakdown, could have been flu, who knows?

The action sequences are tremendous, and there&apos;s a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn&apos;t quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it&apos;s an incredible movie.\n\nIt&apos;s one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what&apos;s happening only seems to make it more satisfying.\n\nThe cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it&apos;s a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.\n\n10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Baazigar is a wonderful suspense thriller made by Abbas Mastan, but the real reason it is well-known today is quite clear, and it&apos;s called Shahrukh Khan. Disregarding its unoriginality, the film is extremely entertaining and interesting, more towards the second half. In the first half, the point is a bit unclear and the film does not flow well, but the film takes a major plot twist after an hour or so when we get to see a rather shocking scene, which is completely unexpected and is the film&apos;s most drastic turn. Following this scene, it starts getting increasingly thrilling with inflaming and unusual proceedings and great suspense. I appreciated the film for its good script and for its loyalty to the general Hindi film style despite a very distinct and innovative formula, but I would still delete several comic scenes which are unnecessary and at times even pathetic. \n\nThe film quite clearly belongs to Shahrukh Khan who skillfully displays something very disturbing within his personality. It is a very balanced performance, and Khan successfully portrays the many sides of his character, whether it&apos;s the simple guy whose pain motivates him to take revenge, the romantic hero, or the psychopathic murderer. Kajol is splendid in a performance that is both natural and intense. She comes across as a very brave and smart girl. Shilpa Shetty gives a brilliant debut performance (and she is hot!). Raakhee is typecast as the suffering mother who loses her mental sanity, and she does it well. Johnny Lever is at times hilarious and at times unbearable, Dalip Tahil does not impress much, and Siddharth is adequate but he too is a bit annoying in some scenes.\n\nAnu Malik&apos;s soundtrack is very good: &quot;Baazigar O Baazigar&quot; is lovely, &quot;Kitaben Bahut Si&quot; is wonderful, &quot;Ae Mere Humsafar&quot; is melodious and &quot;Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhen&quot; is too cool. Overall, Baazigar is an extremely enjoyable flick. While the first half is a bit boring, involving all the possible Bollywood masala, including action, romance and silly jokes, the second half enjoys a fantastic development of story, involving the most unconventional moves a Hindi film could have at that time. Towards the end the film gets to be even more intriguing. A very sad flashback is followed by an unpredictable ending which is heart-breaking yet satisfying. The final verdict is therefore highly positive. I recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "By all means not a great film, with a silly premise not made any less so. However it is easy to like and does liven up the spirits as long as not too much is expected.\n\n&apos;Pigskin Parade&apos; is mainly notable for being the film debut of 14-year old Judy Garland, but it is worth watching for more than just historical interest. Garland&apos;s performance is certainly one of &apos;Pigskin Parade&apos;s&apos; standout features, she is a real charmer here and not only does she look like she is having a lot of fun but she gets ample opportunity to show off her unmistakable vocal pipes and sounds fabulous for so young.\n\nTony Martin is also very early in his career, and does make an impression singing the film&apos;s best song &quot;You&apos;re Slightly Terrific&quot;. Betty Grable is similarly charmingly perky, while Stuart Erwin, though am personally not sure about the Oscar-nomination especially with greats like Walter Brennan and Basil Rathbone also in the running in the category that year, is fun and endearing. A pre-&apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; Jack Haley does just fine, while Patsy Kelly comes very close to stealing the show as a less than subtle character. Love her chemistry with Haley, which can be uproarious to watch. Nice to see Elisha Cook Jnr.\n\nVisually, while not exactly lavish &apos;Pigskin Parade&apos; is attractive enough, everything is shot well and it was made with care. The bright and breezy direction from David Butler helps. The songs are hardly award-worthy and they vary in the memorability and relevance factor but they are very energetic and pleasant, while they are not necessarily &quot;great&quot; songs count me in as somebody who enjoyed listening to them. &quot;You&apos;re Slightly Terrific&quot; and Garland&apos;s numbers come off best, and they&apos;re staged in a way that isn&apos;t big and bold but never static or indifferent either, due to that the cast seem to be enjoying themselves too much.\n\nScripting has its snappy and funny moments, the film never drags and has a breeziness throughout.\n\nNot that &apos;Pigskin Parade&apos; is perfect this said. The story is thin, does get contrived in places and is as old as the hills. Some of the script is corny and overly-silly, with some of the comedy over-played on odd occasions. Could have done with less of the Yacht Club Boys, they serve little purpose other than their songs and their performing style is neither interesting or fun and grates somewhat, trying to see them pass for college kids even for comedy strains credibility beyond belief.\n\nOverall, not great but good undemanding fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Needless to say that I had never actually heard about this 1988 Indonesian horror movie titled &quot;Santet&quot; from writers Naryono Prayitno and Tim Soraya prior to sitting down and watching it here in 2024. I happened to stumble upon it, and given my love of both the horror genre and Asian cinema, then of course I had to watch this movie.\n\nBut never having heard about it, I have to say that I didn&apos;t know what I was in for here, nor did I have any expectations from director Sisworo Gautama Putra.\n\nI have to say that &quot;Santet&quot; felt more like a horror comedy than an actual horror movie. Why? Well, some of the characters were written like goofy morons, acting silly and delivering goofy dialogue. And the music in the movie just didn&apos;t really permeate a horror atmosphere, as it was way too cheery and silly.\n\nAnd suddenly there was a song and musical number in the movie. Are you kidding me? That just was insanely laughable. Once again, not adding to this supposed to be an actual horror movie.\n\nSuffice it to say that I wasn&apos;t familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list. However, I can&apos;t claim to say that I was overly impressed with the acting performances throughout the course of the movie.\n\n&quot;Santet&quot; was quite a difficult movie to sit through, because the storyline was rubbish, and there wasn&apos;t really anything interesting happening throughout the course of the 94 minutes that the movie ran for. I guess maybe if you&apos;re high on mushrooms you might get a kick out of watching this strange movie and enjoy the spaced out music.\n\nThere were a couple of gory scenes in the movie, but it was hardly sufficient to make it worthwhile sitting through 94 minutes of watching this nonsense. And the special effects were pretty low-key and lousy to look at.\n\nThis is definitely not a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend for fans of horror movies or Asian cinema to actually sit down and waste their time on watching.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Santet&quot; lands on a two out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I have been following this director for a while and I always liked his films but this time he has exceeded my expectations.\n\n&apos;The Claim&apos; is like an ancient greek tragedy and Dillon is its&apos; hero. Dillon is a man who goes West with his wife and new born daughter in order to find gold.  In the process he sells his wife and his daughter in exchange for that gold. Years later his wife will come back to haunt him and Dillon comes to realize how empty his life has been, how irrelevant wealth can be to happiness.  The story is so beautifully told and the last scene where the people of the new city of Lisboa prey on Dillon&apos;s gold is a metaphor or at least I would like it to be. I think Winterbottom wanted to show how the world will never change, how people will continue to go after that gold.  Dillon came and went, but he didn&apos;t leave anything behind him.  He achieved all those things, he was a pioneer he went out West, he was one of the people who built America but he didn&apos;t win his daughter&apos;s heart.  And it makes one wonder, what was the point of his life. &apos;The Claim&apos; is the story of America itself, an America that was built on greed, on the quest for new lands, new conquers and prosperity. Peter Mullan gives us an excellent performance, as well as Sarah Polley as the elegant young daughter and Milla Jovovich. Nastasia Kinsky has a rather insignificant role and Wes Bentley is disappointing. Overall, a very good film, a piece of art by Winterbottom and a story that you won&apos;t forget for a while.",

Will meets his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult who&apos;s so bitter, he&apos;s chosen the path of crime. Both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness, which enables them to get unstuck.\n\nFor these young adults, getting unstuck, or, breaking free, can mean both forging ahead into life, and plunging downward into death.\n\nWill&apos;s life is filled with the trademarks of a young &quot;stuck&quot; adult: a soul-sucking, sweaty, under-paying job, crude customers, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college education with no degree, a house filled with self-made art, and of course the new friend whose ung-dly choices help him to save himself.",

It is rare that I uncover a new classic film favorite, but I did with this film.\n\n&quot;Romance in Manhattan&quot; works so well thanks to the wonderful performances by Ginger Rogers and especially Francis Lederer. I would have loved to see him hit stardom, but he had a long career and lived 100 years despite not becoming a household name. Lederer is so charismatic and handsome in this film with such an exuberant spirit. A young Ginger Rogers is lovely, has great chemistry with Lederer, and is a loving sister. \n\nThere are two subplots, but this is mostly about a man coming to America to live the &quot;American Dream&quot; which he does while finding romance along with it. If that appeals to you, then I highly recommend this delightful little gem.",

      "reviewBody": "Set in Brooklyn, New York where he currently lives, Ryan Fleck&apos;s first full-length feature, Half Nelson, is a gritty, sensitive, and emotionally harrowing film that meticulously avoids the inspirational clichés of many teacher-student films and the obligatory violence of films set in the ghetto. The title is derived from a wrestling move in which you turn an attacker&apos;s strength back on him. In the case of Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), an idealistic eight-grade history teacher in an inner city school, he turns the attack on himself, inspiring his students by day and drugging himself at night with crack cocaine.\n\nDan is a well-liked teacher and basketball coach whose parents (Deborah Rush and Jay O. Sanders) were liberal activists during the 60s and 70s, participating in protests against the Vietnam War but have now substituted alcoholism for political passion. Like his parents, he wants to make an impact on the world but is disillusioned with the current political climate and, out of frustration and fatigue, (like many on the Left today) has drifted into a self-induced stupor. Believing in social justice and that society can be changed through education, he teaches history, to the chagrin of the school&apos;s administrator, in the form of Hegelian dialectic, showing that change results from a clash of opposites.\n\nDan shows his students videos of seminal events from the last fifty years such as the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling that paved the way for desegregation of the schools, clips from the civil rights movement, and Mario Savio speaking on the Berkeley campus during the Free Speech Movement. To its credit, the events in the film do not occur in a political vacuum but attempts to tie in the failed protests of the Left to Dan&apos;s drug habit are not entirely persuasive. Dunne&apos;s life begins to spiral out of control when one of his students, thirteen-year old Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers him in the girl&apos;s bathroom passed out from ingesting cocaine. Instead of becoming frightened or angry, Drey brings him water and helps him to gradually come down from his high.\n\nDrey comes from a family in which her mother works a double shift and is rarely at home, her father is out of town, and her older brother is in prison for selling drugs, but she is mature and street-wise beyond her age. She promises to keep his secret and both find that their unlikely friendship satisfies an emotional need that Drey cannot find with her classmates and Dan cannot find with other adults. He is dating a fellow teacher (Monique Curnen) but his behavior with her is erratic and his political speeches and drug habits soon turn her off. A former girl friend from his period of rehabilitation (which he said didn&apos;t work for him) tells him that she is now getting married which pushes him further into a downward trajectory.\n\nThe emotional highlight of the film is a confrontation between Dunne and Frank (Anthony Mackie), a suave drug dealer and associate of Drey&apos;s older brother who recruits Drey to be his collector. While Dan wants to steer Drey in the right direction, he is hardly a role model and the results, while promising, are inconclusive. Although the premise of the film is somewhat implausible, Gosling&apos;s performance of the charming but flawed teacher is completely credible, so nuanced and touching that we root for him in spite of his capacity for self-destruction. Shareeka Epps is equally convincing in her powerfully understated performance as his tough but sensitive young friend. Co-written by Anna Boden and supported by an outstanding original score by Broken Social Scene, Half Nelson &quot;stands and delivers&quot; one of the finest films of the year.",

Then the young hitch-hiker appeared and I thought. &quot;Oh no! Cutesy-pooh-made-for-TV family schmaltz,&quot; but, I was home, sick, on the sofa, and Tom Selleck&apos;s usually worth watching so.... The movie hadn&apos;t got very far before I realised that I was watching something pretty extraordinary. It was a movie that was inviting me to think, to think about what it means to be a man, and and in particular, a strong man who is facing the alien world of age and declining powers. Tom Selleck&apos;s performance showed, to me, a man who, through his relationship with the girl (great actress by the way!) learnt something about life, and drew strength and comfort from the knowledge, whilst she drew greater strength and understanding of the world as a result of being treated like an adult for the first time. If a really cheesy director had been in charge, I can see these words rolling across the screen at the end: &quot;Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.&quot; (Tennyson)",

      "reviewBody": "On the one hand, it has Gene Kelly and direction by George Cukor and the smart, smooth music of Cole Porter. But the structure of the plot is a bit bumpy, and most of this bumpiness stems from the RASHOMON-like tale starting, stopping, and starting again over two hours. A lot of people seem to think that the Porter score was sub-par; I wholeheartedly disagree. An especially lovely sequence is a rowboat scene between Kelly and Taina Elg which segues into the love song &quot;Ca C&apos;est L&apos;amour.&quot; Also clever are the burlesque turn of &quot;Ladies In Waiting&quot; and the vaudeville-like &quot;You&apos;re Just Too, Too&quot; which pairs Kelly with the rapturous Kay Kendall. Kendall is, in many ways, the real star of LG with her deft comedy (drunkenly singing opera for five straight minutes!) and her cool, elegant beauty. Knowing that she died shortly after completing this film- and so young- makes one miss her charms all the more and also wish that the film had a larger following. (It&apos;s particularly enigmatic nowadays when compared to Kelly&apos;s bigger and better known hits: &apos;Singin&apos; In The Rain,&apos; &apos;An American In Paris,&apos; &apos;Anchors Aweigh,&apos; etc.) Still, Mitzi Gaynor is a dish, dancing with Kelly in a sexy black dress (in a weird Marlon-Brando-a&apos;la-THE-WILD-ONE-send up). Thank goodness it&apos;s on widescreen DVD where it belongs.",

      "reviewBody": "The Ambulance actually turned out to be a pretty funny, yet bizarre thriller. Sarcastic extrovert, Josh Baker (Eric Roberts in a hilarious role), probably regrets the day he talked to a woman that he felt compelled to introduce himself to, having always seen her on his lunch break. The woman, a diabetic, suddenly collapses in the street, and he is there as she is carried away in a hearse-turned-ambulance with a mysterious green glowing light in the back. She gets in the ambulance, and as Josh later discovers, she never arrives at any of the local hospitals. \n\nJosh is convinced something is awry, but doesn&apos;t pay too much attention to it at first (in fact, as bizarre as the story becomes, he&apos;s so matter-of-fact about everything. Him and everyone else). The more people he confronts about the strange ambulance that conveniently seems to arrive when he&apos;s talking to them but never seems to be around when he needs to prove it exists, the more likely those people are going to wind up dead because of the ambulance (actually, because of the people driving it, who are the goons for a strange doctor who is using his victims for a strange medical experiment). \n\nJosh&apos;s only hope, besides himself (a guy who will soon be quite immune to pain as he gets hit by cars, jumps through barred doors, is drugged, and finally beat by a junkyard gang), is the red head cop Sandra Malloy who turns up after her boss, Spencer (James Earl Jones in an even funnier part as the disbeliever), turns up missing. And if they don&apos;t act fast, the ambulance will show up for them, and the only chance of stopping it will be lost. \n\nAll in all, the story is bizarre, but the movie is much more of a comedy than a thriller in sort of that &apos;After Hours&apos; style of comedy. Josh appears to be absolutely crazy to those around him, babbling about some weird ambulance that is out to murder people. But he seems to dismiss the seriousness of it, just hoping to save the girl and get through the day, and not much else. Eric Roberts and Red Buttons, too, made a good team, albeit a brief one with Red Buttons as Elias Zacharai, the fast-talking newspaper reporter who befriends Josh and has similar convictions about the hospital staff trying to drug up patients and keep them against his will, but in that senile old man kind of way. He plays the reporter that wants the exclusive story on the ambulance. \n\nLoosen up and give it a try. Though cheap, it&apos;s got some good action sequences, a decent plot, and is just overall, pretty funny. Except, for maybe the ending. It was just too easy.",

To make things worse, the script is based on a true story, but it doesn&apos;t *tell* that story, and even if you are a close follower of the air traffic control scene, chances are you won&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ll give it 5 of 10 anyway, on the grounds of a single memorable scene: Marie Bäumer&apos;s character Franziska has just lost her husband. She&apos;s on the phone with her secret long-time lover to arrange a consolatory rendezvous as her mother-in-law walks in. Time itself seems suspended for a split second. She could simply hang up and play the grieving widow. Or maybe not. Suffice it to say Franziska takes a dramatic decision that will define who she is once and for all. Judge for yourself, but that scene made my day.",

It epitomizes the typical good hearted man in a bad situation who undergoes a character transformation worthy of old Scrooge himself.  Bob Hope plays a grifter who tries to play both sides of a scam.  All of this is infused with just the right amount of holiday fun and Christmas Carols (and even a few cracks at Bing) to make it a real holiday classic.  I would recommend it for any age and any family.",

Their journey is full of difficulties, as the war breaks out and racial tension mounts.\n\n&quot;The Bubble&quot; examines what it is like to have a relationship in a society full of racial tensions and people with closed minds. I feel for Ashraf so much, as his family is not accepting towards his sexuality, and also the tragic events that occur in his family towards the end of the film. Fortunately, the film has lighter moments, as the youngsters party their way through the night in the name of peace.\n\nThe ending few seconds are so powerful that it has a haunting effect on me. Even though &quot;The Bubble&quot; is more of a romantic comedy than a depressing drama, it still will move everyone to tears."

When his parents ask him among which of his girlfriends he wants to marry, they get surprised when he wishes to have a traditional arranged marriage of 5 days in which you get to see bride&apos;s face only on the wedding day. His parents find a girl deepthi(bhanusree) for him and he likes her on the wedding day. But soon deepthi gets kidnapped by a psycho gangster divakar(arya). Rest of the film is why divakar kidnaps deepthi and how sandeep saves her. The story of the film is very good as it helps today&apos;s generation to understand the values of traditional values. Second thing i liked was the music. My favorite song was aidhurojula pelli. Allu arjun&apos;s performance was good and arya handled his over the top character well. But where this film fails is when director tries to make it a mass masala film in the second half. He couldn&apos;t package the film properly. The film was marketed by not revealing the heroine&apos;s face until the release. But that plan backfires as the heroine does not have the required looks nor gives a good performance. Kallalu kaavule song was not picturised well. There were unnecessary dance steps in it. And the climax fight in tower is copied from xmen origins wolverine. On the whole, varudu would have been a great movie if the director had done his work properly.",

However, one thing about Jiang Wen&apos;s movies is that they are so technically interesting that it is difficult to see what his movie is about as a whole.\n\n Anyway, I highly recommend this film.",

I know that any unknown film would be harshly judged by the mob rule of three hundred, irritable, over-tired nerds. They probably hated it.\n\nLook at all of the positive reviews this film got through the mainstream press and movie reviewers. They are NOT all friends of the filmmaker. It had an enjoyable Twilight Zone 50&apos;s feel. Thanks Monsterpants DOT com."

      "reviewBody": "A splatter classic, Marino Girolami&apos;s &quot;Zombi Holocaust&quot; of 1980 doesn&apos;t scant with blood and gore. A true B-movie and pure exploitation, this movie is probably not high art, however, I don&apos;t suppose that anybody who is about to watch a movie entitled &quot;Zombie Holocaust&quot; is gonna expect Citizen Kane.\n\nAfter several mutilations of corpses in the morgue of a New York hospital, and the appearance of a mysterious cannibal sign, a group of people, amongst them a beautiful female doctor and a bitchy journalist, decide to go on an expedition to a tropical island, where they expect to find out about the sign&apos;s origin. This is, of course, not a very good idea. Not only is the island inhabited by cannibals, but it is also haunted by the living dead.\n\nOne of the classic Italian splatter flicks, &quot;Zombi Holocaust&quot;, is a fun and entertaining, although not very thrilling movie, that mainly concentrates on the enormous amounts of blood and gore and on constant very graphical violence. The acting in this movie differs. As a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I found it cool to see Donal O&apos;Brien, who delivers a great performance as a mad scientist in this, in a non-western role. The Italian and English title is maybe not the best to describe the movie, since its the Cannibals, and not the Zombies who kill the most people. The German title &quot;Zombies Unter Kannibalen&quot; (&quot;Zombies Amongst Cannibals&quot;) is probably better to describe the film&apos;s content.\n\nAll things considered, &quot;Zombie Holocaust&quot; is a highly entertaining and very bloody Gorefest that fans of the Cannibal subgenre should not miss. Entertainment guaranteed!",

      "reviewBody": "This powerful drama takes place in a remakable geographical setting, a fascinating treat to be at the very tip of the Shiretoko Peninsular. It is the easternmost portion of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, protruding into the Sea of Okhotsk. Incredibly scenic with an extreme winter this frigid inhospitable landscape is the setting of this harrowing tale. Visiting the remote town of Rasu a novelist looking for inspiration meets up with the local headmaster who guides the author to local caves where famously rare local flora thrive, green glowing moss. While at the caves the headmaster relates back to an incident that occurred here in the past...\n\nIn 1943 just off the coast a convoy loaded with army munitions got into trouble one of the ships was abandoned the fate of the others unknown. A captain &amp; three sailors make it to shore and discover the welcome shelter of the cave. Cold and starving &amp; facing the approach of a severe winter, which blocks with drift ice any sea access, the prospects for rescue &amp; survival are grim. In absolute hunger in desperation the men consider eating human flesh, after one of their crewmates has just died.... The tense film is an absorbing psychological drama, a brilliant multi faceted story. With a social conscious, here as in previous films Kei Kumai raises issues &amp; interweaves thought provoking layers. He adapted the tale from avant-garde novelist Taijun Takeda the story is based on a true incident. Credit must go to Kumai for his bold determination filming in such remote and hostile climatic conditions. A standout cast is headed by captain/headmaster Rentaro Mikuni who gives tremendous depth of character, his personal tale very much the centre of the story. Accompanying is a fabulous evocative soundtrack from Teizo Matsumura Genre labels as Horror, mysterious is the glowing moss, horror abounds but not through supernatural elements, it is a slow burn horror arising from the darkest depths of human despair. Highly Recommended !!",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a couch potato with a mild aversion against fashion sports like surfing, skating, and whatever it is that tattooed and pierced people while away their time with. I still saw this movie because it deals with an unusual local spot, the Eisbach in Munich, which has long been known for attracting surfers riding on a stationary wave there, which is always fun to watch when you pass by. I was wondering how they could make a worthwhile film about that bunch of &quot;park bums&quot; (vs. beach bums, as the spot is at the entrance of the city park), but was quickly captivated and couldn&apos;t stop the film until it was late in the night and the end credits rolled. What pulled me in was that the film didn&apos;t start as expected, with the scene on the Eisbach (literally &quot;icy brook&quot;), but with a group of river surfers taking off to France to explore temporary stationary waves on the flooded Rhône river. It was a very smart move of the film makers to expand the focus of the film to the larger issue of river surfing, while taking the story of a bunch of local kids who discover a new form of surfing by themselves. There is a number of small, fast streams in Bavaria, and it was a local habit to ride their fast bits standing on a board tied to a tree branch. I tried it myself but was too fat and uncoordinated to succeed. Others had more enthusiasm and found to their surprise that you didn&apos;t actually need the rope to ride the wave (something that you still can&apos;t really understand, it just happens -- it&apos;s much easier to grasp the idea of sliding down a wave on a board). The movie documents a few whacky kids who built the lives around this intriguing facts -- some as a hobby, some as a philosophy, one as a surfing pro. The movie throws no punches that this bettered each and one of them -- unlike the Californian surfer who claims that it saved him personally. Well made, fascinating and very entertaining.",

It is exactly as it describes itself: a parody, and this is one of the better ones. I recommend this to anyone who likes parodies, if you don&apos;t laugh at this, then you are seriously lacking in the humor department. Four stars! I&apos;ve watched this movie several times, and laugh at each viewing. It&apos;s not for those who are seeking intelligent humor, it&apos;s geared to those who just like cheap laughs. The girls are definitely hot, and Mia changes costumes several times, each one will make any guy&apos;s libido stand at attention. After watching this on cable I purchased the DVD, and look forward to laughing again and again. My compliments to the chef who cooked up this winner."

      "name": "The Many Faces of the Immigration Issue",
      "reviewBody": "Though there have been many films about the horrors faced by illegal  immigrants attempting to get into or stay in the US, few films have  addressed the issues on both sides of the table as well as CROSSING  OVER. This film probably did not do very well in theatrical release  because of the very difficult subject matter with which it confronts  the audience: few people who go to the movies to escape the realities  of life outside elect to be disturbed. CROSSING OVER, as written and  directed by Wayne Kramer, forces us to learn just how treacherous the  matter of immigration is on every level - from the border incidents, to  document fraud, to worksite enforcement/raiding, to the concept of  asylum, to naturalization, the green card process, the problematic  office of counter terrorism, and finally to the basic cultural clashes  that pit compassionate law officers against red neck raider type  officers.   To absorb the intricately woven aspects of the script, a script that  addresses immigration issues dealing with Koreans, Africans, Iranians,  Australians, Mexicans, and Jewish/atheist Britishers, the audience must  pay close attention lest the subtleties are lost in the swirling  nonstop drama. Harrison Ford as the compassionate, burned out  immigration officer Max Brogan holds the film together as he attempts  to make sense of the various irregularities in every aspect of the  immigration process. His partner is Iranian American Hamid (a  particularly fine performance by Cliff Curtis) who faces family  problems with his American born sister and his father who is on the  brink of naturalization - one of the many subplots that involves &apos;honor  killing&apos;. Another man Cole Frankel (Ray Liotta is a smarmy role)  reveals another view of a &apos;bad agent&apos; while his wife Denise (Ashley  Judd) fights for the rights of an African orphan held for 23 months  awaiting sponsorship. A brave Iranian girl Taslima (Summer Bishil)  speaks out for the rights of Muslims to be heard and plunges her family  into deportation problems. Among the other subplots are stories about a  Korean family whose one son (Justin Chon) is forced into gang warfare,  an Australian actress (Alice Eve) who must secure her green card  through sexual favors with Cole Frankel, a Mexican mother Mireya (Alice  Braga) who is captured during a raid at a workplace and befriended by  Max Brogan, and young British musician (Jim Sturgess) who must convince  authorities of his &apos;Jewishness&apos; in order to maintain a job that will  result in a green card.   Each of these stories represents an aspect of our current dysfunctional  system management of immigration. The film does not take sides: it  merely presents a smattering of the atrocities and imperfectly managed  departments of government that together form a system that is chaotic.  Of interest, Sean Penn (listed as being in the cast on this page of  Amazon.com) requested his small role be cut because of the objections  of Iranian-American groups over the use of the &apos;honor killing&apos; subplot.  That may indicate how many people may view this film: the story will  either anger or disgust some viewers. But what this very well acted and  produced and directed film does is provide windows through which we may  more closely examine the tragedies of our current immigration system.  Perhaps change will occur once people are informed of the injustices.  Grady Harp",

But lo and behold, their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family&apos;s maniacal games? \n\nI don&apos;t have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can&apos;t make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.\n\nThis was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles (&quot;Casper&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin&quot;) but this is, beyond a doubt, where she fits. She can do drama (&quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;) but will always be America&apos;s goth girl.\n\nThis film&apos;s dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated. Well, aside from the sequel.",

The contrast in Ray&apos;s approach with his classic trilogy is astonishing, considering the mileau in which it emerged.  Filmmaking in the 1950&apos;s in Hollywood as well as India was studio-driven with light-weight stories having little connection with reality.  As another  commentator pointed out, this film is closer to the Italian realism films such as &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;.  Every shot is a masterpiece of composition and lighting.  It does not intrude on  the story, but advances it.  Likewise, the music composed by Ray, is natural and integral to  the  scene.  This ranks with the all-time greatest  watershed movies.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; when it came out in 1995 and have seen it again some 3 or 4 times since, a practice I dedicate only to &quot;certified&quot; masterpieces. At first, I couldn&apos;t figure out why I kept revisiting &quot;D.C.&quot; when it showed up on cable - it&apos;s not a cinematic wonder or a work of art (something it doesn&apos;t strive to be, by the way), not even a story that you can say it&apos;s really original. But as I became more familiar with the film, I could see why it always pulled me in: it&apos;s a triumph of story-telling, of the WAY and PACE the story is revealed in small precise doses much like slowly completing a puzzle, the kind of film you can only let go when the last missing piece (Selena&apos;s final flashback) fits into place. \n\nHow the story manages to make such initially repulsive characters (all of them!!) develop into sympathetic (or at least pathetic) ones is of course Stephen King&apos;s special talent, expertly translated by the fine jobs by the screenwriter, actors and director of &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. The cinematography is kind of obvious in its distinct color treatment of past and present, but the entire cast is inspired, including Kathy Bates&apos; best-ever performance (she has stated so herself), especially in the flash-back scenes; delightfully virtuoso Judy Parfitt (you just keep hoping along for more Vera&apos;s scenes, and each one of them is a knockout); and reliable pros Christopher Plummer, David Strathairn (such an underrated actor!) and John C. Reilly. Even Jennifer Jason Leigh for once has her irritating mannerisms fit perfectly to build her terribly tormented character.\n\nThat&apos;s what good story-telling is all about: even if you already know the plot from A to Z, you just want to see once again the way it unfolds, like a good scary fairy tale. &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; is not without faults, but it&apos;s certainly worth your time, and even more than once.",

Like so many other horror flicks of its day, this movie lifts its plot from THE EXORCIST, and also seizes the opportunity to &quot;borrow&quot; elements from ROSEMARY&apos;S BABY. Juliet Mills plays the wife of a successful San Francisco record producer who becomes possessed by you know who..... Mills(the older sister of Hayley) is a very beautiful and supremely gifted actress, but the repetitive and repulsive script has given her very little to do but spin her head and spit up pea soup. Co-star Richard Johnson is also a talented actor who is severely misused. Director Hellman went on to make a JAWS rip-off entitled TENTACLES. That film also features a great cast at their all-time worst."

I can&apos;t think of one single thing that&apos;s positive about it. We are talking about a product that (they said) needed a budget of 4 million euro, a small part of that it&apos;s public funds (about 30k euro).

      "name": "Good film about the start of the British airborne",
      "reviewBody": "This film is a very good look at the start of the British airborne forces during World War II. &quot;Paratrooper&quot; was released in America in late December 1953, more than four months after it premiered in the U. K. where it was called &quot;The Red Beret.&quot; That is the name of the book from which the film is adapted, written by Hillary St. George Saunders.\n\nColumbia studios clearly made the film for people on both sides of the pond. So, the plot includes an American who enlists in the British Army in Canada. That&apos;s OK, and we know quite a few American fliers joined the war effort early by serving in the RAF. Here it provides the love interest part of the film that Hollywood often included for wider audience appeal. But, I think any number of other actors might have filled the role better than Alan Ladd. His Private McKendrick (aka, &quot;Canada&quot;) seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. We learn of his background halfway into the film, and one can understand his experience affecting him. But, not that he would be so touchy and angry toward other men. Whatever the reason, his character doesn&apos;t come across as genuine.\n\nThat aside, I give this film eight stars for its interesting and early look at jump school training and the start of the British Airborne. Years later, I served as a paratrooper in the U. S. 504th and 509th Airborne regiments (1962 through 1964). Americans train at the Ft. Benning, GA, jump school. I became familiar with the British Airborne while stationed in what was then West Germany. We had NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) military exercises in Europe with the Brits, West Germans, and others. And, I was in charge of our airborne PIO (Public Information Office) when we sent one of our troopers through the British jump school. He photographed and reported on it. And, yes, the Brits were still jumping from balloons in training.\n\nFrom its very beginning jump training has undergone changes, just as the aircraft, equipment and other things have changed. The film shows the first planes the Brits used. They were modified Wellington bombers and men dropped through an opening in the floor. Soon, &quot;Dakotas&quot; (Douglas C-47s) arrived from the U. S., and troopers jumped out of side doors behind the propellers. In 1962, I trained in C-119 &quot;Flying Boxcars,&quot; and then jumped from C-130s (Hercules transports) and helicopters in Germany.\n\nThe Brits needed to make seven jumps to earn their parachutist wings. We had to make five jumps in the U. S. The film shows training in hand-to-hand combat. Americans got that in advanced infantry training before Jump School. We don&apos;t see any other physical training in the film, but all paratroopers have much more rigorous physical conditioning. One thing was glaring to me - I didn&apos;t see a single trooper land with a PLF (parachute landing fall). Maybe this wasn&apos;t developed until well after the war, but PLF landing had tremendous results in reducing injuries. In a nutshell, the trooper is trained to turn or orient his chute for a side landing, and then in a relaxed position as his feet touch the ground, he rolls his body to the right or left, with his calf, then hip, then side absorbing the impact. In the 17 jumps I made, I only got hurt once, when I landed on a big boulder right in the middle of my back.\n\nIn this movie, Stanley Baker plays one of the training cadre, Sgt. Breton. On the first airplane jump, his chute fails to open and he falls to his death. The Brits called his malfunction a Roman candle. In the American airborne, we call it a cigarette roll. But it&apos;s interesting that the Brits apparently didn&apos;t carry reserve chutes. They didn&apos;t appear to have them on in the film. So far as I know, American paratroopers always have had a reserve chute on the front. If anyone had a cigarette roll or other malfunction, he would release the main chute and pull the ripcord on his reserve. I saw half a dozen or more uses of the reserves in my airborne service. Some other things missing from this film were training jumps from towers. In one scene, I can see what looks like a 250-foot tower in the background. I also enjoyed the portrayal of the chute packing unit. It&apos;s too bad they didn&apos;t show the actual packing tables. And the funniest thing in this film is the strange looking headgear the Brits wore in jump school.\n\n&quot;Paratrooper&quot; is a good portrayal of the early action of the British Airborne. I thank Steve Crook from London, who&apos;s review tipped me off to the background of Major Snow. Leo Genn plays the part very well in this film. Snow was John Frost in real life. He became best known after his paratrooper battalion took the north end of the Arnhem Bridge in Operation Market Garden in September 1944. The Brits held out four days against a German Panzer division. They were captured only after they ran out of ammunition. In the 1977 blockbuster movie, &quot;A Bridge Too Far,&quot; Anthony Hopkins plays Lt. Col. Frost beautifully. Frost retired as a Major General in 1968, and was a close adviser on that film.\n\nThe only thing I see wrong in this movie is the name of the first operation the troopers had. Major Snow calls it &quot;Operation Pegasus.&quot; In fact, it was called Operation Biting, also known as the Bruneval Raid. There was a real Operation Pegasus, and it was the escape plan across the Rhine River for many of the Brits trapped by the Germans in Operation Market Garden.\n\nWar movie fans and those who like history especially should enjoy this film.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the few good things that I can say, is that I luckily did not go to a cinema to watch it. And I wanted to, but when it came out I never had the time to go see it. Which means I saved money (the renting of the disc was far cheaper), but on the other hand I did not save myself from a dreading annoying experience.\n\nPeople who know the singer Sasha (german Star of sorts), will understand where this is going, when I state that he was by far the best &quot;actor&quot; in this mess. A movie that tries to capture the found footage craze (in the most horrible way you can imagine, that doesn&apos;t even make sense, unless it was meant to be shot part found footage, part &quot;normal&quot; filmmaking. But even that is executed poorly at best) with a bit of a Hangover.\n\nThe biggest problem is, that it&apos;s a lot of build-up, but no real payoff. The movie struggles to find a rhythm, but never does have anything to show for itself. A script filled with ideas that may have sounded good, when they were thought of, but never were realized in a fashion that is slightly funny. If you want found footage that is aiming at Hangover or American Pie style humor, go watch &quot;Project X&quot;. For all it&apos;s faults, it&apos;s way better than this right here. And if you want a real comedy about marriage, either watch &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (which seems to get ripped off here too, but completely unoriginal and far from funny, which is the one thing the movie keeps in sync throughout -&gt; how bad it is and stays) or go watch &quot;A few best men&quot;! Comedy gold and no holds barred. Avoid this at any cost, unless it is meant as punishment for someone else (but why be so cruel?)",

Although there may appear to be echoes of and borrowings from such American movies as &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, it turns out to have characteristically Hong Kong elements (&quot;wire fu&quot; fights, cross-dressing, etc. -- all featuring the hero, as played by Jet Li; action -- in one case, whip-wielding -- women) as well as its own attractions (I particularly like the idea of the pen as a real as well as metaphorical weapon).  All this having been said, it still seems to lack the extremes of and thus seem surprisingly tame compared to many another Hong Kong movie...which may explain why it is not a particular favorite of many Hong Kong movie fans.  On the other hand, for those (relatively) unused to the pace, gore and quick mood changes of so many movies from that part of the world, this would be recommended as a movie which showcases the imagination of Hong Kong movie makers and the ability -- in terms of quality but also range of possibility -- of its actors and actresses.",

Their talents are at their best in the nightclub scene where they effortlessly combine to nail the oleaginous crooner with a jury summons. Other than that, though, the movie kind of drags with scenes that try too hard (throwing Joan overboard from the yacht, the gangster stuff) alternating with scenes that are more weird/distasteful than quirky/funny (the wrestling sequence). And a little of Hugh Herbert, kind of a poor man&apos;s Ed Wynn, goes an awfully long way. Give it a C plus.",

      "name": "Highly engrossing Anthology effort",
      "reviewBody": "Several Indonesian folktales and scary stories are told through an anthology format.\n\nThe Good Stories: Incarnation of Naya-Heading off into the countryside, a mother and her daughter attempting to reconnect through a special ceremony stop off for a family get-together. When her intentions of seducing her long-lost cousin are inadvertently mixed up with the family&apos;s tradition of combating demons, she finds herself torn between the two worlds and must find a way of stopping it from continuing. This was quite an enjoyable and entertaining effort which has a lot going for it. Using the idea of her curiosity against their more traditional views is a solid starting point to use the ghostly haunting she soon undergoes, and once it turns out that she has interrupted the ceremony and forced the spirit world after her this one gets rather chilling. Those setups in the final half where the line between the spirit world and the real world offer some rather fun visuals, and this gives a lot of its positives from this style. There&apos;s not much about the purpose of their trip, but otherwise, there&apos;s some fun to be had here.\n\nPeeper-Continually spying on women, a peeping tom is coerced into following a dancer at a local stripshow who enjoys being watched. When his instincts get the better of him and he tries to spy on her against her knowledge, he finds himself in the grip of a deadly supernatural force and must find a way to get out. Though incredibly predictable, there&apos;s a lot to like with this entry as it&apos;s quite erotic and traditional-feeling than in most other stories. The premise of temptation and then having it turned around on them with a darkly comic twist of fate is quite an enjoyable tale which gets quite a lot of effective moments. The central dance for the gathered hordes is insanely erotic and works incredibly well, and although the final reveal is to be expected it&apos;s still really chilling. It&apos;s about the only thing wrong here.\n\nThe List-Awaking after a strange dream, a man finds himself and his girlfriend under attack by a series of strange mystical attacks from an unknown source. When the attacks continue, he finds that they&apos;re under attack by a black magic sorcerer&apos;s power under the direction of his ex-girlfriend and must find a way of stopping the attacks. This one here was quite the fun and enjoyable offering, as the whole segment is a constant source of fun black magic curses dished out through the helping of a list. With some rather traditional affairs including attack by insects and strange marks on the body, there&apos;s plenty of gory work to be done throughout here and some even manage quite a darkly comic bent with his insistent pleading and her appearing on a TV to torment him only to have him turn it off and forcing her to spend money to have the power to go through the turned-off set. The ending twist is a little convoluted and doesn&apos;t make much sense, but overall it&apos;s quite an enjoyable offering.\n\nThe Rescue-Following a deadly viral outbreak, a team of soldiers find themselves tasked with securing a small group of survivors from the ravenous horde of zombies now roaming the city. With their personal ticks making the mission even harder, they try to find a way through the city and away from the hordes alive. This was quite the enjoyable and utterly effective entry as the fact that the focus on the traditional slow-moving zombies targeting the soldiers works incredibly well in context against the other stories. With some frenetic attacks that are chilling and action-packed with the squad forcing the issue with plenty of gunfire, there&apos;s a lot of great action here alongside the great zombie make-up and brutal gore. Though it stumbles with a hokey sociopolitical message at the end that feels tacked on due to the storyline, there&apos;s quite a lot to really like with this one.\n\nThe Bad Story: Show Unit-Following a series of strange break-ins, a man rushing to protect his home accidentally kills the younger sister of his girlfriend. Attempting to hide the incident from her pushes him into far more graphic and gruesome actions in order to keep it hidden, only for much worse situations to come once her body disappears. Frankly, there&apos;s very little about this one that reads as horror beyond the actual incident itself which is quite tragic. Tragic doesn&apos;t equate to horrific, though, and a great deal of what transpires from his having to kill off others to keep it secret or finding the mail messed with don&apos;t register as all that scary. Beyond the brutality of the kills, there&apos;s little of this one with any interest.\n\nDara-Consumed with violent impulses, a chief manages to keep her shockingly dark and disturbing ingredients for her meals a secret from all who attend her restaurant. When one threatens to get away, she resorts to violent and intense action to keep it safely hidden away from others. Although there&apos;s a lot to like here, it&apos;s also shockingly flawed in that the central activity is kept to a minimum which is what really works here. The scenes of her chasing after the escaped victim or forced to extremely graphic and gruesome dismemberment in order to keep her secret make for quite a fun time here, but very little of elsewhere is enjoyable. With a great deal of time spent on preparations or just dull chatter about what&apos;s going on, very little of it is interesting other than the fact of seeing the incredibly gorgeous woman on-screen engaging in these acts. Beyond that, not a lot really happens here.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",

And all those who loved the film will love the books even more. Probably there will come a sequel next year and I already look forward to it.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the film last night. It started out like a typical &quot;Survival Horror&quot; film. A group of different people. A mysterious stranger rolls into town. All Hell (excuse me...HEAVEN) breaks loose. Then just as soon as the film got going, someone stabbed a pitchfork in it and turned it over. It totally changed gears.\n\nOnce the film first set-piece ended it turned into a slower version of Night of the Living Dead. This is largely due to a plot point that set this rule into action: God put a restraining order on all ZombAngels. They were not allowed to get too close to the main protagonist. So without giving anything away; you can now imagine the pacing of the film up to the climax. Slow and uneventful.\n\nThe acting was a caliber above most Horror films. Quaid, Black, and Bettany were all fine. However none were memorable. Even the two main Godsends, Gabriel and Michael, managed to have conflict that was forgotten seconds after the next scene started.\n\nSo I would say it&apos;s a &quot;Catch on Cable&quot; viewing. Unless you&apos;re a huge Bettany fan. Then I would say avoid this like the plague.",

Dark comedy about a writer who wants to become world-famous by leaving his village and his family and going to Brussels.  I like his conservative father who is regularly drunk and his aunt who proclaims a big future for him. His sexual initiation at a camping with the movies of Laurel and Hardy at the background is a bad start for him! The movie changes of tone in the second part and becomes more bitter.  You can still laugh with the many sketches in which the main actor staggers between self-indulgence and self-critical spot.  Splendid photography.",

I&apos;m a MAJOR Musical Theater fan, but I&apos;ve never been much of a &apos;Rent-head&apos;, (I find the story a bit pretentious and self aware - basically a modern version of &quot;Hair&quot;) - yet the emotion and energy is real and infectious, fueled by an incredible and memorable score.\n\nAs I remember, though, both the songs &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Love&quot; were NOT in the final cut I saw last night (11/6), but the interview with the cast and director was inspirational!\n\nThe best factor for me was that Director Columbus made a decision to shoot it AS A MUSICAL and not try to hide it&apos;s musical theater roots (like say, &quot;Chicago&quot;). Also, he cast many members of the original cast (a throwback to old movie musicals). These were brave and successful moves, and should finally knock down that door to MORE movie musicals.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

Low budget, silly script, bad dialogue, uneven acting, gimmicky to the extreme (with or without &quot;percepto&quot;), but it STILL manages to amaze. It&apos;s a kind of trojan horse, being a cheesy b-grade thriller with a hidden core of surrealism almost worthy of Bunuel or Cocteau.\n\n Memorable performances from horror legend Vincent Price as the scientist obsessed with explaining the strange phenomenon he labels &quot;the tingler&quot;, and Judith Evelyn (who had a bit part in Hitchcock&apos;s &apos;Rear Window&apos;) as a bizarre deaf mute who owns a silent movie theatre, elevate this above most of Castle&apos;s overrated output. The classic acid trip scene (I think the first ever), the memorable short colour sequence, and the William Burroughs-like monster make this something really special. Not to be missed!"

      "reviewBody": "Despite my love of Angelina Jolie, I must say that Taking Lives wasted a lot of good opportunity.\n\nGiven that they invented an entirely new lead character, we can&apos;t really compare this to the book, so let&apos;s look at it as a movie of it&apos;s own right.\n\nJolie plays Illeana Scott, a somewhat strange FBI agent who is called up to Canada to investigate the grisly murders of several young men, all whom have had their identities stolen by the killer. New to the scene is witness James Costa, Ethan Hawke, who soon grows to have an attachment to Scott.\n\nAt turns formulaic and down right rip off (the credits are far too similar to be called a homage to SE7EN), Taking Lives is a very enjoyable piece of work.\n\nBeautifully shot, the film wallows in its moods. It knows that it can be creepy, but it wears it out on its sleeves.\n\nAngelina is on top form as Scott, although its a shame that the movie does stoop to the need for quick-sex-scene-with-unnecessary-titty-shot.\n\nEthan Hawke is bearable as Costa, although he and Jolie have very little chemistry.\n\nOther players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Hughes-Angalade are also quite good.\n\nThe film does have its highs: excellent cinematography, creepy sinister mood, two fantastic adrenaline-jump moments that I never saw coming. But it also has one FATAL flaw, and that is that anyone who has seen any piece of film or television before will be able to guess who the killer is. Still, a fun movie nevertheless.\n\n7/10 If you get the chance to see it in the cinema, watch people&apos;s reactions to the &apos;scissors-scene&apos;. I was amazed to see hoe genuinely horrified even the most hardened viewers in my cinema were.",

Just about the same territory is covered in Derick Martini&apos;s Lymelife, only this time the metaphors seem forced, the characters less developed, and the denouement less ambiguous. \n\nLymelife, however, is a quality addition to the deconstruction of the American dream. It&apos;s 1979 America, and Mickey Bartlett (Alec Baldwin) has a burgeoning business developing upscale homes on Long Island. His family life is in decline as witnessed by 15 year old central character Jimmy Bartlett (Kieran Culkin), the only one whose prospects with babe next door, Adrianna Bragg (Emma Roberts), get better with each of his endearing humiliations. Mickey is a philanderer (he is played by Baldwin, after all), a spendthrift, and family neglecter, all of which must be addressed by the film&apos;s ambitious albeit incomplete plot.\n\nThe story moves gently but inexorably to a strong conclusion, where things seem to settle into their appointed fates, more an affirmation that American life between here and American Beauty hasn&apos;t changed much with its defeats and victories abundant. While Lymelife (a reference to the disease present in Long Island and a cumbersome metaphor) gains no new insights about our materialism and sexual exploration, it does present a true look at a time when this American life might have been more complicated than it is now."

Devlin, an American agent who employs the assistance of Alicia Huberman, (Ingrid Bergman) a German expatriate whose father has just been convicted as a German spy.  Devlin brings Alicia to Brazil in hopes to arrange a meeting with Alex Sebastian (the fantastic Claude Rains); another German spy who just happens to have a history with Alicia insofar that he was in love with her.  The plan is to get them together so that she can spy on Sebastian and his colleagues so that the Americans can get a leg up on their mutual espionage.  Of course, love develops between Devlin and Alicia, which complicates their operation and of course, their lives.\n\n `Notorious&apos;, despite adhering to the chaste Hayes Code of the time has some of the steamiest scenes between two actors that I can recall during that era.  While the scenes never get beyond the standard close-ups of their kisses, the chemistry is a heavy physical presence.  The acting in `Notorious&apos; is top-notch; Grant and Bergman were at their best during this era.  Claude Rains, who is a personal favorite of mine, is absolutely fabulous in this film.  He gives his character, who should be hateful, a humanistic quality that makes him an even more complicated figure. Screenwriter Ben Hecht and Hitchcock team up for some pretty intense moments in `Notorious&apos;, and compliment each others styles and talents wonderfully. There are not many nail-biting moments in `Notorious&apos;, but the script is excellent.  Coupled with the superior acting and direction, `Notorious&apos; is certainly a Hitchcock film that should not be missed. \n\n --Shelly",

Also it was free on a channel I have cause it was older:), but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Not an Oscar winner or anything but very well done story about a man blind since a young child, who went through some unpleasant treatments to help him regain his sight that didn&apos;t work. Now an adult, very used to being blind, he meets a young woman whom he likes, and she likes him too. She hears about a new surgery to help him regain his vision and wants him to try it, but his sister, who has been there for him his whole life helping him survive the sighted world, objects. His father left the family early on, and hasn&apos;t been in contact with him at all! He has to adjust his life drastically, and the movie shows all the pitfalls of suddenly seeing things and not always knowing what to do.It was pretty well acted, I thought, and made me want to find out more about the real man. All in all, well worth watching.",

Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, &quot;God&apos;s lonely man,&quot; continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it&apos;s hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader&apos;s fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.",

She is very strong and brave, though she is always put in difficult situations to have to take care her father in law, who seized with Alzheimer&apos;s desease. At first she was treated badly by him in everyday life, but finally he seemes to trust deeply her rather than his own relatives. I think, but for her support to the family,there would have only been collapse in the family. Anyway this movie is one of my most favorite ones.",

The girl contestant, Sawsan, is from a Muslim immigrant family, and she is not allowed to participate, but her efficient initiative works things out eagerly supported by a boy, Karl, moving from another culturally marginalized group of people in the province and into a metropolis school with an immigrant majority of pupils. It is an interesting fresh alliance between members of these different ethnic groups, and one of the humorous scenes is actually when the parents on their way to track down the fugitives agree upon the notion, that young people are allowed to do much more today than is good for them. In some way the song contest proves them wrong. Martin Miehe-Renard has mostly worked for television and directed installments of family film series, but here he tries something extra and he manages to steer clear of the obvious traps of political correctness sustained by his action filled cinematography and the most convincing immigrant girl staling the show.",

For months she has been living alone with her son, and she misses sex and the presence of a man with her. Paulina has a chance when she meets Stanislaus (Piotr Lysak), a young Polish POW. They have an affair and they fall in love for each other. Their love is denounced to the Gestapo and in accordance with the German laws, the prisoner is convicted to death by hanging, and Paulina sent to a labor camp. \n\nThis beautiful and tragic love story has a great narrative. It simultaneously happens in 1983 and 1943, in a parallel between the main story and the search of the middle-aged son of Pauline for the true story of his family in the present days (1983). The direction of Andrzei Wajda is perfect as usual. The change of period along the development of the story is very interesting, since many scenes happen at the same location, and we just note the changing of time because of the costumes. The romance is beautiful and shows common German people from a small town oppressed by the economical situation of a country in war, repressed by their own laws and behavior of their society, with feelings of love, envy, greed, friendship, trying to live and survive in a hard period of their history. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Um Amor na Alemanha&apos; (&apos;A Love In Germany&apos;)",

      "reviewBody": "I must be one of the few, it seems, who enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. I have been an X-fan for many years and my expectations were still met by this film. Do I think that it could have been a bit better? Certainly. The script seemed to pack too many elements into a short running time. With those issues solved I believe that it would have been fantastic. Still, I felt that X-3 was almost on the level with X-2&apos;s greatness. It has taken another viewing and some time to reach this point. At first, I felt betrayed at the many liberties taken with story elements. But after I left the theatre, I could not shake the feeling that I needed to view it again. After the second time, I came to grips with the film and now like it quite a bit. \n\nContrary to some critics&apos; reviews, I do not believe that X-3 became overshadowed by action. There really is quite little of it until the finale, which feels quite epic. There are excellent character moments sprinkled throughout. The acting is generally superb across the board. More Ian McKellen is always nice, and Hugh Jackman impresses again with Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar actually does a respectable job with Beast. The other characters all do well with what they are given. There are a few poorly written one-liners that reminded me of the ones in X-Men 1, but the script is mostly intelligent with powerful themes such as the Cure. Another difficulty is that the film cannot pay the proper amount of attention to the many characters, including the new ones. But they still all seem to contribute something to the larger plot movement in the film. Ratner&apos;s only obvious difference from Singer is his frenetic pacing and energy. X-3 really moves quickly, and this does not have to be a negative. I also enjoyed the emotion that was hinted at in X-2, and came into full force during X-3. I do not think that it reached sentimentality or was melodramatic; it really felt powerful. The stakes really do seem to be high for the final chapter of this trilogy. The viewer finds this out quickly concerning Cyclops and Mystique, later with Jean and Xavier (in a particularly awe-inspiring scene), and during the finale in a nice moment with Jean and Wolverine. I think that many of the problems people are seeing in the film resulted from the pressure the entire production team was placed under in order to develop and finish the entire film in less than a year. \n\nBut all in all, I have really come to enjoy it as a satisfying film that met my high expectations. Look at it this way if you must. Try to see X-3 as not a stand-alone film but more as the third portion of one large story. The first X-Men had the difficult job of introducing a large ensemble cast of mutants and establishing a story and tone (other superhero films with one primary character have it much easier). X-2 had the most enviable position as most of the characters had already been partly developed and it did not have to conclude the entire story. It could work mostly on its own, just having to leave threads open for the next one. X-3 had the extremely difficult task of closing out the entire trilogy for good. I see it more as the third portion of one expansive tale, thus in the larger scheme it must move quickly toward a complete conclusion. In my opinion, the many actors under the abrupt switch in direction did an x-cellent job.",

From her teenage days in a school for poor noble young ladies to her near accession to the throne of Russia, she showed utter and complete love and devotion for the Tsar Alexander II.\n\n What is particularly well depicted in this movie is the waiting. Katia and Alexander spend hours, days, years sometimes, waiting to see each other again. And each second of waiting renders their love stronger. The whole movie is based on some kind of patience/impatience duality. Alexander begs Katia to be patient but the terrorists feel anything but patience against the regime. They want reform now, they want the tsar out, with everything he represents, now. They are a light of impatience in a country that is still trapped in laws and traditions of the middle ages.",

It&apos;s in color and widescreen, not that that adds much... the original film didn&apos;t have great cinematography, but the more claustrophobic frame gave it a little extra tension. Also, they swapped out a black stereotype for a Mexican stereotype. I guess that&apos;s supposed to be progress. Other than that, it really is practically identical to the original. The major difference, of course, is casting. I like Jack Palance, but he doesn&apos;t have the world-weariness or charm of Bogart. Likewise, I&apos;m very fond of Shelley Winters, but what she does best is playing pathetic, and this character can&apos;t be pathetic. You just end up wanting Palance to ditch her. I don&apos;t want to be too harsh on this film, though. It&apos;s just that I felt like I&apos;d already seen it (twice, even) and the update doesn&apos;t do any real updating. A competent but pointless endeavor, stick with Bogart and Lupino.",

The plan involves explosives a traffic jam, a football match and a load of mini coopers.\n\nI watched this recently on TV  it was shown the night before England played Argentina in World Cup 2002 (1-0, Argentina then dropped put in the first round!).  The reason it was shown was simply that it&apos;s strength is that it&apos;s a good caper movie where the Brits go over there and put one over on the Italians!  It may smack of zenophobia but that&apos;s what it is!\n\nThe criminals even go so far as to use Mini&apos;s for the job  in the most famous scene of the film, making them cool for decades!  The reason it was shown before the game was just to feed on the fact that national pride was high.  Even if you ignore the British element (the song `self preservation society&apos; is now even a football anthem) then it&apos;s still quite fun to watch. The build up to the job is breezy and funny with good lines, while the job itself is fanciful but great fun.\n\nThe ending must be known to everyone  but it&apos;s still good no matter how many times you see it!  The cast are all good  with a range of British TV faces in there bringing a distinct British comedy.  Caine is great, as are Coward and Hill but the real stars are the Mini&apos;s and the daring comedic race across Turin.\n\nOverall this is not a great film  but it is a classic caper movie.  It&apos;s made even better by the fact that it makes you proud to be British in a weird way!  Say it with me my friends  `hang on lads, I&apos;ve got an idea..&apos;"

      "reviewBody": "Tommy Wirkola sure knows how to make a zombie film! Not only does he reference many classic zombie films, but in turn he makes his own unique spin on the zombie tale and he does it well. The plot has striking resemblance to many slashers, as it starts off with a group of medical students taking a ski vacation. However, it takes a turn with random when Nazi Zombies decide to ruin their fun in order to take back their stolen treasures. Dead Snow has many things going for it apart from its odd story; it is well written and directed, all the actors are very good and the gore levels are extremely high and rival almost every modern zombie flick.\n\nIt goes to show that foreign horror (especially European) is loads better than most American trash released. This film comes from Norway and is a shining example. Simple in its execution, with a group of like-able characters, a witty script and much disemboweling and de-limbing, Dead Snow is one of the year&apos;s best horror films and should make its way into many Top lists soon enough.\n\n4/5",

Our wiki friends inform us that &quot;The film has no plot in the conventional sense of the word. The chronology of the film is disjointed..... It uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of tenuously related scenes.&quot; Sound familiar? Chien was essentially a student film but one might say that it has had some staying power.\n\nI liked Kaboom but it was certainly a bit silly, especially toward the end. About as silly as a lobster telephone. And if characters were continually waking out of dreams (and being interrupted during &quot;spanking&quot; sessions), perhaps that was a hint to the viewer about where the film was coming from.....",

      "reviewBody": "If I were to compare this movie to another I would say that it is sort of like a cross between &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Patch Adams&quot;. Granted it is not as good as Nest was, however it is not nearly as horrid as &quot;Patch Adams&quot; so I say it is closer to Cuckoo&apos;s Nest than the other. I mainly compare it to Patch as the two lead gentlemen in this film have a terminal illness and they try to cope with it and do so in a humorous way at times. They are thankfully spared someone who is perfectly fine telling jokes and making light of the situation. The film is about two terminally ill guys who are in a hospital in I believe London. One is an American and the other does seem to be a resident of London. At first the American is kind of down in the dumps, but the other guy named Bancroft and played by Dalton tries to get him to loosen up. At one point he even wheels him onto the roof of the building. They both finally get out of the hospitals clutches and proceed to live life to the fullest with the little time they have left. On the way to their final destination, a brothel in Amsterdam, they come across two ladies whom they attach to and the four begin to have fun. Unfortunately, the American&apos;s illness does seem to be taking hold of him fast and so there is not the happiest of endings to this one. However, it is not all that sad either.",

Story: a 10 year-old girl (Bergthora Aradottir as &apos;Sofie&apos;) realises that her father is not abroad, as her mother has always told her, but simply has left her mother and lives with another woman. She decides to look him up and confront him, with the help from her best friend (Freydis Kristofersdottir as &apos;Yrsa&apos;). This leads to complications such as the kidnapping of Sofie&apos;s half-sister. This movie is exciting, the story doesn&apos;t leave you bungling somewhere. Every time you think, where do we go from here?, the director takes you along some path which seems logical but not predictable. The two main characters play their parts exceedingly well, with Aradottir as the doubting and sensitive one yearning for recognition and Kristofersdottir as the more streetwise(-ish) tomboy. Real emotions are displayed and the drama is never too thick. It&apos;s quite amazing how well these children act. There&apos;s more balance between Aradottir and Kristofersdottir than for example in a comparable film like &quot;Selma and Johanna&quot; (Sweden, 1997), where it is sort of lacking. The movie is quite realistic, it is only unrealistic in the fact that it IS a movie, for children at that. Only at the end one gets the feeling that they ran out money or time.",

      "reviewBody": "The famous and invaluable diamond known as the Pink Panther is stolen once again from the museum in Lugash, and the authorities decide immediately that to effect the return of this National Treasure they must seek the help of the one man they know will bring the needed expertise to the case: Clouseau.  And so it is that `The Return Of The Pink Panther&apos; is entrusted to none other than the inimitable Inspector (Peter Sellers) from France, much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who, knowing what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of, would like nothing more than to be rid of him once and for all.  But such a request from the sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied, and Clouseau is therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash, with orders to bring the criminals to justice, and insure that the case is indeed-- to quote Clouseau-- `solv-ed.&apos; \tSome ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had teamed up for the brilliant film `A Shot In The Dark,&apos; before coming together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures of the `belov-ed&apos; Inspector Clouseau.  But the wait was certainly worth it. Cleverly written and delivered, it affords Sellers ample opportunities to do what he does best:  Make you laugh.  Whether affecting an alias in disguise or forthrightly confronting the usual suspects, Clouseau deftly uncovers every `ploy&apos; attempted by the unscrupulous thieves he seeks.  There are moments so hilarious that even co-star Catherine Schell (Claudine) has trouble keeping a straight face at times; but rather than being a distraction (as you&apos;d think it would be), it somehow makes it even funnier. And it&apos;s a great example of why this movie is so good, and why it works so well.  Simply put, it&apos;s fun.  Edwards has a formula for success that begins with having a good story at the core, an excellent supporting cast to flesh it all out, then mixing it all together with the main ingredient which is, of course, Sellers.  It&apos;s one that works, and of which directors of some of the more recent fare being proffered as `comedy&apos; could benefit. \tChristopher Plummer is well cast as debonair master thief Sir Charles Litton, bringing an air of sophistication to the film that contrasts so well with the antics of Sellers.  Characters returning after debuting in `A Shot In The Dark&apos; include the terrific Lom, whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the perfect foil for Clouseau; Andre Maranne (Francois); and of course Burt Kwouk as Clouseau&apos;s ever-attacking manservant, Cato.  The scenes between Sellers and Kwouk, in which they spar at Clouseau&apos;s house, are a riot, as is the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film (or the series, for that matter); Lom&apos;s `reactions&apos; alone to what Sellers is doing are classic bits of comedy. \tRounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne (Colonel Sharky), Peter Jeffrey (General Wadafi), Gregoire Aslan (Chief of Lugash Police), Victor Spinetti (Hotel Concierge) and John Bluthal (Blind Beggar).  A number of elements go into making a comedy work, and `The Return Of The Pink Panther&apos; has them all, but most especially, Peter Sellers, who without a doubt is one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  His comedy works because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally from the situation at hand; there&apos;s never a laugh that is forced or false. Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau, walking a beat, questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to beg, all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed. There&apos;s a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch; the kind of film you can see over and over again and never get tired of.  One of the great things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up this film-- as well as the other `Panther&apos; movies-- at will.  For a lot of laughs, take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers and discover what `classic&apos; comedy is all about.  It never gets old, and somehow just keeps getting better with age.  I rate this one 9/10.",

      "name": "As excellent and accurate a film of the Balanchine production as could be made, despite Macaulay Culkin",
      "reviewBody": "Those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated George Balanchine production live onstage, or are letting their disdain for the star casting of Macaulay Culkin influence their judgement. The Atlanta Ballet was fortunate enough, from the 1960&apos;s to the 1980&apos;s, to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the New York City Ballet, and I have seen it live onstage several times. I can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production, and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase Culkin; it was Balanchine&apos;s idea to use a child in this role, just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of Marie. The &quot;heavy&quot; dancing is left to the adults in the story.\n\nThis is deliberately a stagebound film; in a way, it resembles Laurence Olivier&apos;s &quot;Othello&quot;. Exactly as in that film, the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage, but not made any less artificial, and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups, and without the distracting &quot;music video&quot; quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated Maurice Sendak-Carroll Ballard version. There are only two false steps in this 1993 film. One is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects (mouse squeaks, the children whispering &quot;Ma-gic!&quot; to Drosselmeyer,etc.). Those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any &quot;Nutcracker&quot;, and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on film.\n\nThe other false step is Macaulay Culkin&apos;s nutcracker make-up, which looks absolutely ridiculous. When he is on screen as the Nutcracker, rather than wearing a huge mask (as is always done when the Balanchine production is performed onstage), Culkin is actually made up as the toy - he wears what looks like a bald cap, as well as a white wig, whiskers, and a beard. He also has his face rouged up somewhat, and the worst aspect of his make-up is that it is still recognizably his face, amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr&apos;s makeups in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (that film&apos;s makeup results though, worked spectacularly, as this one&apos;s does not). And a comparison with Baryshnikov&apos;s nutcracker in *his* production shows how wonderfully creative Baryshnikov&apos;s nutcracker mask was - the &quot;jaws&quot; actually seemed to move whenever Baryshnikov tilted his head back.\n\nThe dancing itself in the Macaulay Culkin version is excellent, of course, except for Culkin himself, whose dancing, as I said, isn&apos;t meant to even be spectacular. (The Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in Balanchine&apos;s production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.) The film&apos;s colors, though, could be a bit brighter since this IS a fantasy. The choreography is also brilliant, and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from Tchaikovsky&apos;s ballet &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; - as Marie sneaks downstairs, falls asleep on the sofa, and dreams that Drosselmeyer is &quot;repairing&quot; the broken Nutcracker (this sequence was, of course, never included in Tchaikovsky&apos;s original ballet---it is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;).\n\nThose who have missed out on this film, or those who despise (or loathe it) should give it a chance, despite its two big drawbacks. It is far better than it seems when one first hears that Culkin is in it.",

      "reviewBody": "FRAKTUS is a Mockumentary about the Reunion of an 80&apos;s Elektro-Pop-Band that resembles KRAFTWERK quite a bit. One could call it a German version of &quot;this is Spinal Tap&quot;. Sounds dull? No, really, you should give it a chance -- This is one of the frustratingly rare gems of German comedy! \n\nOnly two other German feature film comedies (that I know of) come to mind which worked as fine as this one: Loriot&apos;s &quot;Papa ante Portas&quot; and Helge Schneider&apos;s &quot;Texas&quot;. FRAKTUS could be located right in the middle between those two very different films, because the former is a work of almost mathematically crafted comedy and the latter a spontaneous collage of improvised scenes. FRAKTUS is a mixture of those approaches, and miraculously it all blends together in the most hilarious way.\n\nThe Movie was written and the Band Members are played by a German Trio of Radio-Comedians/Novelists/Actors/Singer-Songwriters and what not called &quot;Studio Braun&quot;. Those Guys are mostly just called Comedians, but in Germany that comes close to an insult. One could better describe them as all-round-Artists of the Unexpected and the Psychedelic. They don&apos;t seem to care about making an audience laugh, they even dare to be hated (and by many they are!). So everything they&apos;ve done so far is quite the opposite of mainstream comedy.\n\nI don&apos;t know how the movie works with subtitles, but also for a non-German audience there should be much to enjoy. The Soundtrack itself is a work of genius. It&apos;s crafted so well that it singlehandedly tells the story of a band&apos;s journey from experimental music to pure remix- crap. The huge amount of mock artwork, album covers, Tour Posters, Photos etc. featured throughout the film also deserve credit for being a spot-on emulation of the early 80&apos;s underground style. But the biggest achievement of the movie is the portrayal of the three main characters, which seems to happen casually but is all the more effective. Needless to say they&apos;re all not very likable. They can&apos;t stand each other but try to overcome that for what they think is the greater good. And that maybe is the most German thing about the movie.\n\nTo sum it up: FRAKTUS is one of those movies I will frequently re-watch for the rest of my life! I strongly advise you to go see it!\n\n9/10",

      "name": "Joan Crawford Analyzes the Missing Link; Plus Cutie Kim Braden",
      "reviewBody": "This 1970 British flick mingles elements of &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and various Sasquatch tales. The scenes where Joan studies Trog are like an inversion of the scenes in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; where the female doctor chimp (Zira) analyzes Charlton Heston. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; comes to mind because of the fairly sympathetic portrayal of the half-man/half-ape and his gentle treatment of a little girl. Being a low-budget English film directed by Freddie Francis it has a decidedly Hammer-esque look and vibe.\n\nSome have mocked the film as &quot;campy&quot; but this simply isn&apos;t true; the story is played completely straight. Nothing about it is consciously artificial, exaggerated or self-parodying, like, say, Alan Rickman&apos;s performance in 1991&apos;s &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.&quot; THAT&apos;s campy.\n\nThe ape make-up is similar to that of &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; albeit with a more protruding maw. In fact, it looks like someone dug the ape mask out of the trash from the set of 1968&apos;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (which they probably did!)\n\nThis was Joan Crawford&apos;s final film and has been heavily panned. I don&apos;t understand this because it&apos;s not really THAT bad. As a matter of fact, the material is taken serious by all involved as the story tackles the question: What would it be like if the so-called missing link was actually discovered ALIVE? Of course, you have to take into account that the perspective of the movie is 1969, when it was shot. Given the period and the low budget, the movie has its limitations, which can be witnessed in two glaring ways:\n\n(1) The overlong dinosaur sequence of stock stop-motion footage that I assume are images from Trog&apos;s memory; and (2) the appearance of Trog himself. In regards to the latter, the head and facial features of the ape-man look quite good for 1969, it&apos;s the rest that leaves much to be desired. Basically, Trog is just a small-ish white dude walking around in a loin cloth and fur &quot;tennis shoes&quot; with what looks like a short fur cape. This is the extent of the Trog costume and it looks lame, which is probably why people mock the film -- the &quot;monster&quot; is more laughable than fearsome.\n\nUpon reflection, though, since Trog is half-human and therefore mostly hairless, it makes sense that he would obtain furs to make rudimentary clothing for warmth warm. This assumes, of course, that he&apos;d have to occasionally leave the caverns to kill animals for furs; and likely food as well (after all, what would he eat in the darkness of the caves?). Since he&apos;s half-human he would have the intelligence to do this.\n\nWhat makes &quot;Trog&quot; an essential purchase, besides being Crawford&apos;s last film, is the stunning Kim Braden, who plays Joan&apos;s daughter/assistant, Anne. Kim is fully clothed at all times, usually wearing cute short-skirt/dress outfits, proving that attractiveness is more than a matter of showing skin. What a cutie! Interestingly, Kim went on to play Captain Picard&apos;s wife in the Nexus in the outstanding 1994 film &quot;Star Trek: Generations.&quot;\n\nThe film runs 93 minutes and was shot in Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nGRADE: C+",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been a fan of Charles Napier ever since seeing Russ Meyer&apos;s CHERRY, HARRY, AND RAQUEL at a drive-in circa 1973. After appearing in COP TARGET with Robert Ginty for director Umberto Lenzi, Napier got a chance to star in HIS OWN euro-crime film for Lenzi, and this film MEAN TRICKS is it. What a treat it is to see Napier beat the crap out of various punks and mouth great b-movie crime dialogue that sounds like it could have come from one of the later Mike Shayne novels. No one can get as many syllables out of the word &quot;Bu**s**t&quot; as Napier can. This has the flat, euro-TV-movie look of many later Lenzi films, but the man knows how to make an unpretentious genre film that delivers the goods. If the idea of Charles Napier as a hard-drinking, tough-talking crimebuster with a bad attitude is appealing to you, DO seek out this gem of a film. It&apos;s Napier at his best!",

There are a lot of scenes and parts which make no sense whatsoever. But at no point is it ever boring. So it is highly watchable despite being a piece of crap. If you be a fan of the MK franchise or are expecting a good movie, watch it to see how bad a movie can get, just for education. It does however take a special kind of talent to ruin a franchise and movie which already has a good plot in place (refer to the MK video games). This movie&apos;s entire cast and crew have that talent and so does a retard called Paul Anderson.",

Dirch Passers character, Gudmund, is based on a mix between the personalities of the owners of the two biggest travels agencies of the time in Denmark: Eilif Kroager (who was indeed a priest) of Tjæreborg travels and Simon Spies (a flamboyant playboy) of Spies travels. The movie is quite short (76 min) so you don&apos;t get to tired of the silly storyline. Also Else-Marie Hansen has a nice performance as a cigar smoking, fernet branca drinking, ministry of ecclesiastical affairs official.",

      "name": "Too long and the straight/generic telling doesn&apos;t really work with the complex motivations and moralities of the characters",
      "reviewBody": "Based on a true story, Killer Elite sees a hired assassin called back into duty when his mentor is held hostage by a powerful sheik who wants revenge on the SAS men who killed his sons. Danny takes the job in order to get Hunter released – a job that involves getting the men to confess on camera before killing them in such a way that it looks like an accident and cannot be traced back. However the targets are a paranoid bunch and once a few questions are asked and one of the men dies, the secretive group behind the deaths put former soldier Spike onto the case, pitting the two trained killers against each other.\n\nThis film feels like a missed opportunity and more must have been hoped for it – not least by the relatively big name stars that were involved. This is a tale of murky secrets, covert actions overseas, trained killers and the influence of money and power – it should be much more interesting that it is here, but the decision appears to have been taken to make it as a straight generic thriller. This isn&apos;t really a problem in terms of some of the action because there are &quot;good bits&quot; in here, the problem comes from the fact that the material actually doesn&apos;t lend itself to this approach as much as you would have liked. So, for example, this sort of generic thriller really suits simple characters, simple plots and thumping action scenes but instead Killer Elite hands us with two groups, neither of whom are particularly &quot;likeable&quot;, so the genre approach tells the viewer to root for the good guy – but the plot gives us no clue as to who this is. I have no issue with murky and unlikeable characters, the problem is that the delivery of the film doesn&apos;t do anything with it and tries to force it all into a mould that it doesn&apos;t fit.\n\nFortunately the more dramatic sequences are still pretty good (not great, but good) and they come up reasonably often to allow the film to temporarily be the film it wants to be. Not often enough though, and all of them are damaged by the fact that the rest of the film around them isn&apos;t working as well – and there is a lot of &quot;other film&quot;, too much in fact and it runs a good twenty minutes longer than it can cope with. Much like with the recent film Blitz, Statham does his thing well – whether it suits the film or not. He delivers what you expect him to and again maybe he is part of the reason the film is pushed to be something it is not. Owen appears to be more in touch with what the material should be and also does well with the mano-a-mano stuff that the film asks of him, but it is hard to watch him delivering on a complexity that the finished film had no interest in. De Niro is a solid presence because of who he is, but he is really phoning this in. Akinnuoye-Agbaje only has a small role but, as a fan of Oz who knows how good he can be, it is always good to see him in things.\n\nThere is a good story in Killer Elite but unfortunately all but the bullet points is lost in a telling that is trying to make more of a standard thriller and doesn&apos;t seem able or willing to do anything with the murky aspects of plot or characters. The end result is a so-so thriller with a so-so plot and performances that mostly don&apos;t really work. I wonder at what point in the production they started making it something it wasn&apos;t, but regardless when it happened, it did seem to happen and it is a shame because the story deserved to be told better than it was here."

Warren hadn&apos;t made a movie for ten years before &quot;Charro&quot; and I think he shouldn&apos;t have been producer, writer AND director. He did his weakest job as the writer, his directing is a lot better, but I wonder what Peckinpah might have done out of this story. In fact the two-former-friends-now-enemies plot is typical for Peckinpah. The story reflects a lot of Elvis&apos; own career, most obvious: the bad guy in &quot;Charro&quot; USES the Elvis character to make money, which is exactly what Elvis&apos; real life manager did, too, in fact that guy (who called himself Colonel, although he wasn&apos;t) was highly unscrupulous and Elvis too weak (sorry fellow fans but let&apos;s face the truth!) to have his own way. This often underrated movie is highly recommendable to anyone who likes western movies. Let me add that this movie is NOT a musical; in one scene Elvis is opening a door to look into a saloon where a band is playing, in one of his awful musical comedies, the man would jump onto the stage and perform some tune, but here he turns around and closes the door.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently viewed this film from 1959 and was totally riveted to it. Directed by Jack Clayton, it is a timeless love story set in post-war Britain with the incomparable Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey at the centre of the storm. The background highlights the struggle between class and ambition in 1950&apos;s Britain. Laurence Harvey plays Joe Lampton, the &quot;angry young man&quot; who is motivated to make something of himself in a world that he is not comfortable with. Harvey portrays a new kid on the block who has taken a job at city hall, where he works with other young men like himself. He and his buddies remind us of randy high school students discovering the world and women all at once.\n\nWhile Joe shows all the aptitudes necessary for advancement, he is a man of principle who inherits the hostility of the working class that flares up when provoked by snide remarks about where he came from. He has trouble playing the game but no trouble attracting the attention of the ladies. At first attracted to the daughter of a local tycoon, he knows that he is an outsider and seeks the advice and friendship of an older woman - the genuine and magnetic Signoret, who plays the lovelorn wife of a local businessman and philanderer. Over time, he falls deeply in love with the older woman and the time they spend alone provides some of the most compelling scenes you are likely to find in the cinema of the 1950&apos;s. After successfully wooing her, he runs headlong into the realities of life, leading to a gut-wrenching climax, which you won&apos;t forget.",

      "name": "Well made period drama with an intimate feel, not an epic love story",
      "reviewBody": "I agree with one reviewer that the original title in German (either &quot;Blood Mountain&quot; or, I&apos;m thinking, &quot;Mountain Blood&quot;) is more fitting to the narrative and theme than &quot;The Holy Land of Tyrol,&quot; a concept that is mentioned once, in the opening voice-over, and seems a mistranslation of the notion of the Biblical &quot;Promised Land.&quot; The title in English could mislead the viewer into thinking this is a religious film, which it is not. The people depicted are Catholic and pray the rosary, but they&apos;re also farming, cooking, doctoring, partying (after early success in the rebellion).\n\nThe Bavarian Katharina is a doctor&apos;s daughter in the city of Augsburg who falls in love with a Tyrolean carpenter named Franz and flees with him to his family home in the Alps after a fight with a French soldier of Napoleon&apos;s occupation makes him a wanted man. Her inexplicable fortitude and courage to stay on this poor mountaintop farm in the face of Franz&apos;s unwelcoming brothers and parents, particularly an antagonizing mother-in-law, becomes the focus of the film early on. Katharina grew up educated, with servants, with nice clothes, in a lovely home, and hasn&apos;t the slightest notion of how to milk a cow, decant the vinegar, or even how to efficiently slice the potatoes. In Hollywood this might have been played for laughs, but here the unsympathetic matriarch not only shows her no kindness, but consistently chastises her. In town Katharina is also despised because of her nationality—her only ally being the parish priest, himself a Bavarian transplant. Her emotional isolation is complete when Franz leaves with his younger brother Veit to serve as sharp-shooters in the Tyrolean rebellion.\n\nKatharina proves helpful at nursing Franz&apos;s ailing father back to health after a gunshot wound and increases her knowledge of folk healing arts working alongside Franz&apos;s older brother Hermann, a country doctor of sorts who eventually enlists her help in the town&apos;s makeshift infirmary for war-wounded. Battles themselves happen off-screen, and the viewer is spared amputations and other gore, while the bloody aprons and bandages establish the facts. The characters&apos; story eventually intersects with that of rebel leader Andreas Hofer, a historical figure who espouses the population&apos;s desire for self-determination and the choice to stop running. But it&apos;s not preachy; there&apos;s no eloquent oratory; no supernatural heroics; and no perfect characters in this film. Katharina rebukes the Tyroleans who refuse her help, pointing out their stupidity and the futility of their out-manned, outclassed struggle. She wins and loses the affections of her in-laws during the course of the story. Without giving away any spoilers, her marriage has its own ups and downs.\n\nI&apos;m trying to brush up on my German, so I found this film included with Amazon Prime. I noticed the English subtitles are effective translations, and the dialogue is not wordy, so it shouldn&apos;t be too off-putting for people who have little tolerance for &quot;reading&quot; their movies. It&apos;s more about country life and a personal story, carried largely by facial expressions, characters&apos; behaviors, and production design, than it is about any sort of details of the war and the political demarcations that were in flux in that era. It&apos;s not a pretty period piece but rather a gritty portrait of crude living that does not at the same time belabor the tribulations of trying to farm that impossible landscape—it&apos;s not a farming movie; it&apos;s not a war movie; I wouldn&apos;t even say it&apos;s a love story per se, because we don&apos;t really know much about Katharina and Franz&apos;s courtship and why they&apos;re devoted to each other. Still, I was strangely enchanted by this film, and it&apos;s certainly a glimpse of one slice of the Napoleon era that I&apos;ve never seen anywhere else.",

      "description": "It is spring 1809. KatharinaÂ’s Tyrolean husband, Franz, is arguing with a French soldier in AugsburgÂ’s marketplace. It ends with the soldier dead by accident and the young couple fleeing the city for FranzÂ’s homeland.\r\n\r\nEven on the way it&apos;s obvious that the mood in the Alpine land is at breaking point. Bavaria and France, which have occupied the Tyrol for years, are despised, which doesn&apos;t guarantee the Bavarian Katharina the warmest of welcomes. She soon misses the warmth and comfort of her family in Augsburg. After so many years away from home, Franz is quickly caught up in the enthusiasm of the independence movement around Andreas Hofer. He calls the Tyrolean farmers to rise up. Before long, Franz marches with his younger brother off to war, leaving Katharina at home.\r\n\r\nReliant for the first time only on herself, Katharina undergoes hard times until, finally, she masters the tasks at hands and wins the villagersÂ’ respect.\r\n\r\nAgainst all the odds, the Tyroleans return victorious from their battles. The villagers celebrate. Only Katharina and the village priest recognise that although the night belongs to them, a lasting victory is impossible. Forced to make a decision, Katharina decides to render Franz unfit for battle. But he discovers her plan, their relationship shatters and Katharina is expelled from the farm.",

      "reviewBody": "The Beast With Five Fingers predates any other disembodied&apos; hand film I&apos;ve seen by a good twenty years.  Such films include Dr. Terror&apos;s House Of Horror, The Hand, Evil Dead II, Severed Ties, and the two Addam&apos;s Family films and television series.  This selection illustrates the gamut of horror film quality, from the delightful Evil Dead II to the atrocious Severed Ties.  Happily, their precursor, The Beast With Five Fingers is hands down&apos; one of the better entries in this sub-genre.\n\nThe Beast is set in an Italian village, home of the successful pianist, Francis Ingram, who resides in a sumptuous villa.  Ingram is wheelchair bound as his entire right side is paralysed, and is forced to play piano using his single left hand.  His style is suitably heavy and melancholic. He is a haunted figure, heavily reliant on his young nurse to the point of obsession, and fixated on his own death.  Therefore, he summons his companions to dinner to witness the signing of his will.  Amongst them is his personal secretary Hilary (Peter Lorre), a man with his own obsessions; astrology and the occult.  It is not long before the Grim Reaper arrives as a belated dinner guest.\n\nThe film&apos;s most prominent actor is Peter Lorre.  Lorre&apos;s career in horror fare has seen a slight regression over the years, though not as profound as some of his contemporaries such as Bela Lugosi and John Carradine.  In the Thirties, Lorre starred in Fritz Lang&apos;s classic M and the rather good Mad Love.  However, by the Sixties he was resigned to playing second fiddle to Vincent Price in horror-comedies The Comedy Of Terrors and The Raven.  These two films are reasonable enough but eclipsed by his formative work.  The Beast makes a fitting mid-point between these two eras.\n\nLorre is an engaging actor, his childlike physique and strange manner always invoke some degree of viewer sympathy no matter how heinous his crimes (cf. M).  J. Carrol Naish who plays the affable police inspector (yep, never heard of him before) is also notable but his more comedic moments do lessen the film&apos;s impact.\n\nThe special effects used to animate the hand are impressive for their time, although as the film is in b&amp;w this helps mask its inadequacies somewhat. The rubber hand in Dr. Terror&apos;s House Of Horror is pitiable in comparison, and that was made twenty odd years later.  The interplay between Lorre and the hand as he alternatively soothes and struggles with it are reminiscent of Ash&apos;s plight in Evil Dead II.\n\n*spoliers*\n\nThe majority of the players seem primarily motivated by avarice.  It is somewhat surprising then that the final bodycount is so low.  A modern horror would have casually knocked off such sinners&apos; with glee.  Perhaps, this highlights a rift between vintage&apos; and modern horror.  The vintage film has a more human approach to its characters, although they do suffer in terms of danger and scares, they do not die.  The usual modern approach is to emphasise the killings, the characters are just fodder for the killer&apos;s and the audience&apos;s whimsy.  Of course this reasoning parallels the change in audience expectation and tolerance with time, and also what the changes the filmmakers could get away with in terms of censorship and decency&apos;."

It was a great memory as a child, watching this magical film and singing the songs. I realize that not everyone is a fan of musicals or Disney films in general, but this was one of the last true musicals, up there with Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.\n\nI like the original, it has depth and feeling. Remakes just make me feel like I&apos;m paying for a story I already know. Some remakes can be good, but the original Petes Dragon isn&apos;t even that old of a film. And I know Disney has a history of remaking a lot of their own films, but Petes Dragon? It&apos;s a classic.\n\nThis film has so many memorable moments, from the characters to the sets to the music. Mickey Rooney as Lampie was great, probably his most remembered role ever. And Helen Reddy as Nora was excellent, and her song Candle on the Water is beautiful. And Doc Terminus, played by Jim Dale was hilarious and charming. He is a real treat to watch in any Disney film.\n\nIf you love Disney films, watch the classic and give it credit where it&apos;s due.",

The idea has been borrowed into stuff like The Stream, V/H/S etc. here they take the idea and instead mix it with the backdrop of the K-pop and music industry and it works really well in this case. The music segments are well filmed too. Whereas those movies often real &quot;fake&quot; because the premise is kind of ridiculous if you think about it setting it to a more real world scenario leaves it more fulfilling.",

      "reviewBody": "Print and sound are horrible. Marilyn Miller is charismatic. Her horse-like dance number at a stable is awesome. Sunny was a Broadway hit, with a run of 517 shows, but they took out most of the musical numbers for the film, as movie musicals had become unpopular in the late 1920s.\n\nThis is the second of three films starring Miller, who was a huge star on Broadway in the 1920s as Ziegfeld Follies&apos; lead actress. Miller only lived to be 37.\n\nThis film desperately needs to be restored. It could be a pretty good film. Although the story is pedestrian, some of the scenes are funny, although much of the humor is buried in poor sound quality. The film features early Vitaphone audio, which synchronized record albums with film. This can make restoration a particular challenge. The records were fragile and were only meant to be played a few times before they were replaced. If the discs are gone, what&apos;s left is whatever dub was made onto film long ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is a personal project for Emma Thompson, starring and writing both the 2005 original and this sequel. She has an obvious love for this children&apos;s franchise and the novels of Christianna Brand. Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang was met with almost universal critical acclaim upon its initial release in the UK.\n\nIsabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a stressed out mother to Norman (Asa Butterfield), Megsie (Lil Wood) and Vincent (Oscar). Her husband (Ewan McGregor) is fighting in the Second World War and the family farm is suffering financial troubles. When Isabel&apos;s spoilt brat nephew and niece, Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) arrive from London they clash with her hardy county children: it is clear Isabel needs help. Luckily Nanny McPhee (Thompson) comes to disciple the children, teach them important life lessons and help save the farm from being sold by the dastardly Uncle Phil (Rhys Ifans).\n\nNanny Mcphee and the Big Bang is clearly aimed for young children and director Susanna White (who is known for television work on Bleak House and Generation Kill) attempts to keep a childish, playful tone throughout the film. This is shown in some of the set designs, like the pig scratchier, and the use of CGI animals. Many of the set pieces in the film felt like being from a cartoon. Young children will enjoy this sequel and there are strong moral messages such as working together and learning to share which parents will want to encourage. Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is perfectly light and fluffy for boys and girls. The humour of the film is aimed at a young audience, focusing on poo and burping gags and general slapstick, which makes it harder to appeal to teens and adults. The children do grow as characters and slowly become more likable with Thompson and White looking beyond the stereotypes. Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is a very British, quaint family film with it period, rural setting. This film is also the type of sequel where you do not need or any knowledge of the previous film. Yet the plot is basically a cross between Mary Poppins and a standard plot of someone trying to take property from the rightful owner through sabotage. Plus the filmmakers did not try hard enough to allow adults to enjoy the film as much as children would. Less poo gags and more swimming pigs for next time is my advice.\n\nThompson obviously enjoys her role and she did well in her performance as a hard but fair magical woman with a dead-pan delivery. She knows exactly what she wants to do as Nanny McPhee. Gyllenhaal offers a good performance and pulls off a decent English accent. Despite the over-the-top nature of the film, Gyllenhaal plays her character straight as a mother who is simply snowed under. The rest of the main cast are caricatures, with the child actors showing promise. But other performances did not fit well, like Sam Kelly as the Air Warrant. There are some cameos from big name actors like Ralph Fiennes and McGregor to smaller name actors like Bill Bailey, a talented comedian who is best known to American as the desk sergeant in Hot Fuzz. He was quite funny as a stereotypical farmer.",

      "reviewBody": "A young boy grows to fulfill his murdered father&apos;s vision of seeing THE IRON HORSE, the mighty transcontinental railway, stitch the country together, binding East to West.\n\nBursting with excitement &amp; patriotic fervor, THE IRON HORSE is the film which put young director John Ford on the cinematic map. He brought together all he had learned from years of making shorter, smaller films and he produced a product which heralded his enormous contributions to sound films in the years to come. This is a `director&apos;s picture&apos; in that the stars, as good as they are, are almost negligible; what was important here was Ford&apos;s vision &amp; his ability to place it before the audience. Indeed, he does not even bring his leading man (George O&apos;Brien) on screen until 45 minutes into the story - a shortcut to disaster almost anywhere else.\n\n(In all fairness it should be noted that O&apos;Brien, handsome &amp; strong-limbed, does very well as the gentle hero. He would find similar roles in other epic films of the decade. J. Farrell MacDonald, as Irish Corporal Casey, is the prototype for many comically eccentric fellows who would appear in other Ford westerns.)\n\nThe film often takes on the aspects of an ancient newsreel. Cattle drives, Indian attacks &amp; endless track laying all look utterly real. Particularly fascinating is the depiction of the dismantlement of the end-of-the-track town, so that not even a dog is left, as it is moved many miles further on to the west. This type of arcane information is what makes watching very old films so enjoyable.\n\nTHE IRON HORSE represented the largest migration out of Hollywood for location shooting up to that time. Nothing like this had been attempted before, so Ford &amp; his lieutenants were forced to make up the rules as they went along.\n\nHiring a circus train, the small army of extras arrived at the subzero Nevada location in January of 1924. The conditions which greeted them were authentically primitive. It was so cold, the extras quickly began sleeping in their costumes. Finding the train to be flea ridden, they moved into the sets and began living exactly as the characters they were portraying. The female extras especially suffered from the rugged conditions. A frontier mindset seemed to take over many of the cast &amp; crew; the circus tent, which doubled as both the movie saloon and the crew&apos;s commissary, eventually had to have the catsup bottles removed from the tables to discourage the many fights which kept breaking out.\n\nAuthenticity found its way into the movie in other, more positive, ways. Several of the elderly Chinese extras, representing laborers on the Central Pacific, had actually worked on the real McCoy sixty years previous. They came out of retirement to appear in the film &amp; enjoyed themselves immensely. Ford also managed to locate the two original locomotives which met at Promontory Point, Utah, in 1869 and reunited them for the film&apos;s climax.\n\nComposer John Lanchbery has contributed a splendid soundtrack to the restored video version, incorporating several contemporaneous tunes of the period. It would be intriguing to double bill THE IRON HORSE with Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s UNION PACIFIC (1939), which tells the same historical story, but with a completely different tack &amp; set of fictional characters.",

I find it hard to believe that it could be enjoyed outside of the MST3K universe.I found the dialouge contrived and, along with situational elements, often forced.Still, I do hope there will be a Boggy Creek 3 so that some nagging questions may stand a chance of being answered. Why couldn&apos;t Tim keep his shirt on? Exactly why did the professor drag the girls along with him? Why did a retired lawyer of all people have an outhouse? Did someone actually part with hard earned money so this film could be made? Why is it I feel less intelligent after having seen this movie? Why? Why? Why?"

I watched this with no expectations and to my surprise thought it was actually pretty decent suspense thriller. No, it&apos;s not a great movie, but it&apos;s a perfect Rental that will keep you entertained. The acting is actually pretty good. Cage and Jones do an alright job, but Pearce really did a good job as the villain in the film. I thought a movie like this would be predictable, but the film actually goes in a bit of a different direction than you would expect it to. However, the movie fell flat in it&apos;s third act when it substituted all of it&apos;s suspense for action and a somewhat disappointing ending. Still, even though it&apos;s not a great movie and has it&apos;s flaws, Seeking Justice is still a decent thriller perfect for a rental that is better than you would probably expect. Even if you don&apos;t care for it, you still can easily admit that it&apos;s better than any of Cage&apos;s other recent films.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the years, Hungarian director István Szabó has become famous for films like &quot;Mephisto&quot; (about a man who sells himself to the Nazis for status) and &quot;Sunshine&quot; (about three generations of a Jewish-Hungarian family). One of his early movies was &quot;Apa&quot; (&quot;Father&quot; in English), about Tako, a boy in post-war Hungary. Tako&apos;s father is dead, and Tako likes to think that his father died heroically fighting the Nazis. But as Tako ages, he starts to question whether or not that&apos;s the whole story, and is determined to find out.\n\nAlong with this, &quot;Father&quot; looks at the changes that the Magyar Republic underwent after the war. An example is the school&apos;s renaming: previously St. Benedict&apos;s School, the pro-Soviet government renames it State School. In that sense, I would say that the movie plays a role similar to &quot;I vitelloni&quot; by Federico Fellini and &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; by Kon Ichikawa, since they looked at the new directions that Italy and Japan were taking, respectively, and how they were having to deal with what happened during WWII. Hungary also had to do this, although it really had to follow the Soviet Union.\n\nEither way, &quot;Apa&quot; is certainly a formidable piece of cinema history. Definitely one of which the people of Magyarország can be proud. Isten, áldd meg a magyart!",

Their fighting scenes are all done by them no stunt double. If get the blue ray you get see the behind the scenes. I won&apos;t give out spoilers like many have. This is NOT for young kids under 13. There is some swearing and the fighting is blood nothing kids 13 and older has not heard of from others. Honestly these kids if keep doing fighting like this when get older then would definitely be the next Tony Jaa.",

Waters is now no longer a simple schlockmeister, but instead a persevering, entrepreneurial, visionary.  The film, once labeled as a exercise in bad taste, is now a major point of influence for many of today&apos;s filmmakers (Jarmusch, Hartley, etc). Of course PINK FLAMINGOES is a fantastic movie and it&apos;s director and star very interesting people, but they&apos;ve been interviewed a lot and some of this seems very repetitive. The real find here is the behind the scenes footage of the cult classic. The nervous, sick look on Divine&apos;s face as they get ready to film the dog pooping scene is simply unforgettable.  Also has a exclusive interview with the man who did the infamous singing ass----. Overall fun for John Waters fans, but don&apos;t expect any major revelations. Major discrepancy on running times.  On the video jacket it says 96 minutes, on the cassette it says 105 minutes, but the actual running time is really 90 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "To make Freaky Friday work perfectly; you would have to believe that Jamie Lee Curtis is Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan is Jamie Lee Curtis. Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it&apos;s the only other family movie out there.\n\nTess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) (changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers) is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen (Lohan) (changed from Annabel Andrews) is supposed to be a typical teenager (but is anything but), and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) (changed from Ben Andrews). Tess is going to marry Ryan (Harmon), because her husband died three years ago (can&apos;t there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive?), of whom Anna doesn&apos;t approve. After a fueled feud, Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies: Tess is in Anna&apos;s body, and vice versa. Whatever will be done?\n\nAlthough most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen (although with the people at my school, what she does is anything but typical), and she should be, Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that&apos;s rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.\n\nOne part of Freaky Friday that I didn&apos;t like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn&apos;t seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform? Not only were they awkward, they were just not believable. On the other hand, Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments, but is also quite touching at times. Obviously, it was going to be, and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other, considering it was shown in the trailer.\n\nOne other part I didn&apos;t like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on Anna-as-Tess (Annabel-as-Ellen), and how she spent her day. Of course, back then she was a housewife, but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it, unlike others, which is basically watching the book. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90-minute diverter. It won&apos;t change your life, but you won&apos;t be upset you saw it.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nRated PG for mild thematic elements and some language.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. Mihail (Felix Lajko) has saved his money in the city to return to the village where his mother (Lili Monori) lives with her boyfriend (Sandor Gaspar) and his half sister Fauna (Orsolya Toth). Mihail sets out to build a house on the river delta on land his father owned. Fauna helps Mihail with the construction and lives in a hut with him while the construction his under way. The villagers consider Mihail an outsider and are opposed to the idea of a half brother and sister living alone together. Writer/director Kornel Mandruczo in a script co-written by Yvette Biro offers this rural tale of a developing incestuous relationship in a film beautifully shot by cinematographer Matyas Erdely and superbly edited by David Jancso. The film looks so good that every scene is a virtual painting but the storyline is a little weak with underdeveloped characters, weak dialog and a plodding pace. This perhaps may have worked better as a 20 minute short film but stretched out into a feature with little background on the characters and village life weakens it. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "This 50 minute documentary was made in 1969 (just after director Ken Loach completed Kes) but was viewed publicly for the first time in 2011. It was jointly funded by the UK&apos;s London Weekend Television and UK-based charity Save the Children, as a document on their work. Ken Loach remembers a screening with Save the Children when people walked out - though he can&apos;t remember if he was there. Producer Tony Garnett remembers a screening with LWT executives as the most uncomfortable hour of his professional life. The film became embroiled in a legal battle that nearly bankrupted the fledgling Kestrel Films. Although Save the Children wanted all traces of the film destroyed ultimately a compromise was agreed where a single print of the film (without titles, credits etc) would be given to the British Film Institute archive until such a time as the charity felt comfortable with it being shown. It took over 40 years and their continuing discomfort with the film was evident in the face of the charity&apos;s CEO, Justin Forsyth, who had come along to discuss it after the 2011 screening to a packed auditorium at the BFI. When challenged by Garnett, Forsyth conceded through gritted teeth that Save the Children would not object to the film being shown on TV, but immediately raised other problems with broadcasting the film, rather contradicting what he&apos;d said earlier about the importance of having the debates raised by the film more widely.\n\nSo what caused so much fuss? The film argues that Save the Children&apos;s work with poor children in Kenya and with urban working-class children in England is part of a wider project of aid and charity which serves to salve the consciences of the white middle-classes while keeping in place the conditions that lead to poverty. According to the film, any solution must address the underlying economic causes of inequality and deprivation and not just through fair trade or debt cancellation but through the overthrow of capitalism. The film&apos;s language of socialist revolution is one that is no longer part of our public vocabulary. However, the issues raised are still relevant - how ex colonial powers keep Africa in a position of debt and dependence, as a space that can service their needs, and how the middle-classes present their own way of life (and of parenting in particular) as the solution to social deprivation. This film is worth seeing alone for the directness of its politics. John Pilger and Michael Moore make some great, angry documentaries but nothing like this.",

Furthermore,Lamarr is ably seconded by then newcomer Gloria Franklin as another gentle victim of the Saigon love game.And can Miss Franklin handle a heartbreaking rhythm. Why did America fail to take this delicate chanteuse to its heart?\n\nThe main flaw in this work,which otherwise would deserve a nine or ten rating, is the casting of an already hardening Robert Taylor as the enraptured playboy.It is patent,considering the obvious parallels with &quot;Camille, why Taylor was hired. He even goes through some almost identical motions a second time in the death scene here. And that is exactly the problem.Taylor has left romanticism behind him by the time this film was shot. His best notes here are quiet desperation. Francis Lederer would have been great for the role(remember him with Louise Brooks?),but, under the Hollywood casting system ,there was no chance he could have gotten the part.\n\nFlawed as it is, it is flawless Lamarr.And as every romantic believes ,there must still be audiences of unknowing lovers out there who will want to see it again-and again.",

Cox was wonderful! Her performance in this movie made a fan out of me. I cannot wait for her next dramatic role. The story, the directing, the cinematography as well as the acting are superb.

Being merciless in the beginning (he even buries one villain alive!), meeting a beautiful young widow (Michele Girardon) and her son makes him slowly change his mind. His obsession with revenge (the camera just loves to make close-ups of Mike Marshall&apos;s steel-blue eyes staring wildly) gradually fades away. Especially when he finds out that one of the villains he has hunted has become a monk because he regretted his deeds. Will Shane be able to forgive?\n\nAt first this seems like an average revenge western among a thousand others, but it stands out from the crowd by a slightly more thoughtful attitude of director Fizzarotti, whose only western this is. Revenge isn&apos;t just a natural way of life (or rather, death), it is questionable sometimes. Also the movie has an interesting cast. You may recognize one familiar face, Spartaco Conversi, from &apos;Once Upon A Time In the West&apos; among the bandits, for example. Voted 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fairly forgotten gem from the mid-80s, based on the classic and tragic novel of the same name. The film is also the legendary John Huston&apos;s third last movie as a director. Taking place in Mexico during the festival known as the Day of the Dead, the film also works against a backdrop of the early days of WWII, and explores the fragmented love triangle between a former British diplomat (Albert Finney), his estranged wife (Jacqueline Bisset), and his adventurous journalist brother (Anthony Andrews).\n\nUnder the Volcano starts out slowly, following the corpse-like wandering of retired diplomat Geoffrey Firmin as he explores the Day of the Dead and seeks out booze to feed his alcoholism. We&apos;re given various clues as to what has left him in such a sodden and rambling state, and we learn that his wife divorced him from abroad. Geoffrey proceeds to drink himself into oblivion, and into the fray enters his erstwhile wife Yvonne... testing the waters as it were for a possible reconciliation. Geoffrey&apos;s brother Hugh, recently returned from the Spanish civil war, is at a loss as to where he fits in with regards to their relationship, and also in regards to the world itself. The three decide to take a day trip out of town, with Yvonne and Hugh unsure of where Geoffrey&apos;s health and state of mind will literally lead them.\n\nThis film is a rambling, elegaic swansong to suntouched dreams fortified by alcohol. These three people try to outrun their demons and replace their mistakes with hollow new plans - Yvonne hopes to start her life anew, but Geoffrey&apos;s disgracefully drunken state makes him an unpredictable quantity to bank on, especially in regards to whether he can forgive her for the adultery that left him in such a state. Geoffrey tells a story at one point about a colonial named Blackstone, a man who turned native and disliked the puritans who tried to save him so much that he simply just disappeared into the wilderness. There&apos;s obviously something about this story that appeals to Geoffrey as he seems to identify with Blackstone so much that he later tells strangers that it&apos;s his name, and you can&apos;t help but feel that this is the only solution to the problems at hand that he can truly grasp at. Bubbling underneath the surface of the film all this time is a slowly building sense of doom highlighted by the coming of WWII, the ominous woodwind score, and the film&apos;s title itself. Geoffrey alludes to a horrific war story at several points, drawing comparisons with the 30s horror film Mad Love (referred to here as The Hands of Orlac) with his belief that &quot;Some things you can&apos;t apologise for&quot;, and this quote echoes throughout the film whenever the main characters are forced to come face to face with each other&apos;s mistakes.\n\nThis won&apos;t be a film to everyone&apos;s taste, it starts out as something approaching a travel-drama but kind of mutates into outright tragedy in it&apos;s second half. At the core of Under the Volcano is a staggering performance from Albert Finney as the drunken diplomat. Finney was more than rightfully nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for his realistic depiction of the life of a hopeless drunk... full of whimsy and cheer and rambling anecdotes, treading a fine line between absolute tankdom and lucidness, and tapping into all kinds of ambivalent emotions that would be far too challenging to a less complex and accomplished actor. Too often the drunk in film is shown as either a figure for comedy, fear or tragedy, but never are they shown as realistically as Finney&apos;s characterisation here. I could see shades of every pathetic and hilarious drunk I&apos;ve ever met at a pub or a party in Under the Volcano&apos;s Geoffrey Firmin, and the film makes no compromises whatsoever in showing this for what it is. One of the best performances in film.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: There&apos;s nothing quite like a sinister Mexican dwarf grinning while he makes obscene gestures with his hands. I found this bit to be quite offputting and creepy.",

Alas, an educated Barthelmess causes political trouble for his fatherly employer.\n\nBarthelmess is really too old to be playing a school-age kid. The costume, lighting, and make-up do not hide the strain. Fortunately, Barthelmess, a fine actor, would follow this with some more suitable roles, like &quot;Heroes for Sale&quot; (1933). &quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot; has good direction (by Michael Curtiz), an interesting story, and a finely-wizened supporting cast. Barthelmess&apos; leading ladies are sweet Dorothy Jordan (as Betty Wright) and sassy Bette Davis (as Madge Norwood). Ms. Davis, who delivers the memorable line, &quot;I&apos;d like to kiss ya, but I just washed my hair,&quot; is outstanding.\n\n***** The Cabin in the Cotton (10/15/32) Michael Curtiz ~ Richard Barthelmess, Bette Davis, Dorothy Jordan, Berton Churchill",

      "name": "SECRET SERVICE OF THE IMPERIAL COURT - Worthy Shaw Bros. effort",
      "reviewBody": "SECRET SERVICE OF THE IMPERIAL COURT (1984) was one of the last kung fu/swordplay films to be made at Hong Kong&apos;s Shaw Bros. studio. Set in the Ming Dynasty, it makes excellent use of the studio&apos;s vast array of sprawling sets and colorful costumes to give a real period flavor. It has a good cast, lots of large-scale fight action and an exciting storyline about a conflict between an honorable officer and a corrupt Eunuch.\n\nLongtime kung fu stalwart Leung Kar Yan (LEGEND OF A FIGHTER) plays Zhao Bufa, a sergeant of the Imperial Guards who runs afoul of Eunuch Wang (Liu Yung) when he objects to the Eunuch&apos;s attempt to have a group of honest officers executed on false charges of treason. Eunuch Wang has become all-powerful since taking over the affairs of state by keeping the young, decadent Emperor supplied with a steady stream of nubile, eager-to-please young women (glimpsed in a rather surprising nude scene at the palace). Bufa&apos;s stance puts his father, Zhao Wuji (Ku Feng), the Captain of the Brocade Guards, in an extremely difficult position, forcing him to order his son&apos;s capture and execution, even though he knows the Eunuch is wrong, or else his entire clan will be wiped out. Zhao Bufa escapes with his wife and young son to join the rest of the Zhao Clan at their sprawling country estate. When the clan learns the full extent of the situation, Zhao Bufa must go on the run again as he is forced to fight family and foe alike.\n\nZhao Bufa is a bit different from most kung fu heroes in that he&apos;s quite the family man and dotes on his adorable young son, &quot;Dingdong,&quot; and his beautiful wife (Nancy Hu Guan Zhen). Late in the film, there is even a &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; element (borrowing from the Japanese manga/film series of that title) to the father-son relationship. This is evidently a strategy on the part of the script to increase our sympathy for the hero after we see him, early in the film, training the guards in an extremely brutal fashion and ordering them to kill prisoners viciously and without hesitation as part of a program to make the guards utterly merciless.\n\nEverything seems a bit more pumped up than usual for a Shaw Bros. kung fu film. The editing is tight, scenes are cut short and unnecessary action is eliminated, enabling the story to move forward at a rapid pace. The fight scenes are under-cranked a little to speed the combat up as characters plunge furiously into swordfights, slashing and banging swords ferociously. As a result, it all ends in a tidy 86 minutes and leaves us feeling just a little hungry for more, especially since the grand finale between Zhao Bufa and Eunuch Wang seems a bit rushed. There&apos;s far more wire work in this scene than in the rest of the film as Bufa and Wang fly around the set completely unrestrained. It&apos;s possible that the film&apos;s fight choreography was perhaps influenced by the nonstop, sped-up action in Tsui Hark&apos;s new wave &quot;wire-fu&quot; spectacle of the year before, ZU: WARRIORS FROM THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN.\n\n Overall, it&apos;s a fun movie that has good-looking production values and benefits from a fine cast including the aforementioned Leung Kar Yan and Ku Feng, as well as such kung fu greats as Lo Lieh as Zhao Bufa&apos;s uncle, Jason Pai Piao as one of the righteous officers, and Philip Ko Fei as the Eunuch&apos;s chief enforcer. In addition, two of the Shaw studio&apos;s famous Five Venoms, Lo Meng and Sun Chien, are on hand in smaller parts.\n\nThis title is among the many Shaw Bros. films newly released in 2003 on DVD by Celestial Pictures in remastered, restored, letter-boxed, subtitled editions."

      "reviewBody": "I still remember seeing this film at movie theaters way back when I was a lad. Of course I didn&apos;t hear very much of it due to all the shrieks and squeals from the teenage girls in the audience over Frankie Avalon. That curiously enough didn&apos;t matter because Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a very visual film.\n\nIt might seem a little old hat today, but we&apos;ve been through two more generations that have seen the United States Navy become an atomic fleet of submarines and surface carriers. It was only seven years earlier, in 1955 that the U.S.S. Nautilus was launched as our first atomic submarine. In homage to that wonderful visionary Jules Verne who foresaw atomic power one hundred years earlier the Navy named it after that famous undersea ship of Verne&apos;s great novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The nuclear submarine was a wondrous thing in 1961.\n\nThe idea of a nuclear power submarine was the brainchild of Admiral Hyman Rickover. Rickover was a tough minded s.o.b. who usually got whatever he wanted by any mean necessary including bullying. Hard to believe that the gentlemanly Walter Pigeon could play him, but he did and well as Admiral Harry Nelson, the ersatz Rickover. \n\nWhat&apos;s happened here is that the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds the Earth has caught fire and temperatures are climbing all over the world. The planet is doomed, but Walter Pigeon&apos;s got an idea to save it. Fire a missile and seed the belt with more radiation, kind of a nuclear backfire and the blaze will end.\n\nA lot of people are telling him it won&apos;t work, but Pigeon brushes them all aside. The only two who have faith in him are his assistants played by Peter Lorre and Barbara Eden. But our intrepid admiral pushes through. \n\nOf course the U.S.S. Seaview encounters all kinds of obstacles along the way, but that&apos;s the rest of the story.\n\nThe cast does very well for itself and young Frankie Avalon as a junior officer comes off rather nicely. Frankie sings over the title credits, but during the movie plays a trumpet. Avalon in fact was a trumpet virtuoso and a singing career was an afterthought. The fickle finger of fate.\n\nVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea still a nice science fiction adventure even though it is dated.",

      "reviewBody": "The title may not be alluring. In fact, &quot;Kitchen Stories&quot; could be misleading to some that it&apos;d be more of a women movie. Far from it - though it all may have started with the &apos;dazzling&apos; multi-tetrahedrons of a chart that the self-satisfied scientist boasts of demonstrating findings on women&apos;s activity traffic in a kitchen. The snappy music sets me quite at ease in spite of anticipating reading subtitles - the melodic and light drum beats, chorus behind main vocal, sax/trumpet/trombone sounds - it&apos;s easy swinging tunes, indeed. The official site from filmsdulosange.fr gives you a feel of the 50&apos;s and a sampling of the jingle-like jazzy tune.\n\n&quot;Kitchen Stories&quot; is an absolutely delightful piece. It&apos;s about a meticulously organized scientific research in the &apos;50&apos;s on studying the kitchen behavior of single Norwegian men by assigned researchers from Sweden, in the name of advancement, of course - to improve kitchen activity efficiency. Sounds awfully dry? How can watching two men watching each other be interesting? Ah, to the genius of director Bent Hamer, who co-wrote and co-produced with Jörgen Bergmark, the film is simple enjoyment and relaxing fun. It&apos;s the discerning humor of observing human behavior of all parties involved: neighbor and neighborhood doctor, researcher and target subject, boss man and his boss - it&apos;s a film to relish and bemused upon.\n\nHaving had graphic arts, any pattern catches my eye. The opening scene - the caravan of the nine trailers each with an interesting form seen at the top of the trailer presented quite an engaging sight. Towards the end, one would realize - ah, it&apos;s that indispensable high umpire chair! Truly a well-made film and down to earth charming in all its naturalness - yes, engaging even with all the &apos;silent,&apos; &apos;quiet,&apos; &apos;observing&apos; scenes - within and without the house.\n\nIt&apos;s also intriguing: what&apos;s happening elsewhere/upstairs while Folke Nilsson sat so quietly alone in the dark in that kitchen observation station of Isak&apos;s; what&apos;s Isak&apos;s thinking while he&apos;s piping; Grant the neighbor, what&apos;s he up to watching without a word in the cold darkness. And in the name of science, we are given insights to the &apos;body electric&apos; static radio tuning.what am I talking about? Ha, that&apos;s another smilingly amusing reason to enjoy &quot;Kitchen Stories.&quot; Thanks to the subtitles by Nick Norris, we get steady doses of chuckle and bemusing smiles throughout the film. The two main leads, Joachim Calmeyer as Isak and Tomas Norström as Folke, are fantastically &apos;wry&apos; in their own self-bemused way, complementing each other&apos;s performance.\n\nNot everything&apos;s indoors per se, there are impressive snowy landscapes, light of dawn and dead of night scenes by cinematographer Philip Øgaard. There&apos;s also a touching side story revolves around a faithful companion of a horse, and an anticipated red horse. It&apos;s full of little sprinkles of surprises and details, down to the specific food that Folke likes. Do enjoy this film. Bemused is the word repeatedly reinforced.",

I cant comment on the acting as I don&apos;t speak Korean, but rather relied on subtitles, but I can say that the low budget of this film had no adverse effects on the quality at all.\n\nThe best part of this this film is that although the characters are gay, the film would have been equally cohesive and interesting if the cast were changed to male/female heterosexual roles.\n\nI would recommend this film to any Indi film fan, GLBT film supporter and mainstream viewers alike. This is truly a film anyone could enjoy. Don&apos;t miss out!",

Not sure what is up with Rollin: he needs nude women, vampires, castles and a sea side with a fence (or dilapidated pier) in all his films...\n\nI think this one was probably the best of those I have seen. The rocking music, the actual attempt to have a back story for the vampires... it was like he decided that a plot would be nice, besides just the sex and stripped women. Good call, Jean."

      "name": "If you didn&apos;t laugh about it you&apos;d cry - so Burton wisely takes the route of weirdly dark comedy",
      "reviewBody": "Ed Wood is a frustrated actor and director who&apos;s small theatre productions barely can get a good word said about them.  When a cheap little production company advertises a project about sex change, Wood jumps at the chance and uses his personal fetish for women&apos;s clothing as the hook to get the job. Despite his final project being laughed out of the major studios, Wood now has the taste for it and starts to try and get funding to make his own films - aided by the ailing star Bela Lugosi who is desperate for work to help fund his habits.  With a collection of freaks and oddballs, Wood made what are now considered to be some of the worst films ever made.\n\nSome things in life are depressing and it is often the case that we try to look on the bright side and make jokes about the situation as an attempt to deal with it.  I&apos;m from Northern Ireland and my humour is quite dark and gallows style simply because that is the kind of comedy I grew up with was draw from the background of murder and violence - gallows humour is an appropriate term.  This film may not be based on gallows humour but it is such a potentially depressing story that the only way to do it and make it enjoyable is to tell it with humour.  Burton treats his subject with a great deal of affection and thus makes this film a funny tale of a dreamer who we know will never see his dreams fulfilled in the way he would like.  The story is funny but not in the cruel mocking way that it could have been but in a fanciful way that is amusing and all the better for being based on truth.  This strand continues all the way through the film and helps us to like Wood even if it is impossible to defend his films - the ending is perfectly upbeat considering that Wood then ended his life an alcoholic making cheap nude pictures.  The characters are exaggerated but still quite true to the real life people they represent (I take this from comments made in documentaries).\n\nAs director, Burton is excellent.  He gives the whole film an otherworldly feel that is very fitting for a tale that involves characters that are very weird indeed.  The affectionate approach that Burton has for Wood really helps - I wonder does he relate to the guy just trying to make the films that appeal to him or what it is that makes him feel this way towards him? Either way the end result is very good and it stands out as a film that is pretty much without flaw.  I questioned the film&apos;s inclusion in the imdb top 250 but then I thought well, what is wrong with it? I had to admit that almost nothing is wrong - the only thing would be that the story may not be to everyone&apos;s tastes and not everyone will buy into Burton&apos;s affectionate look at Wood.\n\nThe cast is led by a magnificent performance by Depp who I have long maintained is one of the finest actors (or at least bravest) of my generation.  Here he continues Burton&apos;s affectionate approach by portraying Wood as a man filled with hope and dreams - even doing a good job of turning cross dressing into an amusing quirk.  The cast is truly all star but they all do a great job playing their characters.  Landau&apos;s Oscar may have had a touch of sentimentality about it but it was still deserved - he plays Lugosi really well and manages the difficulties of his drug addiction really well to make him both amusing but deeply sympathetic.  The support cast includes good turns from Parker, Arquette (quite interchangeable really!), Jones, Murray, Starr, D&apos;Onofrio and Spradlin.  All the cast do well but it is those that play Wood&apos;s wooden cast members that do the best job - managing to do both natural performances outside of Wood&apos;s movie but also doing justice to just how bad their characters really were!\n\nOverall this is a great movie but the tale of a rubbish movie director who enjoys cross-dressing and hangs out with a group of weirdoes is likely not to be to everyone&apos;s taste.  Regardless of this, if it interests you then you should be pleased with a slick movie that takes an amusing and affectionate look at what is a fairly depressing story."

      "reviewBody": "Days of Our Lives in space is the best way in which to describe this dreary, laborious non-event. Intrepid reporter (Nutter) is granted access to a space station on which the crew are less than excited about his presence to the extent he quickly earns the nickname of &quot;Leech&quot;. Predictably, he becomes a burden in the name of any moral cause that emerges, causing conflict among the crew as they try to save the earth from oblivion.\n\nNutter made a very brief impression in films when we played Felix Leiter in the James Bond instalment &quot;Thunderball&quot;, but his acting leaves a lot to be desired, hampered further by the inane dialogue that leads him to compare the hot young female cosmonaut (Farion) to that of a mascot chimp that belonged to this father. Archie Savage and Franco Fantasia are the only other recognisable names in the cast playing chivalrous space heroes, while veteran spaghetti movie-maker Antonio Margheriti directs his second picture.\n\nA lot of goofy explanations and additional narrative is supplied via voice-over, while miniatures do their job at depicting outer space paraphernalia. The special effects are spectacularly infantile, but the plot thickens nicely and the tension almost makes palpable as the puerile dialogue pours on the sympathy like rivers of gravy over this proverbial turkey. But how can you not like a movie that features an actor by the name of &quot;Alain Dijon&quot;?",

When a member of their group dies afterward uploading a fictional tale of the poet on the internet, they now race to find out the truth before they will be hit next.\n\nThis movie is a typical and rather interesting mystery in sacks of historical facts and hearsay.

Well, its a fresh story I guess, about a filthy cop who must do undercover as a model to investigate about drugs trafficking around model. He suddenly bumped with his old classmate, now as his fashion designer Miss Go. Its sure have big potential but with a lot of nonsensical comedy and unnecessary action, we feel uneasy and fail to laugh. They surely can use the love story between Ji Hwan and Yu Ri to attract all audiences but they just make it very simple and unattractive. By the way I try to love this movie but I cant. Just can give it 5 because its so average and common korean comedy. What&apos;s fun from this movie is the car chasing scene which is different from other conventional car chasing that we always saw in a movie. If you want to know, just watch it!"

Assigned to the monumental backstage crime case simply because of his height, among the challenges Chul-soo faces is working with high school alum KO Young-jae, who happens to be the designer. Convinced he stinks and will ruin her show, she sets him the impossible task of shedding 20 kilograms in 2 weeks. He accepts the challenge but becoming a runway model means more than just losing weight. With so much to learn in such a short period of time, Chul-sooÂ’s case turns into the biggest Project Makeover of all time!",

      "reviewBody": "What a perfect film for insomniacs. This is wonderful to watch with the lights out. With that said, let&apos;s look at this underrated work by director Anthony Mann. First the obvious...John Alton is a genius.  The lighting, or lack thereof, is visually striking.  What this man could do with a $10 budget was simply amazing.  Secondly, let&apos;s note the unusual commentary/narration by Academy Award winner(she won the award that same year for her role in &quot;Key Largo&quot;), Claire Trevor.  I can count only a couple of film noir in which the voice-over is done by a doomed (in love)woman.  Her sense of entrapment perfectly encapsulate&apos;s the mood of this film. Now, let&apos;s also note the odd use of a theremin for the bulk of the music used in this film.  Check it out...very creepy.  But one of the most overlooked components in this film has to be the hulking visage of Raymond Burr.  This guy had to be in just about every film made between 1944 and 1960.  In this particular film he is a sado-masochistic pyromaniac.  In just about every scene he is torching somebody, whether it be by using his lighter, or throwing a flaming flambeaus at some poor unsuspecting party-going girl or by just burning down his own apartment. He&apos;s a nutcase...but a joy to watch on the screen.\n\nOkay, so the story itself isn&apos;t the most original.  But with everything else this film has going for it, I HIGHLY recommend anyone even slightly interested, to go buy it NOW!  It&apos;s one of my absolute favorite film noir&apos;s. Oh...I almost forgot.  Check out Marsha Hunt in this film.  She&apos;s stunning."

I remember them being quite witty and Iznogoud was a rather nasty person. Unfortunately I have to say, that what I saw, was not what I expected to see. It had some (very few) good moments. I saw some nice F/X but they alone don&apos;t make a good movie. As a resume I think it was not worth wasting 95 minutes of my time. Iznogoud was too young and too good looking and the caliph was too old. In my eyes the cast could have been way better. This is a good example of a bad result you get when trying to convert a cartoon into a live-action movie.",

The rest of the cast is strictly minor league level, though Vittorio Rossi is not bad as the artist caught up in a web of crime. A thoroughly reasonable way to spend 90 minutes in front of the tube.",

      "reviewBody": "In the year 1845 Doctor John Dolittle is an eccentric physician in the English village of Puddleby. (The picturesque village of Castle Combe, Wiltshire was the prime location, although through some special effects magic this inland village in a landlocked county has somehow acquired a seaport and coastline). He finds that he has a much greater rapport with animals than he does with his human patients, so he switches to veterinary medicine instead, a field in which he enjoys great success because of his unique ability to talk to animals. The story follows his adventures in the company of his friends Matthew Mugg (an Irish cats&apos;-meat salesman) and Tommy Stubbins (a young schoolboy) as they go in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail.\n\nHugh Lofting&apos;s &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; books were a great favourite of mine during my childhood, so I absolutely loved this film when my parents took the family to see it. Of course, I was then blissfully unaware that the film had been savaged by most of the critics, that it had been a box-office flop and that difficulties in production had meant that the costs massively overran the original budget. (The cost of the finished film was $17 million; only four years earlier that would have made it the most expensive film ever made). My sisters and I were not, however, alone in our love of the film; the Academy nominated it for a &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar, a nomination which at the time seemed incomprehensible to most people in the film world.\n\nSo how has &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; held up over the fifty-odd years since it was made? Well, I can now see its flaws in a way which I could not as a child, although it certainly has its good points. Rex Harrison makes an attractively charismatic hero, even though he bears little resemblance to the short, plump Dolittle of the books. As he had shown in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; he was not the world&apos;s greatest singer, but as in that film he manages to stroll his way through his songs, reciting rather than singing them. The first half of the film, set against some attractively photographed Wiltshire countryside and concentrating on Dolittle&apos;s dealings with his animal friends, is still enchanting.\n\nBricusse&apos;s songs are something of a mixed bag. Seeing the film again recently some of them, especially &quot;My Friend the Doctor&quot;, &quot;I&apos;ve Never Seen Anything Like It&quot; and, of course, &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot;, took me instantly back to the world of my childhood. Others, however, are instantly forgettable and I have difficulty recalling them even though I only saw the film a few days ago.\n\nEven as a child I couldn&apos;t see the point of Emma Fairfax, a character created for the film and not found in Lofting&apos;s books, and I&apos;m none the wiser now. The producers presumably invented her because they wanted a female character and thought that Polynesia the parrot, Sophie the seal and Sheila the fox didn&apos;t count, but they never really found a proper role for Emma, who veers between love-interest for Matthew and love-interest for the Doctor himself without ever coming down on one side or the other. The concentration on Emma means that Tommy, the character I really identified with as he was a boy of my own age, plays a less important role here then he does in the books.\n\nFrom my adult perspective, the film really goes downhill in the second half when the main characters leave England. I have to admit that, although Lofting, an ardent pacifist and animal-rights advocate, was in other respects a man of progressive views, he was also a racist, and some of this is carried across into the Sea Star scenes. When the Doctor and his friends find the Giant Pink Sea Snail the creature seems rather disappointing, making you wonder why they went all that way just to find it. Possibly this was a figment of Lofting&apos;s imagination that works better on the printed page than it does on screen.\n\nThe film still seems to have a following today, and turns up regularly on television, but for me it is a part of my childhood that (unlike, say Disney&apos;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot;) has not retained its magic for me as an adult. 6/10",

He is virtually immortal, insane and a &quot;blood thirsty beast&quot;. Of course there is that one and only secret way to stop him. The gore and effects are fake looking but several of the kills are brutal and intense. The script is poor, the transition between scenes is poor, highlighted with terrible and unconvincing acting through out the entire film. The officer in this film has a cigarette in every sequence he is in, hell, everyone in this film smokes. The soundtrack has some really spectacular moments, a good example is at the 44:16 mark. Sadly the scare tactic during this scene completely deflated with the randomness of the bearded guy. There are several other scare tactics that were hokey and just didn&apos;t work. Overall there is enough &quot;absurd&quot; to keep this fairly entertaining, but ultimately it cannot overcome its consistent failings.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure what I was expecting from this movie, especially since reviews have stated that much of the script was improvised. The film seemed fairly tightly-scripted to me...perhaps this is a tribute to the cast or director.\n\nI also expected to be put-off by the limited screen time of the major names in the movie. To the contrary, I found it refreshing to have good actors in such small, but crucial, roles. This is the only way to avoid making movies into star vehicles that sacrifice story and direction for the sake of glorifying one or more of the lead characters.\n\nOn the other hand, the plot left a bit to be desired. There are quite a few loose ends that never get tied up, including the massive loose end right before the final credits roll. There&apos;s a difference between being ambiguous and simply stopping the story in the middle of an arc. This is your basic 2.5-act movie.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the movie and the characters. There&apos;s virtually no character development, but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. This is worth watching if you enjoy &quot;small&quot; stories about tragedy and get a kick out of a bunch of well-know actors suppressing their desire to be the center of attention.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Oz: The Great and Powerful&quot; is the prequel to 1939&apos;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; that I was frankly not at all surprised by.\n\nThe story is about a circus magician named Oz (James Franco) who, through the fantastic opening segment, we as the audience are told is a con-man earning a living fooling people. From that we follow the typical Disney storyline that, while it is oh so predictable, it is also extremely enjoyable (at least to me).\n\nThe cast did a decent job, although I have to say James Franco knocked it out of the park, delivering a breathtaking performace that really made me care for his character.\n\nFor the most part this movie looks astonishing, utilizing a lot of CGI to create this mystical and magical world, and, though it is noticeable at points, I was never really unimmersed from what was going on.\n\nSam Raimi directed this movie and it shows, I really enjoyed it&apos;s look, albeit some strange cuts here and there.\n\nWhat really let&apos;s this movie down is it&apos;s script, being clearly aimed at children. This doesn&apos;t mean an adult won&apos;t enjoy it because there&apos;s definitely enjoyment to be had but it does mean there will be some eye rolls from time to time.\n\nOverall &quot;Oz: The Great and Powerful&quot; is a fun experience that I look forward to seeing again and, if you have kids, definitely watch this one with them. Trust me, you&apos;ll enjoy it!\n\nB-",

I will freely admit the Errol Flynn version is superior in story but this movie has style where it may lack substance.\n\nApparently, Kevin Costner does not know how to pull off a character with such depth and range as Robin Hood. Whether he lacks the ability to interpret the character or just lacks as an actor I have never cared enough to determine but his failings are upheld widely by the team of Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott who absolutely steal the show.\n\nThis is not to say that this version of the story is without merit. It is worth seeing if only for Morgan Freeman, Wincott, and Rickman. And I&apos;ll guarantee you that this version will absolutely SHINE in comparison to Crowe&apos;s Nottingham (due out 2010). Honestly, the only actor MORE wrong for Robin Hood than Kevin Costner is Russell Crowe. Oy.\n\nAll in all? This is dark and sweeping. It is fun and entertaining and I LIKE IT! \n\nIt rates a 6.8/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",

It was because I appreciate rock music that I hated this piece of trash.\n\nMiley Cyris has no talent AT ALL, her back-up band is REAL loud but otherwise useless, her lyrics (if you can make them out) are heartless and stupid. Smoky Robinson would turn over in his grave, if he were dead. Bill Haley is surely looking down from his Rock in the sky with disgust.\n\nThis film could serve as Exhibit #1 as to why God ought end us all in 2008. But, still, this thing is better than the fodder for intellectual empty-heads known as &quot;No Country for Old Men.&quot; Honestly, if you MUST choose between Hanna Montana and No Country, STAY HOME. But if you can&apos;t then choose Hanna and skip No Country.",

However since it&apos;s obvious that even the makers of the film know that it&apos;s not a credible movie (take a look at the closing credits) it can be forgiven.\n\nThe plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed. He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe that. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars. In  doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half the town.\n\nThis movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the B-Grade movies of the 50&apos;s. This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh. A movie to pass the time away.",

It managed to keep the quintessential Bond attributes yet brings the franchise bang up to date in the absence of the Cold War. Brosnan puts in a stellar performance as Bond and the supporting cast including the gritty Sean Bean as the double crossing villain and just the right amount comedy in Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade and Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky. Nice nods to the past in the use of the Aston DB5 and mentions of M&apos;s predecessors. Even the soundtrack suits the film nicely. There is enough grit and spy content to please the Dalton fans and enough quips and craziness to please the Moore fans. Misses are few and far between - the product placement of the flaccid BMW 1.9 Z3 is poor - it so obviously Un-Bondlike that even the production crew realise and the below par motor barely features in the film at all. This aside, it&apos;s great Bond movie, one of the best infact and well worth a watch.",

In this foreign film by Claude Miller, he managed to weave several story lines that showed dysfunction to the max. It was a bit difficult to feel any empathy at first with the main character&apos;s emotional pain as the character seemed so dispassionate. As the story evolved it was plain to see that the horrific crime committed by the character&apos;s mother in hopes of easing her child&apos;s pain, or perhaps her own might have been the best solution for all involved. Perhaps the moral of this story is that one doesn&apos;t have to be the birth parent to provide a loving and secure home for a child...anyone can be a parent, but not everyone knows how to parent. This film was extremely well done and will leave the viewer with much to think about.",

      "name": "Amazing documentary about American Ballet Theatre",
      "reviewBody": "Ballet (1995) was directed by the amazing documentary director Frederick Wiseman. This four-hour film gives us a sense of what it&apos;s like to be part of a ballet company and school when the theater is closed and the lights aren&apos;t on. (Near the end, we do see some footage of actual performances, but most of the film takes place--literally--behind the scenes\n\nWe all know that what ballet dancers do is perform feats for which the human body is not designed. We also know that it&apos;s immensely difficult to achieve what we see on stage at a ballet performance. What we don&apos;t know is just how hard it is to teach even these immensely talented people how to achieve a great performance.\n\nWiseman&apos;s method is to shoot endless hours of film, and then take bits and pieces of what he has and splice them together. Some scenes last for 15 minutes, but some last for 15 seconds. There&apos;s really no plot. We walk with Wiseman into the rehearsal room, or the break room, or the business office, and we watch with him to see what happens next. (What happens next is often very surprising.) \n\nWiseman is a genius, and, if you watch this long movie, you&apos;ll know a lot more about ballet than you probably knew before. What struck me most is that the ballet instructors are not the most verbal of people. They say things like, &quot;Give me a little more shoulder.&quot; The dancers never say, &quot;I don&apos;t understand what you mean.&quot; They nod, and then they give a little more shoulder. They are physically the cream of the cream, but their careers will always depend upon their ability to understand and then perform what is expected of them.\n\nThe film has some flaws. For example, there&apos;s too much footage at the beach and the Tivoli gardens during the ABT&apos;s European tour. And, as I wrote earlier, if you&apos;re looking for a ballet performance film, this isn&apos;t it. However, if you&apos;re interested in ballet, and you&apos;re interested in watching a great documentary director&apos;s excellent film, Ballet is the right movie for you.\n\nThe film will probably work better on a large screen, but we saw it on DVD, so we could watch it over two nights. I&apos;m glad we took the time and made the effort. It&apos;s really worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "I stay wondering why so many directors and screenplay writers of wannabe-horror movies ruin the good ideas they have in the beginning. This movie starts really good, it seems to deal with hobby mountain-climbing and interpersonal tensions. Indeed, mountain-climbing can turn out to be real horror if you are not particularly good at it and if you take a closed (certainly not without a reason) path. In the first 1/2 hour of the movie, nice camera shots and great landscapes convey a feeling of vertigo and a vague sense of danger - which is very, very credible in the given situation. Things can go wrong, ropes can tear, vertigo can drive you to madness, you can get lost in the mountains, there can be a tempest - all that is horror, because it is likely to happen in real life. So WHY the hell is there any need for &quot;boosting&quot; a life-like situation with some maniac moron hunting the characters? WHY do they always turn a real horror situation into a stereotyped, paper-thin, seen-over-a-thousand-of-times slasher? It is the same with &quot;The Descent&quot; which had excellent premises to get really scary (in the end, there are not many things as gruesome as being trapped in some huge subterranean labyrinth of holes without any map) but instead, decided to put in some stupid monsters which ruined the whole suspense and the sense of horror. Horrific are only things which seem realistic or in some way convey the sense of the possibility to get realistic. There is no need for additional &quot;boost&quot;! Folks, show me a horror movie based on completely natural premises and the appropriate development of characters in the given situation - and I will sing you a love song. But it seems easier to get some mad hunter or monsters in than to develop real tensions and real situations.",

      "reviewBody": "Bury Them Deep is directed by Paolo Moffa and written by Enzo Dell&apos;Aquila. It stars Craig Hill, Ettore Manni, Giovanni Cianfriglia (as Ken Wood) and José Greci. Music is by Nino Fidenco and cinematography by Franco Villa.\n\nEssentially it&apos;s a buddy buddy spagwest, with the plot seeing Hill and Manni as an unlikely pair brought together in the search for stolen gold. The booty, robbed from the army, has been hidden by renowned tough guy Billy The Gun (Cianfriglia). It&apos;s very much a collage of other genre movies, but that doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t fun and exciting, because it is - that is on proviso you are not a hard core spagwest fan hoping for something to reach your best of lists!\n\nFirst half of pic is more sedate than the second, as the makers build the jittery relationship between the two protags. Aided by Fidenco&apos;s schizophrenic - irritatingly catchy - musical score (woodwind and percussion on acid sometimes), tone always suggests a tongue in cheek approach. Not to say there isn&apos;t violence, since there is lots of it, shoot-outs, an extended knife fight and general raucous bad behaviour fill out the story, all completed with spagwest traditions such as exaggerated dives and punches.\n\nThere&apos;s some nifty scenes and inventive camera shots, where we like see-saw hangings, great escape from being trussed up, and up-tilt shots of horses leaping. The stunt work is good dollar, with plenty of deaths from heights (cliffs and windows of course), this certainly doesn&apos;t lack for human efforts. The villains, in among shifting allegiances and mistrust, are a roll call of laughing hyena Mexicans, or in Cianfriglia&apos;s case (looking suspiciously like Burt Reynolds here!), very cool and measured. All in all it&apos;s not top line spaghetti, but filling enough for those after a fun genre time waster. 6.5/10",

This movie sadly repeats clichés seen a thousand times before. I would recommend any average Bollywood-flick on ghosts instead of this useless waste of time. This is a haunting-story like most of them; the dead returns in spirit-form to undo injustice perpetrated against them in life. There&apos;s nothing disturbing or the least scary in this classic setup. Unless you&apos;re maybe totally new to these kind of films. What is really frightening is the lousy screenplay, lacking any interesting plot-events or the least original initiative. Sonja Richter normally seems talented. In this film, though, she seems utterly talentless, burnt out &amp; is lacking any chemistry with her male counterpart. She&apos;s not at any point believable and she&apos;s not able to keep one&apos;s interest in this by all means ridiculous film. It saddens me that the danish film industry spends money on such worthless movies. All known &amp; talented actors are casted, but none of them able to raise this movie above the ridiculously dull, lame and unoriginal.",

      "reviewBody": "Minnie Sharma (Revathi) and her family have just moved to a new town. Her sister and sister&apos;s husband died in a car accident, and she&apos;s left taking care of their young child, &quot;Bunty&quot; (Master Atit), in conjunction with her parents and their &quot;manservant&quot;, Narayan (Chinna). As Raat opens, Minnie is having nightmares about being isolated as some strange, mysterious force chases her. Eventually these nightmares cross over into daydreams/hallucinations. When she goes out on a date with Deepak (Kushant), she ends up in the woods by herself, and her nightmares threaten to become real.\n\nRaat is a quality Indian Psychological Horror/Thriller, marred by some looseness in the plot. Die-hard horror fans may also be occasionally distracted by pegging where the film is derivative of popular western horror films. The performances are fine, with Revathi standing out in particular, and the technical aspects are good, even though the version I watched--the Eros International DVD version for the UK and the United States (and other English-speaking areas)--was made from a very questionable print of the film. The image is frequently dirty and scratched, the soundtrack is slightly out of sync with the video, the subtitle timing is often off, and there is a lot of artifacting on the DVD transfer, which also wasn&apos;t properly divided into chapters. Of course for these technical issues, I do not subtract any points, as I&apos;m rating the content of the film imagining an ideal print. It was a shame that the transfer couldn&apos;t have been better, as Teja&apos;s cinematography seems like it would otherwise be very attractive.\n\nI enjoyed Raat the most in its opening scenes. Writer/director Ram Gopal Varma begins right in the middle of a horror sequence that could very well be the climax. Minnie steps off of a bus by herself and is soon running from some unseen force through a somewhat rundown looking neighborhood, which is eerily void of other humans. I would guess that the creepiness of such &quot;ghost town&quot; isolation might hit native Indians even harder, as it&apos;s probably unusual to find such a deserted town, and especially unusual for someone to exit a bus without being met by family or friends. The scene goes on long enough that it&apos;s a surprise when she finally wakes up. The first section of the film is primarily focused on these bizarre lapses into an alternate, desolate reality. To an extent, I later wished that Varma had kept the whole film in this same mode, as it was done so excellently--it was on firm &quot;10 out of 10&quot; ground throughout the first section. But the subsequent material was entertaining enough, even if the meandering and eventual slight lack of logic for the menace caused me to lower my score a bit.\n\nVarma wears his horror influences on his sleeve throughout Raat. The beginning has some strong resemblances to the first two Evil Dead films (1981 and 1987)--this is especially noticeable in the interesting hand-held cinematography representing the evil force. Shortly after, Raat takes a turn towards an Amityville Horror (1979)-styled haunted house flick, complete with the sound of masses of flies (and this occurs periodically throughout the film). Later, there are elements of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), the Exorcist (1973), and even Friday the 13th (1980)--I suppose we could say that if you&apos;re going to &quot;steal&quot;, steal from the best. If you dislike strong influences and you know those precursor films, this might be a cue to avoid Raat. I don&apos;t mind influence; Varma weaves his disparate sources together adeptly.\n\nThe music, by Mani Sharma (an obvious influence on the main character&apos;s name in the film), can be a bit uneven. At times it is almost comically over-exaggerated, with very prominent &quot;cheesy&quot; late 1970s/1980s synthesizer tonalities. At other times, it&apos;s almost sublime, perfectly atmospheric. I was especially fond of the way Sharma and Varma incorporated traditional Indian wedding music during a crucial, &quot;big turning point&quot; scene. Other than that, there is not a lot of traditional music in the film, and there are no musical song/dance numbers--a characteristic that has become somewhat common in Indian horror, even if it is very unusual otherwise.\n\nHorror fans should not expect to see a lot of gore or special effects. When such effects do occur, they come off a bit cheesy. So it&apos;s better that Varma tends to stick with subtlety, suggestion and reaction to experienced/observed horrors. He easily handles this more understated style.\n\nFinally, even though Raat eventually ends up in more off-the-wall supernatural territory, much of the film can be taken as a metaphor for schizophrenia--in fact, Varma goes to some lengths to show us a literal parallel while engaging in the metaphor at the same time. Minnie&apos;s early &quot;hallucinations&quot; and her later &quot;possessions&quot; tend to be accompanied by catatonia. She has olfactory hallucinations as well. She loses track of Bunty and lets him remain in unusual isolation when she&apos;s supposed to be watching him. She becomes anti-social and violent, and so on. Even the more supernatural material works well for this interpretation, as mental disorders such as schizophrenia were misdiagnosed as &quot;possession by demons&quot; and similar claims throughout history. I wouldn&apos;t say that Varma intended the whole film as only a metaphor for schizophrenia, but that&apos;s obviously one of his intentions, along with simply telling a good horror/thriller yarn.",

As I was in the cinema, I was saying the characters&apos; lines along with them, so easy to predict...\n\nMoreover, it was a bit annoying how they kept meeting without seeing each other... Blah.\n\nBut the worst thing is that the movie is disappointing as it reflects Bebo and Shahid&apos;s 2005 way of acting, which has improved lottts now. Have you seen how excellent they both were in Jab We Met? And Kareena in 3 Idiots? And...? One good point, it shows all the work they have done from then to now.\n\nThis movie is not good, as it&apos;s a 2005 average movie that seems totally offbeat in 2010&apos;s Bollywood.\n\nThe songs by Himesh Reshammiya aren&apos;t too bad, average as always.\n\nIt feels nice to see Bebo and Sahid on screen together, but the magic isn&apos;t really back...",

      "reviewBody": "Greenberg, about a discontented 40 year old who&apos;s not at all sure what he&apos;s doing with his life, is a provocative slice of life - but it&apos;s not for all tastes. It moves slowly and demands extra attention, but even if you&apos;re really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went.\n\nBen Stiller, in a terrific performance, is the titular ne&apos;er do well, an itinerant carpenter housesitting for his brother in Los Angeles for six weeks. During that time, be meets and falls in and out of like for his brother&apos;s executive assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig, who&apos;s also magnificent), who&apos;s just as awkward as Roger Greenberg.\n\nThe bulk of the film covers their relationship on one track and the events of Greenberg&apos;s past that have led to his existential where-am-I ponderances. Some 15 years earlier, Roger was in a band out of college with a few good friends. They were apparently quite good, but when a record company offered them a deal, Roger turned it down, afraid of the success it might bring. This led to a serious rift in the band, causing each member to go his separate way; none of the members has played much music in the intervening years.\n\nLiking Roger isn&apos;t easy for anyone, not even the audience. He&apos;s sort of a jerk. (It&apos;s mentioned that he&apos;s just been released from a mental institution, although the cause for his hospitalization is not explained.) The film indicates that Roger has problems maintaining relationships, sometimes acting out - and lashing out - in order to keep himself safe and serene. His arrival in LA allows him to reconnect with several of his old friends, many of whom he hasn&apos;t seen in those 15 years.\n\nIt&apos;s these fractured relationships that hold the key to Greenberg&apos;s life. At times, he tries to patch things up and move on with his life, but he&apos;s just as likely to snap at the friend or lapse into the same behavioral issues that had plagued him as a young man.\n\nStiller is really, really good in this. He&apos;s surprisingly very good at showing myriad emotions convincingly. At once, you believe Greenberg is a polarizing, hurting, hurtful man on the cusp of the rest of his life. Stiller&apos;s brand of comedy can take time to grow on someone, but he really shows his range here. I certainly didn&apos;t know he could plumb the depths of a character like he did to Roger Greenberg.\n\nGerwig is his equal and is a real presence here. Florence is - like her namesake Nightingale - a huge help to Greenberg&apos;s brother as his assistant, and he&apos;s much more savvy about taking care of the house than Greenberg is about taking care of himself (in a funny early scene, she asks him to make a list of things for her to get at the store, and he writes &quot;whiskey&quot; and &quot;sandwiches&quot;). But as good as she is at her professional life, her personal life is an absolute mess. She goes on one-night stands because they feel good - okay, no problem there - but she has few true connections in life. She has one good friend, and you get the impression that her family isn&apos;t really close to her (she says her niece doesn&apos;t relate too well to her). Florence is physically and emotionally awkward, unsure of herself in all ways save for her job, in which she&apos;s commanding. This, of course, also makes her terribly vulnerable to the advances of the older Greenberg.\n\nSo the acting is really top notch, but the movie just isn&apos;t for everyone. Here&apos;s why. There&apos;s a lot of plot, a lot of things happening, but very little is resolved or accomplished; the film almost feels like a stream of consciousness to which we&apos;re privy. What WILL Greenberg do after the six weeks are up? Will he stay with Florence? Will he jilt her? In the end, does it really matter? Probably not; the ending is abrupt, although not out of place for the rest of the film. But one really needs to be atuned to Greenberg&apos;s plight in order to enjoy the film. If one isn&apos;t, the movie&apos;s mostly dull with bits of funny moments interspersed throughout. I didn&apos;t find it terribly heartwarming, just a character study of an unlikable character. Which is not a bad thing at all, but this one just didn&apos;t completely work for me.",

      "reviewBody": "I try to watch this movie every year or so.  It reminds me of my youth when I didn&apos;t have any preconceived notions about what a film should or shouldn&apos;t be.  A time when I had total suspension of disbelief. \n\nI remember when my ten-year-old eyes first caught a glance at the greatest horror movie poster that ever hung in the hallowed foyer of our local movie theatre, The D&amp;R in Aberdeen, Washington.  The poster featured a gargantuan spider bearing down on a group of terrified people.  Suspended in the air above the monster were three helicopters and lying crumpled at the spider&apos;s legs were a couple of burning cars while spotlights filled the sky.  One of the terrified was a busty young blonde wearing only a negligee.  I was sold.\n\nEvery kid in town must have seen the `coming soon&apos; poster because the next day in school all halls were abuzz with nervous anticipation of what was going to be the greatest cinematic experience of our young lives: THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION!  Our local newspaper (The Daily World) had a beautiful half-page advertisement featuring the glorious poster art.  I cut it out and hung it on the refrigerator so my mom wouldn&apos;t forget. \n\n After a torturous week of school, the opening day finally arrived.  Packs of kids, with parents in tow, rushed to secure a place in line at the D&amp;R.  The line wrapped around the block.  Aberdeen hadn&apos;t seen this much excitement since Jaws played there the previous year.  \n\nOnce inside the lobby, ushers showered the crowd with little black plastic spiders.  Kids scrambled everywhere  clawing and climbing over each other to get their hands on these rare collector&apos;s items.  I snagged a few off the ground and then rushed into the theatre to secure a seat for my Mom, my brother and me.  \n\nThe theatre was filled to capacity.  Those who did not make it in for the first show were forced to wait until the 9:00 p.m. show.  Back in the seventies there were only two show times during the weekdays: 7:00p.m. and 9:00p.m.  It was truly Darwin&apos;s `survival of the fittest&apos; in action.\n\nAt precisely 7:00p.m., the theatre grew dark and the screen was illuminated with the coming attraction: Squirm! The theatre was filled with whoops and screams as slime-coated killer worms with fangs tore into flesh, but soon a collective kid-groan could be heard as the rating `R&apos; flashed after the preview.  Thankfully, our attention was focused off the fact that most of our parents would not permit us to see the `R&apos; rated film when the title: The Giant Spider Invasion filled the screen.\n\nFor the next 85 minutes, we were treated to a town exposed to a `miniature&apos; black hole&apos; that creates a `space warp&apos; inviting in alien-spiders that grow to mammoth proportions.  The film really delivered the goods!  A grungy farmer discovers a half-eaten body whose rib-cage is partially exposed, a girl comes out of the shower baring her breasts and, in a glorious shower of blood, the spiders suck up a couple of people into their puckered-festering mouths!  Cries of horror and disbelief could be heard throughout the auditorium.  A couple of ushers had to remove a bawling friend of mine after he saw the partially eaten remains of one of the victims  too much for his delicate sensibilities.  I sat transfixed.  This was the greatest movie ever made.  The next day, I dragged a few of my friends to watch the matinee  we stayed for the remaining showings and returned the following day.  The movie played in Aberdeen for only a week, but I must have seen it a dozen times.\n\nYears later, I found The Giant Spider Invasion at a video store and immediately purchased it.  I watched it with the same glee I did back in 1975 and the fond memories I held came flooding back. \n\n Watching it now I chuckle as Alan `The Skipper&apos; Hale delivers lines like, `He&apos;s a strange man and he&apos;s building up a big head of steam.&apos;  But, seeing the spiders, which seemed so real back in the good old D&amp;R, crawl over the beautiful Wisconsin countryside, still gives me a small thrill.  Even though it&apos;s obvious the spiders are badly made up VW Beetles, it still takes me back to a time when all movies I watched were magical.\n\nThere were giants in those days.",

      "reviewBody": "Before Jim Davis got his last and career part as Jock Ewing in Dallas, he had one tortured path to Hollywood success. He had a much publicized debut as Bette Davis&apos;s leading man in Winter Meeting which was one of her worst films. His portrayal of a war hero about to enter the priesthood met with a ton of critical guffaws. Still Davis persisted and took any kind of work. The Monster from Green Hell qualifies as any kind of work.\n\nA wasp is sent up in space to see the effects. Unfortunately on re-entry the space capsule crashes in the region of West Africa and the wasp has grown to the size of a Panzer tank. To top it all off the geniuses sending up the rocket sent up a pregnant queen so we&apos;ve got all kinds of those Panzer wasps running around Africa.\n\nJim Davis is sent to clean up the mess and runs into a medical missionary played by Vladimir Sokoloff. Albert Schweitzer was very much alive at the time and running his mission in West Africa. No one in 1958 mistook who Sokoloff was portraying. The wasps set up a colony in the shadow of a volcano. You can figure out the rest.\n\nThis is typical Fifties science fiction when all kinds of radiation was the explanation for these creatures. In this case it was the radiation from cosmic rays, presumably from the newly discovered Van Allen belt around the earth. \n\nTepid acting and chintzy special effects make The Monster from Green Hell great cult stuff. One thing though that is timely. An Arab character played by Eduardo Ciannelli joins forces with Davis and one of the natives Joel Fluellen to combat the danger the giant wasps present. Amazing how religious differences can suddenly melt away in time of crisis.",

This comedy is like a parody of hardcore action films, so don&apos;t expect any mind-blowing depth. Just go with the flow. It&apos;s fun.\n\nI hadn&apos;t any significant expectations for this movie, so the enjoyment was even bigger. At times the plot might be a bit predictable but that doesn&apos;t disturb the ride at all. It&apos;s got fast pace, entertaining action scenes and it&apos;s fun. Fun is the word here. The cast was brilliant, as well. Zoe Saldana was great as always. And for the first time i felt that Chris Evans (Push-junk and Fantasticless 4) did a good job. The villain was a bit weak though. But descent acting carried the movie for the whole time. All you need.\n\nAs long as you don&apos;t take it seriously, it is brilliant and you won&apos;t be disappointed. Shoot &apos;em up!",

      "reviewBody": "Ever since the success of Stephen Chow&apos;s Shaollin Soccer in 2001, he&apos;s been asked time and again whether a sequel was in the works. There still isn&apos;t, but he sort of franchised the idea out to the Japanese and served as executive producer, so the outcome of the deal, was Shaolin Girl.\n\nHowever, the net of it all is that while the intent for a quasi-sequel is there, having the Japanese play characters experts in the classic Chinese form of martial arts might seem a little wrong, just like how the hue and cry came about with Chinese characters portraying Japanese geishas. But if the source in contention was treated with respect, I guess there would be no qualms moving forward, though with the way things were treated here, you would&apos;ve pondered whether it was done in jest, or in mockery.\n\nFor instance, the numerous Bruce Lee homage. Yes, we all know about all things yellow, so it&apos;s a no brainer here. But to have a lookalike come out as a villain, dressed in a white singlet, black pants and emulating Lee on the nunchuks, was a tad below the belt, especially the way he was disgracefully dispatched. A friend of mine said it was perhaps a kick in the face toward all the imitations and wannabes, but I&apos;d like to think otherwise. The finale look straight out of Game of Death where our alpha-female do battle floor to floor encountering various martial arts masters, but come to think of it, they were dispatched with incredible ease. And don&apos;t get me started on the corridor of mirrors too, which served no purpose other than to show that the filmmakers can.\n\nLead actress Kou Shibasaki (from Crying Out Love In The Center of the World) in the titular role looks good and cute for the part in order to draw in the crowds, and granted she has no martial arts background (ala new female warrior Jeeja Yanin in Chocolate) she makes up for it with artificially choreographed grace that made her a little believable. What&apos;s not believable, was her ability to speak Chinese, and the Shaolin monks as well, because they are clearly Japanese, but had to pass off as experts in the language, which came off as unbearable and laughable. \n\nYou might think that director Katsuyuki Motohiro, with his Bayside Shakedown pedigree, would be deft at handling stories with multiple subplots. However, Shaolin Girl bitten off more than it could chew, and couldn&apos;t decide what it wanted to be. On one hand, it wanted to spread the love for Kung Fu, or specifically, the Shaolin brand of fist-fighting. On the other, it had to reflect on its supposed predecessor and fuse in a sport different from soccer (here it&apos;s Lacrosse). And it wanted to weave kung fu into the game, only to hold back to prevent itself from being a clone. So while you get a sport, there isn&apos;t much copycat kung-fu styles and stances, until the end credit roll when it became obvious.\n\nShaolin Girl Rin Sakurazara was sent as a kid by her grandfather to China&apos;s famed Shaolin school of martial arts to learn to curb and control her wealth of potential, promised power. What this power was, nobody knew, except that everyone knew she had to be protected from the villains lest she gets tempted to go to the Dark Side (yes, so very Star Wars). But she returns upon completion of her training to revive her grandfather&apos;s dojo, and does so in quite an impetuous headstrong manner, that she has a few lessons to learn herself, such as humility, camaraderie and teamwork, before she can impart those martial arts lessons.\n\nHowever, despite all that talk about teaming, it still boiled down to a one-woman whackfest for the last act. If you&apos;re looking for some serious fighting, then the first two acts of the movie will bore as you only get teases spruced very much by special effects, some bits too, especially those involving Lacrosse, got too repetitive. Kitty Zhang, Chow&apos;s new muse from CJ7, ends up in this movie too to provide some lesbian undertones (ok, so I chose to read it that way, but think about it). and although she has a meatier role here as a naive do-gooder, the role still boiled down to a flower vase in cheongsam.\n\nAnd if you&apos;re patient and were waiting to be rewarded with some proper combat for the finale, be prepared to be disappointed too. For all the talk about her prowess, you&apos;ll laugh at what Rin pulled off. Not that it&apos;s a comedy and you&apos;re supposed to chuckle, but you&apos;re laughing at its delivery instead, for all the wrong reasons. Never have I seen something that hokey, and anti-climatic as well. Not only that, the fights were unimaginative and, horrors, boring too, while the villains were all reduced to mindless goons ala Crazy88 style, with some tendencies to caress man boobs, and totally unmenacing, with lead villains having zero motivation other than to desire to fight. I nearly fell off my seat when it ventured close to The Promise territory with its take on the tykes.\n\nEven supporting appearances by characters from Shaolin Soccer couldn&apos;t save the day, and became ridiculous caricatures of themselves. Perhaps what could rescue Shaolin Girl, was a cameo by Chow who probably might have upped the credibility of this flick, but alas, knowing that it would stink, he rightfully kept his distance. And so should you, unless you&apos;re a fan of either Kitty Zhang or Kou Shibasaki, then you can lap up all the close-up shots.",

      "reviewBody": "Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are a great comedy team. In fact, the best part of Guilt Trip is when the credits are rolling at the end, and there are several scenes that the two of them apparently improvised during the filming. If the whole movie had been as entertaining as those outtakes, I would have given it a &quot;10.&quot; \n\nUnfortunately, the makers of Guilt Trip appear to believe that a movie requires a plot, and sadly, this one was clunky. For a comedy film to work, you either have to completely put reality aside (Blazing Saddles or Rocky Horror Picture Show), or somehow believe an unbelievable story (Airplane or the Blues Brothers). This film didn&apos;t fall into either category. The plot just wasn&apos;t strong enough to support the premise that any son would be crazy enough to take his mother on a long business trip with him, and there was no reason why he kept bringing her to all his business appointments. And his mother&apos;s nutty revealing of her deepest family secret, and her insane baby-naming system, were clearly tossed in just to provide somewhere for this film to go.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong. I&apos;d really like Streisand and Rogen to do another road trip together. But next time, let&apos;s just say that space aliens abducted them and forced them to travel together. And let both of the stars ad lib their way through the adventure. I&apos;d pay to see that one.",

However, in the following two hours, you don&apos;t get a clue about political circumstances. You get to know a terror-group, schwarzer Sturm, which seemingly operates world-wide, but meetings are only held in one strangely artistic set-up room in Berlin. Not plausible.\n\nThe weakest points of this movie are: No background information, solely concentrating on the 4 main characters, which are unfortunately boring as hell and show almost none development, no political plot, and therefore the story is not believable.\n\nAfter watching the trailer, we were lured in some expectation about a great film....which it simply wasn&apos;t at all.\n\nBad ending, however good musical main-theme... which however, really gets boring after hearing it all over again during the movie.\n\nI really cannot recommend this movie. The basic idea was great, but they missed their chance by far. It has the quality of an Sat1 &quot;Fernsehfilm der Woche&quot;. Don&apos;t waste your money. You will be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "Fragile (AKA: Fragiles) is directed by Juame Balaguero who also co- writes the screenplay with Jordi Galceran. It stars Calista Flockhart, Elena Anaya, Yasmin Murphy, Richard Roxburgh and Colin McFarlane. Music is by Roque Banos and cinematography by Xavi Gimenez.\n\nMercy Falls Children&apos;s Hospital, Isle of White, soon to be closed down and currently only housing the last few child patients and a skeleton crew of staff.. It is also home to something else, something sinister up on the second floorapparently.\n\nSupernatural spooker involving kids in peril, Fragile is quintessentially a ghost story movie for the undemanding like minded film fan looking for chills, jumps and atmosphere abound. Those in search of something new thrown on to the haunted building table are advised to steer clear, for in spite of a somewhat bonkers finale, where hospital apocalypse is the order of the day, this stays safely on the well trodden path.\n\nYet when done well enough clichés are not a problem, such is the case here. Flockhart&apos;s nurse has mental anguish in her past which she inevitably has to exorcise, and naturally she&apos;s going to be the heroine in some shape or form, we know this as she&apos;s the American come to the Isle of White to work, a new start. However, it&apos;s a nicely drawn characterisation that engages when the bond between nurse and one particularly troubled child is fully born.\n\nWith the back drop that of a Gothic hospital (exteriors really Bearwood College in Berkshire, England), complete with a closed ward straight out of Session 9, atmosphere is well maintained by Balaguero, and of course whenever there are sick and dying kids involved there&apos;s always a deep sadness dripped into film. The scares range from standard things that go clang in the night, lifts and beds that come to life, and edge of the seat inducing walks around dead silent parts of the hospital. Then there&apos;s that ending\n\nThe story involving the reason for the haunting is a neat one, unfortunately the entity in its realisation is not. We are introduced to something monstrous, but it belongs in a different movie, perhaps a Clive Barker inspired one in fact. Some will (and already do) find it very freaky, but I feel it goes a bit away from the traditional ghost movie flavours previously sprinkled throughout the picture. However, there&apos;s a genuine surprise at film&apos;s closure, where not reverting to formula type is a major bonus.\n\nDerivative? Yes more often than not. Good time assured for fans of haunted house like mysteries? Absolutely! 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "I would like to reiterate what &quot;Anonymous of Derby, England&quot; said about this film (20th November). The fact that so many people have complained that they &quot;didn&apos;t get it&quot; is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking for us. I had no trouble in following the plot and found the fact that I actually had to concentrate and think things through quite refreshing. Okay, so a lot of the stunts were a bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining? After all, it is only a movie; nobody expects us to believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us to believe that King Kong really existed or that there&apos;s a Volcano ready to errupt in L.A. Besides, with the inspired casting of David Schneider as the train driver, Brian de Palma must have had his tongue in his cheek for at least some of the time. He&apos;s created a masterful boy&apos;s own adventure story, an original &quot;ripping yarn&quot; and that brilliant comic touch added to this perfectly.\n\n&quot;Mission Impossible&quot; is a visual and cerebral treat. Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian and Jean Reno is watchable in ANYTHING he does. The only weak link is Emmanuelle Beart, who did a good job of looking beautiful but very little else. What a shame Kristin Scott Thomas couldn&apos;t have taken a more central role; she makes the gorgeous but bland Beart look like a waste of space.\n\nI give this 8 out of ten and it would have been more if it wasn&apos;t for Beart&apos;s character.",

      "reviewBody": "The difficulty with bringing a piece of revered literature to the big screen has more to do with pleasing the fans of the work than in making a pleasing movie. Those who hold Walter Scott&apos;s classic &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in high esteem will deem any adaptation to a largely visual medium unworthy no matter how much care and devotion are given to visualizing the original source.\n\nThis version of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; holds up well and remains one of the more realistic films dealing with the myth, legends, and pomp of the High Middle Ages. The pictorial representation of Judaism at a time of wide-spread persecution of that religion throughout Europe by Christians who continually used the Jews as scapegoats was noble indeed for 1952, the height of the McCarthy witch hunts. The audience of the day undoubtedly overlooked this point when Rebecca is accused of witchcraft in order to insure conformity and stifle opposition to Prince John&apos;s tyrannical rule of England in King Richard&apos;s absence.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, this film is about as accurate as any of the numerous Robin Hood tales prevalent at the time in the movies and on TV. Ivanhoe&apos;s father is correct when he remarks that Richard would be no better than John as far as the Saxons were concerned. Both Richard and John were ineffectual rulers. Prince John (later King John) has received a bad press as a result of the lionization of Richard the Lionheart. At least John stayed home and attempted to rule England; whereas, Richard was always traipsing about Europe and the Near East on a Crusade or leading his knights in battle mainly for personal gain. His ransom as a result of falling into the hands of the Germans was costly for his realm. Neither Richard or John was the skilled administrator their father, Henry II, proved to be, one of England&apos;s greatest monarchs. Neither inherited the diplomatic skills of their mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the great women leaders in western civilization.\n\nThe division between the Saxons and Normans as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066 is at the crux of the story, Ivanhoe being Saxon, the royal family being Norman, descended from William the Conqueror. Nothing is said about those who lived on the British Isles before either the Saxons or the Normans, the Celts first, then the conquering Romans.\n\nA highlight of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is the jousting tournament, leading to rivalry between Ivanhoe (Robert Taylor) and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert (George Sanders), a rivalry that extends to winning the hand and heart of Rebecca. The alluring nineteen-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who portrays Rebecca is at the peak of her beauty and loveliness. George Sanders and Robert Taylor were much older than Elizabeth at the time. Taylor was uncomfortable making love, even on celluloid, to one so young, especially since he recalled her as a child in the early days of his movie career.\n\nThe brilliant Technicolor cinematography is bewitching even by today&apos;s standards. Adding to the eye-catching color are the action scenes, especially toward the end of the movie. The besieging of the castle is directed with élan by Richard Thorpe, who learned his trade well from directing action packed B films.\n\nThe acting is top notch throughout with Guy Rolfe as the loathsome Prince John stealing every scene he&apos;s in. The weakest is Emlyn Williams who plays Wamba (a chattel who becomes Ivanhoe&apos;s Squire). Wamba apparently is supposed to supply comic relief and is given some good lines by the writers, but Williams tends to overplay the part to the extent that at times the character becomes an obnoxious loudmouth.",

Maybe they were not treated well by the studio (that seems to be common) but it made this all the better. Sure, the gorilla suit and snapping crocodiles are nice, but it is hard to beat a living animal -- lions! \n\nThis is slightly less witty than their other work, the films with Universal. Some of the cracks are amusing, but it does not seem to be on the same level as &quot;meet Frankenstein&quot; or &quot;meet the Killer&quot;. Is this because of the studio or the writing? I have no idea. Fans should still see it... besides, it has Shemp Howard!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a great film.  Some have said it epitomizes the 1960s glamour comedies but what it cleverly does is parody them, and other film genres, through its movie dream sequences and the ridiculous and gorgeous costumes Shirley wears. It has a great cast and everyone is in top tongue in cheek form.  Dick Van Dyke plays his usual neo-Marx brothers physical comedy schtick (with Margaret DuMont, no less!) at the height of his powers.  Paul Newman is great playing against type as a tortured artist, a perfect sendup of Kirk Douglas&apos; portrayal of Van Gough in *Lust for Life* (he even wears the same beard).  Mitchum is suave and cool as a kind of Cash McCall gone wrong, but far more slick then Jim Garner ever was.  To top it off, Gene Kelley does an incredible spot on parody of himself in the Holywood story, with iconic images taken straight from his greatest triumph *Singing in the Rain,* turned on their head and twisted into a grotesque commentary on the evils of Hollywood as opposed to its dreams and glamour. The scene where he is trampled to death by his fans holds up a hilarious mirror to the similar scene in *Singing in the Rain* where he has his clothes torn off by them. This film elevated parody to a high art form before anybody had even heard the term &quot;post modernism!&quot;  And those gowns she wears!  The best one is the one which is just a string of pearls down Shirley&apos;s sexy back (she faces away from the camera for the shole scene because she is obviously topless). They must have cost a fortune! this is obviously a film with a very Lush Bugett!",

Davis had a crush on Brent in high school but left for New York once he married Ann Dvorak, and now is hired as the chief advertising copywriter at the unheard of salary of $25,000 per year by the advertising firm where Brent works. (Brent earns $2,100 a year as office manager.) When Brent quits at the urging of Dvorak and starts his own firm, Davis is lured back to work for him and the trouble starts. This was the type of role Davis could eat up if it were in the hands of more capable screenwriters and the mores of the 30&apos;s permitted it. Then it might have been called &quot;Homewrecker,&quot; with the emphasis on Davis rather than Dvorak. Still, it&apos;s fun to watch the stars and is a good example of an early Bette Davis film.",

The story is the strongest point, it gives scattered hints or pieces of a puzzle that all come together at the end, and that is by far the best thing of this movie. Unfortunately, I think that everything else fell short, and was treated as a B-movie, from photography to editing down to the actors, that at the end, I feel ,did not performed at the level I would have expected. I really think that the ambiance of a movie is as important as the story itself, and probably taking this story back in time, in a more charming looking atmosphere, (like &quot;The Extraordinary Adventures Of Adele Blanc&quot;),adding a voice in the back that gives you more information about all the characters you meet, and definitely having a better editing and photography would have made this an all time &quot;Classic Christmas Movie&quot;.

But wait a minute. &quot;Ils&quot; is not a copycat nor its contents are equal to &quot;Spoorloos&quot;. I am talking about the tense, the suspense and the frightful atmosphere this movie delivers to you.\n\nThe movie runs thru a hour and ten minutes always packed with great thrilling cinematography that could take you into a breathless awe. &quot;Ils&quot; don&apos;t have a great plot but it&apos;s not two minutes of suspense here and there... it&apos;s a whole hour of constant excitement of anticipation of an approaching climax! The acting is very good, very credible and natural. (Congratulations Olivia Bonamy and Michael Cohen because you guys connect &quot;trés bien&quot; on the screen).\n\nThe story is about a french couple living in a rural mansion in the outskirts of Bucuresti, Romania, that one night are surprised by some bizarre visitors that start to terrorize them. But who are really THEM? That&apos;s what we gonna find at the end and that&apos;s what it makes it more desirable to go see David Moreau&apos;s/Xavier Paludo&apos;s &quot;Ils&quot;.\n\nIf you plan to see gore, forget it. Nevertheless this flick surpasses the goriest movie around. It was based on a true event and this makes it more scary and unpredictable.\n\nDefinitely a truly horror/thriller movie plot. Unmissable.",

      "name": "To Love is to Lose, and to Lose is to Love back ; if a Relationship depends on Personal Reasons",
      "reviewBody": "A poet said that there are 3 types of love: First for a REASON... You love someone for a reason(because she&apos;s beautiful,because she&apos;s special etc.) Second is to love AS... You love someone as good as she loves you,as much as you love your mum, etc. Third is to love DESPITE... Despite she&apos;s ugly, despite she&apos;s moody, despite she&apos;s lighthearted, etc. Then he added, to truly love someone is to accept her/his nature with pros and cons altogether.\n\nIn Kim Ki-duk&apos;s &quot;Shi gan(Time)&quot; the whole plot is based on a Korean couple who are at their mid-20s. Even though, they&apos;re getting prepared to marry, they don&apos;t realize that their relation is still relying on reasons. Like every fresh couple, since they don&apos;t express their needs and wishes to each other, their harmony goes downhill by time. Seh-Hee surprisingly leaves her lover without any warning or explanation due to her jealousy on him. She decides to have a plastic surgery to get a more beautiful face than she has. That way, when she comes back, she&apos;ll feel more comfortable for securing her love through her beauty. In other words, she leaves him for the shortfall of trust in their relationship. Right here at the character intro scenes(the first half-an-hour) there&apos;s a drastic message: You love someone for a reason, you&apos;ll lose her/him for another.\n\nKim Ki-duk has set his screenplay out for reflecting the social affinity of South Korean women to plastic surgery. Social statistics mark that South Korea is among the world&apos;s top 3 countries regarding this subject. Kim Ki-duk&apos;s cinema language carries a great focus on the main plot and he enriches this focus with use of Symbolism. Just like in a poet, each word and each act represents a deeper meaning more than itself. This creates a few memorable scenes: First in the public ferry-boat scene, second the scene with sculptures and figurines at the beach park, third the change of the tide on the beach when lovers are parted, finally before the closure most of the Seh-Hee&apos;s parts carry Symbolism in words: \n\n1/&quot;If we turn around and make eye contact, then we should meet again. One, two, three...&quot;(means my eyes were at you when you were with other women, if you&apos;ve ever been aware of that I&apos;d never have left you) \n\n2/&quot;You should realize how happy you are, just do well on your part&quot;(means you must be happy for being loved by me) \n\n3/&quot;Things happening suddenly, when something lost, it never comes back&quot;(means love happens all of a sudden, when you&apos;re loved you&apos;re not aware of it; the moment you start to aware of someone&apos;s love, it vanishes away)\n\nInstead of trying to express the feelings with words, Kim Ki-duk hides the true meanings away; which may also mean that he kept a secret between him and his characters against us. It&apos;s truly to see how deep a love can get with keeping it as a secret. This concept was very rare to come across. On the other hand, even though the main plot is unique, its sub-plot(plastic surgery) is not.\n\nIn cinema history, there are notable films within various genres featuring plastic surgery. Starting to count, let&apos;s look at the drama/romance genre first: In Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s popular drama movie &quot;Ash Wednesday(1973)&quot;, Taylor&apos;s character tends to have plastic surgery for the same reason as Seh-Hee herein, to retain her lover&apos;s attention on her. From the recent years, Alejandro Amenabar&apos;s &quot;Abre Los Ojos&quot; and its Hollywood copycat &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; tell the off-base story of a playboy&apos;s lose of his handsome face due to a traffic accident, and his captious dreams of regaining his face with plastic surgery. From the TV, 2005&apos;s Golden Globe winner TV-drama &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; was taking its departure with two plastic surgeons of opposite personalities.\n\nPlastic surgery was also memorable in Robert Zemeckis&apos;s &quot;Death Becomes Her(1992)&quot; where Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn were making up a fun out of this subject. Addictive to look younger, these aged ladies were competing with each other via having plastic surgeries until they explore a youth elixir. Another funny example of a plastic surgery comedy had been featuring in a scene in Terry Gilliam&apos;s &quot;Brazil(1985)&quot; where the leading character&apos;s mother wants to have plastic surgery without anaesthesia while she&apos;s wide-awake. Whereas in the horror genre, the plastic surgery has used very seriously. The cult filmmaker Jesus Franco&apos;s &quot;Faceless(1987)&quot; was a psychopathic crime story, in which a plastic surgeon kidnaps a beautiful model to stitch up her face into his sister&apos;s. Dated 1960 the British horror &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; told another crime story of a plastic surgeon who takes his patients prisoner to work as models at a circus of horrors. Maybe the earliest example to a plastic surgery concept on the silverscreen was Humphrey Bogart&apos;s &quot;Dark Passage(1947)&quot;. This was an unique crime/thriller movie, having Humphrey Bogart as a criminal&apos;s new face after the plastic surgery which made it easier for him to hide away from the police. In the other crime/thriller movies that used plastic surgery in its content, Michael Caine&apos;s &quot;The Jigsaw Man&quot; displayed a KGB agent who sent to Britain for misleading targets. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage&apos;s &quot;Face Off&quot; on the other hand, brought a fresh idea of shifting agents with each other by means of plastic surgery. Looking at a Turkish TV epic of crime genre &quot;Kurtlar Vadisi&quot; displayed a MIT spy becoming a Mafia boss after a successful plastic surgery altering into a new identity.\n\nFor now, the last sample of this plot is Shi gan, which is among the top ten most important movies of the decade through its unique cinema language. Shi gan develops a story from separation of lovers and connects it with plastic surgery, then climbs up the relationship ladder to become a cure for parted couples. It&apos;s a must-see for everyone who is seeking a good drama to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Robot Monster is the Citizen Kane of abysmal 1950s science fiction. It has everything modern viewers have come to expect from movies of this genre: a laughable plot line, completely improbable situations, ludicrous acting, unbelievably awful special effects, cheapjack production values, gaffes galore, and examples of how to fail miserably at every major aspect of motion picture production. For good measure it also sports easily the most ridiculous &quot;monster&quot; in the history of film! The plot is so thin that it can&apos;t even be stretched comfortably over the film&apos;s 66-minute running time without generous padding. A family, headed by the requisite German-accented scientist and including a &quot;hot&quot; chick, a &quot;manly&quot; guy, and two cutesy-poo kids wander through the desert after Earth has been annihilated by a guy in a gorilla suit wearing a plastic diving helmet. That&apos;s basically it, except for some nonsensical pap about an immunity serum. When the guy in the monkey suit is far and away the best actor in the picture, you&apos;ve got a MAJOR problem--but compared to John Mylong as &quot;The Professor,&quot; Ro-Man is Laurence Olivier. You could drive a semi through the plot holes. The dialogue clangers pile up like horseshoes on George H.W. Bush&apos;s lawn. You feel embarrassed for director Phil Tucker, and almost ashamed to laugh at this movie when you learn that the bad reviews of the film drove him to attempt suicide. The experience of watching this film, even with its abnormally short running time, is so excruciating that it feels like you&apos;ve wasted five hours of your life. It&apos;s so bad that after a while you begin to marvel at its very badness, and ultimately you come away awe-stricken.\n\nI call it a masterpiece because under normal circumstances only a talented and determined genius could make a film that sinks as low and violates so many rules of film-making, storytelling and suspension of disbelief as this one does. It takes real talent to make Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick, but Phil Tucker pulled it off. For that alone he deserves a place in film history.",

But if he is going to do it, it&apos;s going to be HIS way.\n\nI bet that&apos;s the one-liner directors Derek Yee and Lo Chi-Leung gave executives that got them the green light.\n\nViva Erotica is maybe the first serious film that gets away with showing female breasts and still being a magnificent work of art - at least that I know of.\n\nThe film satirizes the film industry&apos;s (Hong Kong&apos;s and global) obsession with sex in a very original way: by making a sex film.\n\nDirectors Derek Yee and Lo Chi-Leung also wrote the script, with Ka Man being a third writer. Most of the credit goes to them for the innovative premise and great execution, but the cast doesn&apos;t fall short either, especially Leslie Cheung as Kwok-Wing, Karen Mok as Man-Wai, and Shu Qi as Mango (particularly Shu Qi as Mango!).\n\nSimply put: one of the best films I have ever watched.",

Every inch of the picture area was used by the cinematographer for important information. If you watch the horrible, cropped pan-and-scan version, which is all you can get on either VHS or Laser Disc, you are missing close to 40% of the intended picture area and a great deal of important stuff! I&apos;ve seen this desecrated version and, be warned, you will not even understand the final flashback revelation because it is not even in the frame!! People who can&apos;t stand those &quot;black bars&quot; on the top and bottom of the screen are going to miss the entire point of this movie!! Rent or buy the DVD, which is widescreen and restores all this critical image area. Do not judge this film if you can&apos;t see it all. I have to wonder how many of the previous reviews here are based upon the unbelievably butchered VHS version."

He stars as Michelle&apos;s ex-husband in the movie and I laughed every time the both of them were on screen together.\n\nPual Rudd was fantastic in this movie and it shows what he can do when given co-top billing in a comedy. He was great in 40-year old virgin and in this he is no different.\n\nThe movie has the same type of feel of Clueless, as it should, their both directed by the same person. Give this movie a chance, it was funny and kept you entertained throughout the whole movie.\n\nI didn&apos;t give too much detail as you can tell, i just wanted to let you know a little bit of what to expect and how well the actors/actress&apos;s come together in this movie.\n\nGreat date movie/or a movie to take your significant other. I promise you&apos;ll both have lots of laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Love In Thoughts&quot; is a beautifully made, yet ultimately pretentious, German drama based on an event in the life of the author, Paul Krantz (who published under the name of Ernst E. Noth).\n\nThe film focuses on Paul&apos;s friendship with Guenter and his love for Guenter&apos;s sister, Hilde. This scenario is further complicated by the fact that Hilde is having an affair with Hans, a man that Guenter also loves. Paul and Guenter discuss taking their own lives, and those of their lovers, when their love has reached &quot;it&apos;s zenith&quot;. Over the course of a weekend, Paul and Guenter are rejected by the objects of their affection and they reach the point where they have to decide whether or not to go through with their murder/suicide pact.\n\nMy biggest objection to the film is the treatment of Paul and Guenter&apos;s fatalistic view of love. Their actions are treated as grandiose and tragic. Personally, I&apos;m not sure what is particularly heroic or romantic about two losers who turn homicidal/suicidal when their imaginary lovers reject them. This problem is compounded by the fact that Hilde and Hans are so unappealing. Hilde is the town bike, who not only disrespects her brother&apos;s emotions but is also rude to her best friend. Hans, on the other hand, is a chef with bad teeth, who doesn&apos;t appear to have anything going for him at all.\n\nDespite the film&apos;s general pretentiousness and self importance, it does have many things to offer. Firstly, the actors. I enjoyed Daniel Bruehl&apos;s portrayal of Paul. He is a little bit pouty but the subtlety of his performance is a huge relief in comparison to August Diehl&apos;s hammy turn as Guenter. The film offers the chance to view another fine actor in Thure Lindhardt, who plays the creepy Hans. Furthermore, the film looks absolutely fantastic. The cinematography is stunning. The landscape is captured beautifully and a scene in which the teenagers get high on absinthe is wonderful filmed.\n\nThis is an accomplished film but by no means a great one. Despite its significant beauty, &quot;Love In Thoughts&quot; is ultimately hollow and insubstantial."

God-fearing and unabashedly pro-America, yet with such a gentle, humane way about him, even when he mentions that Ezra Pound should have been shot for treason for his fascist activities in Italy during the war.\n\nA couple of quotes: &quot;Some people like to think it starts with a phrase or something; I think it starts with a mood. As Poe said somewhere, you know, he never - he wrote lots of prose and he had a hard life and died at 40, the poor boy. But he said he never touched the poetry, except when, you know, with something - &quot;the sacred touch.&quot; And that&apos;s a strong word for it, but that feeling that you could never do it unless you - never do it to pay a bill, because you probably won&apos;t.&quot;\n\n&quot;You know, I&apos;ve often said that every poem solves something for me in life. I go so far as to say that every poem is a momentary stay against the confusion of the world. But of course, any psychiatrist will tell you that so is making a basket, or making a horseshoe, or - giving anything form gives you a confidence in the universe that it has form, see? When you talk about your troubles and go to somebody about them, you&apos;re just fool, you know the best way to settle them is to make something that has form...&quot;",

Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for it&apos;s awfulness.\n\nI&apos;ve never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it&apos;s impossible to follow what&apos;s going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what&apos;s happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts? \n\nBring the puke bag.\n\nI guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits jarring your eyes.",

While this makes them local heroes, it also sets sympathetic detective Willem Dafoe on their trail.\n\nThe story is reminiscent of the &apos;Death Wish&apos; series, without the glossy superficiality of the Bronson films. At times funny, at times disturbing, it never loses momentum, with a twist ending is both satisfying and thoroughly insane! \n\nWhile the violence is graphic, the story is character-driven, and never allows the executions to overwhelm the plot. You actually like the brothers, and may be hard-pressed NOT to root for them, even if you do feel a bit guilty about it!\n\nThe Boondock Saints is a fabulous film, one that deserves your attention!"

      "reviewBody": "One crime, multiple vantage points. Sounds cool right? Yes. But &quot;Vantage Point&quot; never really pulls it off quite how it sets itself up to. The result is a cool action flick with some clever storytelling that sort of fizzles in the end.\n\nIn &quot;Vantage Point,&quot; the President of the United States (William Hurt) arrives in Salamanca, Spain to give a speech on global terrorism efforts and ties with Spain to improve them. He gets shot and then a bomb goes off killing many people. We get this story through the eyes of a variety of characters and by the end of the film know exactly what happened.\n\nThe cast is a solid mix of familiar and old faces. Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, Matthew Fox (of LOST fame) and even Sigorney Weaver give this film the star power it requires. The terrorists are entirely new faces, which is no real surprise.\n\nAs the film first presents the vantage point concept, the first thirty or forty-five minutes develop a redundancy. You do get many new perspectives, but seeing the same events happen over and over again and the cheesy rewind sequences to establish a change in POV really gets a bit boring. Sometimes you&apos;re not really seeing something new, just the same old thing in a new way that doesn&apos;t really bring more insight into the plot. Sometime it does and it really helps the film, but mostly it&apos;s not the vantage points, but cutting the story off at pivotal moments and clues into the mystery so that when they&apos;re revealed in another perspective you can get excited. It&apos;s just good storytelling, nothing unique.\n\nThe film really loses its appeal, however, with the &quot;final perspective.&quot; In fact, it&apos;s not really anyone&apos;s perspective. The writers sort of realized that adding five more perspectives to reveal the full mystery (which is what it would have taken) would really bother viewers and get absurdly repetitive, so they combined them all into a final twenty minute action sequence that is like any other normal action movie. \n\nWas deviating from the concept in order to please viewers and keep the film short the best course of action? For this film, yes. Sticking to the concept would have made it bad considering the complexity of the plot. But even the ending can also be seen about 15 minutes prior to when it happens, so it&apos;s not really all that great. This film would have been better, however, if it could both stay true to the structural concept and please the viewer, which means first-time writer Barry Levy stretched his idea just a bit too far. ~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/",

The story is unoriginal but this was not a film made for its originality. The film does have a few funny moments and lots of nudity and things alike, like drugs and parties but they all seem a bit dull and slow. The film falls way short of movies such as &quot;American Pie&quot; &amp; &quot;Road Trip&quot; even though more &quot;naughty&quot; stuff happens in this film and is more explicit, those films know how to use these elements for suspense and laughter this film just throws all them in an hopes it works.",

Thanks to the pull of police commissioner Mario Carotenuti, who lives in the same apartment building as her, she does so, because her beauty is exceeded only by her dedication and her ineptness. She is not alone in the last quality, as her supervisor, Gigi Ballista, cannot make anything work in his office, whether it is the water cooler or the telephone.\n\nThose, combined with every man she meets wanting to rape her, are the primary jokes in this very low-brow but funny Italian farce. In between the gags and the camera ogling Signorina Fenech&apos;s thighs there is some criticism of the corruption of Italian bureaucracy, common, alas, to every power structure. But mostly it&apos;s a light-hearted and dirty-minded comedy with a few good laughs and, in the copy I saw, some bad editing.",

      "reviewBody": "I am amazed at some of the earlier comments on this board concerning this picture. One wonders why the people who hate it with such a passion bothered to contribute to the comments at all? This film is an acquired taste to be sure but I happen to like movies of this sort.\n\nAdmittedly Lon Chaney did very few things in the 60&apos;s that could be called &quot;memorable&quot;. THE HAUNTED PALACE and WITCHCRAFT are the only things that come to mind. (Let us forget about FACE OF THE SCREAMING WEREWOLF entirely and that story about Edward D. Wood directing the scene of Chaney climbing the outside of the building is probably hooey.)\n\nAny movie that opens with Lon singing the title song (it was released as a .45 with Bobby Pickett&apos;s &apos;Monsters Holiday&apos; on the &quot;A&quot; side)moves on to a cameo by Mantan Moreland who pops up long enough to get himself killed and which quickly segues to Chaney as surrogate patriarch to a totally insane family can&apos;t be all bad. The Merrye Family is definitely one that you would not want to live nextdoor to. I get the feeling Rhoda Penmark from THE BAD SEED would enjoy hanging around with the 2 sisters (Beverly Washburn and Jill Banner) and Ralph (Sid Haig) can cause shudders just by entering a room.\n\nIs this movie a cult classic? Yes! Some people will not take to it right away (qv, some of the other comments on this board) but if you go into it expecting black comedy you will not be disappointed. Sure go ahead and rent this one. It may take more than one viewing but I think, if you keep an open mind, you might learn to like it.\n\nPS: If you want to catch one of Beverly Washburn&apos;s earliest performances check out SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN. She is the little girl whose home is visited by the creatures from beneath the Earth. If you want to see more of Jill Banner, start watching reruns of &apos;Dragnet&apos;."

      "reviewBody": "A typical &quot;zany&quot; Asian comedy, with the usual overacting and mugging... It does make a bit more sense and is probably funnier if you&apos;ve lived in Asia awhile and grasp the archetypes and the social situations. But it&apos;s nothing special. Western comedies work more along the lines of playing it &apos;straight&apos; - the characters in a comedy are not supposed to be aware that what they are doing is comedic. Only the main character, played by Zheng Xu, handles it this way - presumably because he is the &apos;straight man&apos;. You can tell that he can actually act. \n\nThe movie is an excellent travelogue for Thailand (though there are no actual Thai characters - apparently, Thailand is a landscape and a bunch of featured activities, and the people who inhabit it - indeed created it - are somewhat irrelevant.) It has sparked a craze of Chinese tourists coming to Chiang Mai in droves, wanting only to retrace the characters&apos; steps and check the same activities off the bucket list... \n\nThai media reports say that the influx of hacking,spitting, bossy, blunt and stingy mainland Chinese is driving the much more natty locals a bit nuts. In response to this distaste, the Chinese government recently issued a 64-page booklet of Do&apos;s and Don&apos;ts (mostly Don&apos;ts), urging Chinese tourists to represent their country better by not spitting out bones on restaurant floors and flushing the toilet after taking a dump.",

      "name": "Exhilarating Paean to the Human Spirit and Artistic Expression",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Rize&quot; rises above anthropological curiosity to be an exhilarating paean to the human spirit.\n\nIt is parallel to &quot;Bastards of the Party&quot; in noting how devastating gang violence, drugs and poverty have been to the social structure of African-Americans living in South Central Los Angeles and how young people desperately seek alternative families for emotional support. But debut director David LaChapelle (and a graduate and proponent of arts education programs) documents the power of artistic expression in literally saving souls and lives, here through a spontaneously indigenous, organized form of hip hop dancing.\n\nIt is &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; acted out before our eyes as this is self-help, bootstraps up through specifically African-American Christian culture that grew out of birthday party celebrations, going from clown dancing to crumping.\n\nI was thinking of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;&apos;s refrain of &quot;Everything was beautiful at the ballet&quot; of girls escaping dysfunctional families even before these hyper-articulate entertainers point out that there are no ballet classes available to them, or any after-school activities for kids not interested in football or basketball so they made the choice to dance with organized groups, first in informal than structured competitions.\n\nNo white talking head experts are needed in this film, though it is not clear how much influence LaChapelle had over the participants&apos; self-awareness over the three years he was making the film, as we only hear his voice a couple of times asking questions, usually of their mothers. For example, L&apos;il C says such dancing is &quot;in our blood&quot; -- but is that after LaChapelle showed them the footage of African ritual dancing that they had never seen before -- and it is a bit disconcerting that of all the footage he could have selected he uses material from the Leni Riefenstahl archives. Ethnomusicologist Nick Spitzer of Public Radio&apos;s American Routes show could certainly teach them all something about the recurring phenomenon in the African diaspora of similar competitive &quot;families&quot; created around dancing and costumes or make-up, including the samba clubs in Brazil, the Mardi Gras &quot;Indians&quot; of New Orleans and the carnival crews of the Caribbean.\n\nLaChappelle carefully introduces us to the participants as dancers and individuals before we know more about their difficult pasts and home lives, as these are young people who had to grow up too fast and are lucky to have survived, even as they can&apos;t avoid the neighborhood&apos;s random violence. We also see that these are the kind of individuals who are naturally nurturing and mentor-seeking, as one explanation of how they sought out the arts and why dance speaks to them as a mechanism to work out their emotions.\n\nThe sound track assiduously avoids degrading commercial hip hop selections for songs that reflect the spirit of the dancing, as the participants resoundingly note the independence of their culture from corporate forces.\n\nWhile the story line wanders a bit after the climactic Battle Zone, LaChappelle forcefully links the the dancing to Pentecostal and Baptist gospel traditions for the life affirming conclusion. The closing shots of how it has spread outside the African-American community aren&apos;t entirely convincing.\n\nLaChappelle can&apos;t resist some artsy music video type shots of beautiful, glistening bodies by the ocean, but that does serve to emphasize their dancing as an aesthetic form, even as the film does go on a bit too long and repetitively.\n\nThe interviews on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; should be included with the DVD as there is no concluding update to learn that some of the participants are now employed professionally as dancers, though we did get a glimpse that Miss Prissy is taking some formal dance training.\n\nRegardless, you do walk out uplifted and feelingly thrillingly positive about life.",

Some moments in this movie makes u cry. This movie sometimes jumps to the flashback for a certain characters. Flashback thing was a gr8 idea but it fails to show that its a flashback. Cause as i see in many movie which have flash back seq they apply some diff effect when the ongoing story turns to flash back, here only that certain thing isn&apos;t applied.\n\nThe end of the movie can be calculated cause its a love story but still it is good and happy ending which leaves you to think how beautiful love can be and what can be the definition of love.\n\nI loved movie a lot, so i recommend for every who believes in Love.",

Director/writer Shaky González was born in Chile raised in Denmark and in this comedy-adventure spoof of spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leon and Mexican bandit films of Robert Rodriguez, González spins a modern yarn about Danish gangsters. Or maybe just a tale about a dysfunctional urban family that has grown out of proportion. A couple of filmmakers are intrigued by the story of a multi-million dollar heist by a gang of thieves led by Frank Lories (Erik Holmey), a master criminal and the strongest and most feared man in Copenhagen. Also in the gang are Frank&apos;s two sons Sonny (Daniell Edwards) and Brian (Dennis Dean) and his niece Tina (Sophie Lossen-Kahlke). The other thugs-turned adversaries include Ramirez (Hector Vega Mauricio), Pucha (Sami Darr), Shameer (Mustafa Ali), Ivan (Zlatko Buric) and Tuki (Salah el Koussa). Seven years after the heist there are many different stories on how much was stolen, what happened to the gang members and what became of the stolen loot. In each telling the story looms larger. Those who leave the theater before the credits roll will miss the big picture as much will become evident as the epilogue continues behind the closing credits. There is a lot of comedy here and it comes across as a really good bad movie. I would give this a 7.0 out of 10.",

The movie has an average plot but nice sets and sceneries, shot most likely in Yugoslavia (?). I saw this movie sometime in 1975 or 76, growing up in Czechoslovakia. I remember it being quite boring - even for a 10 year old who wanted to see every cowboy-and-Indian movie in sight. This movie has since all but disappeared - and it is no loss.\n\nAfter his immigration to East Germany, &quot;Red Dean&quot; was used as a poster child for every propaganda campaign the government could think of, mainly in music and movies. Even Dr. Goebbels would have been amazed.",

It&apos;s just the right genre of creepy for me, interesting old place the girl inherits full of old clothes, etc., it has that grandma&apos;s attic feeling about it. A little Psycho, a little sixties scary-movie feel. Then the psychological twist gets folded in, along with a nice little romance and good acting. This movie is not formulaic overall, when you consider that it&apos;s almost impossible to make a scary movie of any kind that hasn&apos;t been done before. Sure, familiar elements are there, but even though the setting is modern for the period, it has a bit of a Gothic feel to it. If you like suspense and a creepy plot without the gore, this is for you.",

And this movie is written so lovingly and acted so honestly that I couldn&apos;t help but like it. This, despite the notable absence of the sensational elements in the movie, made for a wonderful film. Think about it--the basic plot is an older woman who owns her own small winery is lonely. So, her friend tries to find a man for her and so does her grown child. Talk about your simple plot! And yet it works! So if you are in the mood for something different, give this movie a try.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Three Faces of Eve&apos; tells the true story of a housewife who suffers from the condition recognized as dissociative identity disorder today. Nunnally Johnson&apos;s movie entirely focuses on the experience of Eve White, Eve Black and Jane during a period of a couple of years beginning from the time she started visiting her psychologist. This is unlike many of the 50s movies I&apos;ve seen because it deals with several adult themes such as divorce, spousal abuse, sex and childhood trauma unlike the comparatively melodramatic films that were so popular at the time. Nunnally proves to be a fine storyteller as the meticulous writing is rich, tight and full of depth and the direction is great. I liked how he showed the &apos;treatment process&apos;. It was cleverly downplayed in the story. The execution is done with skill. &apos;The Three Faces of Eve&apos; has some outstanding nuanced performances. Lee J. Cobb is restrained as Eve&apos;s psychologist but it is Joanne Woodward who carries the film. She is simply sublime. Since then there have been numerous movies on dissociative identity disorder but &apos;The Three Faces of Eve&apos; is the pioneer but that&apos;s not the reason why the movie ought to be watched because even as a stand alone, it works very well as a captivating character study."

Don&apos;t be put off that Yuen Biao&apos;s character is completely annoying, and that some of the comedy is of the &quot;guy with crossed eyes getting hit in the face&quot; variety. This movie has at least for of the most memorable scenes I&apos;ve ever enjoyed in a movie, including tailor-fu, laundry-fu, and doctor-fu. The lion dance is easily one of the coolest and most enjoyable set pieces in any kung fu movie. I saw this in a theater, and at the end of the lion dance, the entire room applauded. Both Kwan Tak-hing as Wong Fei-Hung and Sunny Yuen as White Tiger really stand out in the acting department. I&apos;ve seen more powerful villains, but never one this psychotic and aggressive. Now that I think about it, I can&apos;t remember if White Tiger ever even speaks in the movie. His presence is so strong he certainly doesn&apos;t need to. This is an odd movie that doesn&apos;t fit the usual patterns.  If you&apos;re not a fan of the Yuen Bros more goofy fare, like Taoism Drunkard, Drunken Tai-Chi or Young Taoism Fighter, see this anyway, it&apos;s much less random and silly, and the production values are very high.  Don&apos;t miss it.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;King Dinosaur&quot; takes place on a new planet that has entered our solar system. Four astronauts are sent from Earth to explore it. The plot is about what happens to them during this exploration. The science that the kids saw while watching this movie must make science teachers cringe. Everything about this new planet is laughable and the explorers are a joke. It&apos;s just like being in the woods on Earth. The monsters are ordinary earth animals and insects. Some are enlarged, some have fins or other things put on them to change their appearance and some are just the way they look on Earth. Throw in some stock footage and you have &quot;King Dinosaur&quot;. The astronauts are more on a camping trip than investigating a new planet. The two men are macho and the two women scream a lot. The so called special effects were bad in 1955 and are just laughable today. The main attraction to this movie is the humor you can find in it. The only entertainment value I found with this film was seeing how naive the characters were and how badly done the dinosaurs were. Oddly enough, it is bad enough to make it worth watching. It&apos;s good for laughs and to see what was around in the 50s. I wouldn&apos;t count on much more.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s weird how a mass assemblage of international artists contributed to an experience that felt almost totally individual-less, like it was all part of some generic collective for what is considered &quot;art.&quot; For the most part, the shorts felt like the same old art shorts you see on the festival circuits year after year. And why in God&apos;s name did they have Sean Penn represent the USA? He churned out what was possibly the worst segment - pointless &quot;big budget visual bravado, with an indie sensibility&quot; crud, with a message more heavy-handed than an afterschool special. Why didn&apos;t they get an American director who does more than ape the art world...someone with some talent and real insight...like Scorcese?\n\nThankfully, there were a few diamonds in the rough:\n\nThe &apos;Amores Perros&apos; director&apos;s segment was VERY eerie. Images of falling bodies and phone messages from people in the building and on the airplanes. It was the only segment that thrust the reality of what happened in your face and didn&apos;t dance around the subject. Of course, because it was almost imageless, the audience got confused and restless (I guess that&apos;s what happens when art-house goers see something DIFFERENT for a change).\n\n The Chilean docu segment was interesting, since the director showed us a September 11th that happened years ago, where Americans did similarly horrible things. And as soaked with pointless visuals at it was, I enjoyed the segment about Jerasualem getting bombed on 9/11 (and getting drowned out by the media blitz), mainly because the crowds and chaos were a nice contrast between every other short, where individuals just sat around and brooded about the towers.\n\nBut leave it to Japan to give us the finest entry. Their period-piece war parable that closed out the entire film was breathtaking and more relevant than all the films that directly involved 9/11.\n\nSo, in short, the whole movie is uneven as hell. It&apos;s worth watching for a few segments, just be prepared to suffer through a lot of generic crap."

      "reviewBody": "Norma Talmadge stars in a &apos;Madame X&apos; story in which the lower-class Talmadge must give up her infant son for his own good and then spends the rest of the movie suffering. When Norma catches her husband cheating on her, he calls her &apos;a common trollop&apos; -- no, I don&apos;t have that backwards -- and abandons her. After she gives birth and goes to work in a Marseilles boite -- surrounded by women who wear so little makeup they look like bad cross dressers -- her frozen-faced father-in-law appears on the scene with a court order for his grandson -- his son is dead. Desperate to make sure that her son isn&apos;t ruined as her husband had been, she gives him to an Anglican Minister&apos;s wife who looks a bit like Bing Crosby, since they are leaving their parish in Marseilles and returning to England. Miss Talmadge then spends the next couple of reels wandering around the streets of London, moderately barmy, and it all ends with a Surprising Revelation.\n\nNow normally I have little use for this sort of tripe, but Miss Talmadge is simply wonderful in it. She is not tied down, as she so often is, by wearing expensive clothes and exotic hair styles. Instead, you get to see how beautiful she is and how she really inhabits a character and world where she believes this. As a result, I found myself weeping intermittently throughout the entire proceedings.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes missing from the version I saw -- the road show version seems to have been fifteen or so minutes longer -- and decomposition had struck the leaders and two sections of two or three minutes each -- but the point of this movie is to watch Miss Talmadge act, and that she does. Magnificently.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Mia and Me&quot; is set in an imaginary world called Centopia, and has had three television series before this feature film addition to the adventures Mia has with elves, unicorns and other magical creatures.\n\nThis feature follows a similar format to the TV series, with short live action scenes bookending the animated section of film, in which the real fun happens.\n\nMia is a strong and positive role model for young girls, and in this film she faces challenges through which the film explores themes of loss, fear, and the power of friendship.\n\nAimed at a young audience, &quot;Mia and Me: The Hero of Centopia&quot; gives us a world of beauty and magic to discover as the main characters do their best to stop an evil monster, Toxor, from changing the world into a bizarre mutated version where no-one can fly and everyone must obey his every command.\n\nAll the major supporting characters from the TV series are in the film: Mo and Yuko working as a team, Onchao and Phuddle travelling with Mia, plus there are new characters Mia makes friends with along the way including a boy elf called Iko, and a Storm Unicorn. Phuddle works well as the comic side-kick, making unintentional jokes and saying whatever pops into his mind.\n\nThere are action packed scenes as the forces of good fight with the evil Toxor and his henchgoons the &quot;groundlings&quot;.\n\nWhile the quality of the animation is not that of the current Hollywood Studios the story is able to suspend the audience&apos;s disbelief aided by the excellent music and pacing of the film.\n\nAlthough there were a couple of subtle bits of dialogue making references that only the adults would understand the film would have been better if there was more for the parents to enjoy. And while the inclusion of live action scenes at the beginning and end of film maintains the format the fan based viewers will recognize these scenes aren&apos;t necessary for the actual film, and are the weakest part.\n\nStill the film is enjoyable as is, and the message about the value and power of good friends is very commendable.",

I did find some of the religious aspects over-bearing, some of the script rather stilted(Petronious&apos; philosophical lines excepted) and a little rambling and bloated in the story and pace. Problems aside, Quo Vadis is a film of visual spectacle and grandeur. You can never go wrong with sweeping cinematography, lavish scope, sets and scenery and colourful costumes and Quo Vadis succeeds in all these areas. Mervyn LeRoy directs excellently, while Miklos Rosza&apos;s score is absolutely magnificent. The performances are solid, Robert Taylor does a good job playing it straight and isn&apos;t too dull and Deborah Kerr is as ravishing as ever, but it is Leo Genn playing Petronious more than admirably and especially a superb Peter Ustinov as Nero that walk away with the picture. All in all, a solid film albeit not one without its flaws. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

In fact, this problem is not only between school kids, but also between grown ups in society. What&apos;s wrong with our society? What happened in the film is no more worse than the real event &apos;Columbine High School Massacre&apos; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre). When are we going to solve this problem?\n\nPerhaps showing this film to kids will make them understand how bad if they treat their mates badly.",

If you&apos;d heard of his fluid camera-work but hadn&apos;t seen a film bearing his signature this film would illustrate perfectly what people mean by his fluid camera-work. In 1952 the portmanteau film was hardly new; in England we had seen both Quartet and Trio (a joke in the early fifties had two hippies walking down Broadway and passing in turn cinemas where these titles were playing: One says &apos;Man, we better dig this crazy combo, it&apos;s fading fast&apos;) followed by Encore, all featuring short stories by Somerset Maugham but it&apos;s fair to say that all three lacked the visual style and sheer sumptuousness that Ophuls brings to DeMaupassant. Framed by The Mask and The Model the piece de resistance is The House of Madame Tellier, a four-reel examination of the role of the bordel in the provincial town - when they close for a day the whole sub-social life of the town is disturbed. If the lion&apos;s share of the plaudits go to the middle segment the others have more than their own individual moments and staples of French cinema like Jean Gabin, Danielle Darrieux and Simone Simon get to strut their stuff and pay their dues. A visual delight.",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t give this movie a high enough rating! I was a fan of Alex and Tom when they did the show &quot;The Idiot Box&quot; on MTV (one of the few who saw this), and this movie was just a natural extension of that show. If you have never seen this and have a twisted sense of humor like I do, you will love this movie. I won&apos;t rehash the plot, but I think that for me, every joke works and this is one of my all-time favorite cult movies. Randy Quaid is brilliant as Elijah C. Skuggs, the redneck proprietor of Freekland. And Alex Winter turns in a great performance in his last starring role. Thankfully &quot;Freaked&quot; is going to be released on DVD on July 12th. Thank you Anchor Bay! So, if you haven&apos;t been able to find this movie or catch it on cable, you will have your chance soon enough and I highly recommend it.\n\nOh yeah, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? TWO: One to screw it in and one to ride my RODNEY!",

      "reviewBody": "Andy&apos;s toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy&apos;s top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy&apos;s new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.\n\nGiven how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.\n\nThe plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz&apos;s turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult&apos; wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.\n\nLooking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It&apos;s hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.\n\nOverall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!"

Along for the ride are Clay Boone (Michael Callan), a handsome young felon who is sheltered by Cat and falls in love with her; Jed (Dwayne Hickman), Clay&apos;s Bible-thumping uncle, and Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini, who is hilarious), the Ballou&apos;s hired hand who philosophically comments on the treatment of Native Americans.  Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye are enjoyable as troubadours who sing the plot of the movie as it moves along.  Fonda never looked more beautiful, Marvin is a hoot (as Shelleen and his twin brother, the silver-nosed Tim Strawn), and the screenplay (by Walter Newman, Frank R. Pierson and Roy Chanslor, from his novel) is remarkable.  Memorable scenes include the opening train sequence, the brawl at the square dance, the showdown between Cat and Sir Percival (played by character actor Reginald Denny) and the conclusion at the gallows.  Delightful from start to finish! ***1/2 out of ****"

By the way, I am completely serious. &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; is a crazed mess that is so hilarious because of its stupidity that it nearly becomes a deceptive winner. This is the second film of the mid-1990s from &quot;The Tales From the Crypt&quot; HBO series (the equally under-achieving &quot;Demon Knight&quot; was released in 1995). I personally like this picture a little more because it does not take itself too seriously and almost works better as a parody. However the film never rises from its very odd premise as its tone is unclear and the immensely funny situations are sometimes over-shadowed by very graphic violence and constant sexual situations. Arguably Miller&apos;s finest performance (go figure that one too) and the steamy vampires are not quite enough to keep &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; from needing a shot for its STDs (Seriously Tedious Dilemmas). 2 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Greek-born, long-time Paris resident filmmaker Costa-Gavras (of the classic political thriller Z) had grand ambitions in making Eden Is West/Eden à l&apos;ouest. He engaged veteran playwright and screenwriter Jean-Claude Grumberg to write the dialogue. He also recruited Italian heartthrob Ricardo Scamarcio, charismatic and appealing as Elias, the mostly silent, Chaplinesque, yet gorgeous lead character, an illegal of no specific nationality (when he briefly speaks his own tongue, it&apos;s a made-up language) aiming through thick and thin to get to Paris. A very modern story meant to engage universal sympathies was the aim.\n\nBut in the event, Elias&apos; adventures seem little more than a motley series of improvisations, some lurid, some hairy, some comical, unable to form into anything lastingly memorable, touching, or meaningful. Scamarcio shows himself an excellent mime and is sympathetic throughout. Elias is a chameleon whose ability to insert himself into almost every situation he enters borders on the fantastic. When he talks about the film, Costa-Gavras mentions globalization, the exploitation of immigrants, world poverty, the wanderings of Ulysses. But &apos;Eden Is West&apos; winds up being mostly just the picaresque tale of a young charmer, attractive to men and women, trusted by all, endlessly resilient, surviving on minimal sleep and a diet of hastily grabbed croissants and gulps of coffee, shedding garments and identities with equal alacrity. And that&apos;s all very well, but so what? If this is &apos;Candide,&apos; it&apos;s &apos;Candide&apos; without the enlightenment or the political savvy.\n\nElias&apos; adventures begin when he jumps off a boat full of illegals as the coast guard approaches, and is one of several young men who lands, alive, on a posh island resort called &quot;Eden&quot; that has nude bathing as one of its entertainments. The film holds our attention and sets the theme: Elias is always in danger of getting found out and hauled away. We hold our breath as he runs just ahead of the cops or security. Awekening the next morning on the island, he strips naked to fit in, turns into a bellboy by donning an &quot;Eden&quot; jacket, get kissed by a gay hotel host, is forced to repair a jammed toilet by an Israeli, and is adopted as a bed-mate by horny German widow Christina (Juliane Koehler) during a spectacular rainstorm. This resort sequence is slickly done, more extended and more emotionally engaging than the precipitous road picture that soon follows. But it also reads as a segment out of a soft-core B picture: in terms of setting tone and focus, it gets things off to an unpromising start. Things are too easy and too random. The first twenty minutes show the flaws of the whole 110-minute film. Costa-Gavras is adept at convincingly establishing his kaleidoscopic sequence of milieus. But not so good at making a logical arc of the adventures.\n\nElias&apos; ability to fall easily into any role leads him to serve not only as a hotel underling and as Christina&apos;s lover, but also as the assistant of the Eden resort&apos;s German resident magician, Nick Nickelby (Ulrich Tukur). Later he escapes the resort and finds himself working for a traveling vendor, recruited at a clandestine electronics recycling factory, and donning various disguises to evade the cops. He&apos;s a fugitive, cut-rate Felix Krull manqué, and there&apos;s the suspicion from the start that all these things are temptations the delay this Ulysses from finding his Ithaka--which may be the Paris nightclub where Nick Nicholby tells him he usually works. Nickelby says, &quot;If you come to Paris, come and see me,&quot; and through his travels, Elis keeps struggling to get this sentence in French memorized, and to make it to the Paris nightclub and the magician. Nobody knows his language, and his hold on French is shaky; hence the value of Scamarcio&apos;s expressive mouth and big, soulful eyes.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to see what the point is of the rich, squabbling Greek couple (Ieroklis Mihailidis and Annie Loulou) or the gang of gypsies who at first think him one of theirs, or the louche pair of German truckers (Antoine Monot, Florian Martens) who leave him off at a crossroads between the routes to Hamburg and to Paris. More adventures and narrow escapes follow, and Elias does eventually make it to the City of Light and find the magician. \n\nApparently Costa-Gavras meant to keep his treatment of an illegal&apos;s travails on the way to gainful employment in the European Union lighthearted, but the various episodes just aren&apos;t memorable or meaningful enough. This is a great role for Ricardo Scamarcio, or might have been; unfortunately the project seems too ill conceived to have lasting value.\n\nEden à l&apos;ouest opened in Paris February 11, 2009 to mediocre reviews. It was shown as part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, March 2009. 110 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "Story of the 2004 Presidential Campaign between incumbent President GW Bush and Democratic challenger John F. Kerry which, in the opinion of many political observers, Kerry and the Democratic Party let slip right through their fingers and ended up on the losing end of the vote.\n\nThe film follows John Kerry&apos;s winning the Democratic Party&apos;s nomination for President in Boston in July to his self destruction over the next four months when he blew a double digit lead in the polls against President Bush to end up losing in the November elections by 50.7 % to 48.3 % of the popular vote! Thus legitimizing Bush&apos;s 2000 victory in which he won the electoral but lost the popular vote to his Democratic Party opponent for president Al Gore.\n\nDespite Kerry&apos;s outstanding, to Bush&apos;s non-existent, military record in Vietnam the Republican strategists, headed by Karl Rove, actually used it against him in falsifying it by claiming that all his medals were somehow fraudulent especially Kerry&apos;s three Purple Hearts! Kerry reacted to these false charges by mostly ignoring them which lead many voters to feel that they were actually true which they weren&apos;t!\n\nThis &quot;swift boat&quot; smear campaign by the Republicans had Kerry going on the defensive for the remainder of the Presidential Campaign as his lead in the polls evaporated together with his claims of being a genuine war hero! John Kerry who was a hero in Vietnam now turned out to be a first class wimp, by letting Bush &amp; the Republicans step all over him, when running for the highest office in the land.\n\nOn Election Day 2004 it looked like Kerry was going to pull it out and win the Presidency for the Democratic Party with him, for once, leading in a number of key states that he needed to win the White House. The most crucial state being the Buckeye state of Ohio with its 20 electoral votes. It was also Ohio that the Republicans targeted with a massive get out the vote campaign which the Democrats failed to match. The Republicans-who politically controlled the state- also bottled up a number of key Democratic precincts, with disruptive poll watchers and a lack of voting machines. As it turned out the final results in Ohio mirrored the elections total 50 state results with Bush besting Kerry, after being behind in the early voting by as much as 28%, 50.7% to 48.3%.\n\nWhat the film &quot;So Goes the Nation&quot; made crystal clear is how the Democrats blew an election that they were sure to win by smugly trying to take the high road in winning it. Politics is a dirty business and to win in it you&apos;ve got to pull out all stops in pounding your opponent into submission just short of ending up, like Richard M. Nixon, breaking the law. \n\nThe Republican strategy was to attack Kerry&apos;s strong points like his service in Vietnam and have him defend it as if it was detrimental not positive in him getting elected president. The Kerry people let Bush off the hook in defending their candidate&apos;s brilliant war record while Bush who did everything to avoid serving in the war ended up getting a free ride.\n\nThese attacks on Kerry had the public, especially in Ohio, overlook the downturn in the economy and the disastrous Iraqi War which if brought out by Kerry and the Democratic Party would have easily given Kerry the Presidency! In the end the clueless, in how to win a Presidential Election, Democratic Party proved that famous saying &quot;Good Guys Finish last&quot; which they by trying to be goody two shoes, and letting themselves get kicked all over the place, totally turned the American public against them! All these political miscalculations by Kerry and the Democratic Party had GW Bush voted in for a second term by the majority of the American voters which in retrospect turned out to be against, for most of those who voted for him, their best interest!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a kind of a silly spy spoof like the ones that were big in Europe at the time. Jess Franco did any number of them (&quot;Kiss Me Monster&quot;, &quot;The Girl from Rio&quot;). It also might by be loose adaptation of an Edgar Wallace mystery, which were really big in Germany where the film was produced (although more likely it&apos;s based on a work of his much less talented son, Bryan Edgar Wallace). The story involves a bunch of characters all chasing after this mineral a murdered professor has discovered that can apparently do everything from waking up patients in narcoleptic comas to turning worthless metals into gold. The mineral is really a &quot;McGuffin&quot; though, in fact, the whole plot is pretty much a McGuffin. The real fun to be had is watching all these bizarre characters crossing and double-crossing each other.\n\nFranco regulars Paul Muller and Howard Vernon are on hand, the latter playing a pretty unconvincing hired assassin. Ewa &quot;Vampyros Lesbos&quot; Stromberg also has a small role, but she keeps her clothes on this time. My favorites though are the lead villains--a husband who is apparently confined to a wheelchair and his prim, matronly wife who wields a mean sword cane! The real reason to watch this movie though can be summed up in two words: Soledad Miranda. Soledad Miranda had what the French (and a a lot non-French pseudointellectual types)called &quot;je ne sais qoi&quot; (basically &quot;I don&apos;t know what&quot;). She was very beautiful, standing out even among the many beautiful actresses Franco worked with. She was also talented having made many movies before she started working with Franco. She was always willing to take her clothes off and display her beautiful body, but she was classier and much less unabashedly exhibitionistic than her successor Lina Romay (who probably should have been more &quot;abashed&quot; about doing hardcore porn or letting Franco practically explore her colon with his zoom lens). Maybe it was because she died tragically young. She was always a sexy but ethereal actress whose erotic presence haunted even silly, nonsense movies like this.\n\nAs his fans know, Franco himself as director had a certain &quot;je ne sais qoi&quot; with some of his films. (With others though it was more like &quot;je ne sais why the hell I am watching this crap!&quot;). He&apos;s especially zoom-happy in this movie, but it actually works pretty well with the frenetic, pop-art style plot. It&apos;s not a great movie by a long shot, but the movies Franco did with Soledad Miranda are all pretty special, even the slightest ones like this."

      "reviewBody": "Code 46 is a film that puts its heart ahead of its head. Fortunately there are times when I can cherish such an endeavour so it worked for me, but I&apos;m not the sort of viewer to tune out my head entirely so it didn&apos;t entirely work. For a plot, we have an fraud investigator in a dystopian future falling for his chief suspect. There&apos;s romance and plot developments, but the romance is key, the film is a study in wistful mood over and above its narrative. The driving force is the sparking of love in a time of such uncertainty it seems near impossible, a future of uncertain (and perhaps dangerous) genetic identities and instant personality alterations. A time in which mankind has gone so far with genetic experimentation that intrusive legislation and rigid border controls are the governments only tool to keep things under control, with Tim Robbins as or protagonist working to do just that. Now the above might give the impression of science fiction intrigues in a distant new world, but the design is modern with little visually (apart from a pretty awesome road junction) to set it apart from our world, generally conversation and some cold interior designs are what creates its sense of future. As for intrigue, well this gets us to the trouble with the film. Thematically, the potential is high, but by and large the issues are little more than brought up and laid down, if brought up at all. So no serious delving into the moral and biological consequences of events, nor the problems raised by personality alteration viruses, nor even much of a process of realisation/rebellion by our lead. What&apos;s there instead is charm, a gentle look at quiet, irresponsible burgeoning romance, deftly essayed by the leads and buttressed by sweet presentation. Tim Robbins does well in suggesting a questing soul beneath a smiling, sincerely insincere exterior, while Samantha Morton is a delight as the object of his affections. With hair cut short and a childlike naiveté she near shimmers in other-world loveliness, a truly likable turn. They have fine chemistry too, so their relationship is a fine one to ride with, much aided by the cinematography and score. Some places look suitably sterile here, but a lot of places are shot with soft, dreamhaze hues as if coming to from a medicated slumber, fitting to the plot. The music, mostly from The Free Association is wistful and shoegazey, again appropriate. The ending does however really spoil the mood established by the wordless score by employing a Coldplay song. I&apos;m probably biased because I loathe Coldplay anyway but even taking that into account I don&apos;t think any vocals would really have suited the end of this one. I&apos;m in danger of selling this one perhaps more than it truly deserves, but I did like it a lot. The lack of substance is a big drawback, but maintains a near constantly pleasing tone even if I wasn&apos;t thinking much about it after viewing. 7/10 from me, one for romantics methinks.",

Seeing it again, almost two decades later, I feel the film skims the surface as Les Blank seems to have little interest in drawing out what went on. He just observes and accepts the events at face value. Only Herzog is interviewed at any length and the burden of his dream(s) does become apparent as the film progresses, however there is virtually no comment from Kinski or the other actors. Les Blank might argue that the film is about Herzog&apos;s state of mind and his attitude to the production of Fitzcarraldo. In this, I think it is largely a success. To look for more from the film is perhaps to unfairly employ the benefit of hindsight.\n\nI suspect my disappointment (relative) at seeing this again is the release of &quot;My Best Fiend&quot; in the interim. I find my memory conflating the two films, the piece about Kinski&apos;s &quot;hate hate&quot; relationship with the jungle (and almost everything else!) would seem more appropriate to &quot;Burdens&quot; but is in &quot;Fiend&quot;.\n\n&quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; and &quot;My Best Fiend&quot; would make a good double bill, giving a much more rounded impression of the context of the production of Fitzcarraldo and the relationship between Herzog and Kinski. If you are interested, try to see them both.",

Forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under scrutiny by neighbours, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall.

      "reviewBody": "The second, and arguably the best, entry in the FANTOZZI series is basically more of the same but here the results are even livelier and funnier. It goes without saying that all of the following are better watched and heard than read about and a knowledge of the Italian language is compulsory for fully appreciating this series in particular and most Italian comedies in general but, for what it&apos;s worth, here are the highlights of the film under review: \n\n1) A superstitious boss takes Fantozzi to a gambling casino where the latter is mistaken for a homosexual and is subsequently forced by his boss to drink a case of sparkling water which inevitably causes Fantozzi to emit a gargantuan belch\n\n2) The hunt which turns into a veritable battleground (complete with war tanks) and with the hunters eventually shooting on one another\n\n3) The masterstroke of the film is the sequence which shows Fantozzi revolting against a film-fanatic superior of his when the employees are forced to watch Sergei Eisenstein&apos;s THE BATTELSHIP POTEMKIN (1925) for the nth time while there is an Italy vs. England football match being shown live on TV at the same time; Fantozzi blows his top and exclaims the immortal phrase: &quot;For me, THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN is crazy s***&quot; which is met by a flurry of applause by his (for once) appreciative colleagues, after which the superior&apos;s personal copy of the film is burnt and he is then himself forced to watch for three days running GIOVANNONA LONG-THIGH (1972), THE EXORCIST - Italian STYLE (1975) and a fictitious poliziottesco THE COPS ARE MAD!; the employees&apos; eventual punishment is a weekly re-enactment of the famous Odessa steps sequence from Eisenstein&apos;s film with Fantozzi invariably being given the role of the baby in the ill-fated carriage! By the way, another favorite film of the superior to which the employees are often subjected to is Carl Dreyer&apos;s DAY OF WRATH (1943)!\n\n4) Fantozzi receives free tickets for a circus performance during a period of sickness but decides to attend just the same highly camouflaged but, of course, he is immediately recognized by a superior of his and so tries to pass himself off as a circus performer with increasingly disastrous results including being fired from a cannon\n\n5) A visit to a brothel with Reder and Anatrelli ends with the former in hospital (suffering the ire of a horde of unpaid taxi drivers) and Fantozzi himself sleeping outside his own flat as a watchdog (while the latter, who has since married Mazzamauro, goes on about his business on the inside with one of the girls they picked up)\n\n6) A disastrous escapade with Mazzamauro shows Fantozzi incompetently performing several extreme physical feats so as to prove to her that he is even better than her husband\n\n7) In the final sequence. Fantozzi goes back to work for the company as a human shield against lightning!",

      "reviewBody": "A challenge facing any reviewer is how to present a balanced picture without letting one&apos;s own feelings sway it too much either way. The same challenge must face documentary makers. How do you present &apos;facts&apos; without putting a spin on them? The first film I saw by Jenny Fox was her Flying: Confessions of a Free Woman: a six-hour marathon of her own journey to discover what it means to be a woman. My Reincarnation is mercifully brief by comparison. She returns to more traditional cinema verité, again dissecting the psyche – this time of a high Tibetan Buddhist Monk. Both his greatness and his more earthly failings – all are part of this vivid 82 minute documentary. In making it, Fox gained unparalleled access to his private and family affairs. She had little funding for the first 18 years, of what turned out to be 20 years of filming, but in spite of the title, it was all completed in a single lifetime.\n\nThe monk in question is Chögyal Namkhai Norbu. While less famous than the Dalai Lama, a quick google search shows he&apos;s right up there with revered world-famous authorities.\n\nA reason My Reincarnation took so long to complete, Fox tells me, is that there was no &apos;storyline&apos; on which to hang a commercial film. Chogyal teaches in exile, and his son (Yeshi), although also recognised as a great incarnation, prefers family life in Italy to the ascetic Buddhist path. So not a lot happens. But then, a breakthrough. The documentary had almost been abandoned when our prodigal son secretly hoofs it to Tibet to reclaim his heritage. Dad, meanwhile, is looking unwell, and a Buddhist foundation wants to preserve the teachings. So they gave Fox enough funds to get things to the big screen.\n\nOur film&apos;s unhurried pace could easily make it rather unexceptional, especially to non-Buddhists: except for three things. Firstly, access to such a reclusive life is normally impossible. Secondly, the extraordinary tension between intelligent young Yeshi, who wants wants to see father as nothing special, and Dad with his hoards of adoring acolytes. By giving both characters equal weight, Fox explores Tibetan Buddhist tradition from the angles of both believers and sceptics. The third factor is Fox herself as a filmmaker. She has an unnerving ability to turn navel-gazing into life-changing. Her daunting self-exposé, Flying Confessions, was even serialised on television. Now, her mantra-laden, bell-ringing, Himalayan odyssey is disarmingly down-to-earth.\n\nWhile there is, for Buddhist audiences at least, enough &apos;meat on the bone&apos; as Fox puts it (a curious expression – as most Buddhists are vegetarians, Tibetans often being an exception), she maintains a director&apos;s crucial impartiality in the final edit. Yeshi&apos;s irritation is displayed without totally wrecking the character of the old master. But we also get to see the latter as merely human. Brief monologues are impressive. Basic Buddhist teachings include observing one&apos;s own mind and avoiding worship of a master (a point repeatedly overlooked, it seems to me, from the doting expressions of followers). The Dalai Lama makes several very informal appearances, laughing and joking charismatically. But the real emotional clout is launched in the final Tibetan footage. Is there anything in the prophecies? These last reels were shot without Fox&apos;s knowledge – she didn&apos;t even know Yeshi was going. Miraculous intervention or an overpowering sense of duty? The whole thing can still look a bit woolly to this viewer, but it works dramatically and impressively for the community of Dzogchen Buddhists. Chögyal Namkhai Norbu might not be a divinity from on high, but he gives sound advice to people desperately in need. His practices have given him fortitude and focus. Not a bad role model – even as a mere father.\n\nFor sceptics, Tibetan Buddhism&apos;s shortcomings when running a modern-day sanctuary are highlighted. Early in the film, Yeshi introduces modern business strategy to enable many more people than would have been envisaged in the original Buddhism to get on well with each other. In this sense, the West brings something to the East. &quot;This,&quot; as Fox proclaims, &quot;is the future. If they can get through it.&quot; Whatever your beliefs, shake yourself at the end of the movie and remember: this is real life documentary, not fiction. The chrysalis of documentary movie-making transforms itself into moving evidence.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee&apos;s character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "The Cannes Film Festival has had its fare share of controversy and throughout the 1950&apos;s it was dominated less by artistic than by political considerations. The year 1956 was its worst in this regard with no less than six films withdrawn as a consequence of diplomatic skirmishes. The Festival Committee had at least the courage to show Resnais&apos; &apos;Nuit et Brouillard&apos; despite disapproval from both the French and German governments but &apos;A Town like Alice&apos; was culled so as not to offend the Japanese whilst Helmut Kautner&apos;s &apos;Himmel ohne Sterne&apos; fell victim to protests from the Russians. This latter film has since come to be regarded as one of Kautner&apos;s most powerful if least known.\n\nThe doomed lovers Anna and Carl are touchingly played by Eva Notthaus in what is arguably her finest role and the likeable Erik Schumann with sterling support from the always good value Eric Ponto and Lucie Hoeflich as Anna&apos;s parents. There is also a taking performance from Horst Bucholz very early in his career as a Russian soldier who inadvertently contributes to the couple&apos;s fate.\n\nAdapted from his own novel, Herr Kautner&apos;s direction is masterful and builds in intensity throughout and although we sense from the outset that Love will not conquer all, the last ten minutes of the film are shattering in their impact whilst the final solitary shot of boy actor Rainer Stangl as Anna&apos;s son is as emotionally telling as that of Brigitte Fossey being swallowed up by the crowd in Clément&apos;s &apos;Jeux Interdits&apos;.\n\nMy admiration for this director knows no bounds and it is to be lamented that perhaps because of the vagaries of film distribution, he remains unappreciated outside his own country. He rose above the politics of the Nazi era and his genius represents a beacon in the cultural wasteland of post-war German cinema.",

This feature film is a Crystal Heart Award Winner and is eligible to be the Grand Prize Winner in October of 2008. The Heartland Film Festival is a non-profit that honors Truly Moving Pictures. A Truly Moving Picture &quot;explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.&quot;\n\nKarla is a 10 year-old Danish girl that faces an all too common problem around Christmas-time. She wants to have a traditional, old-fashioned holiday season, but is part of an extended family. She has a father with a drinking problem who lives alone. She lives with her Mother and Stepfather and brother and step-brother. The logistics are hard and everybody is so busy.\n\nShe finally concludes, &quot;grown-ups don&apos;t care about Christmas.&quot; And this will be &quot; (her) worst Christmas ever.&quot; \n\nKarla finds a respite with an eccentric older man called Buster. It&apos;s hard to tell whether Karla is watching over Buster or Buster is watching over Karla. But at least they have each other.\n\nKarla&apos;s despair and quest for holiday joy might make her family re-examine their lives  or maybe it won&apos;t. Karla has a lot to teach all of us if we will only stop being busy and listen and watch.\n\nFYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",

      "reviewBody": "The city of London has featured in innumerable films - a vast, intensely varied metropolis, it has served as a vivid backdrop countless times. From the sun-drenched banks of the Thames in &apos;Four Weddings and a Funeral&apos; to the gloomy squalor of Camden Town in &apos;Withnail &amp; I&apos; it is always an interesting setting for a story. But in &apos;Wonderland&apos;, directed by Michael Winterbottom (&apos;Jude&apos;, &apos;Welcome to Sarajevo&apos;), it almost gains a life of its own.\n\nSuperficially a story of the day-to-day lives of three sisters, Wonderland is more about the city and the millions of people who live in it than the troubled family the plot centres on. They are Nadia (Gina McKee), a single woman desperately in search of friendship and romance, Debbie (Shirley Henderson), a single mother with a young son (Peter Marfleet) and Molly (Molly Parker), a pregnant woman whose husband (John Simm) is having doubts.\n\nThe camera follows them (mostly Nadia) as they travel through the busy streets of the capital. It does not concentrate on just the characters, often lingering on faces and groups, giving the film a real-life edge. This is added to by the hand-held camera work and the slightly grainy quality of the image, which is as though a much larger picture has been magnified to concentrate on these people.\n\nThe stories themselves are uniformly (and depressingly) realistic, although they all end on a high note, leaving the viewer surprisingly upbeat. Winterbottom has a knack of coaxing great performances from good actors and does not fail here, with the quietly miserable couple of Kika Markham and Jack Shepherd as the sisters&apos; parents standing out.\n\nWonderland will never break any box office records and is certainly not flawless, but it is an admirable film and it warms the cockles of this reviewer to see such worthy films still being made in Britain.",

      "reviewBody": "Surrogate Woman is South Korean master Im Kwon-Taek&apos;s breakout international success, a film that would in many ways presage his critically acclaimed Chunhyang. The period drama occurs in the Yi dynasty, and covers the progress of a love affair gone terribly awry. Shin, a young heir, is given a surrogate wife to bear his child. However, Ok-nyo becomes more than this for him, and the couple soon become passionate lovers. The woman may have the social status of a servant, but the relationship changes both of them -- at least for a time. Lead actress Kang Soo-Yeon has been widely acclaimed in her role as the surrogate mother. Unfortunately, the film frequently wears its heart on its sleeve, almost forcing its emotionalism on you in the process. The events are traumatic, to be sure, and one is set to wonder about the plight of so many women even less fortunate than Ok-nyo. The overwhelming feeling is that a woman&apos;s emotional core has been gutted and spread out for all to see; it&apos;s more wrenching than many a blood and guts actioner. It lacks the distance of his later masterpieces like Sopyonje and Festival -- both equally tragic."

This is a difficult film, but that&apos;s the way they should be (with a theme like that).\n\nOf course you could argue, that the ending isn&apos;t the one you would imagine, but hopefully the movie has gotten to you until this point, so that you can identify with the persons at some basic level. I liked it and I think it has some very interesting questions (that again won&apos;t be answered in the movie). Not an easy movie then, but if that&apos;s your cup of tea, you will be very pleased here",

      "reviewBody": "BING CROSBY gives his all to the role of a washed up actor fixated on guilt (and the bottle) while GRACE KELLY and WILLIAM HOLDEN give even finer performances as the two people who quarrel over how to reform his guzzling ways.\n\nThe weakness here is not the script. It&apos;s the dull musical numbers assigned to Crosby, who carries them off in the usual amiable Crosby manner, before he reverts to character as Frank Elgin. Nevertheless, when he&apos;s down and out, he gives a very painfully convincing portrait of a weak alcoholic man who shifts all of the blame to his wife. I suspect Clifford Odets may have based his portrait of this weak man on actor Frank Fay (once married to Barbara Stanwyck), whose career was destroyed by alcoholism and who depended on breezy charm for his appeal.\n\nThere are some really searing scenes between Kelly and Holden, fireworks that never seem less than realistic as a result of two completely realized characters that come to life in a well-written script. Holden is particularly fine in a difficult, demanding role that forces him to gradually shift his sympathy as he realizes who the real culprit is. His performance is the strongest of the three stars.\n\nGrace Kelly subdues her aristocratic ways (and her prissy affected manners and voice) to play a woman who knows what the truth is behind her husband&apos;s weakness. She looks as forlorn and beaten as the script requires, always completely in touch with her character&apos;s moods and feelings. There are little nuances all along that show what a fine actress she could be under superb direction and given some brilliant dialog.\n\nFascinating as a portrait of theater people, but a letdown whenever it strays into the producing of a show that looks to be as feeble as any amateur production could be with hopes of becoming Broadway bound.\n\nNeverthelss, a gritty, searing, truthful drama that is well worth watching for the performances alone.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been made by different production companies (Sintra, K2, France 2 Cinéma, CNC, Eurimages) who all wanted to have their crew-member or their own cast. So this movie has no consistent personality. It is based on the book by François Vitoux (La Comédie de Terracina) which based it on the book by Henri Beyle, better knwon as Stendhal: &quot;Voyages à Rome, Naples, Florence 1817-1826&quot;. Nae Caranfil was the director and he made the script. The title: &quot;Dolce far niente&quot; suggests that the protagonists are not working and just making love; &quot;Amor, Vino e Revolutione&quot;.  Stendhal became later consul at Civittavecchia but this story happened during the twenties when he came for the first time in Italy and at that time he wrote articles about music and the arts. The fight against the revolutionaries gives the movie some action but most of the time it is a romance in a historical context. So Stendhal (François Cluzet) falls in love with Josphine (Isabella Ferrari). Everybody is calling Rossini &quot;Maestro&quot; and the countess is just a fan of him. It is not clear if Stendhal should have encountered Rossini (a wooden Pierfrancesco Favino) but this ads some historical figure to the weak script. This movie is just entertainment and is not pretentious but one wonders if you learn something more about Stendhal or Rossini.",

It is both simplistic and elegant at the same time.\n\nThere&apos;s no time for idle reflections, it goes almost straight to the action. Normally I wouldn&apos;t like that, but it worked well for this movie. It was short, and to the point.\n\nI will keep this in my collection along with Akira, Final Fantasy, Princess Mononoke amongst others. A small but bright gem."

      "reviewBody": "Repossessed (1990) \n\n* 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nSeventeen years after having the Devil removed from her soul, adult Nancy Aglet (Linda Blair) finds herself possessed yet again so she brings back Father Mayii (Leslie Nelson) but this time a fake preacher (Ned Beatty) wants to put it on live television to make some money. A spoof of THE EXORCIST with Linda Blair returning and Nelson coming off THE NAKED GUN should have meant a sure-fire hit but sadly this is a rather boring, unfunny and at times painfully bad movie that probably had more cash in its eye than anything else. There&apos;s so much that could have been done with the material but this is a perfect example of why certain films work and why others don&apos;t. Stuff like AIRPLANE, HOT SHOTS and THE NAKED GUN work because of the talented screenwriters who make the jokes work. Writer-director Bob Logan simply doesn&apos;t get the material to work for a number of reasons but the biggest is that the jokes are all rather lame and just seem forced. One such example of Blair fixing her kids pea soup. Another has a priest saying something about &quot;head&quot; and it of course being taken the wrong way. The stuff with the preacher and his wife is so forced and annoying that it just never gets any laughs. Even worse is how the story structure is because for the most part we see Nelson teaching in front of a class and then we see the &quot;other&quot; story dealing with Blair. We go back and forth between the two and usually we get Nelson making a few comments but those two are unfunny. Nelson seems bored in his part and Beatty simply overplays his. Blair doesn&apos;t give a very good performance but I&apos;m not going to blame her since the material just wasn&apos;t right and she appears to really be forcing herself to try and get laughs. REPOSSESSED should have worked and probably could have worked in better hands but as it is the movie is just cheap and weak."

But after reading all the overly positive &quot;scariest movie of all time&quot; and overly negative &quot;two hours of my life I&apos;ll never get back (hour and a half actually)&quot;, I had to comment. I heard about this in Entertainment Weekly and was waiting patiently for it to come out in wide distribution. All in all, it&apos;s a good movie for what it is. A low budget horror movie using the faux documentary premise. Compared to The Blair Witch Project, where you couldn&apos;t see a damn thing to be scared of, and Cloverfield, which just made me nauseous from the jerking camera, this film at least has steady camera work most of the time. If you are a die hard horror movie fan, will this movie terrify you? Probably not, except on a psychological level possibly. The notion of a demon haunting a person as opposed to a haunted house, while nothing truly original in the sense it hasn&apos;t been done elsewhere, is still not seen to much in horror (except in possession films), least these days in the days of Saw and Hostel and other crap. There are a few startling moments in the film. They are comparable to a friend sneaking up on you from behind and shaking you. But honestly, that&apos;s what I want from a horror movie. To be in suspense and have something shock me and get my heart pumping for a few. I can&apos;t remember the last film I saw to do that so at least Paranormal Acivity got my blood flowing a couple times. But mostly its disturbing. Some of the night scenes would be slightly shocking, others would just be creepy to watch. But in each something different happens. In terms of acting, nothing spectacular but hardly as terrible as some are whining about. And while the film suffers from all other faux documentary films with the &quot;&apos;WHY ARE YOU STILL FILMING? TURN THE CAMERA OFF!&apos; &apos;I WOULD BUT THEN THERE WOULDN&apos;T BE A MOVIE TO SHOW.&apos;&quot; moments, there are actually times when the boyfriend gets yelled at to turn off the camera and does so. And his character is shown from the beginning to be stubborn, frat boyish, and egotistical. So, while his stupidity starts to wear on you, its a slightly more plausible reason for the continual filming than say Blair Witch Projects &quot;THE CAMERA IS ALL I HAVE LEFT!!!&quot; moments. To sum up, is this the scariest film of all time? No. But it is without a doubt the scariest film to be shown in the mainstream theater in the last few years. Its more terrifying then the endless remakes and sequels we have been plagued with. One thing I hope for with all the hype is that horror fans want more genuine shock moments than over the top gore.",

On the way from Pennsylvania to Delaware, their car becomes stranded in a snow bank far away from civilization. Soon they are being haunted by the ghosts of all the numerous people who died earlier in the very spot that seems intent on claiming two fresh victims.\n\n&quot;Wind Chill&quot; is a modest little horror outing whose admirable restraint and sense of atmosphere don&apos;t quite compensate for its overall lack of energy and incoherent storyline. It takes quite awhile for the plot to kick itself into gear, and even when it does, the movie ends not with a bang but with a whimper.\n\n&quot;Wind Chill&quot; is certainly preferable to an out-and-out gore-fest like &quot;Saw&quot; or &quot;Hostel,&quot; but a few more runs through the typewriter (or word processor, as the case may be) might have gone a long way towards making it a more satisfying and scary film. Like the car stuck in the snowdrift, the audience at &quot;Wind Chill&quot; ultimately finds itself stranded in the middle of nowhere.",

In short, the story was vapid and the acting was awful. They threw in some sex to titillate, but all it did was make me angry. The mad doctor is over the top yet not in a good way and he was stupid to boot. The lead Nazi was an acceptable villain, but only because his acting was not painful and he was a Nazi. The heroine seemed rather one dimensional and devoid of life (which I think was the &quot;actress&apos;&quot; fault rather than the writers&apos; or even intentional). The heroine, by the way, never actually wears those painted on &quot;pants&quot;. Ever. Sorry. This movie is neither bad enough to be good nor is it passable as late night brain dead viewing. I should have known to save my $1.02 when I saw the cover. What can I say: I have a weakness for dead Nazis and shapely hips.",

Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it.  Viewed that way I think it succeeded.  I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed.  The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see.  I&apos;m speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here.  After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it&apos;s justified due.  It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I&apos;ll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD).  I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical.",

The plot is that a search and rescue ship in deep space answers a distress beacon. For their trouble, they get Peter Facinelli. Oversexed, overly derivative mess of a film offers nothing you haven&apos;t seen before and better. Hell, just a few years before this was Event Horizon, with a very similar plot but a much better movie. A dark-haired and particularly buff James Spader gives the only performance worth mentioning with a straight face. How about that laugh-inducing ending? You wouldn&apos;t think a movie that has the names of both Francis Ford Coppola and Walter Hill attached to it could be this bad but it just goes to show I guess.",

It&apos;s not terrifying, and it will not make you hide behind your sofa or think too much, but it is creepy and well-paced. There are some jumpy moments, but the real stress is on a slow build up. For some time the presence of anything sinister is only hinted at. We see characters interacting, dark shadows in the corner, and glimpses of the past, mostly experienced by the main character, a female conductor. It is her first trip as a conductor, and the last trip for a train on that particular line, on which a terrible accident has happened years earlier. There is an atmosphere of menace, which slowly becomes more threatening as more of the characters&apos; fears and backgrounds are revealed and the train gathers speed. There are clichéd scenes, such as someone innocently picking up a coat out of which falls an important newspaper clipping, but they are not bad enough to render the film ridiculous. The effects are well done and sometimes scary, and the slow pacing, accompanied by the constant sound of the train and the subtle cinematography, make for a great atmosphere. If you enjoy spookiness and ghosts you will like this.",

      "name": "A special film with problems but overall a unique experience",
      "reviewBody": "There are films that are bad, and there ones that look bad, but hold value to them not everyone sees. Raise the Titanic, was loosely based off a novel by Clive Cussler. It is a race between the Americans and Russians trying to obtain a rare mineral that could decide who becomes the top world power. To do this, they must salvage the mineral from the Titanic. The only way to do this is by raising the Titanic; ergo the main titles. This may turn off people because the whole plot line is given away, but that shouldn&apos;t be something to squander over. It should be more of what is looked forward to. This film has a lot of good stuff in it.\n\nStarring as the main character of Cussler&apos;s stories, is Dirk Pitt, played by Richard Jordan. I can&apos;t say Jordan is the best choice but he&apos;s definitely not bad either. Jordan at least gives the character of Pitt some attitude that comes with the territory. For the most part, the entire film stays faithful to the paperback material. All the characters are in there, along with the most important scenes. One might say that this movie was thought to perform well because Alec Guinness, best known as Obi-Wan Kenobi, from Star Wars, plays a character as well in the story.\n\nOn a side note, a particular element that could have been left out of story was the relationship between Gene and Dana Seagram. The same goes for the book but the way the situation was handled here was half-baked. From beginning to the midway point, there were various scenes that show strains on these two characters&apos; marital status and then out of nowhere,...it stops. They get into an argument and Gene temporarily leaves Dana but the issue is never resolved. So why have it? It doesn&apos;t make sense to start something and not finish it. Adam Kennedy and Eric Hughes wrote the screenplay; so my question is, who skimmed over this part? Also some people may think the story drags but it all builds up to good ending.\n\nBesides this, there are multiple things to find enjoyable in this movie. First, the special effects. Of course it&apos;s &quot;1980&quot; special effects but none the less they are a sight to look at. From the submarines, to the Titanic itself, the props look really authentic. It&apos;s when the Titanic is brought to the surface that the view is beautiful. Although audiences may be annoyed to find out that the Titanic is in one piece. But what do you expect? The novel and this film where produced years before the Titanic was even discovered. It&apos;s fiction anyway, so why be so critical on accuracy when practically this whole film is inaccurate in real life?\n\nOne of the most wondrous moments that takes place in this film is when Dirk Pitt enters the Titanic when it is above the water. It is truly a sight to behold and all this should do is make each of us just a little hungrier to see the Titanic for ourselves. It&apos;s plain epic. Another great aspect to Raise the Titanic is the soundtrack composed and conducted by music veteran John Barry. Barry puts in a lot of good tunes and has a gift for making the Titanic look awesome just for being on screen. His music is that moving and it&apos;s almost to the point of being angelic. For those who are skeptical, it&apos;s still at least worth a try to view.\n\nExcept for a few issues dealing with the script, the film adaptation of Raise the Titanic is respectively a suitable tribute to the White Star Line cruise ship. The effects are dated but they are worthy to be seen as is Barry&apos;s score heard.",

The joy in their lifes are their children, and Pernilla and Stellan manage to create a memorable portrait of two poor but happy parents.\n\nIn a lonesome castle lives the Emperor, excellently played by Thommy Berggren, and his wife. He is a somewhat tragicomical character, small and insignificant and completely misplaced as an emperor. His innermost desire is to be loved and respected, but his wife, referred to only as the Empress, despises him and suffers from constant headaches for which she blames him. The Emperor is a truly beautifully crafted character, and as he wanders down his enourmous hallways you can not resist to feel sorry for him.\n\nOne day the Emperor decides to go for a ride in his horse-cart. Albert´s two children acts as gate-openers for him, and receives some coins for the work. But the Emperor´s mind gets completely obsessed with the idea of having a pair of nice children in the castle...\n\nThe first minutes of this intricate and fascinating saga directly sets a mood that continues throughout the film. A sense of unreality, as in perhaps Ingmar Bergman´s Fanny och Alexander, and it is a mood that fits the movie perfectly. This is originally a tale written by Maria Gripe, one of Sweden´s best in the genre. Although i haven´t read the book, the film captures the essence of great storytelling, and the cast is superb. The film might be a bit scary for younger children to watch alone, so don´t resist to watch it with them."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Mad Monster&quot; is another of the low budget little horror movies turned out by poverty row studio PRC in the early 1940s. In spite of some of the comments that I&apos;ve read on this picture, I rather enjoyed it.\n\nBasically the plot involves mad scientist Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) experimenting on his dim-witted assistant Petro (Glenn Strange), turning him into a werewolf. It&apos;s the old story of a scientist trying to create a super race in order to build an invincible army and you guessed it, take over the world. At the same time Cameron seeks revenge on those who had publicly humiliated him when he first presented his ideas, by turning his mad monster upon them.\n\nDirector Sam Newfield gives us an entertaining little movie. In spite of its limited budget, it provides a creepy mist filled atmosphere, as the monster stalks its victims. It also aided by the casting of Zucco and Strange as the two principal characters. \n\nStrange plays Petro not unlike &quot;Lenny&quot; as played by Lon Chaney Jr. in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939). He also does a creditable job as the werewolf of the piece, again not unlike Chaney in the Universal series. Zucco was PRC&apos;s resident horror actor, a sort of a poor man&apos;s Karloff, and was always excellent in these roles. Strange usually played the Chaney like parts for PRC.\n\nThe standard hero Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) and heroine Lenora Cameron (Anna Nagle) round out the cast.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old B &amp; W &quot;B&quot; horror flicks of the 40s, then I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll like this one.",
