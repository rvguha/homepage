    "description": "There is no better place in Seattle to view the sunset than from the deck of our boat, sipping your favorite beverage while watching the sun go down!\n\nOn sunset cruises, Seattles sky often turns from a bright, sunny blue, to orange and violet, laced with red. Sailing back into the harbor, the entire waterfront is bathed in a warm, golden light and waterfront windows are ablaze with reflections of the sun.\n\nAs the sun sets and dusk settles in, the skyline of downtown Seattle lighting starts to twinkle, outlining the city and the space needle.

Being out in the water in South Lake Union is so nice - the views are incredible, particularly during sunset/at night.  But being out in the water in SLU in a hot tub boat? Next level.  The staff here are also so great, particularly Liam.  They went way out of their way to make our experience special - thank you!  Highly recommend this place!"

The boats are wood fire heated, so there’s a bonus campfire smell. Cruise right by Gasworks park and cute houseboats in a hot tub. Too cool.\n\nThe owner was really friendly and helpful. We were provided with a Bluetooth speaker, and waterproof holders for our phones. The changing room at the dock is very small, but there is a space to lock your belongings.\n\nHighly recommend! I’ll be doing this again!"

Our hot tub boat was simple to drive/use and had everything we needed, from waterproof phone cases, to a bluetooth speaker, to space for beers and snacks. There was a safe spot to stash our stuff on shore while we were out and a heater on in the changing room which was appreciated since it was a chilly night – it made the towels toasty when we returned. \n\nOur time on the boat was so chill and fun; we only saw a few other boats out and the skyline looked spectacular. I'm recommending this to everyone I know. it's such a unique, fun way to experience Seattle in a new way. Already planning to return in a few weeks!"

Then easy directions and instructions to what to expect and what to do. Once we parked we called and Rex answered right away and waved at us so we knew were to go. Rex was amazing and went over all they do to get ready for us. Our boat was ready!!!! They had cool dressing room and bam we were ready for our boat. Rex has the phone covers as advertised and a Bluetooth speaker. Once in the boat some very easy to understand directions and then off we went. Rex helps guide you out so it’s soooo simple. We spent 3 hours cruising the lake. This was money well spent and I would suggest that you do this. Thank you so much Rex."

Ha ha... The hot tub was spotless, the water was hot and stayed hot, while the smell of the fire made you feel like you were in a mountain cabin.  Now, add the novelty of sitting in a hot tub in Lake Union with the occasional sea plane landing, or taking off and you have the perfect conditions.  The owner was so incredibly accommodating, provided waterproof bags for phones and gear and also safe storage in the small building associated with the business.  The hot tub had two areas to place MANY beverages if desired.  We all made at least one polar plunge into Lake Union, which was SOOOO cold, but getting back into the hot tub was then a treat.  I'm not one who can usually tolerate a hot tub for long, but this was fantastic.  Highly, highly recommend...especially in winter conditions."

The smell of the wood burning fire put the whole experience over the top! Water proof phone cases, a Bluetooth speaker for music, water and towels were all provided! Come rain or shine, this is experience is worth every penny. One of the best things you can do in Seattle as a local or tourist."

I feel like the guide delt with the unruly guests well, maintaining professionalism. \nThere were some good stories, some good evps.  Interesting museum, but the guide had a photo on the wall of a well known haunted location in Iowa.\nHe misquoted the name of the town Villisca, calling it something else.  Which made us wonder."

Nice young man but he talked way too fast. \nSo fast, he would occasionally stutter or trip over his own words making him hard to understand.\nDon't know if he was in a hurry to get it over, as we were the last tour of the night, or he had consumed too much Seattle coffee.\nAnyway, the tour started at 7 p.m. Most of the ghost tours I have been on, take place near or after dark, kind of takes the \"scary\" part out of it with it being full daylight.\nHe mentioned the hotel I was staying in as being haunted, \" Room No. 209 Best Western Plus Pioneer Square\" and said there was talk about it on the internet although the hotel denies it.\nI could find nothing online that talked about room 209 of that building being haunted. (I was in room 217).\nAnyway, it just wasn't the best ghost tour I have been part of.\nWhat was interesting, I had a lenghty conversation with the guide about a paranormal experience I  have had  after it was over and he was not nearly as rushed in his speech.\nMaybe he gets nervous in front of crowds.\nI also thought we'd get to see more of the underground, but the only part we visited was within their own building."

We went on this tour in November and unfortunately it was freezing that night and raining and since it is a walking tour it is all outside. They take you around to different buildings where there have ghost either have been or are still living there, but you don't actually get to go in the buildings. We ended up leaving the tour to get hot chocolate lol. My daughter did get an interesting reading from the Tarot card reader that was there that night at the place you meet for the tour though, so that was really fun.  It might be better on a warmer evening and you are just wanting to hear the history.  We were with 21 year olds who wanted to be in the buildings and hoped to see ghosts."

The flow is extremely linear so only one puzzle can be completed at a time - this means only 1 or 2 people are participating. Other escape rooms allow concurrent puzzle solving, so everyone is involved.  The puzzles also required trial & error rather than problem solving to translate... Guessing shouldn't be a requirement.  I've done 10 other escape rooms around Seattle and would recommend any of those over this location."

We selected the 3-hour tour and hop on/off combo and were really happy with the experience. The hop on/off is about an 80 minute loop that stops just about anywhere you'd want to visit.   We grabbed coffee at Pike Place then caught the bus there. (Stat focused and be prepared to duck to avoid tree branches if you sit up top!)\nWe then took the 2:00 tour and it was better than we'd expected!  Our guide was knowledgeable and some of the stops were unexpected and really fun.   So much to see beyond what the hop on/off bus visits."

    "description": "This hike strikes a balance of being accessible to most with a base fitness level and challenging and short enough to never get boring. We initiate all of our experiences with a mindfulness practice to leave behind the hustle of daily life and invite you to be fully present in Nature. After enjoying a delicious picnic on the ledge, we'll descend as twilight turns to darkness. No worries though, this is a well maintained trail and we've got you covered with headlamps and flashlights. \n\nWe will meet in Seattle to ride together to the Rattlesnake Ledge trailhead. On the way we will pause to admire the region's largest and most impressive waterfalls, Snoqualmie Falls - a sacred place according to beliefs of the native Snoqualmie people.",

        "reviewBody": "We are big fans of hop on hop off tours but were terribly disappointed with our experience in Seattle.  We bought a combo ticket on line for a bus tour and harbor cruise.  We followed the directions to report to stop 1 to schedule our harbor cruise and found no one who knew what to do.  The attendant at the Kiosk was of no help.  The attendants at Stop 1 tried to call someone, but that was of no help.  We went to the Argosy boat tour provider and got no help there.  They referred us to the City Sightseeing Kiosk at Pier 55, which was closed.  In the end we had to buy our own tickets for the boat ride so we double paid.  The experience and frustration ruined what should have been a nice relaxing day.  Very sad.  Even sadder, I found an online customer link and emailed in my concerns.  I have not received a response and it has been five days."

Wendy selected excellent wineries for the tour, two of them taking fresh approaches to winemaking which I appreciated! She provides a fun experience and sincerely cares about the winemakers and their craft, imparting that to her clientele. The snacks in the van were perfect for the venue. I will definitely return to Yakima for more tastings, both wine and beer, and definitely recommend Little Hopper for you tasting experience."

If you are in Yakima and looking for a beer or wine tour, do not look any further because no one is better than Little Hoppers.  We met Wendy (the owner) and Julieann (our driver) during our trip to Yakima.  Wendy worked with us so we could have an outstanding wine tour.  She emailed us with tour details and included several recommendations for places to eat and things to do in Yakima.  Her recommendations were spot on!  She went out of her way to ensure our trip to Yakima was an enjoyable experience.  We truly enjoyed and appreciated the time we spent with her on our ride to/from the Hop’s Festival.  Julieann was more than just our driver during our wine tour.  She provided excellent information about the wines,  wineries, and the Yakima area.  More importantly, she was an absolute joy to hang out with.  We had fun conversations on the bus and when she checked in on us at the wineries.  All the wineries that were selected were excellent.  Wendy and Julieann are two of the nicest people you will ever meet and will ensure your Little Hopper experience is outstanding!  They are the Ambassadors of Yakima!  You will be missing out if you don’t book your tour with Little Hoppers.    "

We took my father who has been playing for over 10 years as a birthday gift. Its a great way to learn the origins & history of the sport.  Its also just a beautiful area.\nYou get a glimpse of the homes where the sport was born (its amazing to see how many folks have private courts in that area!). Playing at the Founders court was a real highlight! Madeline and Jen are knowledgable - plugged into the sport and the region, and fun! Also - Great lunch provided!"

From our seamless pick-up to the perfect timing of fun stops we made.\n\nThe day was magical as we ferried across the water and saw the beautiful mountains and Seattle skyline. We played pickleball trivia which was a great way to provide more pickleball history.\n\nThe Founder's local pickleball courts were so nice to play on and I loved the ambiance of all of the people there to play and enjoy each other's company. It was just the right amount of time, at each stop, to fit everything in. \n\nThe yummy lunch stop was awesome as was time to browse through the local farm and garden store, which was much more, with all kinds of fun items to peruse. The island museum and pickleball gift shop all added to this amazing experience.\n\nI would define the day as FUN, SUSPENSFUL AND EXCITING!  There was not a moment of time I wasn't enjoying this field trip! \n\nThank you for this over the top pickleball experience!"
