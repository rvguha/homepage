Most recently I rode the CAMBA trails (Northern WI) in hot humid July weather and could only ride without gloves for a short period of time before my sweaty hands were starting to slip. Once I put my gloves on it was time to get rowdy and send it again. If you ride without gloves consistently you may want to check out the factory version. These are good for me since it doesn&apos;t stay hot and humid for long here and I generally wear light gloves most of the riding season.",

He has the previous version of the Endura Windchill Jacket that fits perfectly in Men&apos;s Large and was his favorite jacket for many years.  This model jacket is so tiny it appears to be for a child.  The material does not stretch and he was not able to get his arm through the sleeve.  I am a woman&apos;s medium and was able to put it over my arms but could not zip it.  Something is seriously wrong with the sizing of this jacket.  Now I have to pay to ship it back.  Not happy that my husband does not have a present.",

        "reviewBody": "I’m 5’11” and weigh 182 lbs. I ordered the. l and L and could’ve gone with either.  I kept the XL which is very slightly large but still fits nicely with a long sleeve summer jersey underneath. It fits better with a thicker fall/winter long sleeve base layer.  The L would’ve been slightly restrictive as I have larger arms (not pencil cyclist arms and not body builder arms, just average) The build quality, material and attention to detail is superior to many manufacturers and on par IMO to ASSOS, Rapha etc. at a fraction of the cost.  My only knock is the color schemes or aesthetics. Not the best designs out there.  I use this jacket for road riding and actually the high vis yellow and grey isn’t a bad looking jacket at all.  Important to me is to be undeniably visible to motorist and the yellow is definitely high visibility",

In temps at 20 degrees F this is the outer shell of three layers and keeps everything warm, provides a nice fit, and allows enough movement for road riding. It is tight, but not uncomfortably so. It does really well at keeping the wind at bay and the core warm, which is really the toughest part of the ride. It&apos;s a keeper.",

However, this iteration of the Monteaux Kids down coat is thin and is missing some of the warmth. I’m not sure what the makers were attempting to achieve, but it isn’t 100% to our liking as other purchases have been. The next time we need a coat for our kids, we may look to other brands to open our options toward better quality.",

The Pro Mechanic HD works great—is much beefier and sturdier, and supports the bike with great stability. All parts are high quality and work well. The clamp is excellent— solid, strong, easy to clamp and to release. For its size and strength  it is lightweight and easy to move around. Expensive but you get what you pay for. Doubt I’ll ever need another repair stand.",

Replacement was simple, b-limit adjustment wasn&apos;t hard after finding the correct spacing on Sram&apos;s spec sheet. Shifting is precise, especially with Shimano&apos;s SP41 and replacement of the rest of the drivetrain components at the same time. I am using an X01 cassette, chain,  and a Wolf Tooth elliptical 30T chainring. Has not caused me any issues yet, so I am happy with the performance. My only wish is for the older 11-speed design to be reduced in price, seeing that the industry has shifted to 12-speed.",

I bought several pouches for my husband to keep in his get home bag in his semi. I think they’ll be fine if he ever needs them.",

When the pump works.. it works great. But, it can be difficult to attach if you&apos;re in a hurry or your valve is a little grimy. Once it is attached, there is always this first pump where the gauge goes way up, then it feels like a seal breaks and the air equalizes between tire and pump... I&apos;ve learned to live with that. \n\nWhat I can&apos;t live with is that if your valve cores are not tightened down with pliers, this pump with remove your core EVERY TIME. There is nothing more frustrating than when you think you&apos;re about to jump on the trail and then all the air comes rushing out of your tube or tire. The only reason I didn&apos;t throw this pump off a bridge out of anger is that I never lost a bead the few times this happened. \n\nIt&apos;s just a bad design on an expensive pump which is inexcusable. I don&apos;t know why I keep buying Lezyne products. They suck....  I think they make stuff for people who don&apos;t really ride bikes or work on them, and just think they are trendy.",

The size is perfect for a tube, cartridge, two tire levers, a multi tool, bacon strips, inflator, and derailleur hangar. Beyond that however, the zipper is difficult to open and even more difficult to close and the “water repellent” feature is far from “water proof.” The bag and all contents were soaked when I was caught in a heavy rain storm. I’m looking for another bag.",

Upon closer inspection, there is glue residue on the strap, toe looks like it was poorly glued on or even previously used. There are ends of the stitching sticking out everywhere. I’m sure the material shouldn’t be too bad for climbing but man am I disappointed with the build quality for not so cheap pair of climbing shoes. Hopefully it lasts at least a year of indoor climbing.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been climbing for some time and I am very very hard on shoes. I gym climb 3-4 times a week and tend to press against walls when sport climbing to get rests in between holds so I wear the big toe a lot. I say this because I have had these shoes for over a year, and in that time I have actually had 4 pairs and resoled two of them already. So I have really put this product through the wringer. I go through shoes way faster than most and tend to resole early to not wear out the rand. \n\nPros: if you are looking for an aggressive shoe with structure that is still comfortable, these should be a definite consideration. The semi split sole is great for some give in the shoe because is heel and toe box can flex independently. However, the thickness of the toe box rubber and the midsole provide you with a lot of support. The use of edge rubber is also a plus. All these things combined make it a good edging shoe because you have the structure beneath your foot to give you confidence. \n\nThey are down turned but not very asymmetrical. This means that your foot is not jammed in a shoe that concentrates all your power aggressively towards your big toe. I also have sportiva solution shoes and if you compare the two lasts, they are totally different. The lack of asymmetry means that you are in a more relaxed position when on your toe. This is good for longer sessions on the wall, and definitely mean a more comfortable fit. You can definitely wear these for a long time. It also means that people with slightly wider toe box needs can wear them. \n\nVelcro is good. Traditionalists love laces, and they are great for the shoes that have them, but for ease of on off, the two straps are great and allow for a good deal of adjustment. \n\nThey break in great. Stiff out of the box, but confirm well (but all good climbing shoes do this). The man made leather and full lining means these do not stretch that much, but like any shoe they do stretch a little. Snug initial fit is a good thing. Try them on and beat in mind that about a full  to half a size down is likely required. \n\nCons: be aware that the toe patch is basically non existent. These are more of a sport climbing shoe. If you are going to aggressively toe hook and boulders, may not be the best for long term use. The bits of rubber there are ok, and being fully lined they are comfortable to toe hook, but the shoe wasn’t made for that. \n\nAll man made leather gets stinky after a while. It’s just a fact. Deal with it. Real leather tends to deal better with stink. \n\nLike all shoes, if you beat the heck out of them, they will soften up. I feel as if these become better for feel as they get softer. My resoled shoes are really soft by this point. Really nice for technical moves, but the edging performance has gone down. Again, this is a normal thing for downturned shoes. If you want an edging shoe that will always be stiff, then you want a flat last hard rubber shoe made for that. It isn’t that these puppies  can’t edge, just that as they evolve, so does their edging performance \n\nSizing:\nI wear street shoe size 42. I have bought these in 41.5 (ended up being a bit too big) two pairs of 41 (just right for all day use) and a pair in 40.5 (Best for hardest sends). If I had to pick 1 all around size for me, I would go with the 41 (again street shoe size 42). \n\nI have resoled the 41.5 and a pair of the 41. (Rock and resole out of Colorado is an awesome place for resoles). They resole well and are like an old friend, but use a reputable place as I have had cobblers ruin some shoes before.\n\nThey are comfy, an amazing performer (a combo that isn’t easy to achieve) and they look good. If you are looking for an aggressive shoe that will help you progress, definitely a contender along with the Scarpa Instinct VS. you won’t regret spending the cash.",

A concept perfectly applicable to climbing: Otaki is a precise, supportive and structured climbing shoe, ideal for climbing in crags, on walls and boulders thanks to features that meet the requirements of today&apos;s modern climbers. The new construction method combines the advantages of the all round snug fit of a slipper to the precision and volume regulation of a Velcro closure shoe.  This solution guarantees maximum sensitivity and precision even in torsion: the shoe perfectly follows the movements of the climber eliminating empty volumes and rigid zones. The Innovative S-Heel? allows to maintain perfect torsion stability accentuating performance and adaptability in heel hooks when bouldering.",

Doesn&apos;t need that many crosses in the laces and is hard to adjust the fit. The only thing the TX3 needs is a couple of different color options.",

Great for terrain with rocks and slabs. It&apos;s been up the Grand Teton, and has logged lots of miles in the White Mountains. It&apos;s so comfortable I even wore it on non-rocky terrain up Kilimanjaro.\n\nOne poster mentioned that they get wet easily. True, but they are super-breathable and dry very fast. As always, there are trade-offs.\n\nLa Sportiva is discontinuing this shoe, but Backcountry still carries it. I just bought a spare pair for when my current one gives up the ghost.

At the same time, it is so comfortable I can hike all day in it without any problem. The mesh upper breaths really well, so my feet never get too hot. The sole is sticky and grabs on slabby rock better than my climbing shoes. This shoe is my default for hiking, backpacking, alpine climbing, and approaching on scree or rugged terrain, and I only switch to my mountaineering boots or climbing shoes when I absolutely have to. On more than one occasion I even rigged up my crampons to fit for a glacier climb and left the mountaineering boots behind.",

Tried them as a hiking/ multi-day backpacking shoe. \n\nFirst impressions: incredibly well made, comfortable upper, nice lacing system, amazing sole and traction.\n\nWearing around the house, I started noticing some numbness in the ball of my foot. I think I maybe tied them a little tight, but not so much that the upper was putting pressure on the top of my feet. I wanted to test them out more to see if walking around might allow my feet to settle, so I got out separately for a walk and a 2 hour hike the next. On the walk, the numbness persisted, and they were less breathable on a hot day than I would have expected a mesh upper to be.\n\nOn the hike, I really noticed the narrow toe-box putting pressure on my little toe. I don&apos;t have abnormally wide feet, so this was a little disappointing, though maybe to be expected in an approach shoe. Anyway, that aren&apos;t going to work for me. But they are a really well constructed shoe, which I appreciate. They seem to work well for many others!",

No extra parts; straight forward. Loading our bikes couldn’t be easier and once loaded, they are secured in a rock solid mount that even gives me the confidence to travel off road. The receiver locking mechanism is genius and the tilt-down function is a life saver for when you need to access the rear hatch. If you are in the market for a bike mount, and this meets your specifications, buy in confidence.",

I went to put it on this week and it wiggled itself loose due to so much play in between the 2&quot; sleeve and the hitch. No matter how tight I screw it in, it comes lose in about 20 minutes of driving. I contacted Rockymounts customer service and they admitted that the sleeve is notorious for having too much play and that I should just purchase the replacement 2&quot; base. Really disappointed that I can&apos;t trust a $500 dollar rack to haul my bikes.",

The tilt lever is way more ergonomic compared to reaching between bikes to pull the Kuat lever. The cable lock is a separate piece vs the integrated Kuat solution but the Kuat locks are terrible and can be raked open in 2 seconds. Factor in the lower cost and the Rockymounts is a clear winner.",

I like that the hitch pin screw&apos;s in it makes the rack very stable. I&apos;d give it a 5 star if the provided locks were metal. The casing is plastic and seems like it would be super easy to break. They sell metal locks which I purchased on the Rockymounts website. The locks are only $2.00 more each then the plastic locks. I wish they would raise the price $10 and provide the metal locks instead of the cheap plastic ones. If you buy one of these racks which I do recommend plan on buying 2 more metal locks at $20 a piece.",

So far I haven&apos;t scraped it on anything, and am happy with the high positioning of the bikes. The lock mechanism is a little finicky, but seems as secure as what the other brands offer.

The handles, and strap hardware still look like new. I like the fact that the bag seems molded in structure.  I go from work to the gym with this bag.  I am able to carry gym clothes, street clothes, toiletries, ipad, power cords, etc, with no problem.  An open main compartment allows for easy organization and access. The blue lining is great for visibility of contents.  The front pocket is very useful for smaller items. I can easily carry my shoes and water bottle in the side pockets. Despite the heavy contents of the bag, the bag is comfortable to carry using either shoulder strap or handles.",

The design is nice looking but the buckle is too tight so the belt just degrades immediately.

My only gripe is I had to melt and crimp the tip of the belt since it frayed after only two wearings. Other than that the belt is very good. I like it and would purchase another since there is a ?fix? if the belt starts to fray. For sizing perspective I wear a 32 waist jeans/pants and the belt has plenty of length without being too long in my opinion.",

        "reviewBody": "So far I really like the shoes after 200 miles, but there are a few changes I&apos;d like to see to make it a great shoe.  I plan on using these for both MTB and Gravel rides and races.\nWhen you put these on, they do feel really good.  Calling them Slippers might be a stretch but, the fit is close to the best out of the 15+ pairs of shoes I have owned in the past 30 years and probably the other 20 pairs I&apos;ve tried on.  My feet are long and pretty narrow, and my toes splay out.  I have a narrow heal, no bunnions, or anything weird like that, but my foot would be considered low-volume (ie. narrow vertically).  The Expedition has generous toe-box room, good mid-foot space and a nice supportive heal cup.  You can see some puckering on top of toe box due my low foot volume.  Compared to Shimano XC702 (reg) shoes, these are wider/roomier but the heel is just a tad looser.  I owned the original Specialized Recons (laces model) way back and found them too narrow in the front/toe box.  In fact, I believe that was the shoe that gave me Morton&apos;s Neuroma in my foot for 3 years:/. Not fun...  After having a Dr look at it and give cortisone injections, I switched to Lakes shoes (for Mtn, CX, and Road), and eventually the painful neuroma disappeared and I have had zero problems since.  I also have owned Shimano road and MTB shoes in the past and didn&apos;t seem to have problems with them, but they are narrower than Lakes I feel. \nDislikes: The Boa&apos;s work great and tighten the shoes very well, but the upper strap digs into front of my left ankle for some reason.  I feel the shoes tongue could be a tad longer and have relief cuts in it to help protect ankle a bit more.  Or.....move the Boa down 1/4&quot; so it pulls down more on the top of the foot rather than near the ankle?  I may need to modify (ie. cut) some relief into the strap the Boa is attached to.  It&apos;s easy to tighten Boa&apos;s too tight to secure shoes only to discover my feet going numb.  During every single ride so far, I had to stop, loosen all Boa&apos;s to prevent feet going numb.  This in turn can makes some heel movement felt if Boa&apos;s aren&apos;t quite tight enough.   Not the most walkable shoe due to stiff carbon soles and Boa feeling too close to ankle for me.\nLikes: \nShoes come with decent insoles.  Stiff carbon sole provides efficient pedaling.  Easy cleat positioning.  Nice grippy lugs.  Toe cap and heel protector look nice.  Shoe breathability seems to be plenty for me.   Shoes look good.  Love the color.  Sizing seems accurate.  I wear US12 and bought 47&apos;s.  Pretty lightweight as well.\nNeutral:  This shoe doesn&apos;t have toe spike capability.  So probably not using this shoe in muddy races.",

I love being able to pop the bottom boa to get some extra blood flow with some foot issues I have. It makes my rides longer for sure. \n\nOverall, so happy to have bought this shoe and will likely stick with it for a long time!",

        "reviewBody": "Before having these shoes, I’ve used top shoes from Specialized, Sidi, Shimano, Giro, etc. So I’ve seen my fair share of what top of the line shoes should feel like, and so seeing Pearl Izumi make a shoe that competes with a shoe like the Shimano S-Phyres, for a significantly lower price, I was instantly intrigued, and had to find out for myself if these shoes were really as good as Pearl Izumi made them out to be. \n\n\tStarting from the first ride, I was blown away. These are easily the most comfortable shoes that I’ve ever ridden, and they feel great straight out of the box, which I have never experienced before with any other shoe. I also love that the BOA system uses a different material for the straps, and it makes it easier to loosen and tighten the shoes without having to wrestle with a stiff cable. \n\n\tWhen comparing them to my Shimano S-Phyre shoes, I found that the weight difference was only by a couple grams, and both pairs were equally stiff in the sole, providing a very direct power transfer from my feet to the pedals. So to think that these shoes are in the same realm as Shimano’s top shoes, for a significantly lower price. It may seem like the quality of shoes your getting for the price your paying sounds too good to be true, but it is indeed true, and if you don’t believe me, try a pair for yourself!",

Stood up to a light morning rain. The vestibule design is nice for keeping shoes outside. The tent is very well ventilated, which is likely why we felt the cooler temps. Will be nice for summertime. The fine mesh keeps bugs outside. Overall a great tent!",

Here are the dimensions for the Trail Lite 3. H: 112cm W: 155 cm L: 224cm After a summer spent dying in an old winter tunnel tent, i am looking forward to spending this summer in the Trail Lite 3, i have not tried out outside, but i put it up to check it. And so far its the easiest tent i have ever put up. The materials feel like they are high quality and will stand the test of time. The only thing Im hesitant about is that there is no ventilation in the top of the rain cover. But i suppose you could open both of the doors slightly at the top under the lip, and get airflow through without it raining inside. Never thought i would be excited about a tent, but this one is so cool.",

        "reviewBody": "Short term review: we bought this for our sail boat as a freezer.  Lid comes off if you need an extra two inches to get it in some place.  We set to 0 degrees and it maintains well. Took a while to get down to temp and it helps to keep it full to maintain, ours only varies +3..  So quiet! Wish there was a led to know it is on.  The 50 is tons of room.  We can freeze enough to get 2-3 week extension on our sailing.  Sturdy and the cover is nice.  It really does help also.  Latches are good.  Very little cooling leakage we tested with a thermal scope. Less than our drawer refrigerators.  Flexibility on power was a must for us as our boat was 220ac  and 12 volt dc. Other good units are not as flexible. Power draw seems on par our better than any unit out there with this capability.   Our only concern is longevity as compared to the other units out there that have decades of life.  nothing gives us pause right now, it’s just the one remaining thing I can’t vouch for yet.",

I ran it with the Yeti 1400 for several days and the Yeti still had plenty of power left.  I plugged my 200x into when it was already chilled down and after 12 hours the 200x still 29% of its power left.  I never could get the Bluetooth goal zero app to display the internal temperature of the Alta.  I was able to use the app to change setting, but internal temperature was always wrong.  This unit will be part of our overlanding system.  Goal Zero just needs to work on that app.",

After a full day outside it did start to smell a small amount. I paid a sale price so my brain says it was a great deal, but if I paid full price it would have been typical quality for the price.\r\n\r\nMost US small men&apos;s clothing fits like a trash bag on me which is frustrating (x-small is rarely available). I was happy that this fit with a tad bit of room but could easily be layered over without bunching up much. I would have been happy if it were slightly smaller as well. I&apos;m 5&apos;10&quot; ~150 lbs with narrow shoulders.",

I&apos;m 6&apos;2&quot;  32&quot; waist -  the Large fits well  without being tight or saggy\n\nhood is perfect fit over ski helmet - light and flexible when I&apos;m not willing to mummy up into my heavier jacket shell hood.",

I received a jacket with the zipper pull tab on the left side. Since the zipper first appeared in North America the pull tab has been on the right side on jackets and everything else for men.  Left side for women.   The opposite is common in many parts of the world, especially in military surplus.   After a lifetime of the tab being on the right, it is very difficult to change, especially in an emergency, dark, freezing weather, etc. and more so for me who has limited use of sime fingers on the left hand,\nReturned the jacket for credit to my account.  Good customer service but I wish I had been able to get one with the zipper tab on the right.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought the TR1 Loop for a day  hike in the Aravaipa Canyon wilderness. I was looking for non waterproof hiking shoes , good in wet, sandy and rocky conditions. Roughly 30% of the hike was spent walking in the creek. Most of the time, water was just over the ankle, rarely up to half the calf. The rest of the hike was over sandy, sometimes rocky terrain. \nThanks to the TR1 Loop , I felt confident even on slippery surface, compared to my hiking companion, I never had to take off my shoes to remove the sand. The sole was thick enough not to feel the rocks. The water left the shoes very easily. \nOne thing to know, I used the TR1 for a day hike at the end of November. It took quite a while for the shoes to dry. If we had stayed in the canyon for the night with cold temperatures, I am not sure the shoes would have been dry the next day. Not really an issue since they will get wet again but still never a good feeling to put on wet shoes in the morning when it&apos;s cold, you just need a thick pair of wool socks.\nFor the sizing, I am a women 7.5, usually for hiking shoes, I always bought a half size to a size bigger. For these shoes, I just bought my regular size and was able to put thick socks. I was afraid to &quot;loose&quot; my shoes and for me it was the right choice.",

They&apos;re well-draining and quick drying, which is essential for foot health when you&apos;re walking through creeks and rivers several times per day. \n\nIn addition to all that, they&apos;re so comfortable that I can wear them bare foot without experiencing any rubbing or pressure points. The wide toe box allows my foot to keep it&apos;s natural shape so that I can wear these shoes from dawn to dusk and my feet stay happy. 10/10 would recommend these!",

Cons: super smelly after only a couple of months and the toe cap is already separating! I bought these after Merrell discontinued their Hydrotrekker shoe (which never ever smelled despite months of using them to wade in rivers). All that said, I am really hard on stuff and mainly disappointed because these were advertised as having special anti-odor tech.",

Not too bad, but I went ahead and ordered a 7 to see if it would fit better.  There was too much room in the toe box so I was afraid of slippage on my heel.  I really like the way wide toe box on these shoes so I was really torn on what to do being I couldnt get a 6.5. I finally tried the 7 with winter socks and that was better.  I decided to get the 7 for winter walking.  Im still upset about not being able to get my size.  Ive never been confronted with not being able to get a 1/2 size.  Who does that anyway?  Not good.I would recommend this shoe if I could have gotten my size.",

In addition, the sleeves and the back are some weird, unnatural fabric that appears to be &quot;flocked&quot; with wool on the interior side of the fabric.  This weird fabric is not nearly as flexible as wool and thus the entire jacket is not very comfortable for sports.  And isn&apos;t that the purpose of this jacket?  The length of the jacket is not really adequate if you&apos;re over say 5&apos;4&quot;.  It will ride up when active or sitting down and will expose the wearer to cold.  This WAS my favorite jacket!  Please SmartWool, rethink.  I&apos;d stock up on multiple colors annually...",

I love the vibrant color options—it adds a pop of personality to any outfit.

The boots compartment is perfect for my steel toes, hard hat, and other PPE because it’s sealed off from everything else. Plenty of room for a week’s worth of field clothes and after-work slouch clothes. And the 85-L is just the right size for packing a full bag and not exceeding the standard 50-lb weight limit for most commercial airlines. Plus it’s beautiful and has all the straps in all the right places for lifting and moving. Just bought a second for my partner!",

        "reviewBody": "Very happy with performance.  Used for two week Europe trip, took trains, bus and ferry from Amsterdam to Milan and six different hotels. Lots of unpacking and repacking and walking to and from train stations including cobble stone streets. Handle adjusts to 2 lengths. Multiple grab points on bag and the two compression straps let you reduce bag size and are attached to bottom of bag so not just depending on the zipper. Multiple compartments combined with packing cubes made organizing easy.  Hard shell bottom made bag easy to pack and no worries about it sagging to the pavement.  Very happy with my purchase.  Note, as bag opens up from the middle and has compartments accessed from the inside it can’t be used as a single compartment bag for very large items.  For me bag size was just right, not too big not too small.\r\nI plan to use the bag for hunting trips up north in Michigan and think it will also work well for that (though I’ll still need an extra bag for rubber boots, waders and hunting boots).",

Medium fit exactly how I prefer (loose but not oversized) for my measurements (36&quot;-29&quot;-39&quot;). I love the deep front zip which provides for a bit more airflow when moving. Sleeves are long enough on me to pull over my hands for sun protection, but the elastic is tight enough to keep them up at the wrists as well. The hood is generous and stays put over a baseball hat. The looser fit provides better mosquito protection than tighter UPF shirt options. Planning to take this shirt on lots of work and personal adventures.",

So I bought these tips which have the aforementioned locking slot to replace mine but can’t get the tips off despite multiple attempts with submersion in boiling water &amp; pliers. Just wish the poles came with it in the first place!!",

Pretty sure my Distance Carbon Z poles won&apos;t last another 8+ years but at least they&apos;ll die with renewed tips :)",

I ordered the folded Rubino Pro tires for the light tread pattern. We find the light tread pattern on the edges offers a more secure grip on the mixed surfaces of our routes. Interestingly, the .030 inch step on the mold-line is the deepest feature on the tire. The fit around the rim was firm and we like it.",

Riding this one I ran over something and then the noise or air and fluid escaping. This time a small hash in the sidewall that again the sealant would not seal. Both occasions needed a tube to get home. I guess if you ride pristine roads they are fine but for the debris potholed things we call roads here in San Diego tougher tires with tubes are probably needed.",

The issue is apparently the two half&apos;s of the tire mold did not align accurately at the center line of the tire and were off set approximately 0.5 ~ 1.0 millimeters. This means that one side of the tire is higher or lower at 180 degree intervals, making the tire exhibit eccentric motion (wobbly) at higher speeds. I&apos;ll be contacting Competitive Cyclist to see is there is a manufacture&apos;s warren-tee for defects. There are good tires over-all and I will continue utilize Rubinos on my bikes provided Vittoria gets their manufacturing quality corrected.",

I had 2+ oz of sealant in my tire.\n\nI pumped it up, filled up my sink with water, and immersed my wheel/tire in the water, only to see tiny air bubbles coming up from the sidewalls - all around the tire. Pulled the tire out of the water, and you could feel air coming out from the sidewalls. I don&apos;t know how this could happen apart from it being a manufacturing defect.\n\nThis is not my first time mounting tubeless tires, and I&apos;m returning these ASAP.",

I like these Vittorias better than the Giant Gavias that came with the bike, and better than the Hutchinson Sector 28s I mounted after I wore out the Giants.  Why?  1:  mounted easily without needing levers.  2:  Sealed quickly with a little boost from the compressor.  3:  Immediately held pressure overnight.  4:  Riding them feels fast and smooth.  One caution:  these tires run narrower than the labeled size.  25mm measured just under 23, so I returned them and ordered 28s, which measure about 27.  Only 150 miles so far, so I can&apos;t speak to durability.  I have the same question as Giorgio regarding pressure.  I find they work well at 65 - 70.  Can&apos;t seem to get an answer to why the manufacturers all  specify an unrealistically high minimum pressure.",

The problem is not with my body type, jackets from other outdoor brands fit just fine. Maybe Patagonia is sizing their womens&apos; clothes for a specific ethnicity, where the women perhaps have very, very, very narrow hips.  But women of *most* ethnicities do not have this body type. \r\nAlongwith the sustainability focus, I wish Patagonia could add inclusivity to its goals.",

The strip of elastic material around the collar was not a good idea though, because it&apos;s stiff and uncomfortable when rubbing against the neck. Also the wind flap inside the zipper is unnecessary and annoyingly bulky. Other than that it&apos;s very nice. It&apos;s definitely best used as a more casual piece due to its bulk.",

I wanted to capture the magic the Gaviota 5&apos;s made in my life when out on the golf course in me middle of winter (a mid-state California winter but still cold and wet). The Stinson 7 looks ro be the trail version of the Gaviota 5 but not waterproof. So I bought the Speedgoat with spikes just for the gtx lining. Low expectations but I was amazed. Even though they sound like studded snow tires on dry pavement they grip the ground as I track my golf ball hither and yon. The laces release from a &quot;heel lock lacing&quot; easier than the Gaviotas. I don&apos;t know if the spikes add anything to the Speedgoat&apos;s grip on wer grass and dirt, but they make my feet feel great after a round.",

I wish the original tongue was low profile, uncushioned, and flat, not an over-stuffed, high reaching tongue.  Merrell, do you even wear the shoes you make?",

Either Upper or tongue is way too narrow, as it is impossible to obtain full closure of the areas, permitting debris and liquid to enter.  Laces are insufficient in length to insure secure lock of my foot in the shoe.   Break-in was longer than anticipated, but this is not necessarily indicative of defective product as were my earlier three comments.  I have been wearing US size 9 Merrell products for the past 29 years.   Frankly it appears your firm has elected to sacrifice quality in production in favor of increased line items.",

I do wish those were a little longer or had some sort of lip to hold the peels in place during a slight breeze.\nOverall though it is a great little portable table for my Koda 16.",

I did place an ensolite pad beneath it for protection but perhaps i would have been more comfortable with the ensolite on top. it packs well without adding alot of weight and i like that it has a little cushion to it so even if it fails and air leaks i will still have some protection beneath me.",

After my first one was destroyed in a storm on a motorcycle trip to the badlands back in August. I knew I needed to replace before my backpacking trip near Aspen Co. After waiting too long to order a new one I decided to take my product right to your wear house in Boulder. Left the next morning and slept in a foot of snow above 11,oooft and could have not gotten a better nights sleep after a nine miles out. This product had no problem keeping air throughout the night and not once felt the cold ground underneath me. Ill be honest and did not have all the right gear for the conditions but I am would not have made it through the night without the model Ether Light XT Extreme Air Sleeping Pad!! Packing and unpacking was no issues even in below zero degree temps. I did not get a chance to use the pillow lock system but wish I had set it up because that was the only issue was my pillow moving. Totally my fault not the product and I look forward to installing the pillow lock system before the next use!!",

I have a pear shape and the size that fits my legs and butt, has a huge gap in the waist and a droopy crotch. I tried a size 8 and 10. Normally wear an 8. The 8 was a bit snug in the legs. 10 I could move around better. BUT neither was very flattering looking, and also not comfortable. I need a belt to keep them up, and then they still droop in the crotch and the material around the waist bunches. For the money and hype, this is super disappointing and I will be returning them. I reached out to their customer service asking which pants would be more suited for my body type, and they basically said, go with overalls or those joggers with the elastic waist....",

I loved the fit, all the pockets, and the insulation was just right with a thin base layer underneath. However, while wearing them on a snowy day, I quickly realized that the waterproofing was not even good enough to keep my behind dry on the lift, let alone if I had to sit down to strap on my board. On my second outing, I wore a Goretex layer underneath to keep the water from getting to me, but that ended up being ridiculously too warm. So, sadly, I returned them. If conditions are such that the weak waterproofing won&apos;t be an issue for you, go for this bib... I think you&apos;ll love it.",

My only complaint is that there is a TINY bit of restriction when I&apos;m in a squatting position. The bib almost rides up my crotch area but thank goodness for the ventilation zippers!!! The bib provides plenty of extra room for other layers. I can fit an oversized hoodie for the warmer days on the mountain.\n\nI will be taking these up to mammoth so we&apos;ll see how these hold up in the long run.

        "reviewBody": "Nice bag, haven&apos;t taken it out yet but it will get a full testing on multiple peaks this winter. Couple of things that were weird. The belt I got is not the belt in the picture. One of the reasons I liked this older model was that the belt is white which stands out against my black jacket and A) is easier to quickly access and B) looks nicer. The pockets on the belt I received are black which is clearly not what is demonstrated in the picture. There&apos;s a lot of additional black piping and some buckles that are black and again, not what&apos;s pictured.\n\nFit wise it seems ok but I am a little concerned to put actual weight in it due to how the shoulder straps lay. I can&apos;t seem to find a position for the chest strap where it&apos;s tight enough to do anything AND doesn&apos;t pull the shoulder straps off of my body on the outside edge. Being a female with boobs probably doesn&apos;t help but I&apos;ve never actually had this problem with a bag before so it&apos;s just odd. It seems like it will drive the inner edge of the shoulder straps into my chest which will end up being quite painful but I haven&apos;t tested it yet so not 100% sure.\n\nThe accessories like crampons loops, daisy chain, hook closure, pockets, zippers, etc all works as intended and seems well thought out.",

The belt should be bulk-free minimalist; and if anything have gear loops (… see the scramblers pack for hiking. No fanny pouches and gear loops). This midsize day pack would be better off with true top lid-pack rather than side pockets. I’m not a fan of the metal hook closure for the top. It can come undone too easily. The pack is no longer made of full spectra (now only 20% fibre). This is likely a cost saving measure. Enough complaining…. Living room loaded testing: the fit is excellent.",

It is holding up well to airplane travel and being tossed around at the crags however the big reason for three stars is the fit. I ama 5&apos;4, 120#, &apos;athletic build&apos; (aka- climber shoulders) female and the pack straps are just too wide for comfort. Regardless of how much weight is in the pack, it is extremely uncomfortable and too wide in the shoulder unless I have the chest strap buckled to suck the straps in. A bit disappointing since I poured over reviews before buying. Hopefully this saves some smaller folks the trouble and shame on me for not trying on packs before buying!",

Not so many features that it&apos;s overwhelming, but all the features I want. I find it to be comfortable on long days and with a heavy load. You can really fit a lot inside and all the bits you want on the outside have good attachment points.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism is that care must be taken when storing ice tools (There&apos;s no worry when storing a normal ice axe, only water-ice tools). It looks like they might have changed this since I bought it, but the fabric used on my version (grey at the bottom) was easily ripped by the tools and more easily punctured. This doesn&apos;t happen when storing crampons on the front --- I really wrench those down and the material appears to be bomb proof. I feel like I will be (mostly) more careful stowing my ice tools now, but I have shortened the life of my pack a little, which is too bad because I like it so much.",
