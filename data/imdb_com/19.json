As much as these people who comment about the movie say its cliché and crap.. well i disagree. I think it was written excellently, the characters actually in depth and not total crack heads... for a movie surrounding an illegal substance, i think it was really great. there are moments where your like &apos;wtf is going on&apos; but you can&apos;t help but laugh mainly because it&apos;s just so far out there. i liked the originality, and the timing like a previous commenter said nothing lasted longer then it should have. i think it was directed greatly and anyone who honestly thinks a movie to be cliché, either is too harsh, or doesn&apos;t know what goes into a movie to begin with. coming up with originality and intrigue is hard to do and i think Wennekers and Moyle both did a great job. :)",

      "reviewBody": "Bitter Tea is one of my favourite Capra films, the earliest one I would call that &quot;much over-worked phrase&quot;, a classic. I don&apos;t know if the original story was much different, but even being pre-Code this film would be shot much differently nowadays - unfortunately, of course! It appears to be just as hung up about love between the races as any other Golden Age movie was, except the tale&apos;s conclusion is more open to interpretation and franker in its portrayal. But even that was spoiled by Walter Connolly&apos;s Jerry Springer type moral ramblings at the end as solace for any outraged whites.\n\nIt&apos;s a murky, atmospheric, lustrous (in the romantic arc-light), absorbing 83 minute journey through a rather horrible world, populated by semi human beings - naturally Western wars are so much more civilised affairs. Throughout Stanwyck does her best and looks her best too, no wonder Gen Yen fell for her! I hope modern Scandanavians don&apos;t feel too humiliated by Nils Asther playing a Chinaman though (&amp; v.v.) As a non practising Christian I didn&apos;t take offence at the criticism levelled at Christianity&apos;s manifold moral ambiguities - but enough of all that!\n\nA wonderful film to sink into every few years not only for the story but also the gleaming photography, the visual composition of the scene near the end where Yen is brewing the tea of the title is so achingly beautiful that it brings the tears to my eyes as I think about it! But remember it was made in 1932 so if you don&apos;t like shiny charming creakers it&apos;s probably not your cup of tea.",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s face it Eddy Murphy hasn&apos;t been making grade A movies over the past few years, at least none that matched his earlier films. So I can&apos;t help but admit that I was a little skeptical when I saw A Thousand Words advertised on T.V. To my surprise however, I was actually entertained with this picture, and even more surprised by the serious message present in this film. So sit back, relax, and read more about Eddy Murphy&apos;s newest film A Thousand Words.\n\nThe movie basically starts out like any other movie he stars in with Eddy Murphy, playing Jack McCall, being involved in some busy career and the rest of his life is essentially put on hold. As usual, these opening scenes are filled with his classic crude humor, some of which was funny for me and some I had heard countless times before. Murphy&apos;s mouth is as filthy as ever, and those who love hearing him scream and curse will not be disappointed at the majority of his dialog at the beginning of the movie. However, things change when the guru Sinja (Cliff Curtis) is visited by McCall and the blood bond between a magical tree and McCall get his thousand word limit, where every word he speaks (and writes) results in a leaf falling off the tree. From this point onward, the comedy style takes a different path and involves a combination of funny dialog, situational comedy, and of course some funny gestures that made me chuckle. With a limited number of words at his disposable, the writers did a nice job picking the right words at the right moment. There were countless times I laughed as he said one or two words at just the right moment to have me laughing. Instead of Murphy saying most of the funny lines though, his apprentice Aaron (Clark Duke) provided most of the zingers. Duke manages to once again play the naïve, immature teenager who knows how to say the wrong things, at the wrong time, in the most awkward way possible. As a result it works, though it does get annoying after the fifth or sixth time. What was funnier for me however, were the comedic situations Murphy&apos;s character was forced to endure. A few charade scenes, the escort of a blind man, and countless business meetings that required him to speak made me crack up at various points in the movie. \n\nHowever, comedy is not the only thing this movie has to offer. A Thousand Words has a message built into it that really hit me deep down. Now revealing this message would ruin a lot of things about this movie, so I can&apos;t tell you what it is. The way they presented the message is free game though, and quite well done. I applaud the director&apos;s brilliant technique of building up the tension in the movie using temporary lulls in the comedy to develop the situation. When the limit is reached however, the group manages to capture the emotions with a combination of fitting music, great camera angles, and just the right balance of screen time to capture the actor&apos;s emotion. Murphy surprised me with how serious a role he can play and I admit there were one or two times I nearly teared up. Yes there were points where this movie was a little preachy and cheesy, but overall it tugged at my heart strings and made me really appreciate what they had to say. However, it&apos;s up to you to see the movie and see if the message affects you the same way. \n\nOverall, A Thousand Words is a decent comedy, not the best or the crudest mind you, but still decent. The nice balance of drama and comedy, on top of some good character development and clever use of props and the environment were very entertaining for me. Yes, it&apos;s the same predictable Eddie Murphy movie you have seen in the past, but it&apos;s finally getting back to his comedic roots, while still providing some dynamic emotion that I haven&apos;t seen him do in a while. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Well for comedy not really, you can get the fun laughs just as well at home. However, the strong spiritual message this movie offers I think is worth a trip, but that&apos;s just me. Regardless here are the scores:\n\nComedy: 6.0 Movie Overall: 7.0\n\nSo as always enjoy the movies my friends and tune in next week for a review on 21 Jump Street.",

      "name": "A minor Murnau work, but remains essential viewing",
      "reviewBody": "As I&apos;ve discovered after relatively recent viewings of &apos;Nosferatu (1922),&apos; &apos;The Last Laugh (1924)&apos; and &apos;Faust (1926),&apos; F.W. Murnau was one of the most exciting and influential European directors working during the 1920s. His contributions towards early German cinema are rivalled only by Fritz Lang, and his ability to use lighting and shadows to create atmosphere are almost unparalleled. &apos;Herr Tartüff / Tartuffe (1926)&apos; was apparently forced upon Murnau by contractual obligations with Universum Film (UFA), and you suspect that perhaps his heart wasn&apos;t quite in it, but the end result nonetheless remains essential viewing, as are all the director&apos;s films. The story is based upon Molière&apos;s successful 1664 play, &quot;Tartuffe,&quot; which explored the notion of hypocrisy, particularly among self-proclaimed religious &quot;devotees.&quot; Murnau and screenwriter Carl Mayer stripped the story to its bare essentials, removing any extraneous supporting characters and creating a close-knit triangle  Herr Orgon, Frau Elmire and Tartüff  around which the story revolves. Murnau also added an interesting framing device, whereby the story of Tartuffe becomes a film-within-a-film that a young actor shows to his grandfather to warn of his housekeeper&apos;s evil intentions.\n\nInterestingly, I found the story&apos;s prologue  of the old man and his scheming housekeeper  to be a more engrossing story than the film that the characters are later shown. The conniving old woman (Rosa Valetti), with a devilish grin like a Cheshire Cat, manages to convince her senile employer (Hermann Picha) that his grandson has dishonoured the family name by becoming an actor, and so she sets herself up to inherit his entire fortune. When the sincere young actor (André Mattoni) finds out about this betrayal, he plans an ingenious stratagem to outwit the malicious housekeeper and convince his grandfather of her evil. Murnau was obviously a great believer in the power of cinema, and so it&apos;s no surprise that the young man chooses the cinematic medium with which to reveal the ultimate truth about hypocrites. The film, by employing a few deceptively simple shots, immediately translates the inner motivations driving each character: the housekeeper, greedy and malevolent, kicks aside her master&apos;s slippers, whereas the kind, loving grandson delicately sets them back into place. Also notable is a moment during the narrative when the young actor turns to the camera and addresses the audience directly, one of the earliest instances I&apos;ve seen of a character &quot;breaking the fourth wall.&quot;\n\nThe tale of Tartuffe himself is also worth watching for its technical accomplishments, even if the story itself seems somewhat generic and uninteresting. Most astounding is Murnau&apos;s exceptional use of lighting {assisted, of course, by cinematographer Karl Freund}, and, in many cases, entire rooms are seemingly being illuminated only by candlelight. This story concerns a happily-married woman, Frau Elmire (Lil Dagover), who is distraught to discover that her beloved husband, Herr Orgon (Werner Krauss), has become obsessed with Tartüff (the great Emil Jannings), a grotesque little man who speaks with divine importance and claims to be a Saint. However hard she tries, Elmire cannot convince Orgon that he has been duped by a religious fraud, so great is the cunning of Tartüffe&apos;s deception. In the film, Jannings predictably gives the finest performance, playing the unsavoury title character with a mixture of sly arrogance and lustful repugnance. Nevertheless, the role falls far short of the silent actor&apos;s greatest performances, which include Mephisto of &apos;Faust (1926)&apos; and the hotel porter from &apos;The Last Laugh (1924).&apos;",

      "reviewBody": "From the director who brought us Mad Max comes a modern-day fairy tale of sorts that examines the age-old battle of the sexes. Alex (Cher), Jane (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three single women who live in the sleepy New England town of Eastwick. Since all of them lack a man in their lives, and are dissatisfied with the ones who are in town, they wish for a handsome stranger to visit. Miraculously, their wish is granted when Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) strolls into town and succeeds in turning their lives (and the town&apos;s) upside down. For the most part, I thought that the story was very effective in setting up its characters and giving them depth, even Daryl. The three women who are the titular &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; were all distinct personalities and had situations that made you care about them. Generally speaking, the performances were all very good, although Jack Nicholson towers above the rest of the cast as he brings his brand of insanity to what is essentially the devil in human form. Even the whole &quot;witch&quot; thing was dealt with rather subtly, as the women only become witches by finding the power within themselves. It is this struggle between male and female power which forms the core conflict of the film, and it is a compelling one even though it has been many times over in various forms. The townspeople are also given some development, although probably not enough to warrant the attention provided them. There are references made to the Salem witch trials, and the wife of the town&apos;s newspaper editor (Richard Jenkins...with hair!) acts as the mouthpiece for morality when the the three &quot;witches&quot; start their relationship with Daryl. Despite this interesting aside, I think it detracts a little bit from the main conflict. Moving on, I also thought that John Williams&apos; score was fantastic and had this magical/mysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It&apos;s not his best score, but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also well-done, especially considering this was made in 1987. Overall, I thought this was a very entertaining and funny movie that presented a well-worn theme in a fresh way. The only detraction, I think, is that there&apos;s a bit of a mean streak in regards to the portrayal of the male characters which might turn that half of the audience off. Still, this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller&apos;s versatility and the acting talents of its cast.",

Today the film is very stiff and stagy but still holds it&apos;s own atmosphere of lust and feelings in the old castle. Gull-Maj Norin and Bodil Kjer are quiet international in their performances - Norin looks fantastic and Kjer is way above the material. The other actors are all very good and it is clear that Ipsen had a great talent as a director of actors. She should know since she worked as one for over 50 years! The film is very rare and is not available on DVD.",

His talent for unusual color combinations and prints is nicely manifested on the runway.\n\nNot too much pandering here to celebrity, though we do see some hangers-on in Mizrahi&apos;s daily life, his angst and ideas for a scrim (even imitated just this last week on a &quot;Tyra Banks&quot; show for Fashion Week) While I don&apos;t buy into all the hype and refuse to blindly follow fashion magazine trends, the models are lovely to watch, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Veronica Webb and a few others.\n\nCould now have a wider audience, &quot;Unzipped&quot; is far less shallow than more recent comparable documentaries on the fashion industry. 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "There are some films that are entertaining, thought-provoking and well-made. There are some that try to attain these qualities but fail. And then there are films like this. Technically, this film should be awful. The acting is poor, the storyline totally throwaway and there is more gratuitous nudity than... well, anything else in this movie. It&apos;s about as politically incorrect as you can get. But on the other hand, it&apos;s unpretentious. It&apos;s as if Russ Meyer said, &quot;Okay, let&apos;s get this straight. This is a sex comedy, now let&apos;s get down to the sex and comedy.&quot;\n\nOnce you&apos;ve got over the fact that this is a Dumb Movie And Proud Of It, this is a funny film. There are some sophisticated bits of satire- the very matter-of-fact narrator who links what is basically a series of sex scenes is reminiscent of those very moral public information films. There are also some jokes that are just plain stupid (the gay marriage counsellor is funny, if stereotypical).\n\nOf course, what Russ Meyer films are most famous for is naked busty women. Although I must admit that although the aim of the movie is clearly tittilation, after a while the nudity frankly becomes boring. We basically know that every woman who appears will get &apos;em out, whether for a sex scene, to sunbathe or, what the hey, just because she&apos;s a woman with large breasts. There&apos;s only so much you can take before it gets tedious.\n\nOtherwise, the movie is pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a Russ Meyer movie of this era. Lots of desert locations, the same actors and actresses that appear in all of them, some truly perverse sex scenes (necrophilia, incest, paedophilia and the list goes on) and a sex scene involving someone babbling on in a foreign language.\n\nBroadly speaking, you&apos;ll like this if you like Russ Meyer films. If not, you&apos;ll be bewildered and confused."

      "reviewBody": "In this haunting work by Vittoria De Sica an aristocratic Italian-Jewish family, the Finzi-Continis, serve as a symbol of European civilization in the hands of the brown shirts on the eve of World War II.  Seeing it again after thirty years I find myself saddened almost as much by the story of a stillborn, unrequited love as I am by the horror of the cattle cars to come.\n\nDominique Sanda with her large, soft eyes is mesmerizing as the beautiful, enigmatic, but icy Micol Finzi-Contini.  Giorgio (Lino Capolicchio) is her childhood friend, a boy from a middle-class Jewish family, now grown up. He&apos;s in love with her, but her feelings for him are that of a sister.  He is confused by her warmth, and then as he tries to get close, her cool rejection. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t It has often been expressed metaphorically that Europe in the thirties was raped by fascism.  However in this extremely disturbing film, De Sica is saying that it wasn&apos;t a rape, that the aristocracy of Europe (here represented by the Finzi-Continis of Ferrara, and in particular by the young and beautiful Micol) was a willing, even an eager, participant in the bestial conjoining.\n\nThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis is far from perfect; some would say it is also far from De Sica&apos;s best work.  Certainly it comes after his prime.  The editing is a little too severe in places, while some of the scenes are too loosely focused.  Nonetheless this is an enormously powerful film that finds its climax in one of the most disturbing scenes in all of cinema.  There is little point in discussing this film without looking at this scene. Consequently, for those of you who have not seen the film and do not want to risk having it spoiled for you, you should stop reading now and come back afterwards.\n\nEverything in the movie works toward setting up the cabana scene.  We see the dog several times, hinting at a crude, animalistic side to Micol.  And there is the wall that separates the Finzi-Contini&apos;s garden of civilization from the brown shirts in the streets, a wall that also separates the rich from other people, particularly from the middle class who support the fascists (as we are told in the opening scene).  We see Micol leading Giorgio by the hand about the estate, but always when he tries to caress her, she pulls away.  Finally she explains to him why she doesn&apos;t love him. She says, &quot;lovers want to overwhelm each other...[but]...we are as alike as two drops of water...how could we overwhelm and want to tear each other...it would be like making love with a brother...&quot;  But hearing these words is not enough.  Giorgio goes to the wall one last time, sees a red bicycle there (red and black were the colors of the Nazi party) and knows that Micol is with someone else.  He climbs the wall and finds the dog outside the cabana so that he knows she is within.  In the opening scene she referred to the cabana with the German &quot;Hütte,&quot; adding that now &quot;we&apos;ll all have to learn German.&quot;  What he sees when he looks through the window fills him with a kind of stupefying horror, as it does us.   Not a word is spoken.  He sees her, he sees who she is with and what the circumstances are.  She sees him, turns on the light so that there can be no mistake and they stare wordlessly at one another.  She projects not shame, but a sense of &quot;This is who I am. I would say I&apos;m sorry, but it wouldn&apos;t change anything.  This is what I&apos;m drawn to.&quot;\n\nWhat is expressed in this essentially symbolic scene, acted out in sexual terms, is what happened to Europe.  Micol is at once the love he wanted so much, deflowered by an anonymous, but clearly fascist man, and she is also the aristocracy of Europe, polluted by fascism.\n\nI wonder if it is just a coincidence that the famous poem by Robert Browning, &quot;My Last Duchess,&quot; is also set in Ferrara.  In that poem the narrator reveals himself through the unfeeling brutality of his speech and actions to be, although an aristocrat, an incipient fascist.  I also wonder if De Sica is saying that the Jews in some sense contributed to the horror that befell them, and by extension, all of humanity.  We see this expressed in the person of Giorgio&apos;s father who continually insists that it&apos;s not that bad yet, as step by step they lose their status as citizens, a prelude to the dehumanization that is the precursor of genocide.  Certainly the closing scenes in which the Jews of Italy are seen to be compliant as they are led to the slaughter suggests as much.  I know that the central feeling expressed by Jews after the war and especially in Israel was simply, never again.  Nevertheless, there is a certain sense of the inevitable about this film that I find particularly disturbing.  Passivity in sexual terms, a &quot;giving in&quot; to one&apos;s nature is one thing.  A passivity in political terms is quite another, and yet it is part of the power of this film to show us how they are related in our psyches."

      "reviewBody": "Gamme People, The (1956) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nExtremely bizarre science-fiction film from Columbia has Paul Douglas and Leslie Phillips playing American and British journalists who accidentally wind up in a small European town, which seems to be ran by a strange scientist. After a slow start the journalist soon learn that the scientist is doing experiments with a gamma ray, which he&apos;s using to try and create geniuses. Of course, whenever the experiments fail he ends up with ghouls who will do all his evil deeds. I don&apos;t think anyone in their right mind would put THE GAMMA PEOPLE on any sort of &quot;Best of..&quot; list but you could possibly find it on several &quot;WTF&quot; lists. This is without question one of the strangest films to come from the 1950s because not only does it try to capture the horror/sci-fi genre but it also mixes in some very strange comedy as well as some political undertones. All of this stuff thrown into one screenplay just leaves the viewer scratching his head because it&apos;s impossible to really figure out what&apos;s going on or what the filmmakers were trying to do. The screenplay itself is a mess as it&apos;s all over the map and what&apos;s worse is the horrid bits of comedy that are thrown in. At times it almost seems like you&apos;re watching a spoof of a horror movie but then you get more ghoulish activity that reminds you that this is supposed to be a horror film. Speaking of ghouls, the monsters here are downright silly and it&apos;s doubtful the youngest viewers in the world would be remotely scared of them. Not for a single second are any of them scary and that silly walk they do makes one want to laugh more than anything else. With this strange blend of genres you&apos;re almost looking at a horrid movie but what saves it from the &quot;so bad it&apos;s horrible&quot; file are the strong performances and the fact that it&apos;s rather well-made. When I say well-made I do mean on a technical level because the direction holds the material about as well as one could hope and the cinematography is also quite nice. I&apos;m not sure how much they had to pay Douglas to appear in this film but he does a very good job in the lead and plays it straight throughout. Phillips is also very good in his role as is Eva Bartok who plays an assistant who finally gets some courage to fight back. THE GAMMA PEOPLE has pretty much been forgotten over the years but it&apos;s certainly an interesting little experiment. It certainly doesn&apos;t work but fans of the genre will want to check it out just to see how strange it actually is."

      "reviewBody": "Great biopic of boxer James &apos;Gentleman Jim&apos; Corbett. The movie covers his life from pre-boxing days up to his championship boxing match with John L. Sullivan. Errol Flynn has a field day with the part. He&apos;s immensely charming and does most of his own boxing in this. Ward Bond is great as Sullivan, one of his best roles outside of his John Ford films. Alexis Smith is fine as the love interest. Fun support from Alan Hale, Jack Carson, and William Frawley. As with most of the great old Hollywood biographical films, attention is paid more to telling an entertaining story than being historically accurate. That doesn&apos;t bother me but your tastes may vary. Nice Warner Bros. production with period sets and costumes. A fun, light movie well-directed by frequent Flynn collaborator Raoul Walsh.",

After all this years I started searching on the web, because nobody in America seems to have ever heard of this movie. So far I only found an old German dubbed copy, but I look forward to finally see the original version. I have seen many movies in my time, but Brancaleone seems to always come to my mind when I think of comedy and middle ages. The Monty Python can not reach this one."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a fan of the Saw series, and Hostel (not of Hostel 2). I enjoy these types of movies and I&apos;m only a tad ashamed. Call me a dumb, violence seeking goon but these movies are entertaining. \n\nWhat&apos;s this got to do with Captivity? Well, nothing really. I was drawn to this movie because I thought it was going to be another retelling of this sick sub-genre of horror that I do so love. I was sadly disappointed because this absolutely is not a &quot;torture porn&quot; movie. It would have been much more honest of the production company, After Dark Films, to say it was a thriller with slight torture porn inklings (very slight).\n\nMaybe, the folks at After Dark didn&apos;t actually see the movie. What I saw was psychological in nature and dealt much more with assaults on the mind of those captive than it did with actual assaults on the bodies of those captive. Yes, there is some blood and some nasty gore but nothing like Saw or Hostel or even Touristas. \n\nUnderstand that if you don&apos;t like Saw, Hostel etc., then this is a good choice for a horror/thriller to go see this weekend. \n\nNow that that&apos;s out of the way I&apos;ll just say: It&apos;s not a great movie but adequate. A solid B-movie endeavor. Fun, kind of stupid at times, pretty good acting by the luscious Elisha Cuthbert (for the guys-your girlfriends might get jealous) and the director, Roland Joffe (best known for The Mission, The Killing Fields), imbued the entire film with a look that worked very well to be creepy and ominous. It moves fairly quickly, lags a bit in the middle and ends with a slightly predictable twist but really you don&apos;t care at that point because, surprise, you&apos;ve been entertained. Well, at least I was even though my hunger for gore was only slightly abated. \n\nB-",

It sounds like an interesting movie, but if I cannot understand the dialog it is pointless to bother with it. I searched on Google, but did not find any subtitles. Does anyone know where I can find subtitles for Deham? As I try to post this I am told that the review requires at least ten lines of text so this is additional meaningless text to make the stupid website take my review. If I just write a little more trivia I can get the dumb web site to take it."

He combines drama, comedy and even a little bit fiction (people jumping out of movie screens into the real world). Its a great story involving a woman with marital problems played superbly by Mia Farrow. Here Farrow gives one of her best performances, much better than she was in a film i recently viewed called Shadows and Fog. Jeff Daniels is also good in his role as the movie character who comes into the real world, as well as the actor who plays that role. This is by far one of the most complex yet well written Woody Allen flicks. All the performances are good as well as the direction and writing, almost everything is perfect. A must-see for any Woody fan.10/10 #60 on my list of all-time favorite films",

      "reviewBody": "Yet another comedy western from Italy, and to be honest I spent quite a lot of the running time wondering if I&apos;d watched this particular story of two mismatched brothers after an inheritance before, or if it was just that the story was that similar to some other &apos;inheritance/brothers&apos; film I&apos;d watched in the past, before realising I had watched it before about two seconds before it ended. \n\nRichard Harrison plays Jessie (a blonde blur on my copy), a fanny rat leaving a trail of debts and carpet monkeys all over the West. Jessie wants to open the greatest brothel the West has ever seen, but he has no money, so enter Donald O&apos;Brian as Lester (a dark blur on my copy) – Jessie&apos;s half-brother who is a tee-total Mormon who wants to build a church who informs Jessie that they have both inherited some land from an Uncle. The rest of the film involves the brother&apos;s japes as they try to earn cash to fulfil their dreams.\n\nAnd what japes! Throughout the pixelated, blurry mess, you&apos;ll half- witness the brothers continually losing money because of Lester&apos;s trust in the local banks (who are continually robbed by a blur called Poker), forced to wash dishes by Chinese bar owner George Wang (a blur with a stereotypical Chinese accent), robbed at gunpoint by the psychotic vague outline of Luciano Rossi, and just plain trying to rip off each other. \n\nWhat saves all this virtual cataract experience is Richard Harrison&apos;s natural acting (much better here than in the more serious films he appears in) and Donald O&apos;Brian&apos;s usual over the top shenanigans. There&apos;s plenty of action thrown in amongst all the painful comedy displayed by these Westerns by this point but then again if I spend my time wondering if I&apos;ve seen a film before, then how memorable is it going to be to someone who couldn&apos;t give a crap?\n\nOh, and if you like the soundtrack it&apos;s your lucky day because it plays almost constantly throughout the film.",

Also the places the film shot was great. My grandfather lives in a similar village, and I used to go to there in summers in my early ages. I went to back again to my childhood when I was watching the movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very good manner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed the drama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, a great directing success for the new generation director, Çagan Irmak. So, this a &quot;must to see&quot; film I think, especially for the Turkish viewers (It includes so much domestic features). But international viewers can also get a real good taste of it, because main themes (such as family bonds, love of son) in the movie are humane things.",

      "reviewBody": "As a huge fan of the likes of Tarrantino, Fincher, and the Coen brothers, I&apos;m betting that the skewed nature of the comedy is not going to be for everyone, but if you like your movies heavy on the WTF quotient, this one&apos;s for you.\n\nI saw it at the Cardiff Film Festival last week, and the audience couldn&apos;t get enough of it. Really a fun &quot;laughing your arse off&quot; kind of a time. The twists, surprises, and laughs build and build to an ending which I won&apos;t give away but was not at all what I expected. Pegg and Schwimmer are a crack comedy duo, but the addition of Eve to the antics ups the ante nicely. It loses a star for taking a bit longer to get going than I would have liked, but I&apos;m not quite sure how I would have cracked that particular nut.\n\nAll in all, this film&apos;s got more energy sparking off it than anything that&apos;s come down the pipe in quite a while. Will be seeing it again this weekend with my mates. GO BIG NOTHING!",

      "reviewBody": "John Wayne&apos;s first starring role just blew me away.  Televised letterbox style on AMC,  I had to check and make sure I had the right date.  Sure enough, this 1930  film was made using a 55 mm wide-screen process.  Aside from that,  it features some of the grittiest, most realistic footage of the trek west I&apos;ve seen.  Wagons, men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope. Trees are chopped by burly men -- and burly women -- so the train can move another 10 feet.  The Indians are not the &quot;pretty boy&quot; city slickers who portrayed them later; they&apos;re the real deal.  A river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic, it has to be real (In fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence).  I could smell the wet canvas.  Each day is an agony.  The various sub-plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not.  I can&apos;t think of another title that can beat The Big Trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to Oregon.  Bravo.",

      "reviewBody": "In London, the Nigerian illegal immigrant and former doctor Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) works as cab driver along the day and in the front desk of a hotel managed by Juan &apos;Sneaky&apos; (Sergi López) in the graveyard shift. He shares a couch in the small flat of the Turkish illegal immigrant Senay (Audrey Tautou), who also works in the hotel as maiden. One night, the Londoner prostitute Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) asks Okwe to fix the toilet of room 510, where she &apos;works&apos;, and he finds a human heart obstructing it. Okwe&apos;s further investigation discloses an invisible world of traffic of human organs of illegal immigrants in London. This excellent movie has a great screenplay about the urban legend of traffic of organs of the socially excluded immigrants in London. Just as a comparison, in Brazil, thousands of children of the lower classes vanish every year. The urban legend tells that they were adopted overseas or were used in the illegal traffic of human organs, but these stories are only rumor in Internet. Therefore, this theme in an excellent script is very attractive. Stephen Frears is one of the greatest directors of the cinema history and his movies are synonym of quality. The great surprise for me was the international cast, leaded by the unknown Chiwetel Ejiofor, followed by the excellent Audrey &apos;Amélie Poulain&apos; Tautou and Sergi &apos;Harry&apos; López , and the also unknown Sophie Okonedo, all of them with excellent performances. &apos;Dirty Pretty Things&apos; is a highly recommended film. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Coisas Belas e Sujas&apos; (Pretty and Dirty Things&apos;)",

The story moves along nicely, and one event seems to flow naturally into another.\n\nMy guess is, if there had been an A-List Hollywood star on board, like, eg, Bruce Willis, this little film might have gotten quite a bit more recognition.  But the chemistry would have been completely different.\n\nBring a date and some popcorn, and enjoy.",

Was it to support the cherry popping jokes? There&apos;s no other reason for fruit comedy in Race 2!! The only plus point that can be salvaged from Race 2 is its music.The music videos were interesting and helped to increase the movies tempo.\n\nOverall Race 2 is one of the worst movies I&apos;ve seen in 2013.Stay away from it.The music videos can be seen on Youtube for free.\n\nActing- 0/5 Story- 0/5 Direction- 0/5 Action- 1/5 Thriller- 1/5",

How do you make a boring &quot;documentary&quot; even more boring? Show a blank/black screen. Genius! That&apos;s sarcasm btw. If you really want a good documentary about Jane and her hippie lifestyle, watch F. T. A. Instead. At least they could actually fill an hour and a half with actual footage.",

      "reviewBody": "For a moment I thought I was really back in my teen-age 1957, the big-finned cars, the flouncy dresses, the sci-fi saturated drive-ins. Okay, I&apos;m nostalgic, but it really is a good flick, well acted, produced and written; plus, entertaining all the way through. So how will space-ranger Urp defeat the man-eating Ghota whose flying saucer has crashed into the North American desert. Good thing Urp borrows Dr. Lewis&apos;s body if not his hormones. At the same time, the village towns-people have to overcome their disbelief in alien space craft and shape-shifting monsters. What with all those vulnerable blonde cuties, I was really worried.\n\nThere are touches of satirical humor trading on 50&apos;s sci-fi, but the flick&apos;s too well rounded to qualify as just a spoof. In many ways, however, it does suggest a version of 1951&apos;s The Day The Earth Stood Still, from the latter&apos;s metal clad Gort to Klaatu&apos;s cosmic police force. However that may be, I was grabbed by that suburban house and its grassy yard sitting alone and in the middle of the immense desert, like a surrealist illusion. Actually, it&apos;s likely meant to show Lewis and wife&apos;s middle-class status among the town&apos;s backwoods types. And how about the parallel theatre scene with the panicked audience from 57&apos;s The Blob. It&apos;s an imaginative touch tying in with both AT&apos;s plot and the time period. Sure, the movie&apos;s gangly monsters are on the silly looking side, at least before they reduce you to goo. Still, it&apos;s an imaginative and well-done sci-fi, and a tribute to its 50&apos;s predecessors."

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with an outlaw by the name of &quot;Pat O&apos;Brien&quot; (George Montgomery) having fled across the Red River to Mexico for the murder of his wife. At least, that is what is rumored. To that effect, his status as an outlaw compels a bandit named &quot;Miguel Camargo&quot; (Jose Nieto) to befriend him and when Miguel accepts a high-ranking position within the Mexican army, he chooses Pat to look after his ranch while he is away commanding his informal cavalry. Not too far away from General Camargo&apos;s ranch is an impressive hacienda owned by a man named &quot;Don Cristobal Riano&quot; (Jesus Tordesillas) who has seen his wealth and influence disappear because of his support for Maximillian. He does, however, have a beautiful niece living with him by the name of &quot;Francisca Riano&quot; (Elisa Montes) and in order to cement closer ties with General Camargo has promised her hand in marriage to him. Unfortunately, his nephew &quot;Alfredo Riano&quot; (Ricardo Valle) has a deep hatred for both Pat O&apos;Brien and General Camargo and when he turns up dead the two of them are immediately suspected-and this creates problems for all concerned. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I honestly didn&apos;t expect much from this film due in large part to the rather low rating on IMDb. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the somewhat intricate plot and the solid acting of both George Montgomery and Jose Nieto. Likewise, having an attractive actress like Elisa Montes certainly didn&apos;t hurt either. In any case, although my opinion may be in the minority, I liked this particular film and I have rated it accordingly.",

      "reviewBody": "As an aspiring film maker, I see this as a personal achievement, but not a commercial achievement. I&apos;m going to break the film down and review every aspect of it. ACTING: For the most part, much of this movie plays like a soap opera. Some performances are decent and some are annoying as hell. Surprisingly to many, Dallas Page&apos;s performance was by the the most compelling and entertaining in the film. STORY: The story was decent as well. I will not reveal many details, but let me say that the scam was well thought out by the writer, and there were some unexpected twists, but in the end it seems like an extremely roundabout way to do a job. MUSIC: The music is exactly what you hear in the trailer. It is very techno-esquire sounding. No real instrumentals. But it doesn&apos;t detract much from the viewing experience. It suits the subject matter. PICTURE: It doesn&apos;t look bad, but it was filmed at 30p, meaning it looks more like video than film. This is forgivable, but it limits its commercial marketability. SOUND: This is BY FAR the WORST aspect of the film. There is no sound design, whatsoever. The sound is inconsistent from one shot from the next, with loud hisses and pops in one shot and then in the next shot, there is no hiss at all. The sound design really detracts from the viewing experience.\n\nOne upside to the sound design, for me as an aspiring film maker, is that it showed me how important sound design is in the final product.\n\nFINAL SUMMARY: This film is worth seeing for DDP fans and aspiring film makers. Aspiring film makers because this is a film shot on a 3.5 thousand dollar budget that received much acclaim, but still is not commercially marketable. Watch this film to see what it doesn&apos;t do well to improve your chances of making a commercially marketable film. Other than that, the film won&apos;t be worth much to the average viewer. However, I am a huge DDP fan, and his performance was so bad ass and cool at times that I will no doubt revisit this film in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "Her Name is Sabine is a beautifully filmed and portrayed story of a young autistic woman by her devoted sister.\n\nI am a teacher who has worked with and researched individuals with ADD, ADHD, Asperger&apos;s syndrome and autism. They are emotionally beautiful, intelligent, and extremely sensitive individuals. We have much to learn and change within ourselves to be responsive to the true needs of these individuals.\n\nCNN recently posted many articles and videos online as they covered autism on World Autism Awareness Day. Autistics need and are governed within largely by love. One video showed how having a personal dog, trained to be with an autistic individual, gave that person a long time friend to love and with whom to interact. These dogs can sense the needs of the autistic person, providing an atmosphere of loving calmness and often helping to still the anxiousness before, during or after a stressful episode.\n\nHopefully an institution could provide or accept animals such as this in their program, or perhaps even a small animal could be loved and cared for. Love must flow, for if blocked, well being is gone, rather than being restored. This practice is not spread widely yet, but it has been tried and found to be very successful in the US.\n\nI believe Sabine&apos;s hitting would then end, her hitting being her cry for love and attention."

A girl is given a trinket on vacation in Egypt and it turns out to contain horrific powers of destruction. I told you it was silly.\n\nThe special effects are very 1982. But wait; this movie was made in 1982. I&apos;d recommend this to someone who has never seen a Fulci film and is not expecting to see &quot;Zombie&quot; or &quot;The Beyond&quot; again. This movie offers something different and something that I, a true Fulci admirer, appreciate and can watch over and over.\n\nYes, I like &quot;Manhattan Baby.&quot; While it&apos;s not like the aforementioned Fulci greats, it remains entertaining and it does deliver some good scares. And decent gore.\n\n7 out of 10, kids.",

His wife (Claudette Colbert), who loves him, decides to raise it for him by divorcing him and marrying a millionaire.\n\nOne of the more interesting things about this film is the trouble it had getting made thanks to the censorship office. Although there is no explicit sexuality or foul language, it does have some questionable themes. There is talk of prostitution, and apparently the censors did not like the way marriage and divorce were handled so lightly. Even after the necessary cuts, this remains a strong central part of the plot and humor.\n\nInterestingly, the Bill Hader interview on the Criterion disc adds a lot. You might not think of Hader as a film historian or critic, and maybe he is not. But he really understands Sturges and how Sturges wrote his scripts. He connects the dots between Sturges and the Coen brothers, as well as explaining how each character, no matter how minor, is important to the story.",

This film might give you a very natural, without pretentiousness descriptions of the miserable daily lives of the Chinese and the Thai people. Focused on the Chinese who were bunch of uneducated hard labors and the prostitutes in the big city of Thailand, through the eyes and brush of a Chinese painter. But all in all, the whole movie told nothing but meaningless and shallowness of the director&apos;s pretentious approach to tell nothing out of nothing. The whole movie was like the painter&apos;s paintings, although lined up in sequential orders from left to the right or right to the left, but none of them matched up correctly with each other, the colors of every part of the long combination of those paintings were completely different and out of proportion to each other.\n\nThe director had tried to use the camera without any feeling, not like human eyes but cold and mindless camera lens. The director with his camera lens caught his objects that he wanted to prescribe to the viewers/audiences, and then they inevitably became the 2nd cold, feeling-less and heartless lens to watch the monotonous portrayals scene after scene. There&apos;s no sympathy, no passion, no normal human feelings to any frame of this film. It&apos;s a long journey of nothingness and pretentiousness, going nowhere, telling nothing, wasting all the time, lives and money of the production and the audiences.\n\nWe usually describe a boring film so boring that it was more interesting by watching paint dry or seeing the ants on the ground in their lifeline to somewhere unknown on both ends. This is exactly the tag of this film; a film with big NADA inside out."

      "reviewBody": "... K2: The Ultimate High. Well, while I&apos;m sure climbing the actual mountain really is a great high, this movie does a mediocre job of portraying the thrill. It&apos;s not that the acting is bad, but the plot is pretty generic and predictable. Leaves you just a bit wanting in places. Too much &quot;made for TV&quot; juice in its veins.\n\nThe real strength of this DVD comes with its crisp video and pretty impressive camera work on the slopes. You almost feel cold and light-headed as you travel up the spine of K2 with the protagonists. No clues in the special features or jacket info about the actual filmed locations for the movie, but especially the shots from the climax at the apex connote well the feeling of reaching nearly to the top of the world (I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve revealed any plot twists here). I doubt the scenes here are all from K2 itself, but some good aerial camerawork make it just as well.\n\nNot much on the special features perks for this one. A chapter selection list and two bios, but that&apos;s about it.\n\nOverall, not a bad buy if you like moutains and climbing and can find it for a decent price. Recommended viewing with hot brandy and licorice."

      "reviewBody": "In this quietly scathing film from Fassbinder we have a portrait of a community and of a country. It happens to be West Germany, but could have been anywhere, and the words &apos; We belong here and no one else &apos; are as applicable today as they were back in 1969. The group are made up of men and women who talk to each other in front of a generic house with flowers on the window sills, and then they go to what they call a tavern and play cards and continue mouthing banalities that are so cruel and appalling that I wanted to close my ears to what I was hearing. The men when not talking abuse their women and this is portrayed as being casually &apos; normal, &apos; and one of the men is a male prostitute who kisses his male clients. Money and how to get it, criminally or otherwise dominates their conversations, if you can call them that. And they want the &apos; normality &apos; of this existence until a &apos; foreigner &apos; enters their community. Fassbinder himself plays this role and he is excellent. The foreigner is Greek and rumours start circulating such as his penis being bigger than the other men, and jealousy begins to enter this communal garden of evil. What happens next I will not reveal, but as in all Fassbinder the taking of money by fair means or foul is dominant. Personally I like Fassbinder&apos;s earlier films, and this I believe was close to the beginning of his incredible output. The near static nature and use of minimal sets has by some been put down to lack of money, but I believe he needed us, the viewers, to focus and the camera, almost unmoving, makes the content pitilessly accurate. I rate Fassbinder to be one of the handful of the greatest film directors and this film is in my opinion equal if not better than some of his last work. Sheer genius.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most amazing movies... Anyone who says that Gerard Depardieu portrayed Georges Jacques Danton &quot;wrongly&quot;, and who purports that Danton was &quot;not&quot; the huge, strong, charismatic, man of the people that Depardieu portrayed him as obviously has not done much research on the French Revolution. George Jacques Danton was like this exactly. The contrast between Robespierre&apos;s incessant paranoia and reservedness (conveyed perfectly by Wojciech Pszoniak...an EXCELLENT job) and Danton&apos;s relaxed approach towards the problems with which he was faced, extreme easiness and likeness among people, and the dynamic way with which he approached the mob of Paris&apos; unemployed masses and people in general was spot on: the two men were complete opposites. This movie developed the characters of the French Revolution so well, it is unbelievable. It ENTRAPPED the personalities of all those great, complex, astounding men that gave this extraordinary period of time its distinct shape. Saint-Just, Desmoulins, Robespierre, Danton, all of them...they were painted so accurately. This movie truly brought these incredible men to life. I have to say, the score of this movie was incredible. It brought out all the proper emotions. Overall, an astonishing movie."

      "reviewBody": "Paella/Chilli/Pasta Western co-produced by Spain/Mexico/Italy about an intrigue that involves several killings . A woman is accused for murder and a court presided by a stiff judge (Rafael Bardem) and a jury (Tito Garcia as Blacksmith , Francisco Sanz , Miguel Del Castillo) condemn her to 15 years prison . She escapes and is run over by a carriage . A young gunfighter called Frank Dalton (Paul Piaget) -from ¨Dalton Brothers¨- returns to the little town , Abilene . Fast-draw Frank results to be brother of the dead accused , who is actually innocent , and Dalton attempts to find out the real culprit . While the handsome , husky leading man , Paul (Fernando Casanova) , is appointed Sheriff . There takes place a murder and there isn&apos;t a clue . Paul decides to investigate the identity of a mysterious murderous . The prime suspect turns out to be Dalton , but the sheriff incarcerates the brother of his girlfriend Margaret (Barbara Nelli). Things go wrong when an anonymous letter threaten Margaret , Sheriff&apos;s sweetheart, . Then , occurs a string of killings : the inn keeper , the public prosecutor and other people , and without tracks . There are various suspicious but who&apos;s the killer ? .\n\nThis is a murder mystery Western in which a murderer strangles and slashes his victims and a sheriff along with a gunslinger to discover the true killer . It is an exciting western that packs a story full of violence , fights , killings and subsequent suspense , dramatic pace , plot twists , slick direction and mediocre interpretations abound . It contains an intriguing premise to investigate and to discover a killer , including red herrings , and results to be moderately entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . So-so Chorizo-Spaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and important Italian/Mexican participation , being rightly shot but with no originality ; and being proceeded in American style more than Spaghetti . Acceptable action sequences with rousing crossfire , spectacular shootouts and glimmer go riding throughout mountains and cliffs . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . It stars Fernando Casanova , he stand out chiefly in westerns and &quot;comedias Rancheras&quot;, Casanova appeared as an extra as early as 1946 . His break-through came in 1953 : after playing alongside star María Félix in ¨Camelia¨ (1954), and appearing in Luis Buñuel&apos;s ¨Él¨ (1952) and ¨Emilio Fernández&apos;&apos;s Reportaje¨ (1953), Casanova was offered the leading role in a popular serial directed by Ramón Peón, ¨Águila Negra¨ (1953), a hero of the Zorro/Lone Ranger type . After those films, he became a regular leading man in romantic comedies and action films . And played some Chilli/Spaghetti Westerns as ¨El Vengador De California¨ , ¨Duelo De Pistoleros¨ , ¨Sheriffs De la Frontera¨ , ¨Dos Cuatreros¨ . He made fun of his own early film persona in ¨Mecánica Nacional¨ (1972), and continued to work into the 1990s , still in action films but now playing character roles . Co-stars the notorious Spaghetti actor , Paul Piaget , father of model/actress Cristina Piaget , he is good in his usual tough role as a Pistolero who seeks vengeance against sheriff and townspeople . Piaget had a brief career , he dearly died by heart broke , he performed a few films , all of them Chorizo Westerns as ¨Seventh cavalry¨ , ¨Welcome Father Murray¨, ¨Three good men¨, ¨Hour of death¨ ¨El Zorro¨ and ¨L&apos;Ombra Di Zorro¨ .\n\nColorful and evocative cinematography by Ricardo Torres in Eastmancolor and Panoramic , filmed on location in Barranco de la Hoz, Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha, and at a Western little town in Hoyo De Manzanares (Madrid) called ¨Golden City¨ with sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia . Atmospheric and evocative musical score, but inappropriate , by Manuel Parada , including catching song ¨Cuatro Balazos¨ sung by Espinosa and Fierrungolla . The motion picture titled ¨Il Vendicatore Di Kansas City¨, or ¨Cuatro Balazos para Joe¨ or ¨Cuatre Balles Por Joe¨ or Four bullets for Joe¨ was well produced by Fernando Fuentes Jr and regularly directed by Agustin Navarro who directed some passable comedies as ¨Enseñar a Un Sinvergüenza¨, ¨Cuidado Con Las Personas Formales¨, ¨Cerro De Locos¨, ¨Casa De Los Martínez¨ and ¨De Profesión Sospechosos¨.",

However its more of &quot;Chandramukhi II&quot;, with focus predominantly on the actor rather than the plot owing to which it doesn&apos;t size up quite well. Had the &quot;Nagavalli&quot; been the core premise it would have taken the movie on a different level altogether. \n\nThe opening scene doesn&apos;t integrate quite well to the the actual plot. If you have seen &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; then the sequel gets quite predictable leaving the novelty/ suspense wiped out completely (infact there is penny dropping moment which should have been avoided). In addition, there are too many family members get associated with the &quot;Nagavalli&quot; plot making it confusing. The CGI&apos;s are shoddy and the production values remind of 1980&apos;s. Comedy is appalling. Vishnuvardhan smirks were unwanted.\n\nHopefully the Telugu remake should deliver a product with a greater impact and tie up the loose ends."

Expect low budget, but not too bad - i&apos;ve seen much worse in special effects and overall production. However, on its own terms it&apos;s a successful movie. It is much smaller in scale due to the lower budget, and is basically a retreat of the &quot;group of people trapped&quot; formula. There can&apos;t be any doubt that the movie could have been made better with more time and money its still however a considerate addition to a storyline with vast potential. The new cast is very good, possibly better than the cast in the first movie. Not the best movie I&apos;ve ever seen, but it&apos;s definitely a keeper."

      "reviewBody": "Before directing the Italian epics, Pietro Francisci began his career with a series of documentary shorts, including this lively little film about the production and distribution of Italian newspaper &quot;Il Popolo d&apos;Italia.&quot; After a busy opening montage sequence following the paper&apos;s journey by van, train, aeroplane, bicycle and paperboy, we then go back to the start of the daily cycle.  Reporters, editors, typesetters and typists join forces in what can only be described as frenzied activity to meet the strictly observed deadline.  Finally, the presses roll, and every stage of production is accompanied by a masterful and haunting score from top Italian composer Enzo Masetti. Unfortunately, in spite of these superior production qualities, the film suffers from one overwhelming blemish.  The SPECIAL EDITION of the title is being published to inform an attentive and apparently loyal population that Italy has entered the war.  It is 1940, and all Italian newspapers are obliged to pay homage to Benito Mussilini.  Not\n\nonly that, &quot;Il Popolo d&apos;Italia&quot; was actually founded by Mussolini himself and is the official newspaper of the Italian Fascist Party. Even worse, not only is &quot;Il Duce always right,&quot; but so are his new friends in Germany. The ending of the film is a total jaw-dropper: Masetti provides one of his heavenly choruses to sing a joyful finale, whilst on the screen we see Italian flags and swastikas billowing together against the sky, with a few words of wisdom from Il Comandante Supremo. In later years, when war documentaries were forgotten, Francisci and Masetti would team up again on hit peplums HERCULES (1957) and HERCULES UNCHAINED (1959).  However, one can only wonder if they lived in some slight dread that one day skeleton-in-the-vaults SPECIAL EDITION would come back to haunt them."

STR did not perform to his best. Except for Santhanam&apos;s comedy and songs....the movie is not worth to be watched. After seeing so many awesome roles of surya vikram kamal ajith etc in police stories, simbhu&apos;s police role didn&apos;t give the exact feel of a typical police. Most scenes were expressionless. And also the movie was too long...after consistent hits like dhill dhool and gilli we expected more from Dharani. To say in short &quot;Without Santhanam the film is nothing!&quot;.",

This time, what struck me was the intensity of Huppert&apos;s next-to-passive, almost casually indifferent postures of contempt for her husband. It is because of her being so minimal and apathetic that her performance harnesses its power and devastation. And this is what enhances Greggory&apos;s reactive performance as being so complementary, that of a once smug now tortured soul who slips and struggles to re-grasp a heart turned cold. He&apos;s just left grabbing air in the end. The looks on the faces of the chorus, their social clique &amp; the servants in the troubled Hervey household says it all.\n\nGoing in, I was reminded of another story of martial discord, David Hughes Jone&apos;s &apos;Betrayal&apos; but &apos;Gabrielle&apos; hit me as being more incisive and oppressive than anything I&apos;ve seen adapted for Pinter. I don&apos;t need to state the obvious that parlor films of this variety appeal only to those with an acquired taste. As for me, I can only say that I prefer the ice cubes that go with my scotch jagged &amp; stinging cold like the ingredients in this film.",

It&apos;s like watching a no frills music video today.\n\nThe jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds remarkably like Billie Holliday. That&apos;s a compliment folks.\n\nTheir instrumental work is tops as well. With the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes, this film is to be watched and treasured. No great production values, just a lot of good music.",

      "reviewBody": "A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their inanimate lives and don&apos;t know how to get out of them. Charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic, she has broken up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog, She&apos;s sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother&apos;s visiting and the bad relationship with her dad. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. All she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate.\n\nThen these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other&apos;s lives, there are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. Eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it.\n\nThe director&apos;s great work gives me an great impression, she handles the development of characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. Also I am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment, Delphic but full of desire.\n\nTwo main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are amazing in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing.\n\nThis Swedish indie film is about encountering and change, no matter you&apos;re homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the oddness of life exists everywhere, whenever you fall across it, you&apos;ll be hesitate and bewildered, but at least don&apos;t be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right way.",

      "reviewBody": "While the 2003 movie &quot;Sumuru&quot; is by no means an outstanding movie, it actually is a watchable movie, if nothing else.\n\nGranted, the storyline presented by writers Harry Alan Towers, Peter Jobin, Torsten Dewi and Sax Rohmer have elements of classic fantasy, laced with some light sci-fi elements. And of course it is topped off by a heap of scantily clad women and set in an Amazonian-like environment (Amazon as in the female warrior society, not the South American region, nor the online giant vendor). And while it does actually sound like it is a good combination for some geeky entertainment, the movie was actually not overly impressive.\n\nThe storyline was rather mundane and actually boring, and I managed to endure an hour of the ordeal, then I was tender to the core, good and ready to find something else to watch. And I did; I turned off the movie at that point, because I just didn&apos;t have the will or interest to watch any more of this.\n\nNow, what did work in favor of &quot;Sumuru&quot; was the production value, for the most parts. I will say that the movie definitely had a good production and editing to it, and it felt like a wholehearted movie, where it could just as easily has come off as being a project made by young adults for young adults. I liked the costumes and the props, and the setting of the movie was actually good too.\n\nThe acting in the movie was adequate. With the movie&apos;s premise in mind, you know you are not in for a grand Shakespearian performance here, nor will you witness any amazing performances worthy of top notch awards.\n\nWhile I searched this movie on IMDb, I saw that there were other - older - titles also bearing the name Sumuru in the title. I haven&apos;t seen those movie, so I have no idea what the connection is, or how the continuation of those movies is with this 2003 movie.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Sumuru&quot; was not a movie that provided the needed entertainment value, and it just succumbed to becoming too much of a low budget B-movie. My rating of the 2003 movie &quot;Sumuru&quot; settles on a mere four out of ten stars. I had initially settled on three stars, but the movie&apos;s overall production managed to lift up the movie a notch.",

      "reviewBody": "Some people might have two problems with the film: 1. It&apos;s rather old fashioned (which is a good thing in my opinion, I don&apos;t like the regular hyped mainstream trash). The plot is the kind of story that could come from a novel of Patricia Highsmith, and the look of the film is more like it&apos;s from the late 70&apos;s or early 80&apos;s. 2. The pretty complex story with a lot of strange (and maybe) almost unbelievable coincidences. And you don&apos;t get a simple positive character for identification. Exact the same way many french thrillers from the good old times were working (especially those of Clouzot). Though sometimes these films seem a bit too over-constructed (and I must admit I had this problem when I first saw Clouzot&apos;s &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;, 1955). But when you accept this (and life itself sometimes surprises us with strange coincidences too), you will see an excellent, very emotional thriller with great performances. You&apos;ll never know what happens next!",

Yes, it is slow, yes, the plot is paper thin, but ... it is a film to day-dream about, it transports the willing viewer to far-away lands on a wonderful journey made by two women on the eve of WWII. The exteriors provide a nice backdrop to the inevitable journeys of self-discovery of the two protagonists. The fact that the tension between tends to stay below the surface is never fully expressed only adds rather than distracts from the interest. In fact, I would say the subtle way in which possible storylines are suggested rather than made explicit only enhances the movie, and this is reinforced by its lack of closure. Strongly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Ang Lee&apos;s &apos;Hulk&apos; has always received a bad reputation and twelve years on, its critical reception is not likely to change. Despite being superior to the 2008 reboot, it has not been given the recognition that it deserves.\n\nBruce Banner works as a scientist with his ex-girlfriend. They are trying to achieve cell repair in animals, but to no avail. One day, Bruce is exposed to gamma radiation when a machine malfunctions; mysteriously he survives the incident. Only to discover that he changes into a ranging green monster, whenever he experiences high levels of stress.\n\nEric Bana as Bruce Banner does a serviceable job, you buy into his character, but Bana lacks the required enthusiasm on screen. He appears as a blank slate and you just wish that he would provide more emotion when it really matters. The tormented character is the driving force in the film and sadly Bana offers little extra. Jennifer Connelly as ex-girlfriend Betty Ross is more commendable, bringing tenderness to the role and thereby selling her affection for Banner in the process. Nick Nolte as Bruce&apos;s estranged father is a scientist gone mad from his past failures. You never can tell what he is capable of doing on-screen. The times we do spend with Nolte are indeed the most compelling segments of the film.\n\n&apos;Hulk&apos; is still sure to split the opinions of audiences in half. What some may consider being an interesting take on the tragic hero, full of emotion and character depth, others will be overwhelmed by its admittedly self-indulgent length (at 138 minutes) and disappointed with a lack of scenes that consist of Hulk smashing up anything that he comes into contact with. Unfortunately, the CGI can create a jarring experience, from the effects looking solid to poorly animated.\n\n&apos;Hulk&apos; does indeed benefit though, with a smartly written screenplay by James Schamus. This is a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to a hero that many will not be expecting. It is concerned with the psychological aspects of Bruce Banner and how his relationships with his father and his ex-girlfriend shape him. If you are comfortable with the story taking its time to set up characters and plot points, darker than your average super hero flick, then you are bound to enjoy watching &apos;Hulk&apos;. If not, then I would re consider whether watching this film is worth your time.\n\n&apos;Hulk&apos; is certainly better than its reputation would suggest. Ang Lee finds a way to make us care about a character that is essentially a giant green monster filled with rage. A sharp script helps to engage the audience, even if the running time is patience testing at best. For those that can appreciate what &apos;Hulk&apos; does eloquently with its ambitious story and artistic sensibilities then they are sure to have a rewarding and satisfying experience that is among the best that Marvel has to offer in the early 2000s.",

Sadly, Willis&apos;s part was completely uneventful. All I can figure is they must have paid him a nice salary and promised him he would be on and off the set in one day. They show him just enough that you think at any moment the film would take a dramatic turn and Bruce would jump into action. In the end, you could strip him completely out of the movie and it would have had absolutely no effect on the film. So therefore, this film will never be one that Willis will be noted for. If you are a Bruce Willis fan, as I am; skip this one.",

They assume the person watching has never heard of Mexico, they have clichéd characters and information overload so the movie-goer is &apos;educated&apos;.\n\nThe story packs in quite a lot, but in a relaxed style.\n\nIt&apos;s probably one of the most believable gangster movies ever made. The characters are well developed. They never apologise for what they&apos;re doing, but they&apos;re aware of what they&apos;re doing.\n\nWorth watching before if you&apos;re about to snort cocaine.

The memories are a combination of the most magical place on earth and the most tragic. I think many people who had contact with Haiti would say the same. The Agronomist is the story of a true Haitian hero and the ultimate price he paid for his passion to inform and enlighten the forgotten masses of people by running the only Creole radio station on the island. The tragedy is so many other well intention Haitians have paid the same price from a series of brutal dictators, who like usual have been supported and backed by other countries like the US and France (where you can see photos of Baby Doc on the ski slopes, while Jean-Bertrand Aristide got dropped in the middle of the Congo by our Compassionate Conservative idiots) The truth of the movie lies in fact then whenever there is a glimpse of hope some external events end up crushing it again and again. The film reminded me of my departed father, who had the guts to bring his family down to a magical place where its beauty is rivaled by its poverty. As a child I played in the streets with all the other children and blew any change I had on soda and chewing gum we would all share. You don&apos;t get that experience at Disneyland, thanks dad.",

It was criticized for it&apos;s excessive violence and Arnold&apos;s wooden performance.  It&apos;s brilliant score and memorable sets are ignored by reviewers, as is the well choreographed swordplay. Thirteen years later, BRAVEHEART is showered with praise and Oscar respectability.  It is embraced by critics despite it&apos;s graphically violent battlefield sequences, which are praised as exhilarating and authentic. Many of these battle sequences (as well as some of the costume design) bare just a little resemblance to the ones in CONAN THE BARBARIAN. Eighteen years later, GLADIATOR becomes a box-office blockbuster in a matter of weeks, taking in almost one hundred thirty million thus far.  It receives generally good notices from critics despite it&apos;s historical inaccuracies, poorly edited action scenes and predictable plot.  The basic story is reminiscent to the one told in CONAN, and the films violence is every bit as brutal. Isn&apos;t it funny how times change?  What was once laughable and disposable is now respectable.",

In a cluster of some really enjoyable (and some not so enjoyable) films, Bottle Shock really stood out from the rest. Out of all the movies I saw, I can easily say that it was the best. It was really something to see two bigwigs like Alan Rickman and Bill Pullman go toe to toe with each other. To see these two mammoth talents opposite each other is almost reason enough to see the movie, but the great performances don&apos;t stop there. Freddy Rodriguez delivers on some very strong and moving parts in the film that literally had tears forming in my eyes (Freddy is one of the best young actors Hollywood has to offer). As someone already commented, Dennis Farina is absolutely priceless. You will fall head over heals in love with Rachael Taylor who carries herself with a classic silver screen charm. And Chris Pine shows why he is destined to be put on the fast track to fame (but don&apos;t take my word for it, he is Captain Kirk in the new Star Trek franchise). As a whole, Bottle Shock is simply wonderful. Oh and not to forget one of the biggest characters in the film, the Napa Valley itself! This movie is so beautifully shot and set that it will take your breath away. This is one you MUST SEE!!"

      "reviewBody": "This one starts out originally enough. You don&apos;t usually see someone getting murdered by being decapitated by the jaws of a hydraulic digger. The dead guy was some sort of insurance investigator (yet again), but why he wished to dredge up a water filled quarry, and why anyone wanted to kill him, is a mystery only George Hilton can solve.\n\nYep - George Hilton&apos;s back in yet another giallo, only this time he has a moustache! Plus, he&apos;s playing this one ultra-serious too. First off, he tracks down the driver of the digger only to find he&apos;s hanged himself...except he hasn&apos;t, as George proves using the actual corpse of the driver to demonstrate! \n\nGeorge has a quarry-sized mystery on his hands here which seems to be tied in with the kidnap and subsequent murder of a little girl some eighteen months prior, and it seems that the killer is trying to rub out all of the people involved. And some that aren&apos;t really that involved, for good measure. George has to retrace what happened back then to find out what&apos;s happening right now, and you know what means, right? Suspects!\n\nSuspects! include shifty businessman William Berger, his sister, who is married to the one handed guy, and then there&apos;s the staff (especially the driver), and there&apos;s the guy who likes to paint nude children (can&apos;t see that scene occurring these days!) and also has a bunch of statues in his cupboard, similar to the one that the killer used. Patty Shepherd appears as a teacher, but isn&apos;t a suspect, so of course the killer cuts her up with a bandsaw in a rather gory scene - while she&apos;s watching Django.\n\nThe film veers wildly from gory scenes like that to drawn out scenes of policemen standing around, but, although lacking in the usual craziness, still manages to be a decent giallo due to George Hilton (and William Berger), a nice Ennio Morricone soundtrack, and taking the unusual step of having all the suspects gathered in a room for the reveal of the killer. What - no rooftop chase?",

Some of the Dylan aspects are personified as a young black boy using the name Woody Guthrie, a woman, and a middle-aged Billy the Kidd, for example. And the film jumps from character to character and then back again, frequently.\n\nChances are, if you are not an art film aficionado, you won&apos;t care for this one.

The main fault lays in the characters (none has the perverse charm of Gondorff and Hooker) and in those parts of the script that depict the heists (not by far as ingenious as in the best movies of the genre, but neither as hair-pulled and flat as in the &quot;Ocean...&quot; series). Fortunately, the direction is fast-paced and stylish, so this saves the day more or less. And... okay, I won&apos;t spoil the ending, but one thing should be stated: it&apos;s totally unlikely. You do NOT pull such an elaborate farce, ONLY to send (...) screaming in a motor boat without fuel in the middle of the Mediterranean.\n\nFurther, the perpetual use of the trick &quot;I&apos;m not who you thought me to be&quot; is hugely abused of, reminding rather of &quot;The Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. What really stands is the sparkling direction and the old-fashioned style, nostalgically recalling the end of the Seventies. For such a merry flick, it&apos;s positively refreshing.",

I have enjoyed his acting for a long time.\n\nWhilst I agree with some of the comments that the plot was a bit predictable, I still enjoyed the overall movie. Anthony did his usual sterling job, and I felt great empathy for the man who was suffering so badly but didn&apos;t know how ill he was. I wonder if this is a real condition or just fiction. It was fascinating.\n\nI must admit, though, that my favourite parts were when he was made up as someone else. The transformations were marvelous and it was fun to pick him out before he was revealed.\n\nWhilst it may not be an award winning film, I found it a fun way to spend the evening."

Nice storyline and plot about some villagers who are at threat by their leader Data Guru. No one dares speak a word against him except from of course Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar. Manoj Kumar is killed by Gulshan Grover while saving her from rape. Dharmendra is introduced in the film with his pure jatt background - singing in a farm whilst on a ford tractor, and drinking fresh cow&apos;s milk. He is first shown as a tru follower of Data Guru untill he finds his true identity and seeing this as a threat Data Guru shoots him but Dharmendra is back on his feet to sort business. Akshay Kumar and Karishma play their &apos;love&apos; scenes and Karishma plays Dharmendra&apos;s only loving sister, whilst Akshay is actually the son of Data Guru and brother to Gulshan Grover! Not such a nice performance by the pair except from a nice little song in the jungle - judge for yourselves! Dharmendra livens up the screen with his big presence while the comic duo Shakti Kapoor and Kader Khan play tricks on each other."

So, this one is at last watchable as for once, Blake changed his rules : no more the brightly illuminated and very cold American mansion, no more the frozen Miss Grey, no more the prude heterosexual sequences in which nothing happens. Sure, there is still the insipid soundtrack, it&apos;s more about massages than sex but Blake here went to Rome and has called 3 Penthouse Pets : Kyla Cole + Aria Giovanni + Kelle Marie. With Anita and the bunch dressed for one time without baroque erotic lingerie, the movie finishes to become interesting !",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;This Modern Age&quot; is a Joan Crawford film that looks like the picture was rushed into production before the script was finalized. It just seems to have some rough spots as well as an ending that isn&apos;t very satisfying.\n\nThe film begins with Val moving to France to see her mother--a woman who she hasn&apos;t seen in many years. That&apos;s because her parents divorced when she was young and Val was brought up by her dad in the States. While Val&apos;s desire to get to know her mother is reasonable, she doesn&apos;t realize that her mother is NOT the nice lady she thinks she is--she&apos;s a kept woman whose nice home actually belongs to her rich lover. In essence, she&apos;s an older prostitute--one whose current keeper is tiring of her.\n\nAt first, Val falls in with some vacuous party animals. When she&apos;s out with Tony one night, the car wrecks and she&apos;s rescued by a rich and handsome guy, Bob (Neil Hamilton). The pair begin dating and soon they are contemplating marriage. All they need to do is have her meet his parents. This goes just fine. But, when his parents come to her home, it&apos;s a bit of a disaster, as her old gadabout friends arrive and behave quite boorishly. However, that&apos;s NOT what bothers Bob--it&apos;s when he overhears a conversation with her mother and her lover--and he learns the truth. Bob is still interested in marrying Val, but he wants her to leave her mother and this raunchy life. She thinks he&apos;s just a snob (well, he IS a bit of a snob) and tells him to get lost. Then, when her mother realizes what&apos;s happened, she admits to Val that she is indeed a skank. What&apos;s next? See this and find out for yourself. However, be forewarned that the ultimate resolution comes WAY too quickly and isn&apos;t the least bit realistic.\n\nOverall, this is an A-picture whose script make it look like a cheap B-movie. Predictable and a bit silly.",

      "reviewBody": "Although a little boring at some points &quot;Autumn In New York&quot; managed to truly emotionally entertain and interest me. Even after seeing it I am still discovering the hidden meanings it tries to give us. Ironically despite being a romantic drama the romance between the main actors is the biggest downer of this movie. I must have missed the part when Winona Ryder&apos;s character&apos;s age is revealed, but she just doesn&apos;t pass as a 21 year old. I thought she was supposed to be like 26 or something. Not that there&apos;s a big difference in age, but she was a bit misscast, despite her child like face. On the other side she was really attractive in this movie and constantly reminded me of this cute girl I know. Gere looks and feels pretty old, but he&apos;s a believable 48 year old playboy. The movie is hence held together by good dialogues and nice and memorable scenes. There&apos;s also a great line Gere says to Winona after he cheats on her and realizes he screwed up: &quot;Can you let me love you?&quot; I&apos;ve read some pretty different explanations of this movie, but basically I think it&apos;s about Gere&apos;s character slowly discovering he&apos;s been missing a great deal of life, he&apos;s never loved. So after &quot;accidentally&quot; falling in love with Charlotte he can&apos;t bear the though of her dying and tries everything in his power to prevent her death(this might have something to do with his previous life where he was always the one with power, whilst the women weren&apos;t). But he has to realize that in Charlotte&apos;s case he&apos;s completely powerless and there&apos;s where the point of the movie lies. He chose true love (despite knowing that Charlotte was going to die soon) over the life he thought he was happy with. It might sound ridiculous but I kind o envy the guy. I too would rather truly love a woman, if only for a short period of time, than spend a life with a woman I didn&apos;t love. I would be a happier man, even after that true love would, for some reason or another, leave me, because I&apos;d know I loved, even if it didn&apos;t last. I was pretty surprised at most of the bad reviews and comments, but on the other side I couldn&apos;t help but to agree with most of them. It is a crude love story and it is somewhat predictable and boring, but it was overlooked for the most important reason it tries to tell us. Despite being an unconventional and hardly believable love story &quot;Autumn In New York&quot; is a movie that in the end managed to show me you have to take even the biggest sacrifices to find true love. Sad and Beautiful.  7/10",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing a trailer for this being re-released I was rather excited that a long-lost art film &quot;gem&quot; that I missed may be available to all but unfortunately it&apos;s really a slog.\n\nBelieve me, I do love a fantastic &amp; weird art film, especially from the past. It&apos;s a backbone part of my character and overall self, but through the years I&apos;ve had many experiences with these arty films that absolutely just has me going &quot;My god that was boring..&quot;. &quot;Flaming Ears&quot; unfortunately fits among those experiences.\n\nThe main credit here is that indeed a lot of the low-budget aesthetics are quite cool in that early-90s-fringe way where a lot of people wanted desperately to be away from the 80s but hadn&apos;t settled into the odd atmosphere of irony mixed with nihilism with an air of desperation that would basically define the decade (at least as far as I&apos;m concerned). Another interesting aspect is its primarily lesbian context which basically just is &quot;there&quot; and doesn&apos;t get exploited in a cheap or cliché way. Unfortunately, the &quot;just being there&quot; aspect is basically the whole film in general.\n\nIt&apos;s rather impossible to do much of any kind of synopsis of this film&apos;s plot/story or general ideas. Most of it meanders around one claustrophobic scene to another of vague conversation and what we guess are alliterations to something though it&apos;s always hard to tell honestly what that is. The problem I think is that the movie keeps feeling like it is trying to say something and basically keeps not doing so. I had high hopes for the outré weird factor after the opening sequence of a strangely dressed woman roller skating around a warehouse full of furniture where after zig zagging around some closets pours water (or gas maybe?) onto a classic-looking bureau/dresser and proceeds to have &quot;sex&quot; with it. I thought &quot;OK, now we&apos;re getting somewhere&quot;, yet that was pretty much the only kind of intriguing &quot;weirdness&quot; in the film. The rest of it just coasts along, mostly getting stuck in vaguely Dadaistic conversations and awkwardly slow pacing.\n\nIn the end, check it out if you&apos;re curious and maybe you&apos;ll see things I&apos;ve missed. Of note to experimental music fans is in the involvement of Austrian sound artist/composer Curd Duca, who shows up as music &amp; lighting assistant as well as a driver, interestingly enough.",

Also of course great landscape pictures and battle scenes with fire and explosions :).\n\nIt is for sure not the best Asian movie ever. And there is no compare with high end martial arts movies like Tiger and Dragon or Hero. \n\nAll fighting scenes are made more realistic then in the most other movies from that genre. If you like to see warriors flying all the time and a hero who can kill 100 men with a stick in less then a minute, then this is the wrong movie for you.\n\nIf you like historical Asian movies in the stile of &quot;a small country is trying to defend it self against an empire&quot; then you surly will enjoy it.\n\nThe movie includes a bit to much different characters. At the end of the movie i lost it completely who were all that guys which are died with great heroism :).\n\nAlso the love story, which seems to be essential in such movies, was not as disturbing as normal.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Machin is an amateur rugby league player in Yorkshire. Ambitious within the sport, Frank pushes himself in front of the local scouts and soon is signed to one of the professional clubs and able to hold out for £1000 down to join. As he rises within his own world, Frank has more resources and more opportunity but a strained affair with his landlady Margaret and his inability to shake off his basic roots see him frustrated and pained with his journey.\n\nLike many others have said in relation to this film, British cinema did have something at one point. The &quot;Free Cinema&quot; movement of the 1950&apos;s gave a home to a slightly more realistic form of cinema and, although I do not like all within that &quot;movement&quot; that I have seen, I do think that Anderson&apos;s work with that paved the way for this. At times the film is too keen to revel in the depiction of working class England but this isn&apos;t too much and perhaps, if you think of the context of the period (where such views were not the norm) then you can perhaps understand why. However the power of the film is less in its depiction of the working class work (although this is indeed of value) but more in the convincing exploration of the character of Frank.\n\nHere is a man who has aspirations but seems unable to reconcile these goals to be &quot;better&quot; with the fact that he is from the working classes and doesn&apos;t fit with those above him. Likewise he needs affection, love and intimacy but his outward emotions are much cruder and he is quick to lose his temper and resort to violence as the simplest reaction. It is a well written script and it doesn&apos;t push the characters or emotions past where they would naturally go for the sake of the film; you can see this in the conclusion which is meaningful and ultimately quite downbeat. Anderson&apos;s direction is suitably gritty and natural for the material, but it was Harris that impressed me most.\n\nHis performance can be mistaken for being a bit showy and loud and some viewers have made that call. However for me this was his character&apos;s boorishness, a quality that he sinks into with ease. However where Harris really does his best work is in the moments just before this happens, or immediately afterwards where, without words, we can often see this struggle, this conflict within himself. It is hard for me to describe here in words so think how difficult it must be to do as an actor but Harris pulls it off. He is well supported by Roberts and they share some excellent scenes. Smaller roles are also well filled with natural turns from the likes of Hartnell, Lowe, Blakely and others; but the film is Harris&apos;.\n\nNot perfect and perhaps a little longer than it can sustain, this is an impressive film. The working class depiction does seem a bit heavy at times through modern eyes but in the emotion and development of the characters the film is hard to really question. Engaging, well written and well delivered  like others have said, where are the British classics like this now? Four Weddings? Do me a favour..."

      "reviewBody": "I had missed a TV broadcast of this in the original Italian language as a kid though, recently, a snippet from an early sequence was shown during the introduction of the specialized &quot;After Hours&quot; program. Incidentally, these last couple of years I have been trying to land a serviceable copy of the film – both for myself and a film-buff friend of my Dad&apos;s – but, while this was the most satisfactory of three I had at some point, it still leaves a lot to be desired: gleaned from a German print (albeit Widescreen when the others were not) with the English dialogue mixed in, there remain several imperfections like audio drop-outs and fluctuating levels, while one brief scene is still presented in German with superimposed English subtitles! \n\nAnyway, the film was clearly made by mogul Dino De Laurentiis as a follow-up to another Russian-set epic, WAR AND PEACE (1956), which had been a co-production between the U.S. and Italy; this was a more European-based venture (inspired by an Alexander Pushkin tale), actually shot in Yugoslavia(!), though it still featured numerous English-speaking actors and a few of them were even ported over from the famed Leo Tolstoy adaptation (namely Oscar Homolka, Helmut Dantine and Vittorio Gassman). The others include Viveca Lindfors (as Catherine The Great – which is why I incorporated this in my current viewing schedule, as part of an intermittently progressing Josef von Sternberg retrospective), Van Heflin (as the pretender to her throne, a peasant who believes himself to be her deceased husband Peter III! – curiously enough, I have just checked out the thematically-related SHADOW OF THE EAGLE {1950} and which had actually employed a similar ruse), Geoffrey Horne (fresh from his secondary-cum-cowardly role in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI {1957} but now upgraded to lead/hero status), Robert Keith, Agnes Moorehead and Finlay Currie; the most notable element on the Italian front, then, is Silvana Mangano (Mrs. De Laurentiis herself) – obviously, albeit ably, filling in the female protagonist slot.\n\nAgain, in comparison to WAR AND PEACE, this was given a manageable running-time of 122 minutes when the earlier film had lasted for a staggering 208 and, while that one recruited two directors and two cinematographers (one foreign and one local in each case), this would only utilize home-grown talent in either department (with d.p. Aldo Tonti being involved in both pictures as well) – though Michelangelo Antonioni, soon to embark on his major art-house period, was reportedly brought in for a brief stretch during filming, as would also be the case around this same time with the peplum SIGN OF THE GLADIATOR! In any event, apart from the rich and sprawling visuals (pertaining to scenery, costumes and battle sequences), the main asset here proves to be Piero Piccioni&apos;s rousing score.\n\nThat is not to say that the plot is not involving – at least Heflin&apos;s bloodthirsty campaign, built more on his vainglorious personality (in the type of larger-than-life part Orson Welles would often get to play in such international productions) than actual battle tactics, and the no-less ruthless military strategies by which Catherine defeats the usurper (incidentally, the two leaders only get to meet briefly at the very end) – but it is bogged down somewhat by cliché (the eternal triangle situation involving Horne, Mangano and hissable villain Dantine), melodrama (Currie&apos;s disowning of son Horne after he is accused by the dying Dantine of treason) and sentimentality (not only long-suffering manservant Homolka&apos;s devotion to Horne but Heflin&apos;s enthusiastic attachment to same after having been saved by him from freezing to death).\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that I also own the 1928 American film by the same title with John Barrymore which, though still a Russia-based epic, it is set during the seminal 1917 revolution that toppled the monarchy once and for allthough the Communist ideals of the Proletariat regime that came into power in its stead emerged pretty soon to be just as oppressive as the old system (the long-term result of which was the country&apos;s dismemberment into smaller independent states and its former reputation as a superpower getting severely diminished in the process)!",

His vision for the project might have been clearer.\n\nBig plus: Leelee Sobiesky is a beautiful woman, and her assets are amply displayed throughout the film.",

Unfortunately, he never achieved the fame he deserved in reunified Germany - best highlighted by the fact that German TV did not even use the opportunity of his 100th birthday to honor him with a retrospective. Geschonneck is a marriage swindler in West Germany who comes back to his native East Berlin in order to retire and dedicate his remaining time to his daughter. Yet, she is just a chip off the old block and works in the same &quot;business&quot;. Father and daughter both try to get some money out of it while the police already tries to tighten the sling... The interaction between Geschonneck and his fabulous co-stars is really worthwhile watching. For me, this is one of the best comedies produced by East German DEFA studios.",

      "reviewBody": "The film version of &quot;Our Town&quot; is a thoughtful look at everyday life, often slow-moving, but usually effective.  Without any exciting or surprising events, it tells a worthwhile story and leaves an impression on the viewer.\n\nMost of the story follows the Gibbs family and the Webb family, neighbors in a small New Hampshire town.  We learn about their lives, loves, and concerns, told in part by a narrator many years after the fact.  Most of the time, things move at a very leisurely pace, with details about the town itself often thrown in.  It&apos;s worth watching because of the memorable and effective closing sequence, in which Emily Webb, who has married George Gibbs, finds her life in danger.  The sequence is creatively done, and brings out the importance of the otherwise mundane events we have seen in the rest of the film.\n\nThe characters are all nicely defined, with most of the cast doing pretty well, especially the character acting in the background roles.  The small-town atmosphere is also convincing.  There&apos;s certainly nothing spectacular about the film, but if you are interested simple human drama of everyday life, you should enjoy &quot;Our Town&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Grand Slam&quot; is a nice heist film, in search of an ending that makes some sense. The cast includes Janet Leigh, Klaus Kinski, and Edward G. Robinson, so the acting is totally acceptable. The intricate diamond caper is also depicted quite well, and the Rio locations another plus. What seems like an endless build up to the actual heist pushes the film into too long territory at just over two hours. Despite the length, interest is maintained until the startling surprise conclusion, an ending that will leave the bewildered audience gasping in disbelief after all that has preceded it. I defy anyone to explain the logic behind the ending of this film. To put things in perspective, even if things did take place off screen to support such a finale, it is far from believable, and leaves a very bad taste that is likely to linger for quite awhile. - MERK",

Even though my image of Senta as she is portrayed in the book was different to that of the one in the film, it didn&apos;t matter as her personality was accurately portrayed - indeed, all the characters were excellent. Benoit Magimel was exactly how I imagined the main character, both in looks and behaviour.\n\nThe impact of the events would have been greater to those who haven&apos;t read the book (ie I knew what was going to happen) but I found it satisfying and would highly recommend this film.\n\nRuth Rendell&apos;s plots are so clever, with a twist in the tail, and it is important that a film captures this, and Chabrol manages it perfectly."

Yes, 7 to 10 is considered the standard rating for a &quot;good&quot; movie, but there are multiple brilliant productions that are hiding in the 5 to 6 rating, that really don&apos;t deserve to be marked by that. This is one of those movies. My message, to whom ever is reading this, is really; don&apos;t reject a movie based on the rating by default. There are more entertainment hiding in the average shadows. The actors are really satisfying to watch, and combined with a fresh storyline, and paradoxical mix of thrill and comedy, this movie is one I will recommend.",

There are unanswered questions and missed opportunities which are hugely frustrating given the quality of filming.\n\nI was glad not to have watched this in a cinema because I would have felt trapped and assaulted to have sat all the way through the chasing and fighting in the last 20 minutes. As it was, with control of the fast forward, I could skip the repetitive hide and seek.\n\nThere was no satisfying explanation for this perverted stalking landlord choosing his tenant, and no intelligent reason for wanting to watch until the end, unless you just enjoy gratuitous violence.\n\nSuitable for post-pub group viewing, Resident is fine for mindless scares; but the lack of whodunnit and whydunnit just leaves the viewer wondering why did I watch it.",

The way they interact, with that old-mans-dignity which was comme-il-faut before the 1980ies is just fascinating and extremely appealing.\n\nIf you never were able to read Simones books straight through, you should watch this film to catch some of the atmosphere it was created in. It might help and it&apos;s certainly fascinating to watch them.",

      "reviewBody": "This is tripe dressed up in fancy clothes. A loose remake of &quot;A Free Soul&quot; this silly melodrama is a painless time waster and not much else. What was once a racy provocative drama has become an empty potboiler.\n\nTrue it does have Elizabeth Taylor at the peak of her beauty and that&apos;s always worth seeing. Additionally she is a much more relaxed and natural actress than Norma Shearer ever was. But she is handed a part that has been diluted from the original which is true of the entire picture. \n\nWilliam Powell, a welcome presence as always, isn&apos;t given the flashy part that Lionel Barrymore won an Oscar for in the original just a disapproving father without any real bite. No wonder he left MGM after this if this is the best they had to offer.\n\nThe real problem is the casting of Fernando Lamas in the old Clark Gable role, with Gable and his animal magnetism you could understand Norma&apos;s desire and willingness to stray with him. With Lamas, attractive though he may be, there is none of that and he comes across as a cheap hood made good and an oily one at that and Liz&apos;s headstrong determination to be with him makes her seem a foolish, spoiled nitwit.\n\nFor fans of the stars, and of course this being an MGM film they are beautiful dressed and the surrounding sumptuous, it&apos;s worth one watch but that will be more than enough.",

      "name": "Solid Serial with Problematic Aspect",
      "reviewBody": "This is another movie that I had never heard of until I was going through Letterboxd and it appeared on a list of horror films from 1931. Looking through this a bit, I was curious if it was going to be another one of those that is light on these elements or not. The other thing that struck me was the runtime. This is a serial that was shown in parts so binging it through like I did can make it problematic. To get into this synopsis, American adventurer Robert Grant (Walter Miller) is falsely accused of murdering an Indian noble and escapes to Africa in search of a diamond field and the real culprit.\n\nMuch like the synopsis state, we&apos;re starting this in India where Robert is meeting with the just and kind ruler of Rajah (Miller). Robert is actually on a business trip it seems and he&apos;s trying to sell a machine to him. Rajah is more intrigued how close they look like each other despite being from different parts of the world. Robert is made an honored guest and joins them on a hunt. Things take a turn when a tiger attacks Rajah, fatally wounding him. Rajah wants Robert to pose as him until his brother can arrive. The reason being to convince Prince Dakka (Mischa Auer) nothing has happened and he doesn&apos;t usurp the throne.\n\nRobert confides in a hunter of Harris (Tom Santschi). He asks him to keep the secret and take the letter. Harris sees a chance to make money. He reveals to Prince Dakka the truth of Rajah in exchange for when Dakka is king, he will pay him a large sum of money. Rajah&apos;s brother shows up though before he takes the throne with soldiers. To prevent them from looking guilty, Robert is blamed for Rajah&apos;s death and he is taken to prison. What is keeping him going is him knowing the letter is out there that could clear his name. Harris wrote his contract with Dakka on the back of it and it was signed.\n\nSome years later, Robert breaks out of prison and is in the deserts of Algeria. He makes his way to Lobanga where he seeks out the aid of Mustapha (Boris Karloff). It is there he also meets the other important people to this story. Robert seeks the help of Mustapha to track down Harris and it turns out they&apos;re friends. Mustapha isn&apos;t to be trusted. Through Peterson (Victor Potel), they learn Tom Armitage (Carroll Nye) has discovered a diamond mine. They want to avoid government interference to get rich. Robert meets Tom&apos;s sister of Muriel (Nora Lane) and wants to keep them safe. Complicating it more are Mrs. LaSalle (Dorothy Christy) who Tom takes a liking to, Mrs. Colby (Otto Hoffman) who is a secret agent and even this mysterious man in black glasses. Harris also has trained an ape man by the name of Bimi (Arthur McLaglen) as a henchman.\n\nIt becomes a dangerous game of cat and mouse with many twists and turns as Robert tries to clear his name, help out Muriel and her brother along with keeping Harris and Mustapha from getting this field of diamonds.\n\nThat is where I&apos;m going to leave my recap for this. To echo what I said in the start, this is a serial. It was broken up into shorts and there are 12 chapters for these. This is probably better suited to watch it with some gaps as it does get a bit repetitive to watch straight through like I did, especially when you have the recap at the beginning of each. I&apos;m going to try to not hold this against it too much, but I wanted to point that out.\n\nNext I want to go into what I find interesting. This movie is listed as horror, but it is quite light on those elements. With the time this came out, I can see why it fell into the genre. What is pretty scary here is that there are a lot of instances where animals are attacking people. This is interesting to show how wild the area these events are happening. I also believe this is stock footage that is edited in and works well. Having man-eating animals is pretty horrific. There is also a tribe of Africans that hold our character hostages and hunt them as well. This includes some racist things that I will delve into a bit later, but it is scary if you are in that situation. I do think this is less horror than some movies that we question today, but it is a different time.\n\nAnother genre that should be considered here is crime. Robert is accused of something that he didn&apos;t commit. He&apos;s spending most of this movie proving the truth. I like that for early scene, we are seeing him do some nefarious things to prove that. I&apos;m assuming this is pre-code in order to show it. He is willing to go back to prison though, so that could also be their out. Much like him, Muriel and Tom are also our heroes here. I find it interesting that they are all white as well. Robert for most of this movie though is posing as an Arab to keep a low profile.\n\nThe reason I brought up the last point though, Mustapha is presented as a character we can&apos;t trust. He is also an Arab here. I will say though Harris is white. Peterson, Mrs. Colby and the man in the black glasses are all white as well. I bring this up as we don&apos;t know if they are good or not throughout. I don&apos;t want to make this film out to be more racist than it is. It has it moments for sure, especially when dealing with the African tribe. Mustapha finds them to primitive and easily controlled. He&apos;s not wrong to an extent. They have a simpler lifestyle so some things they&apos;ve not seen before sways them. I just don&apos;t like some of the language or how they are presented at times. The ape man of Bimi is another problem I have here. The movie doesn&apos;t explain his origins so I&apos;m a bit more forgiving.\n\nSince I&apos;ve taken such a look at the characters themselves, I will go next to the acting. I think that Miller is solid in both Robert and Rajah. I would have liked to see an actual Indian actor for the latter, but for the story it needs to be the same person. Lane is good as our female lead. I like how outgoing and strong she is. It is interesting that Tom takes a backseat to her as a character. Santschi is good as this sneaky hunter of Harris. Another problematic role is Mustapha. I really like Karloff. I think he&apos;s a great actor and he fits the role fine. It is a different time, but I still would have liked to see someone of Middle-Eastern roots playing the character. Potel, Auer, Hoffman, Nye and the rest are solid in their supporting roles. McLaglen as Bimi is also problematic, but I again am not going to hold it against the movie due to the minor back-story given.\n\nNext I want to go to the effects. For this movie, we really don&apos;t get a lot and being the era it is from they were done either practical in front of the camera or edited in. The stock animal footage is fine. I did find it funny that for some attack scenes with a lion, they actually used a lion rug to simulate it. I could tell it wasn&apos;t real or at least alive anymore, but it is creative in my opinion. The camera is pretty static, but I do feel they had some outdoor filming here which worked.\n\nIn conclusion here, what I will say is that this is a solid serial. I personally don&apos;t know if it is made to be binged straight through like I did. Normally I&apos;m not a fan to start negative, but this is a bit repetitive and that made it boring for me. There is still an interesting story and concept here, especially for early cinema. I think the acting is solid across the board. There are some problematic casting and things that are portrayed or said for me though. I would say that this is still an above average movie despite my issues with it.",

      "reviewBody": "Creepy! This is an unfairly unappreciated and extremely effective Gothic horror flick from the late 60&apos;s. It is also one of the better attempts to bring literary mastermind H.P. Lovecraft to the screen. The acting is magnificent! Carol Lynley and Gig Young are in top form as the bewildered young couple whose arrival in the small, tranquil village seems to trigger off a series of bizarre and ultimately deadly occurences. Veteran character actress Flora Robson is genuinely affecting as the strange old lady who seems to know a great deal more than she&apos;s telling about the secret that&apos;s hidden away in THE SHUTTERED ROOM. Oliver Reed is appropriately menacing as a young roughneck. This one is a little tough to find these days. It&apos;s not readily available in video stores, and though once popular on late night television, they rarely run it on TV. But should you be so fortunate to come across it, don&apos;t pass it up!"

His portrayal of a cool-as-a-cucumber trader, even under incredible stress is delightful.  You can&apos;t help but be nervous as Nick Leeson dodges bosses, controllers, and his wife.  The level of the stress is clearly portrayed, and his fantasy scenes are great.    The other actors are shallow, but hilarious.  Enjoy this flic.  I did.",

      "reviewBody": "The darkest of Roger Corman&apos;s Poe chillers, though this yarn owes more to HP Lovecraft than Edgar Allan&apos;s poetry. Vincent Price gives his all time greatest performance in a dual role as possessed and possessor, aided by a wonderfully literate script by Charles Beaumont. It gives Price no leeway to indulge his tendency to sometimes ham it up.\n\nHere, he keeps tight dramatic restraint on himself, making his gradual transformation from kindly innocent to the reincarnation of his warlock ancestor a virtuoso portrayal of inner turmoil overwhelmed by fiendish evil. Corman even provides a last good role for Lon Chaney Jr (as he&apos;d done previously for Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Basil Rathbone) as a ghoulish henchman.\n\nUndeniably, &apos;The Haunted Palace&apos; does have a rather ponderous pace and music score that makes the film seem stretched as Price wanders down just one more hidden corridor. Floyd Crosby&apos;s widescreen cinematography is also unrelenting, capturing the drab, muted blue and brown pastels of a Puritan village plagued by witchcraft. And the barely glimpsed green demon lurking inside the vault was perhaps a mistake.\n\nBut Corman&apos;s skill on a 15-day schedule and a cheap budget is evident throughout. He introduces Chaney in a splendidly done sudden shock appearance that will still make unwary audiences jump (asked why he is preparing a room in the dark, he tells Price, &quot;One becomes accustomed to the darkness... here&quot;).\n\nTrue Corman fans will rank this chilling piece of American Gothic among his best. Not least where an exasperated Chaney asks the possessed Price when he will be satisfied avenging himself on the descendants of those who burned him at the stake. &quot;Not until this village is a graveyard,&quot; Price promises Chaney sibilantly. &quot;Not until they too have felt the kiss of fire on their soft flesh... all of them.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m embarrased to admit I avoided this film for years, despite its appearance in several curated movie collections, because it looked rather bad. Fortunately I finally caved after watching other Matsumoto films that were creative, hilarious, sad and unique, with deeper layers beyond their insanity as to never succumb to being weird for weirdness sake alone.\n\nDai-Nihonjin shares all these strengths with the dryness levels on the humour-knob turned up to severe skin-chafing levels. This will put off many viewers not familiar with this style of japanese comedy best exemplified by the cult director SABU&apos;s filmography.\n\nAs a deconstruction of tropes this is a rather genius work of art. The faux-documentary style enhances the absurdity of the situations and at the same time gives real weight to the plight of the hero, the eponymous Dainihonjin. Turns out having to be a hero sucks, it destroys your life, nobody likes you and maybe you&apos;re only making things worse for everyone.\n\nA lot of what makes this movie so charming is the intentionally bad CGI for the creatures that are somehow both hilarious and oddly terrifying. It reminded me of the bizarre existentialist Dreamcast game Seaman which is always appreciated. There are so many clever elements here that are always glossed over in other movies or comics like this. Just how do you solve the whole underwear problem when you grow from human to giant size and back?\n\nBeneath the comedy there is some genuinely smart commentary on the media, society and strangely enough international relations of Japan to its neighbors. While this is presented in a rather understated and subtle manner, being played straight thoughout, it all eventually erupts like a comedy volcano in the final ten minutes and just totally bludgeons you over the head. I can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve laughed this hard. I was in actual pain.\n\nThis is a hard film to recommend to more mainstream audiences but it&apos;s so genuine, creative and hilarious that it deserves more viewers.",

      "reviewBody": "From the mid 1950s&apos; too the mid 60s&apos; there was a Tsunami of &apos;Sword and Sandal&apos; films. In their native Italy they were referred too as &apos;pepla/peplum&apos;. Heroic strongmen bestrode the land defeating Monsters, Evil Tyrants and rescuing Damsels In Distress (D.I.D.). They went under many names. Hercules, Maciste, Ursus, Samson, Goliath and even &apos;The Son&apos;s of Hercules&apos;. Which had a catchy tune in the intro and exit of the film.\n\nMost of these films had either a brief appearance at the &apos;Drive-In&apos; or went directly to T.V. in the U.S.A. Production values were not the equivalent of a film like SPARTACUS (1960) nor the star power. Though occasionally a name Actor needing a quick cash fix made a appearance, like BRODERICK CRAWFORD or ORSON WELLES. Most times the lead was played either by a Italian &apos;Body-Builder&apos; with a Americanized name or a American such as STEEVE REEVES, MARK FORREST or in this film GORDON SCOTT.\n\n&apos;Maciste contro il vampiro&apos; (1961) made its appearance in the U.S.A. in 1964 as GOLIATH AND THE VAMPIRES or THE VAMPIRES. My Brother and I saw it on T.V. in a double feature of such movies that ran Saturday&apos;s during the Fall/Winter&apos;, circa 1966. Great Stuff! Our Hero &apos;Maciste&apos; now &apos;Goliath&apos; played by GORDON SCOTT was up too our expectations. As well as the Evil Villain, &apos;Kobrak&apos; the Vampire. &apos;Goliath&apos;s&apos; mission, save the abducted Women (D.I.D.) of his village. Restore the rightful ruler of Salmenak to the throne, &apos;Kurtik&apos;, JACQUES (Jack) SERNAS and rid the World of &apos;Kobrak&apos; and his minions. Mission accomplished in a entertaining ninety-one (91&quot;) minutes.\n\nThese films have a certain charm and nostalgic appeal, particularly for those who grew up with them. I remember them fondly and particularly my Mother&apos;s home made Pizza we were treated too while watching for lunch. Many are a pleasant surprise like this one which is credibly done. Rewatching this film and seeing JACQUES SERNAS was in itself a surprise. Remembering him from HELEN OF TROY (1956), IMDb********Eight. The main problem with these films is obtaining quality copies. In the U.S.A. most of the DVD&apos;s come from non-source material and that is reflected in their poor condition. If you can get by that you will find many worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "Quantum of Solace or Quantum so less, as some of its critics may call it, definitely lacks certain aspects of a traditional Bond movie. It may be eccentric in the sense that it may not be able to titillate the esoteric Bond fans as it may lack their eclectic style and taste but it definitely succeeds in projecting a new Bond for the contemporary world who may not be a coeval of a superhero, who despite being vulnerable has got the killer instinct in him, which is the very defining characteristic of Ian Fleming&apos;s larger than life human incarnate. This Bond goes about his business in a fashion which is far more realistic compared to the Bond of the bygone era with an incredible passion and utmost devotion which is nothing but inexorable. Though Casino Royale was the pioneer of this graduation but its Quantum of Solace that consummates it and gives Fleming&apos;s agent a mystique which has always eluded him hitherto, an aura which gives him an opportunity to be mortal and hence a chance to qualify to be called a human.\n\nQuantum of Solace is loaded with mind blowing action sequences which makes it a high octane extravaganza. The pace of the movie is such that you hardly get time to breathe freely. The plot though comparatively weaker than its precursor, is still good enough to keep one guessing thereby keeping one at the edge of the seat, all the way through. \n\nThe only aspect of the movie which should be under the scanner is its editing which is far from just and at times needless and severely annoying. A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. \n\nAll being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

When I bought the ticket to watch this film, I totally expected this to be a nonsense comedy that doesn&apos;t really make much sense.\n\nWhen you take that approach I think this film is way more enjoyable. I find it quite entertaining and laughable at some scenes (so are fellow viewers, who couldn&apos;t stop laughing at some scenes), and even though a little cheesy, there is a theme into it.\n\nThing I give big thumbs up are the costumes and props, it makes me realize the producer is taking this film very seriously instead of just a low budget stupid movie. The musical department also deserves lots of credit as the sex scenes are quite steamy because of the background music they use.\n\nAgain, this is NOT an artistic film, just take it as a bubble gum film that makes you laugh for 2 hours.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the later Spaghetti Westerns, and often compared to Enzo G. Castellari&apos;s &quot;Keoma&quot; from 1976, Sergio Martino&apos;s &quot;Mannaja&quot; aka. &quot;A Man Called Blade&quot; is a very stylish, and pretty brutal movie with some minor flaws. The comparisons to Keoma are quite plausible indeed, Mannaja was made only one year after Keoma, both soundtracks were composed by Maurizio and Guido De Angelis, and the leading actor Maurizio Merli actually looks a lot like the great Franco Nero, who played the title role in Keoma. It is often stated that Maurizio Merli only got bigger roles due to his resemblance to Franco Nero. Anyway, Merli&apos;s performance as Mannaja is great. Comparing Mannaja to Keoma, Mannaja had a smaller budget, but it makes up for this with graphic violence and genuine nastiness. The performances in Mannaja are great, even though it&apos;s pretty hard to come up to Franco Nero, Woody Strode and William Berger. The music composed by the De Angelis Brothers, which some folks seem to have disliked in &quot;Keoma&quot; (I&apos;m not one of them), actually fits into Mannaja very well.\n\nMannaja, an occasional bounty hunter and gunslinger who is fast with both his gun and his tomahawk, comes to a small town to collect the reward for a bandit he has caught. The town, which doesn&apos;t have a Sheriff, is ruled by an aging rich landowner named Mc Gowan, who treats the laborers at his silver mine like animals. Mc Gowan&apos;s right hand man, a ruthless killer named Voller, however, even makes his boss look like a nice guy in his sadism and unscrupulousness.\n\nMannaja has, apart from its resemblances to Keoma, many resemblances to earlier Spaghetti Westerns. Mannaja&apos;s back-flashes, for example, remind of movies like Sergio Corbucci&apos;s &quot;The Great Silence&quot;, or Sergio Leone&apos;s &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot;. Since these resemblances are only occasional, however, they don&apos;t make the movie worse. The performances are good, I especially liked John Steiner as the villainous Voller and Maurizio Merli as Mannaja. The character of Mannaja (according to the movie &apos;Mannaja&apos; means &apos;blade&apos; in a Native American language) is generally very cool, the fact that he kills with his tomahawk as frequently as with his gun (if not more frequently), makes the whole movie very stylish. All things considered, Maurizio Merli, who is best known for his roles in ultraviolent Italian crime flicks, is probably not as versatile an actor as Franco Nero, but he definitely made a great Mannaja. A nasty, ultra-violent and gripping Spaghetti Western, &quot;Mannaja&quot; is a must see for genre-fans!",

      "reviewBody": "There is a strong resemblance of &apos;Maria Braun&apos; to Curtiz&apos; noirish &apos;Mildred Pierce&apos;. While Mildred rebuilds her life after a personal tragedy, so does Maria, albeit in the backdrop of the post-war German economic disaster. Just as Mildred&apos;s loyalty was to her daughter, for Maria it was her husband Hermann (her man?). The two make sacrifices for each other hoping to build a better life for themselves. The major difference is that Maria&apos;s husband is a much more sympathetic character than Mildred&apos;s daughter, which robs the movie of some tension. Of course since Maria herself is not a very likeable person, one doesn&apos;t feel too much for her.\n\nThe story in a nutshell is of almost war widow Maria Braun rebuilding her life in post war Germany &amp; rising high on the corporate ladder till she realises that she has given too much of herself for the climb to enjoy the cause she was climbing for.\n\nStanding by itself, I still think this movie will appeal either to European baby boomers or serious students of Fasbinder. The narrative is straight forward &amp; the final TV audio track is a brilliant touch. Hanna Schygulla as Maria gives yet another great performance for Fasbinder."

The house is inhabited by a kindly old lady, but in truth she&apos;s a witch, and what she has in store for them....\n\n&quot;Hansel e Gretel&quot; (Never Hurt Children) by Giovanni Simonelli – Italy 1990, is, what we could call, a modernization of the fairy tale - Hansel and Gretel are going home through the forest, and on their way they are kidnapped by a gang that sells body organs to the rich in need of a transplant.\n\nThe children are taken to a clandestine clinic, and there they die after the operation. Hans and Gretel are buried in a shallow grave, but they will come back from the dead and take grisly revenge on all those who took direct or indirect part in their murder.\n\nThe story is good but it&apos;s not well developed. The film is a mixture of slasher and horror film, with rights to sentimentality, &quot;moral indignation&quot; (!) and tastelessness. The ghosts of Hansel and Gretel will kill and kill and kill, and they also have supernatural powers to boot. The killing scenes follow each other closely, and some of them will satisfy the gorehounds.\n\n&quot;Hansel e Gretel&quot; (Never Hurt Children) lacks tension, but those that have a sense of humor will have their fun, and in its own way the film is entertaining.",

Okay, maybe that doesn&apos;t really warrant an exclamation mark, but this is the tentpole franchise of Full Moon Features, now reaching ten films in all (eleven if you count &quot;Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys&quot;). Writer/director/producer Charles Band is also back, but I was kind of disappointed by this sequel. Our WWII era heroes from the previous films, Danny and Beth, are back as well, though played by new actors, and find a post-WWII Nazi plot to create an army of their own evil puppets to do their bidding, using a Re-Animatior like green serum extracted from our puppet protagonists. Not that any of the films in this franchise are exactly brilliant, but this one felt too jokey. I did like it when the franchise introduced the Nazi storyline and had our homicidal puppet heroes fighting the Axis Powers, but this entry was just silly and also continued the unfortunate recent trend of Full Moon Features including casual racism, seen in this film with in addition of an evil Japanese puppet named Kamikaze. However, I do still enjoy watching little things fighting big things (i.e. &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; &quot;Dollman&quot; &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot; etc.) when it&apos;s not CGI, so even though this entry wasn&apos;t all that good, it did still entertain.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is based on a very popular series of children&apos;s books written by novelist Martha Sandwall-Bergström. There have been a couple of adaptations of Bergströms books, but Kulla-Gulla is her most famous and revered work.\n\nIn the 80&apos;s Swedish public service(SVT) made a TV-series based on the same books.\n\nIts fairly simple story about lonely orphan girl Gunilla(Kulla-Gulla) who gets placed as an housemaid with a sharecropper, and then gets attention from squire Sylvester who asks strange questions. But why?\n\nThis film is utterly predictable in its Dickensian attempts to tell the story about a orphan with secretive past. But no wonder, since it is aimed at children and not adults.\n\nThe acting is fairly good, with Malou Fredén in the main lead as Kulla-Gulla. Fredén has only a handful of credits on IMDb and this film seems to be her last film. Whatever happened to her? Fredén does good job, and brings that kind of bright eyed optimism that this type of film needs.\n\nMärta Dorff as the comic relief role as Mamsell Modigh, one of the maids working at the Sylvester household. She makes a lot out of one smaller part.\n\nMargaretha Bergström does a great performance as an upperclass girl, Regina Sylvester. This is one the few great performances in this film. There are nuances, emotions, that Bergström carefully plays out to the audience. Reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958).\n\nOther then some few great performances this film is very bland, predictable. I would be surprised if even kids liked it. Disney massproduces these type of stories every year, so a kid today might be too sophisticated for this type of film.\n\nLuckily for director Håkan Bergström he made better films then this, like the noir crime drama Farligt löfte (1955). Future viewers should watch that film instead of this."

With the help of servants (instead of mice), Deanna gets to attend the ball, delivers an outstanding solo, meets the handsome &quot;prince&quot; (Stack) and has to fend off the insults of her snobbish cousin (Helen Parrish). \n\nThe slight plot moves effortlessly toward a happy ending. Durbin fans should love this one--it&apos;s easy to take and easy to love. Eugene Pallette gives a fine comic performance as her gruff uncle and the rest of the cast does a professional job under Henry Koster&apos;s direction."

Vivek comes with our Super Star for most of the scene but honestly speaking I didn&apos;t feel a great sense of comedy through him when compared to his previous movies. At one stage our Super Star is in bankrupt because of the hurdles made by the villain. There comes the interval ,after seeing the first half , I did n&apos;t feel a great impact on the movie, bit worried whether I am watching a movie which is worth of the price 20 Euro (double the price of a English/Hindi movie) I paid because of slow pace and normal comedy scenes.\n\nNow come the Second half, starting with Thalaivar tossing the coin and starting his revenge, from here the Movie goes like a Jet flight. Our Thalaivar rocks with the awesome look and style. Lots of humorous scenes and extraordinary fights in the Second half adds more feathers to the Success hat. The Most fantastic part of the Movie is the last 15 minutes where our Super Star turns from Sivaji to MGR, I wish MGR could have introduced much earlier. Movie ends with our Super Star&apos;s Victory over villain as well as in the movie.\n\nSivaji&apos;s technical team has done a tremendous job especially Cinematography, Art Direction,Editing... .\n\nFights and songs are too good where our Thalaivar has done a Kalakal(super) performance. ..\n\nAR Rahman ,no wonder about his role in the movie which is a major pillar for success\n\nShankar has used his high cost formulas in an efficient way for our Super Star which made me feel that I am watching a movie which is worth of the price, I paid.\n\n-Sivaji is a huge feast for Rajini Fans, you will enjoy 200% guaranteed entertainment if you search Super Star Rajini in Sivaji but if you search Shankar in Sivaji then only 20 % so enjoy the movie ,don&apos;t look for logic as well as Shankar. \n\nSivaji worth watching again and one of the BOSS(Best of Super Star)",

Upon arrival, the monolith is there, a balloon ride makes an interesting fanfare, jumping to Discovery, rebooting Hal to look and see, then instructions that they need to be elsewhere.\n\nIt&apos;s not the worst sequel you&apos;ll find, and there are some remarkably good performances from a heavy weight cast. Not sure it will resolve too much of the conundrum, the interpretation of the first is uniquely your own if you&apos;ve found the time to ruminate on it over the years, but compared to what it could have been, I wouldn&apos;t put you off.",

Now make it 10 times thinner, and you have an idea of this film.  And what happened to the dialogue?  Did anyone else notice this?  I swear, there&apos;s maybe about 10 lines in the whole film.  Well, I guess that&apos;s good, because it is deaf-friendly.  Not that ANYONE would ever want to see this.  It might be worth it to see Ashly Judd naked, but if you want that, you can see &quot;Double Jeopardy,&quot; &quot;Norma, Jean and Marilyn,&quot; or...hell, any movie with her!  Just make sure that if you do rent it, skip right to the end of the second scene, and then the bathtub scene.  Then stop watching."

      "reviewBody": "This movie sneaks up on you. You aren&apos;t getting the recent rash of over the top brash and crass movies of the current era. You are getting a cute and in the end a heart-warming comedy.\n\nTo begin, this movie comes at us from a small, down on its luck town who&apos;s main employer &quot;The Mill&quot; has recently closed. Maynard is one of the few remaining business owners, and his corner store is the focal point of the town. This is much like many small towns across America, so many viewers can relate.\n\nThe movie portrays a few pretty typical characters you might also find in those small towns and exaggerates their personalities just enough to make them quite amusing, but not overdone like an SNL skit.\n\nOne character that IS over the top is the &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; that comes into the town searching for bigfoot. (In a not so veiled spoof of Bear Grilles or similar reality star.) He is ridiculously funny, but it somehow fits.\n\nTo Me, this is a great movie to watch with the whole family. Three are a few scenes with minor sexual overtones, but PG is how I would rate it. And I can only recall a few occasions of foul language.\n\nI mention these things because I feel the shocking nature of many films today is borne of laziness. Writers and directors who are out of ideas and fall back on foul language and shock value as an answer to comedy. This movie breaks that mold and still generates the laughs.\n\nSo the bottom line is, if you are looking for a caustic f-bomb fest, this isn&apos;t the movie for you. Go watch The Hangover or something else. Those are funny movies for sure, but his movie takes a different route.\n\nThis movie has great acting, a great story and surprisingly funny scenes. A great way to spend an hour and a half with the family!",

This is one of the best Bank Robbery / Hostage movies ever made. Great realism combined with a perfect genre thriller - almost impossible to achieve. Dominik Graf prefers to shoot on video nowadays. He claims, that he likes the quick way of shooting, and loathes the time you have to wait to get a big movie for the screen financed in Germany. He&apos;s got a point there, but all this fast made movies for TV are forgotten as fast. I will never forget DIE KATZE - for it&apos;s great performances, great story, great mood.",

But I digress...Eva Loebau does a marvelous job portraying Melanie, who can constantly be counted on to say the wrong thing, both in her professional and in her personal life! We watched and cringed as Melanie made faux pas after faux pas, never seeming to learn, and being too proud to ask for help! As to the ending, the director (we saw this at a Sundance screening, and the director came up on stage for Q and A afterward) said that the end was meant to be more symbolic than literal. I didn&apos;t really think there would be another credible way to end the story, and thought that the director did an awesome job in this, her first film.",

It&apos;s the utter devastation of the third part, the ruined dwellings, the stripped trees, the people asking for help that isn&apos;t there, the men carrying coffins to the endless cemeteries, that brings it home.\n\nGrémillon is best remembered for expertly crafted movies in the 1930s and early 1940s, lush, romantic works that were star vehicles. He had started, like many film makers, in short documentaries, all of which seem to be lost. As a result, this film, which seems so atypical of the (relatively few) movies of his I have seen, fits in. After the war, his career floundered; he had trouble getting this movie released. The distributors said &quot;people are tired of the War&quot;. He made only three more movies through 1953 and died in 1959, age 61.",

      "name": "Mockingjay would&apos;ve been a rushed mess as one movie",
      "reviewBody": "When it was first announced that Mockingjay was going to be split into  two movies, I gawked. It&apos;s one book. How can there possibly be enough  to fill two movies? It didn&apos;t help that my sister also found it weird,  having read the book. She couldn&apos;t see any obvious place for the split.  Despite what feels like everyone else on the internet is saying, I  actually support the split now. Mockingjay marks a massive tonal shift  in the franchise, so it would have been a bit jarring introducing this  tonal shift for the final movie, leaving you no time to settle into the  new status quo left from Catching Fire. The biggest reason for my  support though is how rushed everything would have been.  When a book is adapted into a movie, there are certain time constraints  to be taken into account. That inevitably means things are cut, which  leaves many fans unhappy with the final product. With Mockingjay they  decided to give it time to flesh out the characters; give everyone a  bit of limelight, expand on various elements in the book, and just  generally make sure it doesn&apos;t frenetically jump from scene to scene or  cut out important plot points. Having now scene Mockingjay Part 1, I  can&apos;t imagine it being compressed into half the running time without  sacrificing the emotional resonance or rushing through everything.  The emotional resonance is the big selling point of Mockingjay. For  some it might be seen as boring, drawn-out melodrama, but for me it  made Mockingjay a darker, more harrowing movie than the previous two,  which says a lot about a franchise hinging on a fight-to-the-death  between children in order to keep the tyrannical dictatorship in place.  Katniss has lost her district, lost Peeta, and now lives in hiding with  a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the Capitol. To not dwell on  how that affects her and the people around her would have been a  massive misstep. The franchise needed to slow down and focus on the  characters.  To say it&apos;s only half a movie is misinformation as well. It feels like  a complete movie, at least more complete than Catching Fire ever did.  As I mentioned, Peeta is kept prisoner by the Capitol, and he&apos;s being  used as a propaganda weapon in response to Katniss&apos; propaganda by the  rebels. The whole plot of the movie is about this cat and mouse of  propaganda as the two opposing sides try to get an upper hand on the  people of Panem. The big final climax feels like the big final climax  of a story, bringing this cat and mouse to an end. It&apos;s final moments  are a resolution to the beginning and middle, and in that respect it  absolutely has all three acts. Of course it has a cliffhanger moment  right before the credits to segue into the next movie, but so did  Catching Fire (and Desolation of Smaug, and Fast &amp; Furious 6, and every  Marvel movie etc. etc.)  Everything else ticks all the right boxes as well; the acting is  top-notch, especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman  (with a little memoriam for him in the credits). The visuals are on the  nail. District 12 is now depicted in ruins, the CGI of the various  ships and futuristic cityscape of the Capitol is flawless. There was  also some fantastic use of CGI on Josh Hutcherson to make him look  progressively thinner and beaten up as the movie goes along, showing  the torture he must have been enduring. The musical score is fantastic,  with the Mockingjay theme coming well and truly into it&apos;s element, as  well as a fully fledged song that brings the rebellion to full strength  in the propaganda war.  Mockingjay proves that milking extra movies out of a franchise doesn&apos;t  necessarily have to be a bad thing (looking at you, Desolation of  Smaug). It slows the franchise down and gives you time to breathe  before the big conclusion next year, injecting plenty of heartfelt  emotion to the whole situation, fleshing out the world, developing the  characters etc. However it&apos;s not without it&apos;s higher-octane moments.  There&apos;s a number of action scenes despite it&apos;s calmer narrative, which  expand what was in the book to blistering effect (the fantastically  suspenseful climax is apparently just a few lines in the book, largely  glossed over). It&apos;s tense, unpredictable, emotional, yet has it&apos;s  light-hearted moments. I give Mockingjay Part 1 a very good 8/10. It&apos;s  made me very excited for next year when I can marathon the whole  franchise in one go.",

But..\n\nWhat I see is that love surpasses all realms of theory of existentialism, only true souls know they belong to each other and still live in the barbaric human society with rules that no one understands. This movie is so much in tune with my thoughts of looking for permanency, and being gay.\n\nWhen I see, Sean Li playing Ivan, it just felt like a whole documentary of a person&apos;s life looking into each aspect of a person from childhood to his death, the spread of life seen, rather seen too closely of Ivan and Windson, so up close and personal. Though Ivan sees a grim life, he brings in the essence of love, be it his grandmother or Windson. Love wins!!\n\nI loved all aspects of this romantic saga and yet felt ok to shed a few tears in the end. Isn&apos;t live all about just as in this film??\n\nOk next on to An fei ta ming...",

It has a message behind it versus Purple Rain. Not that I am putting Purple Rain down, I personally loved both movies. But this movie reflects on the previous movie and shows how The Kid has grown and continues to grow, while Morris and his crew are only concerned about money, sex and winning when it comes to The Kid. He still brings up low down things like the fact that The Kid&apos;s mother went crazy after the father passed. Prince shows a more spiritual side of himself on the &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; album and his singing and choreography is sure to please. Thanks Prince for helping me ace my schoolwork for once!!

      "name": "Samuel Fuller warfare movie in which a commando infiltrates inside Vietnam jungle against Vietnamese communists.",
      "reviewBody": "Decent adventure and suspense movie from Samuel Fuller with full of crossfire, drama, fights and violence. Action , adventure , war movie by the great Samuel Fuller in which Gene Barry leads a group of soldiers through the jungle and battling feared communists. Set in 1954, during the French Indochina War, near the end of the French phase of the Vietnam War, a group of mercenaries from the French Foreign Legion are recruited to travel through enemy territory to the Chinese border, to infiltrate enemy territory in order to fly a weapons depot. A Eurasian smuggler, Lucky Legs (Angie Dickinson), agrees to use her connections to help them, in exchange for bringing her son to the United States. The boy&apos;s racist father, Sergeant Brock (Gene Evans), is also part of the multinational group. Lucky Legs must use the love of a Eurasian guerrilla leader, Major Cham (Lee Van Cleef), to gain access to the base. In 1954, the Battle of Ðien Bien Phu was fought between the Viet Minh, under the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap, against the French Expeditionary Force in the Far East commanded by General Henri Navarra. It took place around the village of Dien Bien Phu and was the last battle of the Indochina War. Love and war in French Indochina! An American bomber trapped in love in a China at war!\n\nAn exciting and spectacular war adventure in which a group of multinational troops follows an officer against a communist stronghold in China to destroy a weapons depot. It is a violent adventure film that gained notoriety for its racial themes and notorious war scenes. The mainstream film was considerably criticized by filmmaker Fuller for its action and violence. Weak male leads, Gene Barry, Paul Dubov, Lee Van Cleef , George Givot, Maurice Marsac, Gerald Milton, James Hong, but Angie Dickinson shines as a Eurasian smuggler. This release gave Anie Dickinson her best character in years and her most compelling performance as she is truly magnificent.\n\nIt contains a sensitive and rousing musical score from Victor Young and Max Steiner. Victor Young had started composing the film score when he died at age 57. His friend Max Steiner, borrowed from Warner Bros, then shaped Mr. Young&apos;s notations and completed the soundtrack. The screen credit reads: &quot;Music by Victor Young, extended by his old friend Max Steiner&quot; . And Nat &apos;King&apos; Cole who acts as soldier Goldie, performs, of course, some charming songs, such as: ¨China Gate¨, music by Victor Young and lyrics Harold Adamson. The movie displays an evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Joseph F. Biroc, though well set in Vietnam; however, being shot in the US : Bronson Caves, Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park, Springs Drive, Los Ángeles, California, Estados Unidos . The motion picture was competently made by Samuel Fuller. Fuller being especially known as filmmaker of such exploitation films as ¨Shock corridor¨ and ¨The naked kiss¨ where he proved his talent of vision and intelligence .

And even though it was a fairly small part, I think this is Melanie Griffith&apos;s best work ever. The script, directing, everything came together seamlessly. I highly rcommend this film. Grade: A",

My favorite character was the older sister - a prostitute who is sassy and independent and doesn&apos;t take crap from anyone, but who has a deep sense of responsibility for the events that unfold and wants to do the right thing. \n\nThere are two scenes in the movie that are sure to bring you to tears if you have any sort of heart at all. I heard quite a few sniffles around me in the theater. \n\nGORGEOUS photography and GORGEOUS soundtrack. The music and scenery in this film will just take your breath away.\n\nThere are some imperfections in the film - it doesn&apos;t have that gritty, real western feel that you get from more intense westerns like &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. I would like to have loved &quot;A Foundling&quot; to have that harder edge, but it does have a lot of charm and heart which makes it one of the more satisfying independent science-fiction films I have seen thus far. \n\nIn summary: A nice emotional film with solid characters, a good pace to the story, and a lot of heart - could have been made even better with a little bit of gritty realism (but that&apos;s just my opinion).",

      "reviewBody": "Georgia (Nia Vardalos) went to Greece to teach at a university but ended up giving tours of the islands instead, due to unforeseen circumstances. She sends off resumes each week, looking for another professorship, but, until then, she tries to enlighten the tourists about the grandeur of Greece. They want none of it, usually, as they would rather shop or bask on the beaches. One day, Georgia gets a new driver, Poupi, a scruffy-looking Greek, and a new group of stereotypical tourists. These include Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), an American widower with a knack for making jokes, a frequently-tipsy couple from Australia, two scantily-dressed, Spanish women looking for rich husbands, and so on. As usual, they have no interest in Greek ruins but do like the &quot;genuinely fake&quot; Greek souvenirs. How will Georgia endure this without going stark raving mad? And, is Poupi hiding a handsome exterior and a kind interior under his beard? This is an enjoyable film for fans of romantic comedy but it is by no means especially memorable. That&apos;s not Vardalos&apos; fault for she has great comedic skills and Dreyfuss does a good job, too. Its more the lack of a surefire script and direction, for it is funny in spots but not-so-funny in others and it has a far too-leisurely pace, at times. On the plus side, however, the scenery of the Greek Isles is very beautiful and the costuming and camera work are quite, quite nice. All in all, if you love funny tales of love, this one will most likely be a good time for you and yours. But, it is not in the same category as this year&apos;s wonderful New in Town so, if you don&apos;t go with unreasonably high expectations, you will have fun.",

Anyways, I don&apos;t even know where to begin so here goes: Plot/action: The usual cliché plot line that involves government agency coverups, bad blood, and conspiracies to kill the President. I thought the first &apos;XXX&apos; was OK, but the plot of &apos;XXX2&apos; is so unoriginal and narrow-minded it makes the first one seem like an epic. The action and stunts aren&apos;t even imaginative,.. seems like even money can&apos;t buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you&apos;re even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to &apos;are we there yet?&apos; that it almost seems like him and Vin Diesel (The Pacifier) have teamed up secretly to harm America with such bad movies. Overall, I think that Ice Cube&apos;s character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment. The other characters in this movie including the main badguy (Willem Dafoe) are cardboard thin leading you to wonder as the movie goes along if the plot development will be just as bad.\n\nOverall Entertainment Value: 4/10,..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts, which made the first one much more easy to watch",

      "reviewBody": "No good deed based on a short story by Dashiell Hammett is kind of movies that have many elements and themes of a classic film no-ire but it is not exactly one of them. The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence. Second theme is domed love \n\nwhich in this movie is rather short, more of this later. The elements include mastermind and ruthless gangster, a femme fatal , and rude maniac hit-man. And add to these people a \n\ncouple that had a dream of living happily ever after. The strength of the movie is in building up of its characters. They all do what they are expected to do whether they act strongly or \n\nweakly. Their strength and weakness comes from their personalities and not from the requirement of the plot. Erin character is the main difference of this movie from classic femme fatal. As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense, though she is cunning in some scenes , but she is also deadly frightened. Her motives are dark at worst and suspicious at best, but in her main thrust of manipulations (getting rid of Tyrone) she deserves our sympathy. Other characters do not show something unexpected ,but the story has enough power and twist that make the movie worthwhile and interesting. Movie scenes are limited, and most of it is in closed places which intensifies a sense of claustrophobia. This kind of story which has little physical action and is mainly based on suspenses needs good acting, that fortunately this movie does not lack it. This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet",

      "reviewBody": "Do not expect to see a shocking reality about the life in North Korea. This movie is not about it. Some may perceive it as propaganda. I am pretty sure, that every scene was pre-arranged and approved by the state. It is nevertheless very interesting to see and listen how people think and live in a country we know so little about.\n\nTo me there is a huge paradox in the mass games in which the state&apos;s ideology &quot;the subordination of the individual&apos;s desires to the needs of the collective&quot; directly contrast &quot;to continue the State&apos;s policy of self-reliance and independence.&quot; So on one side the state is teaching about cooperation, on the other hand it refuses to cooperate internationally.. I think this movie gives a lot to think about various concepts..",

      "reviewBody": "Werewolf movies were big in the early 80&apos;s and this is one of the good ones. This horror/thriller has striking cinematography and sound, fine direction, and a good script, and very good Special Effects.\n\nA series of seemingly unrelated murders are being committed in New York City, from the penthouses of the super-rich, to the bombed out appearing South Bronx. Burned out detective Dewey Wilson (Finney) and terrorism expert Rebecca Neff (Venora) are brought in to solve the case. Coroner Whittington (Hines) finds a common thread.\n\nWolfen is one of the rare cases where lots of people working on one element improved the film, instead of hurting it. Four people are credited with the photography, six for the script, and eleven people worked on the Visual Effects. James Horner did the score for the film; a theme heard in another film he scored can be heard here, in an understated form.\n\nFinney is good as the burned out detective. Venora isn&apos;t believable as a terrorism expert, but very believable as someone who doesn&apos;t have the sense to stay away from odd noises in the South Bronx. Hines is cynically funny as the coroner.\n\n&quot;Wolfen&quot;is strong on technique, fair on acting. I&apos;d recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a simply wonderful documentary about the fighting in Ukraine during the Second World War. First of all, we see the Germans invading, driving the Ukrainians out of their land. Then the Ukrainians, with the help of the Red Army counter-attack driving the Germans slowly backwards. The film centres on the battle for Kharkov. It ends with the Germans being driven back across the river Dneiper.\n\nThe narration of events in this film is not particularly interesting. What makes this film wonderful are the images Dovzhenko uses. Near the beginning of the film we have beautiful images of the Ukrainian countryside and the people working and living in it - huge fields of wheat and sunflowers, swaying in the wind; orchards in blossom; reflections of the landscape in the clear river; people working the land in happiness. This strongly contrasts with the destruction we see when the germans invade - cities in ruins, villages destroyed, people fleeing the homes. One powerful image is of a woman lighting her stove, when that is all that is left of her house. At one point we see footage of german soldiers laughing as they march intercut with shots of destruction and death.\n\nThe battle scenes themselves are understandably a little confused and not particularly involving, although Dovzhenko does use some good shots of the smoke around the cannons, and his rapid editing is very effective. Some of the most powerful scenes come after the recapture of Kharkov, which lies in ruins. Various inhabitants are interviewed, telling of the cruelty of the germans, and we see truly disturbing shots of charred corpses, murdered children, and bodies heaped in ditches.\n\nThe whole film is narrated in voice-over, which understandably seems to be excessively keen on killing germans and a bit over the top in praise of the motherland. The subtitles, at least on the version I saw, were terrible: some scenes were not translated at all, and the english throughout was ungrammatical and badly spelt.\n\n&apos;Victory on the Right Bank Ukraine (1945)&apos;, also by Dovzhenko, follows straight on from where this film left off, but its imagery is not generally as powerful. 9/10",

      "name": "One of the better retellings of Shakespeare to date. ***1/2 (out of four)",
      "reviewBody": "O / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)\n\nAfter the disastrous attempts the last decade has made at updating Shakespeare, I eventually thought that it was nearly impossible to successfully modernize anything of the genre. Shakespeare&apos;s themes and ideas can still relate with many aspects of society today, but seldom do filmmakers incorporate modern culture with the timeless stories told so long ago. &quot;O&quot; is like a slap in the face that proves my theory wrong. Based on Shakespeare&apos;s play &quot;Othello,&quot; this isn&apos;t the first time Hollywood has tried to translate the tragic masterpiece onto film. In 1995, Laurence Fishburne starred in Oliver Parker&apos;s unsuccessful adaptation of the play. This time around, director Tim Blake Nelson has finally completed a victorious version of the story.and it&apos;s takes the form of a high school drama.\n\n The film takes place in an elite private school located in the American South. Mekhi Phifer (&quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;) stars as the title character, named Odin James, the only African American student at the school. That doesn&apos;t interfere with his reputation or image, however, because he&apos;s the school&apos;s defining figure. Rewarded MVP by the school&apos;s basketball team, he&apos;s a virtual celebrity with the student body, the basketball coach (Martin Sheen), as well as his beautiful girlfriend, Desi Brable (Julia Stiles of  &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot;), the daughter of the Dean of Palmetto Grove Academy (John Heard).\n\nHugo Goulding (Josh Hartnett of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;), the son of the basketball coach, is Odin&apos;s best friend. He&apos;s asked by his father to look out for Odin because of the straining pressures of Palmetto Grove Academy. Little does anyone know, however, Hugo is dangerously envious of Odin and the attention he receives. On the outside, Hugo is friendly to all of his basketball teammates, including Odin, but on the inside, he&apos;s concocting a bitterly evil plan that will render more than just the social status of his classmates.\n\nThis tale of treachery, jealousy, and mistrust will introduce a new audience to the genius of William Shakespeare and some of his most intriguing and intelligent characters. In this version, the film changes the original metaphor of war into that of high school sports. It&apos;s startling how the themes of the classic story translate so well to the lives of modern young people. The film thoroughly examine the emotions of its characters. Through jealousy, favoritism, trust, and envy, to popularity, conformity, and the extreme measure some will take to fulfill their feelings, &quot;O&quot; looks into the heart of darkness, not through a sadistic serial killer or demonic monster, but through one of the most dangerous figures of all, a friend with ulterior motives.\n\nWorking against an inconsistent editing style and an uneven soundtrack, the actors do an exceedingly well job with their difficult characters. Josh Hartnett delivers a performance that isn&apos;t excessive or physically violent, but instead internal and intelligent. He gives his character a face for the complex emotions. He doesn&apos;t seek satisfaction through random temper tantrums, but through developing a full scale plan. Julia Stiles projects a charming, passionate chemistry with her supporting characters. Mekhi Phifer also furnishes a strong, convincing image of Odin.\n\nPerhaps &quot;O&quot; doesn&apos;t fully exceed it&apos;s potential. It doesn&apos;t develop such possible themes as racism or one-sidedness. While creating a strong message on keeping friends close, but enemies closer, the film fails to examine a handful of themes that would have made the powerful, tragic conclusion even more effective.\n\n&quot;O&quot; was originally completed in 1998, but because of the recent violence in real life high schools, the studios were uncertain about it&apos;s content and rescheduled its release date numerous times. Maybe these actions say something about the movie&apos;s impact and how influential it may become. In that case, why wait to release &quot;O&quot; if the message is something today&apos;s teens need to witness, both to inform them on Shakespeare and to demonstrate the dangerous results of envy and jealousy.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1920s Ireland, many citizens have had their fill of British rule. In truth, the English soldiers who occupy the land are bullies and worse. This tale focuses on two brothers. One, Teddy, is a member of the IRA and dedicated to acts of violence to drive the Brits out. The other, Damian - Cillian Murphy- is a doctor about to depart for London to work in a renowned hospital. However, things change. Damian witnesses the Brit soldiers killing a 17 year old boy for only giving his name in Irish, when asked for identification. Suddenly, Damian realizes he is more useful at home, joining his brother. There are many struggles ahead; arrests, betrayal, violence, savagery. For every step forward in sabotaging the British rule, there is a loss of comrades for a step back. There may even be a development which makes Teddy and Damian enemies. Will Ireland be free ? This film is sadder than sad but a fine retelling of what and why the Irish wanted Independence after 400 plus years. In truth, the British surely come off as despicable bullies, no question. Also, of course, some of the IRAs actions are awful as well but understandable. Murphy is excellent as the pacifist turned Freedom fighter while the rest of the cast, the sets, the script and the direction are terrific. No, it&apos;s not an easy watch, being violent at many points. But, anyone watching will learn a history lesson that everyone should know.",

It&apos;s a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It&apos;s also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70&apos;s vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren&apos;t many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people.",

Nor a beautiful landscape could help this to become even passable. Any story to script about it -although both director and writer of the original book (Henri François Rey - Les pianos méchaniques) did cooperate in the script! James Mason is totally wasted and Hardy Krüger plays a totally silly role; only Melina Mercouri and the boy playing James Mason&apos;s son have a minimal script to work with. Do not waste your time watching this. For those who may be interested, director Juan Antonio Bardem is actor Javier Bardem&apos;s uncle.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t smoke, but I will tell you that from time to time my admiration of the smokers is that camaraderie formed given the gathering of like-minded (erm, addicted?) folks within Singapore&apos;s context of the yellow box, where they are permitted to light up and puff to their hearts&apos; content in public (now with even stricter regulations it must be 5m away from an building entrance). It&apos;s an &quot;us against the world&quot;, but that doesn&apos;t faze them at all. In need of a light? Well, someone at the box will gladly assist you. Need another stick but have smoked your last? Somebody else can offer you one. For free. And not to mention the many talk-cock-sing-song sessions that occur, where the yellow box has evolved into a bona fide grapevine for news, jokes and gossips to be traded. This yellow box bonding is much envied.\n\nBut of course that isn&apos;t reason enough to convert me, but it sure is reason enough for Hong Kong director Pang Ho-cheung to weave a romantic comedy based on this premise, and he does so with much aplomb in the opening scene being a direct result, that it just grabs you and holds your attention all the way until the end, with an astute sense and insightful capture of the essence and psyche of the modern day dating game. Being a young (though established) director, he combines the in-thing of today&apos;s technology, with SMS and doctored Facebook profile pictures into a commentary of sorts about the games people play when looking for love.\n\nHong Kong too has similar strict regulations in the areas where one can smoke, and these are all explained in the film. Ho uses them as a social background to weave the story of two characters - the English title is nowhere remotely close to the Chinese one, which is &quot;Jimmy and Cherie&quot;, named after the two characters played by Shawn Yue and Miriam Yeung, in a sort of Romeo and Juliet fashion and the likes. They meet at one of the smoking areas where they trade stories with folks from other parts of the neighbourhood, and soon become fast friends, hitting it off almost instantaneously after cosmetics salesgirl Cherie learns of the unfortunate infidelity of ad executive Jimmy&apos;s (soon to be ex) girlfriend, which provides enormous punctuations of laughter since she (and others not supposed to be in the loop) are sworn to secrecy.\n\nDespite their age gap (in real life as well) which is made explicitly known in the narrative, both Shawn and Miriam (last seen on screen some 3 years ago with Hooked on You, another Hong Kong romantic comedy I dig) share a lovable, natural chemistry which is hallmark of any great romance, despite roadblocks placed in their way like current relationships gone sour, and the questioning of the What If when someone else who does seem more like one&apos;s soulmate comes along. Unravelling itself over seven consecutive days, we follow these two wonderfully crafted characters as they hit it off, and quietly root for them to come together, though it&apos;s no mean feat, almost reminiscent of anyone&apos;s experience in a relationship when the beginning phase seems pretty awesome, until expectations start settling in and the mind games start to creep in.\n\nThe jokes here are laugh a minute when the director gets his story to deliver punchline after punchline which worked almost all the time, and shows his unique knack at pace and knowing what works. Included are some documentary-reel like clips containing faux pas interviews with the characters which while a tangent from the main narrative, contains plenty of rip-roaring revelations that continue all the way until during the end credits (which contains those which don&apos;t exactly fit into the main narrative proper). The main theme from the soundtrack is also beautiful to listen to, and becomes instant earworm.\n\nThis is another winner from Pang Ho-cheung, and is definitely highly recommended. I think it&apos;ll make its way to Singapore despite the focus on the smokes (with some redeeming factors), but surely, this is one film that will lose out tremendously if dubbed in Mandarin, since the colourful, fast-and-furiously delivered-only-in-Cantonese swear phrases will lose their shine (the audience was just going nuts!). Oh and thanks to this film, I will also want to try out the dry-ice toilet bowl effect, nothing like taking a heavenly dump!",

      "reviewBody": "A funny line from a funny song, but somehow it captures the mood of this light little comedy, made with enough wit and ingenuity to keep our attention, rehashing some tired gay stereotypes with a fresh approach, and in the end just offering a pastiche that should find an appreciative audience. George Bamber takes on his first directing role and uses a comic strip (Eric Orner) translated for the screen by David Vernon and populates his movie with an attractive cast of men (and women) and ably manages to make the individual frames of a comic strip almost become a smooth storyline.\n\nEthan Green (the talented Daniel Letterle) has problems with relationships: he has been in many from Juarez (Ramon De Ocampo) who still lives with Ethan&apos;s gay boy loving mother Harper (Meredith Baxter), to previously closeted baseball player Leo (Diego Serrano), to Kyle (David Monahan) to the very young Punch (Dean Shelton). The crux of the story revolves around the difficulty of selling Leo&apos;s house and the ways in which the various ex-lovers interact provides the somewhat frustrating line of dialogue.\n\nComic relief is supplied by two elderly gentlemen known as the Hat Sisters (Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle) as well as the shenanigans of the real estate people. Of course we know from the beginning who will end up with whom, but the getting there is fairly fun. The cast obviously has such a good time with the film that they forget to enunciate and so much of the dialogue is swallowed. But they are all fun to watch so it matters little that the superficial aspects of the story remain sub rosa. Grady Harp, October 06",

I&apos;ve seen Loose Change and several other documentaries that imply the same things as this one, however (no offense Dylan Avery) none of the documentaries that have come before this have been so professionally produced and edited. This one actually cites the SOURCE of the information. They not only speak to family members and witnesses but, as I said, they provide credible sources for every bit of data they produce. This is a documentary based in FACT and not Fantasy. It raises real questions and provides real proof. The people of our country should DEMAND answers.\n\nOn a side note I find it a bit interesting, and insulting that IMDb places this at the bottom of the page for this title: &quot;Recommendations If you like this title, we also recommend...\n\nWatch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us (2005) (TV)&quot; Please... this is NOT science fiction and we do not run around wearing tin foil hats and camping out at area 51. That is ridiculous and insulting. Imagine how the family members in this documentary would feel knowing that some people consider their cause to be equal to some UFO Sci-Fi garbage.",

      "reviewBody": "Compare with average Thai films,Faan-Wann-AAi-Joop is quite good. Each of the four directors present love in their own way. Each episode is different in mood and style, but all of them captured my attention the whole way through.\n\nAll the actors and actresses in this film did good job. They look very natural in their role, especially the girl who play &apos;Wan&apos; in the third episode, and the boy and girl who play &apos;Tong&apos; and &apos;Boy&apos; in the fourth episode. Also, the music is another outstanding thing about this film. After I watch it, I want to go buy the soundtrack right away. These songs are beautiful and go in line with the film well.\n\nThe first episode,Joop, is funny and a bit sarcastic. It&apos;s about a teenage boy who has to fight to the last drop because someone else is about to steal a kiss from his girlfriend. THe story is a bit non-sense but the style is interesting. \n\nSecond one, Aai, is romantic. A girl gets to spend a few nights on the island with her ex-boyfriend who left her without any other reason except &apos;he was too shy&apos; to be her boyfriend. I feel that there is a little chemistry problem between the two, but overall is OK. The story delivers a good message, although it was a bit awkward at times and the ending is cliché. \n\nThe third one, Waan, is sad. It&apos;s about a workaholic man who have no time for his wife and she began to lose her mind. She lived her life backward, let herself live in her sweet memory. The man realizes his mistake when it was too late. The acting was very good because Chakrit is a professional actor and the woman did very good job, too. (although the aging thing didn&apos;t look very believable.)The story overall was OK. The acting make it watchable, and the cinematography is beautiful. \n\nFinally,the last one, Faan, is funny, romantic, fun, and very unique! This is the best episode of the four. The story is about a dream of a young girl who is crazy about a band, and that dream leads her to discover the true love from a boy who is her best friend. I think it is very original, be it the story or the way the director present it. The visual and CG is stunning and those who like action cartoon would enjoy the dream part very much. The boy band, the young girl, the young boy, were all very charming and their acting is very spontaneous. I won&apos;t spoil your fun by giving anything more about the story but I just want to highly recommend this episode to anyone because it is very entertaining. You&apos;ll get the fun from the adventure in the story and the heartwarming feeling at the end. Thanks to great performance of the cast, the fantastic CG, and very, very beautiful music as well. Bravo to the director!\n\nSo, go watch &apos;4 Romances.&apos; It&apos;s not an award-winning film but it&apos;s not a waste of your time, either.",

      "reviewBody": "It was the early 80s, probably 1981, winter, a Saturday night, La région centrale is being shown at the Anthology space in Soho. I go by myself. Just a few months before, as part of the ReCherChez Studio run by Lee Breuer and Ruth Maleczech in the East Village, a group of us had rented a 16mm print of Wavelength to study it, and that had been most rewarding. I walked to the space. It was snowing and quite chilly. The Anthology was a small theater with a nice screen. There were maybe a couple dozen people there. I didn&apos;t recognize anyone. I do recall a group of young Asian men sitting together. I knew that the film had been shot on a specially constructed machine built to let the camera do a 360 degree pan, and Snow was hidden off programming the arm&apos;s movement. The soundtrack consisted of the electronic waves of the programming. So I knew what I was to expect.\n\nThe film began. A desolate landscape. Quebec. I am sure I had smoked some cannabis on my way to the theater, and I easily settled in to nothing in particular happening for a long time. I just kept watching. I am sure my mind was going off to all kinds of places as I watched, but I never really lost interest watching it go. After a while the pans began to pick up in speed, and eventually the camera began to spin around in a circle as well. The velocity was not very high at first so there was little disorientation, but you could tell there would be. The only human artifact visible was the occasional sight on the ground of the shadow of the arm holding the camera. Otherwise, nothing was visible but a desolate landscape with no people or buildings or anything in a constantly sweeping pan.\n\nAfter about an hour I began to squirm a bit in my seat. I knew this was a three hour film, and a couple of audience had already walked out. I lasted another fifteen to twenty minutes before I took a break. I used the bathroom, even stepped outside and smoked a cigarette. I recall it was snowing sort of heavily at that time. Then I stepped back inside, where it was warmer and welcome. I went back inside the theater and sat back down. The camera was zooming around much faster now. In short measures the camera started shooting around so swiftly it was impossible to keep up -- then it stopped and went the other direction! Now we were panning back the other way, and it was growing faster again. Then it changed directions again. It was hurtling madly swinging at the end of a tether, and the camera itself was revolving too. The universe was whirling madly before my eyes. It was astonishing and completely disorienting. In that era I was spending a couple of hours a week simply spinning in a circle, with other friends, at the studio, to focus myself physically and mentally. This film was an embodiment of that spinning. \n\nTime completely stopped for this. So did my mind. Suddenly my thoughts weren&apos;t racing, suddenly I was deeply focused. \n\nThe movement no the screen slowed down until it was back to the slow spin it had begun with. You could feel the film coming to a stop. The room went black then the house lights came up. The group of us there, some folk had certainly left and not come back, probably less than a dozen of us slowly rising to our feet and looking around at each other. Again, I remember mostly Asian guys -- in fact, it was an all male audience. I had sweat dripping down my face. It was winter and snowing but watching La région centrale made me perspire.\n\nNo other experience of mechanical images has ever done to me what La région centrale did. I later went to the NYC premiere of his So Is This film and got to hear Michael Snow speak and got to shake his hand. I enjoyed that film, and I&apos;ve also seen Back and Forth with an audience, and even went to a screening of Wavelength again in 2000 at the Hammer Museum here in Los Angeles. And I can rhapsodize about Wavelength at length, about meanings and all that. But nothing has ever come close to that viewing of La région centrale in Soho in the early 80s as an authentically startling alien experience. Even now, other than describing it, I cannot say why it was so powerful or why that viewing has resonated with me for over 35 years now. Maybe the central region is me?",

      "name": "Displeasing, unwatchable, ugly, basically it&apos;s quite fun",
      "reviewBody": "Kuso is one of the most displeasing and unwatchable films of recent times and this was precisely its point. It is directed and scored by rapper Flying Lotus (plus some aptly used Aphex Twin and Akira Yamaoka), features David Firth of &apos;Salad Fingers&apos; fame as well as some deranged animation of said Flash artist (Firth and FlyLo have worked together in the past and not just when they appeared on the same radio station in GTA V) and also, Hannibal Buress, George Clinton and (unsurprisingly) Tim Heidecker are in it. Already there&apos;s a lot to unpack but we&apos;re just getting started.\n\n The film is a series of sketches which Simon Abrams of rogerebert.com describes as &quot;a variety show from another planet&quot;. Alas, he also calls it &quot;too proudly low-brow to be considered art gallery material&quot; and there may be something to it. I am usually a connoisseur of anti-art and the grotesque, but a very unique talent is required to make something wonderful out of something intentionally revolting and/or bad. Had Kuso been less aggressive towards the audience and more concerned with exploring its own unspeakable universe, I&apos;m convinced I would have liked it even more. Yes, I said &quot;even more&quot;.\n\nThe segments we see are only connected insofar as they all feature the malformed American humans who have survived an apocalyptic disaster. Even as I knew this detail before seeing it, I still couldn&apos;t make much sense of the things I was seeing. They also don&apos;t happen one at a time, like in an anthology, but are rather spliced together with the occasional break for in-universe TV clips, surreal cartoons (many of these bits are where Firth comes in, and are usually the funnier parts of the film) and equally strange news reports on the disaster. There is also some confusion as to what&apos;s taking place within the film&apos;s &quot;real&quot; world and which bits are a story-within-a-story. One of the segments appears as a video game in another one, for example.\n\nWe meet all sorts of fascinating beings, most of whom look like they should just be put out of their misery. There is a black couple performing scarcely arousing sexual acts on one another, a mentally broken Asian woman who loses her &quot;baby&quot; behind fallen rubble as the voice of God (Firth again, I think) guides her through horrific portals and strange shapes, there is the small man with bowel issues who attends a private school in the woods where he also discovers a distinctly anus-looking creature (I dare not reveal how these two bond), there is the eccentric abortion doctor (Clinton) who will surely cure your fear of boobs, and also there&apos;s the female rapper who shares a crib with two inter-dimensional stoner lifeforms (Hannibal Buress and Donnell Rawlings). Because of course she does.\n\nIt&apos;s been noted that this film draws inspiration from all sorts of similarly grotesque and surreal works, including but not limited to Naked Lunch (consider the frequent use of insects and/or creatures that resemble human orifices), Crispin Glover&apos;s It trilogy, and the works of Cronenberg, Giger, and Jodorowsky in general (all three have a fascination with either straight-up body horror or just deformities in general). Beyond all that, there&apos;s a sense that this is approximately what a feature film adaptation of The Eric André Show would look like (particularly the scenes with Busdriver). Make what you will of that.\n\nI ultimately enjoyed watching Kuso. I loved the music, I found most of the effects and animations as interesting as they were beautifully unpleasant, and I liked a lot of the designs. All of this stuff had potential; it&apos;s just that, perhaps, it wasn&apos;t in quite the right hands and could have benefited from not being incoherent on purpose. I don&apos;t know how much sense this statement makes but it feels like Kuso should have been a film that serves to invite and engulf those who wish to see something this disturbing, and not stick it to those who don&apos;t.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame, since my favorite films are normally those that do things no other films dare to do, as is often the case with Kuso. But it does often play like a less funny and in some ways less horrifying Eric André Show or Steve Brule, and it does go too over-the-top for its own good (certain bits are effectively scary until yet another cartoon sound effect is played, which works as a jarring tonal inconsistency as opposed to an amusing defiance of conventions). Let me put it this way: just because no-one else has filmed a scene where a man rubs his semen in the mutated face of his lover before kissing her in an extreme close-up or a scene where FlyLo hallucinates his way through a breast-dimension, doesn&apos;t mean someone had to.\n\n FlyLo boasts that &quot;only 20 people&quot; walked out during its initial screening at Sundance in January. At the time of this writing, it is available on Shudder and on home video discs. Do what you must.",

      "reviewBody": "The film &quot;Die Unbesiegbaren&quot; covers an episode in German history, in which the Bismarck government tried to mitigate the rise of the social-democrat movement. On the one hand, the government developed her own social provisions in order to satisfy the demands and needs of the workers. On the other hand, a law was passed (Sozialistengesetz, 1878-1890) in which the social-democrat party lost the right to form affiliate organizations, to hold mass meetings and to make propaganda. The organizations were forced to continue underground, while hoodwinking the spies of the Prussian police. Nonetheless the social-democrat party (SPD) was allowed to remain present in the Reichstag with a fraction of 11, under the leadership of the famous duo August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht. In those days the social-democrats had not yet abolished the possibility of the road to power by means of a revolution. One should bear in mind that the European turmoil of 1848 was not forgotten and that in the year 1870 France still saw the temporary establishment of the peoples Commune in Paris. Not even the leaders were exempt from persecution, and Liebknecht spent some time in prison because of his statements. Note that the SPD had always included a right wing of Lassallian reformists, but only around 1900 did this wing gain in strength, among other due to the writings of Eduard Bernstein. Basically the SPD buried its revolutionary ambitions around 1913, together with the deceased Bebel. In 1919 the party decided to participate in the government. The episode of the Sozialistengesetz contains plenty of material for an emotional and exciting film. Somehow the illustrious Defa studios in the GDR did not quite live up to this task, since the script creates a rather languid atmosphere. The main character is the train mechanic Schulz, one of the lower party executives, who is active as messenger boy or pamphlet printer. He is a portrayed as a quiet person, calls his wife &quot;mother&quot;, and is bright enough to deceive the police and their eavesdroppers. Finally he is caught while distributing pamphlets, and is imprisoned for 11 months. At the precise day of his release the Sozialistengesetz is abolished. So what is wrong with this film? Well, perhaps that the dialogs and the relationships have a strong resemblance with the average Heinz Ruehmann film. Somewhere in this site a reviewer compared the characters in the Defa films during the fifties with dull and dusty officials, and I agree. Don&apos;t expect to see much emotions. In Europe and especially in Germany there was still that desire for law and order, where every person knows his place and willingly adapts himself (after all, Hitler was barely dead). For those who have not had the pleasure to see a Ruehmann film, searching for an American equivalent, one might compare it with the atmosphere in the traditional religious communities. Or in those cozy little towns of European settlers in Western movies (which were religious anyway). And it is true, that many films suffer by the excessive emotionality of the main characters. Whining and screaming persons may get their wants satisfied, but generate little sympathy. From time to time the Bolshevist ideology pops up. This is the case for instance in the ridicule of the SPD fraction member Karl Frohme, who advocates negotiations with the Emperor. Here the film-Bebel sneers down with the reply that dissidents shall be expelled from the party (a typical Leninist reaction). It is just to serve the people, but Frohme had the wrong ambition, added the film-Bebel (thank you!). Here Frohme symbolizes the collision between the ideologies of the post-War BRD socialist SPD and the GDR communist (Bolshevist) SED. Typical is also the unshakable belief, that the revolution is near, which is so apparent in the title: &quot;The invincibles&quot;. This of course refers to the class war. The Bolshevists enjoyed false heroism (hero of works etc.), and disliked the common sense of the perpetual motion of the political goals, which are so necessary for the incorporation of the experiences along the road. Evidently the film was destined to strengthen the identity of the newborn GDR. But the comment of the Viennese Filmschau (1953): &quot;two hours of party doctrine and propaganda&quot; is definitely of the mark. The West-German actor Alice Treff participated in the film (as Frau Schulz), and barely escaped from an occupational lock-out in her own land. Erwin Geschonneck plays Wilhelm Liebkecht. Verdict: the film is not bad but rather boring, and still has some value and interest because of its taste of the period.",

      "reviewBody": "You got (the now late) Mike Nichols, you got Streep, you got Nicholson, you got Nora Ephron adapting her own semi-menoir about her relationship with Carl Bernstein. Given the pedigree behind everything involved with the film - and, for me, I&apos;m a sucker for a good infidelity drama - it&apos;s only a shame this isn&apos;t, you know, one of the top films of the 80&apos;s. It doesn&apos;t quite get there, but it&apos;s not for lack of trying on anyone&apos;s part. Heartburn is an entertaining picture, even as it doesn&apos;t quite move to a beat of a fast drummer, nor does it have very easy solutions to its dramatic conflicts. But that&apos;s a good thing here; Nichols and Ephron know this story has people who can&apos;t resolve or move on too easily, despite all signs pointing in a direction the audience can read.\n\nIt&apos;s basically this: girl and boy meet, boy marries girl - though girl doesn&apos;t really want to marry exactly, and one of the funnier set pieces shows Rachel stewing about in the bedroom adjacent to the wedding as friends and family come to try and support (sort of) this whole union - girl and boy find a real &apos;fixer-upper&apos; house, girl is going to have boy&apos;s baby, things are happy... and then suspicion creeps in for the girl. A lot of this is not very much &apos;plot&apos; driven, though Nichols knows how to tell his story.\n\nIf there&apos;s anything &apos;off&apos; it might be that the pacing is a little lackadaisical. Not quite the same as &apos;slow&apos; exactly; you just have to be keyed in to the rhythm that&apos;s going on here. The filmmakers here are emphasizing character more. You get scenes, sometimes very funny, like when Mark just breaks out into a goofy song following the news that he&apos;s having a baby... and then breaks out into song again the next morning to wake up Rachel. A lot of the movie is more funny in a sly, observational way. It&apos;s not as &apos;LOL&apos; type of funny as work Ephron was to do after this, and some might say like those other movies it&apos;s a little &quot;chick&quot; centric. I can&apos;t say if it can be so easily pegged, albeit there are piffy bits like Rachel watching the TV and getting messages about the infidelities going on.\n\nNichols knows this material needs the help of its actors, and of course he has two of the best... ever, really. The charisma and combination just works, there&apos;s no doubt about that. And there&apos;s both real comedy and real drama to work on (probably more drama than comedy). And sometimes things happen in the movie that seem to be more incidental than anything to push it forward - i.e. Kevin Spacey&apos;s debut as a thief - but even this ends up kind of playing a part in the story, at a key moment, near the end. The actors make all these beats very, painfully, awkwardly, sadly and bittersweet-like real. When Rachel suddenly realizes that moment where things are &quot;wrong&quot; in a hair salon, the way it comes to her, how Nichols moves the camera (and, one of his gifts, knowing when NOT to cut), and how she looks and she goes from 0 to 60... it&apos;s wonderful stuff.\n\nWhy not great? Maybe a little too loose in parts, and the Carly Simon score is grating after a while and dates the movie (the songs too). But all in all, Heartburn is a very good movie about this relationship and its peaks and valleys, but also about the nature of indecision, and how something as seemingly clear-cut as &apos;stay with your husband - or go&apos; is a real, concrete, existential dilemma.

No.  And have you ever seen a more perfect, perfect ending ...?\n\nNo.\n\nRunaway Train&apos;s scene is set in a rather average prison sequence.  But as soon as the guys break out, the fun begins - Eric Roberts&apos; accent, the incredible feeling of cold, Manny&apos;s animal-like grunting (I think he was laughing) - and the pumping, spot-on soundtrack, raising goose-bumps beautifully as the train majestically appears through a thick flurry of snow like a ghost ...\n\nOne scene - Jon Voight&apos;s &quot;.. and you gonna RUB that little biddy spot ...&quot; monologue - is right out of the top drawer.  And the rest is as efficient and nerve-shredding as you could ever want.  Action (train crashes!!), blood (fingers!!), surprises, satisfying revenge - and an ending that, I&apos;m sorry but I&apos;ve got to go on about it a bit, is just simply breathtaking.\n\nHow I wanted the movie to end on that final shot, and how wonderful that it did, with the choir and everything.  Superb - a gem.  Just a gem.  And what a surprise - from the marketing, the hype, even the video and DVD sleeve, you couldn&apos;t pick this out from 1000 other bottom shelf dwellers in the video shop.  Just give yourself a treat and watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "Synopsis: Brahmachari was a poor young orphan who grew up to start a home for other orphan children. A struggling photographer trying to support the children. Once in awhile, with the help of the kids, manages to extract money from the landlord next door who keeps trying to sell his plot. But the prospective buyers always run away when they hear the noise made by the children. This makes for some hilarious scenes.\n\nLife goes on this way for Brahmachari and his kids until one day he meets Rajshree who is about to commit suicide because the rich playboy she was betrothed to and is in love with will not marry her. So our Brahmachari brings her back promising to transform her into the kind of beauty rich playboy (Pran) would fall in love with.\n\nWhat happens when brahmachari realizes he has fallen in love for the first time? Will he let her go to rich playboy? What happens when he realizes that he has to choose between his love and his children? Watch to see what happens.\n\nReview: Brahmachari is thoroughly entertaining movie with all the necessary ingredients: laughs, drama, romance and fighting. The kids are a riot to watch. The best scene in the movie is when one of the kids does an impression of mehmood in the classic song by mukesh, Hum kale hai to kya hua, dilwale hai. The music is also wonderful. The most notable being the immensly popular Aaj Kal Tere Mere Pyar ke Charche as well as the touching Main gaaon tum so jaao. Rajshree doesn&apos;t have too much to do in the film, but is decent. Pran is well Pran, reliably evil as always. Mumtaz is good. The movie is Shammir Kapoor all the way. Giving the best performances of his career, he got the best actor award for this film.\n\nIn conclusion, Brahmachari is wonderful movie for the whole family. Definately recommended especially for the Aaj kal tere mere pyar song and Shammi Kapoor&apos;s performance."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lost Continent&quot; (1951) is a film that I used to love as a kid, but hadn&apos;t seen in over 40 years. I still remembered parts of it vividly, however, especially the gripping image of a man falling to his doom through a covering of cloud, and wondered if it would hold up all these years later. The answer: well, partly. In this one, the prototype of an atomic rocket crashlands on a mountain plateau in the South Pacific, and Air Force pilot Cesar Romero is called on to ferry scientists Whit Bissell, John Hoyt and Hugh Beaumont (six years pre-&quot;Beaver&quot;) to the site, along with a few others. After a protracted but nonetheless suspenseful climb up the steep mountainside, which the band accomplishes with only ropes (and no pitons or carabiners!)--a climb that takes up more than 1/3 of the picture--our heroes make it to the top and discover a suddenly green-tinted world, populated with prehistoric critters. Although the switch from B&amp;W to that greenish hue IS pretty nifty, it must be said that these dinosaurs are brought to life by the filmmakers using what might be the lamest stop-motion photography ever committed to film; 1925&apos;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; did a better job at this! Still, cheaply put together as it is, &quot;Lost Continent&quot; is mighty fun to watch, mainly because the leads are so appealing and convincing. The presences of yummy &apos;50s gals Hillary Brooke and Acquanetta in bit roles doesn&apos;t hurt, either. Although the dinosaurs-on-an-island bit had been better handled three years earlier in &quot;Unknown Island,&quot; and the notion of going after a crashlanded rocket over dangerous terrain would be dealt with infinitely better in 1968&apos;s &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (and even in the 1963 Bob Hope comedy &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot;), this film still has a pulpy appeal that manages to strike a chord in me 40 years later. Watch it with the kiddies one night. Oh...nice-looking print on the DVD that I just watched, too!",

However, in a real-life scenario, the end result would not and could not have had such a clichéd &quot;Hollywood ending&quot;, so in that respect it sort of resembles a &quot;fractured fairytale&quot;. The storyline is credible enough with a bit of imagination stretching, the acting is tolerable, only the irony is laid on a bit too thick. I found the attitude of the principal character to be much too cynical, unrealistic and extremely condescending, even for the likes of some precocious, science-savvy prodigy. Getting back to the entertainment value, the plot progresses expectedly only it thickens toward the direction of the surrealistic, though the basic concept is actually pretty frightening. However, the movie is watchable with its impressive cast; a young Cynthia Nixon, John Lithgow, Chris Collet et al. I have mixed feelings about this film, I did enjoy watching it, but when I began to rationalize it began to appear quite nonsensical. So, if you intend on watching it, simply keep your powers of logic and common sense subdued and it will remain an enjoyable experience.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Clash of the Titans",
      "reviewBody": "Clash of the Titans is one of the earliest films I can remember having watched it as a kid in a big theatre, not the multiplexes we have today, and I liked it so much, it probably ranks up there as one film that I&apos;ve watched the most times, on television reruns, or off a recorded video tape. The story&apos;s fairly simple, but to a kid it had plenty of charm, and a basic 101 guide to Greek mythology, of which the promiscuity of the Greek gods struck me as quite odd, save for the need to produce plenty of demi-god heroes from which stories are spun of.\n\nPercy Jackson probably drew first blood in saturating the market about the new adventures of a fresh teenage demi-god, having him battle creatures similar to those found in this mythology. In fact, Clash of the Titans would find it difficult to beat the fun factor of the original film, and the modernized spin that Percy Jackson had to offer. There&apos;s little story here, and everything that happened was a sad excuse to get the story quickly moving onto the next big set action sequence. Lead character motivations had been changed significantly, especially with Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) being nothing more than a flower vase, and having her romantic subplot with our hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) being totally removed. I felt that was the first sign of narrative trouble.\n\nThen it became more generic approaches in how to string the action scenes one after another. Each battle will last a significant amount of time, then a little more posturing, before going onto the next. It can easily be split into this sequence of scorpions-medusa- kraken, and each creature design was a shadow to predecessors like Scorpionok&apos;s attack in Transformers, Uma Thurman&apos;s rendition of Medusa, and Hollywood&apos;s Godzilla flop, coming complete with that foam on water approach to the mainland.\n\nIf anyone wants to make a film about a hybrid character, then look no further than Sam Worthington, who has been half man half machine in Terminator: Salvation, half man half Na&apos;vi in Avatar, and now, half-man half-god who&apos;s tasked to save Andromeda of Argos from being monster sacrifice, should he be able to defeat Hades&apos; Kraken, the source of his power and threat to mankind. Worthington seems pigeon-holed into these kinds of role, and because of Hollywood&apos;s current dearth of worthy action heroes, Worthington becomes the latest It boy with his physique and perpetual scowl, being suited perfectly well into this scarcity of actors who can act with their fists, without the compelling need to launch into lengthy dialogue as a professional and career development.\n\nOtherwise the other star studded cast don&apos;t do much but pose and prance about in their costumes, with Liam Neeson looking constricted by his Zeus armour, Ralph Fiennes playing Voldermort all over again with his rendition of Hades, and Mads Mikkelsen as Drago the Argos general who has the nicest smirk caught on screen. Gemma Arterton is a surprise inclusion in the film as Io the immortal, which is a new character and given a lot more significance in the mythos now, and is in part one of the major changes in Perseus philosophy, tutoring and motivation, so much so that if I were to use a modern term, the word &quot;cougar&quot; would suit their relationship just fine.\n\nAnd it is these kinds of little artistic license taken, that will likely leave the purist in you perturbed. Bobo the Golden Owl has a quick cameo to appease fans, but like the gods who are never satisfied with the pittance of worship obtained from the humans, we too think that it&apos;s not enough, since Pegasus too went through a none too subtle change in skin colour. Sorry, but to me, Pegasus the winged horse, will forever remain white. There are a few conversational pieces in the film that brilliantly introduces us to the world of the jealous Greek gods and they work wonderfully, such as their innate differences and why the brothers Zeus and Hades hate each other so much, but some were rather cringeworthy, especially when modern curses somehow found their place in a swords and sandals film as this.\n\nI suppose you&apos;ll know by now that the film was never shot using 3D technology, and that it was only during post production, thanks to the mega box office success of Avatar, when it was decided to have a 3D version made for this film as well. The result? Millions spent enhancing nothing. Sure there&apos;s depth of field, but nothing to wow a jaded audience familiar with what a 3D film is expected to bring to the table. In fact, this film would be better off seen in a digital 2D format, since none of the action sequence even had a whiff of a suggestion of being in your face, since after all, it was conceptualized for a flat presentation.\n\nBottom line, it&apos;s extremely sterile and devoid of soul, whereas the original film had plenty of heart, and charming stop motion special effects to alleviate it to cult status. This one will likely be forgotten since it&apos;s nothing more than mediocre drama and ordinary set action pieces, though I will not deny that its marketing would ensure that it will garner some decent cash from the Easter holiday market segment. The original is so much better since this is all generic action and little charm.",

      "reviewBody": "A full six months after Reservation Road was supposed to release in theaters (it did, only in a very quiet handful), the film is finally, and again, very quietly put out on DVD. I had been looking forward to this film for some time and had been shocked by it&apos;s ill-treatment from Focus Features. After receiving it from Netflix and viewing it, I went out the very next day to purchase it. Where I was expecting a slow, wrenching exploration of grief and loss, this film actually surprised me with an untold amount of suspense and thrills. It certainly is not a &quot;thriller&quot; perhaps, but where the story goes and how these characters react leaves you on edge in several instances where you&apos;re not only unsure of what they will do next, but you&apos;re not sure what you would do next.\n\nI had read a lot about this movie before seeing it, so there were some reveals that I already knew about from my own curiosity as well as some misguided choices in what is shown in the trailer. I would have liked to see it fresh, so I will give plot points sparingly. Ethan and Grace Lerner (Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly, respectively) are a well-to-do couple living in an affluent Connecticut town who lose a child in a hit and run accident. Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo) is speeding home to deliver his young son to his ex-wife (Mira Sorvino) and leaves the scene. The unfolding story effectively explores how the Lerner family struggles to cope with an unimaginable loss to an unknown perpetrator, and how Dwight wrestles with his fragile conscience while trying to hide his crime from the authorities. I think it works better to not know how Ethan and Dwight meet and proceed to dance around this event, but when they do, is when the real enjoyment of this film begins.\n\nSorvino does a fine job, and Connelly, in a larger and more difficult role, does a very good job, but this film belongs to the male leads. Ruffalo is great playing a seemingly decent man who commits a heinous crime he desperately tries to hide. This is Ruffalo&apos;s best work to date and if this film had been appropriately marketed and acknowledged, it would have been a breakout for him.\n\nAs our main lead, Phoenix is just wonderful. Ethan is a devoted husband and father whose world suddenly ceases to make sense following this tragedy and seeing him pull away from his family as he gets lost in his depths of grief and fanatical in his quest to find the killer gives Phoenix room to further display his remarkable range. An actor who is blessed with naturalness and unbridled by affectations and shortcut tendencies, his portrayal of a man eaten away by unspeakable sorrow and incalculable rage is harrowing. There is a confrontation scene late in the film when Ethan is so incensed he&apos;s physically shaking, his words come out as a jumbled growl, and it&apos;s startling to witness. Seeing Phoenix actually show that level of anger makes you wonder how or what he did to get to this place. That I can&apos;t know, but I do know that it&apos;s terrifying to see this man come undone from the inside out.\n\nReservation Road is sad, but it doesn&apos;t wallow in a way that feels exploitive or cheap. It&apos;s a dual journey into one man&apos;s struggle to deal with a tragedy that feels beyond him, and the cowardice and humanity of a hunted man dogged by his own shaken ethics. This is a provocative, moving story that really deserves to be seen.",

Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better.\n\nThe plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it&apos;s just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended.\n\nThere was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end.\n\nDisappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "JULIA X is a very strange film indeed and that it works at all is down to the talents of writer/director P.J. Pettiette, who brings a ton of high energy slapstick to his production. This twisty-turny thriller turns out to be a black comedy of epic proportions, with virtually no story to drag down the pacing. It&apos;s simply a battle of wits between a serial killer and his supposed victims.\n\nThe film benefits immensely from the presence of former HERCULES star Kevin Sorbo playing the killer. Sorbo is a likable, lovable screen presence and that continues to be the case here; you just can&apos;t take him seriously as the villain as his persona is exactly the same. The story sees him taking a woman captive with the intent to kill her, but the tables are turned early on.\n\nWhat follows is a gruelling journey of violence as incredible amounts of pain and torture are inflicted on each of the leading characters in turn. The special effects are effective, yes, but the film&apos;s light-hearted feel means that this never ventures into real torture porn territory; the intention is to entertain, not to disgust, so it&apos;s surprisingly enjoyable. I usually hate this genre so it&apos;s saying something that I enjoyed this one.",

This film killed sleep that night.I was crying, with anger, empathy ...and remorse, because I have never done anything to highlight such miscarriages of justice.\n\nThe prosecutor in Mr Dregde&apos;s case - who could not admit he got it wrong, and made him spend 3 more years in jail. A seriously stupid and blinkered man.\n\nThe lack of conscience of the state and prosecutors - who did not expunge the records, and left these people with a tragic life on the outside, worse than if they had been guilty.\n\nThe one prosecutor who apologised is a man of honour.\n\nGovernor Ryan is a very brave man, and one of conscience - would we had more in Government! May I recommend John Grisham&apos;s book, The Innocent Man, For another tale of criminally inadequate judiciary - I don&apos;t even like him as a writer, but I was given this book, and slept less because of it.\n\nHow many people rot in jail because of incompetent prosecutors and lazy investigators? Thank God for DNA - as the film said - &quot;God&apos;s Fingerprint&quot;.\n\nI have never written to a website before - I don&apos;t like giving details for Spam senders - but this film has made me so ANGRY!!! Can anyone support the death penalty having seen such spectacular miscarriages of justice? The people not shown,on death row,whose evidence has been &quot;lost&quot;.\n\nThe lack of expungement, and thus hurdles in getting a job.\n\nThe FEE to get an expungement in some states - take my life and then charge me to get it back? Compensation for lost earnings, and for monies spent on defence, should be automatic for all exonerees - in most cases, they have lost the best years of their life, and their chance to establish themselves financially, through the incompetence of the justice system. The lawyers from the Innocence Project got it right - this should be a clarion call to all of us, to reform the system.\n\nThank you to the filmmakers for such a coherent and impressive film - and to those who helped finance it. It should be shown weekly on national TV.\n\n0",

      "reviewBody": "The film begins in a classroom. Outside, martial music is blaring and the professor inside the room is lecturing the boys about their duty to the Fatherland and encouraging them all to as a group in the German army at the outbreak of WWI. The film is exceptional in how it captures the enthusiasm and naiveté of the boys--as they imagine glory awaiting them after they enlist! Even in boot camp, the mood is light and the new recruits are excited about seeing their first action. This perfectly sets the stage for the actual war--not the sanitized or &quot;fun&quot; war of many films but the hellish and pointless mess that was WWI. The rest of the film is brutally honest and harsh and shows how the students die off one-by-one and the remaining students become more and more jaded and emotionally dead due to the fighting.\n\nI love this film and strongly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff. Part of my love of the film is because it was made relatively shortly after the war and the uniforms, trucks, etc. all appear correct for the period. Many years later, a made for TV version of this film appeared with Ernest Borgnine and Richard Thomas. It, too, was excellent but also was perhaps a bit too polished and pretty--lacking some of the grit of the original. Great acting, direction and production all made this original THE best of the anti-war films of the 1920s and 30s.\n\nOther similar great movies I strongly recommend are J&apos;ACCUSE (French), WESTFRONT 1918 (German), THE BIG PARADE (USA--silent) and THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK (USA). All excel at portraying war in a truthful and non-glamorized manner--it&apos;s just a shame that their impact of the world as a whole was negligible--particularly in Germany--where Fascism would soon replace the anti-war sentiment of the book ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In fact, his books and this film were banned once the Nazis came to power just a few years later.",

Damn, the man looked good!\n\nHorst plays Captain Kronos, a man who wears a snappy uniform and hunts youth-draining vampires in the company of an affable hunchback.  He also wears a bag on his head as part of some bizarre meditative ritual.  Aside from the bag-wearing part, he&apos;s a solid action hero, and it&apos;s a shame that Hammer never turned this good little movie into one of its long-running franchises.\n\nThe acting is a highlight: John &quot;don&apos;t call me Johnny&quot; Carson gives one of his typically likable and neurotic performances as Doctor Marcus, Wanda Ventham makes a lovely villainess, and Ian Hendry has an amusing cameo as an obnoxious thug (how the mighty had fallen, though -wasn&apos;t he a star at one point?).  There&apos;s also great lines aplenty and some nice choreography for the sword-fights. \n\nThis is the kind of movie that Full Moon - or for that matter, Dimension films - wishes it could make.  Alas, modern horror is usually too gross and uninventive to match the charm and creativity of a Hammer &quot;classic&quot; such as &quot;Captain Kronos.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "When Saturday Comes is directed by Maria Giese who also adapts the screenplay from a story by James Daly. It stars Sean Bean, Emily Lloyd, Craig Kelly, Pete Postlethwaite, John McEnery and Melanie Hill. Music is by Anne Dudley and Joe Elliott of Def Leopard fame, and cinematography is by Grant Cameron and Gerry Fisher.\n\nJimmy Muir (Bean) loves football, beer and women, his lads life is fun but certainly it could be better. Perhaps now that he is dating sexy wages clerk Annie Doherty (Lloyd) things are starting to settle in his life? More reason for optimism is that his football prowess has been noticed by Ken Jackson (Postlethwaite), the coach of Hallam FC, a man with friendly links to the manager of Jimmy&apos;s beloved Sheffield United. The world, it seems, is Jimmy&apos;s oyster, but problems at home, of the heart and socially, could scupper Jimmy&apos;s last chance for glory and life fulfilment.\n\nCompletely fantastical rags to riches sports movie with a keen eye for working class based social realism, When Saturday Comes is one of the better football based movies out there. But it is in a genre splinter that&apos;s hardly brimming with quality anyway. True enough to say it&apos;s treading familiar turf, and the ending holds absolutely no surprises at all. While the last quarter of film badly rushes to get to the &quot;punch the air moment&quot;, to leave the picture with a whiff of emptiness. But it&apos;s the off field aspects of the tale that strike the better chords.\n\nJimmy Muir is basically a good guy, he&apos;s just caught in the vortex of a blokey lifestyle. Themes of a parental stymie and peer pressure add a bite to the screenplay, especially since the backdrop is one of a working class place that offers only the mine and the brewery for employment. Football is Jimmy&apos;s beacon of hope, it keeps him sane, but can he be all he can be? As a character study, with Bean adding grit and emotional guts, Giese&apos;s film is assuredly a winner, if only the football aspects weren&apos;t so choppy and amateurish, then the film would be better thought of in the sports movie sphere.\n\nLed by Bean, the performances are up to a good standard, even Lloyd, who manages to get away with an iffy Irish accent because her portrayal of Annie is so spunky and grounded. The photography suitably paints it as &quot;Grim Up North&quot;, and Dudley&apos;s score is melodic and sits nicely with the various emotive turns in the narrative. There&apos;s issues and goofs within, especially obvious to those who know about British football, like how old is Bean? Mel Sterland playing for Sheffield United? A home semi-final in the FA Cup? And there&apos;s that annoying rush in the last quarter, where everything is condensed without thought to building up expectation. But it shoots and scores most of the time, particularly when away from the football pitch. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is pretty entertaining. That, however, doesn&apos;t mean that it has a great script. The truth is, DC played safe on this one, and it pays off, mostly.\n\nI was never bored throughout this movie, but that is not because of the clever dialogue, or the the amazing score. No, it&apos;s because everything in it is incredibly over-the-top. No kidding, be it the heroes or the villains, the action scenes or the romantic ones, every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated. Sometimes it worked for me, but sometimes it didn&apos;t. With that in mind, let&apos;s get to my pros and cons.\n\nFirst, what i liked the most: the direction, specially during the action scenes. James Wan managed to differentiate himself from that Snyder style of action pretty well (there&apos;s still one or two &quot;Snyder slowmo&quot; kind of shots, but that&apos;s it). The fight sequences were well choreographed and shot, with wide angles for most of the time. It was very pleasant to see. Now, I usually don&apos;t like when movies start looking like videogames, but it didn&apos;t really bother me here. During the gigantic CGI battlescenes you&apos;ve seen in the trailers, the amount of elements on-screen can be overwhelming, but for the most part, they are well enough shot that you can differentiate what&apos;s going on, and so they eventually become quite satisfying. The interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining, but then again, because Aquaman is just really extravagant most of the time, so it becomes this quirky, awkward chemestry. But that leads me into the cons.\n\nYeah, remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here? Well, sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting, or just unintentionally funny scenes. For example (and I don&apos;t wanna spoil here), the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this &quot;lovey dovey&quot; scene, but that just took me out of the film because it&apos;s so over-the-top and doesn&apos;t fit at all with the previously established tone of the film. It was weird. Not only that, but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like he&apos;s a football commentator announcing a goal, like he&apos;s really badass when in reality it just comes off as &quot;just too much&quot;. I won&apos;t lie, I started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie. Most of these are nitpicks, but because this movie blows everything out of proportion, these small problems end up REALLY standing out. Some bigger complaints are: characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations. The movie is also filled with cliches, but that&apos;s mostly because Aquaman follows the standard superhero movie formula. On top of that, i found some inconsistencies regarding character&apos;s abilities (like, it is established that inhabitants of Atlantis cannot breath outside of the water, but during certain moments they do it just fine). The CGI is very inconsistent, from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom, to some pretty terrible green screen effects. The dialogue, is mostly not very well written. Some characters don&apos;t suffer from it, including Aquaman, because it ends up fitting their personality, but some characters end up sounding really artificial. The acting is fine. Willem Dafoe is Willem Dafoe, Jason Momoa is Jason Momoa. Temuera Morrison, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren all did fine with their respective characters. I think the worst ones are the villains, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen and specially Patrick Wilson (who&apos;s character is the embodiment of &quot;over-the-top&quot;). Too bad, I don&apos;t consider him a bad actor, but goddamn was he subpar in this one. I don&apos;t have major complaints wit the editing. It&apos;s pretty good, except once or twice where there&apos;s just too much going on on-screen and I couldn&apos;t follow it, but those were rare moments. However, the sound design has some odd choices. There&apos;s this scene where a certain character is handling a knife, and every time he gently touched it, the knife went &quot;KATCHING&quot; with that standard blade sound , but just extremely loudly and exaggerated. I just thought to myself &quot;what?&quot;.\n\nDespite the fact that i nitpicked a lot, i think this movie works more than it doesn&apos;t. Yes, it&apos;s as a standard superhero movie as you can get, but it&apos;s a good one. Even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems, it&apos;s not a bad movie. The direction is quite good, some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying. It&apos;s pure, blown out of proportion, massive CGI fest fun, and I think that&apos;s enough for me. For an Aquaman movie, it does everything it should.",

      "reviewBody": "Dumped onto DVD with little fanfare under the generic title SEX ADVICE, SESSO IN CONFESSIONALE (or &quot;Sex in the Confessional&quot; in more accurate English) is, rather than the mondo-style doc promised by its advertising, more a scabrous and very period-appropriate critique of the Catholic church&apos;s attitudes on sex. If anything, the structure of the film more resembles one of the German REPORT films, centered on short, supposedly true vignettes.\n\nStructure is fairly loose, and mostly built around people seen confessing or seeking guidance in a Catholic church. In addition to providing absolution, the priests serve as confidantes and psychiatrists, too. Of course, there&apos;s the expected litany of schoolgirl-style &quot;I was heavy petting, father - is it a sin?&quot; questions, but several of the parishioners also seek guidance on whether they can use birth control or family planning. As expected, the priests&apos; responses - now decades out-of-date - are uniformly cringe-inducing: it&apos;s maddening to watch one guy tell a parishioner who&apos;s having great, fulfilling sex with his wife that he needs to stop if he&apos;s unwilling to have more children. Generally, most of the supplicants seem like sane, well-meaning individuals who only have their lives complicated by a bunch of uptight moralists introducing pointless rules and inventing problems.\n\nNot that the film would articulate its thesis quite like that, but it does ultimately seem to be what it boils down to. While the movie uses these confessions as bridges to quick, semi-salacious scenes of the subjects people are talking about, the heart of its argument is found in equally brief interviews with feminists, sociologists, sex researchers, and various men and women on the street. Almost uniformly, they rebuke the clergy&apos;s advice, insisting that in a modern society things like premarital sex and birth control are necessary for people to form healthy relationships and lead fulfilling lives. As such, the film provides an interesting snapshot of Italy during a time of great transition, as things like the pill and legalized erotica were ushering in an era of greater sexual permissiveness. Despite being marketed as an exploitation film, SESSO instead has a lot more in common with other social issue movies of the time than an Ernst Hoffbauer jiggle opus. It still feints in that direction, but clearly is thinking deeper, and a more somber tone to match.\n\nUnfortunately, the film - at least in available versions - never fully achieves its ambitions. It&apos;s erratic in the extreme, hopping from confession to confession and enactment to enactment with little structure or rhythm, and interspersing its interviews rather arbitrarily. Perhaps there&apos;s a more integral Italian edit that makes better sense, or maybe it&apos;s just an artifact of the &apos;70s and You Just Had to Be There, but the result is muddled and confusing, an interesting attempt at something different (and more substantial) that nevertheless fails to make a compelling or cohesive argument.",

It&apos;s not going to be fun to watch for anyone who knows about Von Richtofen , but it is just a film after all and does provide excitement and enjoyable drama so it definitely is worth giving a watch. It is quite similar to the battle of the bulge film in the sense it tramples all over historical events in order to create a better and more exciting story. Unorthodox but still a good film.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow! I really got lucky with this one! A Jean Claude Van Damme film released in theaters for the first time in the United States since 1998 if memory serves right! A very limited release mind you, but he&apos;s finally made it back to the big screen! It hasn&apos;t been advertised here at all which is a shame because Assassination Games is an excellent film! So where do I begin? Well, the film was shot for $4,000,000 dollars in some Eastern Block country which would normally scare me, but it actually ends up looking a lot better than the above stated price tag. Say around the 15 to 20,000,000 dollar range. The camera and editing work was very well done and the musical score is excellent, non pervasive and flows with the movie in a non intrusive way that adds to the dramatic effect instead of taking away from it. The story is pretty well done. I&apos;d give the dialog a solid B for an action movie and there were no detectable plot holes that I could find.\n\nThe best actor in the film in my opinion was probably Andrew French who plays Nalbandian who plays Devil&apos;s Advocate to Van Damme fallowed by Maria Kaijan, Jean Claude, Scott Adkins and Ivan Kaye. In fact, the acting was pretty much all the way around solid except for the interpol agents who&apos;s dialog and delivery was extremely weak.\n\nThe film goes about 50/ 50 on the action to drama ratio. It drags a bit after the first 5 minutes or so but the fight scenes are interspersed throughout the film well and are also followable which is more than I could say for some larger budget films like the Transformers franchise and I would definitely have to say that Jean and Scott make an excellent action duo as they have the whole fire and ice thing going.\n\nIf you happen to be within an hours drive of any of the theaters listed on the movie website, go and check the film out. It isn&apos;t as good as JCVD or the new Universal Soldier, but it&apos;s a very close third. So go check it out or just wait for the DVD. It&apos;ll be worth it! Thank you Jean Claude! I never thought I&apos;d see you on the big screen again!",

Sa Majesté Minor proves to be mostly funny but I feel now it should have geared into something still crazier at some point halfway through the movie.\n\nWould it have been too easy, too mundane to let Minor become a fully fledged tyrant? To let him become a political beast, and leave behind gradually his buoyant humane bestiality? Eventually I am a bit disappointed Gerard Brach&apos;s last story is not more of a fantastic fable. As such the movie is a pagan tidbit while I think Brach could have made it a universal tale. JJ Annaud too could have make this story take off instead of sealing off narration in and around the -almost Gallic- village. Moreover I think the narration titles are ugly, they do not make up for the lack of a comic chorus that would have bound the story together.\n\nIn a nutshell let&apos;s say Minor is a nice character, nice to a fault since the movie aims to keep the same comic pace all along while the story seems to require a change in rhythm.",

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t seen the first film, so I had no idea it was a found footage film. The first thing you need to even start liking such a movie is to have a liking for the found footage genre. If you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t enjoy it, no matter how good the movie is. Having seen all four Paranormal Activity films and one or two other found footage films, I was prepared for what was coming, so I didn&apos;t expect a good acting to begin with. I knew it was going to be shabby and sound amateurish, because a found footage film is supposed to be like that. Professional performances would be a drawback for this genre, as it is intended to be make-belief. That being said, you can&apos;t really complain about &quot;bad acting&quot; in this movie. After all, it is a plus.\n\nThe most annoying thing about this movie however is that it takes too long for the good part to start, but when it does you&apos;re in for a half-scary half-laughable ride. The movie was a success at conveying the sinister nature of the ghosts beautifully. The shaky camera was a little over the top for my taste. It actually gave me a headache. They didn&apos;t have to pull the wall-cameras off to capture everything on their shoulders. That would have been the solution for too many unnecessary shaky shots.\n\nI liked the role the cop played in the movie. I liked the sudden deaths. Some of them were too violent for a ghost story, but I&apos;d rather see it as an attempt at being scarier. The last 20 minutes was a drag. They should have cut the inessential scenes. For a found footage film, I think it was above average. It had its moments, its thrills, and its flaws, like any other horror movie. Keep your expectations low, because making a satisfying horror movie is a real challenge these days. I haven&apos;t seen any good horror movies in 2012 or in 2011 for that matter. The horror movie industry is dying and that&apos;s a bitter truth we horror movie fans have to face.",

There&apos;s also some interesting additions to the mythology where belief vs atheism is concerned. It all makes for a very entertaining sequel full of many familiar and proved effective Hammer staples, with several new ones as well.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Lasse Hallestrom&apos;s best films.  It is a richly textured, completely unique character study of a youngish woman named Renata, played superbly by Holly Hunter in what is arguably her best performance.  Renata comes from a close Italian family outside of Boston, and has drifted from job to job without much confidence or direction.  Her family is very supportive of her, but rather than drawing strength form their support, Renata seems to dwell safely in it, choosing to let them be her safety net. \n\n Renata goes on a weekend junket where she is recruited to take a position selling timeshares in the Caribbean.  While she is there she meets Sam, the dynamic and aggressive top salesman, who impresses her greatly when she hears him speak.  A flirtation develops, and she ends up traveling back to Boston with him.\n\nThe brash, confident Sam clashes inadvertently with her family&apos;s more traditional and reserved style, and while it is evident Sam is crazy about Renata, the family has reservations about him.  A compelling and utterly captivating story ensues, which unlike most small films, takes major risks, and allows every character to be completely human.\n\nThe story deals with the power of acceptance, of love, of the magic and complete idiocynracy of personal connection, and of what it means to be alive and human.  Sam is difficult--he is over the top, and loud, and exhausting.  Yet the film is equally balanced in showing his many kindnesses to Renata and her entire family; his generosity, his love for her, and his pride that she loves him.  Their love is peculiar and inexplicable, and yet they complete one another in that indefinable way that epitomizes the mystery of love.\n\nit&apos;s not a sappy love story.  The movie shows people warts and all, and loves them anyway.  All the characters are respected.  By the end, I am usually in tears.  Renata tells her parents, &quot;This is MY adventure!&quot; and when you watch this, I think you will agree.",

      "reviewBody": "I am watching the DVD of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; for the first time. I originally saw this film as a child, during its theatrical run. Even though I have watched the P&amp;S VHS tape many times, the DVD takes me back to that unforgettable first viewing so many years ago. This film is the definitive example of how pan and scan (laughably called &quot;fullscreen&quot;) is nothing less than a desecration of the work of those who make movies. Thank goodness there is finally a faithful transfer of this unforgettable story.\n\n I love movies, some much more than others. Even in the films that I love the most, the ones I consider &quot;the best&quot;, I can always find flaws or weaknesses. I can not find a single thing to criticize in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;. The cinematography, as many others have noted, is exceptional. The detail of the sets, the ship, the costumes, the panoramic vistas, all are very convincing. As Crenna points out in the DVD commentary, there is no visual trickery, everything on the screen is real and three-dimensional. I have not read the source novel, and I am woefully ignorant of the political realities in China in this period, although I understand that the book was based on real incidents. The fact is, the story told here is compelling, and it does not matter to me how true to history it is, the world depicted in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is real and believable. Robert Anderson&apos;s script provides sufficient grounding in the political events to keep the audience engaged, without becoming all awkward exposition or political treatise. Of course, the characters express certain strong views, and therein the conflict arises.\n\nRobert Wise is a first-rank director (&quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;), and his work here is superlative. This film is a blend of epic-scale scenes and intimate, poignant moments of emotional realism. The camera placement, the use of extras and props, the blocking of the actors, the use of natural light, the tracking shots of the boat, all are in service of the story. Wise lets that story breathe and the characters emerge, and the result is a three-hour movie. How ironic that the main criticism leveled at &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is that it is &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;. Excuse me, but this is called &quot;character development&quot;, and it sets compelling moviemaking apart from the mediocre variety. The pacing is what draws you in to this world, where the actors can give their characters life and create empathy in the audience. I can only feel sadness for the modern, ADD-afflicted viewer who is trained to respond to manipulative tricks, and can not appreciate a realistic depiction of human behavior.\n\nMuch has been said in these comments about the acting, and I agree with those who feel McQueen and Crenna stand out. The character of the captain could have been a rigid cliche, but Crenna gives us a person, a man to whom duty and service is everything, yet who is keenly aware of the needs and temperament of his crew, and who yearns to leave his mark in history. As for McQueen...his physical presence dominates the film. His understated style is perfect for Holman, a man who only wants to be left alone to do his work, and yet who will fight against injustices done to others. His facial expressions, especially in his eyes, allow us to share his thoughts and feelings throughout the movie. \n\nThe most memorable element in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; for me is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. Alternately stirring and heartrending, it complements each scene absolutely brilliantly, and is the most evocative score of any motion picture I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the 1966 Oscar went to &quot;Born Free&quot;, a mediocre picture whose title song was a hugely popular hit.\n\nI feel privileged that I was able to see &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; in a theatre, where it is meant to be seen. This DVD version finally does justice to what I regard as an unparalleled achievement in filmmaking. There are other films that I have a stronger attachment to for various reasons, but none of them hit a home run in every department the way that &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; does.\n\n &quot;Water belong dead stim -all same dead stim&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Soderbergh is a really odd director. His movies have run the gamut from the wacky, self indulgent surrealism of &apos;Schizopolis&apos; to the pandering, sell-out mediocrity of &apos;Ellen Brockovich&apos;. He&apos;s really hard to get a handle on. &apos;Out Of Sight&apos; was stylish with an outstanding cast but left me cold. &apos;Traffic&apos; featured a handful of great performances, most notably Benicio Del Toro&apos;s, but was overall simplistic, unconvincing and cliched. For my money his strongest achievements to date have been  his overlooked noir-ish &apos;Underneath&apos;, and this, his involving revenge drama &apos;The Limey&apos;.\n\nTerrence Stamp, a fine actor who has appeared in more than his fair share of bad movies, really takes this role and runs with it. He radiates dignity and power as Wilson, the English career criminal out to avenge the death of his estranged daughter. My only problem with his performance, and the movie as a whole, is his Cockney accent, which borders on caricature. If you can get over that hurdle you&apos;ll be impressed by the depth of his performance.\n\n Peter Fonda, who has never impressed me much as an actor in the past (not even his much lauded role in the overrated &apos;Ulee&apos;s Gold&apos;), is also fine as the sleazy record producer who Wilson suspects of wrongdoing. Stamp and Fonda obviously relish playing these characters, and their chemistry together is the cornerstone of the movie. Both actors are supported by an impressive array of old and new faces - including a surprisingly effective Lesley Anne Warren (her best since &apos;Cop&apos;), the always watchable Luis Guzman (&apos;Boogie Nights&apos;, &apos;Carlito&apos;s Way&apos;, etc.), blasts from the pasts Barry Newman (cult classic &apos;Vanishing Point&apos;) and Joe Dallessandro (former Warhol superstar), and future star in the making Nicky Katt (&apos;Strange Days&apos;, &apos;SubUrbia&apos;).\n\nSoderbergh cleverly uses footage from Ken Loach&apos;s kitchen sink drama &apos;Poor Cow&apos; for flashbacks, and plays upon Stamp and Fonda&apos;s 60s screen personas, but the film is no exercise in mere nostalgia. &apos;The Limey&apos; is a rarity in Hollywood these days - an intelligent, thoughtful, well crafted and acted adult movie. I liked it a lot."

Once the story is set up, the action is non stop with a lot of &quot;Edge of your seat&quot; scenes. Cuba &amp; Skeet deliver some good comedy lines to take a bit of the edge off the intensity of this film. Their relationship as friends grows throughout the movie so it gives you a good feeling &amp; brings some believability to how they react to each other in tough situations. If you like fast, hard hitting action with a bit of humor thrown in, this movie is for you!",

      "reviewBody": "Prepare to hear whining and complaining from movie critics who fall outside the boundaries of this movie&apos;s target demographic by a good 15 - 20 years: &quot;This is so predictable!&quot; &quot;What a bunch of clichés!&quot; &quot;We&apos;ve seen it all before!&quot; \n\nYou know what? I&apos;m not going to argue with those points. I don&apos;t deny that this is a by-the-numbers sports drama. &quot;You can do it&quot; speeches fill the air, inspirational music soars high, and anybody well-versed in this genre can easily call the shots. Come on, did you really doubt that there&apos;d be a jerk opposing player that we&apos;d be forced to hate? Are you naive enough to wonder if he&apos;ll get his comeuppance by the movie&apos;s end? \n\nGridiron Gang is a movie that understands who its audience is, and it plays them like a fiddle. But you know what else? I don&apos;t care. The audience absolutely loved it. Biggest crowd reaction of any movie I&apos;ve seen so far this year. They cheered when the gang got a touchdown, they grimaced at every painful tackle, and they chanted for Johnny Betts to take his shirt off. Hey, I thought it was a little out of place as well. But who am I to deny my fans? \n\nNow I&apos;m not saying this is a movie of the year contender, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I&apos;m not ashamed of that, and I&apos;m not going to apologize for it. I&apos;ll even go so far as to admit that there were a couple of scenes during which I got a little choked up - the only time it&apos;s happened this year.\n\nYeah, I said it. You got a problem with it? My biker boots (size 11) and I would be more than happy to discuss the issue. If you can turn an indifferent eye to the scene near the end involving Rock&apos;s mother then you, my friend, are a cold, cold man. Or woman.\n\nWhat can I say? I&apos;m a sucker for inspirational sports movies, especially when they star an actor I like - and I really like The Rock. His charisma and natural screen presence are undeniable, and he even displays some impressive acting chops here. The man gives us real tears - from BOTH eyes. Take that, Ashley Judd! \n\nNot every film has to be a deep, insightful masterpiece of epic proportions with layers and layers of social commentary and &quot;vertiginous fluidity.&quot; Some movies are simply made to entertain. What&apos;s wrong with giving the audience something to cheer? You know, there are still a few moviegoers out there who want to go home happy and inspired.\n\nIf you fit into that category then you won&apos;t have any problem ignoring the familiarity of Gridiron Gang. The wonderful mixture of humor and drama will suck you in and have you rooting for these kids to overcome the odds.\n\nIf you&apos;ve got a &quot;Mr. Potter heart&quot; then do us and George Bailey a favor and stay home. The theater will be more pleasant without your curmudgeonly ways.",

He was delivering a baby cow in a stall when he received the news of being appointed the political head-leader of the Pogradec district (a higher rank than a city-mayor). (The reader should be reminded that Socialist Albania chose its leaders from the midst of the working people, who were to lead when called upon). So, the hard-working veterinarian (Timo Flloko) reluctantly accepted the calling (for he loved his job and loathed the office life away from the working people, blah-blah-blah).\n\nOnce in power as the district head-leader, he was approached at once by a host of his friends and relatives who demanded favors from him. At first he gave in, though against his wish and what was &quot;right&quot;. Some of the favors were: request to transfer to Tirana, to move from the village to the city, for an apartment, and so on. In other words, the people of his family and his friends were keeping him under siege, the small siege. The intervention of an honest peasant (Kadri Roshi), an elder who meant a lot to the now-leader, brings him to his senses. \n\nThe movie was beautifully done with scenes from the city of Pogradec and of lake-shore of Ohrid Lake.\n\nAltin ---",

We go behind the scenes of Elton Johns life when he is on the road , with his family and partner and when he is relaxing at home or on Holiday.Some of the scenes are quite revealing and show us what the man is really like. We see his sensitive side along with his spoilt moody side. I Cant help thinking that i would really have like to see the uncut version of this because it is edited by his partner and so does not really show the dark side of the man and lets face it that what we all want to see when we watch films like this. The thing that really strikes me in this movie is the obscene amount of money Elton spends and ultimately wastes on personal possesions but having said that i still like the man and his music. 7 out of 10.",

I found the movie reveting.\n\nI saw some comments about &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, and the comparison.  A more apt comparison would be, I believe to &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.  In the same sense, perhaps not as musical though, the story seems to weave through the life and times of a community facing oncoming winds of change.\n\nIn a way, with the arguments of the imitation Nazis, and the &quot;revolutionary&quot; communists, the pattern of life is both touchingly human, and comically sarcastic of how men are &quot;seemingly&quot; separated with each other.\n\nAlthough the Jewish communal environment seeps through the wonderful story, the later union with the gypsies who are also seeking a haven, relents to truly human and comic parody of the WWII era."

      "name": "a mystery of happenstance - and a matchless masterpiece at that",
      "reviewBody": "To say the most important thing first: &apos;All about Elly&apos; requires unmitigated attention from the viewer. I actually watched it in the Berlin Festival last year, but didn&apos;t think too much of it as I was distracted. Since it won the Silver Bear and was voted by Iranian critics the best national film ever, I decided to give it another shot on DVD, and as it works sometimes, I realized that this film is not only a true gem, but one of those rare, timeless classics that may help to explain to posterity the reality of generations past.\n\nWhat lulled me into a mistaken sense of boredom upon my first viewing was the unassuming start of the film. The simplicity of the plot - a group of young Tehrani couples going on a seaside weekend trip, with one of the wives trying to act as a matchmaker between a female colleague and an expat on vacation from Germany - is presented in such low-key fashion that if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s coming (and I didn&apos;t) it&apos;s hard to focus on the subtle hints of possible conflict. Also, while I&apos;ve been to Iran and consider myself vaguely familiar with the complexities of life there, of course as a mere visitor you can catch but a fraction of what things mean, and since this is very much a jump into an unknown society, you really have to blank your mind to catch the drift of what the characters say.\n\nIronically, that&apos;s a stark contradiction to the usual Iranian festival fair: Kiarostami works a lot with metaphor (which he often endlessly repeats to drive the message home), Panahi with situation developments (which he exploits to the utmost degree to drive the message home), and therefore their works do not require much background info, though it sure helps. Farhadi&apos;s film asks for a bit more audience participation, as much of the conflict in the second half of the film stems from Iranian social reality, I would think. That is what, on my second viewing, convinces me of the timeless quality of this film: never before have I seen a director pull so much substance out of so little plot and setting.\n\nJust because &apos;All about Elly&apos; appears to be simple at first, it is actually really deep; once I suspected that every frame in this film means something and is not just there, I entered an alternate visual language, which then communicated the urgency of what Elly&apos;s disappearance meant to me. I felt that this film thereby manages to tell me emotionally what I could rationally never fully comprehend: what it means to actually live in a country like that. No other film from Iran has ever done that for me, and I&apos;ve rarely seen a film from another culture that managed to do so. So I would assume that Farhadi has taken directing to another level here.\n\nWhat&apos;s more: this isn&apos;t just a very artistic way to convey a message, it&apos;s also very entertaining. For once I was drawn into the characters, their sense of alarm and suspense kept me on the edge until the very end. There&apos;s a decent dose of Hitchcock in &apos;All about Elly&apos; as unreal as that may sound. That&apos;s the real charm of this film: although it&apos;s demanding in terms of familiarity with the setting, it&apos;s international in its depiction of emotions anyone from anywhere can relate to.\n\nIn conclusion: Definitely not to be missed if you are just as much as remotely interested in Iran, or have a sweet tooth for excellent direction (though the French term &apos;mise-en-scène&apos; hits the mark in this case). This is the kind of movie that should become part the curriculum of film students around the globe.",

Harrowingly violent scenes may make this film tough to watch for some... but Harris gives one of his usual great performances and the movie provides an atypically (for its time) sympathetic depiction of the Native American people.  Much more realistic but just as sincere as that other 70s classic &quot;Little Big Man.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Oh dear lord, this was hilarious. It was so bad and so full of errors that it was actually a great joy to watch. It was just one mistake after another, and for me it grew into a sport to spot the goof and errors in this movie. And trust me, there is a lot!\n\nFor starters when the very first thing appeared on the screen was The Asylum, then I knew this was going to be one of those movies. Yeah, you know which ones I am taking about, because The Asylum trademark is founded upon these laughable low-budget disaster (and monster) movies. And &quot;Air Collision&quot; is no different, and why should it be?\n\nThe story is about two air planes on a collision course with one another; one being a commercial carrier and the other is none other than Air Force One itself. Indeed, how very original. But it gets better, because everything that can go wrong, will go wrong in this movie, and that is what makes it so darned hilarious. The story itself is actually entertaining enough, that much credit should be given to The Asylum, but for everything else, well it is just a standard run of the low-budget disaster movie mill.\n\nAs for the cast tied into this movie, well initially I think people were doing an overall good enough job with the acting, given the material they had to work with. So it was not on this aspect that the movie was halting.\n\nAnd as we all know (and love) about The Asylum and their movie productions, then they enjoy taking the same scene and show it repeatedly through the feature. And true enough, the same goes for this movie, a lot of repeated usage of the same footage over and over. Classic The Asylum stuff right there.\n\nThen let&apos;s move on to some of the glorious mistakes and goofs throughout &quot;Air Collision&quot;. For starters, the questionable CGI effects with the faulty satellites, that was just amazing. Especially because they all were faulty and fell down from the skies, most of them managing to strike populated areas, oddly enough, wonder if they had some kind of guidance system for their crash course. But questionable CGI is sort of part of The Asylum&apos;s trademark productions, so let&apos;s not linger too much about that.\n\nWhen Dr. Antonia Pierce (played by Erin Coker) scaled the fence and was stopped by a soldier, that was just priceless. Let&apos;s back it up a notch, there was nowhere in the vicinity that the soldier could be hiding (or lurking), and yet the good Antonia couldn&apos;t see him, but immediately as she set foot on the ground he magically appeared and arrested her. That had got to be some impressive camouflaging on his part.\n\nOr during the scene where the commercial airline had it&apos;s hull ripped open, and the people on board it managed to seal the massive gap in the hull with duffel bags and hand-carry trolleys. Wait, what? Seriously? Yeah! Seriously!\n\nYou just got to love the menacing sky that turns all purplish-pink with constant (and repeated footage) lightning over and over. But then in the next scene it is a clear blue sky with lazy clouds, but then later on turns back to purplish-pink. Pick one and stick with it already!\n\nAnd lets not forget about the bearded hippie-like passenger with the headband who was sucked out of the air plane when the roof was missing, nothing wrong with that as per se. But then a couple of scenes later he was back in the plane, sitting comfortable in his seat. What the... So he was sucked out of the air plane, went for a spin through the air and miraculously returned back to the seat? How is it even possible to make a mistake like that?\n\nAnother of my favorite goofs was when Bob Abbot (played by Reginald VelJohnson) and his intern made it to the Cleveland Museum of Aviation and could just walk around there undisturbed by neither other visitors or guard personnel, and better yet, go up and start using, modifying and tinkering with museum exhibitions without anyone raising any objections, questions or even asking what was going on, that was just priceless. So no one except those two were at the museum? Yeah, that seems likely.\n\nAlright, well aside from all these really, really bad mistakes and goofs, then &quot;Air Collision&quot; is not amongst the worst of movies to have been produced by The Asylum. And that being said, should actually weigh heavily in the mind of those familiar with their previous work.\n\n&quot;Air Collision&quot; is far from a super great movie, but there are far worse and more ridiculous disaster movies available out there. This movie is worth watching, I suppose, if you are just laying about on the couch with no energy (possibly nurturing a bad hangover) and just want something silly to laugh at and be mildly entertained by.",

      "reviewBody": "I am abhorred that the Oscars could ignore this film for all the categories it so well deserved:\n\nBest Actress (Kirsten Dunst) Best Actor (Edward Herrmann) Best Costume Design Best Cinematography\n\nAnd those are just the obvious ones!\n\nPeter Bogdanovich is one of my favorite Directors. He has an amazingly vast Encyclopedia of knowledge about Hollywood during this time. He was good friends with the master Orsen Wells and even did the Commentary for Citizen Cane in Wells&apos; place. He was unquestionably the perfect Director for putting this story to screen.\n\nKirsten Dunst is remarkable playing 24 year-old Marion Davies at only 18. She does a superb job in the role and deserved a lot more attention than she was awarded.\n\nI strongly disagree with comments that the supporting cast was bad. Everybody was perfect for their role! The sax player WAS a sax player (not an actor) from Berlin (where most of the movie was filmed) and he did fantastic! (He only had one line for goodness sake!)\n\nThough I would concur that Jennifer Tilly played Louella Parsons a bit unlike we would expect, I support her decision to treat her this way for the sake of this film. She lightened up the film with her bumbling silliness. So what if Lolly wasn&apos;t like that in real life? It worked well for the movie.\n\nMy only (slight) complaint was the decision to have one of the flappers briefly flash us (show her chest) during a party scene with her, the other flapper, the sax player and Chaplin. It was unnecessary and felt out of place with an otherwise clean movie. My guess is this was the reason for the PG-13 rating.\n\nThere is hardly any language - in fact Bogdanovich changed the film&apos;s only F-word to &quot;screw&quot; to clean it up even more than the original script. This works much better for the period than filling it with 21st century language.\n\nAnybody interested in the 20&apos;s, William Randolph Hearst or &apos;The Golden Age of Hollywood&apos; MUST see this movie!\n\n8½ out of 10. (I can&apos;t decide between 8 and 9!)",

Boris Karloff plays the scientist Janos Ruhk who travels with a band of other scientists to Africa for the spot where an unidentified element landed centuries ago.  Karloff is very good as the scientist who accidentally poisons himself with this new radioactive element.  Karloff is obsessed with the idea that his fellow travelers, amongst them the stately Lugosi as Dr. Benet, are after his honors and secrets of this new find. Because of this, Karloff goes on a maniacal murdering spree of his former friends.  There are many good elements in this film, most dealing with the rather interesting story of science gone amok.  Lugosi is good too, although his role is not very big.  I must agree with many that this pairing of the horrific duo is a second to The Black Cat.  Nonetheless this is a fine Universal science fiction/horror film."

(1951) classic, the 1935 Scrooge, A Christmas Carol (1938), the Bill Murray - Scrooged (1988), the Patrick Stewart TV Movie - A Christmas Carol (1999) (my personal favourite) and the Jim Carrey animated version from 2009 are all better, much better in some instances, usually modern versions even try to be like the 1951 version since that is the benchmark.\n\nThe story line is excellent of course, but the screenplay on this one has rather spoilt it and the acting although not too bad, does not make up for the other shortcomings, I don&apos;t know whether this was someones idea to try to make a good version of the classic story or just an attempt to jump on the band wagon to make some quick bucks, but from a viewers point of view, why watch this version when you have several much better films of the same story.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of A Stranger Is Watching. Before we get into it, here are my ratings:\n\nStory - 1.25 Direction - 1.25 Pace - 1.25 Acting - 1.25 Enjoyment - 1.25\n\nTOTAL - 6.25\n\nBased on a Mary Higgins Clark novel, A Stranger Is Watching is an insidious dark thriller. The one thing that stayed with me was how cold-hearted and viciously cruel the killer was. Granted, that&apos;s par for the course in this style of story. Though, what makes Artie Taggart stand out is the gritty realism of his character. Artie wouldn&apos;t stand out in a crowd as a man to worry about. In fact, most of the time it&apos;s Artie who is marked as a target by other criminals. Usually to their detriment. Even if he loses the fight he wears his scars and bloodstains with an apathetic pride. It takes the writers, the director, and the actor to construct Artie into the human monster that he is. And they all do it superbly.\n\nThe one good thing Stranger has going for it, and what caught my attention, was the director, Sean Cunningham. He of Friday 13th fame. This guy knows how to use his locations to the max. The murder at the beginning takes place in a large sitting room by a roaring open fire. Though, when he shows Julie, the daughter, witnessing her mother&apos;s abuse and murder, you can&apos;t help but feel trapped and claustrophobic. He shoots Julie behind the bannister of the stairs. It looks as though she&apos;s imprisoned with nowhere to run. And, of course, her fear has done just that. Then when we get down under Central Station, he shows the audience a darker and dirtier side to the city. Discarded rubbish is left to rot in the enclosed tunnels, where the lost, homeless, and rats roam. It&apos;s an ideal place for a villain&apos;s lair. Who in their right mind would venture down there?\n\nAs for the performances, as I said before, Artie Taggart is the foremost character. And boy, was I surprised by this because he is played by Rip Torn. He is one actor who never made it onto my radar because he&apos;s never been so good. If I had watched stranger when I started watching movies seriously, I would have hunted out Rip Torn movies. Only to be let down. Rip Torn in this film is like Ted Levine as Gumb in Silence Of The Lambs.\n\nHowever, the rest of the cast is a tad hit and miss. The worst is James Naughton as the kidnapped girls&apos; father. He is so laid back it&apos;s unforgivable. His wife was murdered, and then the last of his family was abducted, surely, he would be out of his mind and pulling his hair out. But this dad is so cool, you can call him SMEG.\n\nNevertheless, A Stranger Is Watching is an above-average and enjoyable dark-thriller. If you like your bad guys dark and deadly then this film is for you.\n\nFeel free to check out my Killer Thriller Chillers lists to see where I have ranked A Stranger Is Watching.\n\nTake Care &amp; Stay Well.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the questions arising after watching &apos;Brief History of Disbelief&apos; is the choice of its title. It is deeply ironic in the sense that the movie is neither &apos;brief&apos; nor even historical. Instead the documentary is a long 3 hour opinionated ramble with no historical time-line and little educational value.\n\nThe movie starts with an attempt to show that theistic beliefs are inferior to other forms of beliefs including what the narrator insists on calling &apos;knowledge&apos;. The presentation fails on both counts of clarity and accuracy. It is not clear since it uses jargon borrowed from Philosophy of Mind which can be both misleading and incomprehensible for the general audience. It lacks accuracy, since the narrator displays blatant ignorance of the subject and contradicts general consensus achieved in Epistemology, i.e. that it is almost impossible to demarcate between rational and irrational not only in our daily lives and folk beliefs, but even when it comes to scientific methods. For anyone interested in the subject, an introductory course in Philosophy (specifically in Metaphysics, Epistemology, or Philosophy of Science) can present a coherent contemporary view on the topic.\n\nThe rest of the movie marks some change from dogmatic philosophizing in its first hour. However, it is equally disappointing and it fails to deliver on the promised &quot;history of disbelief&quot; as it neither provides a satisfactory theory about the origins of atheism nor does it give a coherent hypothesis of why it became so dominant. Instead, the narrator picks up a famous historical figure, examines origins of her personal anti-Christian convictions, and then moves on to another random famous person. As a result it is not surprising there is hardly any structure to this presentation.\n\nPerhaps the most entertaining aspect of the movie is continuous interjection by the second narrator with an anti-religious witty joke or poignant remark made by some historical figure. Clearly these jokes are not picked up for their intellectual qualities, but rather for their emotive appeal. They are as vaguely offensive to theists suggesting their weak-mindness as they are vaguely self-congratulatory to atheists on the similar ground. However, since theism (a belief that there is god) and atheism (a belief that there is no god) are both mere beliefs, there is really no rational basis for these self-righteous overtones. Once this is sorted a funny analogy appears. It&apos;s an analogy between the ATHEISTIC rant of the narrator in &quot;Brief History of Disbelief&quot; and the THEISTIC rant of, say, Pat Patterson on Christian Broadcasting Network. Both are religious crusades which are offensive to the other camp and congratulatory to yourself.\n\nFinally, it must be mentioned that the lack of any cinematic account on the history and nature of non-theism (and specifically atheism) makes the failure of this documentary particularly disappointing. It could have been the first attempt to explore this philosophically, historically, and sociologically fascinating subject. Unfortunately, it is not. It is just a misdirected effort by a layman director with little education on the subject and strong anti-Christian convictions.\n\n2/10 for a couple of interesting references, otherwise 1/10.",

The movie has strong performances from Reynolds, Keith Carradine,and Pat Hingle. The mountain setting is beautifully photographed, several nude scenes are tastefully done, and the musical score is exceptional. The story of an overprotective and evil mountain man trying to dominate everyone, while steadily losing control, is compelling. &quot;The Hunter&apos;s Moon&quot; definitely qualifies as a true &quot;sleeper&quot;. Graphic violence is interspersed with moments of &quot;dark humor&quot;, but the movie never veers from it&apos;s well rooted lovers on the run story line. All I can say is if you can find it, see it! - MERK",

MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt&apos;s life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt&apos;s dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt&apos;s super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn&apos;t have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It&apos;s a good movie to pass your time.",

With that said, Citizen Toxie is one of the best independant films I have seen to date.  It&apos;s a classic horror comedy with a superhero twist.  Nudity, gore, and violence.  Whats not to like? In my opinion, director Llyod Kaufman gave fans of the series what they had wanted for years.  After Toxie II and III (which were suppose to be one movie but due to its length was made into two) this movie is a welcome return to what made the first Toxic Avenger an instant cult classic."

      "reviewBody": "This movie will stand as a functional litmus test for years to come. People will be able to see how others react and measure them by their reaction.\n\nFor there is no doubt that this is one of the worst movies ever made. It could be signed Ed Wood but it&apos;s too poor for even that - it&apos;s more like artificial wood.\n\nIt&apos;s always hard to single out one culprit when a movie is so painfully embarrassingly poor as this one, and to concoct a product in this extreme category takes the contributions and lack of talent of thousands. Was it the writer? Undoubtedly. Was it the idiot who came up with this idiotic story line? Assuredly? Was it the direction? What direction? Was it the editor? Yes - but what material did the editor Julian Rodd have to work with? And so forth. Everyone can be blamed, and anyone can point a finger at someone else - and they should have been doing a lot of that by now.\n\nYou will search long and hard for a movie as amateurish as this. Not only is there no continuity in the storytelling, the editing looks like it&apos;s been done by an orangutan drunk on absinthe. And when I say bad, you&apos;re probably thinking, &apos;oh that bad is it?&apos; but you would have missed the point. For it&apos;s worse. Whatever you&apos;re thinking or imagining, think and imagine worse - far worse - and still you won&apos;t be close. Did they ever get away with things like this in your kindergarten film school? Nope - kids this bad, be they only 3 - 5 years old, were sent home to their parents and put on bread and water. Get the picture now?\n\nIn fact the only redeeming feature of this movie - and the only reason we were able to view it and thus review it - was the head of the cast Natasha Wightman. You might recognise her from that horrible adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express from a few years back. The one where Hercule plays with a laptop computer for hours without a battery, without any physical connection to anything, and still basically gets flash-class graphics back that explain the entire story to him. Even Google can&apos;t do that. At any rate, Natasha was Mary Debenham, the part played by Vanessa Redgrave in the original (and far better) movie, and she&apos;s a lot easier to look at. In fact, Natasha is a &apos;dish&apos; and the people behind the camera really know how to make her look good - and she really does look good. Of course you&apos;ll find her coiffures absolutely impossible given the circumstances she&apos;s supposed to be in, but that&apos;s the kind of movie you made the mistake of renting. Caveat emptor.\n\nPS. You&apos;ll find another reviewer here who says the movie was &apos;well researched&apos;. Remember: it&apos;s a &apos;litmus test&apos;. And that reviewer&apos;s test came out the wrong."

      "reviewBody": "Home is a documentary about Earth, humanity, nature, where we&apos;re going and what we&apos;ve been. Shot in 54 countries with aerial footage it&apos;s a combination of all the navel-gazing movies we&apos;ve seen lately like Planet Earth and Baraka. Like a guilty abusive adult, we&apos;re now taking a closer look at ourselves, what we&apos;ve done to the planet and what we&apos;ve to ourselves.\n\nThat&apos;s in large part what the first 3/4 of the movie is about. Showing different locations on Earth, the stunning gliding shots of our planet&apos;s more beautiful locations as well as the terrible damage we&apos;ve caused. In that way it&apos;s much different than Baraka and Planet Earth, the two films I compared this to. This movie talks about humans, not just their achievements but the economic chaos we&apos;ve wrought on each other.\n\nThe vast differences in class structure in the west from the east. The vast amounts of wealth owned by 2% of the population. Starvation, disease, war, are all covered in this documentary. It&apos;s not just about the nature but the capitalist system which has destroyed the planet and brought humanity to its knees.\n\nMany of these changes have occurred in the past 50-100 years. Vast change which is increasing to the point where urbanization is epidemic all over the planet. The melting icecaps are also covered in very nice detail. The consequences are of course very grim. Some of this information I knew but it&apos;s good to be reminded how we live in the western world which is rapidly destroying the planet and taking all the innocent passengers along with us.\n\nThe movie was released on the internet, television and internet on the same day. It&apos;s on YouTube in its entirety, but I downloaded a high quality version from One Big Torrent which was very nice to watch.\n\nProbably one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the best documentaries of the year as well. I highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was rather interesting and surprisingly so. I had expected a mediocre movie at best, so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhat made this movie have a big impact, is the fact that things similar to the events in the story actually do happen from time to time in our messed up society. Just take the school shootings from USA or Finland for example. Uwe Boll played his cards well in this movie, and delivered somewhat of a social and political heavy set movie here.\n\nThe acting was sparse, and wasn&apos;t really needed in a movie of this type. But the lead role played by Brendan Fletcher was remarkable. He put on a stunning performance with his psycho role.\n\nNow, the only thing that kind of irritated me in this movie was the hand-held camera stuff. That was horrible. Had Uwe Boll decided to go with a steady cam instead, the movie would have been just that much more cool. Sure, hand-held cams are nice as well, but it was just a tad too much in this movie. Every single shot was shaking back and forth, often to a degree where you started to pull your hair and scream &quot;keep it still, for the love of Hollywood gods!&quot; But looking past the camera issue, then this movie rocked phenomenally.\n\nThis is most definitely a movie to check out. It is packed with action and at the same time taking on the gloves to punch our sick society in the face.",

The singer takes refuge in an inn run by a hospitable but creepy innkeeper who became psychologically upset with the villagers after his wife left him. The innkeeper offers to repair the singer&apos;s van as a token of brotherhood between professional entertainers.\n\nThe next morning when the singer tells the innkeeper that he is going for a walk, the innkeeper suddenly becomes paranoid and aggressive, warning the singer not to go into the nearby village.\n\nThe movie has tons of atmosphere but is very claustrophobic, surrealistic n horrifying at times.\n\nThe bar scene where outta blue the people starts dancing with one another is downright creepy.\n\nThe backwoods village without a single female character and not a single sane male character is an epitome of eeriness.",

I&apos;ve never seen an actor parade like he does in this movie... The soundtrack is a wonderful thing too,it&apos;s painful and happy at the same time. It always does harm my faith of this world&apos;s bigness. It&apos;s a tough-provoking fine piece of work, in my opinion. I was at school, named after Saint Filippo Neri, so it reminds me to my childhood, and it&apos;ll remind You, to whatever you enjoyed in your childhood.",

      "reviewBody": "I wonder, as I write this, why a film like Ondskan hasn&apos;t received commercial distribution in the States. Perhaps distributors assume Americans are too removed from the world of mid-century upper class boy&apos;s boarding schools in Sweden to relate to the film, which is our loss. Ondskan presents a microcosm of cruelty, status, and one-upsmanship - one might say evil - that exists in such an institution. Every year we read another horror story of a hazing gone too far. Children trounce their playmates. There&apos;s plenty of physical aggression among boys. The latest discussion concerns what among girls is called relational aggression, in which an individual is harmed through the hurtful manipulation of peer relationships and/or their friendships. .Neal LaBute has taken the idea of sadistic relationships to the American workplace in &apos;In the Company of Men&apos; and to the suburbs in &apos;Your Friends and Neighbors&apos;. There have certainly been other films tackling this particularly subject of sadism in boarding schools, Young Torless  (Der Junge Törless) in 1966, comes especially to mind. What is captivating about Ondskan (&apos;Evil&apos;) is both cinematic and psychological. The world of this o-so reputable boys school is painted in earth tones and fine wood with muted light rendering its cold emotions. The set design by Anna Asp (who&apos;s has done some other great looking films) lets us feel as though we have lived in this space. The lead character, Erik Ponti, at first we think will be the embodiment of the &apos;evil&apos; of the title. He is regularly and systematically strapped by his stepfather. He transfers that frustration to his own classmates, which is what gets him sent to the boarding school in question. There he is ritually brutalized by the upperclassmen, which is, we are led to understand, the expected behavior in this hierarchy. To the administration and faculty this is apparently part of school tradition. Eric&apos;s initial unwillingness to fight back, despite a similar unwillingness to bend to arbitrary, sadistic, and unwritten rules, is relentlessly frustrating. As an audience we really want him to act. But his honor, his fortitude, and the fact his mother has hocked some heirlooms to pay tuition, keep him from lashing back. We are thus submitted to the same unremitting abuses with no real payoff. I will refrain from revealing the end, but it is not when or what you might expect. The result is a great ride and an elating experience. The audiences at Harvard, where I saw the film, applauded afterward. It&apos;s not a perfect film. There are clichés and expected set-ups. Still the mushy adolescence of the actors cast in these parts is consistently smart. The music is tasteful and well used. The direction is subtle and the violence is felt more than seen, but when it happens it is as ugly as it deserves to be."

      "reviewBody": "Following on from Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero, this latest feast for the eyes from Andrew Lau sees Ekin Cheng once again as the hero. This time his adversary is Andy Lau. With perhaps a little less action than its two predecessors, The Duel focusses on the drama surrounding events in the days leading up to a duel between two master swordsmen.\n\nWhen Holy Sword (Andy Lau) challenges Simon the Snow Blower (Ekin Cheng) to a duel on the roof of the Imperial Palace the imagination of the people is captured leading to much excitement and anticipation. Dragon 9, the emperor&apos;s secret agent is entrusted with choosing eight individuals worthy of witnessing such an event. However a couple of days before the duel there are some mysterious murders and Dragon 9 turns detective as tries to discover the identity of the killer.\n\nThe mood of the movie is much lighter than the other two with more comical asides included in the dialogue thus keeping it interesting in the long gaps between action scenes. Despite there being less actual fighting in this movie the action, when it comes, is quite thrilling and some of it rather beautifully put together. Andrew Lau is not afraid to try out new techniques and the opening scenes in particular contain some very interesting sequences reminiscent of the Matrix. When the duel finally does happen it is the special effects spectacle you would expect but with enough attention given to the swordplay.\n\nAlthough Andy Lau and Ekin Cheng are the two biggest stars of the film, most of the screen time is given to the Dragon 9 character (don&apos;t know who plays him) as he tries to solve the mystery. Andy and Ekin just seem to pop in every now and again until the end of the film when the actual duel comes to the fore. Its this aspect that gives the film an air of originality in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward plot unfortunately their characters aren&apos;t really given that much opportunity to develop so come the end you don&apos;t really care that much which of them actually wins.\n\nIf you didn&apos;t enjoy Storm Riders or A Man Called Hero then you&apos;re unlikely to like this very much. For me it sits somewhere between the two (Storm Riders being the worst).\n\nRating 3 out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Il demonio&quot; follows Puri, a young peasant woman in a small Italian villa who is obsessed with Antonio, a married man. Puri&apos;s sickly fixation on Antonio leads her to practice witchcraft in an attempt to direct him to her, but instead, she becomes subject of a witch-hunt when she becomes apparently possessed.\n\nThis obscure Italian shocker predates mainstream possession film such as &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (by ten years!), and, while it is not as gratuitous as that film or the others in its wake, &quot;Il demonio&quot; is no less a powerful, artful exploration of obsession, superstition, and evil. One of its most intriguing components is that it consistently toes the line between &quot;is it real?&quot; and fully committing to being outright supernatural--at times, it appears that perhaps Puri is being persecuted for her zany (though ostensibly harmless and ineffective) attempts at witchcraft--at others, however, the reality of the situation is not so clear.\n\nIn either case, the character of Puri is a tragic one, as her mental illness is either misunderstood, or, perhaps, leads her to fall prey to a demonic force. Daliah Lavi&apos;s performance as Puri glues the film together, as she is both tragic and pitiful--Lavi&apos;s acting never goes too far over the edge, but it comes tantalizingly close. The film is further bolstered by its gorgeous, expressionistic imagery, with stark black-and-white photography pinning the characters against vast landscapes, at times resembling something you might see in an Ingmar Bergman feature.\n\nThe screenplay does feel a tad clunky in its final act, but its resolution brings it full circle in a befitting (albeit downbeat) manner. All in all, &quot;Il demonio&quot; is a powerful film that consistently leaves the audience turning it over in their heads. Ambiguity is very well utilized, and Lavi&apos;s riveting lead performance is key--be it a case of the psychological or the spiritual, &quot;Il demonio&quot; is potent no matter how you read it. 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to seeing this film and it did not disappoint. Although Happy Feet Two was not as good as its Oscar-winning predecessor, there were still plenty of toe-tapping moments. I liked the fact that the songs were recognizable. I am sure that L. L. Cool J is just tickled pink that they included his &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;. In this film Mumble (Elijah Wood) is all grown up and learning how to be a better father to his son Erik (Ava Acres). Erik was just the cutest little thing and he pulls at your heart-strings right from the beginning. The main story line was a good one, but I think that I found the story between Bill the Krill (Matt Damon) and Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) even more entertaining. Those two had their own thing happening. I liked the way that the writer (George Miller) had two stories going on at the same time and the fact that they blended together in the end was excellent. I think that you have to have a lot going on to keep the attention of kids these days. I did not see this film in 3D, but you could tell by some of the scenes that the price of a 3D ticket might have been worth it for this film. The animation in this film was simply stunning. Animation has come a long way since Casper the Friendly ghost (I&apos;m dating myself, huh?) Anyway, it was great. It was also refreshing to see the development of numerous female characters in this film such as Gloria (Pink) and Carmen (Sofia Vergara). I have to give props to the ladies. Robin William&apos;s character, Ramon had me cracking up throughout the film. It is not surprising that Robin really knows how to make his characters stand out since he has done numerous voice projects in the past (Genie in the Aladdin films, Dr. Know in A.I. and Fender in Robots). This film contains numerous life-lessons that I think that the target audience will understand (one person can make a difference, keep your promises, don&apos;t run away from home, etc.). If you enjoyed the first Happy Feet, then you will also enjoy this one (just not as much). Anyway, I say put on your dancing shoes, shake a tail feather and go out and see this film. I am giving this film a green light."

      "name": "Nice Franco film revolving around a Police Inspector goes after a nutty doctor , Orloff , who kidnaps beautiful women from nightclubs",
      "reviewBody": "Moody terror movie about a mad doctor who removes the faces of gorgeous girls and attempts to graft them onto the ruined head of his disfiguring daughter . Early XX Century at a French town called Hertog , the police officer Edgard Tammer (Conrado San Martin) is assigned by his chief (Felix Dafauce) to investigate a case about missing women . Thanks to the help his girlfriend , the Opera ballerina Wanda (Diana Lorys) , discover the real culprit results to be Dr. Orloff (Howard Vernon) , who is assisted by the creepy blind servant Morpho (Ricardo Valle who has a magnificent make-up) , a deformed monstrosity who delights in biting his victims and sadistic practices . Orloff is a veteran Prison doctor who attempts to remake the bruised face of his injured daughter (Diana Lorys in double role) using skin of young girls .\n\n Austerily wonderful terror film that contains thrills , chills , haunting poetic fantasy and deemed to be the first movie of the ¨Spanish Fantaterror¨ . In this enjoyable as well as eerie flick , Franco established his uniquely poetic and visually striking style , tough imitating to classy &quot;Eyes Without A Face&quot; (1960) , the masterpiece directed by George Franju . This splendid Spanish/French co-production is generally characterized by unforgettable images that owed a great deal to early cinema in general and German Expressionism in particular and turns out to be a symbolic attack on the ethics of science . Although the film passed European censors upon its original release in 1962, the disturbing facial surgery scene still caused controversy, existing a double version , both , a light Spanish and another hard French one . It was reported that several audience members fainted during the surgery scene . Nice acting by Howard Vernon as a former prison doctor who tries to use their skin to repair his beloved daughter&apos;s fire-scarred face and whose role subsequently to show up in various flicks . As Vernon is brilliant as a demented researcher/scientific/surgeon haunted by past tragedy who takes girls removing their faces and attempts to graft them onto the head on his wounded daughter . Acceptable acting by Conrado San Martin as the hero Inspector who figures out the killings . And a lot of gorgeous girls as Diana Lorys , Maria Silva , Mara Lasso and Perla Cristal . And brief appearance , as usual , by Jesus Franco or Jess Frank as a pianist at a bar . \n\nFifth film of the prolific writer/producer/director Jesús Franco , considered to be one of the best films in his first period . Well produced but in short budget by the Hispamer/Sergio Newman and the French company run by Marious Lesoeur : Eurocine . Stunningly filmed in black and white by cameraman Godofredo Pacheco , using continuous raining , lights , shades and expressionist darknes . Shot in Madrid of the Austrias , posing as the fictitious French town of Hartog . This classic terror motion picture , a classic in some circles , was well directed by Jesús Franco who never considered the film to be a horror story, but instead felt it was tale of &quot;anguish&quot; . Franco is really influenced by ¨Eyes without a face¨, B-movies about cops or Noir Films , German expressionism from Cabinet Dr Caligari , and the Universal Terror . Initial releases of the film were met with negative reactions from film critics , while the general critical reaction had been poor , however ,today is considered to be a pretty good fim. \n\nThe Orloff character starred a saga , using the same shots in more than one film ; some of his actors relate how they they were hired for one film and later saw their name in two or more different one . Orloff was habitually played by Howard Vernon who initiated in ¨Gritos en la Noche (1962) , the best of all them , also titled &quot;The Awful Dr. Orlof&quot; . It&apos;s followed by El Secreto del Dr. Orloff (1964) aka &quot;The Mistresses of Dr. Jekyll&quot; - USA . It&apos;s gone on by &quot; Orloff y el hombre invisible (1970) aka &quot;Dr. Orloff&apos;s Invisible Monster&quot; , ¨Ojos siniestros de Doctor Orloff¨(1973) . Furthermore , El enigma Del Ataúd (1969) aka &quot;Only a Coffin&quot; and El Siniestro doctor Orloff (1984) aka &quot;The Sinister Dr. Orloff . Finally in ¨Faceless¨ or Depredadores de Noche¨(1987) Orloff appears as a secondary role also performed by Howard Vernon",

I had read the book and in the book nothing is that black or that white for that matter, but this is as movie and as a movie it works. I was expecting commercial interruptions every few minutes, the film felt so much like a TV movie. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The Michael Oher story had to be told even with the poetic licenses that the film takes, shamelessly. Sandra Bullock plays herself beautifully as always and her character with all her saintly stern, southern modern American woman could not move away too far from &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;. But it works and at the end of the day, after paying the prices one pays at the box office, it&apos;s almost enough. Why they had to ruin it with an Oscar nomination? The nomination makes you look for something in her performance that clearly isn&apos;t there. If you go to a Sandra Bullock movie, the quality of the movie may vary but she is always terrific, playing that Sandra Bullock character. Good for her.",

It&apos;s not a film abusive of the people portrayed on it.\n\nIt&apos;s this crazy idea (a script idea that came out of a &quot;dream&quot;) of what would it be like if a town (BTW: Manayaycuna actually means the place no-one-can-enter and is non-existent) believed that during three days there&apos;s no sin, since &quot;God is dead&quot;.\n\nBetter approach it with the motto of &quot;it&apos;s just a film, it&apos;s just a film&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s a difficult film to watch, but, nonetheless, a work of fiction, so don&apos;t take it so personal. Some filmmakers in the world, and some writers -as I do, have found this film remarkable in many aspects.\n\nWhen I read a comment calling names to whoever chooses to watch this film just for that decision... well, that person shouldn&apos;t be allowed to post here!"

First of all, this is one of the best films of 2004, and I hope it gets a wider release in America. Why did the Korean film, &quot;Spring, Summer, Winter, Fall...and Spring&quot; get a significant release in the USA, but &quot;Untold Scandal&quot; has not? &quot;Untold Scandal&quot; is the far better of the two. Secondly, I felt this version of &quot;Dangerous Liasons&quot; was FAR superior to the American version that was made a number of years ago with Glenn Close and John Malkovich. This version was played more as a love story, more of a Shakespearean tragedy, and infinitely more heartbreaking. While all the performances are strong, the woman playing Lady Sook (the Michelle Pfeiffer role in the American version) was by far the most moving of all the performances. As someone noted earlier in their comment, I didn&apos;t see this as a comedy at all. But again, this was absolutely tremendous, and I hope it gets a wider release in America, so that more will have the opportunity to see it.",

It also has great sets, highly visually appealing and suits the tone and setting of the film.\n\nHelen Hunt&apos;s acting is great. She plays a flirtatious woman to a great effect. The plot, though I imagine is not original, has a nice twist at the end that makes my heart warm.\n\nThough set in the 1930&apos;s, the film does not seem over the top in trying to create a retro feel, unlike the other Scarlett Johansson recent film The Black Dahlia. it is comfortable to watch and heart warming."

Great production values. The lead girl looks vaguely familiar and I recognized her sister who is, according to the credits, Missi Pyle, although she&apos;s not listed on IMDb as of my post.\n\nSo if you like a comedy that&apos;s a little on the black side, you can do a lot worse than this.",

      "reviewBody": "Like Josephine Baker and Louise Brooks, Anna May Wong was an American woman who had to go to Europe to find films worthy of her talent. The Pavement Butterfly, a German-British production set in Paris, is by no means a great film, but it provides a marvelous showcase for Anna May Wong, and ample evidence that she would have been one of the top stars of her era if not for the racial prejudice that limited her to &quot;dragon lady&quot; roles in America. Here she is absolutely stunning, going from carnival cooch-dancer to haute-couture-draped rich man&apos;s mistress, with a bohemian interlude in the garret of a starving painter. She proves herself a fine actress as well as a charismatic star, and looks throughout like the proverbial million bucks. \n\nThe film is strong on atmosphere and weak on plot. Settings include a seedy carnival complete with female boxers, the bohemian garret mentioned previously (which looks exactly like the one in Seventh Heaven), Paris nightclubs, and the French Riviera. The cinematography is stylish, with flashy montages introducing the various settings. The leading man (Louis Lerch) is a naturalistic actor and starts out likable enough before metamorphosing into a jerk; Anna May Wong&apos;s rival is a horse-faced, wealthy Daddy&apos;s girl rarely seen without at least one dead animal wrapped around her neck. S.Z. &quot;Cuddles&quot; Sakall, looking uncharacteristically trim, appears as one of the hero&apos;s bohemian friends. The plot is driven largely by a singularly loathsome villain, who seems to be motivated by a combination of greed, frustrated lust for the heroine, and sheer monstrosity. \n\nThe story suffers not only from improbability but from gratuitous sadism towards the heroine, who suffers unjust accusations of murder and robbery. (Maybe the fact that she&apos;s named &quot;Butterfly&quot; should have tipped me off that her fate wouldn&apos;t be happy.) Though little reference is made to her race, it&apos;s hard not to attribute the pervasive suspicion and ill-usage of her to the fact that she is Chinese. And when she winds up alone at the end, I was reminded strongly of the Josephine Baker vehicle Zouzou, in which likewise the gorgeous heroine winds up losing her man to a bland blonde. \n\nI was lucky enough to see The Pavement Butterfly in the Museum of the Moving Image&apos;s current Anna May Wong retrospective (paired with a Josephine Baker retrospective, in which I recently viewed Zouzou), with a large enthusiastic audience and live music. The print was flawless, and I hope this film will be released as Piccadilly recently was, since it, and especially its star, deserves to be more widely seen.",

      "reviewBody": "Enzo G. Castellari&apos;s &quot;1990: Guerrieri Del Bronx&quot; aka. &quot;1990: The Bronx Warriors&quot; is a trashy end time action flick that was mainly produced to cash in on the success of two prior post-apocalyptic cult flicks, Walter Hill&apos;s &quot;The Warriors&quot; of 1979 John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;Escape From New York&quot; of 1981. I have utmost respect for director Castellari for movies such as the great late Spaghetti Western &quot;Keoma&quot; with Franco Nero in the lead, but it &quot;Bronx Warriors&quot; is certainly not one of the highlights of his career. Although &quot;The Bronx Warriors&quot; is overall a silly film that lacks in many departments, it has some qualities and is fun to watch if you&apos;re a fan of apocalyptic 80s trash. The exploitation factor makes it worthwhile, although it could have been higher, since there&apos;s no nudity, and not nearly as much violence as i hoped for.\n\nIn the future (the year 1990) The Bronx is entirely in the hand of criminal gangs. The fight against crime has become so hopeless that the state has decided to keep out of the Bronx and declared this territory no man&apos;s land and people have to kill in order to stay alive in this godforsaken place ruled by hostile gangs. One of these gangs, a biker gang called the &apos;Raiders&apos; are lead by a young guy called Trash (Mark Gregory), who falls in love with Ann (Stefania Girolami Goodwin, daughter of director Castellari) a girl who has fled to the Bronx from Manhattan...\n\nThe main reason to watch &quot;Bronx Warriors&quot; is the great blaxploitation star and badass Fred Williamson, who is once again the epitome of coolness as &apos;The Ogre&apos;, the self-proclaimed King of the Bronx. Another cool role is that of Vic Morrow, who plays a professional gun called Hammer. Other than Willamson and Morrow, and Victor Conelly, who has a smaller role, the performances are pretty forgettable, especially Mark Gregory is rather terrible in the role of Trash. I also found it quite questionable, why the huge, badass bikers with their tattoos and full beards would accept baby faced Trash, who looks like he&apos;s 15 years old as their leader. Some (unintentionally?) hilarious aspects of this film are the ridiculous-looking rival gangs, like &quot;The Zombies&quot;, a gang whose members come on roller skates and armed with hockey sticks, another gang who look like Neanderthals, and another &apos;fearsome&apos; gang of rouged guys who look like ballet dancing drag-queens.\n\nThe great Fred Williamson is responsible for almost all the cool moments in this film, which is otherwise quite forgettable. Nevertheless, the exploitation and trash factor make &quot;Bronx Warriors&quot; worthwhile if you&apos;re a fan of this kind of trashy end-time cinema. Don&apos;t set your expectations too high, and you might have an entertaining time, if only due to Williamson and several bloody fights. Mildly recommended to lovers of trashy 80s stuff.",

The problem is Elling IS mentally disturbed--with a lot of assorted symptoms of various anxiety disorders--plus he&apos;s just plain weird. As for Kjell, he, too, comes from the hospital and both are VERY awkward when it comes to fitting in to the community. What will happen with these two strange men? Will they make it or will they need to return to the hospital? \n\nI noticed that IMDb listed this film as a comedy. I really don&apos;t think it is a funny film, nor does it try to be--but it IS quirky. Instead, I see the film as a nice slice of life. It does NOT make fun of the characters but has a nice affection for them. Overall, an engaging and sweet little Norwegian film.",

      "reviewBody": "As schoolchildren we hear the terms World War &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; -- and then spend the rest of our lives learning why it was called WORLD war. The story is set in the Aegean on the eve of World War I when so many nations lusted to flash their sabers and sound their canons. Ben Kingsley brilliantly plays &quot;Pascali,&quot; a bottom-ranking spy for the Ottoman Empire that, after reigning for 900 years, is about to be annihilated by the war. The name &quot;Pascali&quot; is a reference to Judeo-Christian symbols of the paschal lamb, passover, and so forth, and the story incorporates the encounter between Muslim Turkey and the Greek Orthodox Church. Pascali longs for the attention of expatriate Lydia (Helen Mirren) who, being an Austrian, represents the impending war&apos;s crushing of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as well. Into the lazy sun drenched intrigue of Pacali&apos;s Greek island steps one Antony Bowles (a most poished Charles Dance). A failed archeologist turned world-traveling swindler-sophisticate, Bowles, in classic Anglic fashion, plays the Turks and Germans against one another. (The only thing missing, in terms of dynasties the &quot;Great War&quot; destroyed, is a reference to the Romanovs! But then, actress Helen Mirren is of Russian descent...hmmm.) Even the Americans are involved as distantly glimpsed (for they would not enter the war until 1917) arms merchants. Lest this all seem like a pretentious amount of historical intricacy, &quot;Pacali&apos;s Island&quot; is a modest set piece about a handful of people whose gods have deserted them or never heard their plaintive worshipping in the first place. The blinding glare of the Greek Islands is artistically wrapped like bleached gauze around a mood of sweat-and-ouzo-soaked melancholy. Mature, intelligent, and sensitive, this one requires the viewer to be wide awake. View it perhaps on a Sunday morning while the coffee is fresh. Take from it the line (that means nothing out of the movie&apos;s context)&quot;The error of their ways.&quot; Quality film making!"

      "reviewBody": "A Communist East German production from 1972, this has all the cramped yet lived-in interior spaceship shots, the hardware is a mix of what you see in low budget sci-fi films from a decade earlier, plus attempts at some futurism, as interpreted by Communist central Europeans from the early 70&apos;s- throw in a dash of LSD psychedelia and Gerry Anderson, and you get the picture.\n\nOne unique thing about Eolomea is how it juxtaposes and treats two story lines- one is the space mission and the other is a romance. Both are intriguing and play off the other, there are some very scenic flashbacks, it is a delicate touch between the two and they blend wonderfully. You have the nuts and bolts plot- some spaceships disappear, and &apos;ground control&apos; has to sleuth to get to the bottom of the issue. This investigation is spearheaded by a lovely female scientist... who meets a jaded carefree yet cynical space pilot named Dan, they share some time together. In the end , Dan plays a pivotal role in the finale, one that is bittersweet and quite sad to watch ... yet you sense a playful ruefulness to the concluding action/ decision. This is a thinking mans existential sci fi film, the theme of our aspiration to transcend our limits and the boundaries of knowledge is contrasted with the utter loneliness or even futility of the human dilemma, or, are all these things tied together? 6 + stars.",

This John Carpenterized version is a tad more gory and more colorful than the 1960 version.\n\nThe small town of Midwich one-day falls inexplicably asleep. Many accidents occur due to sudden narcolepsy, which is exaggerated in John Carpenter style. The result is that several of the village females including a virgin are in a motherly way. They all have their bouncing white hair babies the same day and as with the cuckoo eggs, they are too in love to notice the little quirks about having to control or mentally punish everyone. Compound this by other villages that fall to the same fate and you have an epidemic that threatens to wipe out the human race.\n\nWhat action can be taken?\n\nIs it too late?\n\nIf he/she were your child, what would you do?",

      "reviewBody": "In &quot;Hannah and her Sisters,&quot; Woody Allen has created a funny, poignant, and sweet film about three very different sisters. The focus is Hannah (Mia Farrow), a successful actress currently married to Elliot (Michael Caine) and divorced from Mickey (Woody Allen). She&apos;s more of a mother figure to her sisters, Holly and Lee (Dianne Wiest and Barbara Hershey) than their own mother (Farrow&apos;s real-life mother, Maureen O&apos;Sullivan) an alcoholic performer who likes to flirt with younger men, to the fury of her husband. Hannah handles her mother, puts up with Holly constantly borrowing money and then picking fights with her in that mother/daughter fashion, but she doesn&apos;t know that her sister Lee is having an affair with Elliot. And so it goes, as Thanksgivings pass and the women attempt to straighten out their lives.\n\nThis is one of Woody Allen&apos;s best films - I won&apos;t say best, because I love Match Point and Crimes and Misdemeanors more. The humorous parts of the films are provided by Wiest and Allen, and some of the lines and situations are hilarious: Holly and Mickey&apos;s disastrous date (&quot;I had a great time. It was just like the Nurenberg trials&quot;), Mickey&apos;s contemplation of suicide, and Mickey&apos;s fear of a brain tumor. Allen is brilliant as a man who believes he&apos;s living in a godless world but wants to believe. Though Jewish, he decides to become Catholic, bringing home religious info with his mayonnaise and Wonder Bread; when that doesn&apos;t work out, he talks to the Hari Krishna in the park. Wiest is as adorable as she is fantastic as a manic-depressive who goes from acting (including auditioning for a musical when she can&apos;t sing), catering (until her partner, played by Carrie Fisher, steals the man she thinks is her boyfriend), and finally writing.\n\nThe rest of the cast is magnificent and tackle some of the more serious moments of the movie: Michael Caine as Hannah&apos;s husband, looking for love in all the wrong places; Max von Sydow, Lee&apos;s tortured artist boyfriend; and Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O&apos;Sullivan as the sisters&apos; parents, in an imperfect marriage filled with love, booze, and jealousy. Hershey is lovely as a confused woman who adores her sister but looks to Caine for a way out of her relationship with a controlling boyfriend.\n\nThe film, of course, is filled with New York sights and sounds, including Bobby Short (&quot;You don&apos;t deserve Cole Porter,&quot; Mickey screams at Holly. &quot;You should stick with those rock musicians who look like they murdered their parents&quot;), the opera, Central Park, etc., that give Allen&apos;s films their special atmosphere (until &quot;Match Point,&quot; that is, which has a special atmosphere all its own).\n\nA great film with Allen asking again about the meaning of life and, again, coming up with some good answers.",

      "reviewBody": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nThis is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it&apos;s certainly set in the past, and it&apos;s made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it&apos;s about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully.\n\nAnd I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie.\n\nOf course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He&apos;s a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he&apos;s the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you&apos;ll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it&apos;s clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too.\n\nThen there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It&apos;s all rather bold and emotional even though it&apos;s delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico.\n\nAre there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it&apos;s not bad, tinged with clichés, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it&apos;s the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don&apos;t know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work.\n\nI&apos;m sure to some this is a masterpiece. I&apos;m giving that some thought. See it.",

Powerful characters analysis, depiction, a realistic picture of inmates daily life, as if you were yourself in the can. Poignant, engrossing, this movie is really a little gem that deserves one million times to be discovered."

      "reviewBody": "One of the more intelligent anti-Communist movies that came out in the Fifties was Man On A Tightrope, shot in Bavaria as close as 20th Century Fox could get to Czechoslovakia where the story takes place. Fredric March plays the lead, a circus owner who seemingly knuckles under to the new rulers of his country. For that his daughter Terry Moore is concerned with his mental health. His second wife Gloria Grahame thinks he&apos;s become a spineless weakling and starts casting her eyes about the rest of the show.\n\nNot so because March has been ruminating about a plan to get over the border to West Germany and freedom and it&apos;s quite the scheme. But it will involve split second timing and the right opportunity which seems to have presented itself. He does have a traitor in his ranks who reports to the local party things in the performance that don&apos;t quite tow the party line. When local commissar Adolphe Menjou gives March an ideological pep talk about his clown routine, March realizes he&apos;d better flee and fast. \n\nThis film was directed by Elia Kazan who has come down to us sadly as a friendly House Un-American Activities witness and was sadly booed at the Academy Awards when he got a lifetime achievement award. Kazan&apos;s long life ended in irony when Pat Buchanan spoke a eulogy on one of the talk shows. Then as now Buchanan was a guy Kazan would have despised, he always considered himself a man of the left.\n\nBut in his theater days he saw just how rigid and ideological Communists can be. I&apos;ve long been convinced that each and every person who appeared at HUAC, friendly or hostile, each did it with his own motives and agenda, some good, some evil. Adolphe Menjou for instance was a rabid rightwinger who left a nice size bequest to the John Birch Society. His agenda was different certainly than Kazan&apos;s.\n\nMore than On The Waterfront which has come down in film history as Elia Kazan&apos;s apologia for being a stool pigeon, Man On A Tightrope is a far more personal work. March is playing Kazan as artist resenting any political intrusion of any kind in his work. Unless you realize that this film will have no meaning.\n\nKazan assembled a truly good cast and got some great performances, especially from Fredric March. Man On A Tightrope should be seen by today&apos;s audience for a real understanding of the era and of Elia Kazan.",

However this is done in great theatre style well worth checking out if you are a horror/thriller genre fan. Ally Sheedy gives a great preformances going away from comedy and into serious here",

      "reviewBody": "Following weakly on the heels of Bridesmaids is this other bridesmaids movie. It kind of sucks for the writer/director Leslye Headland, in that it&apos;s based on the play she wrote several years ago (and she likely already had the movie deal before Bridesmaids appeared). Even if it was beaten to the punch, though, it&apos;s not very good. The film follows three high school friends (Kiresten Dunst, Lizzy Kaplan and Isla Fisher) who gather back home for the wedding of another friend (Rebel Wilson). All three of the bridesmaids have pretty cruddy lives, and they&apos;re upset that their less attractive, fatter friend is getting married before them. The night before the wedding, on a coke binge, the three tear Wilson&apos;s wedding dress and then have to scramble to repair it. The thing that will put most viewers off of this film is that the three leads are just awful, petty people. Many of the supporting characters (notably James Marsden and Adam Scott) are even more despicable. You have to wonder how these people are friends with the bride and groom in the first place. I did think, after a while, they characterised the three women enough that we at least understood why they were so screwed up. There are a handful of funny moments. Any small bit of goodwill it had built, though, was jettisoned by its ultra-lame rush-to-the-wedding finale, and then a particularly painful and miscalculated post-wedding toast where Adam Scott tries to hook back up with Caplan, who was his high school girlfriend. The film&apos;s really just not worth sitting through.",

The premise is OK and even the beginning is not completely horrible, but then the action get relentlessly repetitive as are made character is chased and chased and chased some more, which does work for me at times but with nothing unique thrown in there to mix it up a bit then it just gets old fast. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, not only a twist but a twist that makes a little sense and actually works, it doesn&apos;t feel contrived and just thrown in at the end to screw with the audience. If your looking for a good horror movie you could do much better, but if you can stomach Pinks horrible attempt at acting for the length of this film (more power to you) then you could give this one a try, but only for it&apos;s unique ending.",

      "reviewBody": "Les Blank has a rarity here that might have one of the best titles I&apos;ve ever heard, or at least the most original. Garlic is as Good as Ten Mothers is a 50 minute excursion into the world of those who love, cherish, sing, cook, grow and pick and know a good deal about that most polarizing of seasonings and produce. As someone observes, making a dish that has a plentiful portion of garlic will bring out a reaction, and be it good or bad is what making something worthwhile is all about. In that sense garlic is its own cult, but one that already has a strong base of fans in Europe, slowly growing in America (this is 1980 of course, if these figures have changes in 28 years I can&apos;t say). What Les Blank gets on film is compelling and fun because he presents people who are passionate, and his camera probes in extreme, artistic close-ups into the preparations of unusual culinary feats, sometimes involving pigs and chickens, other times with dishes that look close to brains or vomit. Yum! \n\nLike his Burden of Dreams, Blank has a knack at getting into the little things in a subject and making them paramount (where he found interesting insects and things in the making of Fitzcarraldo, here he has a fascinating at times with musical instruments that are played at garlic festivals). Granted, there is an occasional obnoxious voice-over which explains some of the history of garlic, including its origins and how widespread it is in America (2nd only to black pepper). But it&apos;s enlightening to see so much of this, like a cooking show that&apos;s given a slightly skewed perspective, loaded with folk songs dedicated to garlic, interviewees like Herzog himself, crumbs and specs and things that fall like they&apos;re meant as snowflakes through the compositions. It&apos;s oddball and and always loving, including a cool finishing touch of how garlic is farmed and packaged. If you love garlic, or just like some of Blank&apos;s films, it&apos;s worth checking out.",

The arrival of everyone&apos;s much loved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton, in his favorite role) is the catalyst to disaster, with eldest daughter Charlie in particular welcoming the arrival of her affectionate namesake as a relief from the humdrum routine of suburban life. But evidence soon begins to suggest the elder Charles might actually be a cold-blooded serial killer, and a lethal game of charades begins between uncle and niece: she knows the truth, and he knows that she knows the truth. The tension builds to an alarming climax, in a trademark sequence (another one for the Hitchcock highlight reel) showing the Master of Suspense at the top of his form. The film was shot in sunny Santa Rosa, California, where the shadows are darker because the sunlight is so much brighter.",

The film also stars Eli Wallach, Hugh Griffith, Charles Boyer, and Fernand Gravey. Hepburn plays Nicole, the daughter of a renowned art collector, Bonnet (Griffith), who in fact is not a collector but an expert forger. He has lent his famous Cellini Venus to the Paris Art Museum, only to find out that before it can be insured, there will be a technical test to assure its authenticity. Since it&apos;s a sculpture, and the chemical makeup was different from the material in the 14th century, the forgery will be easy to detect.\n\nIn order to help her father, Nicole Bonnet contacts Simon Dermott {O&apos;Toole) whom she caught when he broke into the house she shares with her father, and asks him to steal the Venus from the museum.\n\nIn the &apos;60s, caper films were all the rage, and it would be hard to miss with two such beautiful and sophisticated stars as Hepburn and O&apos;Toole. Their chemistry is great, the caper is clever, and the dialogue is witty. The supporting cast is excellent; someone said Eli Wallach was miscast as an obsessive collector. Originally Wyler cast George G. Scott, but he was replaced when he arrived on the set late. Scott would have been more tycoon-like.\n\nLike bubbly champagne, &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; tickles and delights throughout.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "name": "Frank Buck and early sensitivity to nature and the environment",
      "reviewBody": "Seventy years ago, big-game hunting was still considered a heroic and thoroughly admirable endeavor. The slogan &quot;bring &apos;em back alive,&quot; adopted by Frank Buck, was an important turning point in this period, popularizing ideas which are far closer to today&apos;s notions of environmental protection. Buck was a businessman, who by the 1920s developed a thriving trade bringing animals back from Asia and selling them to the zoos of the United States and Europe. With the onset of the Great Depression, Buck, like many others, went bankrupt, but this opened up a new and far more important part of his career. Buck turned his real experience of capturing wild animals into a series of articles for magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post and Collier&apos;s. This led to a contract for a book with Simon and Schuster, entitled Bring &apos;em Back Alive, that became a runaway best seller. Bring &apos;em Back Alive remained steadily in print for more than two decades, and the phrase that would always henceforth be associated with Buck&apos;s name. With the success of the book, Buck moved on to his long-standing dream of making jungle pictures, inspired by a desire to improve on the films of Ernest Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper. However, Buck had difficulty interesting a major studio in a movie version of Bring &apos;em Back Alive; he found it far easier, he recalled, to get an audience with the ruling maharajahs of India than the movie moguls, who saw no possibilities in animal films. Finally Van Beuren Pictures, a producer of shorts releasing through the new Hollywood studio, RKO, agreed to back Buck for an expedition to the Malayan jungles to produce thirteen short films. Shooting in Malaya, Sumatra, India and Ceylon, for nine months, Buck found that the animals themselves made up the story regardless of plans. Upon returning, Buck convinced Van Beuren that the footage could best form a feature-length movie, and in 1932 BRING &apos;EM BACK ALIVE became one of the most popular pictures of the year. Buck proved not only to be a raconteur on the printed page, but with his experience on the stage and as a showman from his youth capably played the starring role and proved the perfect narrator. He introduced the picture personally to audiences during its New York first run. Just as the success of the book prompted a follow-up, entitled Wild Cargo, by 1934 a second picture was produced under this title, shot in Ceylon, Sumatra, Malaya and northern India. This time, the emphasis on battles between animals was replaced with the ingenious methods used to capture them, and WILD CARGO was again profitable. Buck was very much a man of his time who embodied many of the attitudes of an era. There are occasional lapses from today&apos;s perspective, such as the references to his native assistants as his &quot;boys&quot;a problematic designation he does explain in his books. Parts of his documentaries were indeed staged, but no more than was usual then, or now, to reconstruct actual events. Overall Buck promoted a sympathetic understanding of Asian wildlifeand people--at a time when both were still a novelty to Western eyes.\n\nBuck&apos;s third book was entitled Fang and Claw, concentrating on the people of the far east that he had known, and in 1935 he directed a film of the same title that had little in common with the book. In contrast to the excitement of the first two movies, FANG AND CLAW was less spontaneous and planned to concentrate on the more prosaic aspects of Buck&apos;s business. Censors had clamped down on scenes revealing the violence in the animal kingdom. However, these same aspects caused FANG AND CLAW to be the first of Buck&apos;s films promoted to youth as learning tools by the National Education Association. It was the first of several Buck projects to reveal an increasing emphasis on the importance of children and fictional elements to Buck&apos;s audience, and he began to appear in films directed at this audience. By this time, Buck had secured a firm position as an American hero. The market offered Frank Buck medals, letter openers, pith helmets, giraffe pins, rings, neckerchiefs, brooch and jewelry, bracelet, knife, soap, pencil boxes, watches, and games. His endorsement was sought for such products as tires, guns, whiskey, food, automobiles, toys, clothing, and cigarettes. In addition, he told his stories over the radio, and was portrayed by actors on the air. He was also back in business importing animals for zoos. Buck could be seen in person at circus performances, and mounted important exhibits of his live animals, most notably at the 1939 World&apos;s Fair in New York. He went on the lecture circuit with his documentary footage. What makes his utilization of all these media all the more amazing is that he was a commodity, rather than a producer or distributor, such as a Walt Disney, in a time when different media outlets were all separate companies.\n\nIn 1948 RKO reissued BRING &apos;EM BACK ALIVE and Buck&apos;s career underwent a brief renaissance. That year, Buck returned to his hometown of Gainesville, Texas, to dedicate the Frank Buck Zoo, still the only existing memorial to the man and his work. By then, however, he was in failing health, and died in 1950 at age 66. Despite all the dangers Buck found himself in, his life ended not because of any wild animal, but from lung cancer caused by decades of cigarette smoking. Buck and his slogan of &quot;bring &apos;em back alive&quot; were an important part of introducing two generations to progressive ideas about the environment and the animal kingdom. His stories remain just as enjoyable as ever, and an anthology of the best of his writing was published in Buck&apos;s home state by Texas Tech University Press. Through his use of a multitude of media, including writing, films, radio, circus appearances, and exhibitions, Buck was an icon who epitomized an intelligent and conservation-minded interest in the wildlife of Asia."

I&apos;m used to watching Diane Keaton playing this type of character, but in this case she really overdid it (may be the Director&apos;s fault, who knows). An outright terrible performance is made by Anthony DeSando playing the son/sidekick/whatever of Sorvino&apos;s character. The part in itself is exceptionally stupid (very cliché), but DeSando manages to make the character appear so stupid, that it isn&apos;t even funny (which I believe it was intended to be).\n\nBob Balaban (as Keaton&apos;s brother), Burt Young (as one of the persons she&apos;s asked to kill) and sometimes also Maury Chaykin makes the last half the movie somewhat tolerable, after 40 minutes of Keaton freaking out all the time.\n\nThe movie isn&apos;t exactly terrible, but it is the worst Diane Keaton-flick I&apos;ve seen for some time."

      "reviewBody": "I have made no secret of intensely disliking most of The Asylum&apos;s movies, but there is something about their awfulness that intrigues me into watching more of their movies, also to see if they&apos;d make a decent movie. So far there has been four of their films that are better than you&apos;d expect, but they are still average. Which is more than I could say for Legion of the Dead, which is down there with their worst. The two leading ladies are beautiful and there is one mildly amusing line, other than it is utter drivel from start to finish. It is very poorly made, I have seen better camera work from our camcorder at home, while the scenery is tacky, the lighting dull and the special effects really fake and cheesy-looking. The music and sound effects have a tendency to drown out the dialogue and they are far too obvious, when something &quot;scary&quot; happens they single-handedly ruin the suspense and scare-factor these scares ought to have. The dialogue apart from one line is so corny it makes your ears cringe with embarrassment, while the story, aside from that it is very formulaic- takes far too long to get going and never gets exciting or suspenseful. The characterisations of the mummies are frustratingly inconsistent, either make them rip out body parts with one hand or make them annoyingly ineffectual, but please don&apos;t make them have both, with more emphasis on the latter. The human characters are stereotypical and are not likable in the slightest, and beautiful eye-candy unfortunately doesn&apos;t equal good acting, which is what is severely lacking in Legion of the Dead. In conclusion, the only thing really that is scary about Legion of the Dead was how truly awful it was. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

      "name": "Pollack on Gehry: An Intimate Dialogue Between Friends Yields True Insight Into the Architecture Icon",
      "reviewBody": "Even though I have since seen the Experience Music Project in Seattle and the Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago, I was first taken by Frank Gehry&apos;s work when I accidentally came upon the eye-catching &quot;Fred and Ginger&quot; building in Prague in 1999, an eccentric juxtaposition of a cylindrical concrete building and a free-flowing glass tower that does indeed look like the classic dancing pair. Director Sydney Pollack has taken time out of his commercial film-making to make a mostly winning documentary about his close friend, the world-renowned architect. It&apos;s a warm and low-key look at Gehry&apos;s creative process which obviously parallels Pollack&apos;s own. In fact, the film is structured as an intimate conversation between the two and the joy of the film comes from the unexpected revelations that only happen between friends, in particular, how Gehry broke with tradition at an early age to design wildly original buildings that people either abhor or revere.\n\nWith a relative minimum of his own narcissism, Pollack is able to convey Gehry as a curious mix of self-effacing outsider and proud non-conformist and uses not only Gehry&apos;s own musings but the perspectives of others to provide evidence of both sides of the man. Not too surprisingly, Gehry&apos;s long-time therapist Milton Wexler provides the most perceptive comments about his patient&apos;s internal creative struggles, but there are also insightful remarks from Gehry&apos;s colleague, the late Philip Johnson; Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times; and architecture critic Hal Foster, the only one to offer a dissenting view of Gehry&apos;s work.\n\nUnfortunately, in an attempt to broaden the audience for his film, Pollack has also included several celebrities, whose opinions about Gehry border on the banal, for example, film industry heavyweights Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner and Barry Diller; Dennis Hopper who lives in a Gehry-designed house; and Bob Geldof who just happened upon Gehry&apos;s to pass by the Vitra Design Museum while on tour. Director Julian Schnabel provides some funny moments as he shows up in a bathrobe, sunglasses and with a brandy snifter, especially as he talks about the audacity of Gehry&apos;s work and makes a classic analogy with Robert Duvall&apos;s performance in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.\n\nHowever, the best moments are Gehry at work with his design partners Craig Webb and Edwin Chan, as they innocently start designs with construction paper and a pair of scissors. Pollack&apos;s cinematic skills come into play when he showcases the designs of Gehry&apos;s most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in LA and the DG Bank Building in Berlin. With long takes and compositions set against adjacent buildings, we can appreciate what Gehry was trying to achieve in making his designs compatible with the environs. Instead of the montage provided in the film, a more comprehensive and annotated image catalogue of his work would have been more helpful in order to understand the changes in Gehry&apos;s designs as his career progressed. Other than previews for several recent documentaries, the only extra on the 2006 DVD is an illuminating half-hour Q&amp;A session with Pollack moderated by director Alexander Payne.",

The film doesn&apos;t show them as saints, just as real people with real stories and almost all fed up with society patronizing them. Ultimately the film packs a real emotional punch and will likely get you wanting to know more about many of the people you meet here and what happens to them after the credits roll. It may even inspire you to watch this sport live if you get a chance to do so or at least follow it. I hope this film gets the release it deserves as I think it has serious breakout potential. Based on its&apos; award at the Sundance Festival in 2005, positive word of mouth could be considerable. 9/10"

Sybylla grows to understand that life is a series of trade-offs, and that no one can have it all, and that no one can please everyone.  Simple yet universal themes told with charm, wit, and a vulnerability that allows us to get right inside of her character and to understand her --- up to a point that is, a career is vital but I don&apos;t believe I&apos;d have the strength to pass up Sam Neill under any circumstances, especially as cute as he is in this movie.  In fact, all the acting is great, and the cinematography is breathtaking.  Gillian Armstrong has been my idol ever since she made this magnificent film.  I give it a 10."

      "reviewBody": "Clint Eastwood made his directorial debut with this 1971 suspense/thriller, `Play Misty for Me,&apos; in which he also stars as Dave Garver, a late night radio disc jockey for a small station in Carmel, California.  During his show, he opens the phones to take requests, at which times a frequent caller-- a woman named Evelyn (Jessica Walter)-- always asks for the same tune, `Misty.&apos;  Her obsession, it turns out, is not with that particular record, but with Garver, who is currently sorting out a relationship gone bad with a young artist, Tobie (Donna Mills), but which may be on the mend in light of the fact that Tobie has just returned to town after a lengthy absence in the wake of their breakup.  In the interim, Garver has become entangled with Evelyn, a fan he soon discovers gives new meaning to the term `fanatic.&apos;\n\n\tEastwood invades Hitchcock territory with this film, which it turns out was indeed a harbinger of the course his career would take from this point on, that of directing and starring in his own movies.  With this one, it&apos;s apparent that he had that special touch from the beginning; he knows unequivocally what he likes, what works and how to deliver it.  The only weakness in the film (if you can even call it a weakness), would be the use of longshots during a couple of scenes between Garver and Tobie that take place on the coast.  It adds a scenic vista for a backdrop, but listening to the dialogue with the actors in the distance gives it a dialogue-added-later feeling.  It&apos;s a minor flaw, however, that takes nothing away from the overall impact of the film, especially as Eastwood establishes a deliberate pace that allows the tension to mount throughout.\n\n\tIt would seem that for an actor to direct himself would be a monumental undertaking, especially the first time, but Eastwood proves here what has been corroborated over the years and with his films since, that he is his own best director.  And it&apos;s a club to which few actor/directors belong, which puts him in the elite company of Welles, Branagh and most recently, Ed Harris (with `Pollock&apos;), just to name a few of the select.  As Garver, a minor celebrity whose biggest fan turns out to be his worst nightmare, Eastwood is thoroughly convincing, and though this may not be one of his most memorable roles, it is certainly well acted, and delivered with that subtle Eastwood charm.   \n\n\tJessica Walter combines just the right amount of beauty, charm and menace for her role of Evelyn, which just may be her most memorable performance ever.  She creates a character who is smoothly confident, if slightly vulnerable, and prone to instantaneous bursts of psychotic anger.  It&apos;s an honest portrait of an extremely disturbed individual with the ability to conceal the true nature-- and danger-- of her mental state.  Exceptionally well realized by Walter, Evelyn could be the older sister of Stephen King&apos;s Annie in `Misery,&apos; a role for which Kathy Bates received an Oscar for Best Actress some twenty years after Walter inhabited the body of Evelyn.\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes John Larch (Sergeant McCallum), Jack Ging (Frank), Irene Hervey (Madge), James McEachin (Al Monte), Clarice Taylor (Birdie) and Don Siegel (Murphy).  A film that will have you on the edge of your seat by the end, `Play Misty for Me&apos; withstands the test of time and works every bit as well today as when it was originally released.  A tale from the dark side, it&apos;s engrossing entertainment that may give you second thoughts about that casual acquaintance you&apos;ve just invited to your house for dinner.  Eastwood chose a perfect setting for his film, using one of the most beautiful spots along the California coast as a background against which to contrast the grisly events of the story.  It all adds up to a wild ride for the audience, and an auspicious debut for Eastwood as the Man Behind the Camera.  I rate this one 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the best selling novel by Harlan Coben this is how a thriller should be made. If you thought Jack Bauer had bad days wait till you meet Dr. Alex Beck (played superbly by Francois Cluzet) the film starts with him along with his wife spending sometime by a lake when she and then he are attacked, she is murdered and he is put into a coma. Skip eight years into the future and although never forgetting his wife&apos;s memory he has to a certain extent rebuilt his life. Then things start to turn, when two bodies are discovered buried near the lake and certain evidence suggest a link to Alex and the unsolved case of his murdered wife, suddenly it looks like he is in the frame, again. Then Alex begins to receive e-mails from an anonymous source at first but which seem to be coming from his wife, could she still be alive? And if so what the hells been going on? At 2hrs 11mins this isn&apos;t by any means a short film but it is handled so well by director Guillaume Canet that not once did I even notice the time, from the moment the story hooks you it never lets go right up to the end. As Alex starts to dig deeper and deeper to try and uncover the truth you are with him all the way discovering things as he does and when the whole thing finally unfolds it really is quite breathtaking. This film for me had everything, a brilliant script, a seasoned cast, twists and turns, Jeff Buckley&apos;s &apos;lilac wine&apos; used to amazing effect (you will know what I mean when you see it) stunning cinematography, complex subplots that never once get too confusing, it truly is one of the most enjoyable and intelligent films I&apos;ve seen for a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven&apos;s managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that&apos;s a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right. Honestly speaking, there aren&apos;t too many surprises to be had in Scream 4. No matter how mordantly self-aware the movies are (and believe me, Scream 4 gets a little tediously indulgent in its postmodern cleverness), there&apos;s an inevitable predictability to some of the proceedings but anybody who&apos;s a genre-savvy horror fan will appreciate how brilliantly everything is executed. The opening sequences, for example, are one of the best parts of the movie and are a perfect reintroduction to the franchise and while the bulk of the story lags a little, it&apos;s redeemed by the ballsy ending.\n\nThe acting is great with the core trio (Campbell, Arquette and Cox) delivering their usual, strong performances and the rest of the cast, however limited their respective roles, are just as entertaining. All you TV buffs there will get a kick out of seeing actors from Heroes, Veronica Mars, True Blood, Mad Men and Community share the silver screen and camp it up. More importantly, the film is hilarious and just a whole lot of ridiculous fun. Craven isn&apos;t afraid to take the story to some beautifully insane places and the ending was, to me, perfect. \n\nAll in all, it&apos;s a great, irreverent slice of horror that&apos;s hilarious and true to the franchise. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Here we go again. The Blind Dead return and this time they are holding a coastal village in a grip of terror - demanding a virgin to be chained up on the beach for seven days in a row, every seven years. Why? Don&apos;t ask me, and definitely don&apos;t ask that nice couple that have just moved in because they&apos;ve obviously not seen the previous three Blind Dead films. Lucky escape for them when it comes to the third one.\n\nYou see the guy is the new doctor in town but the locals don&apos;t seem to like him or his wife, right down to plain acting as if they weren&apos;t there! The couple find this behaviour rather odd but what I found rather odd was that the new doctor had never checked out the place he and his wife were moving to and instead just turned up one day not knowing anything about the place they were staying in?  What these two quickly find is that the villagers are too scared to stand up to the Blind Dead, and that they might be a bit short of virgins, or is that young ladies? When I think about it I&apos;m not quite sure it was virgins they were after. Why am I overthinking this?\n\nYou can guess what happens next. With only the help of the odd villager (the village idiot, some young girl) the couple have to escape the clutches of the slow motion underfed Knights, but unlike the previous film, this one piles on the atmosphere. Right from the start these two unsuspecting victims find themselves right in the middle of strangeness, what with the weird villagers and such like. The pacing is much better too, so you won&apos;t get too bored.\n\nOne funny bit was when they used the Blind Dead&apos;s horses to escape, then acted surprised when the horses just went back to the Blind Dead&apos;s castle. What did you expect to happen? That&apos;s enough Blind Dead. This film holds the distinction of having the longest purchased to watched duration of any DVD in my collection. Must be about twelve years!",

Carlos seeks revenge against the criminal Henrique, who raped and introduced her to prostitution.\n\nThe smalltime crook Johnny (Ron Livingston) is married with Jane (Cynthia Watros), but he is still fancy Olivia (Amanda Detmer) that is the love of his life and will marry his best friend Bill (Rob Schneider). Johnny organizes a bachelor party for Bill with their friend Phil (Eric Stonestreet) while Jane organizes a shower for Olivia. \n\nJohnny&apos;s father is the pedophile Mr. Grand (Raymond J. Barry) that sells abducted teenagers to Henrique. Mr. Grand has injured his wife when she asked for the divorce and now she is crippled. Johnny plots a scheme with the travesty Gigi LaRush (Missi Pyle) to separate Olivia from Bill and is negotiating fake passports with Carlos and Spinks. But when Bill and Gigi are arrested by a police officer and Mr. Grand kidnaps Tammy Snow, the lives of these players are entwined with tragic consequences.\n\n&quot;American Crude&quot; is an unpleasant and unfunny tale about North America&apos;s scumbags that have their lives entwined after a tragic event. There is pedophilia, travesty, betrayal, fellatio, robbery, murder, lesbianism and the genre is very confused, apparently a black comedy. Maybe with Guy Ritchie in the direction, &quot;American Crude&quot; might have worked. But the debut of Craig Sheffer in a feature is awful since he directs this movie with very &quot;heavy hand&quot; and the humor never works. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Escolhas Erradas&quot; (&quot;Wrong Choices&quot;)",

Simply by viewing it, we explore the actors interconnected relationships and hear the their stories in a way that makes us care about them and recognize their bruised humanity in ourselves, our friends and our neighbors (or at least as I have witnessed out my window) Somewhat close in spirit to &quot;The Dreamers&quot; but with a dash of neurotic comedy. Not so slapstick like &quot;Another Gay Movie&quot; but with the same laugh out loud, pee in your pants humor that had had the audience both fantasizing and roaring out in laughter at the same time.",

      "reviewBody": "This program was first broadcast on PBS and was shown tonight for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. It&apos;s a film about the exodus of German filmmakers and stars as a result of Nazi persecution and their subsequent careers and experiences abroad...particularly in Hollywood. It begins by discussing how powerful and successful the German film company, UFA, was and the various stars who were to become equally famous in America. Then it talks about the experiences many of these folks and other European nationals living in Nazi occupied Europe had in films--some very positive, some not so. \n\nIn general I really liked the program and thought it nearly perfect. However, a few times the program SAID things which were interesting theories but were presented as established facts...and that bothered me. The film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) was, according to this documentary, &quot;an allegory for Hitler and Germany&quot;...and I, stupidly, thought it was about a guy who got bitten by a werewolf and who then became a werewolf! One of the folks interviewed also said that the monster films made during this era &quot;weren&apos;t very good&quot;...well, that also smacks of opinion...and one I strongly disagree with because I think they are wonderful films. So, take a bit of what they say in this one...and just enjoy which they get right which is most everything.",

There&apos;s no doubt that this DVD is her calling card to Big Things.\n\nI like this iteration of the series despite its creaky gags, thin plot and underwhelming visual effects. The four human characters imbue the film with an infectious, bubbly chemistry.\n\nThe plot unfolds so rapidly you won&apos;t have time to fret over its flaws. Many of the gags, for instance, were old when they were done in Mack Sennett comedies. And some of the details may irk &quot;Scooby&quot; purists, such as Fred&apos;s dark hair this time around. On the other hand, there are a number of amusing back-story gags -- for instance, three of the characters are too young to drive. So guess which one has his license because he&apos;s been held back a couple of grades.\n\nAs for the special effects, the rendering of the title character puts him in the Salem the cat league (&quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;) -- cheesiness is part of the fun. When I caught this movie, I happened to be watching ABC&apos;s &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; miniseries, which features a remarkably lifelike anteater character. It crossed my mind that the money that went into creating that anteater was probably four or five times the budget for this entire motion picture. \n\n&quot;Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins&quot; also provides a lot of material for drinking games here. Take a gulp every time you see Velma&apos;s knees, every time Shaggy says &quot;Zoinks,&quot; every time you understand one of Scooby&apos;s lines -- you get the idea.",

He gets in a shootout right in the airport with half a dozen armed goons in hockey masks, but amazingly the American police don&apos;t arrest him, but just tell him to watch his &quot;p&apos;s&quot; and &quot;q&apos;s&quot;. After briefly reuniting with his childhood girlfriend (Jenny Tamburi), he proceeds to go after his enemies. In typical 70&apos;s Italian action movie fashion, his revenge is pretty cynical--he teams up with one vicious mob boss (Jack Palance) so he can go after another vicious mob boss and the corrupt cops that killed his father. His &quot;avenging&quot; really isn&apos;t all that &quot;bloody&quot;, however--there&apos;s a couple high speed chases and shoot-outs, but really nothing that couldn&apos;t have played on network television as far as violence goes.\n\nEastman, who&apos;s probably most famous for appearing Joe D&apos;Amato horror movies like &quot;Anthrophagus&quot;, plays a rather interesting character. He&apos;s so monomaniacally focused on revenge he doesn&apos;t even avail himself of the various women he encounters, like Tamburi&apos;s virgin or the stripper sister of his father&apos;s former partner. Both women, of course, still have incredibly gratuitous full-frontal nude scenes (Tamburi gets tied-up at one point wearing only her birthday suit--commence drooling), but &quot;Knell&quot; himself is interested in nothing but vengeance.\n\nThis is far from the best Italian crime thriller I&apos;ve ever seen, but it&apos;s not entirely unenjoyable either."

All the characters lack profundity and there is only Chaiwat Thongsaeng who screams &quot;I miss you&quot; all the time. This love is impossible and it will remain like this. If Chaiwat Thongsaeng&apos;s character was really a lawyer, it would be stupid to fall in love with his killer and even to plan his own suicide( the scene in the bathroom). for me the movie is illogical, boring, very confusing and it was boring!"

Jim Henson was at the height of his creative powers when this was made, and it shows brilliantly. As opposed to &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, the songs aren&apos;t as dated, and the celebrity cameos have been cut back which lessens the distraction from the Muppets themselves. The cameos of John Cleese, Sir Peter Ustinov, Sir Robert Morley, and Jack Warden all are funny and fit the plot&apos;s movement. The highest performance praise though, must go to Dame Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin, who may have deserved an Academy Award for being the only human ever to attempt to make love to Miss Piggy! (&quot;Miss Piggy, don&apos;t put a wall between us...we could have had the world on a silver platter&quot;) I also love the music, especially the number in the Dubonett Club, which harkens back to the old-time musicals, with just a hint of satire. Even after seeing &quot;The Score&quot; and &quot;Ocean&apos;s 11&quot;, the Muppet heist scene is still the most entertaining I&apos;ve ever seen! My advice is swallow your pride, grab the kids, and &quot;check right in, to the Happiness Hotel&quot;! (SAY CHEESE!)",

The scenario is the dying days of World War II from the perspective of a German soldier. This represents unusual material for Hollywood, and romantic leading man John Gavin is odd casting as the hero. Although his flashes of American pearly whites are incongruous, he and indeed all the actors do quite well in their parts although hampered by the forced pace of the direction and the artificial quality of the sound recording. Clearly overdubbed, the dialogue has the quality of a read- through in an indoor studio, despite most of the action being out-of-doors. The cinematography is quite good and the sets impressive as the soldier Ernst moves from the horrors of the Russian front to the heavily-bombed hometown where he returns on leave. Trying to find what has become of his parents, he receives little sympathy from his countrymen and women, who are deadened (or maddened) by the bombardment from the skies they are experiencing. Officialdom is represented by a range of repulsive types, underlining the moral ambiguity the hero is struggling with after his experiences on the front. Where in all this horror is anything worth living for? The answer comes in his developing relationship with the winsome Elizabeth, portrayed by a delightful actress whose name is not familiar to me. What hopes of happiness in the maelstrom of the times? A poignant moment comes when the couple fantasize where they would like to go for a honeymoon, only to reflect that as Germans they would be hated just about everywhere. I found this a memorable film.",

IT&apos;S A RAW FILM.\n\nPS: did i mention that this was the first rgv movie in which the lead character is a out-and-out gangster(of course, Shiva too has gangster theme but the hero was a student-turned-gangster)",

The upload seemed a bit chaotic with some zooms I don&apos;t remember from my previous viewing. Since this was her first real time being showcased on film, Ms. Henie doesn&apos;t dominate the proceedings with her ice dancing and scenes which are shared with leading man Don Ameche, comedians The Ritz Brothers, supporting players like Adolphe Menjou, Arline Judge, Ned Sparks, and Jean Hersholt as Sonja&apos;s father. There&apos;s also an all-girl band and a harmonica player who is later joined by likewise players who do some good slapstick. The Ritzes are also pretty amusing if not completely hilarious. In summary, One in a Million is entertaining fluff.",

      "reviewBody": "Not everyone will take to Teeth, a comedy slash horror that at times stretches moral and sociopolitical boundaries, as well as people&apos;s tolerance to its contents.\n\nIt&apos;s a movie that I find difficult to explain, mainly because it feels like something that doesn&apos;t seem aware of its own identity, much like the characters, naive teenagers, who are finding their independence as well as their place in the world.\n\nTeeth starts out playful, almost dream-like, where everything seems wonderful, reminding me of the flower power days of the 60s and 70s. The main character Dawn O&apos;Keefe, played very well by Jess Weixler, is a virgin who advocates at her school the idea of staying &apos;pure&apos; until marriage. All appears positive and blissful as she gains a big following at her addresses to the students, but Teeth doesn&apos;t remain innocent and neither do its characters.\n\nQuite abruptly, the movie takes a twisted turn and things become increasingly chaotic and violent. It&apos;s beginnings and ending are so far apart from each other in every way imagineable and as I said some viewers may find its extremities difficult to digest. Along its jumbled journey it jumps from comedy to horror to moralistic to political to pornography and I found it difficult at times to understand its message, which it obviously is intended to have - a message, but as I said it doesn&apos;t come through clearly.\n\nTeeth is, if nothing else, an original movie and at times thought proking and I respect that about it, in a genre where most comedy slash horrors are copies of each other. Just don&apos;t expect everyone to like it and don&apos;t expect to feel particularly satisfied at its conclusion.",

I could make a picture book out of screenshots from this movie, but even that wouldn&apos;t capture all the magnificent movement, such gracefully choreographed tracking shots. The movie has a visual energy that captures the hustle and bustle of Moscow, particularly from the perspective of youth. But it also beautifully highlights the quiet moments of the wee hours of the morning. It&apos;s gorgeous, breathtaking, exciting photography. And the soundtrack has a lot to offer as well, with interior monologues, heightened sound design, and the use of contemporary tunes (including American rock and French pop), folk songs, classical and moody ambient music. I haven&apos;t even gotten to the substance of the film yet. The story follows a young man and his two pals, trying to find their place in life. The narrative has a freewheeling new wave vibe to it, accentuating individual moments rather than grand dramatic arcs. These are the lives of youths unsure of how to live or what to live for, a generation with many left fatherless by the war. Although a rather long film, I can&apos;t think of anything that felt superfluous, every scene had its own insights or charms. I&apos;m tempted to give this film a 10, but I&apos;d like to have a second viewing before I jump the gun. It definitely made an impression on me.",

      "reviewBody": "On the first day of the twentieth century, an infant is discovered in the coal room aboard a luxury liner. The worker (Bill Nunn) who discovers the child on The Virginian names him 1900 or more accurately Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen-Hundred. Eight years later the boy loses his &quot;father&quot; in a ship accident but discovers an amazing ability to play the piano and a legend is born. It is indeed The Legend of 1900, a fable by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) based on a dramatic monologue by Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco. The story is about a musical prodigy who spends his life aboard a ship, sailing back and forth between the U.S. and Europe, entertaining the passengers with his unique talent but never sharing it with the rest of the world.\n\nThe film is narrated by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), an American saxophone player whom we meet at the beginning as he tries to pawn his trumpet. On leaving the shop, however, he hears the only recording 1900 ever made, a master that he had broken into pieces but that was later restored. When he finds out that the master came from a ship about to be demolished, he rushes to save 1900 whom he is sure is still aboard. In the process, he tells his story to convince others that 1900 exists. Through flashbacks we learn about 1900 and how he navigated his life from stem to stern. The question throughout the film is whether or not 1900 will abandon the ship and set foot on land? There is a hint that he might do so after he meets a beautiful young woman (Melanie Theirry). She inspires him to compose a beautifully expressive love song while gazing at her through a window, but the only thing that remains is the last copy of the record and an enduring memory.\n\nThe Legend of 1900 creates its own world and I confess it is one that I got lost in. This is a lovely film that has a heart. It is sentimental without question but is redeemed by the glorious music by Ennio Morricone, beautiful cinematography by Lajos Koltai, and a terrific jazz piano duel between the adult 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Morton played by Clarence Williams III. 1900&apos;s world has clearly defined limits and he is fearful of venturing beyond. Land represents for him a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end. To me, The Legend of 1900 may be a metaphor for people who find a comfortable niche for themselves in life and are afraid to take risks to see what the possibilities are. In many cases, as with 1900, the world will never know the contribution they might have made.",

      "reviewBody": "If one pays scant attention to the news in Japan, seen Iwai Shunji&apos;s _All About Lily Chou Chou_, or read short stories and novels by Murakami Ryu, one knows that Japan, like other countries, suffers from an escalation of violence in schools. This violence works in three ways: student vs. teacher, teacher vs. student, and, the most common, student vs. student. Although it is still rare, the newspapers and news programs are peppered with stories of bullies beating someone to death or the bullied killing his bullies. Murakami Ryu and Yu Miri have both focused on these subjects in their literary works. Toyoda Toshiaki, through his film _Blue Spring_ also touches on this controversial subject.\n\nThe kids attending the all boys Asahi High School would basically be considered the dregs of Japanese society. The school is rundown and the teachers teach such a drypan, apathetic manner that it is not surprising that the kids could care less. The only teacher who seems to actually care about any of his students is a dwarf who waters the flowers on the school grounds all day.\n\nHowever, although the teaching might be unstructured, there is a rigid code of hierarchy enforced by the tough kids. A leader is chosen by a suicidal ritual in which a student claps his hands as many times as possible while falling backwards. After he claps a certain amount of times, he grabs the guardrail. Miss the guardrail, instant pancake.\n\nAt the beginning of this film, after the &quot;graduation&quot; of the senior class, Kujo, played by the extraordinarily handsome Matsuda Ryuhei, wins the contest. Kujo is a bit indifferent to his new found power, but goes along with it because he has the support of his friends: Aoki, Yukio, Yoshimura, and Kimura. \n\nAlthough many of the students are not satisfied with the way their lives are shaping, they seem to basically concede that good jobs and college are not in their future and that they are either on the track to become either a menial laborer or a member of the Yakuza.\n\n_Blue Spring_ is an interesting film that depicts individuals who are not on the &quot;normal road of becoming a good Japanese citizen&quot;: i.e. Graduation, work, stable family. It shows the dregs, but the dregs also show that social hierarchy exists from the lowest to the highest.\n\nI think that the film is quite well done. The filming is dark, but it fits the atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack is excellent."

      "name": "West German HEIMATFILM with Marianne KOCH and Maria PERSCHY",
      "reviewBody": "This indestructible classic was filmed in 1958 by successful director Paul May (1909-1976), who had also filmed &quot;08/15&quot;, &quot;Und ewig singen die Wälder&quot; and &quot;Via Mala&quot; was still to film. It was produced by the Divina-Film of the incomparable Ilse Kubaschewski, who also had the film marketed through her Gloria film distributor. The film was shot in beautiful Neubeuern, which today belongs to the Rosenheim district.\n\nA young country doctor (Marianne Koch, who has just celebrated her 90th birthday) runs a practice on Lake Tegernsee and has to assert herself against a lot of resistance. Of course, she also finds great love in the form of her veterinarian colleague (Rudolf Prack, 1905-1981). The whole thing is very predictable, but immensely enjoyable and wonderful to watch.\n\nThe cast of the other roles is interesting. The wonderful Margarete Haagen (1889-1966) can be seen as a brilliant doctor&apos;s assistant. This great actress only came to film at the age of 50. As Grandma Jantzen from the &quot;Immenhof&quot; films, the Nuremberg native will never be forgotten.\n\nThe beautiful Maria Perschy (1938-2004) is there as an unwanted pregnant woman. The Austrian actress also made her international debut in the 1960s. In 1963 she starred alongside Rock Hudson in &quot;Man&apos;s Favorite Sport?&quot;.\n\nThe hormonally controlled father of the child is played by the Swiss actor Roland Carey (1933-2019), who is perhaps the film&apos;s greatest discovery. The broad-shouldered acrobat had already gotten a taste of film life as Burt Lancaster&apos;s double in &quot;Trapez&quot;. Roland Carey, who was born in Lausanne, was also a trained actor. From 1960 onwards - thanks to his outstanding physique - he made sandal films in Rome (&quot;I giganti della Tessaglia&quot;). Unfortunately he has been somewhat forgotten.\n\nThe legendary folk actor Willy Millowitsch (1909-1999) is there as Kölsche Jung, who was enormously popular in the 1980s by broadcasting plays from his Millowitsch Theater on television. His funeral in Cologne in 1999 was almost on the scale of a state funeral.\n\nAnd then there is the main actress herself! It is known that Marianne Koch actually practiced as a doctor in her second life. What is less known, however, is that she started the era of spaghetti westerns together with Clint Eastwood with &quot;For a Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964). Hats off to this wonderful actress!",

      "name": "A Must-See for fans of Laura Antonelli and of Italian Comedies",
      "reviewBody": "In my opinion this is one of the best Laura Antonelli comedies of her whole career. There can be no doubt she did better films per se – Malizia, Mogliamante, L&apos;Innocente – but when it comes to a truly successful comedy, Il Merlo Maschio&quot; is definitely high in rank in her filmography.\n\nNiccolo Vivaldi is a talented, but failing cellist at the famous Verona amphitheatre orchestra. Slightly neurotic, he feels disregarded, disrespected, unfairly treated all the time. When his wife, little dorky but likable peasant girl Costanza, needs to go into rehab, Niccolo is there when she undresses in front of the doctors – and all of a sudden he realizes his wife is a bombshell like no other! And how to get the admiration he desperately seeks. Niccolo starts out easy by taking pictures of Costanza in the nude, and gains self-esteem after showing them to his colleagues. But his role plays and increasingly wild sexual phantasies put their relationship to the test...\n\nLando Buzzanca is just fantastic to watch as Niccolo, going from deep depression up to maximum excitement and then anew. Of course it&apos;s a role taylor-made for the comedy veteran Buzzanca, and he succeeds in generating sympathy for underdog Niccolo right from the very first minute. \n\nCostanza is played by the young Laura Antonelli, in 1971 still not too well-known. But films like this one surely made her stand out. Laura is just adorable as the simple housewife, and she does some really funny peasant&quot; dialect in the Italian version. Her dialogs are just hilarious, and although the part lacks some depth, she acts very decently and is definitely convincing.\n\nThere can be no denying the script relies heavily on the typical sexy commedia all&apos;italiana&quot; ingredients - frivolous dialogs and female nudity packed in funny and awkward situations. And oh boy, this film delivers plenty of that. Or let&apos;s say, Laura delivers plenty of that. She is a feast for the eyes, and there is a variety of very memorable scenes. Truly awesome.\n\nBut at the same token, this is not just a Laura inspection. We take part in Niccolo&apos;s career efforts at the orchestra, there is a surprising amount of not too far-fetched psychological elements, and the two get into a marriage crisis due to Niccolo&apos;s desires. There is considerable substance beyond the nudity. Music plays a huge part itself, and the score provides wonderful renditions and variations of classical tunes, combined with very pleasant original music.\n\nHowever, the situations that Niccolo puts Costanza in during the final twenty minutes, are going a little over the top, some scenes felt repetitive. But this is complaining from a very high level, as the movie remains entertaining until the end.\n\nAs said, this is a very good comedy with a funny script and a great pair of actors. Laura Antonelli fans mustn&apos;t miss this!",

      "reviewBody": "I had some expectations for Vampires: Los Muertos. They weren&apos;t exactly high ones, however. I expected a let&apos;s-make-a-quick-buck rehash of Carpenter&apos;s original. I expected that there would be no way in hell that I could take Jon Bon Jovi seriously. I expected something terrible, especially considering Tommy Lee Wallace&apos;s track record with taking over for John Carpenter. I was wrong. I was wrong and I gladly admit it. I liked this movie. It was able to retain some originality while sticking rather closely with the source material. Bon Jovi convinced me, the entire cast was good (even Eddie from Family Matters), it had some unexpected gore moments, and Wallace doesn&apos;t butcher anything. It just didn&apos;t feel like a straight-to-video B sequel. It felt like a well done vampire flick that is nearly on par with Carpenter&apos;s original. Never in my life did I think I would be writing that. Sure it borrowed a little from other vamp flicks, but I don&apos;t care. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that I really missed James Woods. I would have enjoyed a direct sequel following James Woods and Daniel Baldwin&apos;s characters. But for now, this will do. I&apos;m surprised Bon Jovi didn&apos;t write a theme for the movie: &quot;Wanted Undead or Alive.&quot;"

The film shows you amazing scenery of Paris, absolutely not in a touristic sense.

      "reviewBody": "In the late 90s, the cinema of Thailand experienced the growth of a resurgence, a New Wave of Thai film-making that helped to restore the confidence in the country&apos;s film industry, and proved that Thai films could achieve worldwide critical and commercial success. This resurgence attracted a couple of young filmmakers from Hong Kong, the Pang Brothers (Oxide and Danny Pang), who made a series of stylish horror films in Thailand bringing the influence of Japanese horror to the country. Bhandit Thongdee&apos;s &quot;The Unborn&quot; is one of the films that clearly show the influence that the Pang brothers had in Thai Horror, and it gives signs that probably, one day the students will surpass the master.\n\n&quot;The Unborn&quot; (or &quot;The Mother&quot;) is the story of Por (Intira Jaroenpura), a young woman who works as bartender in a popular nightclub. One night, she is brutally beaten by her former drug dealer Ord (Wannakit Sirioput) who throws her to a lake thinking she is dead. The next day she awakes at the hospital, where Dr. Rudee (Aranya Namwong) has been taking care of her after she was miraculously saved from drowning; however, not all are good news, as she is informed that she is also pregnant. As she recovers from her wounds, she begins to have horrible visions of a strange female ghost that seems to be decided to drive her insane. At first she thinks those are hallucinations caused by the shock and the withdrawal from drugs she is experiencing, but soon the visions become more real, and dangerous.\n\nWritten and directed by Bhandit Thongdee, &quot;The Unborn&quot; plays like a classic ghost story, where our main character, Por, must find the answers to the mystery of why is the ghost haunting her and what does she must do to get rid of her supernatural influence. Following the ghost story blueprint to the letter, Thongdee creates an interesting mystery that slowly gets unfolded as the story moves on while putting some very creepy scenes as the haunting takes place. Despite the apparent lack of originality, Bhandit Thongdee adds some interesting bits of Thai folklore (as the plot is supposedly based on a real story) and drug addictions that truly spice up things a bit and gives a somewhat fresh face to the story. \n\nVisually, the film is remarkably good, with both the cinematography (by Surachet Thongmee) and the special effects (good mix of traditional and CG effects) showing an excellent and creative use of their limited resources. Clearly influenced by the horror films of the Pang brothers, the movie features a very atmospheric, yet modern look that at times recalls the Pangs&apos; &quot;Gin Gwai&quot; (&quot;The Eye&quot;), but with a focus on the decadent dread of hospitals. Thongdee may be playing with clichés in his movie, but he manages to pull out some very good scenes that definitely make those clichés work. Sure, it&apos;s derivative and conventional, but the way the movie is executed shows that Thongdee has a future ahead in Thai cinema. \n\nAlong with Thongdee&apos;s direction, what truly makes the film to stand out are the excellent performances of Intira Jaroenpura and Wannakit Sirioput. Intira delivers a really believable turn as the young &quot;lost girl&quot; Por, whose cynic view to her apparently meaningless life gets suddenly changed by the supernatural force that haunts her. Sirioput is remarkably good as the psychotic drug dealer Ord, although it is Intira who ultimately carries the film. The rest of the small cast is very effective, with Aranya Namwong delivering great acting as Dr. Rudee, although the focus of the film doesn&apos;t allow her to shine.\n\nIn the end, &quot;The Unborn&quot;&apos;s main problem could be summarized as a notorious lack of originality, in the sense that it doesn&apos;t attempt to do anything that hasn&apos;t been done before (and better) in many other occasions. However, this also works as a virtue, as the film&apos;s fulfills its purpose without any pretension besides to entertain. Fans of the Asian horror sub genre will find in the film an interesting (and different) take on a well-known story, but those tired of female ghost will only find another film to hate.\n\nBy the hand of creative filmmakers, the Thai cinema is beginning a slow but constant development that looks very promising so far, and that already has started to show good results. &quot;The Unborn&quot; shows that its cast and crew have a lot of potential to become major stars in the growing Thai film industry, and hopefully soon we&apos;ll discover new and better films from that Thai country. 7/10",

He brings home a desk, which causes his place to be possessed by a ghost, played by the beautiful Cherie Chung. He saves her from a fate brought on by her past and they fall in love. The question is, can they stay in love. I think this film tries too hard to be a slapstick comedy. The best moments, to me, are the interactions between Chow Yun Fat and Ms. Chung, which I feel aren&apos;t often enough. Actually, the women in this film are one dimensional, especially a former girlfriend, who becomes an accidental suicide. The actors are good, including the cute Deannie Yip, but I feel the film tries too hard to be funny when it may have worked better as a romance. There is no denying the ability and appeal of Chow Yun Fat and Cherie Chung, but I wanted more of them being together. It is watchable, and its not bad, but I thought it would be less smacking people around and more of an exploration into relationships. If you like Chow Yun Fat and/or Cherie Chung, please check this out. Otherwise, they have both been much more appealing in other films.",

Highlighted by John Williams&apos; magnificent score (a genuinely eerie composition, one of the best of his career), the film builds slowly and surely to an explosive climax which closes proceedings on a note of absolute screaming hysteria (celebrated and vilified in equal measure by fans and critics alike!). The supporting cast includes John Cassavetes, Charles Durning and Carrie Snodgress, all of whom add gravitas to the material. Look fast for Daryl Hannah in an early pre-stardom role.",

      "reviewBody": "Have made no secret of being a lifelong, and long will it continue, fan of animation. &apos;Fantastic Force&apos; (or &apos;The Illusionauts&apos;) appealed to me because the cover looked beautiful and the concept was such a clever one, what other animated film has a premise that intends on destructing Jules Verne? Even if the pro-literary message is not original in animation, having been done much better in 1994&apos;s &apos;The Pagemaster&apos;.\n\nWhat a real waste of fantastic potential. The premise is both overcooked and under explored, and coupled with so many things done poorly and what the film tried to do, it was hard to tell whether &apos;Fantastic Force&apos; was trying too hard or not trying, if this makes any sense it seemed like there was a lot of both going on. Fantastic? More like very bad, saved from total doom by a couple of things. They being the spirited voice cast, with Christopher Lloyd in particular playing his tailor-made character to the hilt, the peppy soundtrack and some cool gadgets.\n\nHowever, the animation is terrible (as said with &apos;Izzie&apos;s Way Home&apos;) and some of the worst to not have Video Brinquedo or Spark Plug Entertainment&apos;s names on it. So bad in fact that it deserves its own paragraph. Calling it late 1990s-like animation, regardless of the valid argument of computer animation having advanced significantly on the whole since then, is almost insulting, am aware that this is low budget but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for such amateurish work. The backgrounds are lifeless, the attention to detail careless, the colours are flat and garish, the eye movements are unintentionally creepy, there is nothing natural about the characters&apos; movements and the lip movements are sloppy and near-incomprehensible.\n\nJust as risible is the script, enough for target audience and who it was aiming for to be severely questioned constantly. &apos;Fantastic Force&apos; is a family film, like most animation, but fails from personal opinion to appeal to both children and adults. Adults will cringe at the excessive gross-out/potty humour, that takes over everything frequently. Meanwhile children are likely to be confused by some of the film&apos;s many ideas and muddled narrative and find it at times near-sadistic. The whole stuff with Profiterole&apos;s gas takes up far too much time and should have been used much less and more time devoted towards properly developing the concept and ideas.\n\nLoved the unique premise, but it really suffers here from trying to throw in too many ideas and do very little, and in some cases not do anything, with them, which complicates and increasingly confuses the story. There were some good ideas here actually, but they were badly under cooked and anything to do with Jules Verne are reduced to fleeting references. What a waste of a potentially clever plot.\n\nDialogue throughout is awkward, the slapstick is overdone, poorly animated and overly-immature and the characters are bland and annoying with any development falling completely flat.\n\nOverall, the complete anti-thesis of a fantastic film. With such a good concept there was a good film in there somewhere squandered completely by execution that always veers between the very bad to embarrassing. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

In general I am not a fan of the Farelly brothers, but I had enjoyed Shallow Hal, and Stuck on You got good reviews from our local paper, which is rare. One thing that had impressed me about Shallow Hal is that the things that you would think were completely illogical were addressed reasonably. The most obvious thought with the casting was that Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are not even that close in age. Sure enough, early in the film they explain that Matt&apos;s character has most of the liver, so Greg&apos;s character is aging faster. I don&apos;t know if it is scientifically sound, but it works in the context of the film. That is one thing that is nice about the movie. The film has plenty of sight gags and easy humor, but there are also obscure references and delightful surprises that remind you that the film has a brain. It also has a heart, and Damon and Kinnear have a nice brotherly rapport.\n\nOf the supporting cast, Eva Mendes is easily the most fun, and gets the best lines. There are also enjoyable turns with Meryl Streep, Griffin Dunne, and Cher starts out as her own worst caricature, but ends up showing a heart as well. Many other familiar faces pop up, including people you have seen as bit parts in the directors&apos; other films.\n\nFinally, I have to say I was really impressed with the connection between the two bodies. Very realistic looking make-up job.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is more 80&apos;s than 90&apos;s. There are two un-P.C. moments that might fly today, but certainly would not have worked in the mid-90&apos;s at the height of political correctness. One is Japanese tourists with cameras (think &quot;Gremlins 2&quot;) and the other is more mean when two &quot;fruits&quot; (literally watermelons wearing hats) are told to leave the vegetable cafe because it is not that kind of place. I only object to that scene because the movie is aimed at children who are easily influenced.\n\nI suppose picking on the French is not P.C. either.\n\nThere is real stupid humor throughout the film, much of it involving the improper use of the French language, stupid accents, and the presence of berets and baguettes. Most of the jokes will make you say &quot;Oh man, that&apos;s dumb..&quot;, but you will be smiling when you say it. Besides who does not want to see a heavy metal band of tomatoes play a rap/rock song? Fuzzy Tomatoe&apos;s stupidity and silly little voice will make you like him as well.\n\nThe tomatoes look pretty cool as they bounce and move their eyes and mouths. Not super-sophisticated puppets, but not shoddy either.\n\nA fun movie. Pretty innocent. If you like innocent horror parody comedies see &quot;Saturday the 14th&quot; next."

All of it culminating to a gutsy ending that might not sit well with all.\n\nThat being said, this movie&apos;s production is top notch, best as ever been animation and brilliant voice acting. The relationships, the humor, the romance, the dramatic scenes, and the jokes from previous installments are all there. And film does provide us with so many satisfying moments and a beautiful message that how it ends does not take away much from the prior story. All in all, this is a great send off of the franchise (for now).",

Unfortunately, by the time the film was released, the photographs from Mariner 4&apos;s flyby dispelled the evocative visions of Martian vegetation slowly spreading as the summer released moisture from the frozen poles or of the great canals, presumably built by a long dead civilisation in a desperate attempt to save their dying world. Too bad, I prefer E. R. B.&apos;s &apos;Barsoom&apos; to the real thing. Like &apos;Luna&apos;, the film will be of interest to anyone interested in the history of Soviet space-science but the depictions of the &apos;future&apos; (i.e. Moon exploration and colonisation) in the older film are much more detailed and entertaining. Amusingly, when commenting on life on Mars, both films refer to the first Russian science-fiction feature: the silent &apos;Aelita, Queen of Mars&apos; (1924).",

      "reviewBody": "Seeing the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it&apos;s more or less a blatant copy of &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I&apos;ve read the entire series of &quot;Hunger Games&quot; (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not &apos;unique&apos; like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; manga, &quot;Hunger Games&quot; includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of &quot;Hunger Games&quot; blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, so you can&apos;t use &apos;inspiration&apos; as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn&apos;t want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a Japanese series that isn&apos;t well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about &quot;Battle Royale&quot; or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author&apos;s job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I&apos;m posting this all of over the web so that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; can at least receive some acknowledgment that the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;. However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; is more like a rip-off of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There&apos;s a fine line between the words &apos;inspiration&apos; and &apos;copy&apos;, and &quot;Hunger Games&quot; has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as &quot;The Matrix&quot; from &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, however they rightfully gave credit for the &apos;original&apos; series unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it&apos;s so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn&apos;t inspired by &quot;Battle Royale&quot; when she clearly was. What&apos;s more contemptible is that she&apos;s getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she&apos;s also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that&apos;s how reality works, right? Therefore, I don&apos;t care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from &quot;Hunger Game&quot; fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit &quot;Battle Royale&quot; genuinely deserves, then I&apos;m satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie&apos;s portrayal of &quot;Hunger Games&quot; is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10."

I mean, the only thing I expect from an action movie is to entertain me. If, as well as being amusing, it is a good film, so much the better. But the only thing I can say is that IT&apos;S BORING!!! I expected to have, at least, spectacular action scenes, since Tony Jaa is among the cast... My hopes were in vain. To sum up, this is only recommendable if you have problems to get to sleep!",

Hanna&apos;s Gold brought back those memories and really reminded me of the spirit of adventure that we all have when we are young. I have&apos;t seen these two girls before in movies but I think they are sisters- like a less offensive version of the Olsen twins.\n\nOverall it&apos;s hard to find movies that my kids and I can watch together, especially in this day and age where everything seems so violent. We watched Hanna&apos;s Gold this weekend and we can&apos;t stop referencing it. The story was well told and compelling and it had a great message for young girls. Plus Dan Benson and Luke Perry were really good in this film!",

      "reviewBody": "Agnès Varda has over the past 20 years or so turned the lives and careers of both herself and her late husband Jacques Demy into something like a cottage industry; by my count at least 9 of her features and shorts from 1988 on have been directly autobiographical/biographical or essays on previous films. Many cineastes - particularly those allergic to nostalgia or to the filmmaker-as-critic might think such explorations to be excessively narcissistic - but they would be wrong I think. Each of the films that I&apos;ve seen - &quot;Jacquot de Nantes&quot;, &quot;The Gleaners and I...Two Years Later&quot;, the short documentaries accompanying the Criterion disc of &quot;Le bonheur&quot;, and this film - explore new ground, both intellectually and emotionally, and the careers of both filmmakers at this point stand as testaments to the value of intimate and repeated coverage of the same filmic territory - &quot;film what you know.&quot; Most Americans will know only a few of Demy&apos;s films - &quot;Lola&quot;, &quot;Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot;, &quot;Donkey Skin&quot; for example are the only ones I&apos;ve seen - if they know any at all, so it was wonderful for me to learn that he had lived with his family in America for several years and made as many films in English as he did - given how generally unavailable - and poorly reviewed - much of his work is, I&apos;d never bothered to look into much of it. Not that I wasn&apos;t interested, it was just a low priority, but Varda&apos;s film really gives one an idea of how much Demy&apos;s personality and obsessions - the city of Nantes, the American musical, fidelity, the tragedy of unrequited love - infuse even his lesser works; this reinvigorates my interest in getting hold of the other stuff, like his serious non-musical &quot;Bay of Angels&quot; (1963) or his serious political musical &quot;Une chambre en ville&quot; (1982). I&apos;m also more interested in &quot;Model Shop&quot; (1969) knowing that it&apos;s the sequel to Lola, and that a very young Harrison Ford (interviewed for this film talking about his experience going into an LA sex shop with Demy as &quot;research&quot;) was originally set to star in it.\n\nWhereas Jacquot was more specifically autobiographical and explored Demy&apos;s early life before he became a filmmaker through extended clips of a few of his films and recreations of his early life, L&apos;universe de Jacques Demy is a more straightforward examination of Demy the filmmaker, with, as Varda says a meandering, achronological approach that flits from one famous film from the 60s to a flop from the 80s, back to Demy&apos;s early animations and then forward again to a TV commission from the late 70s. It&apos;s beautifully edited, Varda has a talent for getting her interview subjects to focus briefly on one film and then move on to another time frame, where she can only follow. Most of the reminiscences are from Demy himself (shot apparently before he got sick, probably in the early 1980s) and his most significant collaborators (Varda herself, Michel Legrand, Catherine Deneuve, Michel Piccoli, etc), but there are also loving recollections of his films from &quot;ordinary&quot; people and some personal observations from his sister and his and Varda&apos;s children. There&apos;s also a wonderful tying-together of the beginning and ending with three young women, seen separately at different points in the film and then together at the finish, talking about what this filmmaker they never met meant to them, with the camera finally panning to his grave. It&apos;s a tribute to Varda&apos;s restraint and control that this is one of the few moments designed to provoke emotion - but by the time we get to it, it&apos;s certainly well-deserved.\n\nI suppose I couldn&apos;t recommend this to anyone not already a fan of Demy and/or Varda, but to those few reading this who are, it&apos;s a must.",

      "reviewBody": "Just as his billion dollar financial empire is about to crumble, a scheming businessman evades the authorities and goes on the run. Hot on his trail are two different crime organizations as well as the FBI.\n\nThe scope of the story is enormous considering what looks like a shoestring budget but &quot;Across the Line&quot; is what I&apos;d call a straight-to-video thriller done right and much of the credit should go to R. Ellis Frazier who wrote, directed and produced this movie. \n\nFrazier has penned a classic thriller which would end up below average but thanks to the different story threads he has crafted as well as an attention and love for the characters and the setting, it rises from mediocrity. The direction is gritty, down to earth yet tasteful and aesthetic enough for the genre, with tight editing and a great score. \n\nHowever, where this movie shines the most is probably in the acting department when again, we consider this is a straight-to-video thriller. This movie&apos;s casting stands out in all ways. Aidan Quinn stars as Charlie Wright, the con men on the run who now seems haunted by his past. Quinn is simply amazing and it is almost unfortunate to see him give such a performance in a movie that will give him absolutely no chance of recognition at any kind of award ceremony. \n\nAndy Garcia is also breathtaking as a crime lord. Far from the standard caricature of the merciless, threatening boss, Garcia plays up the fragility of his character due to past failures. There is a lot of depth here thanks to Frazier&apos;s writing and Garcia&apos;s portrayal. Every other cast member is good or even better. Even Van Peebles, who has mailed performances in so many direct-to-video lemons gives a better than usual performance. \n\nDespite Quinn getting the lion&apos;s share of screen time, this is very much a story with an ensemble of characters, a dozen or so. Many of those given more attention than we are used to, even in bigger productions. \n\nThere are few action sequences here but one stands out in the middle of the film. An intense shootout that may not be as spectacular as Michael Mann&apos;s Heat or Christopher McQuarrie&apos;s Way of the Gun but is close enough and memorable as well as unpredictable.\n\nThe film is not without flaws and unfortunately, loses steam in the last third or so. Clocking at around 90 minutes, there could have been a few more twists and turns and an added 15 to 30 minutes further exploring some of the characters. Perhaps due to the short running time, the film also relies a bit too much on unlikely coincidences and certain characters crossing path a little too often. \n\nBut all in all, this is great writing by Frazier (who seems to favor stories taking place south of the border), a solid directorial effort and some smart choices as a producer to surround himself with actors whose stars may have faded a little but are still able to deliver great performances.\n\nI&apos;ll be sure to watch Frazier&apos;s next effort.",

We don&apos;t pay bills for medical procedures.\n\n2) Universal Health Care it doesn&apos;t mean &quot;socialist&quot; health care like Cuba. Rich and middle-high class can go to the private system, so we have both to choice, but it&apos;s normal that if you have to afford a expensive medical bill (how can afford a 250k medical bill?), even rich people go to the public system.\n\n3) As European living in United States, I can say Americans pay more taxes (direct and indirect), than Europeans, it&apos;s absolutely false that UHC will double the taxes of Americans.\n\n4) This is not a issue about conservatives or liberals, this is simple a humanity question.\n\n5) The Cuban woman made the right question: if a poor caribean island like Cuba can give Universal health care to their citizens, how the first economical potence can afford this? 6)One of the typical points to critic this movie is about wait lines to have medical attention in countries with UHC. The statistics are very clear: there are no more wait lines in this countries than in USA, even covering 100 % of the people (if you are a little bit intelligent and not a fanatic extremist, you can understand that if you exclude 50 milion person from medical attention, your rates about this issue can be better).\n\n7) This people that support the actual health care, I think they don&apos;t understood one of the principal messages of this movie: it doesn&apos;t matter if you have a good insuarance...you can be exclude for &quot;bussiness&quot; reasons. HORRIBLE AND INSANE.\n\n8) Every American had to recommend this movie to their neighbour, and associate (like in other times for other issues like segregation laws or vote for women), because affordable health care is BASIC HUMAN RIGHT, forbidden in the the richest country in the world.\n\n9) A lot of Americans are proud to be good Christians...I&apos;m not sure Jesus and God support a system that treat human being as garbage. This post is specially dedicated for people that love America and the tradition (conservatives), because if they accept taxes for pay national security, inside this security can include this silent and big enemies that are always waiting to kill American people (cancer, strokes...). Don&apos;t worry, you can be conservative and patritotic and support a human and Christian system that support the poor and normal people. This not socialist, is capitalism with human face (normal in other advanced societies where they live more and better)."

But this could certainly be a prototype for those movies. Many of the same elements are here: an innocent young woman wrongly sent to prison, tough and bitter cons, unfeeling and corrupt matrons--there&apos;s even a shower scene! You&apos;ll have to look hard for any allusions to homosexuality, however; the references are so oblique that they&apos;re practically nonexistant. Still, this movie pack a wallop. It&apos;s effective and affecting.\n\nIt&apos;s a manipulative film but you won&apos;t mind. Eleanor Parker projects all the innocence and vulnerability of a wounded fawn in the starring role. As one rotten break after another befalls her in the joint, she loses that innocence and becomes transformed into a classic hardened con, a transformation greatly aided by the seemingly simple device of a head-shaving she receives from a cruel matron. The film has a plainly understood message: if no effort is made to rehabilitate inmates, all a prison is good for is to educate criminals in their chosen vocation, crime. That&apos;s another big difference between this film and the junky sexploitation pictures of more recent years--the latter don&apos;t have a message.",

Credits to the screenwriters for writing a story that everyone thinks they&apos;ve seen before and still keeping the intensity throughout the film. Good acting from Kurt Russel, Oliver Blatt and especially John Leguizamp. This is an action-movie well worth watching. My rating: 7/10"

A fantastic movie called Kids (1999) was done in a similar style sans lies &amp; deception. Does she not think her movie can be enjoyed as fiction? This manipulation frustrates me. \n\nI was recently at a documentary festival where the director fessed up to staging a few of the funnier scenes...someone in the audience followed up this revelation with a &quot;why did you do that?&quot;. he just shrugged. \n\ni feel that sort of lack of credibility &amp; concern from the director when watching this film.\n\nwatch Kids and see how a film &quot;shot in documentary style&quot; should be made. or 7-up/Hoop Dreams if you want reality. don&apos;t settle for this middling attempt.",

      "reviewBody": "Certainly no one would watch this film for its quality acting. Faye Dunaway and Jennifer Beals are the major exceptions. These two ladies deliver prime performances as do a few of the other actors (Karina Huff as an estate serving woman and Claudia Lawrence as Olivia&apos;s nurse).\n\nUnfortunately the film centers around Matthew Modine who continually demonstrates he should have sought out another profession than acting. He is supposed to be quite the lady&apos;s man here and various actresses do their part to try to make him look that way. But Modine just doesn&apos;t have what it takes to carry it off to the audience. Perhaps he will stick to stunts and sword play as he would probably do well at that. But if there is a god, he won&apos;t speak another line of dialogue in film.\n\nIan Bannen plays Modine&apos;s father and his part suffers I believe from poor directing. Bannen is an accomplished actor and should have done better, but it appears to me that he was simply directed to make himself appear pure victim rather than take his losses like a man of sterner stuff.\n\nThe thing I liked about the film is it&apos;s unique story line and the intensity that Faye Dunaway introduces into the story. It&apos;s a story of one Francesco Sacredo (Modine) who wagers and loses his rights to his life and livingness to Countess Matilda (Dunaway). On losing the wager Sacredo refuses to abide by the terms of the wager and flees. In his flight he hops in and out of bed with most of the women he meets along the way. The Countess hires men to pursue him and the pursuit of Sacredo becomes a game for the Countess like a cat playing with a mouse. It&apos;s this last aspect of the film that makes the film for me, in spite of Modine&apos;s and Bannen&apos;s acting.\n\nI also liked the sets and costuming. They seemed well done. I give it a 7/10 for Dunaway&apos;s and Beal&apos;s parts and the story line minus the Modine factor.",

The Rift is a simple, but well-executed science-fiction film that manages to emulate its influences without being derivative. \n\nGreat cinematography, and fantastic special effects that enhanced the story, but didn&apos;t overshadow it. If I had any criticism, it would be that the story itself needed to be a tad bit tighter--some elements were redundant, while others needed more explanation. It was a solid script; a little more tweaking would make it amazing.\n\nAll in all, I thought The Rift was a fast-paced and fun flick in the sci-fi genre, and I would definitely recommend it as a must-watch film!",

However, besides the story and the acting the special effects are great considering that this film was released in 1965.  I just wish that they would show it more often on television."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies which you do not get tired of watching over and over again. The film consists of a lucid plot, the music in this movie is flawless, the melodic voice of Kumar Sanu fits Salman Khan the best especially in the song &quot;Kitna Pyaar Tumhe Karte Hain&quot;. Salman Khan as usual is at his witty best and is extremely charming throughout the movie. Neelam gives the standout performance in the movie, In the first half she plays the role of a rich, bratty girl who throws tantrums at whatever and whoever she finds not up to her standard of living. In the second half, she plays the role of a caring young mother who is grateful for everything and is also optimistic which is a complete contrast of her character in the first half. The chemistry between Salman and Neelam is dazzling. Sadly this was the last movie in which they were paired opposite each other as romantic lead. The three child actors in the movie also do a good job. Salim Khan who played the role of Choochoo also does his job well as a caring friend. The cumulative IMDB rating of this movie is way less than it deserves as this movie can be considered to be on the same level as HAHK as far as romance and comedy are concerned.",

Any cheese here is completely intentional and the whole &quot;Being a teen is super hard&quot; thing isn&apos;t really played up too much. All three main characters are likable enough and are fun to root for. The film is riddled with some really fun cameos that help to speed things up a bit when things start to slow down a bit (which doesn&apos;t happen very often).\n\nI had a good time watching this film, it was fast pace, funny, gory, and original enough to make it not seem like just another horror/comedy. From the trailer you should know what to expect, and as long as you know what to expect you should enjoy this film.\n\n7/10",

I don&apos;t want to spoil a really big moment that provides all of that tragedy, but something happens relatively early on that floored me. Louis Garrel is an excellent lead and portal into all of these different people, and the supporting cast rounds everything off without missing a beat. The beautiful Ludivine Sagnier, the heartfelt Chiara Mastroianni and one of the most gorgeous women I&apos;ve ever seen, Clotilde Hesme, are all brilliant. It swept me off my feet practically right off the bat and kept me floating throughout the whole thing. A fantastic movie, one of my favorites of &apos;08 and of all time, for that matter.",

      "reviewBody": "Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; to Anthony Quinn&apos;s 12-minute performance in &quot;Lust for Life.&quot; Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle&apos;s wife. Kyle&apos;s sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who&apos;s in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including &quot;Imitation of Life,&quot; &quot;All that Heaven Allows,&quot; &quot;Magnificent Obsession,&quot; and many others.\n\nMake no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There&apos;s one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. We&apos;re led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she&apos;s in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He&apos;s so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he&apos;d be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.\n\nHudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson&apos;s Mitch is the good guy who&apos;s been cleaning up Kyle&apos;s messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch&apos;s wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.\n\nIn Sirk&apos;s hands, &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal.",

      "reviewBody": "I frequently listen to jazz, but not in the way that I follow artists or study the sub-genres. I have never heard of the people in the movie and I don&apos;t remember the names, even though I just saw the film.\n\nI even found it very unpleasant and difficult to get into in the beginning, but at some point it started to work for me. I am not sure if my reaction was what the filmmakers intended or if it is similar for other people.\n\nLate in the film the musician talks about how he doesn&apos;t expect to become rich or famous. However he frequently hears from listeners how his music made them see things in a different light. \n\nI think this is exactly what this film does. \n\nIt feels like a mixture of careful planning, (very) deliberate pacing and sheer serendipity. Its lightness might contrast with its heaviness because of careful planning and obsessive execution. Maybe they just got lucky.\n\nWhatever it is, it is quickly summarized: The camera films scenes in interchanging locations, almost flickering between the US, Japan and Germany. It shows people going about their daily business and a couple of musicians performing their art on the street, at home, on stage whilst also experimenting freely with sound.\n\nThe magic must be in the interruptions. It doesn&apos;t seem to agree with how daily life works, but at the same time it appreciates it in a very intimate way. It doesn&apos;t allow the viewer to ignore even the most mundane detail, but urges him to question it.\n\nThis comes at a price and requires collaboration. Like a challenge that is accepted, but not accepted lightly. Energy is limited, but the sacrifice is rewarded. \n\nHowever, I am not sure everyone will agree.\n\nI felt it difficult to watch in the beginning because of that deal. Because I value time. I usually don&apos;t enjoy most movies because they take too much and give very little. (Of course there are exceptions, even in the mainstream.)\n\nWhat about people with plenty of time? Those that feel that time is cheap? Will they like it? And what about the rest? Is it a good thing to look at things from new angles? What if they don&apos;t like the conclusion of their new ideas? Wouldn&apos;t this movie, being so utterly pleasurable as it is, be part of mainstream culture, if everyone did what it does? What about the music? Should we all start playing more? With instruments, other things? What if we all did?\n\nWhatever the answer (or the question), this is an exceptionally good film and I&apos;m rating it with an easy 10. For all the difficulty it may cause.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an exhibit of a very disturbed man, who was part genius, part eccentric and part mad but a true (100%) Artist. Klaus Kinski was a very good actor and he tried this &quot;show&quot; called Jesus Christ Saviour. Many people think he was trying to be Jesus (or impersonating him). That is one way to look at it of course, but I think he tried to convert the bible (New Testament) into modern times. Most of the things he says here, are included in the Bible. This movie being a documentary that actually has no voice over, but only Kinski doing his monologue, though very often interrupted by some members of the audience.\n\nThere is so much to be said, about a man that evidently thinks he was better than most other people, who also thinks he was misunderstood. The latter being of course more than true, but his erratic behaviour didn&apos;t help much either. But this &quot;concert&quot; (let&apos;s call it that) on display here, actually had some valid points. You almost wish people would not have interrupted him, making him go offstage a couple of times. Still returning after a while, but why would you do that? You don&apos;t go to the Opera and shout at the actors, now do you? Either like what you see or leave the room.\n\nThe fact, that he was able to switch from (almost) normal to maniac rage, made him so appealing to many. A controversial figure in German film history, he definitely will make you want to know more about him ... Which would lead you to the movie &quot;Mein liebster Feind&quot;, where Werner Herzog talks a lot about his &quot;favorite&quot; actor. Watch this and be amazed (and frightened maybe), by one of the best artists German cinema has produced!",

Even later you start picking up the story. Yes, there is a story, even though noone explains anything, hardly any word is said (was there a word at all? Maybe even not). all your concentration is needed to find out what is going on. The audience finds itself in the situation of an ethnographer meeting for the first time some unknown group of people, trying to find out something about them. The scenes, which initially seemed to keep on forever suddenly appear to change much too fast - you might be able to understand more, if they kept on longer.\n\nOnce you get into this movie, it is pure gold.

      "name": "A rare foray by an Indian film maker into gritty real-life drama",
      "reviewBody": "Films based on books are a rarity in India. Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.\n\nThe movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators&apos; lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it&apos;s not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that&apos;s really commendable.\n\nI haven&apos;t seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap&apos;s work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn&apos;t ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.\n\nThe actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India&apos;s parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren&apos;t new to him.\n\nThe movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there&apos;s the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don&apos;t harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India&apos;s circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.\n\nTo finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn&apos;t all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don&apos;t watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines.",

Many Westerns have utilized it, with slight variations; sometimes its characters are involved with coal mining; here they are oilfield roughnecks, but that&apos;s about as different as it gets.  As for the casting, John Garfield is a bit softer than usual, Pat O&apos;Brien a bit tougher, Frances Farmer unremarkable.  There is some decent comic relief by Cliff Edwards and Tom Kennedy: good thing, because this conventional melodrama needs all the help it can get."

They don&apos;t explain Sadie Blakes (Lucy Lui&apos;s character) job, they don&apos;t explain their new definition of vampire, the flash backs are randomly in and out so you don&apos;t know which side is up. Its a nice kick back film, but nothing to get excited about. I&apos;m hoping there&apos;s a part two to explain all of that stuff... oh and the dude from the Shield, he did a very good job in his role. But again... no plot OR character development.",

The rest is simply amazing:kung fu fights,macho showing off,soft core,&quot;noir&quot; style scenes,posing,some special effects and surrealistically bad dialog.That&apos;s it! It is strongly recommended to MST3K fans and fans of bad cinema in particular.It is so charming that you will love every minute of it.That&apos;s its only redeeming point:it is a entertaining movie, always moving on.

      "reviewBody": "I saw THE FIFTH OFFENSIVE recently weekend in Italian without subtitles (I speak English), cut to some 100 minutes, to the review will be short but ought to give you an idea of what the film is like. \n\nRichard Burton plays Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, who leads the Yugoslav Partisans on a trek to safety, culminating in a huge battle at the Sutjeska River. \n\nThe film features a ton of familiar faces, from familiar Hollywood actors to Yugoslav commoners. Bata Zivojinovic (BATTLE OF THE EAGLES) is one of the main partisans; Milena Dravic (THE BATTLE OF NERETVA) is his love; Ljubisa Samardzic (THE BATTLE OF NERETVA) commands an artillery gun; Stole Arandjelovic blasts away with a machinegun in the final battle; Relja Basic (THE FIFTH DAY OF PEACE) is one of the British commandos; Gunter Meisner (THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN) is the German General and Anton Diffring (KILL ROMMEL!) is his executive officer. Familiar names of Boris Dvornik, Rade Markovic, Kole Angelovski, Petar Banicevic, Marinko Sebez and Dusan Tadic are all credited, but I have no idea who they play. The Partisan commander from BATTLE OF THE EAGLES features prominently in the second half of the film, but I can&apos;t quite put my finger on which character he is.\n\n The film features a number of big battle scenes with a good number of extras, a few Russian tanks, plenty of explosions and some vintage aircraft. It&apos;s all set to a great, rousing musical score, made up of actual Partisan chants (one of which was used for HELL RIVER a year later). One great combat scene has the partisans rushing up one side of a hill, not knowing that on the other side the Germans are charging as well, racing to capture the high ground first. A great hand-to-hand battle ensues. There are also some rather graphic attack-dog maulings thrown in for good measure. The scenery, as with all Yugoslav war films, is breathtaking. \n\nI saw this on a rip from an Italian video, titled LA QUINTA OFFENSIVA. It was in Italian with no subtitles, cut from 130 minutes to about 100 minutes. It was hard enough for me to follow in Italian, even harder with so much footage cut. The colors are washed out and there is plenty of print damage, ranging from flurries of speckles to scratches and many holes in the print. The pan-and-scanning is bad in some very important dialog scenes, too.\n\n Overall, this looks to be a pretty good Yugoslav war picture, better than usual. It&apos;s probably as good as THE BATTLE OF NERETVA, but I&apos;ll have to see it in English before I can write a really strong review.\n\n RATING: 7/10",

Una O&apos;Connor is a scream as Minnie, the old biddy who is screeching to see the Monster killed, then shrieks when she spots the Monster. She is told to shut up at least five times in the film. Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius is a great mix of horror and humor; he robs graves, and also swigs gin out of laboratory beakers, has supper on top of a coffin, gets the Monster to have cigars with him. \n\nFranz Waxmans&apos; playful score, the cinematography and set design that are both reminiscent of &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1919), Everything works. The perfect mix of horror and humor.",

We see people&apos;s bleak existences in the USSR along with New York ghettos; the Soviet documentary maker is the only white person in the ghetto! At one point, the documentary maker comes across a woman protesting the usage of fur for clothes, and he assumes that she&apos;s getting paid to do it (in the USSR, they assumed that Americans only do things for money). At one point, we even get to hear Glenn Miller&apos;s &quot;In the Mood&quot; to introduce the USA!

      "reviewBody": "I had access to a print of this back in highschool days, and would steal away with friends to screen it whenever possible.\n\nGreat document.\n\nBut it&apos;s not the only film on the subject that should be listed at IMDb.\n\nSomeone&apos;s neglected to enter the 12-22 minute (depending on the version) &quot;Andy Warhol&apos;s Exploding Plastic Inevitable with The Velvet Underground&quot; mini-featurette ...if I&apos;ve tagged it right! What I&apos;ve recently seen is a fragment of live &apos;performance&apos; footage... as in dancer-performers against lightshow and bits and pieces of Velvets&apos; soundtrack further edited into stroboscopic oblivion. The &quot;look&quot; is that of the stills from the show reproduced on the band&apos;s first LP.\n\nIt&apos;s very much a &quot;Morrisey with Warhol&quot; product of the times, a real film in itself, and explains a LOT about how the band worked as an extension of the Warhol Trip in the great man&apos;s own fantasizing Svengali imagination. Heard this way (which means heard only but seen &apos;enacted&apos; with fractured clips of dancers and ecstatics whippers and whippees), the onslaught is a sensual barrage of drugged out cool, Heroin on Speed.\n\nVocal roles go to Cale doing the one about &quot;boots of shiny, shiny leather&quot;, Venus in Furs, and just possibly European Son (where was Lou that night?), and Nico in the middle on a snatch of It Was a Pleasure Then. Gerard and Inga fling themselves around with abandon. Great stuff!"

Nothing good ever happens, i cringe at every decision the lead ever made and the overall atmosphere is that of absolute claustrophobia. Everyone absolutely sucks in this film ( the character, not the actors), they are violent, selfish , mean spirited and cruel, with the exception of Mona which is portrayed as sort of a Venus at the same time as a saint. I thought her portrayal was a bit problematic since we get the idea that if you refuse to essentially take advantage out of someone , then this someone is immediately in debt with you. It also bothered me how the film makes you like her and root for her best and at the same time gives us a lead that sells her short in every chance he ever gets. Anyways, the film was good it&apos;s just a little bit too depressing for me, i got to say though that i was happy that it had a sort of a happy ending, i mean things probably went pretty badly for the characters after the end but i&apos;m just grateful that the film chose not to show that.",

      "reviewBody": "There have been many films about cold war spies.  Western films tend to follow the (mis-) fortunes of Western spies as these are the people who do exciting things and with whom the audience is likely to identify with. Eastern spies only appear on the fringes, mostly to be knocked about by our heroes as e.g. in Hitchcock&apos;s Torn Curtain.\n\nOur film here follows Eastern spies in West Germany, but it gives the theme a new twist.  The topic of the film is not espionage, but rather how the increasing integration of the protagonists into the lifestyle of the West (one can translate the title as &quot;The West is shiny&quot;) alienates them from their origins and compromises their position.  I have some doubts how realistic this depiction is, but in any case it is compelling to watch. Despite the objections to its realism I am pretty sure the Stasi (East German secret service) was raving livid when this film came out.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been 50 years since Rome fell to the Goths and nowadays their rule is slipping . King Theodorico of the Ostrogoths tribe is dead and their daughters , Mathawsintha : Harriet Anderson and Amalaswintha : Honor Blackman are confronting for the powerful throne . Cethegus : Laurence Harvey, leader of the Roman nobility starts the war between the Ostrogoths and their queen , Amalasuntha and the Byzantine Empire . But when the Byzantine force commanded by Belisarius : Lang Jeffries invades Italy to reconquer Rome , it threatens to ruin the plans for Cethegus who tries to uses his own army to take control of the dangerous situation . Along the way , Cethegus attempts to set the two sides : The Goths and Byzantines to wage war against each other . Things go wrong when Cethegus&apos; daughter : Ingrid Boulting falls in love for a Barbarian prince and Goth heir : Robert Hoffman.\n\nA disjointed and heavily cut film based on the novel written by Felix Dahn , dealing with the downfall of the Roman Empire and taking very freely the actual facts . It packs moving drama with twisted events , betrayal , brief nudism , and especially impressive battles . In the picture stands out the breathtaking battles staged by thousands of extras from Romania and in charge of two director assistants : Andrew Marton and Sergiu Nicolaescu , both of whom experts on mass movements . In the film happens some historical happenings as Ostrogoths and Bizantine invasion over Rome . Equally , appearance of some important historical characters as Emperor Justinian stunningly played by Orson Welles , his greedy wife Theodora : Sylva Koscina , General Belisarius : Lang Jeffries and Narses : Michael Dunn.\n\nIt displays an atmospheric cinematography by Richard Angst , shot on location in Romania , Buftea studios , Bucharest and Germany, however , being really necessary a perfect remastering, because of the film copy is washed-up . As well as evocative musical score by Riz Ortalani . The motion picture was regularly directed by the prestigious filmmaker Robert Siodmak . This notorious German director emigrated to Hollywood when he made nice films , such as : &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; , &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; , &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; , &quot;The Suspect&quot; , &quot;The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry&quot; , &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot; , &quot;The Cobra Queen , &quot;The Killers&quot; , &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; , &quot;Criss Cross&quot; , &quot;Cry the City&quot; , &quot;The File of Thelma Jordan&quot; , &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; , &quot;The Great Sinner&quot; . Many years later , he returned to his native country where he made inferior films than those he released in Hollywood, such as : &quot;The Devil Strikes at Night&quot; , &quot;Die Ratten&quot; , &quot;The Rough and the Smooth&quot; , &quot;Katia&quot; , &quot;The Yellow One&quot; , &quot;Custer of the West&quot; , &quot;Tunnel 28&quot; , &quot;My School chum&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Minutes&quot; , &quot;Treasure of the Aztecs&quot; and his last one , this &quot;The Last Roman&quot; .",

      "reviewBody": "A lot of negative things can be written about &quot;The Sleep of Death&quot; (and I will...) but NOT that the title is inaccurate! When watching this, you can either fall to sleep or bore yourself to death. Since I don&apos;t wish any harm to nobody, I sincerely hope it&apos;s the first.\n\nYes, it&apos;s an incredibly boring film! I even got bored reading the other user&apos;s praising review (not BA&apos;s, but the other one) but still proceeded. In fact, I deliberately sought out this movie because earlier this year I watched &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot;, by the same Swedish director Calvin Floyd and also starring the charismatic lead actor Per Oscarsson, and thought it was great! It&apos;s the most faithful and perhaps even best version of Mary Shelley&apos;s classic novel, and it urged me to seek out the other works of this director. I found &quot;In Search of Dracula&quot; (a sort of documentary on Vampire movies that I have yet to see) and I found &quot;The Sleep of Death&quot; (which is based on a novel no living soul has probably ever heard of).\n\n&quot;The Sleep of Death&quot; looks and starts interesting enough, with a setting in the late 17th/early 18th century, and the premise of a naïve and spoiled English Lord in pursuit of a mysterious countess dressed in black. Such a blind crush can only lead to trouble. For some inexplicable reason, though, the whole thing becomes uninteresting and tedious after 15-20 minutes already. The young Lord becomes involved with alchemists, murders that look like they may have been committed by vampires, and a sadist army general (Oscarsson) of whom I never figured out what he has got to do with the story.\n\nThe costumes look nice, and it&apos;s always a pleasure to see Patrick Magee in another macabre role, but still... not good enough.",

      "reviewBody": "The Rogue Song is best described as a lost film, but its complete soundtrack has survived, along with enough short clips and stills for someone to have posted a &quot;reconstruction&quot; on YouTube. Having watched this, I can post a tentative &quot;review.&quot;\n\nLet&apos;s get the (many) negatives out of the way first. This is an early musical, so you&apos;ll need to adjust to the slow pacing, awkward transitions, clumsy acting, and lethargic direction (courtesy of Lionel Barrymore, more suited to ham acting than directing). And it&apos;s an operetta, not the most popular or well-loved musical form around nowadays. Nor are the songs first rate.\n\nBut none of this matters too much, because the heart and soul of The Rogue Song is Lawrence Tibbett, who joyfully breathes fire into the film. Despite the limitations of early film sound equipment, Tibbett&apos;s voice remains one of the most powerful to ever boom from the screen. He&apos;s in magnificent form and clearly having a ball (he loved making the film and showed a personal print to friends for decades). His zest informs his acting too--forget all those stuffy, stick-up-the-ass opera stars who infected so many other early musicals, this guy is larger-than-life in the best way. Tibbett&apos;s shattering baritone throbs with a vitality that rescues the otherwise humdrum score, turning &quot;The White Dove,&quot; &quot;When I&apos;m Looking at You,&quot; and the title song from limp operetta fodder into passionate statements of intent.\n\nThe Rogue Song has a couple of other attractions too. As adapted for the screen, the plot has some pre-code kinkiness--there&apos;s murder committed by the good guys, a horny countess, and a sensational scene of the hero flogged shirtless while singing away like a madman. There&apos;s also Laurel and Hardy, popping in between major scenes to add brief comic relief. Their material is hardly top-notch, but they add tonal balance to an otherwise heavy film.\n\nThe Rogue Song has many of the usual faults of early musicals, but they fall away at the sound of Lawrence Tibbett&apos;s voice.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, I have to say what I liked original Free Willy movie. In fact, I fall in love with it. I suppose it is one of the best family movie and best animal movie so far. For some reasons Simon Wincer, who directed the first movie didn&apos;t return for making this sequel, though we can see again all major characters from Free Willy. Our main hero, Jesse is now fourteen years old and he finds out that his mother passed away and he has a stepbrother named Elvis. Elvis hasn&apos;t got any relatives except Jesse and he arrives to Greenwood&apos;s home. The whole family goes to the holiday trip in a camping near an ocean&apos;s cove where Jesse again meets his friend Randolph and Willy. Willy found his family and all seems perfect for the friends but suddenly another danger threatens their friendship. But now it&apos;s even more serious. The movie was released in 1995, eight years before notorious tanker &quot;Prestege&quot; shipwrecked near Spanish coast and ruined hundred of miles of coastline, not to mention that millions living creatures got killed in the result. It was a real message and it passed absolutely unnoticed because for many people these movies are just cheesy movies for kids only. And in the real life the main reasons of the monstrous disaster was absolutely same  money. The other problem point of the movie is rather difficult and complicated relation between Jesse and his much younger stepbrother, Elvis (played by Francis Capra). Elvis, who has lost his mother, also feel himself very uneasy about the situation and now both boys have to decide how to deal with this difficult situation. The story is basically good written and leaves some place for action and excellent scenes in the cove, including underwater shots. This time we can see whales in their natural habitat, not in the small pool. Whole movie is well shot and locations for shootings are very suitable and good selected. Jason James Richter is as good as in original movie and Francis Capra also did a very good job as rather annoying Jesse&apos;s half-brother. The soundtrack (again written by Basil Poleydoris) is worth mentioning alone because of its rather good musical themes and songs. A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios. A nice message for young audience that you must always think about defending the wild nature and what in real life there are more important things than money.\n\nMy vote 8,2 out of 10 or between B+ and A-.",

      "reviewBody": "B.R. Chopra&apos;s hilarious &apos;Pati Patni Aur Woh&apos; is a laugh riot from start to end. As the title suggest, it tackles themes like monogamy, infidelity and betrayal. Chopra addresses these issues but with a good dose of humour. The formula of a love triangle between a husband, his wife and the other woman has often been repeated in Hindi cinema especially in the more recent times and, in addition to its cheeky sense of humour, what stands out in &apos;Pati Patni Aur Woh&apos; are the characters and their interactions.\n\nRanjeet and Sharda have had a love marriage and both are happy except that Ranjeet is not fully satisfied and he tries to woo every other unmarried hot chick that comes his way (unbeknownst to his wife). Then there&apos;s the beautiful Nirmala who although modern, feels that she is forced by circumstances to work in order to provide for her family. All three principle characters are very well defined and easy to relate to.\n\nBeing among the most versatile actors, comedy comes natural to Sanjeev Kumar and he is terrific. As sleazy and a bit of a scum that Ranjit is, there&apos;s something likable about the fellow. Vidya Sinha too is great as the strong-minded loving wife. Ranjeeta Kaur is spellbinding as the other woman. She is so stunningly beautiful. Who wouldn&apos;t fall in love with her? She remains one of the most underrated actresses.\n\nThe songs aren&apos;t classics but the funny lyrics had me giggling. The only song that should have better been left out is the &apos;Tere Naam Tere Naam&apos; track.\n\nOverall, &apos;Pati Patni Aur Woh&apos; is a fun movie about the common people. The film opens with an amusing animated sequence that tells the story of Adam and Eve and closes with the appearance of another beautiful actress."

His presence on screen makes all the difference when it comes to interest and appeal. The stylish Victorian Era costumes add to the imagination. Though the &quot;monster&quot; was not as appealing, it can be overlooked by the direction of Terence Fisher and the commanding lead of Peter Cushing. I have always enjoyed all of the Frankenstein films from Hammer, and this entry is no exception. The ending left me wanting more! I recommend it to all horror enthusiasts who love this style of horror and Peter Cushing!",

Last year I saw &quot;Chungyang&quot; and &quot;Nowhere to hide&quot;, now I catch up with Hur Jin-ho&apos;s directorial debut &quot;Christmas in august&quot;. The variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery. This film&apos;s major themes are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way Jung Won(Han Suk-kyu) copes with his impending death, and the sublimation of his desires toward Darim(Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, shielding Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her.\n\nThe success of this type of film is predicated on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim excel, being both quite expressive yet naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, Jung Won&apos;s relatives, friends, and clients, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main focus. To LIVE is to love,  but all things must pass. Pain subsides. Life goes on.",

There were two revivals last year, one in London and one in NY, starring Blythe Danner. Although the movie is boxy and stagebound, it does preserve one of Rattigan&apos;s most entrancing creations, Hester Collyer (Vivien Leigh), a woman all at once rabid with latent sexual desire and without remorse or ounce of self-pity for her choices. The performance more than meets the requirement that Hester should never be viewed as either sordid or immoral. Listen, this is the early 50s.\n\nRattigan&apos;s closest American playwright kin was William Inge. Like Inge, he favored characters tormented with issues out of sexual repression and the price they paid for what society, then, viewed as their *sins.* Like Inge, Rattigan was homosexual and often used his characters to illuminate his own dark closet. A video transfer is desperately needed."

      "reviewBody": "Why would a three-year-old with perfectly good hearing learn sign language? Because his twin brother is deaf, that&apos;s why.\n\nIt&apos;s the reason why his parents also learn. I Want to Tell You Something is a documentary following their consequent, unusual, &apos;bi-lingual&apos; family life together.\n\nThe aim is probably to show the unique contribution that is possible by communicating without sound. We see the family in day-to-day situations, ups and down. The twins&apos; mother talks about the grieving they went through on learning that one of their sons was deaf. Hopes are raised and then dashed: the possibility of an implant is explored and then found to be unworkable.\n\nThe basic idea of I Want to Tell You Something holds much potential. Contrasts between a visual and an auditory language, especially when the two are used simultaneously or when sentences are constructed in a mix of the two, could be a filmmaker&apos;s delight. But Nguyen&apos;s handling of the subject matter is pedestrian, however competent. Once we have seen the twins mixing German and sign language in the same sentence, it only remains to repeat the point. There is little cinematic imagination in the delivery, the two sons (especially the deaf one) seem to have had a charisma bypass, and I find myself concentrating more on the plodding, Germanic, (but exceedingly competent) parenting skills of the mother.\n\nCamera-work is similarly unimaginative, such as that produced by a skilled person making a family video. Odd gems fall into the filmmakers lap  such as when the video function on phones becomes strikingly useful (between a father and son call)  but are underdeveloped. Explaining how fish get caught in the sea before going into the supermarket deep-freeze is boring in any language (unless you are a three year old).\n\nI Want to Tell You Something may find a place as an educational video. In its own field, it is an outstanding work. It could be excellent for any parent facing the possibility of raising a deaf child. Or educationalists wanting to &apos;normalise&apos; the teaching of deaf children and helping their parents to relate fully. But as a stand-alone documentary feature it is perhaps more suited to late night cable channels.\n\n(The title is a misnomer. It is taken not from anything Oskar, the deaf child, signs. It is a random comment by his brother. Oskar signs clearly and emphatically  and sadly - that he has no desire to talk.)",

      "reviewBody": "Maneesh Sharma&apos;s directorial debut Band Baaja Baaraat is one of the year&apos;s most refreshing and entertaining films. It is a charming romance filled with colour, energy and pep. The movie can be easily set apart from all the recent films made by Yash Raj Films, in that it is very simple and it actually shows the beauty of India through its two main characters of young wedding planners, who unexpectedly (for them), fall in love. Sharma&apos;s direction is absolutely marvelous, and the film is totally benefited from the fantastic sets, props and costumes, which give the film an authentic feel, along with the characters which look more like real people rather than cinematic heroes. This very portrayal and the script had actually more weight for me in making the movie work. The narrative style makes for a fun watch, and that&apos;s thanks to the dialogues and the catchy songs. The film&apos;s first half is more of an ornamental wedding spree. And it is towards the second half when the story takes the audience by surprise and turns into a romantic drama that is quite moving and interesting.\n\nWhile watching the movie, it is quite inspiring to see how young people from relatively traditional middle-class families strive to make a career on their own. Rarely do we see in Indian films such young people starting to run their own independent business, particularly when all they have is willpower and faith in their abilities. The growing prosperity of the main characters&apos; business is interesting to watch, mainly because it&apos;s not made to look forcedly larger than life, but rather real and gradual. Thinking about wedding planning, one would certainly expect to see some lavish, over-the-top ceremonies, but here everything is lifelike and genuine, and yet colourful and impressively creative. As for the love story, it is incorporated into the story efficiently. The musical duo Salim-Sulaiman significantly contribute to the film&apos;s mood with a great list of tracks, among which the energetic &quot;Ainvayi Ainvayi&quot; is rightly the most popular. &quot;Dumm Dumm&quot; is also very good and is wonderfully performed on-screen. My favourite numbers are the romantic &quot;Aadha Ishq&quot; and the melancholic &quot;Mitra&quot;.\n\nThe movie stars two young actors. The role of the male lead is played by newcomer Ranveer Singh, and he makes a confident debut, playing his character&apos;s different shades exceedingly well, at times so well that throughout the movie it is hard to believe it is his debut performance. But without a doubt, it is Anushka Sharma who dominates the proceedings with her wonderfully natural performance. Just like her male costar, she commendably masters the dialect of a street smart Delhi Punjabi girl, but more than anything, it is her sensitive portrayal of Shruti&apos;s feisty nature, pain and strength that stands out. Moreover, Ranveer and Anushka&apos;s chemistry is fantastic. Just watch the scene in which the two of them are standing drunk in front of each other in the dark room. Director Sharma handles the scene very well, creating the right amount of romantic tension, using some really soothing music in the background, and of course the two young leads play the shy nature of the moment with conviction. It is one of the beautiful scenes in the film (and I&apos;m actually not one of those romantic fools).\n\nTowards the last portions of the second half, the movie gets more emotional, at times too much but thankfully unlike many bland attempts made in recent films in which everything turns into ancient melodrama, here it works. The scene in which Shruti fearlessly and honestly reveals her true feelings without blinking an eye is terrific - again, superbly acted by Sharma. Singh&apos;s reaction is also very real and believable. This scene captures much of their potential. With this film Anushka establishes herself as a capable actress, and I believe she will now be flooded with offers for demanding parts. As for Ranveer, this movie may well put him on the map as one of the most competent young actors today, and I personally find him more promising than most of the guys who have debuted in recent years. The film&apos;s ending is nice albeit a tad too sentimental. The situation itself is relatable, but it could have been better done. Still, Band Baaja Baaraat works more for its youthful, lighthearted and effervescent mood, and is overall a worthy feature which makes for a pleasant watch.",

      "name": "Enjoy SarajevoThe Hunting Party",
      "reviewBody": "Based on an article that was published in Esquire, The Hunting Party tells the story of three journalistsactually five as the end of the film will explain during its comical &quot;what was true and what wasn&apos;t&quot; montagewho took it upon themselves to find the most wanted war criminal in the world, Bosnia&apos;s &quot;The Fox&quot;. Brought to screen by Richard Shepard, this is a movie that keeps you highly enthralled throughout. It may not be as solid a film as his previous effort, the underrated comedy The Matador, because it tries to push an agenda against all that was working for it. At its best, everything is absolutely pitch-perfect: taut thrills, suspenseful story, and great acting. As for the worst, it becomes a diatribe on how the world&apos;s governments care more about money than safety. Honestly, we all know this and don&apos;t need our entertainment to jam it into our skulls even more. Falling into a growing category for meone that includes Blood Diamondthe end result here is a great film that just can&apos;t stop from trying to be more than it is, stumbling on its misguided mission rather than allowing its natural momentum to carry it through to the finish.\n\nStylistically this thing is beautiful to look at. I enjoyed the use of freeze-frames during the exposition scenes and the moments in warzones come across as real, dangerous, and above all else exciting. The joy and genuine laughter emitting from our leads after they narrowly escape death over and over again adds to the code of living life to the fullest that they both follow. Shepard holds some cards close to his chest also, showing us events leading up to Simon Hunt&apos;s breakdown, all but killing his career, however not explaining the entire story until absolutely necessary. Each character&apos;s motives aren&apos;t exactly the same towards the end as they were in the beginning. What&apos;s first a quest for redemption (Hunt), youthful vibrancy (Duck), and an excuse to show his father that he is made of more than a cushy Harvard school lifestyle (Benjamin) soon becomes a mission to do the right thing. These men are fighting for civility and humanity, two things that have left that part of the world and is in desperate need for return.\n\nOne can&apos;t fault any of our journalistic trio for anything they may find wrong with the final product. Richard Gere is spectacular as the fallen reporter, who we will eventually find has lost more than just his career. The desperation is always true and his actions perfectly played against the more sane members of the troupe. Terrence Howard shows us how great he can be and makes us wonder why he still feels the need to choose some god-awful movies between his good ones. The transformation he takes, in just a few short cuts, is rather staggering while essential to his role&apos;s motives later on. Going from an adrenaline junkie cameraman to a stand-in executive whose field work entails setting up outside the White House and Capital Hill almost makes you wonder how he ever could have changed so much. Then you think about the money, the security, and the relaxation time and soon the concept seems too good for anyone to pass up. The taste of danger never left, however, and it is his wrestling with that, by using some nicely timed humor, that helps carry the story to its conclusion. As for the boss&apos;s son, on his first foreign correspondence, Jesse Eisenberg epitomizes the book-smartass attitude someone in that position would have. It is his willingness to learn and bullheaded mindset to not let these two guys do anything to make him out to be a wuss that lead him to becoming an integral part to the team and mission at hand.\n\nAlong with them, every character that is met with on the journey to find &quot;The Fox&quot; adds just the right amount of infused quirk needed to keep interest. While familiar faces like James Brolin and Diane Kruger play their parts well, it is a guy like Mark Ivanir as Boris the UN executive that shines. He is caught up in this imaginary scheme of CIA hit squads coming in to do that which he wishes he could. It appears he has watched too many American movies and the dream of being a real live Deepthroat seems to appeal to his sensibilities as he attempts to help the trio in their quest to find that which is never found. These bit parts bring much of the laughter and absurdity that counterbalances the abundance of drama and high emotional toll seen at every turn. The Hunting Party does not try and sugar-coat what is going on in the Balkans and pays much attention in showing the truth and not what is read in the history books, both figuratively and literallythe book in physical form during a nice scene of Howard opening the innocent eyes of Eisenberg in a bar, along with the help of four of the real-life reporters on which the film is based.\n\nShot with some wonderful compositions and blocking of actors to build a sense of suspense and fear, Shepard has crafted a winner. Besides a too-long scene that goes on and on about how the UN and people in power are only out to create good PR without any work going towards punishing the monsters running free, I have little to complain about. I was almost completely removed from enjoyment with the horribly trite and overused joke with the ending subtitled words, but was redeemed with the inventive &quot;what was real&quot; sequence. To see the humor that was bubbling under the surface for the duration stick to the screen even after the story was finished brought the smile back to my face and made me remember all that worked, letting the more wrong than right final act to dissolve into the background.",

There are some really silly, illogical moments, but &apos;Gremlins&apos; is not to be taken too seriously. You might sit shaking your head wondering why the creatures would do the silly things they do, but hey, it&apos;s all in the name of fun, right? Since these are also fictional creatures, who&apos;s to say what they are capable of and what their behavior should be?\n\nTowards the end all hell breaks loose, and some scenes are disgusting (in a comedy-horror good way), and it&apos;s wonderful! The film has a good, fairly suspenseful, action-packed final act.",

He&apos;s mad at Rothrock, and she&apos;s dead set on recapturing him.\n\nRothrock and her pals Richard Norton and Keith Cooke demonstrate their high-kicking ability in several fight scenes, but the film&apos;s storyline is perfunctory. Wrap-up is rapid and arbitrary.\n\nRothrock, poised for a network TV series, is still green in the acting department here, while co-star Norton&apos;s role is severely underwritten; he merely pops up out of nowhere when a fight is imminent.\n\nPic is from the same team that made Bruce Lee&apos;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; 17 years earlier, but they didn&apos;t try very hard this time."

      "description": " Â“The LicenseÂ” is a modern-day ensemble comedy revolving around the lives of two Roman slackers.\r\nRolando, thirty-something and perpetually unsatisfied, works at his future father-in-lawÂ’s driving school, and Sergio is a waiter at the corner cafÃ© as well as a small-time drug dealer.\r\nThanks to the unexpected death of the elderly owner, they end up taking control of the driving school during the pivotal week before the final driving test.\r\nThe driving school acts as a backdrop for the aspirations and problems of the students: Armando, a Filipino butler oppressed by his elderly Â“boss ladyÂ” who pressures him into getting a license so he can be her chauffeur as well; LiyuJin, a Chinese student who comes to class each time with a different look and a different Â“businessÂ”; Giulia, a Brazilian trannie in search of a more normal life; and Alessandro and Serena, 18-year-olds grappling with their first love story.\r\nCharacters of all ages and from all walks of life, future drivers and their unlikely instructors, come together to create a reality that borders on grotesque, yet feels incredibly familiar.\r\nThe film ironically and lightheartedly tackles interpersonal and social relationships and the inevitable clashes in group dynamics. It touches on important issues like integration in present-day Italy, and gender roles, while never losing its comic tone. ",

      "reviewBody": "WICKED CITY is a crazy Hong Kong slice of sci-fi action based on a Japanese manga and anime. It takes the wackiness of the 1990s craze of wuxia epics and transfers it to a contemporary or futuristic setting where monsters in human disguise roam the city and integrate with society. The film hits the ground running and throws you in at the deep end, trying to keep up with a fast-moving plot involving a war between cops and monsters that never makes entire sense.\n\nIt&apos;s bizarre stuff indeed and completely schlocky from beginning to end. Old dependables Leon Lai and Jacky Cheung play two cops hoping to avert an all-out war between humankind and monsters but the main emphasis of the film is on insane action sequences which have been inspired by TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Thus we get scenes of characters being chased around by &apos;liquid monsters&apos; and even a laughable attempt to copy the motorbike-out-of-the-window shot in the Cameron film.\n\nOf course, the Cameron movie didn&apos;t have any scenes of long-limbed monsters wreaking havoc in hotel rooms or the absolutely bizarre, random interludes seen here. It&apos;s pretty poor stuff, it has to be said, and the direction and editing is very choppy, but I enjoyed it regardless, although perhaps on a so-bad-it&apos;s-good level. Given it&apos;s a 1990s Hong Kong film, the main guys entangle with a sexy femme fatale, here played by Macau-born actress Michelle Reis. The familiar-looking sergeant is none other than Yuen Woo-ping. Bad guy Roy Cheung starred in the PRISON ON FIRE movies. Best of all is Kurosawa veteran Tatsuya Nakadai who bags a great support role and is effortlessly cool as always.",

But what&apos;s surprising is that so political a film can also be so impartial: the anonymous penitentiary is not just a setting where Arabs and Jews are forced to coexist, but also a place where no one is innocent, where PLO bombers rub shoulders with Israeli rapists and drug addicts. Because of the uncompromising subject matter it&apos;s not always an easy film to watch, but director Uri Barbash should be commended for making a strong statement without allowing it to dominate the storyline. The political overtones legitimize (and humanize) what might have been just another cellblock melodrama, suggesting that hatred may be politically expedient (the authorities encourage it to keep the prisoners at each other&apos;s throats), but mutual survival depends on cooperation, in this case by a joint Arab/Israeli hunger strike.",

The Director, who had a friendship with Basquit, does a wonderful job of interviewing people who knew him to really paint a full portrait of the mans character. Brilliant, creative, very sensitive.\n\nBasquiat of course, rose to fame from the streets even though his father was a well off accountant. His life story is sad, in the crusty, white world of art in the late seventies and early eighties in NYC, the obnoxious liberals who Basquiat was often demeaned by, because of his ethnic background which he felt, probably rightly so, like he was being viewed as some kind of primitive animal. Very sad, very moving film about a gifted artist and one of the best of the 20th century.",

No. Deserving of 2.6? Absolutely.\n\nThe Good:\n\nErm.....\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLooks hideous\n\nJust can&apos;t take it seriously\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nAliens are just giant turtles without shells who wear shiney gloves",

It kept me awake with nightmares as a child, and the library offered no help in locating it until I hit that nice vowel-starting auction site.  In re-watching it, I realized that there are signs of the decade it was created (especially in the bell-bottoms, I couldn&apos;t stop laughing when I watched the kids in the band practice their parade because the fashion world has come back to them again!), but there are other nice things. \n\n One of the main details that this movie has is no explanations are made. The Indian woman comments about the ill wind that came with the car when she gives testimony.  The sheriff&apos;s deputy feels that the reason it can&apos;t go into the graveyard is due to the hallowed ground.  (Btw, the graveyard scene is the one that freaked me out as a kid).  Parent (Brolin) discovers there are no handles on the doors, and another witness says that there&apos;s no driver.  This all adds up to a nasty scenerio.  Much like the later movie Poltergeist, you have to wonder if the Indians are right--get out of town! (they fled to the Deep Country--smart cookies!)\n\nI adore Kim Richards, and her sister Kyle is a darling in this film.  As an adult, I couldn&apos;t help but think who would take care of them should something happen to Parent.  I think this is a good sign in a movie--you really begin to identify with the characters when things like this come to you!\n\nThe comment at the beginning from Anton gives the whole movie&apos;s plot a good basis.  I do recommend this as a stay-home, eat popcorn, and enjoy flick!\n\n;)\n\n**** out of *****"

The Coca-Cola poster mentioned by another writer here now seems to feature Wallace Beery, unless my eyes deceive me.\n\nThis is very loosely based on It Happened One Night, with a reporter rescuing an heiress (maybe), losing his job over it and fighting with the aid of two friends to get it back while his bride decides getting a divorce is the only way to get them both out of trouble. The lead couple&apos;s behaviour sometimes seems a little capricious in order to provide themselves with obstacles to keep the narrative going, but the actors look comfortable in each other&apos;s company, their two friends are brightly played, the dialogue rattles along as well as in any Hollywood product of the times, and there&apos;s one zany song and dance in a tiny apartment.",

The great thing about this movie is that it concerns the lives of the characters and their personal problems.\n\nThe plot is about a group of researchers that after a trip in Africa discover some shocking news, that the star Bellus will collide to Earth, destroying the planet. Soon they begin to build a giant rocket ship that will take a group of survivors in Zyra, a safer planet.\n\nThe best part of the movie (for me) was the part of all the cataclysms (mountains crumbling, giant sea waves, the Brooklyn Bridge auto-destroying in pieces), and the music fits with the viewer&apos;s emotions. I also liked the chemistry between the two main characters (Richard Derr and Barbara Rush), especially in the night-club scene. And the ending is very superb for a 1951 sci-fi movie!\n\nThis is a sci-fi movie that every sci-fi fan must see almost once in their life.",

When Jeb is shot by the one-armed Grant Callum (Dean Jagger), Ms. Callum goes to the hotel and tells his relative to stop the family feud and forget Jeb. Years later, Grant is a prosecutor and presses Jeb (Robert Mitchum) to fight in the war against the Spanish. When Jeb returns a decorated hero, he courts Thor (Teresa Wright) and proposes her. But Jeb has an argument with Adam that was poisoned by Grant and Adam snipes his step-brother while he is riding trying to kill him. However, Jeb shots him in self-defense and is declared non-guilty by the court. But Grant has not given-up to kill the last Rand. \n\n&quot;Pursued&quot; is a great western by Raoul Walsh that blends western and film-noir creating an unforgettable film about a family feud with a revengeful man. The locations and the camera work are astonishing and top-notch. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Sua Única Saída&quot; (&quot;His Only Exit&quot;)",

But fear not, Junior promptly beats up barfuls of badly-dubbed recalcitrants, and displays an acute disloyalty towards the intended Confederate recipient of his consignment of gold.\n\nNo-one else - including standard decorative female lead, and bungling bandit companion - is quite what they seem, in the name of achieving mirth in this &apos;humorous&apos; genre entry (ie tiresome fast-motion fights in the Hal Needham vein).\n\nIn what must be one of the most bizarre examples of the politically-incorrect in the entire Spaghetti Western canon, a gang of decidedly effeminate red Indian marauders lose their quarry over concern for their coiffures: &quot;...Nasty man... You&apos;ve ruined my hairdo... I&apos;m sure I look just awful... My curlers! I&apos;ve lost my curlers!&quot;. It simply has to be seen and heard (the appalling Anglicised dubbing probably makes it even more incongruous than it actually is) to be disbelieved. One has to wonder whether this film in part inspired Mel Brooks to do Blazing Saddles.\n\nIn the film&apos;s defence, it probably would have at least had the visual sweep of burning hills and wide open spaces in it&apos;s original format. But it is now so obscure - and probably not without good reason - that the prospect of such a version ever becoming readily available, for re-appraisal, is as elusive as El Dorado.",

      "reviewBody": "Two rather likable but dodgy characters are persuaded by a German ex-army officer to co-operate with his plan to recover some Nazi gold some twenty five years later - various others are then roped in. A particularly ingenious plot makes this film a constant nerve-tingler, with extremely good use of music and atmospheric lighting, and small twists in the script to add further tension. The momentum is maintained right up to the very end. The characterisation is unusually original, each character having distinctive quirks, with the exception that the German plotter is portrayed somewhat stereotypically as entirely lacking a sense of humour or remorse. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with special effects relegated to a minimum, making a welcome change from the 1990s films which can be over-reliant on such devices. For those with an interest in retro-chic, the 1970s clothes &amp; cars will add a further pleasure. Also of interest is the depiction of Berlin at the height of its Cold War division. A definite must-see for those who find modern mainstream films too heavy on explosions and too light on plot and dialogue.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most captivating love stories I&apos;ve ever seen on film. It starts with a young woman (Katya, played by Vera Alentova) reporting to her Worker&apos;s Dormitory friends that she has flunked by two points the exam to get into university. It ends with the most incredible sweetness of life.\n\nIt is like a French film done by a Russian company (which is what it is). The Moscow we see that does not believe in tears does believe in love, and it is not a Moscow of politics, although some people do call one another &quot;comrade.&quot; This is a woman&apos;s point of view film (a &quot;chick flick&quot;) that transcends any genre cage. It begins slowly, almost painfully dull in a way that will remind the viewer of all the clichés about Russia, the unstylish dress, the worker&apos;s paradise that isn&apos;t, the sharp contrast between Moscow and the peasants who live outside the city. Katya works in a factory. She works at a drill press. She is obviously underemployed. Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova) works in a bakery. She is probably gainfully employed for the time and place. They are friends, twentysomethings who are on the make for a man, but not a man from the sticks. They pretend to be university post docs or something close to that and they impress some people as they house-sit a beautiful Moscow apartment.\n\nThis is how their adult life begins in a sense. Lyudmila falls in love with an athlete; Katya becomes infatuated with a television cameraman. One thing leads to another and before we know it they are forty. Neither relationship worked out. The athlete becomes an alcoholic, the cameraman, in the sway of his mother, believes that Katya is beneath him (once he finds out that she works in a factory). How wrong he is, of course.\n\nBut no more of the plot. I won&apos;t spoil it. The plot is important. The characterizations are important. The story is like a Russian novel in that it spans lots of time, but once you are engaged you will find that the two and a half hours fly by and you will, perhaps like me, say at the end &quot;What a great movie!&quot; My hat is off to director Vladimir Menshov and to Valentin Chernykh who wrote the script and to the cast. I&apos;ve mentioned Vera Alentova and Irina Muravyova, but Aleksey Batlov who played Gosha was also excellent. I don&apos;t want to say anymore. Just watch the film. It is one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

Calling your hero Bullitt might seem an unsubtle way to emphasise his macho qualities, but in fact Steve MacQueen plays him as a quiet man, not some wise-talking maverick: he does what he has to do, but takes no pleasure in his actions; and survives the roughness of his work not by becoming a monster, but simply by becoming a little less human. It&apos;s a believable portrait, and the film as a whole has a procedural feel: there are action scenes, but these are kept in their place in the overall design.\n\nToday, the film is most famous for its celebrated car chase, which makes excellent use, as indeed does the movie as a whole, of the bay area locations, but is not actually shot that excitingly: the conclusion at the airport is more original, though it roots the film in the time when it was permissible to take a loaded gun onto a plane. But overall this is still a classy film, dry, exciting and bleak, and among the very best films of its day. William Friedkin&apos;s brilliant &apos;The French Connection&apos;, made a short while afterwards, would appear to owe it a debt.",
