        "reviewBody": "I have used this on our lite 2 for several runs now and I must say that while most items from Thule are well made and work great this brake kit is really poor.  Assembly was pretty easy but the brake kit doesnt stop the stroller, itll slow it down on a hill which is really what I wanted it for but when you say brake kit you expect it to also provide a full stop.  The brake shoes doent apply pressure on the wheel evenly which is likely the cause of the poor brakeing pwerformance.  If you adjust the brake tight enough to actually stop the stroller it will rub and cause the stroller to slow down.  \r\nThe other issue and probably the bigger one that I have with this thing is that the handle just feels cheap.  When you twist it you can feel the stress on the pieces as they try to seperate from eah other.  I worry that if I tried to really apply enough pressure to bring the stroller to a stop the pieces would crak.  \r\nFinally the action of the handle is not very smooth.  Thwere is not much spring action in the breaks like you would find in bike brakes which means you have to rotate the handle to apply the breaks but you also have to rotate it back to loosen them.  \r\nOverall the kit does finction to slow you on a hill but for the cost the build quality and range of function fall far short of what I woudl expect from a Thule product.",

I get positive comments from people in the lift line, from people I pass on the run, even from jaded lifties.\n\nThey&apos;re a little more snug through the hips than the TNF Freedom pants they replaced, but not too snug. Even though they&apos;re &quot;not insulated&quot; they are plenty warm, comparable to the TNF Freedom that have &apos;light&apos; insulation. \n\nAnd now that we&apos;re into spring, they do a decent job of keeping me dry even though I&apos;m sweaty.",

Unfortunately, it does not fit. Yes, I’ve got a large dome, but Smith helmets fit me extremely well with plenty of room for adjustment. With the Trailblazer, the helmet barely fit over my head, and this is with the adjustment knob cranked all the way open. I tried the slimmer pads that are included and got pretty much the same result. I know I’m not the only one with this issue because I noticed others made similar comments. If you’ve got a large skull or just a fat head, bear this in mind prior to purchase.",

        "reviewBody": "I’m loving my new helmet.  The size seems right on.  It sits comfortably snug on my head and doesn’t require me to crank the retention system for it to feel secure and stable.  It is highly vented and the sweat pads do an absolutely amazing job of funneling any excess/dripping sweat to the sides of my face so sweat doesn’t drip into my glasses and interfere with my vision.  The front vents are set up great to allow sunglasses to sit in the helmet when you don’t want to wear them.  If you’re looking for a super comfortable, highly thought out and well designed helmet that looks sharp and offers amazing protection, this should be your top choice!",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve put a couple hundred sporadic miles on these before I put them through a long, continuous haul in a 630 mile race in MN. The terrain was quite mixed. Trails had a lot of bumps and cracks and there were many miles of nasty pavement. These tires aren&apos;t supple or very comfy but they did the job well running them tubeless. It is important to note that the pressure recommendations vary between tubeless and tubed configurations. On the sidewall for mine says, &quot;Min. 72 psi - Max 101 psi with Inner tube. Min. 58 psi - Max 87 psi tubeless. I ran 28c on Hunt Aero Wide 34&apos;s. The inner rim width is 20 mm. The overall tire width on this combo comes to 30 mm. I had no issues with the bead seating or sealant leakage. Psi was 74 on both tires for the race. They rolled, cornered and brake nice in dry and when I was caught in a thunder storm, they did not disappoint. These rolled and turned with no loss in confidence. I did, however suffer an inescapable puncture at mile 220 in the middle of the night and in the rain. I hit a small, sharp rock on a descent and buy the sound of it I knew it was bad. I had a nice 7 mm slice on the sidewall along with a dinged rim. I threw in an Aerothan tube, booted it with a $1 bill, the bead seated, inflated to 60 psi and it held pressure &amp; integrity for 410 more miles. I am, indeed a fan of these tires. I will continue to run these on my work commutes, city rides and long distance road adventures.",

Also, it&apos;s strange to me to zip on the outside of the ankle when women&apos;s shoes tend to zip on the inner ankle. \n\nI wear a 38 and bought a large. Glad I did. It&apos;s a bit loose on a one BOA shoe, but the three velcro shoes it&apos;s tighter. Enough room to add a hot hands pack between the shoe and the cover, but not too tight to where you can&apos;t even get the cover over the shoe. Medium probably would fit, but it would be tight. I went to Castelli&apos;s site to find the correct size chart.\n\nHaven&apos;t worn on a ride because it&apos;s record highs summer still.",

My shoe size is 6.5. The small fits like a glove however, you would have to have the ankles of a 10 year old boy in order to zip them up. The medium still fit ok around the shoe and are still tight in the ankle but with effort can be zipped. I am 5&apos;5&apos; 106lbs and do not suffer from any cardiac anomalies that might cause me to retain water in my lower extremities.

        "reviewBody": "I’ll admit I was skeptical about this purchase, but boy am I did it. This is an awesome lightweight, temperature regulating hoody that thrives as an active piece and casual layer. It’s not like a traditional hoody in terms of thickness, this thing is super breathable and performs best with a base layer under it. The sizing is wonderful, which is something I can’t always say about Patagonia clothing! Perfect length in the size large, and the sleeves are loose enough for movement and layering underneath. Overall this was a brilliant design by Patagonia, I wear this hoody almost daily. If you’re still unsure about buying because of the other reviews on this site, I encourage you to check out the reviews on Patagonia’s website. The consensus is that this hoody rocks!",

        "reviewBody": "Grid Fleece Hoodies are quite a sought-after garment category these days; but this one lacks the feature that&apos;s De Rigueur for the top of the line: A shock cord and cord-lock for the hood. In the lane of these tops that don&apos;t have adjustable hoods, the OR Grid Fleece has a better baclava/hood design; and in the lane WITH adjustments, the Mountain Hardwear Grid Fleece 1/4 zip is the best that&apos;s readily available everywhere except Leadville, CO. These two mentioned alternatives are materially less expensive than this Patagucci. I already have the OR and MH garments; think I&apos;ll wait until this one gets a shock cord in the hood, and maybe presents in less muted colorways.",

        "reviewBody": "When I first saw this hoodie launched mid-fall, I knew I had to have it. But, I held back as the lack of reviews and price was off-putting. So when the sale hit after the holidays, I scooped one up. Sadly, the fit is poor and the weight of the hoodie itself is disappointing. I&apos;m 6&apos;2&quot;, 180lbs and have a lanky frame. I fall right in between M and L with Patagonia, usually going with a M for the fit in the torso and dealing with shorter-than-desirable arms. I opted for the L in this, based on the advice from a rep. After trying it on, a M would have definitely been too short in both the torso and the arms. However, the body of this hoodie gave me a pear-shaped look, and the bottom hem seems very stretched. I think the extra fabric for the pouch also makes the front look &quot;frumpy&quot;. To top it off, the garment had an odd smell -- not quite a factory smell, but something more vegetal. Weird! \n\nI was really disappointed as I like the color and concept of the hoodie, but I couldn&apos;t get past the awkward fit. For $50 I would keep it for around the house and spring/fall hikes, but for twice that, it&apos;s gotta go back.",

I usually order a half size up for thick socks but this shoe runs large so I ordered my regular size. They fit perfectly but a terrible run on the top of my foot that would have been a hot spot. The tongue has way too much extra fabric in it and so you have almost a ruche effect. Even if my foot was extra wide I think there is too much fabric. Gorgeous shoe, poor engineering. Returned.",

I may even buy a third pair if they continue to be made for another few months.",

        "reviewBody": "About 15 years ago, GoLite,a now defunct outdoor clothing company, made the Lime Lite. I had 3-4 colors of this shoe. Several of those colors are now available in the Jasper Suede line. The Lime Lites had a padded tongue, not so the Jasper. I still have the Lime Lite in red. The Jasper is a decent shoe. Fit well right out of the box though the sole is not quite as supportive as I would have liked, nor are they as rugged. The Jasper has a funky lace up placement. I think it detracts from the look. I wound up re-lacing them abandoning the bottom most eyelets. The Jasper is true to size and the color offerings are unique which is what attracted me to the GoLites all those years ago. Overall I’d say the Jasper is acceptable.",

However, after putting on other sneakers, I felt my toes constrict in the sneaker and craved the extra space. The Jasper Suede has become my new favorite, casual shoe. The cushioning is incredibly comfortable as well and paired with the wide toebox, the comfort is unmatched. I&apos;ve also received many compliments. I guess it helps that I work at a climbing gym. 5 stars",

        "reviewBody": "Pros: really grippy soles, even on ice; easy on/off; tall sides are great for deep snow; easy on/off is convenient; comfortable and not too heavy.\n\nCons: these are warm but if temp is really low or you&apos;re out in the elements for a long time and not active, I&apos;ve needed to supplement with toe warmers. Not a big deal and I suppose the upside is my feet haven&apos;t over heated unless it&apos;s pretty warm.\n\nI usually wear 11-12 depending on the brand, but sized up to 13 based on other reviews and it was a good call. At first I thought 13 might be too small but once I got used to getting these on/off with the tall sides it felt just right.\n\nI&apos;d buy again. My 9 year old son has a similar Baffin pair of boots and loves them and they keep his feet warm in all sorts of weather in Central and Northern Wisconsin.",

        "reviewBody": "I just used this suit for the first time last week at Lake Tahoe in 65 degree water, and it was super comfortable, warm, stretchy, and I barely noticed I had it on while cruising around in the boat before/after being in the water. I purchased a few other suits to try on, and I would say in comparison, this one felt exceptionally soft and stretchy (for comparison, the others were the same thickness, 3/2). I am 5&apos;11, about 163lbs, with athletic legs and a curvier bottom/hips. It was so easy to put this suit on, and honestly most of them feel so tight going on over the hips that I either give up or feel full of anxiety wearing them. This one was super easy to put on/off, and feels nice and secure at the neck without tugging or choking at all. I also have a long torso, so finding a suit with a little more length was really hard, but this one fits perfect! I love the raw edges of the fabric at the wrists and ankles, so there is zero pinching. Also, in comparison to some other suits, this one has a longer back zipper, so you can unzip it pretty far down your lower back. This makes it a breeze to change into, unlike some others where the back zipper is so short that your basically climbing into it from a slightly enlarged neck hole. I love the durable reinforced fabric at the knees, which is also very stretchy. I can&apos;t wait to use this suit more for all kinds of things! Compared to the rental suit my husband used, this one felt so much nicer, softer, and more conforming to a body. I think it would do justice to any woman with some shape, curves, or muscularity. It is easy and natural feeling to move around in, and the cheerful tropical print on the underarms is really fun and happy. It does not have one of those neck &quot;bib&quot; things that comes around from the back, over one&apos;s head, and then tucked in at the front, but I have a feeling I wouldn&apos;t need that. The neck seal was plenty adequate all on it&apos;s own. Don&apos;t hesitate to buy this suit--it&apos;s an excellent value for the money, SO cute, and makes you feel like a toasty seal exploring chilly water without a care in the world for the cold temps. 100% would buy again.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had bad luck getting cycling shoes to fit right.   Shoes might feel good in the store, but feeling hot spots on long rides.   I have normal width feet, but high arches.  Given this I stick to what I know works.\n\nOverall the Regime shoes fit great and is extremely comfortable.   My old Trans road shoes came with different arch support fit kits.  the Regime only comes with a standard insole.   To my surprise, my old soles (43) fit into the new Regime (size 43.5) making its fit just that little much better.   I guess the fit kits come in increments of 4 half sizes (e.g., 43-44.5).   If you need different arch support other than medium, get one of the Super Natural fit kits.  Its worth it.\n\nI love the Boa system with very fine tightening adjustments.  You can&apos;t reverse the Boa dial, but when you release the dial, it doesn&apos;t fully release.  It opens up just a little allowing you to release just a little pressure and click it in quickly as readjust as needed (maybe just a click or two to snug it up again).",

Stands out a bit compared to the extremely common Zhik vests, so I like the uniqueness. The tan color is also super cool looking and can work with other colors of clothing well, but stands out (and slightly more visible safety wise) more than just a standard black vest. \n\nI got the M/L and I am 5’11” ~155lbs and 31” waist Male. Could have maybe done the S/M, but it would have looked quite small. I do cinch down the side straps nearly all the way. \n\nPockets are awesome, especially the phone pocket. I only have 2 gripes:\n1. With the phone pocket the foam doesn’t have a cut out for the rough outline of the phone so if you have one in there, it presses out a phones width into your chest which isn’t ideal, but not THAT noticeable.\n2. I use a radio occasionally with the vest and there isn’t a way to clip one on there. (Niche issue) I could have gotten a vest with more utility. Could probably add a cloth loop onto the knife holder to achieve this if it was a big deal for me. \n\nHave capsized dinghy sailing a few times with it already and it has done a great job keep me up!",

I’ve worked commercially on whitewater for 31 seasons from Maine to California to Alaska to Chile to India to New Zealand etc. I’ve taught over 400 swiftwater rescue courses. I’ve used a lot of PFDs. This is my favorite. I love the Astral Green Jacket but it isn’t necessary for many river running endeavors. It’s heavy, bulky, and complex to put on and off. I will always own a green jacket and I will always reach for my YTV as often as I can. Towing boats is not something I advocate for  very much with a few exceptions. Tethered rescue swims are cool and fun and really never utilized with some rare exceptions. Light n fast is safe. The YTV helps meet this need. Yeah there is no clamshell pocket up front but I don’t need a lunch box full of snacks in my person. I don’t need pulleys in my PFD and neither do you. It just feels cool. Shaving 10 lbs off my upper body is worth it. The YTV is where it’s at.",

We decided to try this model on to see what the hype was all about. Initially, we loved them instantly! I occasionally wear them to work in a medical setting and my GF wore it daily while bartending. We both liked the fit, color we chose, being Goretex and being comfortable. After 10 months, my Challenger 7 GTX started to tear on top of the shoe, in the crease where I flex my toes. Her&apos;s started to do the same in 5 months plus her treaded soles started to come apart!! We haven&apos;t even worn them in a rugged trail. It&apos;s upsetting because we hoped it would last longer. I reached out to Customer support and we are returning them for a refund and and exchange for my GF. Crossing our fingers that her exchange of the same shoe will be a better experience. The did not have mine in stock anymore. This review would not allow me to post any photos I took to show you how they aren&apos;t holding up as they should. I really liked the pair I had too.",

I actually like the narrow front, since my favorite LaSportiva Climbing Shoe is the Solution.  If they fit you, these shoes are very supportive.  For some strange reason, they  make certain of my socks descend into the shoe under the heel.  Anklets with rolled backs don&apos;t suffer this phenomenon.\nFinally, they utterly look like clown shoes with their bright red laces, so I replaced those laces with all black.  Geez, the laces are LONG = you have to go over 6 feet.  I used a 10 penny nail to widen the lace holes so the laces would shift better whilst moving.",

You can size up, but what good are approach shoes when your toes are way far back from the front? I&apos;m going to try a couple more sizes, but my expectation is that despite amazing specs and construction, these shoes won&apos;t fit most La Sportiva fans correctly.",

The inside ankle of my shoe started coming apart within.... two weeks.  I&apos;ve put a decent amount of miles on these shoes already and now more of the inner of the shoe is tearing apart.  They still feel fine and perform well but, the fact that they&apos;re literally coming apart at the seams on the inside is disheartening.  \n\nI&apos;ve been a fan of LaSpo for a while now and honestly this is the first time I&apos;ve ever been let down by  one of their products.  I haven&apos;t been exceptionally rough on my shoes, they&apos;ve just been used for what they&apos;re designed to do.  It just sucks seeing them come apart on the inside so quickly because I actually really like them otherwise.\n\nOverall, it could be a good shoe but, the quality issues are definitely glaring.

They are awesome shoes: they&apos;re light, supportive enough for backpacking with a 40 lb pack, and I can climb low class 5 in them no problem. The only caveat is sizing.  Sizing is quite a bit different from the TX4s. My size 45 (11.5 US) TX4s fit me like a dream but these run small and have a much narrower toe box and run small. After a miserable time climbing Mt. Shasta in a size 45 that I bought without trying on I bumped up to a 45.5 and am quite happy with them. I&apos;d recommend going up a half size to a full size depending on how wide your feet are.",

I?ve been using these in the Oregon and Washington mountains and find them to be a perfect fit for when I need a do-it-all shoe. Light and breathable with a technical fit, but also stiff enough to make crossing boulder fields and climbing a breeze. I?ve paired these with a stiffer strap on crampon and found them excellent for moderate summer glacier ascents. I switched to these from my TX4?s as I was looking for something a bit lighter that I could move a bit quicker in. I wouldn?t say I can ?run? in these but I most certainly can get moving on the way down with much more comfort than before. I find I?m much quicker on low 5th rock in these as well with the climbing shoe like feel. However I they don?t climb cracks near as well as the TX4s did. I have not climbed above 5.6 in these shoes and that feels about as far as I?d feel comfortable in them without actual rock shoes.\n\nThe only downside I?ve found as a wide footed individual these run a bit slim and short, but it is supposed to be a more technical fit I guess. I had to order 1/2 size up to get the correct fit.",

I typically wear a skull cap or standard, brimmed cycling cap under my helmet.

        "reviewBody": "I bought this harness with the intention to use it for rescue work. I wanted something with a bigger waist belt to really spread out the load, in particular for low angle scree evacuations where the weight of the litter and patient is hanging down from the harness. And while I haven&apos;t gotten to put it to that particular test yet I think It will do it nicely.\r\nProbably my favorite feature, unexpectedly, is the double belay loops! It&apos;s actually super helpful for anytime a lot is going on at the harness. We were practicing some personal on rope skills with ascending and descending ropes, passing knots, and so on and the extra loop made the organization of the various pieces of equipment MUCH easier to manage. 100% recomend the double belay loops.\r\nHowever, this is a BIG harness. It takes up a LOT of space in my pack which means it&apos;s ONLY going to be appropriate for working off the side of the road. Anywhere where I need to carry a harness in, this one just isn&apos;t going to be useful. And most annoyingly, in addition to the width of the waist belt and leg loops being wide they are also THICK. Wearing this harness feels a lot like wearing a full diaper. Not ideal. Overall I think this harness seems well built and like a decent harness (and it IS comfy to sit in at least for a few minutes at a time, more so that many harnesses) but may not work for my particular application as well as I had hoped.",

        "reviewBody": "From the perspective of a route setter these are the best and other setters I&apos;ve worked with agree.  I have to spend most of my time hanging in the harness and the other 10% of the time trying out moves.  A burly chest harness is more comfy but you can&apos;t really work hard moves wearing those.  This is comfortable enough to hang in for a couple hours at a time. The gear loops are full strength for clipping into the wall at weird angles to find the perfect angle to remove a tight hold.  Two belay loops because sometimes it&apos;s nice to have an extra.  Extra gear loops because you&apos;ve got to carry so much crap up the wall with you.  \n\n\nThere isn&apos;t really an other harness like it and it&apos;s much better than every other climbing harness for route setting.  I have used it climbing outside a few times when I&apos;m in a bind and I need an extra harness and it is admittedly bulky for some climbs outside.  I can see how it could make a tight chimney just a bit tighter, but you do definitely appreciate that cushion while belaying for an extended period of time.  In a low key setting where I&apos;m belaying kids or teaching a friend it&apos;s my preferred harness.  The thing is like climbing with a sofa to sit in, actually comparable to the comfort offered by a bosun chair.\n\n\nIt&apos;s definitely not the harness I use for projecting, but for 50% of the climbing I do, and 100% percent of the gym work I&apos;ve done this is the best by a wide margin.  I&apos;ll be buying an other one here soon once mine finally wears out.  I&apos;ve been using it for about 4 years heavily and I&apos;m excited to get a new one.",

However, we are sorry to hear that you are experiencing some discomfort with the straps. It&apos;s possible that some of the material in the straps is poking through the mesh irritating your skin. Our top priority is your comfort, our Customer Service team will be happy to provide you with a replacement pair of straps and ensure you are fully satisfied with your purchase."

Thats my thing.. leopard. I love them. Runs small. I sized up a half size based on other ariat shoes i have purchased. I have a wide toe box. The other thing i LOVE is the amount of cushion and support. I have done ranch work in Florida for some folks where I travel down to care for farm/horses/property. 20k steps a day in flat Muck brand boots KILLED my body.  These on the hand offer a tremendous amount of support for the heavy duty work. I will report back on how long they last. But i would imagine by the durable heavy dury quality, they have years of life!!",

I&apos;d normally order a med or large depending on the brand. This sweater is oversized in a small, an XS would not have fit me even.  Andddddddddd.....horozontal stripes are really just not flattering. I put it on and my husband said I know you want to love it and it&apos;s just huge and not flattering.  It is well made, pretty, and soft. I liked the zipper.   I guess it&apos;s about what you are looking for, it did not work for me.  I am returning it.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these 2 years ago and they were not what I expected at first. Had a lot of visibility up high and wide, nothing I was used to and took some adjusting to with regular, casual use. I had bought a pair of these &quot;active&quot; sunglasses cause I liked the look online and the name velo... I should have put it together that they were great for cycling, but I didn&apos;t until I wore them out riding. I&apos;m an avid biker and low and behold I stumbled upon my favorite cycling sunnies. The vision with your head down is superb and they are great for beach volleyball as well. The upper brow on these fits hats and helmets like a gem. I saw some other comments about wind and odd distortion. Had none of that, so with a fixed bridge its likely a little dependent on nose shape. Albeit my schnoz is wicked broken so these must have a nice general fit. Additionally, they clean so easily. I&apos;m a greasy beach, dirt, rain, snow, sweat covered individual when I get going, and these would basically get clean with a shirt wipe, never really scratched either even when I accidentally would grind some sand in there. \r\n\r\nI ended up wearing these anytime I needed sunglasses, they are even interesting enough to fit in nicely if you dress them up, something like a polarized chameleon. Most comments I get are &quot;I&apos;ve never seen shades like those&quot; which I take as a fat compliment.  Really awesome specs for the price and stand up tall against some of the crazy expensive brands like District Vision. \r\n\r\nThese bad boys took me to Zion, Boulder, San Diego, and more. Sadly, I lent them out during a roof party and never saw them again. It&apos;s been months and I just got a &quot;fancy&quot; expensive pair for the summer after get sick of staring into the sun. Within a few days, I already missed the velo&apos;s and just now placed an order for another pair. Can&apos;t wait for round 2. \r\n\r\n(I had the all black pair and bought those again, unsure of the low light lenses are, but I love the grey/black lenses for my sensitive blue eyes. Lots of shade and very clear vision still without feeling too dark.)",

        "reviewBody": "This are the best hiking boots!!\nI’ve done plenty of hiking, climbing, and mountaineering and over the years couldn’t find a solid pair of boots. I’ve tried lots of them and they all break apart on heavy terrain until I got the Tofane. This boots are incredibly strong and comfortable for long hikes. I took this for a 6 week expedition to Patagonia. Hiked over 150 miles and prevailed. They took a massive beating on mountain rocks, glaciers, river crossings, climbing, and unpredictable weather. They always kept my feet dry and blister free. If you’re going on a rough all terrain expedition and are looking for a reliable pair of boots then this are the best option. The only caveat is You MUST break them in weeks if not months before your journey. I spent 2 months breaking them in using them daily but I recommend you break them in by going on short hikes. Your feet need to get use to the boots bc they are a bit heavily and the leather if very rigid. If you don’t break them in you will hate them I promise. \n\nAlso, I recommend wearing a liner sock under you wool ones when using this boots for best comfort. \n\n5 stars",

        "reviewBody": "I have had these boots for several months now.  I have put many miles hiking the trails in the park by my home not to mention wearing them all day while running errands, but have yet to take them on a major backpacking trip.  That said my local trail involves jumping small streams, paths filled with mud, tree roots and rocks on steep descents as well as ascents; although it is for yards at a time and not miles up and down those steep inclines.  I tie these boots tight and they have seemed to have formed very well to my feet.  They seem to wrap each of my foot with a comfortable and gentle &quot;pressure&quot; all around, from the top, sides and heel.  I have not wanted an insert for comfort, as the supplied footbed insert is quite comfortable as it is.  The smell of the high quality leather is intoxicating and the light cognac color is beautiful.  The front toe is wrapped in a scuff shielding material and it comes in handy as it has protected the leather many times.  I have not taken it easy on these boots and they take anything I throw at them in stride.  All day comfort and by that I mean 16 to18 hour days from grocery shopping and daily chores to the 3 separate hour and a half long walks I take with my dog in the trails on my days off, these boots don&apos;t come off and my feet are in better shape than in anything else except a Nike Airmax or Adidas Ultraboost. That sort of things is unthinkable in a heavy duty boot like this. Amazing ankle support and the treads of the Vibram outsoles grip wet roots, rocks and anything else on rain soaked trails without the faintest hint of slip.  Walks through shin high grass right after a heavy rain turn the top of the boots darker for a short time and that&apos;s it.  Not even a hint of any water leaking inside or even the feeling of water build up.  They are also pretty warm given that they&apos;re not insulated boots. I think these will do very well in winter and in snow.  As much time as I spent in these on hot and humid days in the trails, they weren&apos;t running very hot either.  They breathe extremely well for a solid boot that&apos;s made of leather, just don&apos;t expect Adidas Primeknit Climacool sneakers levels of breathing because it would be ridiculous to have that and expect any kind of waterproofness.  I always wanted a pair of Zamberlans and when I saw these on a 30% sale at Backcountry, I just had to jump on it; and I couldn&apos;t be happier with my purchase.  The leather will sustain marks and scuffs with the kind of rugged use they were intended to do, but that&apos;s just building character into them.  Between that and the creases you may put in them over time is what makes them uniquely yours.  These aren&apos;t a pair of Ferragamo dress shoes. Embrace that patina and don&apos;t be afraid to beat them up, they can take it.\nIn summary:\n\nThings I love:\nComfort, Waterproofness, Aesthetics, Smell and quality of the leather used and the obvious craftsmanship, All day comfort, Ankle support, Grip of the Vibram outsoles.\n\nThings I Don&apos;t Like:\nHaving to double knot laces to keep them from untying.\n\n\nCan&apos;t wait to take these hiking in Alaska and the parks in the Northeast in NY, Vermont, and Maine.",

Excellent traction on most surfaces, some loss of traction on wet granite. Very stable on difficult trails. Great leather no cracks at all, I use Obenauf&apos;s to water proof and maintain the leather.\n\nCon&apos;s\nThey are heavy and hot in the summer. Also everyone is correct they are hard on your achilles just above the heal. After a ton of experimenting I found that I needed to loosen the boots and I never had a problem after that. \n\nI did end up with a half size smaller than I normally wear. \n\nExcellent boot 4 years later and then still look great and preformed perfectly on my 6 days if backpacking.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been hiking in Alaska for the last 25 years and have been through many boots. I decided to splurge on these and have worn them for a few weeks now. They were comfy out of the box, and their size chart is spot on. I was worried they would be too small based on my past shoe size of 9.5 in almost every shoe. Zamberlan recommended a size 9, and these boots fit like a glove. Plus my toes have plenty of room to move which is what I think makes a difference. I can hike farther with less foot pain and fatigue. I easily hike 50 miles a week, and these are the best for me. I will definitely pick up another pair of these when in need of another pair of boots. This being said, I wouldn&apos;t wear these boots if I were doing heavy backpacking for days at a time. Up here in Alaska, backcountry hiking in the interior of the state is usually without trails, and I would wear a heavier boot like the LaSportiva Makalu which is heavier and sturdier. These Zamberlans are for light backpacking and long day hikes.",

All of the pieces look great and should last forever.\n\nAssembly is another story - so far it is impossible to get the upper bearing snug enough to keep it quiet over hard bumps.  Twisting the fork back &amp; forth while torquing definitely helps but doesn&apos;t quite get me there.\n\nIf I go back to the F*A upper bearing &amp; cap, with the spec&apos;d preload of 17 lb-in, I immediately have a quiet setup.  I ride the DropSet 40 to 50 miles, release the bearing cap and stem bolts, retorque while twisting and ride another 50.  I&apos;m hoping I&apos;ll eventually achieve quiet.",

        "reviewBody": "It was a drop in easy swap of Head sets from my Cane Creek to the Chris King. Much easier than on the older bikes with bearings that are pressed in. The upper and lower Chris King bearings drop right in on my 2020 Yeti SB140. \nThe only challenge I had was trying to get the Cane Creek crown race off the Fox shock. i use to use a screw driver and hammer to get these off in my older bikes. But this one was on really tight with no crack large enough to get a screw driver in. Took shock to my local bike shop and they took the Cane Creek off and put the Chris King crown race on. Took them 15 minutes and they didn&apos;t even charge me. The new crown race came with the Chris King headset I purchased so you shouldn&apos;t need to buy it separately.\nSince my Cane Creek headset was less than 6 months old, it really didn&apos;t need replacement, but I bought the Chris King Headset for the turquoise bling. Once I installed it, I felt this new purchase to be fully justified. It  did improve my bike, Front end felt more solid and these bearings are so smooth. \nThe best part was I was able to install my Cane Creek headset onto my Son&apos;s Yeti as a replacement for his creaky old head set. \nIf you have a high end bike the Chris King Headset is a most awesome upgrade bling bling or no bling.",

        "reviewBody": "My experience after 1 month: - Comfortable jacket, moves freely without crinkling. Have gotten compliments on the green colour. - Light rain and snow beads off it (good DWR), I&apos;m confident it will hold up in the snow. - Breathable, but also seems to keep most of the wind out (at least with a good puffer). - Jacket is a great length (below hips so the jacket doesn&apos;t come over up too much when reaching up). Less boxy than many other shells I&apos;ve tried recently. A good athletic fit. Pairs well with a fleece/puffer. Tighter around hips, but this might be to compensate for the lack of internal waist gaiter. - Big hood - it bunches up a bit when cinched down without a helmet. - Lots of nice big pockets (2 hip, 2 chest, 1 internal) with good, waterproof, zippers (no velcro). The hip pockets sometimes get in the way when moving your arms back and forth - so I keep the zippers closed. - The pit zips are massive and don&apos;t have mesh backing and open wide. I haven&apos;t had to use them much due to the breathability of the jacket. They also have 2 way zippers, so I usually use both to manage the size of the pit opening. I often bring both zippers to the middle to allow - The cuffs are huge and, without gloves, there is a lot of bunching when velcroed smaller. The extra fabric annoyingly rubs against my wrists, but the material has soften up a little since I got it. - Ascentshell uses &quot;Electrospinning&quot; to make the fabric... but I can&apos;t final anywhere that indicates whether or not it uses PTFE/ XPTFE. www.outdoorresearch.com/en-ca/blogs/stories/the-science-behind-ascentshell-technology",

At first I didn’t like it a whole lot as its really wide inflated, it seemed unnecessary in wide at first. After using it I see why its so wide because thats one reason its so comfortable. Best if used fully inflated as it adds more than enough height for a side slipper. Your head wont be hanging low. Its so wide the weight of your head is distributed well and it does a great job not feeling like your sleeping on a inflated balloon like some pillows. The “dimples” also do a great job of adding comfort and not adding pressure points laying on it. Its light enough I don’t feel bad as a luxury item in my gear as a pillow of your tenting is so important for good sleep. \nI am exclusively a side sleeper and this is the only pillow that fits the need to make it comfortable.",

I will admit I’m fairly short at 5’3” but these pants come up to my chest. If I try to pull them down so the waistband is roughly where it is sitting on the model in the photos, the crotch then is completely baggy and sitting in the middle of my thighs. The material also stretches out within minutes of wearing them, creating a saggy look in your butt. I’m disappointed that I wasted so much money on these. They leave so much to be desired and I now have a pair of pants that’s so long and out of shape that it creates discomfort to wear them, resulting in me never reaching for them in my closet. Do better, Backcountry.",

It would make sense if they had a super wide leg but they don’t. Definitely size up if you want any chance of these fitting. If you buy the shorts version, which I did, those are actually true to size. So this is definitely poor quality control and not just this company’s sizing.",

For reference,  I weigh around 135-138lbs, and my waist is 28.5- 29 inches. I am pretty happy with these pants. \n\nThe shorts, on the other hand,  were at least 2” too big around the waist in a medium. In small, they fit, but I thought maybe I would like them\nTo be a little larger through the hips and thighs. I should have kept the size small shorts. I ended up reordering them. I find it strange that they are so different, and there is a very significant difference between the sizes of the shorts. I can’t be sure about the pants, but I would suggest if you believe they might fit slightly better in another size but they do fit you, that you keep them until you get the other size and try them on. I have my fingers crossed that the sizes are consistent within the item, or I could be making a mistake (again). Overall,  they are cute for the price, and they will be helpful in this summer’s hot weather.",

I size up based on what people were saying. It is most definitely TRUE TO SIZE. For reference, I am 5&apos;4&quot;, athletic build, and weigh 138-140lbs. I ordered a M and they almost fall off my waist! I could size down to a S or maybe even an XS. My normal size is around a 4 for reference. I hope this helps people and you are led astray because other that than, these pants are super lightweight and airy which I love!",

One of the arms moves relatively easily when I loosen the clip that tightens it in place, but the other one does not even when the clip is totally loose. Sometimes I can loosen the arm by prying at the hinger with a screwdriver, but other times I end up taking the clip off and hammering on the bolt to loosen it.\r\nWe owned an earlier version of this rack for many years--it was a little less robust but great to use.",

Used the website tool to determine whether it would fit my vehicle and found it would so ordered it.   Purchase and shipping tracking worked well and it arrived about a week later at the post office.   Got around to giving a try to install it one week later.   The instructions are not great particularly viz a viz the anti-sway support that is on one of the two bike frame supports and it folds down 90 degrees.   Fortunately there were YouTube videos that set me straight.    It is simple to install after the first time and holds the bikes firmly in place.   I have 3 bikes with 56 and 58 frame sizes and it&apos;s plenty roomy.    Highly recommend!",

Not only would the bike closest to my car scratch my car,  it&apos;s already a tight squeeze with 2 bikes on the 3 bike option.\r\n\r\nThe system is also really difficult to fit on most mountain bikes because the support buckles are so large, which is super unfortunate. We ended up having to get another bike because one of our mountain bikes was completely impossible to get on the rack because it&apos;s frame wasn&apos;t the standard &quot;triangle&quot; Thule assumes it is. \r\n\r\nIt is also a huge pain that there is no built in way to lock it to your car (and the car lock Thule sells separately can be easily cut), so we have to disassemble it and put it away in our car every time we go on a trip so that we can be sure it isn&apos;t easily stolen. That&apos;s a big pain too.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I&apos;m glad I got this as it is going the job for now. But, I will likely consider upgrading to something more expensive because I am also pretty disappointed.\r\n\r\nBought the Thule Gateway Pro 3 for a 2010 chevy cobalt.",

Anti-sway cages are only installed on every other cradle. This is because the cage only needs to be attached to the seatpost tube and the bikes should alternate direction to remain balanced on the rack.

You need to use more oil/butter than you think to prevent sticking, a bit of a learning curve compared to ceramic pots, but I chose this one as I believe the materials will last for many, many years of use. \nSide note: I&apos;ve had the stainless steel stow-a-way pot for over 15 years and it&apos;s still great.

The pot hot fully discolorated be ause of the heat. \n\nTo me this pot feel the same quality as one you could get at a dollar market. \n\nIt&apos;s sad, because most of MSR product are bomber. But don&apos;t go with this one if you want something durable.\n\nI used a MSR XGK burner for my test.\n\nSuggest for MSR: This set is very light, but I think you went at the cost of durability. This pan doesn&apos;t have enough metal on the base to properly resist the heat generated by a burner.",

This thing can do it all and has stood up to hundreds of miles of abuse. Do not listen to the detractors, this bag is the real deal. \n\nThis model in particular is better due to the mesh pockets which allow you to dry things. Only this that made this bag better was buying some elastic cord to attach ice tools and crampons to the outside of the center mesh pouch using the eyelets that are already there.",

I am just picky, I want my adjustments to be flush. I have a 29.5 inch waist. The harness looks super cool and has all the basic features for ice rock ect. Some people may think its a little bulky for a harness, but thats what adds the comfort. The adjustments for the leg loops are capped out and only tight maybe 3 inches? SO consider that, the legs on the large fit just barely at full tightness. Although those never really have to be tight let alone snug.",

The 3 way adjustment of the visor will allow goggles to placed on the forehead area. The weight of the helmet is amazing. It?s lighter than my half shell helmet and didn?t notice the weight when I wore the helmet. The helmet has a nice snug fit without added pressure. The replaceable cheek pads and helmet liner allows you to custom fit your helmet. I ordered a size medium and didn?t need to customize it. \nOverall the helmet is perfect for your first full face or as an upgrade. The SERT technology approaches head safety with an advance design. The 23 ventilations keeps you cool during longer rides or bombing downhill trails. You view is not impeded by the helmet.",

They have the low profile toe for slipping into hard to jamb size cracks and the flexible rubber over the tops of the toes protects well. \nI wore these climbing on Southern Utah sand stone a lot this spring and after ten years of looking I finally found the perfect crack climbing shoe. \nSize them comfortably like you would any crack climbing shoe.",

They dont have the fit to accommodate an athletic/trendy fit. And if you aren&apos;t the specific body type they aren&apos;t flattering. They look large but not baggy. Just like I have the wrong size with no shape. If I sized down the waist would be too tight. To note I wear a 27 jeans, 138lbs. Size 4-6 in jeans, but I usually size up to a medium in athetic apparel. I bought a size medium and Im glad I did. Unless you have a very small waist, you couldn&apos;t size below the medium for a tighter fit around the legs. At 27 waist it is maxed tightness unless I wanted a pinching look. It looks like this is a motherly fit for sledding. Coming from a mom. Boxy fit. Pro is I can fit layers underneath and the color &quot;olive green&quot; is nice.",

        "reviewBody": "Shoes look really nice. Unfortunately I went by the sizing chart that back country provides. I need a 9.5, which per their chart is a 44. Upon arrival I pull the shoes out, try them on, walk around in them. Thought maybe it’s because it’s “wide”. Walked around some more and just couldn’t get over how much space I have. Finally I checked the sizing on the box and shoe itself. Lo and behold, 44 = US 10. So not only did I get a 10 but a 10 wide! So of course it’s way too big. I go to the Shimano site to figure out what’s going on and there it confirmed that 44 = 10. The sizing chart needs to be updated! Returning!",

        "reviewBody": "...That&apos;s a bit dramatic, I know.\nA friend of mine who owned a bike shop started carrying these in his store. He gave me a warning that I will never forget, &quot;If you buy these socks, you will no longer want to wear any other brand of sock.&quot; I purchased the Pursuit Four in charcoal and went home, tried them on, and I knew my friend was right. That was over 10yrs ago. My sock drawer is now 85% Swiftwicks with the remaining 15% being freebies from events or old hiking socks that I should probably throw out.\nThese socks wrap your foot with just the right amount of compression. It&apos;s like they&apos;re giving your feet a hug. There are no annoying seams anywhere and no weird bunching material in places like next to your pinky toe. The Pursuits have a reasonable thickness to them, but because they&apos;re merino wool, they&apos;re not too hot. In fact, I wear these on rides in the summer heat of central TX and they actually regulate my foot temperature very well. On absolute scorchers, I&apos;ll switch over to my Swiftwick Vision or Aspires. But these really are good all year round. They are the perfect sock. There is none better. And I now ask for them for Christmas every year. So, now I pass on the warning. If you get these, you just might not want to wear anything else.",

The padded front warps and causes the zipper to curl inward. It is a struggle to open and close the zipper. This has been made worse by the weird plastic coating that is on top of the zipper. I suppose this was to create a water seal but what use it that if it makes the zipper nearly unusable? Just a mess all the way around. Please go back to the old design and get rid of the padded pocket and coated zippers!",

        "reviewBody": "I fly about 50-75 times a year; I never check bags. I travel with a roller and a backpack. I&apos;ve used the Osprey Transporter series (4 wheeled and updated 4 wheeled carry on size) and the Ozone (2 and 4 wheeled carry on size) series; I&apos;ve used backpacks in each series. These systems have progressively gotten worse, and this roller is rock-bottom bad. First - it tips over. It tipped over in my kitchen repeatedly before I even left my house. This is even worse when a backpack is on top of it. The laptop sleeve is mostly useless space - and this is made worse because the opening at the top of the sleeve is too narrow to reach the bulky empty space at the bottom of the sleeve. There is no good handle at the top of the bag to use to pull the bag out of an overhead compartment on a plane. The bag sits high off the ground, so there is a lot of wasted space beneath the bag that could have been used to increase packing volume. It&apos;s almost like the bag was intentionally designed to sabotage its intended purpose. Have you guys (yes Osprey design team, you) ever traveled before? Did anyone test this out (at all)? It is horrible. I started using Osprey backpacks in the mid 90s on some long trail hikes, and those bags were awesome. My recent experiences with the Transporter and Ozone series bags are almost entirely opposite. The Almighty Guarantee isn&apos;t so great when it costs money to send bags back because the wheels won&apos;t roll (seriously) or the handle breaks in half (true story) ... or now, when a bag cannot even reliably stand upright. This bag is completely useless as a roller, and you don&apos;t even have to travel to realize it. Just imagine standing in a crowded airport and having your entire bag fall over onto someone. Or even trying to pack the bag usefully ... or trying to pull it out of an overhead bin when people are waiting impatiently to get off a plane. What a disaster. Osprey, I&apos;m done. Thanks for the ... effort?",

It is easy to grab and once you get the hang of the handle, even though it feels a bit flimsy, it works well. I am, however, on the hunt for the perfect bag, and that would include zippers that glide, and a front pocket with easier access than this bag has. It would be especially wonderful to have an expandable option, even though this fit everything I needed it too.",

The blades are big enough to handle paddling into a current and handy enough for close quarters work in a tupelo swamp.  There was remarkably little fatigue and I only came back in when it was starting to get dark.   215 mm size was perfect for a short (5&apos;4&quot;) paddler with a narrow (22&quot;) touring kayak.",

        "reviewBody": "I am not sure I am the best to review this bike but I hope this helps someone.  Very experienced cyclist but I wanted a hardtail mountain bike as I ride a particular single track ride 3 to 4 times a week and through the winter here in Colorado.  It is not that technical and basically a training ride.  So the good about the bike is I love the frame and the geometry of the bike.  The components are terrific. The shifting is smooth and precise.  Love the single chainring with the wide range of gears on the free wheel.  Brakes are great and the auto seat adjustment is fantastic.  The bad is I do not like the seat adjustment design as I am used to having my saddle way back on my current bike full suspension 10 year old Yeti.  I am sure it is just how modern bikes are set up but the stem seems to close to me and no way to extend it out.  The bike comes with basically the longest stem you can use with these bars.  For me, as I have an abnormally long torso, this is the main problem with the bike.  I may have to change out the bars and stem to make this perfect for me.  I just can&apos;t seem to get comfortable and will have to adjust my riding style to a more upright position.  And you just don&apos;t realize these things typically until you ride the bike a lot.  I am also trying to get used to going from a 27.5&quot; wheels to 29&quot; wheels.  These are great to climb with but it just seems a bit high and not as nimble.  I am sure I will adjust.  Overall a great bike needing some changes to fit me perfectly.",

My only complaint/caution would be for athletes with thick legs - size up. The waist adjust is super flexible, so you&apos;ll be able to take it back out of the waist. I normally wear a 30 and I ended up fitting best in a 34 with the waist adjust cranked all the way down (leaving room for base layers, etc).",

You can wallow in waist deep snow for hours and never feel an ounce of moisture. \n\nWind protection was notable as well.
