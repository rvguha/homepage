      "reviewBody": "(59%) A real piece of all over the place Hollywood that shuffles itself around like a deck of cards every other scene. The main focus is not on DeNiro, or even Edward Burns, but on two eastern European maniacs who feature heavily throughout. What makes this so uneven is the tone. It starts as a crime thriller, then there&apos;s some breaking news exploitation satire with Kelsey Grammar, then DeNiro comes in turning it more into a cop action movie, then there&apos;s a series of quite sweet romantic scenes that come in between footage of the two bad guys filming themselves murdering someone making everything feel more than a little slapdash. Yet it sort of works mainly because everything happens so fast, and there&apos;s so much of it to get through. The fact that the cast is more than capable doesn&apos;t hurt much either, and it is quite well made too so you just sort of except the flaws as they arrive. It&apos;s just action cop movie thrillers, romance, a playful sense of humour, and snuff movies all mixed together doesn&apos;t create a great recipe for success.",

The film highlights how people will use faith differently. Whether it be as a hobby, as a way of coping, or as a way-of-life. 3. The cinematography is almost perfect. Everything from the lighting, the framing, and the long impactful shots are just incredible. 4. Cécile collapsing on the floor is legitimately heartbreaking as even though before she was mostly stern and stoic, it was obvious that she cared for the patients. 5. Christine finding the ability to walk again is genuinely uplifting, and her reaction really helps to ground the &quot;miracle&quot; as she milks the newly-found attention after being ignored for awhile. It also rams home the ending with blunt force.\n\nCons: 1. Some of the scenes last a little too long. 2. The audio, at times, is distractingly out-of-sync.",

      "reviewBody": "The King and I has been my favorite Rodgers&amp;Hammerstein show for many years. I love the score and the only real criticism I have of this film version is that it did not contain the entire score from the Broadway show. It also did not contain the magical performance of Gertrude Lawrence in her final role. But that was beyond the scope of 20th Century Fox and Darryl Zanuck.\n\nThe versions of The King and I that we usually see performed give emphasis to the role of the King. As Gertrude Lawrence was dying in 1952 she made a deathbed request that the billing on the show be changed and that Yul Brynner be given top billing instead of whatever female would be replacing Lawrence as Anna Leonowens. That was done and it has remained so ever since.\n\nThe role of King Mongkut of Siam became like Dracula was for Bela Lugosi, a part that no matter what else he did, Yul Brynner couldn&apos;t escape from. The air of authority he establishes as the King holds you and binds you to every move he makes in the part. I&apos;m told that as good as this screen version is, to see him on stage was the real deal. The critical acclaim he got from the Broadway run no doubt led to him winning an Oscar as Best Actor for 1956.\n\nStanding in for Gertrude Lawrence quite ably is Deborah Kerr who got one of her several nominations for Best Actress for this film. Unfortunately her voice is dubbed by that well known vocal stand-in Marni Nixon as is Rita Moreno as Tuptim and Carlos Rivas as Lun Tha the second romantic leads. The part does call more for an actress than a singer. Gertrude Lawrence was the very best of both.\n\nSo many popular standards come from this score, more than any other score Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, II wrote. From philosophical tunes like Getting to Know You and I Whistle a Happy Tune and such romantic ballads as Hello Young Lovers, We Kiss in a Shadow, Something Wonderful and Shall We Dance will be done forever. Somewhere now on planet earth there is some theatrical company doing the King and I and performing these great songs. You can&apos;t also forget those that didn&apos;t make the cut here like I Have Dreamed and My Lord and Master.\n\nThe most interesting song that Dick and Oscar wrote is the solo for the King, A Puzzlement. It&apos;s very similar to the Soliliquy in Carousel where the song explains all the character motivations of Billy Bigelow. King Mongkut, a very real historic figure who wanted very much to move his country into the modern era, but his entire upbringing fights against his desire. A Puzzlement is a wonderful number that goes into the problems of governing and not just for monarchies. Listen to Hammerstein&apos;s lyrics, they are very much relevant today.\n\nI visited Thailand in 1999 and learned a great deal about the country in those two days. King Mongkut&apos;s descendants rule today as constitutional and beloved monarchs. In fact this film which probably did more to encourage tourism to Thailand than anything else is banned in that country. Because it shows the king in what the Thais feel as an irreverent light. It is indeed a puzzlement.\n\nThe film has preserved forever one of the great Broadway shows of all time forevermore. Reason enough to see it and whistle its happy tunes.",

It was really neat to see scenes of Bangkok over 40 years ago.\n\nLots of secret agents involved as well as some unexpected killing &amp; serious plot twists. I was just thinking &quot;hey, that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;d do in that situation&quot;. In so many films you see someone kill someone then leave that person&apos;s gun behind and you say to yourself that they&apos;re a real idiot, that you would have picked up the gun and searched the body, etc. This film has a lot of scenes where feel that the actors are acting intelligently.\n\nThis movie was originally in German and the English dubbing isn&apos;t bad at all.\n\nCheck it out!",

      "reviewBody": "Somewhat creepy horror movie with a supernatural edge to it, kind of a more horror oriented &quot;Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot;. Basically, a couple with their first child hires a nanny with a very dark and disturbing secret. She has chosen this baby for a reason and it is not to simply make it hers. As far as horror movies it is somewhat good, it has some gore, a couple of tense scenes and some nudity. However, if you watch the cut version of this movie the whole thing changes to the point almost all the scares and creepy stuff is taken out. They seem to completely edit over the first scene involving the baby taken to the tree, a scene later with the mother makes it out that the child survived and is safe and sound. The regular version is not so chipper. The ending is screwed up to as it ends earlier and they basically cut out the final scene. I realize that you want to cut out some stuff so you can show your movie on the happy time family network, but in the end you should not edit a movie to the point its plot and meaning change. So for an okay horror movie with some creepy scenes and such give this movie a shot, for a pedestrian movie with basically no scares and all creepiness removed try and find the cut version of the film.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie, directed by the two fairly inexperienced but obviously over-ambitious and talented French filmmakers Nicolas Alberny &amp; Jean Mach, quite possibly has the most original and avant-garde screenplay that I&apos;ve seen in many years. It&apos;s also another proof that you don&apos;t need a lot of money in order to make a film that is captivating and groundbreaking. &quot;8th Wonderland&quot; clearly cost next to nothing, but witty satirical ideas and superbly drawn characterizations don&apos;t require a large budget; just an intelligent and versatile crew and an enthusiast ensemble cast. The concept of &quot;8th Wonderland&quot; is simultaneously simple and genius. The title refers to the very first virtual nation in which people of all nationalities, religions and cultures unite in chat rooms to debate and vote on how they could improve ruling the outside world. And this time the members – citizens, if you will – of 8th Wonderland aren&apos;t loud-mouthed geeks hiding safely behind their computers, but devoted and resourceful academics that put their words into deeds as well. On a weekly basis, the citizens of 8th Wonderland democratically vote on an initiative during a referendum and subsequently appoint someone to execute the agreed actions. Whether it concerns placing condom vending machines in the Vatican, abduct world class soccer players to have them fabricate their own shoes amidst child laborers or boycotting the nuclear energy negotiations between Russia and Iran, the initiatives of &quot;8th Wonderland&quot; always make the world press and the virtual nation becomes immeasurably popular very fast. Parallel with the success, inevitably the first obstacles and issues arise as well. Frauds declaring themselves the mastermind behind 8th Wonderland, the safeguarding of loyal members after they risked their lives, dealing with the public opinion in case of false advertising or unpopular initiatives or feeling the burning breath of hunting FBI services in their neck. &quot;8th Wonderland&quot; definitely isn&apos;t an adrenalin-rushing thriller (most of the time it&apos;s just people talking straight into the camera, like they are in chat rooms) but it&apos;s nevertheless a compelling and politically engaging cinematic experiment that deserves all the praise and recommendation it can get! The characters are identifiable, the depiction of the media and public opinions are accurate and precise and the dialogs are stupendously written. Some of the discussed initiatives of the 8th Wonderland committee appear to be far-fetched and impossible to carry out, but there&apos;s always a logical clarification of what they do and a plausible breakdown of how they do it. The credibility of &quot;8th Wonderland&quot; largely relies on small but important and punctilious details, like for example the chatters occasionally mixing in words and swearing of their own native language, authentic news bulletin images and reports and members deciding to leave the group out of fear for retribution. The ensemble cast is marvelous and the computer engineered effects (for example, the illustration of a virtual chatting circle) are reasonably impressive; especially for computer illiterates like myself. Recommended in case you&apos;re on the lookout for something entirely new, refreshing and creative.",

      "reviewBody": "A filmed version of Guiseppe Verdi&apos;s opera. It&apos;s about a love affair between beautiful Violetta Valery (Teresa Stratas) and Alfredo Germont (Placido Domingo). Their love for each other is torn apart by his father--but she still loves him. It all leads to a tragic end.\n\nI saw this in a theatre back in 1982. They tried to play it like an opera. When I walked in the screen was covered by a red curtain (back in those days some of the older theaters still had curtains). As the lights went down the curtain parted and the film began. When the film ended, the curtains pulled back together and the lights came up. My audience applauded even after the lights were up. It gave the feeling of being at a live opera. That can&apos;t be recreated at your home but this film is still well worth seeing.\n\nDirector Franco Zeffirelli wisely did not film the opera as it is staged. He opened it up--this was set up for a film. Sequences take place outside and the inside sets are way too elaborate for an actual opera.\n\nThe costumes are beautiful and the sets are just stunning--full of color and light. Every moment of this picture is filled with beautiful imagery. It matches perfectly with the singing and the music which are just incredible. There&apos;s even a show-stopping matador dance half-way through! I&apos;ve never seen the opera but I&apos;ve heard this is very faithful and Stratas and Domingo have beautiful voices and also can act! The only negative here is that Domingo is way too old for his role...but that can be forgiven whenever he sings.\n\nThis was actually a sizable hit back in 1982. The same team got together a few years later and filmed &quot;Othello&quot;. Surprisingly that was TERRIBLE and is a textbook example of how NOT to do an opera! But this one is just great and a must-see. I give it a 10.",

      "name": "Wayne, Loren, and Brazzi; Lost in the Desert",
      "reviewBody": "Legend of the Lost is a film that could have been pretty good, but was destroyed because of the lack of chemistry between the leads, John Wayne and Sophia Loren. They don&apos;t relate or react to each other at all, and every &quot;intimate&quot; scene between them seems forced.\n\nOn the bright side, you have cinematographer Jack Cardiff&apos;s gorgeous on-location Technirama cinematography. The deserts of Libya never looked so good. And the script by Ben Hecht was actually quite good.\n\nBut Legend of the Lost is a member of an entire genre (or sub-genre) of films that might best be called &quot;Two-person Films.&quot; That is, the entire film centers on two or three characters that are somehow isolated from society and exist on their own in some desolate or deserted place. John Huston was a master of this genre, and his films The African Queen and Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison may very well be the best examples of the genre. Unfortunately for Legend of the Lost, this type of film mandates that there be great chemistry between the leads, or the whole film breaks down. Look at the great chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen and the great chemistry between Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison. This is where Legend of the Lost begins to come apart. Wayne was an actor who was legendary for his ability to relate to his leading ladies on screen. Throughout his six decade long career, he played opposite a wide variety of actresses (from Jean Arthur to Marlene Dietrich to Lauren Bacall to Katharine Hepburn) and was able to light up the screen with just about all of them. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the chemistry between him and Loren just wasn&apos;t there. In hindsight, of course, its easy enough to clamor for Maureen O&apos;Hara (who had done similar roles in the many &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; type adventure films she had spent most of the 40&apos;s doing), but I do give Wayne credit for taking a chance on the then almost unknown Loren. Unfortunately, things just didn&apos;t work out.\n\nVeteran director Henry Hathaway directed Legend of the Lost, and after its failure placed most of the blame on Loren, saying something to the effect that she was gorgeous to look at, but wasn&apos;t a very good actress. Although he might have had a point, Hathaway was also likely trying to deflect blame away from himself for the failure. The fact remains that he failed to overcome the casting problems that beset the film. And this is why Hathaway is remembered as a good, but not great director (and I say this as Hathaway&apos;s biggest fan). The great directors have the ability to elevate a film above script and casting problems, and Hathaway failed to do that here. Of course, Hathaway would say that given the material and genre it would have been very hard, if not impossible to do that here. And he may very well be right. In hindsight it might have been better to get John Huston himself to direct the film, though considering Wayne and Huston&apos;s equally disastrous joint project The Barbarian and the Geisha was still waiting in the future, perhaps its better Huston wasn&apos;t involved here.\n\nI&apos;ve always felt that Legend of the Lost was Batjac&apos;s attempt at a &quot;prestige picture.&quot; I think that Wayne was trying to impress the critics by producing an &quot;artsy&quot; film that would appeal to them, and when it failed, he went back to the familiar places and faces that he had found success with earlier in his career. It was probably a very wise decision on his part.\n\nLegend of the Lost is not for everyone. With different casting the film could have become a classic. As it is, it survives best as a remembrance of &quot;what might have been.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Especially one that sinks Titanic in special effects...\n\nThis is a remake of The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Before you jump on the bandwagon and start bashing it on this basis alone, keep it mind that the original film was not exactly a masterpiece. It was a film that sacrificed scientific reality to propel an inane plot, filled with one-dimensional characters and compensated for it with action-overload. Poseidon is exactly the same -- ridiculous plot, intrepid characters and big slice of adventure. What is different in this version is the masterful CGI. This is a perfect time to remake a film like this (much better than in 1972) -- just go overboard with special effects and no one will notice the flawed writing (which is basically a sketchbook mess).\n\nThis is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience. I&apos;ll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheeseball line (&quot;Where is the disco?&quot; &quot;Why, you feel like dancing now?&quot;), but I set its cringeworthy dialogue aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie. The giant tidal wave capsizing the luxury liner Poseidon would take care of that, leaving only a small group of people fighting to reach the top and get out. \n\nAnother thing, besides special effects, that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Make no mistake however, these characters are still dumb to the core, getting by on lucky circumstances, occasional heroic feats and conveniently appearing objects and hatches  you&apos;ve seen it all before, but damn, this is sensationally quality action.\n\nOverall, Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fast-paced as any action film you&apos;ll see. It features mind-numbing special effects, overdoses of excitement and just typical Wolfgang Peterson overkill. It definitely won&apos;t disappoint you if you&apos;re looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks. I&apos;d even happily sit through this experience again.\n\n6.5/10",

The macho men like Ajay Devagan and Vivek Oberoi also could not save the disaster.\n\nSome sequences clearly are copied from &quot;Final Destination&quot; and Taran Adarsh of Indiafm says these scenes are the best. I seriously don&apos;t understand how come he became a film critic. Tasteless cheap idiot.\n\nThe promos gave much hype to the movie with tigers and all the stuff. Clearly Soham concentrated more on the promos than the original film. Esha and Lara prove to be a waste. To be frank I don&apos;t find a single positive point about the movie except the marketing and pre release promotion.\n\nMy advice is not to watch the movie and waste your money.\n\nRating **.",

      "name": "A brilliantly executed mind-trick",
      "reviewBody": "I have always loved the Game. It sits right between The Truman Show and The Matrix as these 90&apos;s weird deconstructions of reality and sci-fi with a hint of social commentary on media. It was really the decade where TV and movies discovered the awesome power these new images had, and trying to reconcile their own moral hazard (spoiler alert: they did not). In The Game, Michael Douglas&apos; character has basically a feature film inserted in his life. With a rewatch there are some little details that stand out and you realize easily none of this would work for real. But it works for the audience and as such it works as a movie.\n\nI love this movie because it is a great mind-bending trick. The movie keeps the tension up throughout by jumping around whether the Game is real or not. Even in the third act, where there is maybe one switcheroo too many; you get that escalating tension that keeps you engaged.\n\nStructurally the movie may not be the most elegant. This tension escalates not really by anyone&apos;s actions but by design. But it is competent enough to let the talent shine. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and it&apos;s just a joy to watch. He basically plays Gordon Gekko again, with the self-important attitude but also the effortless charm. There is something to 90s Douglas that is frankly mesmerizing, because he offer such a large palette of characters. He can play the everyman gumshoe or the stonyhearted investment banker. And in the Game you can see that kind of transformation on-screen. You can see the veneer of civilization peel off and you&apos;re left with the unkempt hair Douglas: the most dangerous variant.\n\nReturning to the escalation of tension, it works that way also because the plot destroys Nicholas Van Orton&apos;s life in an escalating fashion. First he loses on his business deal, then his money/fortune, then his brother. Which culminates at the end of the movie: he is a broken man, which leads him to suicide. On the surface, the movie is very &quot;nineties ennui&quot; where it throws a business exec in suit and a briefcase in an action movie. The movie&apos;s internal logic is built around the fact that his life is very lame and predictable and he gets propelled into these action-movie set piece tropes. But underneath there is a more subtle message critical of the greed and the excess of the 80s. It is a repudiation of Gordon Gekko. It metaphorically kills Gordon Gekko, it throws him off the roof. And I believe the film&apos;s morals want to state that life&apos;s meaning lies elsewhere than monetary accumulation and wealth.\n\nThat is not to say that the movie is leading the masses to the barricades. It is first and foremost an action film, and as such a corporate product, yet it enjoys having a faceless corporation as &quot;the villain&quot;. But it is similar to Fight Club in that regard; it enjoys the subversive sub-text, without giving it too much credence. Nonetheless, it focuses way more on the mechanics of the plot: who is going where and why, rather than on the thematic elements. And for the most part it holds up as an action movie. And even if makes (forgettable) mistakes, you&apos;ll still want to rewatch it to see how well The Game was set-up, and what worked and what did not.",

      "reviewBody": "One of Clint Eastwood&apos;s more personal projects is Honkytonk Man where he both gets to do some singing and also to work with his then adolescent son Kyle. Apparently Kyle Eastwood has inherited the musical part of the Eastwood genes because he makes his living now as a jazz musician. I wonder if he ever jams with Woody Allen?\n\nClint did not exactly set the world on fire in his previous musical outing in Paint Your Wagon. But in Honky Tonk Man he&apos;s right in his element as a hard living country singer during the Depression trying to finally catch a break with the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nArriving at his sister&apos;s farm, Clint picks up both Kyle who is playing his nephew here and John McIntire who is Kyle&apos;s grandfather on his father&apos;s side and the three generations start out from Oklahoma to Nashville.\n\nEastwood has played some hard bitten characters in his films, but never one as dissolute as Red Stovall. His high living has brought him a case of tuberculosis, a lot more common and a lot less curable back in those days. In any event the peace and quiet of a sanitarium holds no interest for Clint. He&apos;d rather go out drinking and wenching than die of boredom in a sanitarium.\n\nOf course the odyssey of the three bring any number of adventures about life and love in their lives.\n\nJohn McIntire fits right in with the father and son Eastwoods. Also look for good performances by blues singer Linda Hopkins, young Alexa Kenan who hitches a ride with the travelers, and a cheating Barry Corbin who Clint collects from in the usual Eastwood manner. All and all a nice family project from the clan Eastwood.",

By chance, he sees himself locked in with the rioters and, to survive, he assumes, a new identity as a prisoner.\n\nAlthough the story is not especially original, the characters and the script are very good, the situation is completely believable within the Spanish social and jail context, and the end is not as predictable as you might expect. Moreover, the movie is unpretentious and fresh, which makes it even more enjoyable.\n\nThe acting is very good by all the cast, but especially by Luis Tosar as Malamadre, by Alberto Ammann as Juan Oliveras, and Antonio Resines as Prison officer Utrilla.\n\nA very entertaining Spanish thriller with very good acting, that won 8 Goyas (Spanish Oscars) in 2009.",

And his riding on the horses lasts for only about a day, but for that day, he and the girl who rode with them were required to do encores of their performances,\n\nAnyways....the story is cute. Yes, Mr. stubbs lives in the movie, but that is typical Disney giving a happy ending, and is to be expected. Watch it for fun, not because you want to compare it to the book.

      "reviewBody": "Wir sind die Nacht - We are the Night – CATCH IT (B+) A German movie deals with deals with a young woman who gets bitten by a female vampire and drawn into her world. She falls in love with a young police officer who investigates a murder case involving the vampires. Wir sind die Nacht took its inspiration from Carmilla rather than Dacula which was a wise decision and it made the movie really interesting and enjoyable. Wir sind die Nacht has a top notch production value and performance by all the leading actresses. Initially it looked like Karoline Herfurth playing Lena took her inspiration from Lisbeth Slander but once she is bitten and becomes Vampire she transforms into this gorgeous young girl. The transition is so drastic that a person like me who have not seen her previously in any movie was completely stunned. Nino Hoss is powerful as the vampire leader and I saw her recently in &quot;The Woman in Berlin&quot; so it was shocking to see her in such urban movie. Jennifer Ulrich is gorgeous; she literally looked like someone stole her from 1920s. Anna Fischer as vamp party girl brought her spunk to her spunky character. Max Riemelt is the hottest German actor alive, darn he sizzles on screen. His chemistry with Karoline Herfurth made the small love story really interesting. We are the Night is one of the best Vampire movie I have seen in recent years, its urban, chic and filled with strong performances. I would love to see a sequel for sure as the ending was ambiguous.",

      "reviewBody": "Three years after the Academy Award winning success of Rocky, Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as the heavyweight boxer in Rocky II, which he writes and directs this time around. Picking up right where the first film left off, Rocky II follows Rocky Balboa as he starts to adapt to family life after barely losing his match to Apollo Creed and then marrying his girlfriend Adrian. However, the adjustment to this new, much softer and simpler life isn&apos;t easy, especially while Apollo Creed continually harasses Rocky for a rematch, as he is hungry for the knockout, rather than just the winning score. Rocky must then make a choice, does he stay retired from boxing, or does he train to take on Apollo Creed once more? Rocky II, despite what die hard fans of the first film might say, is actually pretty good. It doesn&apos;t have the raw visceral emotion behind it that fueled the fire for the original but, as far as sequels go, it&apos;s really a decent film. It works really well as a continuation of Rocky&apos;s story, and it makes for a worthwhile addition to the first film. It&apos;s a lot of fun to see Stallone and Weathers reprise their roles as Rocky and Apollo, and getting an extra dosage of some great boxing is really exciting. Rocky II, while devoid of the visceral poetry of the first film, is pretty darn good.\n\nIt&apos;s not without a few problems of course. It&apos;s a much more watered down and predictable story than what we received in the first film. From the beginning we can see where the story is going and, while entertaining, it&apos;s not surprising and lacks the wow factor of the first film. The character of Rocky also changes a bit. He becomes softer in this film, and at times a caricature of the fabulous underdog protagonist Stallone established him as in the first film. He&apos;s a little goofy at times, and not as enjoyable as a character as he was in the first film. It&apos;s still great to see him get back in the ring, but it&apos;s not quite the same as the original.\n\nBut despite no wonder and power in the story, it&apos;s still really fun and Rocky II is plenty enjoyable to watch. If you liked the first film then I would definitely recommend watching the sequel, as it&apos;s just more great Rocky Balboa action, and a pleasant continuation of the story. It&apos;s not as fantastic as the first film, but worth two hours of your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn&apos;t a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO&apos;s, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it&apos;s nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I&apos;ll always give a place in my list of top movies and that&apos;s this &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I&apos;m still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.\n\nSomewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He&apos;s a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a &apos;volunteer&apos; to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called &apos;The Twelve Monkeys&apos; and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn&apos;t work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...\n\nWhat I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I&apos;m sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It&apos;s just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that&apos;s not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I&apos;m not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.\n\nEven after several viewings, I&apos;m still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that&apos;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, which wasn&apos;t bad, but didn&apos;t really convince me either. However, it&apos;s this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Flower of My Secret&quot; is from 1995, written and directed by Pedro Almodovar. It&apos;s not his best, but even a weaker Almodovar is better than just about anything out there.\n\nThe story begins strangely, with two youngish men, doctors, attempting to convince a woman to let her brain-dead son&apos;s organs be harvested. It turns out that it&apos;s some sort of training. Leo (Marisa Paredes) is waiting outside to ask her friend for help. She can&apos;t get her boots off and needs help.\n\nLeo&apos;s husband is in the military. She is a writer, a famous one, though not under her own name. She uses the name Amanda Gris. She goes to see the editor of a newspaper and asks to do a literature section for him. After he reads her unpublished novel, he hires her to write a story about Amanda Gris. Later on, he tells her that a film is being made and the story is similar to the novel. \n\nWhen Leo&apos;s husband Paco (Imanol Aris) shows up, it&apos;s obvious that though she has a great evening planned, he does not share her ardor. And he actually isn&apos;t on leave; he just has to leave, and he does. Leo is completely devastated.\n\nThis is a more serious Almodovar and, though Leo does have a nutty mother, a maid who dances, and the maid&apos;s son (a dancer/filmmaker), this isn&apos;t a film studded with Almodovar&apos;s usual assortment of eccentric characters and situations.\n\nAlmodovar ties up the theme with the training we see in the beginning -- acceptance and moving on. It&apos;s a lovely story of a woman unable to free herself from her life, in the same way she can&apos;t get those boots, but who ultimately breaks loose.\n\nThough it doesn&apos;t quite succeed, &quot;The Flower of My Secret&quot; is worth seeing.",

For sure, it&apos;s not comparable to movies like &apos;Boyz N the Hood&apos;, but it&apos;s a German movie, and really not a typical one. The editing is nice, a good and suitable sound track and at least nice acting.

      "reviewBody": "I managed to convince my friends to watch this movie because I told them the trailer was killer. But, boy was I proved wrong. The movie was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nSneak preview tickets are more expensive than normal movies. But I thought it was gonna be good so I paid for it. Only to end up watching a very bland, non-climactic movie with a very poorly written storyline. The only highlight of the show was seeing Taylor Lautner acting as a normal high school kid instead of a werewolf. But still, sad to say his acting had no charisma at all. His co-actress Lily Collins was no better, or maybe it was just her character that was so unlikeable, it made the whole movie really draggy. \n\nFirst quarter of the movie was still fine, but then it started to get cheesy.... There were so many loopholes in the movie and it just feels like the script and plot were very poorly planned. I sense sloppy work there. I left the theatre feeling so bewildered. So you might say:&quot;it&apos;s just a movie.... not everything makes sense&quot; But comparing to big action-spy movie names like Bourne, Mission Impossible and Die Hard which have delivered an excellent movie experiences which leaves you at the edge of your seat, Abduction feels more like a chick-flick packed with more action, or maybe a budget action film. It&apos;s very subtle.\n\nThe parts I enjoyed in the movie was the presence of veterans like Sigourney Weaver, Mario Bello and my favourite, Jason Isaacs who plays Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. They are always a joy to have and see in movies. \n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend watching this movie. Unless you just want to see Taylor Lautner, I would rather you give this show a miss. If you really want to go for it, don&apos;t get your hopes too high.",

I can only imagine what it must have been like seeing this in a theatre almost four decades ago.\n\nThe attention to detail is fantastic, and I enjoyed everything from the character set-up to the way the disaster unfolded. The very scale of this ambitious film is mindboggling. Paul Newman and Steve McQueen are excellent in their respective roles, both making credible and likable heroes.\n\n&apos;The Towering Inferno&apos; is a very detailed account of a skyscraper fire disaster. This is realistic and believable and the visual effects are incredible considering it was made way back in 1974. No CGI. Just practical effects, and real danger! This was a fascinating thrill ride!

      "reviewBody": "Have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of watching Russian films, especially fantasy. Both five years ago, when going on a bit of a quest to help me through an intensive period of studying, and now when re-visiting the fond happy memories during a much calmer period. Watching the films has given me great pleasure and has even been an education, getting acquainted with these stories and making one interested in learning Russian (a lovely language, though not easy to learn).\n\n&apos;Baba Yaga&apos; is not one of the standouts of the &quot;re-visiting&quot; period and it is not one of my favourite Russian fantasies. It is still very entertaining and charming and with a lot in its favour. There are enough imaginative touches to set it apart and the atmosphere has a sense of wonder, the surrealism being a big part of the appeal. It is another winner from Alexandr Rou, have not seen all his films but have liked all that have been seen. It will be a shame though that some viewers will be most familiar with him from &apos;Frosty&apos; (or &apos;Morozko&apos;), riffed on MST3K, which to me is not near as bad as indicated and not done justice by its dubbed version (like all the Russian fantasy films riffed).\n\nSome of the acting is a touch on the broad side.\n\nPlus some of the story is disjointed at times and not always as focused as it could.\n\nOn the other hand, enough of &apos;Baba Yaga&apos; is colourful and nicely designed with a good deal of atmosphere. The special effects, while not what one calls special, have a charm to them and are quite imaginatively used. The music is lush and atmospheric and Rou directs with an assured touch that never gets too serious or farcical. The writing flowed enough and made enough sense, with the story actually pretty simple even with a good deal thrown in.\n\nLiked the storytelling, which was fun and amiable with a sense of wonder and endearing quirkiness, and the viewer is fully immersed into a wonderfully bizarre world. The surrealism is done inventively and even though strange (in a captivating way) didn&apos;t to me become incoherent. The characters are immensely colourful in personality and it is difficult to not remember them. The acting is not the greatest but there was something oddly likeable in this respect, Baba Yaga is played very memorably with a mix of theatrical and sinister.\n\nIn conclusion, very nice. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Just because it&apos;s so close to a well structured plot, you can&apos;t forgive its burlesque story. Two butlers (played hilariously by Theo Lingen and Hans Moser) suspect themselves of being mass murderers at the same time, but due to completely different reasons. Susi Nicoletti and Josef Meinrad did better (and funnier) acting before and after that, but the script helps them to get away with their lack of spirit.",

      "reviewBody": "I shan&apos;t talk about the actors and the acting because to tell you the honest truth, the actors do not seem to be professional (and some not to be actors at all...but extras roped in) so its pretty dim in that department. However! I have a tendency to think that it gave the film some raw state procedure that helped to give it credence! The story is very simply told - it is after all a just, leave here and arrive there; whilst catching up with old friends and meeting new ones as you hitchhike to a Temple. The only the &quot;but&quot; to the tale is there is a Tiger cub as your sidekick that you rescued from poachers and. They are extremely devoid of anything needed to make a good villain.\n\nIts a slow paced film but its just had that little something to it that kept me watching it; rather than switching it off. I hadn&apos;t been expecting much of it to start with so it was a sneaky surprise for me. I absolutely did notice the blatant mistakes in replacing the Tiger cubs used throughout the film. The small ones looked very similar (unless you know how to read the different stripes all Tigers have; none had the same pattern markings) but the last one used was nearly twice the size in the space of a few days to a weeks length of time.",

      "reviewBody": "In the Second World War, Colonel Dragoljub Mihailovic did form a Chetnik movement for a guerrilla war against the Germans, but that movement very quickly became treacherous due to opposing conceptions of resistance and an ideological split with the partisans.\n\nOn 19 September 1941, Mihailovic met with Josip Broz Tito in the village of Struganik to discuss an alliance between the Partisans and the Chetniks, but the negotiations failed due to major differences in the goals of their movements. Tito advocated a broad joint offensive, while Mihailovic believed that the uprising was dangerous and started too soon and was afraid that it would trigger major reprisals. Tito and Mihailovic met again on 27 October 1941 in the village of Brajici near Ravna Gora to try once more to reach an agreement, but they agreed only on secondary issues. Immediately after the meeting, Mihailovic began preparations for an attack on the partisans, but he postponed it only because of a lack of weapons. Mihailovic told the Yugoslan Government in Exile that the capture of Uzice, where the weapons factory was located, was necessary to prevent the strengthening of the communists. Through his representative in Belgrade, Colonel Branislav Pantic, on 28 October 1941, Mihailovic contacted the president of the treacherous government, General Milan Nedic, and the next day with the German officer Josef Matl, with an offer to fight together against the partisans in exchange for weapons. This offer was conveyed to General Franz Böhme, the head of the Military Administration in Serbia, and the Germans offered a meeting for November 3rd 1941. In the meantime, the Chetniks attacked the partisans in Uzice, Ivanjica, Cacak, Gornji Milanovac and other places of free territory, the first in the enslaved Europe at the time, on the night between 31 October and 1 November 1941, but they were repulsed. Then, in the village of Slovac, about 350 partisans captured by the Chetniks were handed over to the Germans. This attack started the civil war in Serbia. Because of this, on November 3, 1941, Mihailovic postponed the meeting with the German officers until 11 November 1941. At the meeting in the village of Divci, which was led by Mihailovic and lieutenant colonel Rudolf Kogard, Mihailovic assured the Germans that his intention &quot;was not to fight against the occupiers&quot; and that &quot;he never made a sincere agreement with the communists, because they do not care about the people. They are led by foreigners who are not Serbs...&quot; giving the Germans incorrect information. At the meeting, Mihailovic proposed that the Germans help him in his fight against the partisans and that this cooperation remain hidden from the Serbian people, but the agreement was not reached because the Germans demanded the complete surrender of the Chetniks and believed that the Chetniks would attack them despite Mihailovic&apos;s offer.\n\nMihailovic carefully hid the negotiations with the Germans from the Yugoslav Government in Exile, as well as from the British and their representative Duane Tyrell Hudson, who was in Mijalovic&apos;s military staff at the time of the meeting in Divci. Having failed to defeat the Chetniks, faced with reports that the British considered Mihailovic to be the leader of the resistance and under pressure from the German offensive, Tito once again offered negotiations to Mihailovic, which led to negotiations and a subsequent armistice on 20 or 21 November 1941. Tito and Mihailovic had their last telephone conversation on 28 November 1941. Tito declared that he would defend himself against the Germans, while Mihailovic declared that he would hide.\n\nWith Mihailovic&apos;s approval, the commanders of his detachments decided on November 20 to join the legalized Chetniks under the command of General Nedic, in order to be able to fight against the partisans without fear of the Germans and to avoid compromising Mihailovic in the eyes of the British. About 2,000 to 3,000 Chetniks joined the army of Nedic&apos;s regime. Legalization enabled the Chetniks to receive a salary and alibi from the Quisling government, while Nedic received more soldiers to fight against the communists under the command of the Germans.\n\nApart from that, all the films in which the original languages, related to the place and time of the event, are not used, in this case Serbian-Croatian and German, are worthless regardless of their artistic achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "What can you expect from a Swedish comedy that is called &quot;Jalla! Jalla!&quot; and that has been made with an unknown cast by a man you&apos;ve never heard of before? Quite a lot as this movie proves. It&apos;s subject certainly isn&apos;t one of the easiest, but Josef Fares made a good movie out of it.\n\nDon&apos;t ask me what &quot;Jalla! Jalla!&quot; stands for, because I really don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t even know if it is Arabic or Swedish (I guess the first). But what I do know is that this is a movie about Roro a man from Lebanese origin who works as a park attendant with his best friend Måns. Roro has a Swedish girlfriend, something that he doesn&apos;t want his parents to know , and is forced to marry a Lebanese/Swedish girl. He likes her but doesn&apos;t love her, but decides to marry her anyway to help her, because if she doesn&apos;t marry, her brother will send her back to Lebanon to their parents. Måns has entirely different problems. He has a relationship too, but because he&apos;s having potency problems, his relationships isn&apos;t exactly going very well. While Måns tries to fix his problem, using all kinds of methods, Roro has to try to keep up appearances while stalling the wedding plans and maintaining the relationship with his unknowing girlfriend.\n\nI must say that I didn&apos;t expect all that much about this movie. Normally a movie about mixed relationships or other multi-cultural society problems tends to get incredibly preachy. But not this movie, instead of showing how bad and racist the &apos;white man&apos; is and how nice the &apos;black man&apos;, this movie has made a comedy out of it. And it works. The characters and the situations that they get in are believable, but more important also incredibly funny.\n\nThe acting too was very nice. I had never heard of any of the actors before, but I must say that they all did a very nice job. Most surprising is probably that most of them has never played in any other movie before or since this one. Does that mean that these aren&apos;t professional actors? I don&apos;t know, but I sure hope to see them again soon, because I really had a very good time with this movie and I can&apos;t remember being annoyed by it once. That&apos;s also the reason why I give this movie at least a 7.5/10.",

It is the story of a group of people in despair (Mario with a failed restaurant and three brothers with a breeding of ostriches near Cecina) who casually meet together. Mario is the name of a man, who could save the breeding from the end and when the brothers meet the failed Mario (instead of the rich) at the station, they believe he is their savior. Mario would like to explain, but when he finds love and friendship in that big and fool family, he prefers to continue his lie. At the end of the Christmas night, they&apos;ll discover the truth, but the end will be happy and beautiful. It&apos;s a tender comedy, which remembers other masterpieces of Italian cinema at his best like &quot;Miracolo a Milano&quot;. It&apos;s a story of a friendship (even if there&apos;s interest behind their kindness) with a great Francesco Paolantoni. A moment to remember is the one &quot;A Natale non si soffre più!&quot; (At Christmas, we won&apos;t suffer anymore!). Fantastic: 10 out of 10.",

That&apos;s saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous...trite. The voice acting is atrocious, Too cute sounding. The humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.\n\nIt gets a 2 only because of it&apos;s OK 3-D visuals. Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We&apos;ve seen much better in the past. I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes. While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.\n\nI will say this though, It had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for the record my son wasn&apos;t too crazy about it either. Bad movie.",

If you are a fan of Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc you have probably also thought of some scenes you would like to see. For me this movie comes very close. The CGI effects can only be described as awesome. Every scene breathes the love of the staff for details. Especially the battle scenes are outstanding and give every Star Wars movie a run for its money. The plot is also masterly constructed. The tension builds up in the first twenty minutes or so and reaches several peaks after that. The story has a great tongue-in-cheek attitude. The characters are only slightly exaggerated compared to their respective originals which keeps them from getting on your nerves too fast. Fortunately the actors avoid overacting - which impressed me as this is still a fan movie after all. The only drawback is that the audio is Finish with English sub-titles. But what the heck: Hearing the tone of Pirk&apos;s derogatory remarks is compensation enough.",

But as that is not the case I can only say: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?! How did this movie ever get made? I love bad movies...but this is something beyond anything I&apos;ve ever seen. THat it&apos;s from 1996 is also something I cannot believe. Who in their right mind joins a project like this? The biggest mystery in this movie is how the hell someone authorized it and got actors to actually play in it (of course..not all of them seem to do so) This is just ...a huge mystery of a film. I thank MST3K for showing it to me. It&apos;s really a gem amongst hugely crappy films. It&apos;s nice to see how bad a movie actually can get. Someone should really have made documentary about this movie and interviewed the people behind it. It would really solve one of the worlds biggest mysteries. Even the title of the movie is totally messed up. It should be &quot;MERLIN&apos;S SHOP OF KILLER TOYS&quot; But..oh that would probably make it seem more predictable...uhm?",

And, naturally, well crafted. La Rochelle is beautifully and thoroughly depicted here.\n\nPlease note the astounding performance of Georgette Anys as &quot;Titine Babin&quot;. You may remember her as little more than a silhouette, for instance in two great Duvivier&apos;s works, &quot;Sous le ciel de Paris&quot; and &quot;La fête à Henriette&quot;. In &quot;Le sang à la tête&quot;, she has a part to play, a real one though short, and Mme Anys can inhabit it with an impressive strength.",

      "reviewBody": "Last night I woke up at 8.30 in the night after sleeping for like 6 years at a stretch after the overnight stay me and my friends had. 9 PM. On air is &quot;Khosla Ka Ghosla&quot;. Now I really wanted to watch that movie when it was released but just didn&apos;t had the time to and right now, I wasn&apos;t in the mood for it but since nothing else on TV was worth a watch, I decided to see the film.\n\nAfter a while I realized that 40 minutes had gone by and not for one moment did I feel that KKG had a scene so far which was boring or unnecessary. KKG is truly gripping. It sucks you into it and you&apos;ll start getting concerned about Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher). Khosla is a very innocent middle-class service man who gets a plot of land from Kishan Khurana (Boman Irani) out of his life-savings, a lump amount of 30 lacs but things get terrible when Khurana doesn&apos;t exactly let Khosla get the land until Khosla would pay Khurana another 10-15 lacs.\n\nAs much as I would love to say that Khosla Ka Ghosla was a movie which belonged to Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, I cannot deny that it belonged to the other artists as well. What I like so much about Khosla Ka Ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists in it except Boman Irani &amp; Anupam Kher and if it did, maybe it would have lost its simplicity. Anupam Kher has been doing really lesser number of roles as compared to what he used to in the 90s but after Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, Kya Kool Hain Hum and Rang De Basanti, Kher almost steals the show again. Khosla Ka Ghosla is very very realistic and that is its USP. Of course there are a few little flaws in the script but that does not stop KKG from becoming an entertaining ride without moving away from the realistic world. The brand of humour used in the movie is simple and enjoyable and one thing which I liked very much about this film is its characterization, I cannot deny that I liked every character present in the movie and it felt that they were straight out of someone&apos;s lives. Although Khurana and his assistant reminded me of Lucky Singh &amp; Kuku in Lage Raho Munnabhai bit, basically because of the role they played.\n\nBoman and Anupam of course do play the parts beautifully but one performance which I liked a lot was that was Bappu&apos;s (Navin Nischol). Now what Bappu is doing in the film, I cannot say because I feel that would give out a part of the story. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak come together again after they did once in Jism. Ranvir as Anupam&apos;s elder son and Vinay as the guy whom Boman had betrayed play their parts with ease and rock it. Tara Sharma&apos;s accent is weird but I liked her here and the director gets credit for that. Parween Dabas too... actually its not the actors that are there but the characters. Such is the magic of débutante director Dibakar Banerjee and writer Jaideep Sahani. Full marks to the director who&apos;s earned my respect.\n\nThe music by composers Bapi, Tutul and Dhruv too is great. &quot;Chakk De Phadde&quot; sung by Kailesh Kher which is also the OST of the movie is nice and totally in mood of the film. The other tracks too offer great help in carrying the story forward.\n\nWhen Anupam Kher had said that this is a tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee&apos;s film-making style, I&apos;m sure he truly meant it. Khosla Ka Ghosla is simple, innocent, realistic and entertaining. Go watch it if you want to see a quality film. Much better than the Karan Johar or Rakesh Roshan flicks which are recognised by Filmfare, not for their creativity but commercial success. Khosla Ka Ghosla made my mood. Three cheers to the movie! 7.5/10 from http://muviegeek.blogspot.com",

This is the country of complete oppression. In 1960&apos;s we saw North Korea as a poor but hopeful country. In fact, many Koreans living in Japan returned to North Korea to join the building of &quot;paradise on earth&quot;. But since then, the country kept going downward. Nowadays they are isolated at the dead end. The reason why such country still survives is that by giving people at the power side extreme privilege, so that they want to keep the regime made of fictions.\n\nIn such a country there is a family of the father, once a hero of soccer team, and his loving wife, and their son who likes soccer too. The atmosphere of the family which is poor but tied with love emphasizes how loveless the country is.\n\nIn fact, looking at the officials of the camp or boarder security, I could not help wondering if it is possible for the same human being become arrogant and cruel like this. I feel some sense of impotence, because I can do nothing to the situation close to my country.\n\nThis movie focuses on the fate of a family. This is beyond a propaganda movie to accuse North Korea, nor to glamorize the rescue group. This portrays the dignity of human being.",

      "reviewBody": "Often inspiring biographical documentary about Bob Forrest, lead singer and songwriter for the late 80s LA critical darling Thelonius Monster and his battle with addiction, leading him to become an outspoken and passionate advocate for helping get people off drugs. \n\nIt&apos;s good to see a drugs and rock &apos;n&apos; roll documentary that shows someone surviving, coming out the other side, and not only learning from his plunge, but using his knowledge of suffering to help others, There&apos;s some real inventiveness amidst the talking heads: animation, both claymation and line drawings help flesh out Bob&apos;s experiences. Interviews with Bob&apos;s friends and band mates from the late 80s L. A. inde rock/punk scene including Flea, Anthony Kiedis, Courtney Love let us in to both Bob&apos;s bravery, and what a total jerk he was when drugs and anger ruled his life. \n\nYet, for all it&apos;s power, there&apos;s something a little too neat about the documentary. Or maybe it&apos;s that it tries to cover too much – Bob&apos;s whole musical career from the very start, his slow rise to rock semi-stardom to his collapse into selling out, his childhood, the whole arc of his drug addiction, from his obsession to the idea of drugs as a depressed young guy, to working as a dishwasher when he was finally trying to get clean, and then his whole life post drugs, from being lost in the wilderness, to discovering his voice as a drug counselor and advocate, and re-discovering his love of playing music, not to be a star, but for the joy of it. That&apos;s a lot to jam into an 87 minute documentary, and sometimes it feels like important details are being skipped over. It can also fall into making Bob too much of a saint, there&apos;s sort of a fan- boy air to it, For all those around him being willing to talk about how awful Bob was at his addicted low, there&apos;s a little too much of the hagiography to the current version of Bob, a man I suspect is still more complex, maybe even difficult than the film lets on.",

Produced originally by Schongerfilm, it&apos;s a modest but good adaptation of the Grimm brothers story. The dubbing may be out of sync (as was usually the case in Childhood Productions imports) but the voices were well chosen, and a truly beautiful musical score by Milton Delugg was added. The production values are minimalist, to say the least, but otherwise it&apos;s enjoyable. Schongerfilm produced the wonderful &quot;Snow White&quot; also acquired by Childhood for American release. Most of these had original soundtrack albums issued at the time which are now collector&apos;s items.",

      "reviewBody": "I laughed when I came on here and saw a handful of sheepish shoegazers reviewing this movie. They called it &apos;propaganda&apos;, they called it a &apos;Conservative brainwashing tool.&apos; Let&apos;s be honest for a few minutes. Hollywood is riddled with mind-numbingly moronic &apos;actors&apos; who tell you how to feel, tell you how to spend your money, tell you how to vote, and tell you how you should live your life. Honestly, how can you 16 year old latte lappers truthfully view this film as &apos;propaganda&apos;? It just makes me laugh.\n\nAnyway, this film was a nice breath of fresh air. I&apos;m sick of Sean Penn pouring his whining little do-nothing tears all over the television set. I&apos;m sick of Opera sitting on her $6,000 white sofa while crying about every low-life druggy that plops onto the seat next to her. I&apos;m sick of the ALCU grave diggers scouring the globe and looking for the next person who says the word &apos;black&apos; or spills coffee on their lap. I&apos;m sick of Rosie Odonnell spraying bacon bits out of her loud mouth while she thinks she&apos;s daytime TVs answer to all the world&apos;s problems. Like I said, this film was a breath of fresh air.\n\nWatching this film I realized that modern day America has no General Patton, we have no war hero JFK, we have no liberty loving George Washington. Modern day America needs public officials that know the price of freedom...now I know some of you leftist Bolsheviks will laugh at that, but that&apos;s only to your demise. Billions of people around the world are suffering at the hands of brutal and power hungry dictators...yet you sit behind your computer, posting your inane blogs, and believing all the answers can be solved with a click of a mouse and a hug. Get a grip on reality and stop living in Candy Land.\n\n-AZ3 USN",

Just before they leave Freddy (Freddy Quinn) buys a good luck bottle from an old sailor and soon he and his pals Hein (Gunnar &quot;Thor&quot; Möler) and Hannes (Ralf Wolter) believe their fortune really has taken a turn for the better. Only the audience is aware of the real reasons behind their incredible good luck. They soon arrive on a &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; like island where the most is made of the colourful locations in Cinemascope format and the photography is beautiful without being flashy. \n\nApart from lot of natives dancing, the three sailors do a &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; style song and dance number. However they are limited to marching around and a clumsy interpretation of the Can Can. Hannes takes the bottle back to the mainland to woo the woman of his dreams while Freddy relies on his own charm (and singing voice) to serenade a local girl named Mara (who looks pretty European to me). The plot gets more complicated when some crooks show interest in the treasure of the cabin and Hein gets a mysterious illness. At the same time the volcanoes on the island are showing signs of life, so the islanders start jumping off a giant wicker man attached to bungee cord that are a bit too long. \n\nFreddy obviously has to get the good luck bottle back but even his boat is attacked by spearthrowers. In a sequence straight out of Ian Fleming, Freddy dumps petroleum in the river and lights it.  These scenes also feature music by Lothar Olias that sounds very similar to John Barry&apos;s 007 scores, the first of which was being shot around the same time on another island. Eventually all loose ends are neatly tied up by Freddy and he serenades his love one last time with the song of the South Sea the title refers to. It turns out to be none other than &quot;Alo-Ahe&quot;\n\n7 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "I saw that movie many years ago in a Quebec cable channel. When I watched it, on my opinion, it came to me that money rules power, power rules the law, the law sets the rules, and the rules are full of corruption...\n\nMob boss and contractor Padovani (Jean Lajeunesse) invites many top guests, including a Quebec MP, the mayor of Montreal (Rene Caron) in his home for a reception to celebrate the opening of the Trans-Quebec highway (in reality the Ville Marie Highway in Montreal...). Women, including the sultry and sexy mistress of Padovani (Celine Lomez) are there to accompany the men or entertain them (mostly in a sexy way...). Downstairs, bodyguards and police agents protecting those VIPS are playing pool or having a drink, among these a hitman (troubling Gabriel Arcand, Denys&apos;s brother...) waiting for a next hit, but might be close to get a new &quot;contract&quot;...\n\nBut two incidents occured: an upcoming protest by a group, angry that their houses were demolished to make place for the highway, is stated to disturb the inauguration... And Padovani&apos;s ex-wife, Réjeanne (excellent Luce Guilbeault) wants to come back into her ex&apos;s life. The latter is reluctant because she went away with a rival Jewish mob boss. Suspecting she&apos;s too dangerous, he must face a decision... And an accidental tip from paparazzi journalists roaming in the property (and stopped by the rowdy security...) might give him a key to shut up the upcoming protest stated for the opening day...\n\nThis movie, done by the excellent Denys Arcand (the mastermind behind Jesus of Montreal, the Decline of the American Empire and the latest hit The Barbarian Invasions...), is well written though slow, performances are excellent, and scary too: a good example of how politics and corruption, represented by organized crime, even cops and hitmen are mingling together, while their bosses are celebrating upstairs their latest coup, paid mostly by taxpayers and Mob greed...\n\nAn entertaining movie, filled with reals images at the end of the movie of the housing demolition that occured when they built the real highway (symbolic that rich power is killing the poor and desperate souls...)",

Obviously intended as a propaganda piece, it depicts an airfield in the eastern Soviet Union that comes into conflict with the Japanese. The characters come across as cartoonish and it&apos;s a predictable movie. It was probably a movie that Stalin wanted them to make. Now that I think of it, I should have spent the whole time riffing the movie like on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.\n\nNo, it&apos;s not a terrible movie. Just overacted and generally corny. Might be of interest to film buffs, but not to anyone else.",

      "reviewBody": "Growing up together as social outcasts with only each other for company, twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle become very close. This closeness becomes more like them both sharing one self in two bodies as they study in the same area and eventually become experts in the field of gynaecology. They share everything and few can tell them apart; an arrangement that works well until Beverly falls for a patient (Claire Niveau) and finds that there are things he doesn&apos;t want to share with Elliot. As Bev confronts the idea of them being separate for the first time ever, he starts to fall apart mentally and, when Elliot tries to reach out and help him he too is drawn into confusion over identity and an inability to find where one of them stops and the other starts.\n\nBeing a Cronenberg film I knew to expect body horror and, shall I say, an &apos;unusual&apos; theme and in many ways the film delivered in spades but in a much more cerebral fashion. The plot is not easy to explain but it is a totally convincing breakdown of both Elliot and Beverly as they lose contact with the lines between them (if the lines ever really existed). Of course it is rather extreme but it is relentlessly interesting in terms of the script and the characters. The gynaecological part of the film allows Cronenberg to explore his more usual body horror stuff but this all came second to the much more interesting material that exists in the script. Cronenberg appears to be as fascinated as me by the characters and he directs with a cold eye, letting the creepy atmosphere come from not only the story but every shot, every set and every performance; not only this but this is one of his more accessible films without losing much of what makes Cronenberg Cronenberg.\n\nOf course a massive part of the film working is two perfect performances from Jeremy Irons, who I have not seen better in any other films. Using special effects as well as the old &apos;over the shoulder&apos; technique, Irons is able to convincingly be on screen in two characters at the same time, but it is not the shot framing that makes it convincingly two characters, it is Irons&apos; performance that does that. His Beverly is so feeble and has a convincing breakdown; while his Elliot appears much more together but suffers in a different way from the same struggle. Obviously being identical, it is due to Irons that the two characters come across so very different but yet seem just like the same person. In every little scene he manages to stay in character no matter what  it&apos;s hard for me to describe, you need to really see it for yourself. Bujold is good in support early on but, as the twins&apos; story gets more complex, her characters feels a bit intrusive and uninteresting, but generally she is good. However, to talk about anyone beyond this is to suggest there is room for them in the film  there isn&apos;t. Instead the film is pretty much dominated by two people  and they are both Jeremy Irons, producing two great performances that were vital for the film to work.\n\nOverall this may be a little too weird for some viewers but many more will find it to be one of their favourite Cronenberg films on the basis that it has the qualities that makes him him but is also a lot more accessible as well. The body horror is there in the background but it is the psychological scarring and confusion that is of much more interest; the script is great even if the plot goes to the usual Cronenberg excesses but it is two perfect performances by Irons that makes it all come together in a compelling and interesting film."

Even more of a delightful surprise was the cameo appearance by General Burkhalter as a South Sea island chief!! The songs weren&apos;t bad, either. * &quot;The Merry-Go-Run-Around&quot; is probably my second-favorite song of Bob&apos;s. &quot;Silver Bells&quot; and &quot;Thanks for the Memories&quot; naturally tie for first-place.* With Bob having died this past Sunday, nostalgia channels like AMC and TCM will no doubt include this, and all his other films, in some kind of marathon movie memorial. *Which they really should have done BACK ON HIS CENTENNIAL!* Oh, well. Thanks to you, Bob, for all my merry, mirth-filled memories."

Some scenes maybe are a bit to violent for younger children, for example when the &quot;bad guys&quot; are menacing the &quot;good guy&quot; hurting his cats, it can&apos;t be clearly seen that in fact they are NOT doing any harm to the kitten.\n\nI can&apos;t find any production notes about this film, so I don&apos;t have any idea if during this production animals have been harmed. At least I hope they didn&apos;t, because I&apos;d love to see this movie again but without having a bad conscience.\n\nAnother recommendation to the parents: After watching &quot;The Little Cat&quot;, lots of children want to have a little cat of their own. But please: Don&apos;t get one if you are not REALLY SURE you want to have one. Then you don&apos;t have to throw it away like garbage when the children are tired of playing with it and don&apos;t want to have it anymore."

I&apos;m glad I watched it, despite possibly being scarred for life. &quot;What doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stranger&quot;. I think they did a fantastic job of doing a terrible job, and the performances were pretty disturbingly well done for the most part, especially the main...guy. I think my favorite part might be the &quot;continuity&quot; bit, which is funny because it was one of the least over-the-top funny moments...for this movie. I was also really disturbed by the number of physically attractive actors in this film considering the bizarre, messed and/or stupid characters they played. It made me uncomfortable in a good/bad/confusing way, which I felt ultimately added to the specatacle.",

The whole time you are thinking &quot;where is this movie going to?&quot; It was a big mystery, but with a happy ending. The Ukranian girl is the most mysterious person in the movie, the only reason I wanted to keep watching was because of curiosity what would happen to her. My favorite character was at first Laura, because she was so cute, but later on in the movie she turns out to be quite annoying. Anyway, I&apos;ve seen better.",

The acting is terrible. THe lead role reminded me of an 8th grade play.Actually the whole movie reminded me of an 8th grade play.Last but not least. SHorty doing the voice over for Hercules was just disgusting. NOt everyone can do voice over and you do need some acting skills to do it. His vocal tone stayed the same no matter what situation. No excitement at all.It sounded like shorty was doing the voice over in the bathroom. I warn all of the people in this world. Do not watch unless your half asleep.

      "reviewBody": "It took me a whole day to watch the 4 disc box of Angel of Death 2. Due the reason that the first part was Andreas first success he made this sequel, but to be honest and I said it before, it has nothing to do with part 1. Okay, he uses some shots from the first part but it isn&apos;t in the same context as in part one. He in fact re edited the shots. Of course Andreas is in this flick too as is the man he adores, Jess Franco. The difference with part one is that there is gore available only you have to wait until the last half hour of the flick. But it is worth waiting for. All made by his friend Olaf Ittenbach. As always he make use of the same actors as in his other movies, like Franco and Lina Romay. Just of the record, when you watch the interview on the extra disc with Romay you can notice it is at the office of X Rated Kult. And just have a close look, some OOP DVD&apos;s are available in his office. The acting is believable and much better then part one, the editing and score is better. Anyway, the limited box I own has 3 versions of this flick. Frauengefangnis 4: ungekurzte version. It clocks in at 88 minutes no English subs, German language. This is the part that you will find in the shops. The gore is intact, the movie starts immediately with a view over the prison island. The nudity is intact. No more no less just say, the cut version available all over the world. Women behind bars 4: director&apos;s cut. This one clocks in at 105 minutes and is the only version with English subs. It is also the only version with an alternative opening. This version is hard to get because the alternative opening has some XXX features. A girl hitch hike and is picked up by a weirdo. In fact this opening has nothing to do with the movie except that the girl appears later on the prison island. Of course the guy take a short cut into the woods and she has to give him head. all filmed on screen facial cuming included. Further this version has the explicit nudity/lesbo scene&apos;s all shown. This is the XXX version only available at specialised shops. Further on the gore is intact. Angel of death 2: rohschnittversion. This version has the same opening as the cut version and clocks in at 124 minutes. The gore is available uncut but the nudity/lesbo scene&apos;s are more explicit and there are other lesbo scene&apos;s available not seen in the other versions. \n\nThis film, as the title says refer to those 70&apos;s women behind bar exploitation/grindhouse flicks combined with an ode at the Ilsa flicks. Only watch it if you can take real gore and are not offended by the XXX nudity.",

The opera sequence with HELEN JEPSON is well done--including a lovely version of &quot;Siempre Libre&quot;; EDGAR BERGEN and CHARLIE McCARTHY are pros in a few amusing sketches; KENNY BAKER does a professional job on songs like &quot;Love Walked Right In&quot;; VERA ZORINA adds some dancing magic and ANDREA LEEDS lends her bland presence to the role of a naive young girl asked to give ADOLPHE MENJOU pointers on what the public wants. Leeds looks an awful lot like either Donna Reed or Olivia de Havilland in her close-ups.\n\nADOLPHE MENJOU, too, is professional enough as the producer foolish enough to get ideas from a romantic young girl so he can produce the right kind of movie. Too bad Goldwyn didn&apos;t get some advice from good script-writers on how to stage this sort of thing.\n\nSumming up: Noteworthy only for the color cinematography and some of the talented bits, but the script is full of dull clichés, lifeless and unbelievable. I found Bergen and McCarthy gave the film its most enjoyable moments.",

      "reviewBody": "Mohabbatein is the second directorial of aditya chopra after ddlj. Narayan Shankar (Big b) is a strict authoritarian running a school named gurukul with three rules- parampara,prateestha, anushasan. Meaning only focus on studies. Enters into the school raj aryan(srk), as a violin teacher who focuses on everyone to love. This irks narayan shankar and later it is revealed that raj was a former student of gurukul thrown out by shankar for loving his daughter meghna(aishwarya rai) who committed suicide after that. Raj has entered here to take revenge on shankar by turning his disciplinary school with love and romance. The story also focuses on 3 students of gurukul- Vicky (uday chopra), sameer(jugal hansraj) and karan(Jimmy shergill). Vicky falls in love with the neighboring school student ishika(shamita shetty), sameer is in love with his childhood friend sanjana(kim sharma) and karan falls in love with a young widow kiran(preethi jhangiani). Rest of the movie is how raj helps these boys and whether he could defeat narayan shankar or not. Highlight of this film is the faceoff of two big superstars itself. After several failures as a lead actor in 90s, bachchan decided to shed all his superstar image and become into a character actor through this film. Mohabbatein started a new phase for big b as what we see him today. SRK&apos;s raj is overly romantic. Both of their combination scenes are handled well. Among the three love stories, my favorite one is karan and kiran&apos;s only. Vicky and ishika one is childish and sameer sanjana one is meh. Today, none of the female lead actress could shine in Bollywood and in males only Jimmy is today a successful actor. There is also one side track of anupam kher and archana puran singh as the cliché sardar which is forgettable. Songs look good on screen. Production values of yrf are grand. But the movie is too long and far too unrealistic. On the whole, mohabbatein can be enjoyed if you ignore its unrealistic plot and if you are a big fan of these superstars.",

Visually he is certainly among the best in the business, not only in Hong Kong, both as a director and a producer. The Once upon a time in China and Chinese ghost story series being particularly impressive examples of his prowess.\n\nButterfly Murders already contains many of his future hallmarks, especially in the imaginative cinematography. It&apos;s basically a blend of Kung Fu action and Giallo which I had yet to see. As such it is not fully successful. The visuals are quite amazing, very distinct and cinematic. They foreshadow both his own career and the new trajectory of Hong Kong cinema at the nadier of the more theatrical Shaw brothers productions. The limited setting is suspenseful and well utilized. The mystery story setup is also quite intriguing at first, but the conclusion left a few things left to be desired. The same goes for the fight scenes, which aren&apos;t done badly by any means but lack the fluency, creativity and splendor you associate with Tsui Hark. It appears he had yet to learn to marry the hypnotic beauty of his narrative shots with his action shots.\n\nIt&apos;s an entertaining romp throughout, so I don&apos;t want to come down on it too harshly, but it should or at least could have crescendoed to a true classic. I usually wouldn&apos;t suggest such a thing, but maybe this material could be made to shine with a remake by the master himself.",

Still, he&apos;s able to give it all that he&apos;s got like in his previous films, and it&apos;s nice seeing that he went down still a tough guy. The rest of the movie proves to be just as surprisingly enjoyable. It does go on too long (125 minutes!), and there is not as much action as you may be expecting. But the drama portion of the movie proves to be compelling, and the few action scenes there are turn out to be exceedingly well done. Certainly no masterpiece, but it is entertaining. Fans of Norris and/or Marvin, however, should be warned that the two of them don&apos;t appear in as much of the movie as they may be expecting."

      "name": "A Film About the Destructiveness of Sex Obsession",
      "reviewBody": "I think most people don&apos;t understand this movie. This is not a love story, at least not in the conventional sense. &quot;9 1/2 weeks&quot; is about sexual desire and intimate sensuality run amok and becoming the monopolizing forces in a relationship, and the ultimate demise of that relationship as a result. Certainly the physical pleasures and sensuality of sex are aspects that make a relationship fulfilling and gratifying but they are not the only facets. A relationship purely based on sexual desire is doomed to failure. At first it seems like a game, but later on the intensity is too much for the relationship to withstand, largely because if love and caring are sacrificed for the sex, it will die.\n\nYou almost couldn&apos;t find more suitable casting than Mickey Roarke and Kim Bassinger. Roarke plays John, a sexually-driven finance executive who is not satisfied with winning over the woman he wants. He craves continual heightened sexual excitement from his &quot;lady friend&quot;. And he uses subtle coercion to achieve his goals. For Elizabeth, played by Bassinger, John is the ideal lover. He makes her breakfast, buys her clothes, brushes her hair. He takes care of her in an interesting role reversal. But nothing is free. In return, John wants Elizabeth to be in his complete control and engage in sensuous sex games. And each game is more intense than the last.\n\nAt first the games seem innocent enough. He likes to blindfold her and play a touchy-feely game in which he introduces objects that she feels and/or tastes. But then the requests become more intense. He wants her to enact a strip-tease, to dress in a certain way without her consent, and to receive a spanking for being a &quot;nosey parker&quot;. They have sex in the oddest of places, sometimes engaging in intimate contact in public. At first Elizabeth enjoys the attention and the excitement until she begins to lose the sense of herself as the relationship intensifies. And John eventually goes too far. \n\nAt one poignant moment in the film, Elizabeth speaks with an artist-recluse. Because her job is at an art gallery, she helps coordinate artists for exhibitions. When she finds him in a rural area, she asks him if he remembered that his exhibition is coming up. He replies that when he is hungry he remembers to eat and when he is tired he remembers to sleep. She has lost the simpler pleasures of life, and this old man reminds her of that. \n\nLate in the film there is an interesting scene where Elizabeth&apos;s former boyfriend comes to the place she works--not to see her but he is now dating one of her co-workers. He&apos;s a plain man who does not have nearly the sexual allure of Roarke. But he seems kind and honest. Liz watches her co-worker and her former boyfriend leave and there is an expression on her face that speaks volumes: maybe she misjudged him after-all. For a moment, the two stare at each other from a distance, and you get the feeling that she was the one who left him. He is not the Mr Exciting that John is, but maybe he has other qualities that John could never have.\n\nThis is quite a stunning film, certainly not for all tastes, and some of the steamy sex scenes could be misinterpreted as being only for pornographic sake. What saves it are the incredible and absolutely believable performances by the two leads, Roarke and Bassinger which strangely complement one another. Roarke plays his character right on the money, always enigmatic, never raising his voice, but always mysterious. His character is always just outside of reach. He constantly smiles, even when he is noticeable disappointed. Basinger is a perfect complement as one of the few actresses left who can be vulnerable and elicit a willingness to be under control that you don&apos;t see in many female performances anymore. Despite what may appear to be pornography, there is a point to the film I think, and that is that constant sexual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.",

It may actually be reviled more than it is admired, even in horror circles, but it&apos;s one of those few movies that&apos;s provocative, in the truest sense of the word. Nekromantik is the story of a nice young couple with unusual sexual proclivities. Specifically, in order to get off, they require congress with a human corpse -- or at least a nice selection of pickled organs. Fortunately for these two, the fella (Daktari Lorenz) has a good job on the clean-up crew that tidies up automobile accidents, and eventually winds up with a real find, a half-rotten carcass dragged out of a swamp. He brings it home, where he and Betty (Beatrice M.) give it a warm welcome in a distended love scene involving a striking optical-printing technique that leaves motion trails on the screen as someone (presumably Lorenz, who doubled as composer of the score) pounds out the lyrical love theme on a piano. It&apos;s not all hugs and corpses, however, and when Betty abandons Rob after a tiff, the corpse goes with her.",

      "reviewBody": "After several decades of watching movies, you run out of good new ones. One of the special genres in my choices is SCI-FI. \n\nSci-Fi sometimes screws up when it is shallow or it tries to mix with comedy. There are a few exceptions. Some load clichés and your mind goes to sleep. \n\nBut not with this film, from beginning to end, I was engaged with the plot and I cared about the characters. That is because the writer took his time to flesh out the characters and the story. The genre of Sci-Fi was not the intention of this movie, so don&apos;t look for it beyond it&apos;s obvious use.\n\nThat main character is Jiří Mádl. What a naturally charming actor with that quirky smile of his. Immediately he becomes endearing. He was warm, and well engaged in his role. In fact, him and his co-star, Eva Josefíková, were wonderful to watch and their chemistry was palpable.\n\nI am not one of those who will over-analyze the plot or the mechanics of &quot;time travel&quot;. But I have to mention that this film handled it very well. No clichés about the &quot;fish out of water&quot; or other such plot methods with which we are all familiar.\n\nSuffice it to say, I enjoyed this movie and I will watch it again. Even though the movie was in Czech or Slovak, and I had to read subtitles. I thought they did not detract one iota from the enjoyment of the film. In fact, it was really surprising how people REALLY all are the same everywhere when it comes to emotions.\n\nI rated this as high as I could.\n\nGreat job to Milo mídmajer and ALL who made this film!",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie about 18 years ago and found it below average. The main reason for viewing it was may admiration for Gene Wilder after the early Mel Brooks movies... Gene Wilders appearances in The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and, not to forget although not from Mel Brooks, Silver Streak are rightfully and indisputably regarded as masterpieces by now. Compared to these highlights, I actually found The Woman in Red slightly dull.\n\nWatching it on Cable-TV yesterday, i.e. January 2006, I got a completely different impression. I don&apos;t know if the difference is just me being 20 years older and more tuned-in with the main character, but now I experienced a warm, enjoyable movie filled with a mild madness I found most appealing. The spirit of the early 80&apos;s is very evident, this is not a timeless movie. Nevertheless, I find it more up-to-date with human emotions and behavior than most contemporary attempts in the &quot;daily life comedy&quot; genre.\n\nFinally, if you - just like me - was disappointed by this one twenty years ago, give another try!",

I caught myself growing bored at many points throughout the film, which is really surprising given the subject material. It doesn&apos;t help that the acting seems forced most of the time (as if the actors are reading their lines off of cue cards), or that Delpy and Bruhl have about 0 chemistry...\n\nI did, however, love the costumes and the sets, as well as Anamaria Marinca&apos;s unique character. \n\nAll in all, I was just hoping for a bit more. A bit more horror, a bit more suspense, a bit more passion. This movie left little to no impression on me... and I was sorely disappointed.",

All Afrikaaners will be familiar with comedian Leon Schuster&apos;s work (particularly &quot;You must be Joking&quot;) and he plays his character with his usual gusto and madness. The film is hilarious, proving that a juvenile sense of humor doesn&apos;t have to be bad thing (especially during the toilet scene). It&apos;s a fantastic movie with a great cast, inevitably overwhelmed by Schuster .\n\nObviously not everyone will be able to get the South African humor, or indeed, some of the stronger accents, and some could accuse the movie of going for cheap laughs and being unoriginal. But with a that said it still manages to blow most comedies out of the water. And besides, what&apos;s wrong with recycling some jokes if you do them better than they ever were in the first play. Hopefully this will help gain the South African film industry some momentum, but if it doesn&apos;t, well then we still get a cool movie out of it!",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t consider myself picky when it comes to movies. I usually find a thing or two that I like about a movie whether it&apos;s terrible or not. But thisI mean wow. As an avid fan of the show and someone who could easily sit and watch episodes over and over again, I tried to be fair and give it a chance. Obviously, no live-action film could come close to the magnificence of the cartoon, but there are ways to pull it off and at least do it justice. This movie has hardly any theatrical merit. It could be considered a Twilight of moviedom—minus the fanbase.\n\nLet&apos;s start with the characters or, rather, the lack there-of. One of the things that made the cartoon so great was the incredibly complex and well thought-out characterization. Every single character had dimension and depth. As for the movie, not one of the characters even had a personality. They were cardboard cutouts of their animated selves with no drive or purpose. Katara, Sokka, and Aang had no chemistry and were hardly even together during the length of the film. There&apos;s absolutely no motivation for either Sokka or Katara to assist Aang and, had your average movie-goer never seen the show, they would have been wondering what on earth they were doing in the movie at all. I didn&apos;t get a father-and-son relationship between Zuko and Iroh, which is one of the most important relationships in the entire series, one that eventually changes Zuko for the better. I could hardly see Zuko doing anything for Iroh in the film other than order him around. Momo and Appa got virtually no screen time and every time I got a glimpse of Momo&apos;s face I kept thinking &quot;Zaboomafoo.&quot; I won&apos;t complain about the way either were rendered, as I don&apos;t think it really mattered considering the fact that they played no role in the story, anyway. Overall I felt the casting was dreadful. Both Katara and Zuko were too young, in my opinion, but Katara&apos;s lack of age could have been compensated by portraying a strong-willed charactersomething that was never accomplished. None of the characters resembled their animated counterparts: Sokka wasn&apos;t sarcastically charming, Katara wasn&apos;t determined or motherly, and Aang lacked any and all of his lovable boyish-ness. Zhou was annoying, Iroh had no jolly, old-man qualities, and Fire Lord Ozai? There was absolutely nothing threatening about him at all. I didn&apos;t so much mind that he was in it in the first place, but couldn&apos;t they have at least made him unapproachable? I felt like I could have walked up and punched him in the face without any repercussions.\n\nThe story was botched at best and felt like nothing but a string of events pieced together through basic transitions. It&apos;s one thing to stray from the original source for the sake of flow and continuity, but nothing about the story made sense unless you had seen the show, and even then, I was left confused and annoyed when things were switched around without any obvious reasoning. I understand that re-writing eight or nine hours&apos; worth of material into a two-hour movie is a challenge for even the most skilled screenwriter, but it&apos;s been done before and could have been done here. My biggest disappointment was the fact that Sozin&apos;s comet, the most important aspect of the plot and the driving force for the Aang Gang to defeat the Firelord, was only briefly mentioned at the very end. The fact that this movie left out major plot points, key characters like King Bumi and the Kyoshi warriors, and jumbled around the order of various events is inexcusable. The source material was there; all that needed to be done was to use it and mold it properly. Rather than write the script, M. Night should have hired a screenwriter who actually knew what he was doing.\n\nAs for the effects, I can&apos;t say much. It&apos;s not one of the things I focus on in a movie, even for something that was meant to be heavily influenced by martial arts and elemental magic. I will say that the bending was hideous, and not because of the way the special effects were done. In the original cartoon, every movement corresponded with a reaction; in the film, it took five or ten motions for anything to even happen. Because of this, the bending didn&apos;t look natural in any way and came across as pitiful and useless. The fact that the fire benders couldn&apos;t shoot fire out of their hands made their bending look much less powerful than it should have been. Perhaps the thing that annoyed me the most was Katara&apos;s obvious lack of talent at water bending, a fact that gave the story no benefit and looked more like M. Night just never watched the show.\n\nSince I don&apos;t like to totally crush something, I will say a few things I found salvageable about the film. For one thing, I thought the scenery and costumes were decent. They had the look of the show but without much character to them. I liked Yue, who looked a great deal like her character, perhaps the most of any of the actors. The way they did Aang&apos;s arrow was kind of cool with all of the detailing, but it could have been a little more visible. The only thing I can say I thought was a nice addition was Zuko&apos;s mentioning that his father said he was &quot;like his mother.&quot; That was the one and only nice touch. More than anything the first twenty minutes of the film gave me a good laugh as it was clear that the entire movie would be a disaster.\n\nOverall I am sincerely glad I didn&apos;t bother to pay money to see this movie and strongly encourage anyone else to avoid it. Spend your money elsewhere, such as purchasing or renting the first season of the show."

      "reviewBody": "I actually really enjoyed this. Its a simple, sweet movie with fantastic acting from all involved. The fact that it was made in 1979 only makes it that much more fun to watch. Mel Gibson (in one of his earliest roles) is VERY nice to look at (remember &quot;that&quot; Mel) and he spends most of the movie smiling while running around in Stubbies and a singlet (American translation wee, wee Magnum PI shorts and a tank top) we even get a speedo at one point.\n\nThe story follows a middle aged American woman (played brilliantly by Piper Laurie) who hires a simple minded handyman, 24 year old &quot;Tim&quot; as her gardener. The two develop a friendship, she teaches him to read and takes him on trips to the beach.\n\nTheir relationship eventually turns romantic following the death of Tim&apos;s mother. At first Mary denies her feelings, Tim experiences jealousy and then his father asks Mary to look after Tim when he passes.\n\nI really enjoyed the family dynamic here, both of the parents were fantastic, just great acting in this, and I fell a bit in love with Alwyn Kurts who played Tim&apos;s father. There is also a neat scene with Mary reading The Thorn Birds (Tim was based on a novel by Colleen McCullough) as well as all of the cups of tea and middies of beer at the pub, true blue. This was A bit of a gem actually. 11/4/15",

Upon his transfer from prison to the execution site a group of militia members ambush the van which happens to also be carrying their group leader &quot;Captain Robert Jackson (Lonnie Colon) as well. Although the militia members offer to take him with them Adam refuses and decides to go his own way. Not long afterward he winds up in the campsite of Christians led by his former friend, &quot;Jacob Krause&quot; (Brad Heller). But while the Christians welcome Adam whole-heartedly they also recognize the fact that Adam is now a well-recognized fugitive which will only result in increased difficulties for all of them. Anyway, rather than detail the rest of the story I will just say that this sequel was definitely equal to the first movie. It had an excellent story and decent acting all the way around and regardless if one is a fan of this particular genre I think that most people will probably get some enjoyment out of it.

Teens that is and especially women/girls of course.\n\nThe main actress reminded me of a very young Nora Tschirner. She is sweet but still has fight in her. And has obviously her beauties. Though some might argue that she does talk too much. The plot though is very predictable and you do know where it&apos;s all going to end. Still Kudos for giving a character (bodyguard) more time on screen and more character beats than other movies would have done. Cheesy, but also adorable (in some strange ways)",

      "reviewBody": "At the zoo, Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) sees the mysterious Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), who is sketching a black panther. He&apos;s intrigued by her--it seems to be love at first sight--and is surprised when she invites him into her apartment for a cup of tea. While in her apartment, he sees an odd statue of a man on horseback, holding a sword-skewered cat high in the air. Dubrovna tells him of her native Serbia, and the legend of unchristian &quot;cat people&quot; who were driven into the mountains. Dubrovna&apos;s behavior becomes increasingly odd, and animals often react strangely to her. Could she have something to do with the legend of the cat people? \n\nThis was director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton&apos;s first horror/thriller film together (they were to do two others together, I Walked With A Zombie (1943) and The Leopard Man (1943)), and for my money, this is the best of the three. Lewton was famous for understated, atmospheric horror that suggested more than it showed, a style that is also evident in his later collaborations with director Robert Wise (who went on to direct the infamous The Haunting (1963), which is often thought to be a pinnacle of this more &quot;suggestive&quot; style, although it&apos;s not a particular favorite of mine).\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, a lot of younger horror fans, for whom the oldest film that they are really familiar with in the genre is something like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) or an even more recent film, might be reluctant to call Cat People a horror film. It is &quot;talky&quot;, doesn&apos;t contain any graphic violence, and we don&apos;t even see a horror creature/villain until just a glimpse near the very end of the film. But it is horror--the talking is centered on a captivating supernatural &quot;myth&quot;, there are a lot of creepy, well-photographed scenes laden with heavy shadows, there are a couple exquisite chase/suspense scenes, and there is a lot of complex, dark psychological interaction.\n\nThe psychological tension is really the focus, as Lewton and Tourneur&apos;s films together are moral parables that function more as a metaphor for horror (rather than the more common flipside, where the horror is more prominent and might be a metaphor for some other kind of philosophical point). In this case, the moral and social situations are varied and complex, but are all focused on romantic relationships, ranging from quick actions taken due to lust, to emotional distancing, adultery and abuse of power. The more one watches the film, the more one is likely to get out of the subtextual messages. They remain more subtextual than they might in modern cinema because of content restrictions imposed by studios in this era (although of course those were a reaction to prevalent cultural attitudes at the time). But in retrospect, the buried nature of the themes is a benefit, at least in this case.\n\nOccasionally, the horrific aspect of these types of films can be too understated, so that they simply become realist dramas. That&apos;s not the case here. This is a film that is rewarding on many levels.\n\nA 9 out of 10 from me.",

Erica Durance does give a good performance, but then she always does but that doesn&apos;t diminish the fact that the way the script is written we learn nothing about the main characters.

      "name": "Spaghetti/Paella Western co-produced between Italy and Spain  , starred by customary actors as Steffen ,  Camardiel and Sambrell",
      "reviewBody": "Italian/Spanish production full of action , excessive characters , shootouts and lots of violence . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some violence , shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes. The movie gets the usual Western issues, such as avenger antiheroes , violent facing off , exaggerated baddies, soundtrack with Morricone influence , among them . For money, for pleasure, for revenge, he doesn&apos;t care why he kills or how . It deals with a dramatic story of a feud between implacable enemies . Arizona Colt (Anthony Steffen) is aware to put a reward on his head for a stagecoach&apos;s hold-up he didn&apos;t commit . Arizona is wanted ¨dead or alive , reward : 1000 dollars . Arizona along with his partner Double Whiskey (Roberto Camardiel) set out in pursuit the true guilty . They arrive in a little town where Arizona is taken prisoner by a Marshal and he is condemned to hanging . Thanks a trick and helped by Double Whiskey , Arizona escapes . Meanwhile, a band of cutthroats (Raf Baldassarre , Luis Barboo , Fernando Bilbao) led by Chico (Aldo Sambrell) attack a ranch of a powerful baron land (Jose Luis Martin) and kidnap his daughter (Rosalba Neri) . Then Arizona robs their gold boxes and happens a bloody vendetta and reckoning . Colt is double-crossed and imprisoned by the nasties and submitted to cruel tortures . Later on , there takes place some exciting scenes of men fighting to the death .\n\nThis Western contains action-packed , ruthless characters , quick-fire , violence , rapacious revenge , slaughter , shoot&apos;em up and results to be quite entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . A good example of Latino western genre from Italy and Spain ; it is daring , a notoriously violent Spaghetti , so extreme in every way , it is one of the handful of Italian Western that abounded in the 60s and early 70s . This moving Spaghetti packs noisy action , thrills , crossfire , twists and turns with exciting final . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the ending and the unusual conclusion . &quot;Arizona Si Scatenò.. Li Fece Fuori Tutti&quot; or ¨Arizona Colt returns¨ results to be a following to a character played by Giuliano Gemma in ¨Arizona Colt¨(1966) by Michele Lupo starred by Gemma , Corinne Marchand , Andrea Bosic and again Roberto Camardiel and Rosalba Neri . Well starred by Anthony Steffen , he may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados, but in his day, from the mid-&apos;60s to the early &apos;70s, Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics. The handsome, Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz de Teffè von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica. From there, Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre, where he found his niche. Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood, however, Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction. It&apos;s a thrilling western with screenplay by the notorious Ernesto Gastaldi , including a breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Anthony Steffen against the heartless Aldo Sambrell and his hoodlums such as Luis Barboo , Ralph Baldassarre , Dan van Husen and Fernando Bilbao . Exciting Spaghetti Western and it is proceeded in violent style and ordinary narration . The film packs thrills , gunplay and high body-count ; it&apos;s fast moving , quite entertaining and including bursting with explosive violence . Being a Spanish/Italian co-production , here appears familiar faces from Chorizo or Paella or Tortilla Western such as Aldo Sambrell , Luis Barboo , Fernando Bilbao and the sympathetic Robert Camardiel as co-starring . Good production design creating an acceptable scenario with luminous outdoors, rocky landscapes under a shinning sun and fine sets by Jose Luis Galicia , habitual production designer of a lot of Westerns shot in Spain . Middling cinematography by Miguel Mila , being necessary a right remastering and filmed on location in Manzanares Del Real , Colmenar , La Pedriza (Madrid) and interior in Elios Studios , Rome . Nice musical score by Bruno Nicolai , usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone , furthermore a catching and emotive leitmotif .\n\n¨Arizona Lets Fly and Kill Everybody&quot; or &quot;Arizona Colt Returns&quot; was regularly directed by the prolific filmmaker Sergio Martino who usually uses pseudonym as Martin Dolman . Talented and versatile writer/director Sergio Martino has made a vast array of often solid and entertaining films in all kind of genres as horror, Giallo , comedy, Western , and science fiction in a career that spans over 40 years . He was especially expert on Western as proved in ¨Mannaja¨ and this ¨Arizona returns¨ and Giallo such as ¨The case of scorpion&apos;s tail ¨ , ¨Torso¨ ,¨the scorpion with two tails¨ , ¨The strange vice of Mrs Ward¨ , Cannibal movie as &quot;Mountain of the Cannibal God&quot;, Italian crime thrillers as &quot;Violent Professionals&quot; and ¨Sci-Fi as ¨Destroyer¨ , &quot;2019: After the Fall of New York&quot; . Rating: Middling though passable Spaghetti , this is a Ravioli/Chorizo Western in which the camera stalks in moving style throughout a story with decent visual skills . This is a bewildering story , funny in some moment but falls flat , though it will appeal to Spaghetti hardcore fans .",

Only to find herself in over her head the next day when she finds herself chained up in the basement.\n\nAside from Green herself who doesn&apos;t appear to have any acting talent whatsoever, the movie isn&apos;t all THAT awful. Yea the marketing of it to attempt to capitalize off the success of the Twilight series is crass, tacky &amp; wholly unneeded, but aside from all the BS there lays a somewhat well-thought out film.",

And in this case the stars are two all-time greats of Hong Kong cinema, Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui.  Cheung&apos;s complex performance as Mui&apos;s lover, simultaneously devoted and ambivalent, is nuanced by the knowledge of his real-life homosexuality.  Throughout the film, the camera returns to focus on Mui&apos;s face; she holds one&apos;s interest through her ability to convey her inner thoughts through an amazing range of facial expressions.\n\nThis complicated love story is now made more poignant by the real life fact that both actors died young, in 2003 - Cheung by suicide and Mui by cancer. Recommended for romantics, film buffs, and devotees of Cheung and Mui."

Simon Sez breaks records on this note. After 2 minutes, i thought i was about to watch an enjoyable, if predictable, action/comedy with pretty poor acting. after 5 mins, i realised that i had found a film even worse than Carnosaur. After 10 minutes, a reverse triple summersault in the pike position out of my window 12th floor window seemed preferable to siting though the rest of this rubbish. Saving graces: sealed windows, i didn&apos;t rent the film but watched it on cable...though i am tempted to unsubscribe after this, and, finally, this &quot;film&quot; got my mind back on doing some out of work reading on the financial markets. a dry topic at the best of times, but compared to Rodman, Sjoberg and that clown of a sidekick in this &quot;film&quot;, it was humorous, witty and left me feeling refreshed.\n\nSo, for those of you who have read the above and ca see that i am still sitting on the fence regarding this film. i shall be explicit: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. IF GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN PAINFUL TOOTH EXTRACTION AND THIS MASTERPIECE, GO TO THE DENTIST. DENTAL PAIN GOES GOES AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY, THIS MAY WARP YOU FOR LIFE!",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those well-crafted films from Twentieth-Century Fox when that studio employed some extraordinary talents both before and behind the cameras.  Although he wasn&apos;t a Fox contractee, Edward G. Robinson gives a great performance as a wealthy Italian family&apos;s patriarch and he is well-matched by everyone else in the cast, especially Richard Conte, Luther Adler, and Susan Hayward, looking terrifically classy.  The script bears some obvious signs of being polished by the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and the technical credits are absolutely top-drawer.\n\nRemade as a Western in CinemaScope and Color by DeLuxe in 1954, entitled &quot;Broken Lance&quot; with Spencer Tracy cast as the domineering father, the direction by Edward Dmytryk was not up to the standard of this earlier film with its then contemporary setting.  This one is available on video (and seems to be very rarely exhumed on TV now) and is definitely worth a look."

He is playing with the idea of a classical American thriller, which the male protagonists admire so much, as well as they look for the &quot;American dream&quot; in a Paris in crisis behind its &quot;charmant&quot; appearance.\n\nTavernier&apos;s intention is more realistic and, as life, less perfect than a classical script (curiously, the film is based in real facts). That&apos;s why we don&apos;t know many times where the film is going. But Tavernier employs that time to show us details of the life of very well-built characters. Specially good is the acting of the young woman.\n\nSad (but interesting!) impression in the end of the characters&apos; &quot;career&quot;. As a result of that, we have the impression of a not very healthy society, and without any need to insist by Tavernier during the movie. I recommend it, I feel it is even a bit underrated here.",

Like a skanky French Natural Born Killers but without the talent, irony or indeed entertainment, the heavy-handed symbolism and maddening acting should have you turning off after the first 40 minutes. You continue to watch however, mainly though a fascination as to how far the director is willing to push the boundaries of good taste in order to convince us of his point. Something to do with society raping people and by-products of the system, a reflection of the perversity at the root of civilisation, monkeys with guns and Girl Power.\n\nJoining the sensational release of Irreversible, with its centrepiece a nine minute rape scene, it could look to some that modern French cinema had found itself in a quandary, desperately seeking its next big theme in the rapidly thinning file of the last taboos. Thankfully, L&apos;Homme du train dispelled those fears,at least for now. And maybe just two films don&apos;t make a wave, perhaps just a ripple.\n\nHowever, nothing changes the fact that when the closing credits finally arrived, I was angry. Because it was rubbish. Not a patch on the glory of La Haine which dealt with a similar rage, but with far more heart and intelligence. Baise-Moi also has the worst soundtrack ever. I&apos;ve got to stop wasting my life watching all these terrible films."

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t regard myself fan of exploitation films. Haven&apos;t seen many. But his one has got everything! Fights, nasty faces of the mean guys, violence, immorality, bad attitude, hilarious dialogue, a rape scene, lots of full nudity and the so called (nah, these Americans!) &apos;cat fight&apos;, and ALL these while film is flowing in a non-stop, not-at-all-boring without letting the pace down to slow down at all.\n\nMusic is nice with an uplifting 80&apos;s feel - the film doen&apos;t fall flat until the very end, typically disappointing as a standard American picure, even though it delivers the goods, so no big complaints here.\n\nOK, to sum up: this is probably one of the best-known exploitation pictures and I think it deserves the hype, for what it&apos;s woth. Do not watch this if you&apos;re expecting a &apos;good&apos; film, because it&apos;s no &apos;good&apos; film - still it justifies its supporters and fans of exploitation just by being what it was meant to be. Very funny indeed, I recommend watching with some friend(s) (but no politically correct female, as the film is quite sexist) along with beers or other kind of booze. \n\nEXPLOITATION FANS: A MUST!!!!! all other weirdos &amp; perverts, this is good entertainment and a nice surprise!"

But one must remember that Samuel Goldwyn was primarily making this film as children&apos;s entertainment. And on that level he succeeded brilliantly.\n\nIn fact at the age of 5 in the cinema in Brooklyn this was the first movie on the big screen I ever remember seeing. My father was a big Danny Kaye fan so the whole family went to see it. And of course one of the first long-playing records we had in our house was the soundtrack to that film. \n\nAnother reviewer said that Frank Loesser&apos;s score was the highlight for him in the film. I don&apos;t think Danny Kaye ever had better material to sing with on the screen. Up to this point he got by with stuff especially written for him by his wife Sylvia Fine. He proved here in Hans Christian Anderson that he could definitely succeed without it.\n\nAnyway when I view this film I&apos;m five years old again. You will be too if you see it.",

And, of course, Garbo&apos;s favorite cinematographer, William Daniels, is behind the camera making sure that she gets her fair share of lush close-ups.\n\nIt starts out promisingly enough as a Gothic melodrama with Garbo fleeing the advances of a drunken fiancé ALAN HALE and rushing out into the storm. She seeks shelter in a barn but is discovered by CLARK GABLE who promptly takes a shine to her and invites her to take shelter under his roof. The opening scenes with Garbo and Gable have an innocent charm that makes them delightful to watch, with Gable giving a more natural performance than Garbo who already has a bag of transparent acting tricks.\n\nThe plot thickens when Susan Lenox is forced to flee Gable&apos;s residence when her strict father and fiancé show up to bring her home. She ends up taking refuge on a circus train and ends up being &quot;kept&quot; by one of the managers. When she&apos;s reunited with Gable, it begins a series of misunderstandings. Garbo plays her role like the real diva she was, even pronouncing Gable&apos;s name--&quot;Rodney&quot;--in a melodramatic way.\n\nIt&apos;s strictly downhill into pulp romance territory for the rest of the way. It&apos;s Gable who gives one of his most likable performances and sustains interest in the story&apos;s development--not Garbo.\n\nSumming up: Only for die-hard Garbo fans. Noteworthy for a very fine beginning which soon lapses into mediocrity.",

The film is hosted and narrated by no less than William Shatner himself.\n\nEverything from the Peruvian Crystal Skull to the megalith structures in the jungles of Southeast Asia is accepted as evidence for the Ancient Astronauts theory. Cave drawings, old legends, Biblical stories and even some psychic visions of late Jeane Dixon are understood as stone cold facts. Eric von Däniken&apos;s reputation was still quite unspoiled at the time so all the arguments (even the most far-fetched) are shown with a great confidence.\n\nWilliam Shatner is–as usual–overacting his part. With all the strange &quot;scientific&quot; people, long shots, enthusiastic Shatner and eerie 70&apos;s synthesizer music this amazing documentary was from the day one destined to become a cult classic.",

      "reviewBody": "This particular Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott collaboration finds Scott as the meanest he ever was on the screen. At least since Coroner Creek where he played a similarly driven man on a vengeance quest against a man who killed his bride to be.\n\nIt&apos;s worse in Decision at Sundown. A few years earlier when Scott was away at war John Carroll took up with Scott&apos;s late wife. Now Randy with sidekick Noah Beery, Jr. has come into the town of Sundown looking to kill Carroll who has moved there and essentially taken over with his bought and paid for sheriff Andrew Duggan. Carroll by no coincidence I&apos;m sure is getting married to Karen Steele that day, the daughter of a local rancher John Litel much to the dismay of Carroll&apos;s long time mistress Valerie French.\n\nScott interrupts the wedding and then he and Beery are trapped in a barn. While all this is going on a lot of the townsfolk who have let Carroll and his bully boys run roughshod over them start reexamining what&apos;s happened to their town.\n\nDecision at Sundown shows Randolph Scott as the ugliest he ever was on the screen. He&apos;s a pretty mean hero in Coroner Creek as Chris Danning. But his character of Bart Allison in this film makes Danning look like a Boy Scout.\n\nI can&apos;t say any more, you&apos;ll just have to see the rather unusual ending in this film and how it works out for Scott and the rest of the town of Sundown.\n\nLet&apos;s just say he changed everyone&apos;s life, but his own.",

      "reviewBody": "Though Shawshank Redemption has gotten the critical raves and the box office receipts that could make it the best prison story ever filmed, my personal choice for the best film ever done about the penal system is Brubaker.\n\nBased on the true life experiences of Thomas Murton, the co-author of the book the film is based on, Brubaker captures the realities of prison life, the complexities of trying to &quot;reform&quot; the system without sacrificing one iota of entertainment.\n\nRobert Redford leads a great ensemble cast in this film. The people here are real, dealing with complex issues for which there are no simple answers. The corruption of the penal system runs deep and helped in part by the prisoners themselves who don&apos;t want to see too much change at once or have a vested interest in seeing things run just as they are. Yaphetto Kotto and Tim McIntire are two such prison trustees, both of them showing very different reasons why they don&apos;t like some or all of what Redford is doing as warden.\n\nAmong the supporting cast, I&apos;d like to single out David Keith who was the best as the prisoner whose life Brubaker saves and ultimately becomes his biggest booster in the joint. A really outstanding job by David Keith as this simple country kid who just got caught up in &quot;the system.&quot;\n\nRare you can say a film is informative as well as entertaining, but Brubaker definitely fits in both categories.",

Hey, like THE GIRL CAN&apos;T HELP IT for example. How&apos;s this for the full hurricane force of the fun of it all: On Saturday June 11th 2005, as part of the Sydney Film Festival, there was a screening at the 2300 seat Sydney cinema treasurebox THE STATE THEATRE. Guess how many turned up: go on...have a guess...give up? well would you believe...... 2300 people !!! at $12.50 a ticket!! all ready to shatter the chandeliers and lift the roof in unison shrieking and howling with glee at this hilarious musical farce designed to do no more than outrageously entertain. And it did. Maybe best seen like this in a crowded picture palace of good natured punters keen to have communal cinema bliss, but I do believe it was all the rage back in 1956 as well, with Jayne doing Marilyn and Ewell leering and looking sideways. Fab deluxe colour never looked better and with a roster of glamour clad stars, all giving us their all for the FOX/Tashlin schedule it works superbly for 91 minutes of pure 50s delight. Yes it is funny! It&apos;s supposed to be! Just enjoy it. Or move to Australia.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been a busy year for Steven Seagal, with almost innumerable films added to his CV. Many films, but a generally bog standard of movies, with Today You Die, rivalling last years atrocious Out Of Reach in the crappola stakes. Thankfully Black Dawn marks a vast improvement in thrills for a Seagal film and his best film since his big comeback, Exit Wound&apos;s a far, far away now, 4 years ago. This is also far better than the Foreigner, the film for which this is essentially a sequel to.\n\nThe film is very much in the style of the Bourne movies with the formula agency spooks and espionage stuff. It&apos;s very formulaic however the film is done with more intelligence than many of these kind of DTV nuclear/political conspiracy films, which albeit still doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s all that intelligent. What I can say about this film, that sadly I haven&apos;t been able to say about recent Seagal flicks, is that there is a level of competence to the film and also Seagal himself doesn&apos;t stink up the movie as he did with the otherwise okay Submerged. The film is well shot and looks decent and although the editing is a little to flashy at times it generally is slick and gives the film a polished look. The cinematography goes for a naturalistic look like the Bourne films did. The score also ranges from decent, when it is ripping off John Powell&apos;s Bourne scores, to a bit lazy and average during action scenes and less important scenes.\n\nAs for the action: This is also a mixed bag with gun fights ranging from competent to lazily and quickly constructed. While the fight sequences, which are extremely few and brief, are poor. The poorness of the fights however are due to the fact that Seagal isn&apos;t present in any of them, even though his character is involved. They are poor because Seagal is hardly even used for inserts and his double is constantly being used so the director is attempting to hide this fact. As a result the fights are incredibly disorientating leaving you unsure if Seagal&apos;s character is even fighting. However there is a great car chase and the film also includes some impressive stunts. Stunt-Co-ordinator Dicky Beer certainly gives the film some excitement in periods and does a good job.\n\nAs for the big guy himself? Well Seagal it must be said is far more interested this time around. He at least performs all his own dialogue, as far as I was aware. However what is still evident is that clearly he isn&apos;t really enjoying himself too much. He also has that expected, but still annoying tendency to lazily and breathily whisper all his dialogue, with a &quot;I hate this crap dialogue!&quot; look on his face. There is still also the fact that Seagal regularly uses a stand in, as well as overworking his stunt double again. The film has a strange feeling to it in another respect and that is the sheer fact that overall Seagal doesn&apos;t have a lot of screen time considering he is the main lead. This means there is more focus, perhaps too much on the bad guys. Seagal disappears on occasion for up to 5 minutes. I would guess that Seagal was probably only involved in about 70% of the shooting schedule. Whether this fact is due to laziness, contract stipulation or other filming commitments (after all he does do 4 movies a year now!) I don&apos;t know, it just feels strange for the lead to go awol so often for so long.\n\nThe film is also blessed with a good supporting cast compared to other Seagal flicks. The bad guys aren&apos;t too clichéd while John Pyper Ferguson is a welcome casting, even though he seems to be putting on a bizarre accent (his character is British). Tamara Davies is hot and all round decent as Seagal&apos;s sidekick while Seagal&apos;s character is also slightly more interesting than usual cause Jonathan Cold I feel isn&apos;t a cut and dried good guy. This guy has his bad side unlike Seagal&apos;s usual goody two-shoes image.\n\nOverall this is a marked improvement for Seagal. The first and last 20 minutes are pretty good and even though the middle section drags quite a bit the film still never had that feeling of being terrible like Today You Die. The film has it&apos;s own action too, not borrowing from other films and the car chase is excellent. Seagal fans will be pleased with this and I was surprised by my enjoyment levels for this especially after the diabolically bad trailer the movie had. Still though, Stevo has some work to do. Shadows Of The Past sounds like it has promise though. **",

      "reviewBody": "In a recent trend, the film going public has favored a cinematic experience of what I like to call &quot;Hand it Overs&quot;. These phenomena can be as creative as the &quot;big reveal&quot; at the end of early M. Night Shymalan films, or as effortless in reality as passing the mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving dinner. They give the majority of today&apos;s audiences exactly what they want, instant gratification. Imagine if we never saw Malcom Crowe&apos;s real fate completely unfold in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or Elija Prince&apos;s true self-revealed in &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. How would this change our perception and enjoyment of them? The Merry Gentleman marks Michael Keatons Directorial debut by chance due to the sudden illness of screenwriter Ron Lazzeretti who was originally slated to Direct. Keaton also stars as Frank Logan, a depressed hit man, alongside Kate Frazier (Kelly Macdonald) a woman who has just escaped from an abusive relationship. As the plot unfolds, Frank and Kate end up mysteriously crossing paths, which spawns an unconventional, often uncomfortable and strained romance between these two mixed up individuals from different worlds.\n\nKeaton&apos;s first shot at direction does everything but fall into a &quot;Hand It Over&quot;. His pacing is agonizingly slow, yet unbelievably careful. Discerning and seasoned viewers will appreciate his intricate placement and organization of scenes for the greater purpose, if not during the film then certainly after the credits roll. Others will become fed up with his unconventional style a third of the way through, and if they haven&apos;t walked out of the theater before the final scene may let out a strained, &quot;That&apos;s It?&quot; and huff out the door unsatisfied. For me it took a good fifteen minutes after the picture ended before everything clicked and I was blindsided by the sheer brilliance of what I had seen; deep themes rich in symbolism of religion and redemption and the overall feeling that Keaton felt no responsibility as an artist to spell it out for us.\n\nPerformances all around play it safe but are always believable and gratifying to watch. As a virtual no name, Macdonald holds her own quite well, even while sporting an Irish accent that can sometimes border on a tad annoying and contrived. In front of the camera, Keaton never fails to please and continues to frustrate me when I realize that he has been almost entirely absent from view since the mid nineties. Supporting cast gets the job done and Bobby Cannavale delivers a poignant, gripping and short-lived scene stealing performance as Kate&apos;s boyfriend.\n\nThe question that will remain on many of our minds is, &quot;what exactly is the fine line between complete obscurity and masterpiece, and did Keaton cross it?&quot; That&apos;s for each of us to decide individually, but it is in the opinion of this reviewer that said line is imaginary. As an art form, film should have no boundaries, regardless of how many cookie cutter, &quot;How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days&quot; burnt offerings Hollywood Studios continuously try to force down our throats. After all is said and done, it does feel good to sink your teeth into a double quarter pounder, but on occasion, Yellow Tail Sashima can prove to be extremely rewarding. After all, grandma always said try everything once.",

      "reviewBody": "Michel Audiard was first a screenwriters whose lines for the last Gabin movies were often memorable ;in 1968,he began a director career and produced a lot of comedies a la Française such as&quot; Faut Pas Prendre Les Enfants Du Bon Dieu Pour Des Enfants Sauvages&quot; or &quot;Le Drapeau Noir Flotte Sur La Marmite&quot; ,the titles speak for themselves.\n\nIf the stubborn witty spirit of Sacha Guitry whispered in someone&apos;s ears in 1974,it&apos;s certainly Michel Audiard&apos;s ;Guitry told,in his own way ,the history of his country ,but he stops at WW2,because he runs into trouble after the Liberation.\n\nFans of Godard ,be warned though:this is not the kind of movie you may expect:unlike Guitry ,who reconstructed history,Audiard&apos;s effort is a documentary,which entirely consists of archival footage ,from ,roughly,the pre-WW2 era to present (1974 that is;when Georges Pompidou was president:he was to die that very year)\n\nAudiard tells the story :he is caustic ,insolent ,his voice recalling that of Guitry in his historical works:for instance,a Reductio ad Absurdum proves us that the Vichy government did not happen!Many songs are included ,notably &quot; En Revenant De La Revue&quot; ,which was heard in Renoir&apos;s &quot;La Règle Du Jeu&quot; (1939).In spite of the title,France does not always come off well in all those years.\n\nUnlike the other Audiard movies,this one is almost never screened on TV;it as not a success when it was theatrically released :the form certainly put off the audience who did not recognize &quot;their Audiard&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "As there was no rewiew here, I think it would be good to put some words about this quite unusual movie.\n\nFirst of all - I saw this movie with subtitles, since i couldn&apos;t find voiced version. With a rare movies from &apos;talkies&apos; era like this it&apos;s quite common. At some moments i had the feeling that subtitles may be more or less incomplete and did not reveal all details of sophisticated language, but still i found dialogues interesting and the overall story was easy to understand.\n\nThe movie focuses on indian campaign of Alexander the Great, and depicts it more from indian perspective - meaning at some point we can see Alexander more like invader and king Porus like idealised protector of homeland. From the very beginning we see impressive decorations of palace settings - I was very surprised to see such good depiction of foreign costumes in an indian movie (although in closer look a nimble eye can see fakeness of all greek armors). Visuals are the stongest side of the movie - although camera work isn&apos;t so impressive and sometimes diminishes the aestetic effectiveness of scenery. Battle scenes in movie - they are different... Sometimes depiction is nominal and sometimes we can see an elephant charge through infantry made without any special effects - absolutly mindblowing!\n\nAlthough the story is not very complicated, the movie has very slow pace. Some simple dialogue scenes are more several minutes long. Its good to show character&apos;s deepest motivations, but in the middle of the film we know motivations of every character quite well - and neverthenless movie has this slow temp to the end.\n\nFew words about characters - there is some very distinct and interesting ones. Alexandr is depicted always optimistic and joyful neverlosing young conqueror - pretty realistic in my opinion. Rukhsana is just adorable in her youth and passion. Aristotle showed here very astere and cold but later we see, that there is still humanity beneath logics of the wise. And of course Porus - an idealized near-chakravarti (ideal ruler in buddhism) in this movie, still has a stong bit of charm in his all-about-virtues attitude of mind.\n\nWhat an indian movie without songs? There is some (not too much), and they are pretty lovely, although one song choice still make me scratch my head - a greek soldiers, singing &apos;Life is all about love&apos; while marching on conquest? That must be some bad translation or maybe here comes that long expected cultural difference?..",

The music soundtrack is excellent, by Spanish composer Roque Baños, and Timothy Hutton does a fantastic job in this film. This is a good genre film and as that it fully achieves its goals. David Kelly does a fantastic job too in his role . The director is Daniel Monzón , previously a movie critic for Fotogramas magazine and this is his 3rd movie as a director . In resume , this movie don&apos;t pretend to be nothing but a genre movie. And as that it succeeds.",

      "reviewBody": "Nagesh Kukunoor narrates a sublime and powerful tale of two women, intertwined by destiny. It is a story of quest- quest of love and the extent to which the protagonist is prepared to go for it. It is a subtle documentary on women subjugation and emancipation- a story of sisterhood. It is a narration of humanity and human relationships. The story moves us, it stirs us. None of the earlier works of Kukunoor prepares us for this marvelous fête of aesthetics and emotions.\n\nIt provides a landscape hidden to the eyes of the modern India. It paints a picture of an all together different world. The canvas is unfamiliar, but the characters are so easy to relate to- so easy to empathize with. Their pain is our pain; their jubilations are ours. We laugh for them and cry for them at the same time. They become for once us, and we become them.\n\nThe depiction of fiercely independent woman, Zeenat, by Gul Panag is by far her best performance on the celluloid. She essays a very powerful character which would go to any extreme to save her love- her background, religion, and limited resources not withstanding. She inspires respect for the character in the hearts of the audience. She tells us of the revolution which is silently happening in the hinterlands of India, where women are slowly but surely coming out of their traditional roles and becoming more empowered. She conveys this is a subtle way through her convincing and yet underplayed performance.\n\nMeera is played by Ayesha Takia. And what a performance this is. Those who have seen Takia in her earlier roles would never be able to guess the sheer genius this actor is. One is forced to wonder what took her so long to express her real acting talent. Watch out especially for the scene where Meera&apos;s husband&apos;s battered suitcase is delivered in the veranda and she approaches it. Very few actors have been able to achieve the brilliance in their delivery to the extent she does in this scene.\n\nThrough his characterization of funny &quot;behrupiya&quot; Shreyas Talpade introduces an element of spontaneous fun with out disturbing the underlying emotional depth of the movie. He goes one step further from his earlier performance in Iqbal- show-casing a previously huge untapped talent. His appearance in the movie adds an extra zing to this tale of sisterhood.\n\nScreenplay has done justice to all the characters. Secondary characters are also very well formed. Cinematography is awe-inspiring. The parched landscape of Rajasthan adds a kind of mysticism to the story. The juxtaposition of the story against this landscape adds an extra element of poignancy. Background music adds to the story without becoming overbearing. Technical departments have done a marvelous job. It shows in the movie that a lot of love and thought has gone into making of this movie.\n\nAll in all this is the best movie that has come out of Bollywood in a long time. It is a definite 9 out of 10. (I hesitate to give it 10 out of 10 because of the character played by Kukunoor himself in the movie that creates disharmony in the storyline.)",

The two of them spend their times working as well as messing around but they&apos;re thrown for a loop when Benson (Harvey Keitel) shows up. What they don&apos;t know is that Benson has killed the real Captain that they were expecting and he&apos;s brought on board a new robot that can think and act for itself.\n\nSATURN 3 is a film that was released to some really awful reviews with most critics calling it one of the worst films of the year. Even worse for the filmmakers was the fact that people believed the critics and stayed away from the pictures making it a huge disaster at the box office. The film eventually gained a cult following on video but there&apos;s no question that this is one of the weirdest movies released from this era.\n\nThe film was released early in 1980 but there&apos;s no doubt that it has a 70&apos;s vibe to it. The film is without a doubt one of the dumbest science fiction movies ever made. You can read Roger Ebert&apos;s review where he points out countless flaws with the scientific aspect of the film including such easy stuff as gravity. I will admit that the film is really dumb and there&apos;s an even bigger problem with the screenplay and that&apos;s the fact that we don&apos;t really know why Benson wanted on the spaceship and we really don&apos;t know why the robot goes crazy.\n\nSpeaking of the crazy robot, the final twenty-minutes of the movie are basically like a slasher as Alex and Adam must run, hide and try to fight the robot that is after them. What&apos;s even stranger is the three-way love story that blossoms and the fact that the robot wants to join as it falls for Fawcett. Douglas, for the most part, gives a good performance and Fawcett does what she was paid to do and that&apos;s look sexy. Her role doesn&apos;t really allow her much to do but the two stars do show off some nudity. I think Keitel was good in the part but the awful dubbing really hurts the film. I&apos;m familiar enough with his voice where I could picture it saying the lines in the movie and I can&apos;t help but think things would have played out better with it.\n\nSATURN 3 has a lot of bad things in it but at the same time it&apos;s weirdly watchable. Some of the special effects are good, although quite dated. Some are really lousy looking but at the same time they&apos;re still fun. The film really does play out like a film that tries to be intelligent and thinks that it is intelligent yet most people are laughing. It certainly takes itself way too serious but overall the film is mildly entertaining as a cult film."

      "reviewBody": "You can&apos;t beat a movie where Billie Burke is afraid some other woman will run off with Roland Young! Roland Young reprises his role as &quot;Topper,&quot; that poor man who sees ghosts, in this third &quot;Topper&quot; movie; the TV show would have Leo G. Carroll in the title role. I remember it well - I&apos;d like to say I remember it from syndication but alas, I think it was the original series. I&apos;m that old.\n\nThis time around, George and Miriam Kerby have finally passed over and aren&apos;t bothering Topper anymore, but he&apos;s still attracting ghostly presences. This time it&apos;s (ail Richards (Joan Blondell). Topper gives her and her friend Ann Carrington (Carol Landis) a ride to the Carrington estate. There Ann will be seeing her very ill father for the first time in many years, as she was raised in France. As Ann is to inherit everything, it&apos;s no surprise when a chandelier nearly beams her. Later that night, she switches rooms with Gail, who is enamored with the elaborate suite that Ann has, and Gail is murdered. She does what every person in Topper&apos;s world does when they die - she contacts him to help her find out whodunnit.\n\nThis is your typical haunted house mystery with a very witty and clever script. It&apos;s great fun - lots of darkness, sound effects, screams, and slapstick performed by a talented cast. Carol Landis was a gorgeous woman who didn&apos;t quite make it to big stardom and died at the age of 29, possibly realizing her time had passed. She&apos;s about 22 here, beautiful and with a graceful presence. Joan Blondell is top notch, pretty and funny. She just sailed through films like this. Roland Young is great as the befuddled, nervous Cosmo who just doesn&apos;t know how he gets into these situations. \n\nBillie Burke is back as his heartbroken wife who fears she&apos;s losing her husband to yet another blonde. No one can say &quot;Oh, Cosmo, Cosmo&quot; like Burke. When she sees him drive by with Blondell on his lap, she&apos;s appalled and reads him out. &quot;You could have at least waved,&quot; she sobs. &quot;How could I?&quot; he responds.&quot;She was on my lap!&quot; \n\nSometimes these films are uncomfortable because of racism. In this film, Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson is the chauffeur. While Anderson&apos;s part is somewhat stereotypical in that he acts terrified at times, his character seems to have a nice give and take with Topper. And let&apos;s face it - Eddie isn&apos;t the only one scared here. Anderson was a well-known personality, thanks to his wonderful association with Jack Benny. He was a very funny and talented man who never seemed particularly subservient. &quot;Coffee,&quot; Benny would say. &quot;No, thanks, I&apos;ve had some,&quot; he&apos;d answer. He brings a lot to &quot;Topper Returns,&quot; and not in a way that&apos;s demeaning.\n\nRecommended for its good script and great cast.",

      "name": "Russell steps up to the big leagues",
      "reviewBody": "In 1994 and then 1996, David O. Russell proved himself to be one of the few original voices in American comedy with his films SPANKING THE MONKEY and FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, respectively.  He could have continued in that vein, but instead he seemed to be going mainstream with a studio film, starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, which seemed to be an action/adventure set in the Gulf War, at least if you only saw the trailer(which left me going &quot;Huh?&quot;).  After seeing the film, it&apos;s clear to me that Russell is now one of the major talents to emerge from the 90&apos;s, as this is a masterpiece.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the trailer was confusing, but while the movie is clear, Russell(who re-wrote a script by John Ridley, though there&apos;s a lot of contention over who exactly did what) makes clear from the beginning his intention to throw curves at us whenever he can, starting with Wahlberg asking as he draws his sights on an Iraqi soldier, &quot;Are we still shooting at people?&quot;  He shoots the soldier anyway, and is immediately remorseful when he sees the soldier was holding a white flag.  The movie goes from there to soldiers who, although in a celebratory mood, are still somewhat puzzled as to why they&apos;re there, a reporter(played well by the underused Nora Dunn) who can&apos;t help but talk in cliches, a tanker which, when shot, turns out to be holding milk, and Iraqi refugees who thought Americans were going to liberate them from Saddam Hussein and now are suffering because of it.  It&apos;s this attitude which makes the otherwise normal-sounding plot - Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze play soldiers turned thieves who end up with a conscience - play as anything but normal-sounding.\n\nAnother thing which helps is the photography(I forget the guy&apos;s name, but he also did THE USUAL SUSPECTS).  Far from the clear-looking photography we got in the telecasts, this is rough, dangerous, and, just like the plot, constantly putting us off our guard.\n\nFinally, the performances.  Clooney I think has long been underappreciated not, as most people assume, because he&apos;s a sex symbol, but because he, like Harrison Ford and others of his type, make it look easy.  There&apos;s nothing easy about his character here, and Clooney doesn&apos;t take the easy way out here.  He doesn&apos;t coast on his charm and try to make the character likeable, but goes through the journey his character does, and even without a lot of dialogue(at the end, his face when he signals to Wahlberg and Ice Cube says all we need to know, as does their nods back).  Wahlberg is fast becoming one of our better actors, and this proves it.  He even finds comic potential where you wouldn&apos;t expect any.  Ice Cube has had a mixed career since BOYZ IN THE HOOD, but this ranks up with that performance.  Finally, Jonze has been criticized for playing a hillbilly stereotype, but the key is how he&apos;s more like a lapdog hungry for affection rather than just plain white trash, and he plays it as such.  This is the best film I&apos;ve seen so far this year.",

      "reviewBody": "Not as entertaining as the first in the series , but stiil amusing entry in Oss 117 series with John Gavin as absolute starring . While I didn&apos;t enjoy as much as the first in the series this Oss 117 installment results to be an acceptable film into the Eurospy subgenre , whose origin was the James Bond movies and especially : James Bond against Dr. No and From Russia with love by Terence Young . In this one, our starring is posing as a ruthless crook to penetrate into a terrorist organization led by a nasty boss , Curd Jurgens who played the main villiain in Guy Hamilton&apos;s The spy who loved me , and his cohorts , Doctor Saadi : Robert Hossein and a tall henchman : George Eastman . Along the way Gavin runs into a pack of baddies who intent on stopping him .Meanwhile , John Gavin falls for 3 beautiful damsels : The Bond girl Luciana Paluzzi , Rosalba Neri , and Margaret Lee .\n\nTypical Euro spy movie with ordinary ingredients : thrills , noisy action , fights, fantastic gadgets along with strange artifacts , simple helicopters and explosive women . It has some flaws and gaps , as it does tend to get a bit old , including repetitive nature of some fight scenes , but it has big fun , so it cares . John Gavin gives a passable acting as a brave secret agent who infiltrates an criminal organization that especializes in political assassinations by assuming the identity of one of its top killers . Gavin has an easy going air about him that makes him great to see . Gavin starred two classics for Douglas Sirk : Imitation to life and A time to love and a time to die . However , he followed to play secondary roles in Spartacus , Throughly Modern Millie and Pycho , TV series , until his death at 86 . He is well accompanied by a brilliant enemy , Curd Jurgens , and a suitable villain doctor , Robert Hossein. Along with a plethora of Italian secondaries , usual in Spaghetti and Peplum , such as the hunk George Eastman , Renato Baldini , Emilio Messina , Roberto Messina and the always present Piero Lulli . And 3 luscious , bombshell girls : Luciana Paluzzi , Margaret Lee , Rosalba Neri.\n\nIt packs a cololorful and evocative cinematography in terrific locations from Tonino Delli Colli, Pasolini&apos; s ordinary cameraman . And atmospheric musical score in jazzy style of the sixties and seventies by Piero Piccioni . This motion picture titled OSS 117 murder for sale or No flowers for OSS 117 (or one of the other half dozen names this movie goes by) was regular but professionally directed by Andre Hunebelle , and it definitively worth checking out if you are a fan of Euro spy genre . Andre was a craftsman who used to direct to Kerwin Matthews , Jean Marais and Louis De Funes in various films ; as he made several watchable pictures of all kinds of genres as drama , comedies such as : Casino de Paris , Massacre Dentellos ; adventures , Swashbucklers , many of them starred by Jean Marais : 3 musketeers , Return 3 Musketeers , Mysteries Paris , The hunchback , The captain , Les Charlots mousquetaires , Adventures Cadet Rouselle , Mission Tanger , and especially known for Fantomas Trilogy : Fantomas , Fantomas returns and Fantomas vs Scotland Yard .\n\nThe series based on novels written by Jean Bruce begin with &quot;0SS is not dead&quot;1955 by Jean Sacha with Ivan Desny , Magali Noel. &quot; 0ss 117 unleashed&quot; by Andre Hunebelle with Kerwin Matthews, Irina Demick . &quot; Panic in Bangkok&quot; 1964 by Andre Hunebelle with Kerwin Matthews , Robert Hossein , Pier Angeli. &quot;Oss 117 Fury in Bahia&quot; 1965 with Frederick Strafford , Raymond Pellegrin, Mylene Demengeot. &quot;Oss 117 Terror in Tokyo&quot; 1966 by Michral Boisrond with Frederick Stafford, Marina Vlady .&quot;Oss117 Vendetta of spies&quot; 1979 by Pierre Kalfon with Luc Merenda ,Elsa Martinelli , Genevieve Grad. &quot;Oss117 Tue Le Taon&quot; 1971 by Andre Leroix with Alan Scott. And &quot;Oss 117 El Cairo nest of spies&quot; and &quot;Oss 117 lost in Rio&quot; by Michael Hazanavicious with Jean Dujardin , Beatriz Bejo.",

      "reviewBody": "I first watched Funny Games (US) and enjoyed it (well, thought it was a film I&apos;d like to watch again), so I bought it. However, half way through a second viewing, I decided I couldn&apos;t take any more and turned it off.\n\nSome may say that&apos;s a sure sign that it&apos;s a bad movie. They may be right - even its star Tim Roth has since refused to watch it. The film is actually an American version (filmed shot for shot) of an Austrian &apos;home invasion&apos; movie and is supposed to be about &apos;the nature of violence.&apos; I didn&apos;t know this when I first watched it and just looked at it as a horrific film which was deliberately quirky.\n\nIt&apos;s about a family who get held hostage in their own (holiday) home by two nasty - yet annoyingly polite - young psychopaths. The first time I watched it I stuck with it and thought it was interesting/different enough to warrant a second viewing. I guess the reason I turned it off is because it was just too frustrating to watch. I practically wanted to jump into the TV armed with a chainsaw and... well, I won&apos;t give too much away.\n\nIf you don&apos;t know about the film, I won&apos;t spoil the &apos;weirder&apos; bits. It&apos;s definitely not a horror film, as there isn&apos;t much blood and gore (what there is happens off screen). It&apos;s more an experience in frustration making statements about the audience&apos;s desire to witness blood and gore on the big screen. Now, some may say that&apos;s a bit pretentious and, if you feel this way, this film probably isn&apos;t for you.\n\nIf you want to watch this - be prepared for the least &apos;feel good&apos; film ever made. It&apos;s not a horror and it&apos;s not a thriller. It&apos;s simply an exercise in watching. It&apos;s different enough to rise above a lot of its fellow genre films, but may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea and is definitely hard to sit through.",

Online says it needs to be 12+. It happens very early on in the movie.\n\nLots of upset online about it\n\nAt minute 23 Greg makes a discovery in the linen closet .. this discovery could ruin Christmas for a lot of children.\n\nDisney+ should remove this show before the magic of Christmas is lost.\n\nHopefully word will spread about the spoiler to the adults before it reaches the school playgrounds.",

What we then see is during the whole movie the chase after Bourvil. Let&apos;s make it right from the start, we saw the great French comedian in much better movies and the hommage to slapstick from director Alex Joffe can work on your nerves as this is like some copy from a Buster Keatonmovie in colours, but as it often go with French movies, you tend to laugh.",

He decides he needs to find the beggar and apologize, so he goes on a quest, meeting a princess and the dwarf who wants to marry her.\n\nMadeline Brandeis&apos; film is largely populated by children who wander around a fairy tale landscape of woods, poverty, ugly old people and castles, with a few cute animals thrown in for audiences to ooh over. It has the rhythms and details of a fairy tale, and the editing is pretty good for 1918. Mrs. Brandeis would produce one other film, but her career seems to have moved into books, She would write a dozen or more childrens&apos; books, most of which would center around a youngster who is called &quot;Little&quot; in the title. She would die in 1937 at age 39.",

However, when PJ jumps with his skateboard, there is an unexpected accident and PJ dies. The group stays together and makes a covenant to keep their secret. One year later, Amber receives messages in her cell-phone telling that &quot;I&apos;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and she gathers her friends to find who might have told about their prank. They find that PJ&apos;s cousin Lance (Ben Easter) also knows what they did. Sooner they find that a dark man wearing slicker is chasing them with a hook to kill each one of them.\n\n&quot;I&apos;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; is an unoriginal collection of clichés. The forgettable story is very weak and a rip-off of the two other movies, only worse. The deaths are not original; the acting is average; the situations are predictable in accordance with the worse clichés of the genre and the conclusion is awful. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Eu Sempre Vou Saber o Que Vocês Fizeram no Verão Passado&quot; (&quot;I Will Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "... and yet it has grown on me to where it is one of my favorites.\n\nWhen I first saw this in the theater I felt disappointed and baited and switched. Robin Williams may be top billed, but he is not the center of the film although he is the motivating character. He is a new teacher at an elite private school for boys that has traditions that probably nobody remembers the reasons for. Williams&apos; character is out of step with the rest of the faculty at the school and encourages his students to seize the day. Anyone who grew up with the overbearing-we-expect-more-out-of-you parents, or even attended boarding school, or grew up in some similar environment can identify with the students in the film.\n\nEvery aspect of this film is powerful. From screenplay to direction, casting to acting, the movie drags us into a world of teenagers that are REAL. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes rebellious ... sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. This is very much a Peter Weir film. The screenplay is one the most powerful ones ever, and one characteristic of this movie is the evolution the characters go through. Just like Truman Show, Witness, The Last Wave and Fearless, Weir drags his characters into the story and changes them. He evolves them so that, in the end, his characters are more human and feel something beyond traditional beliefs and codes; Things that people have died for throughout history: Freedom, Respect, Pride... things that may not be that important to an average person, things that make one a hero.",

      "reviewBody": "The Heroes of Telemark is based on a real-life story. It follows a unit of the Norweigan resistance in their efforts to destroy a German occupied factory, where the Germans are drawing near to creating the first atomic bomb. Kirk Douglas plays an academic from the University of Oslo who is brought in to help them because he is an expert on atomic science. Richard Harris plays the leader of the resistance fighters, a strong willed and courageous man who is always thinking of the best way to be a thorn in the side of the Nazis. There are other decent characterisations too, such as Ulla Jacobsen as Douglas&apos;s ex-wife (they parted because he seduced one of his students) and Eric Porter as a power hungry Nazi.\n\nThe film is quite good, but it might have been better still. For much of the running time, it seems curiously subdued, with lots of scenes which don&apos;t quite screw home the tension as far as they could. The sequence in which the resistance fighters infiltrate the factory and attempt to destroy the German&apos;s heavy water supply should have been unbearably tense, but it kind of comes and goes without generating the necessary atmosphere. The closing sequence aboard a boat full of children is very well done, though, and there&apos;s another taut bit where Douglas and Jacobsen are almost caught snooping around the factory but manage to convince a passing guard that they are merely  young lovebirds trying to find a quiet spot for a bit of private love-making.\n\nThe Heroes of Telemark tells a worthy story and is reasonably entertaining, but it could have been a touch better if the maker&apos;s had concentrated slightly harder on the suspense."

I was expecting more of drama, less of farce, however, it came together at the very end. The second part of the movie seemed to be much more exciting and framed with details than the first one, as the first part left me irritated with its lack of focus. You need to be prepared to overcome all the irritation this movie presents you with as I believe this is one of its intentions - make you feel powerless to accelerate its speed or change the characters&apos; minds. Lots of details are nationally specific and you need to know something about Russia and Russians to understand certain parts of it. Overall - specific enough to be a bold attempt to produce modern art.",

The plot kept bringing in new characters, and characters whom you thought were the main ones, disappear for 30 minutes or disappear altogether. There&apos;s the blonde girl, but apparently she&apos;s not the main girl (Kathleen Beller) whom the apparent hero has a love interest in. I was super confused the whole movie and it could not keep my attention. I know it should be a good film, since it falls into the illustrious category of &apos;80s sword-and-sorcery, but it made no sense to me. It felt as if THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING had broken into many different subplots and sub-groups, crossed with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, but to compare this movie with them only sullies their reputation. Honestly, DEATHSTALKER II (1987) makes more sense and is funnier."

In Lagrimas Negras, we hear contagiously nostalgic tales that are personal individual recounts by the fathers of Cuban music but that also give us an overall idea of the history of the island&apos;s electrifying rhythms. The faces and movements of these masters, most of them in their 90&apos;s, tell an epic story in themselves. We then follow them as the legendary Guarachera Cubana as they reunite, rehearse and go on tour as far the netherlands, sharing their experiences and giving us their authentic, incredibly heart-felt  music. Unlike Wim Wenders&apos;s cold dv handheld camera, Lagrimas Negras has beautiful film cinematography which brings closer the warm amber tones and enchanting visuals found in the mecca del son Cubano ! An wonderful film about wonderful music!",

When one watches a Nico Mastorakis film one doesn&apos;t expect a logical story or likable characters or any semblance of a good movie. Those that watch Mastorakis&apos;s films are pretty much sexists who like to test their endurance of crap.

The two leads provide breathtakingly awful acting. There&apos;s enough molasses-slow pacing here to make one those lethargic 50&apos;s era B-movies seem like an amphetamine commercial directed by Tony Scott. Of course that&apos;s only when new-wave punk 80&apos;s band members aren&apos;t blowing each other across the screen. Blowing up. I meant to say blowing each other up. \n\nIf you are a cult film fan, then all the pain you have to endure with a movie like this is just part of the fun. For the rest of us... well, bring one of those bags the airlines keep in the back of every seat. You&apos;ll need it for scenes with lines such as, &quot;...that was our first encounter with disco mutants. I was sure it wouldn&apos;t be our last.&quot;\n\nI would only recommend this if you and your friends get high every day and enjoy watching popcorn pop.

This was potentially a funny movie, but it just didn&apos;t quite make it. Perhaps the continual narrative by Ackroyd did not help. The standard of acting was reasonable. The standard of direction was reasonable. The story was reasonable and had the potential of making a good movie. The 91 minutes of run time seemed more like 180 minutes. The movie was too drawn out and the comedy was too little and not funny enough. Of all the actors, I thought that Lily Tomlin gave the best performance. Ackroyd was OK, but as his was the main role, it was going to take more than OK to make the movie good. Jack Lemmon was unimpressive and his accent unconvincing. I gave it 5 from 10, and that was probably being generous.",

A place where children cannot go to secondary school because they don&apos;t have the $10 per term. This is Malawi.\n\nMalawi is also a country of 12 million people, where one million are children who are orphans because their parents have died of AIDS. This film makes it extremely difficult to face these children and not feel that they are worse off than anywhere else in the world.\n\nHowever, it would not be a great film if that is all it did. Despite the poverty and disease and the clinging to destructive traditions and the superstitions, the film presents hope for these children and the country.\n\nIt also presents lessons for us. As JFK said &quot;Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children&apos;s future. And we are all mortal.&quot; Malawi is looking for help, not a handout. They are being educated in accepting their own responsibility for their lives. Something that is lacking in so many of our neighbors who always blame others for their misfortune. They use this inner strength to smile and laugh and sing in the face of abject poverty. They need our help to overcome their problems and grow their own country.\n\nThe seeds are being planted, but the need to assist is presented in a film that should move all.\n\nThank you, Madonna, for bringing this to us.",

      "reviewBody": "The story opens with bustling realism depicting the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria at the start of World War I when Austria and Hungary were divided by political storms. WALTER HUSTON, as a Hungarian mayor, gets initial prominence in the early scenes, with KAY FRANCIS as his wife who is hiding some Serbians from Austrian authorities and who catches the watchful eye of NILS ASTHER, an Austrian officer.\n\nIt soon becomes apparent that this is going to be a rather heavy-handed love story (with some pathetic attempts at humor) involving these three against a background of tumultuous political events while KAY FRANCIS and NILS ASTHER have a fling at romantic moments that look like they&apos;re straight out of a tear-jerker from silent films. There&apos;s even a bit of the smokehouse ham in WALTER HUSTON&apos;s performance.\n\nMiss Francis was never a great actress and she needs all her wiles here to make her role as Huston&apos;s wife even remotely credible. That she fails is evident from her first appearance and she looks uncomfortable in her period costumes.\n\nOf course, I may be biased. I never did like KAY FRANCIS nor was I able to see her creating a real or likable character in any role she played. Since this is not a typical Francis film, it&apos;s a bit more tolerable than most, except for some extravagant overacting in &apos;30s fashion.\n\nIt&apos;s a film that goes steadily downhill after the well staged opening of the assassination--straining for a sense of excitement and importance but it fails miserably to connect. Lush production values can&apos;t hide a mawkishly sentimental script and another teary role for Miss Francis as the wife in love with another man.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the fact that the technicolor location photography is great, John Wayne and Laraine Day have to deal with a script that is way too long (2 hrs. 8 min.) for the kind of romantic adventure seen here. One of the chief compensations for the overlong film, is seeing Laraine Day look lovelier than ever in technicolor. But other than that, the script is too long-winded and lacks enough action or drama to sustain itself over the long running time. \n\nLet me quote from my &quot;LARAINE DAY: All-American Girl&quot; article that appears in the Spring 2001 issue of FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE:\n\n&quot;&apos;Tycoon&apos; is a spectacular action-romance co-starring her with John Wayne in which he carried most of the film. Once again, she was easy on the eyes in technicolor as a woman in love with a railroad constructor (Wayne) in conflict with his employer over construction of tracks through the Andes mountains. She handled the role capably enough but it was one that any young actress could have played and offered no new challenges.&quot;\n\nThe nice supporting cast included Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Judith Anderson, James Gleason and Anthony Quinn. It passes the time, but don&apos;t expect anything much."

When the two are to be separated, Herr Josef loses all will to go on living.\n\nHans Moser, a native Viennese, was one of the Old German Cinema&apos;s most popular stars, with a career spanning at least 30 years; appearing mainly in &quot;mistaken identity&quot; comedies, and occasionally singing a song or two. His 1940s tune &quot;Die Reblaus&quot; is still a well recognized song today.\n\nFans will enjoy this mellow Sunday afternoon family fare, and perhaps shed a few tears. This is not a big budget blockbuster, just a pleasant double-helping of good old German &quot;Schmalz&quot;.",

Queen Latifah plays smart-mouthed cabbie with a souped-up vehicle in New York City who inadvertently partners with stumble bum cop Jimmy Fallon to crack a major crime case. Film should have relied more on Latifah&apos;s natural sass and less on Fallon&apos;s white-bread, dim-witted act (race is a constant punchline in the script, and Fallon is just there as Exhibit A). Jennifer Esposito is wonderful as a no-nonsense police lieutenant, Ann-Margret is a stitch as Fallon&apos;s tippling mother, and John Sierros (Broadway actor shamefully credited as &apos;Fat Cop&apos;) shines as a bamboozled police officer, but what happened to Queen Latifah? She gets a few good cracks in, but there&apos;s no character here for her to play; she sticks to her sarcastic persona and puts everyone down, but her role is depressingly one-dimensional. Comedy has a fast pace, impressive cinematography (although the swooping crane shots in traffic get repetitive) and some good car chases, but the screenplay needed an overhaul. ** from ****",

In fact, while Fonda&apos;s men are evil incarnate, Fonda&apos;s character is more nuanced and complex, and he is as much a victim of his choices and the men he chooses to &quot;lead&quot; as the townspeople they terrorize. In fact, if the movie has a dominant theme, it would be about how people become trapped by their own fears and doubts, and can only break out of their personal prisons by finding the courage to face their fears and overcome them. The movie is dark, and borrows elements from many earlier westerns; especially High Noon. It is not relentlessly negative however, and ends on a positive and life affirming note. While the pace is slow and the plot is derivative, the performances, particularly Stewart&apos;s and Fonda&apos;s, are superb and make the movie worth watching. The supporting case is a who&apos;s who of wonderful character actors and actresses.",

      "name": "dazzling performance by Julia Roberts",
      "reviewBody": "In its story, `Erin Brockovich&apos; breaks little new ground.  Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,&apos; `The Insider,&apos; `A Civil Action,&apos; `The Rainmaker,&apos; among others, each of which tells the tale of a common `David&apos; (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath.  All the above five films expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as well as the residents who live near the companies&apos; facilities.  In the case of  `Erin Brockovich,&apos; the villain is the PG&amp;E electrical plant located in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California.  It seems that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that PG&amp;E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at their site.  The company has even brought in medical professionals and toxicologists to assuage the residents&apos; growing fears.  Almost by chance, Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&amp;E&apos;s gross malfeasance in the process.\n\nLooking at its bare-boned plotting, one must concede that there really isn&apos;t much that is new here.  However, thanks to a pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph.  This may, in fact, be not only Roberts&apos; best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine.  First of all, she is often abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor.  Dressed more like a fashion devotee of Roberts&apos; `Pretty Woman&apos; call girl character than a serious legal executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion.  Yet, it is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the people she is trying so desperately to help.  A twice-divorced mother of three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in the defense of her case.  Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of internal contradictions.  Much as she loves her children, she has made a shambles of her life in recent years.  Rootless and lacking the skills necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a traffic accident case.  Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down her rhetoric or her temper  or to adopt the more `professional&apos; attire of the business world  even if it might mean that she would be taken more seriously by those around her.  She assumes that no man would be willing to consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is fighting begin to drive him away  and her children as well.  Most fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an issue.  All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of believable paradoxes.  Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality, wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth.  Grant, by making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may be.\n\nAnd, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly.  Never before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action and statement.  She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this complex woman.  This is definitely Oscar-caliber work.  Equally brilliant is Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial, easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&amp;E but the seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case.  One of Erin&apos;s most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity harridan  a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does us.\n\nIf `Erin Brockovich&apos; has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin&apos;s romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door.  He seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin&apos;s life to make her portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting and believable part of the tale.  We feel we are being too often distracted from the meaty center of the story.\n\nStill, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so beautifully on so many levels.  As Erin Brockovich, Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night."

They were spouting out such utter nonsense unfitting to the scene &amp; circumstances, that there was an immediate dislike and aggravation, from me and the one I was watching with.\n\nWe still watched it till the end, enduring one idiotic and nonsensical scene after the next, just to see where it ends up.\n\nAnd it was an cringed-facepalm watch throughout.\n\nI never expected it to be such an bad movie, especially not with such an starring cast.",

The movie feels very cold and remote, almost Kubrickian in content and style.  Surprisingly, there is very little violence in the film although it seems like that the film is very brutal.  Perhaps this is because of emotional hopelessness most of the characters experience in the film.  A very worthwhile experience overall, rent it, although just don&apos;t be prepared to come away smiling.",

The story is, and perhaps war is.\n\nThe story is told in three parts, with highly ironic titles: Words, Faces, and Pictures. Each story has meticulously planned, but highly disturbing parallels. The story-telling of the movie requires diligent planning, down to every single detail, exceptional creativity, and extraordinary persistence. Perhaps that&apos;s why the director Milcho Manchevski was fired by both commercial producers Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox for &quot;creative differences&quot;\n\nBefore the Rain talks about hate, and how the power of hate can rise above love. It talks about taking sides, the central character in each section tries not to take sides, but circumstances often prove such efforts futile. As with Kiril and Aleksander.\n\nIn the film, all events happened before the rain, this sense of urgency, this beautiful sadness, and this inevitable tragedy. Before the Rain is my all time favourite movie.",

An angel from heaven (Victoria Abril) and an angel from hell (some Spanish chick named Penélope Cruz...lol!} fight over the soul of a brutish boxer (Demiån Bichir). The way the plot develops is predictable, as is the ending. But there are laughs around the way, most of them provided by Cruz. I can&apos;t begin to comprehend why she&apos;s such a dull, tedious, unconvincing actress in American films when she&apos;s proved to be such a vibrant, energetic and entertaining actress in Spanish films. And while she&apos;s made better films (BELLE EPOQUE, JAMON JAMON, LIVE FLESH, ABRE LOS OJOS and even the American ABRE remake VANILLA SKY), I think this is definitely her best performance yet. Her character is the most interesting and entertaining figure during the entire duration of the film, and one of the reasons she gets the biggest laughs is because the screenwriter gave her most of the best lines. The ridiculously talented and versatile Gael Garcia Bernal is a total hoot as a top CEO in hell who&apos;s a mix of Spike from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and Tony Shalhoub&apos;s eccentric shyster in THE MAN WHO WASN&apos;T THERE. He&apos;s so much fun that the movie is hurt because he&apos;s a supporting character who only appears in a few scenes, and so many of the lead characters are so one-note and tiring we keep waiting for him to show up more to liven things up. Anyways, this isn&apos;t a very good film, certainly one you may not remember for a long, but the good aspects in it kept me entertained...most of the time. B-",

It was like a ghastly car wreck, I knew I shouldn&apos;t look...but I couldn&apos;t help myself. For me, the most hilarious element of the movie was the fact that they couldn&apos;t afford professional stunt people, so these poor actors (I use the term &quot;actor&quot; loosely) had to do their own stunts!!! And believe me, when you see Grade D actors doing their own stunts, it&apos;s pretty funny to watch. My wife and I were rolling on the ground with laughter at the terribly choreographed fight scenes and special effects.  There&apos;s one scene where Jan Michael Vincent tries to do a &quot;wheel kick&quot; to take down a terrorist and he literally stumbles and falls onto the guy! And they didn&apos;t edit it out!  LOL For me, &quot;Deadly Heroes&quot; (even the title is hilarious) has become the contemporary &quot;Plan Nine From Outer Space,&quot; in that they take it so seriously...and yet it&apos;s such an amateurish train wreck. If you appreciate truly bad dialogue, you&apos;ll love this film.   Pretty much every third line is an &quot;oucher.&quot; I&apos;m going to try and find this film on video and invite some friends over for a hoot of a time.  If you&apos;re the type that enjoys movies that are so bad they&apos;re good, I highly recommend this film. Cheers!"

His men take Hoshino to be killed at the docks where he is rescued by vampire Miyako. She shares her blood with him to save him and thereby turning him.\n\nThis is trying to be a stylish Gothic vampire movie. The film moves way too slowly. The action style is lacking. It would have been cool back in the 80s or 90s. It doesn&apos;t look nearly as cool for action of today. The acting is mostly wooden. It&apos;s a low budget action wannabe but it fails to live up to its ambitions. The film is generous with its blood flow. However, it is so slow that the tension never gets that high.",

Although the film is well crafted with believable performances and solid production value, the story is a depressingly misanthropic satire in which no one has a good word to say to anyone during the entire run leaving us, the audience, detached and with no one to care about. The result is a less than satisfying watch with a bad after taste, when combined with lots of inconsequential dialogue and, hence, subtitle reading will make for a less than desirable watch for most. Only for French film fanatics who don&apos;t mind lots of graphic gay sex. (B-)",

It&apos;s a good example of the seventies&apos; films that trust the spectator and give away only little information on the characters&apos; backgrounds and their destination in life. The film comes close to Brechtian alienation effect and there&apos;s simply no one to get deeply interested in. Hence the film shifts the spectator to watch closely for the political undertones and subtle messages. There&apos;s also the rhythm of the falcon training and the dull imagery of the Hungarian pusta which add to the overall experience.\n\nThe film seemed to be to many quite compelling. I chatted for a while with a friend of mine and she said: &quot;What was the meaning of that?&quot; I think it&apos;s best - as the previous (and only!) commentator said - to interpret THE FALCONS as a satire on the Communist system. The film has pretty weird, almost surrealist symbolism for which there&apos;s no explanations or easy give-aways, but then again Gaál has said himself that he&apos;s not interested in substance, only in structure. Maybe this was the only way he got his films made in the Socialist Hungary. I hope this film would be released as a good quality DVD. The old 35mm copy I saw yesterday was full of scratches and the colours were faded. There were two subtitles: in English and in Finnish. The English ones were at the bottom of the screen and the Finnish ones were in the middle!",

      "reviewBody": "*Warning* This review contains mild spoilers to the GAME, but not the movie.\n\nA dig in the nevada desert have found a portal to an ancient city on mars. Since then, scientists have struggled 20 years to find out more about the civilization that built the city and why they disappeared.\n\nApparently they found something. In an emergency transmission sent from the science facility on mars a head scientist explains that there is a &quot;level 5 breach&quot; and quarantine procedures must be implemented immediately. A squad of elite soldiers are sent to the science facility on Mars to protect and retrieve property and make sure quarantine is kept. What they find is naturally more than they are trained and equipped for.\n\nThis is another game that made it into the silver screen, and the DOOM franchise isn&apos;t exactly known for it&apos;s multi-depth story lines. This made me seek out and watch this movie with plenty of ice in my stomach, ready to forgive the producers for mistakes they made.\n\nAnd mistakes were made. The greatest one was of course to change the entire plot. As a gamer who put more value in story than the action, I would personally say that the DOOM3 storyline was better than the movies (completely changed) storyline. In the game the city plays a central role. In the movie you never leave the work areas, you never get to see the old ruins. The city isn&apos;t even mentioned beyond the intro. Beyond 2 &lt;10 second scenes, you do not see the Mars exterior. You barely register that these events take place on Mars, not on earth. The artifacts that played a central role in the game is not mentioned or present in the movie. The entire &quot;Hell is loose&quot; plot was completely cut away, the events of the movie blamed onto something *COMPLETELY* different. The theme &quot;one man against hell&quot; became &quot;a few men and their issues&quot;. The ghost of the little girl (one of the games scarier parts) did not make it to the move.\n\nDOOM3 was also a horror experience playing both on achluophobia (fear of darkness) and Monophobia (fear of being alone), this was an aspect missing in the movie where areas was lit and the characters was always going at least two and two. I almost think the movie could have been better if they hired less actors and put more money on storywriters.\n\nAnother aspect completely gone is the ambient red tone of being on mars, something that could have added a more artistic flavor to the movie. Except for very short moments in the beginning of the movie you never see that these events in fact take place on mars.\n\nI was not happy to see the storyline almost completely changed and the horror downscaled to almost not scary at all with nothing better added to it. There are no deep questions asked here, no philosophical submessage to the audience to go home thinking about. This is a lighthearted actionmovie and that&apos;s it.\n\nThe most faithful part (to the game) is the labs and the monsters. he developers who made the game gave the areas/monsters/weapons an unique design that wouldn&apos;t have been right to move away from. If you care zero about the plot, then yes this is DOOM.\n\nThere&apos;s also the first person sequence in which we get to follow a series of events through the eyes of a soldier when he runs around and shoot monsters in corridors. It was fun, although I would say that it failed to capture me. I was mostly annoyed with the choice of music and it could have been more scary.\n\nI see some ways this movie could have been made better with the material it&apos;s based on, but I did not expect it. At least the action is well done. If you want 2 hours of entertainment that wont change your world, DOOM offers just that. If you do not watch many movies and want some extra quality when spending time on one, you can jump this one.\n\nGame-movies so far are between &quot;awful&quot; and &quot;ok&quot;. This one was &quot;ok&quot;.",

The script itself is diabolical and it is shocking that this even raised any funding. If it were made for the estimated £400,000 then that&apos;s £399,999 too much! I&apos;ve seen student films that have been better made on lower budgets.\n\nI hope this doesn&apos;t impact too heavily on the careers on Gary Mavers, Claire Spence, Tom Cotcher or Joseph Millson who tried to perform with terrible lines.\n\nAs they say you can&apos;t make a silk purse out of a sows ear.",

Although the film offers little that could not be found in its prequel, it is somewhat better made, efficently exploiting dentophobia and riffing on the trust involved in a doctor-patient relationship. For the gorehounds, suffice to say three of the four people I watched this with walked out in disgust: taking the place of traditional death sequences are gleeful bouts of unanaesthetised dental destruction, performed with the aid of convincing models in unflinching close up. By this second outing Corbin Bernstein is really inhabiting the role of Dr. Feinstone, and his affectionately campy turn provides the film with much of its drive and humour. in one hilarious sequence he desperately admonishes himself in the shower: &quot;nutCASE, nutBALL, wacko, loony...&quot;\n\nThough self evidently not to all tastes, this film certainly hits a nerve (sorry, that was accidental) and is made with some intelligence and respect for its intended audience. check."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just finished watching this Estonian drama, and even though I&apos;ve been warned about what I should expect, I never imagined what awaits for me. Believe me, I&apos;m not a person who can be easily shocked - after hundreds and hundreds of movies I didn&apos;t think that something could bring me to this mental condition, but I&apos;m sitting here, in front of monitor; my hand are shaking a little and I&apos;m filled with so much rage and despair that I wanna cry. First of all, I should mention that I, myself, experienced something similar in my school years. Though, not to this extent, of course. Undoubtedly this is partly the reason why I feel like this. I recollect things that happened to myself and when I think about what could have&apos;ve happened if some people from my past stepped just a little further in what they&apos;ve been doing - it just makes me shiver. All words, reactions and events are so shockingly colourable that it&apos;s almost feels like you&apos;re inside characters&apos; minds. Indifferent adults so messed up by life (be it cruel post-Soviet reality or personal issues) that it seems like they&apos;re living in some world of their own; and kids that desperately trying to understand what is going on around them - without hope and any help from anyone around. I&apos;ve seen it all be my own eyes: mindless faces that don&apos;t understand you at all. I&apos;ve heard all the words - sickening clichés that only make you feel worse. Sometimes the pressure is just to high and you brake up no matter how strong you are. Of course, there were other pretty frank movies concerning this matter - Larry Clarks&apos; Kids - raw and passionate - or Gus Van Sant&apos;s Elephant - plain and intentionally protocolistyc - just to name a few. But none, none was so close to describe a reality of this kind of situation - Klass takes you so deeply in the heart of youth&apos;s desperation that it seems like you won&apos;t be able to see a daylight again.",

Anthony Quinn is excellent as the hardbitten rancher who respects Douglas&apos; character more than anybody (and whose life he saved in their youth), but who behaves one as a protective father, and two as a man who is rich and powerful, and used to getting what he wants. Carolyn Jones is also great as a woman caught in the middle of the two men.\n\nNo cop-outs, no easily resolutions. Just a great movie with a great cast."

The style and delivery is VERY self-conscious and prosaic, with everyone declaiming their lines in a very &quot;noble&quot; fashion (sort of like the &quot;traditional&quot; delivery of Shakespeare).\n\nC Aubrey Smith is by far the most interesting performer in this story, his irascible nature adding some much-needed bite to the movie. Mickey Rooney is also very memorable, showing once again he was a very dynamic and versatile child actor, handling comic and dramatic scenes very well - even in the same film. The mark of a true consummate performer.\n\nI would rank him as a definite child prodigy. (You should also check him out in YOUNG TOM EDISON for another example of this)\n\nI actually think the 80s tele-movie with Ricky Shroder and Alec Guiness worked slightly better than this version does; the characters are a lot more casual in their delivery, and the story flows better. But this is a pretty good version on its own terms any rate.",

It is a film for people who aren&apos;t perturbed by a lack of surface glitz in science fiction, and can take on the underlying meanings about immortality or the fear of death that other films rarely raise. Some of it doesn&apos;t make sense, but only if you are not paying attention. In my view, it gets straight to the point without any polish, which some people are uncomfortable about in any artform. It is not made for Star Trek fans. It is a bleak and powerful story about a cabal of ineffectual immortals who play God to an inferior but more vigourous race, and who long for death yet cannot die. They stealthily invite one of these inferiors (Connery) into their midst to solve their problems. The final scenes are extremely striking, and are set to the 2nd movement of Beethoven&apos;s 7th symphony. **You just don&apos;t hear this symphony enough in the movies***. I recommend this film to anyone who likes science fiction with a small sf."

      "reviewBody": "PERRIER&apos;S BOUNTY is YET another clichéd gangster movie in which everyone is ripping each other off and there are no nice characters in sight. RED EYE&apos;s Cillian Murphy plays a low-rent scumbag who owes money to a local gangster, played with familiar relish by Brendan Gleeson. Cue loads of chases, manic situations, pursuing hit men and even a little romance with shoehorned-in love interest Jodie Whittaker.\n\nThis could be just another London-set gangster drama in the same vein as many a Guy Ritchie movie, but the fact that it&apos;s Irish sets it apart a little from the crowd - but only a little. For the most part, it&apos;s highly predictable, and although the story is fairly fast-moving and interesting, unfortunately the script is a letdown. It really falls apart when it comes to the father/son bonding scenes with an out-of-place Jim Broadbent; these are indescribably boring and seem to go on forever.\n\nHowever, fans of fantasy TV show GAME OF THRONES will be well served by the supporting cast; no less than four familiar faces from the programme appear here. There are minor parts for Francis Magee (Yoren) and Conleth Hill (Varys), and bigger, decent roles for Michael McElhatton (Roose Bolton) and Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos Seaworth). At least their presence was enough to keep me entertained for the majority of the running time...",

      "reviewBody": "I must admit that Clint Eastwood was the main reason why I watched this movie. I&apos;m already quite familiar with his work as an actor and as a director - even though I still haven&apos;t seen his biggest success &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; yet - and overall I can enjoy his work. Does that mean that I love all his movies? No, certainly not, but most of the time, he&apos;s the one who saves the movie, even when it isn&apos;t all that good. Knowing that he directed this movie and played a major role in it, only made it more interesting for me.\n\n&quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; shows how the world famous movie director John Huston is planning on making a trip to Africa, where he will shoot his next movie. But despite his reputation of being a good director, he is also a very difficult man to work with. He doesn&apos;t want to make any concessions towards the producers and to make things worse he is also more interested in shooting the biggest elephant possible than shooting his movie and there is nothing or no-one who can bring him to other ideas...\n\nOverall this is a good movie, although I must say that the beginning didn&apos;t do it for me. At first I had the feeling that the characters weren&apos;t all that real. They felt too much like caricatures, almost making this movie feel like a comedy, which it certainly isn&apos;t. That&apos;s also the reason why I wasn&apos;t exactly thinking about giving this movie a very high rating. But I always make that final decision at the end of the movie and I admit that the end of the movie was a lot better than the beginning. Not only was it very clear that John Wilson felt himself more at ease in Africa than in England, his reactions after the hunt also showed that this wasn&apos;t yet another typical type of quiet tough guy without any human emotions that Clint Eastwood plays so often. I really appreciated that in this movie. What I also liked was the entire &apos;behind the scenes of a classic movie&apos; idea. OK, if you regularly buy a DVD, then you know from the extra&apos;s how a movie is shot. But that&apos;s how it is done today with all the modern techniques, camera&apos;s, lighting equipment. They didn&apos;t have all that in the fifties and it&apos;s nice to see how it was done back then.\n\nOverall this is an enjoyable movie that offers some good acting and an interesting story. If the beginning had been more believable, this might well have become one of my all-time favorites. Now I give it a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "A homage to acclaimed 1979 Walter Hill film &quot;The Warriors&quot;,(it even features a subway car), done in Kaurismäki peculiar, Godard inspired style, &quot;Calamari Union&quot; shows a group of uniformed named man, as opposed to uniforms of gang colors, fighting their way through Helsinki, trying to get to the promised neighborhood of Eira, not their native, but wishful place of living, where &quot;there are no apartments&quot;. Along the way they meet and befall casualties to all sorts of transient enemies, asking for trouble as they go along. Their journey is futile, an attempt to overcome nonexistent and unseen boundaries, doomed from the start. Their resolve is even questionable and strong willed women are often derailing them from their unsure path, as the obstacles appear before them as a mirage.\n\nShot in typical Kaurismäki minimalist style, black &amp; white photography, improvised dialog on a loosely based script, &quot;Calamari Union&quot;, succeeds in bringing a viewer close to chaotic nature of the group&apos;s quest. This film is definitely worth repeated viewings, just for substance and style. Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "As I have mentioned in my post &quot;SheBlogger as a Reviewer of the Macabre&quot; (would be good to read that first before reading this review), I&apos;m always in the lookout for horror movies. I especially watch out for Filipino horror movies because I&apos;m hoping for some improvements (and I have seen a few already) in this genre. So when I first saw this movie on Facebook, I thought to myself, &quot;Wow! Another promising horror movie, not long after The Healing&quot;. Its Facebook page did not say much about the movie so I did not what exactly it is all about. I guess it&apos;s a marketing strategy to surround it with mystery. Even the poster didn&apos;t reveal much, but did suggest a lot of things to the imagination.\n\nI will not go into details of the story because I don&apos;t want to spoil it for those who haven&apos;t seen it yet. And the power of the movie is in the intricacy of the story. I don&apos;t do to others what I don&apos;t want others do unto me. I hate it when people purposely tell me the story of a movie I&apos;m planning to see. I would just tell you what I liked and did not like about the movie.\n\nFirst, I like the air of mystery given by the poster and the teaser trailer. It had me guessing if this is another psycho thriller wherein there is really no ghost killer other than the proverbial ghost in the past of the main character and that she is actually the killer. As it says in the trailer, &quot;is she a loving mother?&quot;, or a &quot;crazy mom?&quot;, or something to that effect. I don&apos;t remember the exact words. Hehe Anyway, it&apos;s an effective marketing strategy, if that&apos;s what it is. It caught my interest. However, I think the opening of the movie ruined that mystery. I will not tell you why or how. For me it just did. It removed all my doubts about the existence, or non-existence for that matter, of the ghost. It could have been better if that scene was placed somewhere in the middle or even just a bit later. Just not in the beginning of the story.\n\nBut still, the story was not completely revealed in that scene and my guessing continued every step of the way. And boy was I wrong in many guesses! I was wrong about who is who and who was dead or not. Although I was also correct in some instances. This is why I said the power of the movie lies in the story. I like thriller movies that keep me guessing and I like it when I&apos;m wrong, because it means the presentation of the narrative was very good. In this case, the twist was expected but it was not the twist I expected, if you get what I mean  I knew there would be a twist but I didn&apos;t guess it right.\n\nContinue reading on: http://heblogs-sheblogs.com/topics/arts-lit/",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; is one of those B-movies that despite cheesy one liners and incredulous situations, is a lot of fun.  The movie has a fast pace and Brandon Lee showed that he had screen prescence by stealing the show as a wise cracking Americanized, Asian American policeman joining Dolph Lundren&apos;s maverick cop who is well versed in the ancient ways of the Japanese Samurai.\n\nCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is excellent as the villain, Yashida and I have a sneaking supsicion that this was a fun film set.  The writing is not the best but I enjoyed myself watching this movie when I discovered it by accident when visiting Westwood in 1991 and years later as I watched it on DVD with some friends.\n\nDefinitely check it out and don&apos;t think too hard and go with the flow, this is one guilty pleasure."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Precz z zaplesniala elita wladzy!&quot; &quot;Do away with the moldy old governing elite!&quot; \n* Graffiti in Gdansk, 1981\n\n\nMass protests always seem to be about such basic things, e.g. stop killing us, or give us enough money so that we can feed ourselves, and here under Soviet communism it was the same. The context of Wajda&apos;s film is extraordinary, as it was made in 1981 during the heart of the Solidarity movement, and wove a fictional sequel to his &apos;Man of Marble&apos; amidst the real-life story of the Gdansk shipyard workers practically while it was taking place. In the documentary &apos;Wajda by Wajda,&apos; he explained the genesis of the film thusly: &quot;I entered the shipyard in August 1980, going from the gate to the room where the workers were deliberating. I was led by one of the shipyard workers with a white and red armband. He showed me into the room and said: &apos;Mr. Andrzej, make a movie about us!&apos;&quot;\n\nThe film shows the usual management responses to worker organization - the playbook never seems to change, just the characters/country/time in history - and it includes police brutality, corruption of the union bosses, propaganda (here leaflets dropped from an airplane instead of posted on the internet), provocation as a way of inciting violence and to put pressure on the unity of the group, and infiltration. It&apos;s amazing that a brief window in the evolution of the government allowed all of this to be shown, another in a string of remarkable successes for Wajda over his career in this regard.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the storytelling doesn&apos;t quite live up to the historical moment, and at 153 minutes, the film is too long. It was probably a mistake to first center it on the infiltrator, a man torn between both sides and whose desperate need for vodka seems to underscore how lost he is (at one point he breaks a bottle in the bathroom, and using a towel, soaks it up, wrings it out, and carefully avoiding broken glass, drinks it...ugh). We don&apos;t see Krystyna Janda&apos;s character until the 98 minute point, and even then it seemed a narrative mistake, as for the next 20-30 minutes we get a long flashback that for me was defocusing, including footage of her wedding, even if that did allow Lech Walesa to appear in another way. I think Wajda got a little bogged down in trying to tell the ending to &apos;Man of Marble&apos; the way he had wanted to, though I suppose in taking pains to do this, he illustrated the handing off a struggle from one generation to the next.\n\nWhere the film shines is in showing us these real moments of progress in Poland, and it has a place in Polish history for doing so. As the father (Birkut from the first film, now a shipyard worker) debates with son (a student, also played by Jerzy Radziwilowicz), his simple line &quot;No lie can last forever&quot; is incredibly moving. Later one of their elderly mothers says &quot;We are going to win. If not now, then next time,&quot; indicating dogged optimism and the need for sustained protest, over years and generations. When we see the real-life footage of interviews of striking workers and they talk about cost of living and one says &quot;They know that today workers aren&apos;t ignoramuses from the 18th century,&quot; it comes from a place of intelligence and courage. And lastly when we see the great Lech Walesa and his fellow members of the strike committee, it&apos;s powerful, powerful stuff. It gave me goosebumps when we first see him walking through a crowd, set to the acoustic guitar of Maciej Pietrzyk&apos;s &quot;Piosenka dla córki&quot; (Song for daughter). The ending, with Walesa being carried on the shoulders of protesters in the real-life story and the son honoring his father&apos;s makeshift grave in the fictional one, is very strong. Whatever his faults, Wajda again bore witness, and to have made the film in 1981 I think he was deserving of the awards he received.",

      "reviewBody": "BLONDIE (Columbia, 1938), directed by Frank R. Strayer, introduces Chic Young&apos;s famous comic strip characters, the Bumsteads, to the silver screen in the persona of Penny Singleton as Blondie; Arthur Lake as Dagwood Bumstead; Larry Simms as Baby Dumpling; and Jonathan Hale as Mr. J.C. Dithers. \n\nIn this series opener, Blondie, Dagwood and their four-year-old son they call Baby Dumpling, along with their dog, Daisy, live in a simple community going through their daily routines. Though simple enough, a chain of unfortunate events soon come one after the other at the time of Blondie and Dagwood&apos;s fifth wedding anniversary. Blondie starts the show by planning a surprise anniversary party and presenting Dagwood with the house of brand new furniture. While Dagwood is trying to impress his boss, Mr. Dithers, in trying to contact a very important client for the firm by waiting for him in the hotel lobby where he is staying, Dagwood befriends a middle-aged gentleman (Gene Lockhart) in trying to fix a broken down vacuum cleaner. Coming up to this man&apos;s room, Dagwood is introduced to the man he calls C.P., and his daughter, Elsie (Ann Doran), unaware that this is the man Dagwood must contact for the firm. Problems ensue when Blondie suspects Dagwood is having a secret rendezvous with an Elsie Watson, and mistakes CP&apos;s daughter to be that girl, considering Dagwood was seen with Elsie at the hotel by Blondie&apos;s former sweetheart, Chester Franey (Gordon Oliver). Chester shows up at the Bumsteads anniversary party, telling Blondie of the situation to Blondie at the gathering of guests consisting of Blondie&apos;s mother (Kathleen Lockhart), and sister, Dot (Dorothy Moore), leading to a World War battle. Poor Dagwood must get CP and his daughter to come to his house to straighten out everything, but more complications ensue. And yes, Dagwood gets fired for the first of many times on screen by Dithers.\n\nSetting the pattern in future film installments is Blondie getting jealous when she believes Dagwood is tangled with another woman; Dagwood running out of the house and running over the postman in order to catch his morning bus for work; and Alvin Fuddow (Danny Mummert), Baby Dumpling&apos;s &quot;genius&quot; friend, getting his chance to show off his smartness, etc. Supporting the cast are Irving Bacon as Mr. Beasley, the postman, the surname later changed to Crum in future installments); Fay Helm as Alvin&apos;s mother; Ian Wolfe as the courtroom judge, along with several other character actors. And let&apos;s not forget Daisy, the Bumstead dog, who is always the scene stealer. Fortunately, American Movie Classics, which premiered BLONDIE October 8, 1995, has restored its original theatrical opening and closing titles, starting with the Columbia logo, doing away with the tag-on opening and ending with the King Features logo and 1960s-style sing along theme by unknown vocalists that accompanied the movie and its sequels when distributed to local television in 1970. Interestingly, when shown on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: May 1, 2018), the cable channel that airs restored movie prints, reverted to the King Features opening from the 1970s instead. BLONDIE is an enjoyable entry that produced 27 more movie episodes, ending with 1950s BEWARE OF BLONDIE. One particular thing about the BLONDIE series is that the central characters are played by the same actors throughout the entire series. And no one can play Blondie and Dagwood better than Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. Sequel: BLONDIE MEETS THE BOSS (1939) (***)",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing the movie about 7 or 8 times, some of the laughs have worn out, but I still have fun watching it.  You can&apos;t completely negate a movie that involves a desperate man who tries to gain back the love of his fiance by jumping out of a plane dressed like Elvis.  The flying Elvises concept is definitely an original touch, but there are others as well.  I like the running gag involving Robert Costanzo suspecting that his fat, ugly wife is cheating on him with Mike Tyson because of obviously doctored photos of her and Iron Mike.  There&apos;s also that great scene with the 5-year-old Elvis impersonator, who&apos;s actually quite good.  Anne Bancroft makes a brief but funny appearance at the beginning of the film.  Peter Boyle also has a funny cameo as Chief Orman, an Indian Chief who has a love for showtunes.  James Caan gives his usually savvy performance.  I could&apos;ve done without the cliched fat henchman character, who basically repeats everything that Caan says and bumbles all over the place.  Nicolas Cage is over-the-top as the paranoid Jack, but his overacting works in the context of the film, and he&apos;s often very funny.  And finally, who can resist a film with tons of Elvis songs in the soundtrack?  \n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",

A great comedic tradition of Germany (and Austria) is the tradition of funny but also satirical (intelligent criticism in a funny/entertaining way) high school movies, like the ultimate classic &apos;The punch bowl&apos; featuring the wonderful Heinz Ruehmann in 1944, the Hans(i) Kraus stuff from the 1960ies and 1970ies up until recent successes like the F* ju Goethe (Suck me Shakespeare - not a fitting translation) - series. And this one is another example and a very well done one. I can&apos;t and won&apos;t conceal that I am biased since I have always been a huge fan of the most excellent Peter Alexander (but who isn&apos;t a fan of &quot;Peter the Great&quot;!), and consider me very happy having been able to meet him in person as a child at one of his shows. Beside his Count Bobby-movies (sometimes cheesy but always cute and funny, and also starring Gunther Philipp and Bill Ramsay) this is one of his best movies, witty, humourous, with a lot of charm of course, and also featuring the wonderful Theo Lingen, Gunther Philipp and Cornelia Froboess and cute songs (with funny lyrics and word changes). Although &apos;The punch bowl&apos; is absolute cult and the F* ju Goethe-stuff is hilarious, I guess this is my favorite back-to-highschool-movie. RIP, Peter Alexander, you were superb!",

      "reviewBody": "It comes as no revelation I am sure that Abel Gance was an avowed and unashamed admirer of Napoleon Buonaparte! Indeed his admiration for &apos;strong leaders&apos; prompted his support for Petain during the early years of the War and for de Gaulle in the 1960&apos;s. His &apos;reactionary&apos; politics need not concern us here. It must have been a great sadness to him that shortage of funds obliged him to sell his scenario of &apos;Napoleon on St. Helena&apos; to another director namely Lupu Pick. Napoleon&apos;s escape from Elba had such devastating consequences that after Waterloo his victors determined to make his next captivity his last and the rocky Isle of St. Helena in the South Atlantic was chosen. Accompanied by a few loyal supporters including General and Madame Bertrand and their children, Napoleon soon realised that this was not to be &apos;exile&apos; but &apos;house arrest&apos;. This is a far more subdued and straightforward film than Gance himself would have made and in some ways resembles the &apos;Chamber Play&apos; vehicles of which Pick was the undisputed master. Werner Krauss, one of Germany&apos;s greatest and ultimately one of its most controversial actors, is Napoleon, a man whose initial arrogance is worn away by having six long years to reflect on what he was and what he has become. &apos;Power&apos; is after all a drug and the withdrawal symptoms unpleasant. Needless to say Gance&apos;s script portays him as an heroic, stoical figure who is the victim of &apos;Perfidious Albion&apos; in the person of Governor Hudson Lowe who has the unenviable task of being a glorified gaoler. He is played by Albert Bassermann who excels in a thoroughly umsympathetic part. Lowe was referred to by Wellington as &apos;a stupid man&apos; and his excess of zeal in carrying out his orders to the letter certainly hastened Napoleon&apos;s demise. Prisoner and gaoler only met half a dozen times is as many years and their scenes together, though brief, are effective. Excellent use is made here of Beethoven&apos;s &apos;Eroica&apos; symphony. Ironically Napoleon was the original dedicatee but when Beethoven heard that the First Consul had declared himself Emperor he scratched out the dedication and declared that Napoleon would soon trample the rights of man underfoot and become a tyrant. This prophecy serves to remind us that Napoleon probably got his just desserts. Beethoven&apos;s music will last forever whilst tyrants rise and fall. Although not in the same league as his &apos;Shattered&apos; and &apos;New Years Eve&apos; this talented director has given us a fine film with many features of interest. Sadly Lupu Pick died of poisoning in 1931.",

      "reviewBody": "On the Town is one great fast moving musical, one in which the dance is supreme. Not surprising because this is the first film that Gene Kelly had total creative control over. \n\nOn the Town ran for 462 performances on Broadway from December, 1944 to February, 1946 and it&apos;s score was composed by Leonard Bernstein with lyrics by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Naturally the book included some topical war time references for 1944 which were eliminated in 1949. So was about half of Bernstein&apos;s score, but Comden and Green wrote the lyrics for the new songs also with Roger Edens. That certainly helped keep the continuity.\n\nOf course the signature song of the Broadway score, New York, New York was kept. The rest of the score is really not all that great in terms of marketability. But Kelly was interested in giving the dance center stage in this film and he succeeded admirably. \n\nOf course of the six principals in the cast he had both Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen, a pair of very good dancers to help. \n\nThe plot of On the Town is threadbare. Three sailors, Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin get 24 hour shore leave and they are determined to experience as much New York as they can. That opening number with the men pouring out of the ship on the Brooklyn Navy Yard dock is unforgettable and then Kelly, Sinatra, and Munshin singing and dancing New York, New York. \n\nMunshin attracts the attention of Ann Miller who finds his resemblance to a caveman recreation astounding. Her big moment on the screen is tap dancing to Primitive Man ending with Munshin destroying one of the dinosaur skeletons in the Museum of Natural History.\n\nThis was Munshin&apos;s third film after MGM signed him up for a small role in Easter Parade. He was a borscht belt comedian who got his big break on Broadway in Call Me Mister. With Sinatra and Kelly in Take Me Out to the Ballgame before On the Town, he was a pretty funny fellow. He spent his career equally between the stage, screen, and later television. Perhaps it&apos;s why he&apos;s not really remembered today by film fans that much.\n\nSinatra catches the eye of cabdriver Betty Garrett. One big reason for rewriting the score was in the original play there was no ballad for Sinatra&apos;s character. Besides the ensemble numbers, Sinatra and Garrett sing Come Up to My Place from the original score and You&apos;re Awful, Awful Nice to be with. Nothing terribly memorable, in fact Frank never recorded any of the material from On the Town. But to have in the film and not give him one ballad would have been ridiculous.\n\nIt&apos;s the dance numbers that make On the Town. Besides the ones previously mentioned, Kelly and Vera-Ellen do a salute to their common small town in Main Street and there is the lengthy A Day in New York ballet. The year before Kelly had shown what he was really capable of creating in the Slaughter on Tenth Avenue ballet in Words and Music. Now that he had complete creative control and he made maximum use of it. Of course this was nothing compared to what he was to create in later films.\n\nVera-Ellen probably is best known for being Rosemary Clooney&apos;s sister in White Christmas. But she&apos;s shown to far better advantage here. I&apos;m surprised Kelly did not team with her more often. \n\nOn the Town is really helped a lot by the location shooting in New York. Director Stanley Donen very skillfully blended his shots of well known New York landmarks like the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Brooklyn Bridge, Wall Street, Columbus Circle with the later interiors done on the MGM soundstage. Really great job of editing.\n\nTo see New York in 1949 you couldn&apos;t ask for three better guides than those sailors on a 24 hour pass.",

      "reviewBody": "Watchable Western programmer of the most elementary kind, this was actually culled from episodes of an obscure TV series THE TRAVELS OF JAMIE McPHEETERS. Charles Bronson is O.K. as the taciturn hero (though obviously far away from the mythic quality of his &quot;Harmonica&quot; character in Sergio Leone&apos;s ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST [1968], the masterpiece which belatedly shot him to stardom), Kurt Russell is the likable boy in his charge and Douglas Fowley plays an eccentric old prospector whom the latter befriends (eventually becoming his beneficiary).\n\nThe narrative presents a HIGH NOON (1952)-type situation where Bronson meets an old flame he believed dead and is then confronted by her husband (Bronson&apos;s nemesis back in the day) and his two brothers. While the quality of the transfer on the budget DVD I watched left a lot to be desired (including several unnatural transitions betraying its modest TV origins), the film itself manages a couple of good action climaxes.",

Time is the enemy, and The Bomb. How does it make you feel to be tricked? Maybe you deserve it.

Needless to say that I hadn&apos;t even heard about it prior to getting a chance to sit down and watch it. And with my interest in Asian horror, of course I needed no persuasion to spend time watching this movie.\n\nThe anthology is comprised of four different stories, which were all actually nicely interwoven with each other, which made for a very fulfilling storytelling. However, the movie just suffered terribly from having less than mediocre plotlines and not having the most convincing of acting performances or special effects.\n\nOf all the four segments - Flame, Revenge, Imprison and Haunting Motel - I personally enjoyed Haunting Motel the most. That was because it had the most interesting story and the most memorable acting performance. And the director, Poj Arnon, of Haunting Motel was actually managing to make the anthology bearable to watch.\n\nNow, for a horror anthology, then &quot;Still&quot; felt very flaccid and mundane, truth be told. There wasn&apos;t much of anything scary to be had in these stories, so for a seasoned horror veteran such as myself this wasn&apos;t particularly outstanding.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Still&quot; sadly lands on a mere three out of ten stars. I wanted to like the anthology, but it was just mostly a swing and a miss.",

The story seems to stick to the truth, as far as we know it, much of the way. This has a great plot that keeps you interested. The characters are well-developed, credible and consistent. The majority of the acting performances are marvelous. This has a grand feel to it, and an epic scope, and the sweeping orchestral score helps establish and maintain it. The writing is top-notch throughout. This has a solid pace, and the three hours hold few, if any, dull moments. The dialog is well-delivered and has some quite memorable lines. This has large-scale battle sequences, and they&apos;re well-done. The production values leave nothing to be desired, and everything looks and sounds exactly right. At no point does this feel like they ran out of budget somewhere, or had to use the second-best solution to an issue they faced. They don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore. Not the best of its kind, however it is definitely worth your time. I recommend this to anyone interested in this, be it for Rodrigo, Heston, or any other reason. 7/10",

Lane plays the local small-town sheriff&apos;s deputy, working on the case with FBI agent Randy Spears. She had a similar role in &quot;Without a Trace&quot; 3 years earlier.\n\nStormy only appears on screen briefly in a flashback that explains the killer&apos;s motivation. A solid femme supporting cast headed by Ava Vincent and Jessica Drake is on hand.\n\nI was disappointed that many prominent players in NonSex roles received no screen credit (or identification), but was able to spot Shelby Stevens (makeup lady on the crew) and my favorite Lauren Kain in a diner scene, Kain being memorable in Mandingo&apos;s best vignette of all time: in &quot;Once You Go Black 4&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "Oscar Wilde&apos;s play &quot;Lady Windermere&apos;s Fan&quot; isn&apos;t one of his best pieces of work, and this film, shortened to &quot;The Fan,&quot; isn&apos;t the best adaptation of it and has the unfortunate position of having been made in between two better-regarded filmed versions of two of Wilde&apos;s better-regarded masterpieces, the 1945 &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; based on the author&apos;s only novel and the 1952 &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; based on his most celebrated play. The 1945 film particularly is a beautiful piece of art and a near-perfect adaptation, as is Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s 1925 silent version of &quot;Lady Windermere&apos;s Fan.&quot;\n\nDespite the loss of Wilde&apos;s words, including the famous epigrams, Lubitsch&apos;s film retains the spirit of the playwright&apos;s wit visually. It even improves upon it, as the play is rather uneven in its holding up Victorian-age high society for ridicule while ultimately becoming itself rather VIctorian in its moralistic resolution of motherhood. A similar fault befalls this 1949 reworking. Its added present-day framing narrative, where Mrs. Erlynne and Lord Darlington, rather literally, take a walk down memory lane places Wilde&apos;s story as a quaint relic, but one filled with nostalgia, of better times before the country was ravished by war. This takes the satirical bite out of the comedy of manners, which, otherwise, the film follows rather faithfully at first--before its resolution falters even more than the original play into melodramatics. The film&apos;s latter acts are full of characters either yelling at each other or acting self-righteously, while the musical score is turned up to bombastic levels. Compare this to how Lubitsch&apos;s film managed to retain its light tone even while managing a more poignant scene of self-sacrifice.\n\nLike the 1925 version, as well as the 1916 one before it, &quot;The Fan&quot; &quot;opens up&quot; the play, which helps prevent it from appearing stagy, even though it looks like a B-picture in comparison to the 1945 prestige production &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; or to Lubitsch&apos;s version, with the director&apos;s characteristic insistence upon grand sets, including absurdly gigantic doors. I do like one shot in &quot;The Fan,&quot; in particular, though, which happens when the narration changes to Lord Darlington&apos;s memory: the camera moves from the present to the past as seen through a window. Besides the flashback structure, the remembered past begins before where the play started (as do the other film versions), and there are other added scenes of Mrs. Erlynne&apos;s interactions with the male characters and a fencing match, which serves to stage her scandalous effect on society. Much of this is very similar to the 1925 film despite being slightly altered. The fencing match, for instance, replaces a similarly-purposed scene at the horse track in the 1925 version, which itself was a bit of a reworking of a dog-show scene in the 1916 one. I&apos;m certainly not opposed to &quot;The Fan&quot; adapting earlier filmed versions as well as the play, but I don&apos;t think it does a very good job of it. The horse-track scene is impressively constructed in Lubitsch&apos;s film, with its series of looks and mocked gossiping underpinning a narrative based on dramatic irony and misconceptions. The fencing scene here, by contrast, is quite dull.\n\nThe acting is OK, I suppose, but the problem is that Wilde&apos;s characters were never much developed; originally, they come off as mouthpieces for the author&apos;s aphorisms, as variously stated by several different persons. Besides eliminating Wilde&apos;s words, the 1925 version helps to alleviate this with Irene Rich&apos;s Mrs. Erlynne, who follows in the tradition of the cinematic vamp, or flapper, type, as the play was updated to the then-modern day. Not so here. Even George Sanders, who is my favorite screen version of Lord Henry from Wilde&apos;s novel, cannot save Lord Darlington, who always seems to me to be quite a bore of a cad. Martina Hunt is rather surprisingly good in the more minor role of the Duchess, though, as the film gets some amusement out of her relationship with her obedient daughter, Agatha.",

      "name": "GODZILLA VS. MEGAGUIRUS  Middling Godzilla but better than G2000",
      "reviewBody": "The Godzilla series came to a dramatic end with the death of Godzilla (after 22 films and 41 years) in GODZILLA VS. DESTROYER (spelled in the U.S. release as DESTOROYAH) in 1995. The survival of little Godzilla, grown up from Baby Godzilla in the two previous films, paved the way for a sequel. Instead, sequel plans were squelched by Sony&apos;s planned American version, which came out in 1998, and Toho Pictures instead produced a series of three new Mothra movies. After Godzilla fans expressed supreme disappointment with the Hollywood remake, Toho revived the franchise in Japan with GODZILLA 2000, which dispensed with all of the history and events of every Godzilla movie since the first one and was touted by Toho as a sequel to the very first Godzilla movie (1954). Some Godzilla fans bought this and some didn&apos;t, causing great debate over the film&apos;s merits or lack thereof. Leaving aside the issue of where the film fits in the Godzilla timeline, G2K still came up short in the areas of monster battles and urban destruction. MEGAGUIRUS is a half-hearted effort to keep the franchise alive until someone can come up with new ideas. It offers a bit more action and urban rampage than G2K and features a couple of no-nonsense women as the leading characters. It has no real relation to any other Godzilla movies and simply treats Godzilla as a monster menace who needs to be stopped at all costs. \n\nThe military and government agencies charged with the task of stopping the Big G come up with a device called Dimension Tide that&apos;s designed to create a black hole that will presumably suck in Godzilla. In the course of testing it, they somehow create giant dragonflies which morph into an awkward, clunky, flying insectoid monster dubbed Megaguirus by some handy old male scientist whose only role in the film is to tell us this. Before the morphing, the dragonflies invade Tokyo, causing a devastating flood which inundates the Shibuya district. What causes the dragonflies to transform into the monster is never explained. G and MegaG eventually battle it out in Tokyo to great destructive effect.\n\nThe human cast is, thankfully, rather small and they keep to their assigned roles efficiently, in contrast to the overbearing busybodies in G2K who kept getting into G&apos;s face (sometimes literally!). Interestingly, the two female lead characters, one an officer (Misato Tanaka) devoted to neutralizing Godzilla, and the other an older scientist (Yuriko Hoshi) overseeing the Dimension Tide project, dominate the action with their resolute behavior and forceful personalities. The actresses are quite good and one wishes they&apos;d been given a little more to do with their characters (but not too much).\n\n While this film decidedly breaks no new ground, it does offer enough action and destruction to please the less discriminating Godzilla fans. Although its effects are not sophisticated enough for the jaded palates of today&apos;s JURASSIC PARK-weaned monster fans, the film&apos;s bursts of imagination might well surprise them."

And the Tibetans live in exile in India, so they have to deal with the Indian government, which is understandably nervous about irritating China.\n\nA fascinating look at the politics, geography, economics and demographics of three countries: Tibet, India and Denmark.

It starts normally, for a British setting, with the usual goofiness, but then everything changes when a group of three friends crash a party full of people in what appears to be a very strange cult. This is not the kind of movie I&apos;d like to watch often but as a one-off it is very entertaining for those of us who can appreciate the very unusual.\n\nMost of it takes place in the 1970s but there is a scene at the very end in 1992, apparently some new ones start to show up. In the credits is a statement, &quot;No aliens were harmed in making this film&quot; which gives a hint to what we just watched.\n\nIt has some of my favorite actors, including Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, and Ruth Wilson, all dressed strangely and playing very strange roles. It was a bit disconcerting to see Kidman and Wilson in such nontraditional roles."

First, the film at its original length seemed to go on forever. The elements were there, granted, but they didn&apos;t combine as they did in the previous film. I had the feeling of watching a film that was going through all the necessary steps but missing all the points. It was more an exercise in style which blindly followed all the guidelines but missed going anywhere. On the other hand, and perhaps unfairly to subsequent films, &quot;Caligari&quot; was a one-of-a-kinder that left no space for a sequel. Period.\n\nCurtis Stotlar",

      "reviewBody": "I confess that I have never read any of the Shadow pulps, although I do have a paperback reprint of the first story (I just haven&apos;t gotten around to reading it).  I&apos;ve never heard the radio show.  I have read the exquisite comic book series, by Denny O&apos;Neil and Mike Kaluta, from 1970&apos;s DC Comics. I loved those stories, with their noir elements, mood and atmosphere, and great characters.  When I heard a film was being made, I couldn&apos;t wait!  I bought a copy of the teaser poster, which hangs on my bedroom wall.  I read the novelization, which was quite good. Imagine my surprise when I saw the movie.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, I like the film, for the most part; but, it doesn&apos;t quite work.  It took a couple of viewings to figure out why.  For one, there isn&apos;t enough mystery here.  The Shadow was about mystery, as well as the fight against evil.  Two, the tone wasn&apos;t consistent.  It tries to be serious, but some parts are just too silly.  Three, some of the performances are uneven.  Tim Curry chews too much scenery and John Lone isn&apos;t wicked enough.  Four, the &quot;blood and thunder&quot; of the pulps is missing.  For a good cinematic example, see &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.  Finally, Russell Mulcahy is too uneven as a director.  I love Higlander, but outside of some of the music videos he directed, I don&apos;t care for much of his other work.\n\nAlec Balwin is fine as the title character, and Jonathan Winters was surprisingly good in a serious role.  Peter Boyle is great.  Ian McKellan is wasted and Tim Curry is too broad.  John Lone isn&apos;t broad enough.  Many of the other characters are forgettable.  Penelope Ann Miller isn&apos;t very convincing as the capable Margo Lane.\n\nIf I were to redo this film, I would have created more of a noir atmosphere, greater use of shadows and light.  I would of kept the Shadow&apos;s origin until at least the second act.  I would have kept an air of mystery surrounding the story and watch it slowly reveal itself.  I would have provided more &quot;blood and thunder&quot; in the key action scenes.  And I would have hired Mike Kaluta as the conceptual artist.\n\nStill, it beats George Pal&apos;s &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, but can&apos;t compare to the pulp thrills of &quot;The Mummy&quot; or the pulp/serial adventure of Indiana Jones.  It&apos;s certainly better than the old Kane Richmond and Rod Laroque movies.  Maybe someday a filmmaker will capture the spirit of the old pulp magazines, but please don&apos;t let it be something like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Doc Savage!"

It&apos;s unlikely story pairs a girl who dresses in rococo outfits with a tough biker chick (the supporting cast includes a man with a four-foot quiff); for those who aren&apos;t Japanese, it may come as a shock to learn, however, that the boutique rococo retailer that features in the film is actually a piece of product placement - it really exists, and there&apos;s some popularity to this bizarre style of dress. The film zips along, and there are some nice humorous touches, although it never feels deeper than a comic. But the tone is right for the material - and it&apos;s infinitely preferable to countless Hollywood comic adaptations that futilely try to tell us there&apos;s something profound in the their stories.",

      "reviewBody": "When this first came out 20 years ago I wasn&apos;t convinced Sting was as good as some (and he) would have us believe. After watching it, however, I had no doubts that this guy was a musical genius. Arrogant at times, but more often confident, he gambled his future on going solo, departing from perhaps the best rock group of its or any other time, the Police, and then rolled the dice again by allowing a film crew to capture the evolution of his new band from its inception. Shot on location primarily in and around Paris, the documentary-music-concert is full of revealing footage, showing the master at work as he directs his accomplished charges down a new path. The video is also filled, thanks to the wonderfully adroit editing of director Michael Apted, with light and spontaneous moments, banter and jockeying, as the musicians get to know themselves both as professionals and as people. In addition, candid and sometimes unpredictable interviews with Sting, the players, the band&apos;s manager, photographer, and others are strategically spliced into the body of the work. Fortunately free of the tantrums or heated exchanges so common in today&apos;s reality TV, this is nonetheless as authentic a portrait of music life behind the scenes as exists anywhere. The triumphant culmination is the concert where Sting unveils the band as well as his new material to an enthusiastic French audience. There are some surprises along the way, a questionable shot or two, but overall this is a real treat and one of its kind.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fear not the path of truth for the lack of people walking on it.&quot; June 6th, 1968 (From the last speech Bobby gave) At a time when through out the world we seem to have lost our way and our belief in our political leaders is perhaps at its lowest ebb. we see a reminder of what we had lost.\n\nThe sixties saw the assassination of John, Martin Malcolm and Bobby. As one of the actors says in the film &quot;Bobby  our last chance&quot;. We can only imagine what a different world we might have had had they lived.\n\nWhen it premiered at the Venice Film Festival (http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/ ) it received a seven minute standing ovation. The film&apos;s tagline is He saw wrong and tried to right it. He saw suffering and tried to heal it. He saw war and tried to stop it.\n\nThere are some icons of that time and one is the election poster of Robert F Kennedy from 1968 (http://www.rfkmemorial.org/ ).\n\nBobby is written and directed surprisingly by Emilio Estevez and features an amazing cast of stars. It is a fictional account of the lives of several people affected by and during the final hours of Senator Robert F Kennedy&apos;s life on the 6th of June 1968 as he attempted to become the Democratic candidate for President of the US. The film includes Anthony Hopkins playing the former doorman at the hotel where Kennedy was killed; other stars include Elijah Wood, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Christian Slater, Heleb Hunt, Harry Belafonte and my favourite TV President, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen).\n\n&quot;Our gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worth while. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.&quot; 1967 RFK For a generation it was Bobby who represented dashed hopes and dreams of a better world we might have had, which was cruelly taken away. At the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4th 1968, he left the ballroom after having won the all important California and South Dakota Primaries. He went through a service area to greet supporters working in the hotel&apos;s kitchen. While moving through a crowded kitchen passageway, Sirhan B Sirhan a 24-year-old Palestinian, fired a .22 calibre revolver directly into the crowd surrounding Kennedy. Kennedy, who was shot in the head at close range and also six other people were wounded. Although wounded he remained conscious for about 20 minutes where his concern was about others he was heard to say &quot;Is everybody all right?&quot; He was taken to Central Receiving Hospital and then Good Samaritan Hospital for emergency brain surgery. I was at school at the time in Melbourne in Derbyshire and the school put a room aside for any children to watch the news throughout the day to see if he survived lessons were put aside. He died there at the age of 42 in the early morning hours.\n\nWith his death the darkness seemed to descend having lost Martin Luther King already that year.\n\n&quot;A revolution is coming--a revolution which will be peaceful if we are wise enough; compassionate if we care enough; successful if we are fortunate enough--But a revolution which is coming whether we will it or not. We can affect its character; we cannot alter its inevitability.&quot; 1966 RFK He had just completed three and half years as one of the Senators for New York. He had helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty stricken Bedford Stuyvsant in New York City bringing business back into areas of New York they had left years before.\n\nHe had an ability to speak to people across divides in US society of the time which were strong. He managed to pull together a coalition of poor -- black and whites, middle class he spoke forcefully in favour of what he called the &quot;disaffected,&quot; the impoverished, and &quot;the excluded,&quot;.\n\nThe film gives a wondrful feeling as if you are really still living that hope.\n\n&quot;Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation ... It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest &quot; RFK It is my hope that this film will help to inspire a new generation for public service.",

The use of dialect is frequent but not in a way that would surprise you or add to the characters. The supporting cast consists of actually good actors or comedians but there lines are just not funny. I´m sorry to have wasted time on this movie. Btw the worst is still Roadflower (if you don´t know it do nothing about it)",

First there is the about 35 minutes long Sylvester celebration that could have been a short in itself; the combination of the ongoing music and the controlled pace of the image lets the atmosphere of the town and the tension brilliantly come across. Second sequence (already hinted at above) must also be the highlight of the film: the very moving final scene.\n\nThere is one minor dissonant: Selpin probably did not feel at ease with the &quot;love&apos;s interest&quot; within the story and this aspect is not very well done.",

The plots are different, but the moods seem to come from the same place. This movie gets it just right. It was obvious there would be a sad ending and I didn&apos;t mind. I didn&apos;t mind knowing it was coming either.\n\nNatalie Wood gets top billing in this movie, and she creates a convincing flirtatious southern belle. Robert Redford is more interesting in his role, however. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve seen him play cynical and laconic in any other role. Redford fans shouldn&apos;t miss this one.",

In both movies, a husband and wife retreat to a small town that turns out to be full of werewolves. I like this update, this is definitely a breath of fresh air to the series. Special effects weren&apos;t terrible and I loved the the different ideas of how people change into a werewolf. One melts into a puddle of goo in a gruesome scene when he is walking in the woods and drops to the ground and begins to literally melt and then comes back together as a werewolf. Well done scene Tom Savini worthy. There is another man that rips the skin off of his jaw and it grows and he turns into a werewolf. Alot of memorable scenes in this movie makes this a standout movie in the werewolf horror genre and is definitely one of the best movies out of the series."

      "reviewBody": "Raoul Walsh tackles Bret Harte in this one. It&apos;s a natural for this usually muscular director with a vicious sense of humor; he was fond of repeating Jack Pickford&apos;s comment that his idea of light comedy was to burn down a whorehouse.\n\nAlthough he has fallen out of favor, Harte and Mark Twain were judged neck-and-neck for the two best writers to come out of the Old West. Harte&apos;s characters were not one-dimensional; he approached them as complex human beings with conflicting sets of emotions and self-justifications. As a result, this movie, derived from &quot;Salomy Jane&apos;s Kiss&quot; has a lot going for it. Add in the outdoor shooting among the redwoods around Mount Shasta and the lovely conceit of using frame wipes that freeze the frame and then make it look like a page being turned, and you have a beautiful motion picture.\n\nUnhappily, few of the performances are up to the visuals. Perhaps it was due to the fact that handling of sound outdoors was still pretty primitive and some of the performers are either unseasoned for the screen or still not out of the silent era and the line readings sound very stagey. Whatever the reasons, they act best when they are doing things, not saying things -- the hanging sequence is devastating.\n\nEven with that cavil, this is a wonderful picture. Everyone looks right and Joan Bennett is stunningly beautiful. If you get a chance to see it -- mine came with the 2012 Museum of Modern Art &apos;To Preserve and Project&apos; festival -- take it.",

Helping Byeong-gu is his girlfriend Su-ni (played by Jeong-min Hwang).\n\nThe characters in the movie are really deep, with lots of characteristics, and they are so very well portrayed on the screen, which makes it so easy to submerge yourself into the storyline and the universe portrayed in the movie. And hats off to Ha-kyun Shin for his portrayal of Byeong-gu, he was just amazing.\n\n&quot;Save the Green Planet!&quot; surprised me with the torture scenes that were in it. I hadn&apos;t expected anything like that from the movie. But it worked very well, especially because it was very crucial to the storyline. It is quite graphical at times, so be warned.\n\nIf you enjoy Korean movies, then you definitely have to watch &quot;Save the Green Planet!&quot;, because it is well worth the time and effort. This movie is a rather amazing surprise.",

However, my three granddaughters 16, 13 and 10 insisted they wanted to see it on the recommendation from some friends. I am happy they did. It was much better than the professional reviews led me to believe. I would recommend that any parent or grandparent, as in my case, take take their kids to see this movie.\n\nI will say this about the expert reviews, they helped give us excellent seats. Sometimes I wonder if they have lost touch with what movie goers want to see. They have gotten to wrapped up in the technique of the art to be able to recognize a good movie. Maybe the courses on movie making should modify their guidelines to include what the general public considers a good movie.",

The film follows Menjou&apos;s attempts to throw everyone out of the hotel and Murphy&apos;s attempts to get some backing for his show.\n\nThe film is easy to watch with pleasant songs and some funny moments. Gloria DeHaven (Chris) and Frank Sinatra (Glenn) are good but Murphy and Menjou are guilty of shouting too much, The story is complete nonsense and overall it&apos;s too shouty.\n\nSinatra can obviously sing but it is the female backing singers that leave a lasting impression. They sing in that Wonderful World of Disney style that leaves a magical note in the air.",

In the middle, playing off all sides, is Rosalba Neri&apos;s character Margaret. She gets to wear a couple of nice dresses and look pretty great, and while the role is hardly taxing, it&apos;s all good fun for Neri watchers. She&apos;s out for herself and wants the gold anyway she can get it. It&apos;s a decent role and she manages to stay alive past the 30 minutes mark. Fernando Sancho is second billed but has few scenes. Some of the fight scenes ( as well as Jim&apos;s one liners ) have comic sound effects added The is minimal violence and no blood during shootouts. The full screen video I saw looked like 16 mm and had muffled audio, and was brutally cropped and panned and scanned. Not ideal in the A/V dept.but could have been worse, and 2.35 widescreen remastered DVD would be a far nicer way to evaluate this one. Rosalba&apos;s star would far brighter the same year in JOHNNY YUMA, but this is also well worth a look for fans of the Euro goddess Neri",

Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south."

      "reviewBody": "Joe D&apos;Amato&apos;s 1980 erotic drama Orgasmo nero (literally, &quot;Black Orgasm&quot;) takes us on a journey to a Caribbean island, where passion, desire, and unrestrained sexuality await.\n\nPaul (Richard Harrison) is a researcher on a Caribbean island who is joined by his wife, Helen (Nieves Navarro). Helen, sexually frustrated, soon forms an intimate bond with a native girl, Haini (Lucia Ramirez), and their relationship quickly becomes sexual. Helen even brings Haini back to her home, setting off a chain of dramatic and titillating events.\n\nOrgasmo nero is a classic example of D&apos;Amato&apos;s unique style, blending sex and horror, though this entry leans more heavily into the former. It is known for its explicit sexual content, including both heterosexual and lesbian encounters, earning its place in the canon of sexploitation cinema.\n\nThe film delivers on its promise of eroticism, with D&apos;Amato crafting a narrative that holds attention and stimulates the senses. However, it falls into some of the same traps as other D&apos;Amato films, with a runtime that feels excessive and pacing that drags in certain parts.\n\nOne of the most memorable aspects of Orgasmo nero is its setting. The Caribbean island provides a lush and exotic backdrop, adding to the sense of liberation and hedonism that permeates the film. The use of location also contributes to the sense of &quot;other-ness&quot; that enhances the film&apos;s themes of sexual exploration and transgression.\n\nThe performances in Orgasmo nero are serviceable, with Navarro and Ramirez embracing their roles and delivering the necessary chemistry to sell the erotic storyline. Keep an eye out for a particularly steamy scene between them, where a naked Navarro, with her hairy vagina on full display, passionately locks lips with Ramirez, their bodies entwined in a sensual embrace. It&apos;s a moment that encapsulates the film&apos;s unapologetic celebration of female desire and pleasure.\n\nHowever, despite its strengths, Orgasmo nero fails to reach the heights of infamy achieved by some of D&apos;Amato&apos;s other works, such as Porno Holocaust and Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. While it delivers on the sexual content, the horror elements are largely absent, aside from brief appearances in the opening and closing scenes.\n\nIn conclusion, Orgasmo nero is a film that will appeal to fans of D&apos;Amato&apos;s unique brand of sleaze and eroticism. While it may not revolutionize the genre, it provides a stimulating viewing experience.",

      "name": "Moving and dramatic  Spaghetti about a violent feud among two families",
      "reviewBody": "Spanish-Italian co-production with Spaghett-hero as Peter Lee Lawrence as Johnny Kidd against Campos family . An Italian-Spanish co-production full of action , exaggerated characters, gun-play and lots of violence . California, two families , the Mounter (Montescos , formed by Luis Induni , Ana Maria Noe and Peter Lee) and the Campos (Capuletos, formed by Peter Martell, Jose Rubio and Rufino Ingles) live in eternal facing off. In the beginning of the movie there is a confrontation but the Mounter are double-crossed and takes place an ambush . The sole survivor named Kidd (Peter Lee Lawrence), of a slaughter seeks vendetta . After suffering atrocity , Kid executes a single-handedly revenge , he hits , ravage and kills each person involved in the massacre . For pleasure, for avenge, he doesn&apos;t care why he kills or how . He is relentless in his vendetta , deadly in his violence . The conflict is simple one between avenger Kid and a Baron land with his hoodlums ,oppressors, nasty bandits . Johnny learns the shooting of Lefty (a Mercurio role-alike). Meanwhile Kidd along with his pal (Andres Mejuto) who holds a hook attack a stagecoach and falls in love with Giuletta (Cristina Galbo). Johnny looks for vengeance , taking on Diego (Peter Martell or Prieto Martellanz in a Tybaldo character-alike) . Later on , Kidd is submitted a tempestuous trap and is caught .\n\nIt&apos;s an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Peter Lee Lawrence and the enemy ,the Campos family, and his underlings. Peter Lee is fine, he ravages the screen, he jumps, shoots , hit and run and ultimately takes the law on his own hands, but also receives violent punches . The protagonists , Lee and Galbo , married in real life until early death Peter Lawrence who committed suicide at 29 years old .Peter Martell as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . Nice acting by Andres Mejuto as two-fisted bounty-hunter gunfighter with a hook . Furthermore, appears usual secondary actors from Italian/Spanish Western as Luis Induni , Maria Cuadra ,Rufino Ingles , Piero Lulli and several others. Brief appearance of future terror myth , Paul Naschy , uncredited and almost extra . The film blends violence, blood, tension, high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes . This is an average Spaghetti Western with some moments genuinely entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much. Follows the exploits of Kidd in SW usual theme, the revenge , in addition the starring attempts to reunite his lover facing rivalry among families . Mediocre performances seem badly dated today .The musician Gino Peguri composes a vibrant soundtrack in Morricone style and well conducted ; including a catching leitmotif . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors, dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with striking cinematography in Eastmancolor with negative well processed . Interior filmed in Roma Studios (Madrid), Cinecitta Studios (Rome) and outdoor sequences filmed at Colmenar Viejo , Manzanares del Real , Aranjuez, and La Pedriza , location along with Almeria, where in the 60s and 70s were shot innumerable Spaghetti.\n\nIt&apos;s a Western freely based on famous novel by Shakespeare titled ¨Romeo and Giuletta . Other Spaghetti based on known and classic novels , are the following : ¨Johnny Hamlet¨(1968) by Enzo G Castellari ; ¨The return of Ringo¨ by Duccio Tessari inspired on the ¨Odyssey¨, ¨John Il Bastardo¨(1967) based on books from Zorrilla and Moliere ; and ¨Anche Nel West Céra una Volta Dio ¨ (1968)by Marino Girolami¨based on ¨Island of treasure¨ by Robert Stevenson. The motion picture is middlingly directed by Gianni Puccini in his last film , he was a craftsman who directed all kind genres and wrote classic Italians as ¨Bitter rice¨ and ¨Ossessione¨ until his early death at 50 years old . Rating: 5,5 ; regular but entertaining.",

But for those of you that don&apos;t, you read the reviews and see if it&apos;s worth a rental with a bunch of smaller-scale actors. For this one, it is.\n\nNick Chinlund (the guy Nic Cage said &quot;Give me the bunny&quot; to in Con Air) wakes up in a hospital in a foreign land. He can&apos;t remember who he is, how he got there, or what he was doing beforehand. It sounds pretty typical, I know.\n\nThe acting is exceptional, which is not a surprise with Chinlund. He never disappoints. I&apos;ll never forget the killer he played in &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Isaach de Bankole is the guy who starred in &quot;The Limits of Control&quot;, and he here plays an investigator of sorts, who is trying to figure out Chinlund&apos;s story. Henry Czerny and Peter Bogdanovich also have small roles.\n\nI watched this on netflix instant play, and I&apos;m glad I did, though &quot;The Fifth Patient&quot; really brings nothing new to the table. It was a good film with good actors, but it&apos;s not a film I&apos;d go all-out to see.",

      "reviewBody": "Homosexual playboy in 1930s Germany fights to keep himself and his gay flat-mate out of the grasp of Nazi soldiers, but they are soon rounded up and face the horrors of war. This tough-going drama doesn&apos;t delve too deeply into the Party&apos;s initial conflict over homosexuality, but it does touch on the labeling of gay men with the Pink Triangle, making them perhaps even more reviled than the Jews (Clive Owen picks the yellow Star of David symbol over the triangle, figuring being a Jew might actually help him survive). Initially arty presentation has flashes of pretension, but is still gripping on a visual and visceral level and very well-acted. It&apos;s almost two different movies, however, with a work-camp second-half given an appropriately straightforward, if unexciting, treatment. Adapted from the controversial play, the last act has perhaps more going on than is actually revealed, and the viewer may either feel the movie loses its energy and soul during this portion or that it is successful on an entirely different level. In any case, difficult as an entertainment, but certainly worthwhile for those curious about this lost chapter in history. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "This is a combination/remake of episodes 1, Voyagers + 15 Voyagers of the Titanic. The negative reviews are really VERY uncalled for so I had to give this to even up the score at 2+ &amp; 2-. I grant that the special effects aren&apos;t fantastic, but that misses the point. If you stand back and look at the big picture, as with most action adventure sci fi this is about RELATIONSHIP, and considering this is Jon-Eric&apos;s first starring role, it&apos;s really good for those with eyes to see, unlike the bad reviewers. It&apos;s absurd how just like blind brainwashed people talk about folk being &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; when scientifically everyone is really different shades of melanin brown, so too, the sickos that say this is NAMBLA territory are also useful idiots for perverts. Those who aren&apos;t mindless tools know this is the wonderful gift specifically of Phineas being the dad Jeffrey never had and generally of him being a hero saving history, though I do think it would have come off better if it had been less camp/silly and more serious, but most audiences are sadly too childish for that. What&apos;s particularly irritating about these negative reviews is their at least potentially fatal interference with what might have been an attempt at reviving the series, which would be a wonderful idea, though pretty hard to follow in Jon-Eric&apos;s heroic footsteps, though I&apos;d love to see Star Gate Atlantis&apos;s Joe Flanigan take that lead. Don&apos;t let the inappropriately negative reviews fool you into missing out on this. They have a right to their opinion but that doesn&apos;t make them authoritative and I can guarantee many disagree.",

What a beautiful woman Antonelli, such grace, those eyes, that body, that voice. Those who believe that she was just a sex symbol, they are wrong, she was first an exceptional actress. Especially in Visconti&apos;s film, L&apos;Innocent (1976) and The Divine Nymph (1975), directed by Giuseppe Patroni Griffi. This Hypochondriac (1979) (Il malato immaginario original title), confirms again, Laura makes an excellent role. Along with probably the greatest entertainer of all time, the great, the unique Alberto Sordi. They are joined by several more great names of cinema: Bernard Blier, Marina Vlady, Vittorio Caprioli, Giuliana de Sio. Beautiful music by Piero Piccioni and great cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi.",

But I found the same apocalyptic tension in Havana as in Casablanca, although not quite as effective the second time around. Others criticized the dialogue. I thought it was exceptionally mature, and subtle, which may be what threw some of the reviewers in this forum, who maybe would have wanted something more bombastic. The plot development was very compressed - things had to happen very quickly, and so some thought they happened far too quickly. But I thought Olin in particular showed all of the pain and turmoil necessary to make her quick transitions of emotion believable. You have to believe that the times were so tumultuous that people had to adjust very quickly to changing circumstances. As for Jack falling in love with Bobby so fast, that&apos;s entirely believable, and  the look they exchanged at the party where Jack meets her husband for the first time was our signal that this love affair was happening, and was one of those insane passions that overtake people, not infrequently, and in this case, again, against the apocalyptic backdrop of this incipient revolution, which made all involved feel very much at loose ends, ready for, or dreading, the vast changes about to happen to them. I though the end was too dragged out, but other than that, the movie mostly plausible."

      "reviewBody": "This charming comedy is justly famous as the film that made the whole world fall in love with Audrey Hepburn and half the world want to run out and buy a Vespa scooter. Hepburn was always beguiling, but in some of her later roles she tended to overplay the winsomeness. Here every note she hits is just about perfect.\n\nAnd speaking of notes, pay special attention to the score by the great Georges Auric. If the film had been produced in the manner of modern romantic comedies, the sound track would have been larded with pop hits by Perry Como, Dinah Shore, and Frankie Laine, which would have done an awful lot to destroy the magic. Instead Auric&apos;s complex, vibrant, evocative music complements the story&apos;s inherent lyricism without upstaging it. In an era of bombastic film scoring, this seems a miracle.\n\nSomeone once said that Audrey Hepburn&apos;s was the beauty of possibility and transformation -- she was always in motion, always becoming something else. &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; is very much of a piece with that notion. On the surface, the film is about a princess who disguises herself as a &quot;commoner&quot;. But in truth she&apos;s actually pretending to be a princess, at least at first. She finally becomes authentic -- is transformed and prepared to deal with her destiny -- only through the ennobling power of love and sacrifice. That&apos;s one heck of a mythic subtext and does a lot to explain &quot;Roman Holiday&apos;s&quot; enduring power."

      "reviewBody": "Agreed, pretentious drivel, dull and impossible to care about! To me there were many, many problems with this film - the voiceover is very self-consciously attempting to be poetic but fails, most of the music is very irritating, loutish music for yobs not very popular even when originally released. The acting , Kevin McKidd&apos;s portrayal of Frankie is remarkably wooden for an actor that once showed such promise, how far he has fallen in such a short period of time. I suppose he suffered from poor direction, often the problem with a new and inexperienced director and producer afraid to keep his feet on the ground, pretentious aspirations have run riot, an attempt to make a &quot;worthy&quot; film, has unfortunately steered this ship on to the rocks of self indulgence. Agreed the story may be personal and minimal but in my opinion who should or could care about such ugly, cruel youths or their fates. I found my self almost immediately emotionally detached from all the characters though bored indifference. Comparisons to &apos;Ratcatcher&apos; are truly laughable. Another film by a native of Edinburgh that made the Edinburgh Festival (historically automatic for any film ever made in Edinburgh) that also suffers from  being shot on high definition for £450,000, for goodness sake with that amount of money the film could have easily been shot on superior 35mm film which would have made the film look much better rather than the &apos;Dogma&apos; video looking quality print that I saw in Edinburgh, why do people working on tape always say that it looks so much like 35mm film, when to shoot on film would mean it would automatically look like film instead of automatically demoting the film to DVD/ Video sell through, because when projected the majority of cinema goers including myself hate paying to see washed out grainy, poor quality blown up video images. The direction will not move you I guarantee and as for the production values...who goes to see, rents or buys films for their production values? At the end of the day you pay your money to be entertained or moved and you will fail to receive either from this debut, sadly this film is pretentious drivel, the critics will slaughter it and the investors will loose their shirts, harsh but an economic truth. Yet another British embarrassment on its way to festivals guaranteed to be laughed at, with jaws dropped open in shock, by our American cousins."

      "reviewBody": "Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck star in &quot;To Please a Lady,&quot; a 1950 film directed by Clarence Brown. Adolphe Menjou also stars.\n\nIt took Gable&apos;s career a while to get back on track - excuse the pun - after World War II. He was older than the other matinée idols, he was a grieving widower when he returned from the war, and the indelible image he had created as Rhett Butler would haunt him. It wasn&apos;t until the mid-fifties that he really found his groove with some very good films.\n\nThis is one of the ordinary type films Gable made during this period, and here he&apos;s joined by Barbara Stanwyck as a sharp columnist. She is critical of midget car racer Gable when, during a race, another driver is killed, and he was part of the collision. She basically destroys his career in midget car racing. After some stunt driving, he earns enough to buy a car to enter the big car races. Feeling at first guilty about hurting his career, Stanwyck seeks him out while he&apos;s stunt driving; they fall for one another, but she can&apos;t get past his ruthlessness in competition.\n\nBoth stars are very good. Stanwyck did these cold businesswomen well. She&apos;s moving here into older women roles, her wonderful figure intact.\n\nThere is a lot of speedway racing in this film.\n\nThis movie is pleasant enough, but it would have been nice if stars of this stature could have been given a really top-notch script and production values.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow. Another clunker from Canadian &quot;auteur&quot; Andrew Van Slee. At least this one is somewhat watchable, unlike his earlier epic &quot;Totally Blonde.&quot;\n\nThe scariest thing about this entire movie is the teeth of the actors. Instead of rehearsing, the director must have thrown a teeth-whitening party. Almost every character has teeth that look like chiclets which had been soaking in bleach for a week. \n\nThe plot line follows that of &quot;Fiday the 13th&quot; -- the only difference, and it&apos;s huge, is that instead of watching the kids die one by one in imaginative efx sequences, all of the violence takes place off-camera. A shadowy murderer appears, the victim reacts, and we see the bloody aftermath. The entire efx budget seems to have been spent on a bucket of fake blood and a number 4 paint brush. \n\nMost of the actors are good, but a few are grade A hambones. The characters are entirely generic. In fact, none of the human characters are as interesting as the farm tools used by the killer. And we don&apos;t get to see those farm tools act... just the aftermath.\n\nThe dialog is atrocious. The opening character set-up is a long, labored discourse which makes it clear to anyone who didn&apos;t already know that teenage boys like sex. They also call each other &quot;dude&quot; a lot. It seems dated, but hey, maybe Canada&apos;s teens are on some kind of culture curve. Another ten years and they&apos;ll be getting into hiphop. \n\nThere&apos;s a big surprise ending which I won&apos;t reveal. Anyone who makes it through this piece of dreck, even on fast-forward, deserves the miniscule thrill of the revelation.\n\nThe ending sets up a sequel, apparently intending to rip off &quot;Halloween&quot; in the next installment, since they blatantly ripped off the theme music to set it up.\n\nIf you&apos;re tempted by the premise, skip this turkey and rent the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; instead. Even if you&apos;ve seen it fifty times it&apos;ll still be more exciting.",

      "reviewBody": "Poor Shirley MacLaine. I have seen her in other movies (just today &quot;Guarding Tess) so I know she can be good, but judging by her acting in this film one would think she is a bad actress. Here she plays another in a long line of eccentric characters. The problem is she is no longer in her 20s and can be cute and kooky as in &quot;The Apartment&quot;, &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;.\n\nJudging from the entire movie, the movie script fails her as the script is terrible. However Ms. MacLaine has been in the movie business since 1955 and has appeared in a number of excellent movies so she at least could have made her role good in this bad movie. Nope. Not in this movie. Take for instance the scene where she talks to the screen in the movie theater and then harangues the young usher who comes to ask her to be quiet. Dreadful performance in a dreadful scene. It is also an unnecessary scene as we already know MacLaine&apos;s character is embarrassing to her granddaughters.\n\nJulia Stiles again plays a young uptight woman who needs to learn to loosen up. Ms. Stiles has acted since 1994, many years prior to this 2003 movie. She has experience playing this role before, i.e. in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; from 1999. Stiles also could have brought something interesting to her role here. She didn&apos;t.\n\nThe characters in this movie were all eccentric characters who were one dimensional and annoying, and not real at all.\n\nStiles played an uptight woman who never had more than three dates with one person. Her best friend is man (she has no women friends) who lives near her apartment. He writes romance novels under a fake name, has a crush on her, and she has no idea. Duh. As the best male friend in movies is often stereotypically a gay man, I initially thought he was gay. When he hired the gay housecleaning duo to clean her apartment, I was sure he was gay. Speaking of the gay house cleaners, talk about an offensive stereotype.\n\nAnyway, her best friend is not gay, and although he claims to understand her well and can predict she will act a certain way - and tells her so, when she does act the way he knew she would, he gets upset. Huh? All a plot device to have &quot;boy lose girl&quot;.\n\nI don&apos;t think Stiles, MacLaine, or most any of the actors, cared for this movie. They must have been in it either because of an obligation or they needed the money.\n\nWatching this movie is a waste of time, and I bet the actors wish they hadn&apos;t wasted their time making this movie."

In this brief doc Wyler not only captures some of the most harrowing air combat footage in history but also gives us an outstanding overview of what it takes to mount a bombing raid, recognizing the importance of all involved, the shared bond of a diverse group.\n\nSome of the outstanding camerawork in the tight confines of the fortress puts you in the waist gunner position with a Messerschmitt, guns blazing roars at you while ominous flak explodes around &quot;Belle&quot; the chaos verbalized over headsets.\n\nWell edited in displaying the might of the Allies and the stoic resolve and everyday courage of its military &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; is more than just propaganda and an outstanding document of WW2 but a gripping suspense with a lot more on the line than a fiction.",

But the lead pair could have done better. \n\nOne thing that is horrible about the movie is the ending. One of the most horrible endings there could have been, the director tries to be unconventional but fails miserably. MISERABLY. If only the scene went differently I would actually be recommending this movie to those tired of old stuff.",

The themes, however, are similar and that&apos;s where the success lies.\n\nI didn&apos;t want a Red Ryder BB gun when I was that age but my Christmas wish was just as fervent and I schemed just as hard as Ralphie.

      "name": "A more primitive but sexier version of the Dashiell Hammett novel",
      "reviewBody": "Roy Del Ruth directed the original adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel in 1931, which starred Ricardo Cortez. \n\nIn a nutshell, THE MALTESE FALCON told the story about a San Francisco private detective named Sam Spade, who finds himself drawn into a search for a valuable falcon statuette first created during the Crusades, while investigating three murders.\n\nThe story began with a Miss Ruth Wonderly hiring Spade and his partner, Miles Archer, to find her missing sister and a man named Floyd Thursby. When Thursby and Archer end up murdered, Spade discovered that Miss Wonderly is one of three people searching for a statuette called the Maltese Falcon. A mortally wounded ship&apos;s captain delivered the statuette to Spade&apos;s office before dropping dead, making him the case&apos;s third murder victim. The entire case spiraled into a game of cat-and-mouse between Spade, Miss Wonderly, a wealthy fat Englishman named Caspar Gutman and an effeminate continental European named Dr. Joel Cairo. Spade also had to deal with the police, who are determined to pin the three deaths on him. \n\nIn the end, this version turned out better than I had expected. However, the movie is not without its faults. There were times when I felt I was watching a filmed play (very common with early talking movies). But the film&apos;s main problem seemed to be its pacing. It seemed too slow for what was supposed to be a witty murder mystery. Especially during the first half hour. By the time Joel Cairo was introduced into the story, the pacing finally began to pick up. The dialogue provided by screenwriters Maude Fulton, Brown Holmes and an unaccredited Lucien Hubbard failed to improve over the course of the movie. Not only did the screenplay allow the dialogue to drag throughout the entire film, the latter was not that memorable.\n\nConsidering that this is the only precode version of the film, it is not surprising that this version is considered the sexiest of the three filmed versions of the novel. Del Ruth, along with Fulton, Holmes and Hubbard, did an excellent job of conveying the womanizing aspect of Spade&apos;s character by revealing his affairs with Archer&apos;s wife Iva, his casual flirtation with his secretary Effie, and visual hints of his relationship with Ruth Wonderly like a small indent in the pillow next to the client&apos;s head, which hinted that Spade had spent the night with her. Other signs of precode sexuality included Spade bidding a female client good-bye at the beginning of the movie, a nude Miss Wonderly in a bathtub, and a hint of a homosexual relationship between Caspar Gutman and his young enforcer Wilmer Cook.\n\nThis version lacked the sharp wit of the 1941 adaptation. Considering that I have never read the novel, the screenplay did allow me to completely understand the story in full detail for the first time, without leaving me in a slight haze of fog. I found nothing memorable about William Rees&apos; photography or Robert M. Haas&apos; art direction except in one scene. The scene in question featured an exterior setting, namely a street in San Francisco&apos;s Chinatown where Miles Archer&apos;s body was discovered. I suspect that this particular scene gave both Rees and Haas an opportunity to display their artistry beyond the movie&apos;s usual interior settings.\n\nThere is also a solid cast here. Ricardo Cortez, led the cast as detective Sam Spade. Cortez gave a very sexy interpretation of Spade in his performance. His constant smirks and grins in the film&apos;s first ten to fifteen minutes seemed annoying. But in the end, Cortez grew on me. I can honestly say that not only did I find him very effective in portraying a sexy Sam Spade, he also managed to superbly capture the character&apos;s cynical humor, toughness and deep contempt toward the police.\n\nBebe Daniels, another survivor from the silent era, portrayed Ruth Wonderly, and this role has to be considered as one of her best. She managed to give an excellent performance as the ladylike yet manipulative woman who drew Spade into the labyrinth search for the Maltese Falcon. Mind you, she lacked Mary Astor&apos;s throbbing voice and nervous manner. But that is merely a minor hitch. Daniels still managed to portray a very convincing elegant temptress. \n\nIrish-born Dudley Digges portrayed the wealthy and obsessive Caspar Gutman, who is not above murder, bribery and a score of other crimes to acquire the falcon statuette. Digges lacked the style to believably portray a man wealthy enough to conduct a twenty-year search for a valuable artifact. Instead, Digges reminded me of a corrupt minor official at a British post in the tropics. He seemed to lack talent and subtlety for infusing menace into his character. Whenever he tried to menacing, he only ended up giving a hammy performance. On the other hand, Otto Matieson gave a more believable performance as Dr. Joel Cairo, Gutman&apos;s Continental accomplice. Matieson portrayed Cairo as a no-nonsense and practical man who is careful with his money and with whom to trust it.\n\nUna Merkel gave a humorous performance as Spade&apos;s Girl Friday, Effie. Her Effie is not hesitant about expressing her attraction to Spade, yet at the same time, she seemed to find the detective&apos;s other amorous activities rather amusing. Todd seemed to be trying too hard as a scorned lover without any subtlety. At least Dwight Frye fared better as Gutman&apos;s young enforcer, Wilmer Cook. He did a solid job in conveying the portrait of a baby-faced killer.\n\nI&apos;d suggest watching the 1931 version and the 1941 versions back to back, to get an idea of how Warner Brothers &quot;grew up&quot; during the 1930s. Remember they were just a poverty row studio mainly known for their Rin Tin Tin silent until The Jazz Singer made them rich.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a little gem in British film-making. It is beautifully shot in south Wales, with a gorgeous score, and top performances, particularly Ian Bannen as the gifted healer who befriends John-Paul Macleod. What I liked about it though, was that some of the characters are allowed to pursue their spiritual sides - in the old-fashioned Christian sense of the word spiritual, without any sense of mocking from the film-makers. That&apos;s rare. Christian attitudes tend to be looked down on in todays movies.\n\nBut even if you really don&apos;t care for that aspect of the story, it&apos;s well worth watching for all the reasons I mentioned above. All the actors are brilliant, and the film kind of reels you in to make you watch it - I was just flicking through the channels, and there it was, and I really couldn&apos;t stop watching it! So I missed the first five minutes...!\n\nWatch it if you are interested in quality films that make you think, and care about the characters, and leave you feeling nice and warm, rather than cold."

These shorts were made in rapid succession and while some are great, some are ok (like this one) and some are bad. Despite the results they were all released in theaters. These early shorts are pretty much like home videos (like the ones played on AMERICA&apos;S FUNNIEST VIDEOS) with people that do stupid things and in the end they have pratfalls. His tramp character (that debuted here) was still evolving as he switched to Essenay studios a year later. He stopped this evolution process with his full-length movies in the 1920s.\n\nIn this short, as I said in the summary, there isn&apos;t much plot. The Keystone crew went on a kid auto race and they told Chaplin to just wander around and coming in and out of the track. The only thing that happens beside this is that he is sometimes punched by few adults for getting in the track. The only thing for which this short is important is because we have a first shot of Chaplin&apos;s most famous character.",

The boy eventually leaves to make his own way and loses touch with the (foster) sister and father. The three of them run into more than their share of misfortunes and hardships, and travel independently across the breadth of Korea, every few years they meet briefly. Pansori didn&apos;t appear to be the way to riches. Lots of the periodic singing and grand scenery, floating cherry blossoms, mountains, wind-blown grasses, artistic trees, some real nice photography here. The music and singing are very emotional. A lamentation for better times past, this movie is a good portrayal of the Korean psyche.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;One hundred years have come and gone since 1849&quot;intone the Sons of the Pioneers over the titles of the movie ,thus establishing what we are about to see is a reminiscence of the days when the West was opened up.The movie is ballad heavy indeed,and could be seen as the movie that most precisely mirrors Ford&apos;s love of music,which is shown as a unifying force bringing communities together .Ford was to claim it was his favourite movie-one which,together with &quot;The Fugitive&quot;and &quot;The Sun Shines Bright&quot;saw him most accurately achieve what he set out to do It is an intimate epic whose episodic narrative focuses on the exploits of a Mormon wagon train leaving the inhospitable climes of the city to seek out the &quot;promised land&quot;near the San Juan River.They are guided by two horse traders,played by those dependable Ford repertory company members Ben Johnson and Harry Carry Jnr .Indians are encountered but ,uniquely for a wagon train movie they are friendly and there is no grand scale Indian attack.Instead the chief menace comes from an outlaw gang headed by the truly evil Uncle Silas(a mesmerising performance by Charles Kempson)and featuring rare unsympathetic roles from James Arness and Hank Worden.It is they who bring trouble on the train and menace its inhabitants.\n\nThe casting is perfect.Ford normally relied on iconographic peformers like Wayne ,Fonda or Stewart but by casting Johnson and Carry he chose the &quot;right size&quot;actors &apos;ones who are more able to suggest the decent ordinary men who will lay it on the line for the right cause and can persuade an audience they just might lose Good to see Alan Mowbray as an itinerant showman reprising the type of role he played so memorably in My Darling Clementine and Ward Bond as the worldly Mormon leader is fine.Only two problems for me with the movie-love interest in the form of Joanna Dru did not convince and I could not believe Mormons were as liberal as depicted here.Minor quibbles apart it is a beautiful movie with atmospheric monochrome photography and a love for the material and the era it celebrates shining through.Elsewhere on this site-its Message boards to be exact-Ford detractors have started their pettifogging sniping.I would like to think this movie would silence their iconoclastic jejeune ravings but probably not. Enjoy and wallow in its visual and emotional beauty"

      "reviewBody": "From the very capable hands of Danish directing-legends Lau Lauritzen and Alice O&apos;Fredericks comes an entertaining crime-story, about four office clerks with a knack for motorcycling and throwing wild parties, who by chance gets involved in a blackmailing case, where one of their girlfriend acquaintances is threatened by a band of scoundrels, who tries to force her to give them all of her husband&apos;s values, in return for some compromising letters from her shady past. \n\nThe three &quot;old&quot; clerks, Nielsen (Reichardt), Jensen (Gundmann) and Bøjesen (Borge) and their new friend Birk (Lauritzen) then gets on the case, and quickly travels to Stockholm, where they exchange fisticuffs with some of the baddies, and then travel back to Denmark for some more rowdiness and crazy antics - all whilst Victor Borge (aka Børge Rosenbaum) plays the piano and displays the same type of humor he later became world-famous for.\n\nAlong the way, we get a handful of great old tunes, sung wonderfully by the cast, and also a lot of exciting motorcycle-stunts and interesting shots of the scenery back then, before the war broke out.\n\nAs a little piece of trivia-information, this was actually Victor Borge&apos;s last movie in his native Denmark, as he was forced to emigrate to the States after WWII broke out (because of his Jewish heritage). Henry Gleditsch, the actor who played the director, did not leave his native Norway, and was captured and shot to death by the Nazis in 1942. \n\nThis movie is out on an excellent DVD in Denmark, so if you can find it, I highly recommend it. 9/10",

It&apos;s pretty much this film except they&apos;re filming for a show called Grave Encounters. They explore an haunted asylum and capture the footage of ghost activity. Except things go wrong for the worse cause the ghost will never let them leave. I enjoyed the film but there are problems with it. My opinion: when people die, I couldn&apos;t tell if they died because the deaths happened off screen and there&apos;s barely blood around. And it just seemed rushed and things are slow as well. And the ending was just...What? But I did enjoy the film and it was a solid concept",

      "reviewBody": "A fully uniformed Egyptian police band arrives in Israel to perform at the opening ceremony of a new Arab Cultural Center but no one shows up to meet them at the airport. Lonely and tired, they end up taking the wrong bus, ending up in Bet Hatikvah, a lonely outpost in the Negev that, according to one of its residents, not only doesn&apos;t have a cultural center but has no culture. Unable to get transportation until the next morning, the band agrees to stay overnight at a local restaurant run by Dina (Ronit Elkabetz), a free-spirited but lonely Israeli restaurateur who longs for companionship.\n\nEran Kolirin&apos;s A Band&apos;s Visit is the story of the small connections that bring people together. Israeli&apos;s submission as Best Foreign Film at the Oscars (rejected because much of its dialog is in English), it is about what some of us have lost in modern society  the ability to reach across cultural, political, and language barriers to connect with fellow human beings. Over the course of the evening, the Israelis and the Egyptians approach each other tentatively and little by little, the staid Egyptians open up to their Israeli hosts, finding some common ground exemplified in a spontaneous dinner table rendition of George Gershwin&apos;s &quot;Summertime&quot;.\n\nWhen the two groups begin to get to know each other, they find that beneath the language and cultural differences, they are simply people - full of joy and sadness, friendship and loneliness, connection and loss. Tewfiq (Sasson Gabal), the conductor of the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra, is formal and rigid in his demeanor but is able to strike up a friendship with Dina (Ronit Elkabetz). After some awkward silences, the melancholy conductor reveals details of tragic losses in his family and how he feels that he is to blame. Another band member, Khaled (Saleh Bakri) decides to accompany local Papi (Shlomi Avraham) and his date to a roller skating rink. In a memorable scene, Khaled offers the socially backward Papi some instructions on courting his shy girl friend.\n\nIn another moving sequence, band member Simon (Kalifa Natour) plays a lovely but unfinished composition for the clarinet for Itzik (Rubi Moscovich) who tells him that he should end the piece, not with a traditional showy display but with what is there for him at the moment, &quot;not sad, not happy, a small room, a lamp, a bed, a child sleeping, and tons of loneliness.&quot; A Band&apos;s Visit is a film about Israeli&apos;s and Arabs but without the usual backdrop of boundary disputes, the peace process, or the religious divide, even avoiding the clichés about how music is a universal language. It is a small film but wise in its understated depiction of humanity&apos;s common bonds, slow-paced but held together with a sensitive charm.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes you watch films for others, and this was one of them. I thought it might lighten darker days, but it had the effect of making me very depressed. Not about its content but about why it was made at all. Deborah Kerr in her most true blue way was terrible to watch, filled with empty mannerisms and surrounded by greed and wealth. She could be a good actress and a mediocre one, and this performance was truly bad. She marries a very rich Frenchman played by Rossano Brazzi ( the Italian accent made this nonsense ) and they have a young son who should never have been let out of the playpen!!! He complicates their lives and plays with a small Guillotine ( don&apos;t even think about it ) and the one good actor, Patricia Medina is given a rotten role of no consequence. There is also Maurice Chevalier being as always himself, and seemingly incapable of doing anything else as Brazzi&apos;s father. Accents clash again, even topping Kerr&apos;s excruciating high-pitched and immitating badly the Queen of England&apos;s voice. Negulesco directed some stinkers at the end of his career and this is one of them. Snobbish and unendurable this film grinds to a halt in one of the most absurd scenes I have ever seen in what is sometimes laughingly called the cinema. I recommed it to all those who kick expensive furniture ( as Kerr does ) and who say, &quot; I am not French!! I am English, English, English &quot;, and let them endure this travesty of cinematic self-indulgence.",

Powell and Harlow have wonderful chemistry. Both were natural, charismatic, and energetic performers. May Robson is a riot as Granny, and her scenes with Powell are gems.\n\nFranchot Tone plays a millionaire playboy crazy over Harlow; Powell loves her but doesn&apos;t come out and say it. It&apos;s a very old formula, but that doesn&apos;t matter. The film is interspersed with several musical numbers that aren&apos;t particularly inspiring. Harlow&apos;s singing is dubbed, and I suspect the actual dancing parts of her dancing were also. Who cares - she just radiated beauty, warmth, and vulnerability in everything she did. The musical sections were apparently thrown in after the film was made.\n\nI can&apos;t write for anyone else, but I was surprised when the film made its dramatic turn - and without giving anything away, particularly surprised Harlow went for it, until I read that she turned the film down because of it. William Powell convinced her to take the role. By the end of the film, we&apos;re in melodrama land. But the two stars pull it off, though it is truly ridiculous.\n\nA young Rosalind Russell has a supporting role and essays it beautifully. It&apos;s not a great movie, but the people in it surely are.",

The film - an eloquent and often tragic study of an ill-fated movie star Gaby Doriot who rises her way to a depressingly patriarchal world and later becomes a victim of its cruelty - is certainly nowhere near the richness, splendour, and lilting mastery of Ophüls&apos; celebrated later classics, but it is fascinating in its own ways. The intricate flashback structure and the beautiful Isa Miranda&apos;s heartbreaking incarnation of the spoiled Gaby seem to anticipate Ophüls&apos; later works, particularly his final masterpiece, &quot;Lola Montes&quot; (1955). The film is apparently not for every taste but if you are a fan of Ophuls as I am, it is an indispensable viewing."

      "reviewBody": "1st watched 8/21/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Ron Shelton): Well done good cop/bad cop movie that works because the good &amp; the bad are basically caught in the same trap and some of the characters change from one to the other during the film.  Kurt Russell&apos;s character is one of them that changes.  He is bad with a capital `B&apos; in the beginning.  He&apos;s foul-mouthed, racist and doesn&apos;t care much for justice but wants to cover the good guys&apos; behind whenever possible.  He is totally believable as this redneck character.  His partner is being taught to lie in what they call a `shooting trial&apos; where they question the cop on a convict-shooting to make sure it was the `only&apos; option.  The setting for the film is a few days before the `non-guilty&apos; Rodney King verdict in L.A., but this is only a backdrop to the movie&apos;s story.  There is typical corruption in the police ranks but in this one, the star is involved in the corruption.  Without giving away too much of the story, basically the cops are involved in another shooting and the partner decides to tell the truth which leads to other events that bring about the much-hoped-for ending.  It&apos;s neat the way the filmmaker uses the Rodney King fiasco to blend in with the action of the story which kind of adds a separate element that everyone is quietly following as they do their jobs.  The acting, the direction and the story blend together for a very satisfying and watchable movie despite the typical bad cop/good cop genre that the story is based on.  Hooray for all involved on this one!!",

      "reviewBody": "This is billed as a Burt Reynold&apos;s vehicle but he is actually part of a great cast in this Ed McBain 87th Precinct comedy-thriller. The police in Boston are searching for an extortionist dubbed &quot;The Deaf Man&quot; who is demanding cash or he kills a high ranking city official. Reynolds along with Tom Skeritt and Jack Weston are the cops on the case. The film really has a great ensemble feel and, I hope, accurately predicts the goings on inside a police station. Raquel Welch co-stars as a female detective out to snag a rapist. Yul Brynner, who must have been having lots of fun at this point in his career, is &quot;The Deaf Man.&quot; His screen time is minimal but he does a good job. Familiar faces pop up in nearly every other scene with guys like Charles Tyner, Albert Popwell, Tamara Dobson and a very young Charles Martin Smith in small roles. The film&apos;s only major problem is that it neatly wraps up everything in the end. Seriously, every crime the cops are investigating is solved in one scene that relies heavily on convenience.",

The Wyndham book had already been made into a movie called &quot;The Village of the Damned,&quot; and it is just amazing that the Thai film makers who spent years of their lives and millions of dollars in the production of &quot;Cuckoos&quot; never came across the English novel or movie.  It was hoped that this would be the first Thai movie released internationally, but of course once it was publicized that the movie was in violation of international copyright laws, these hopes were dashed.  The movie did not do well in Thailand, and journalists had a field day digging up others of MR Kukrit&apos;s many books that were obviously &quot;lifted&quot; from Western sources.  It is truly sad that this event was the last chapter to a wonderful, colorful, brilliant career.",

However, Miyuki and the teenagers Kazochi, Takumi, Hattori and Rieko have been submitted to a nightmarish experiment by Dr. Hattori and her team with tragic results.\n\n&quot;Kyôfu&quot; is an intriguing film, with a mad scientist that submits her daughters and other teenagers to creepy experiments that recalled me the Dharma Projet from &quot;Lost&quot;. Unfortunately the screenplay is a complete mess and despite the good acting, cinematography, make-up and effects, the film is unintelligible.

However, &quot;Cervantes&quot; has the advantage of being set in the 16th-century, when Christian and Islamic forces fought for control of the Mediterranean, and it&apos;s this rich background -- not often explored by the movies -- which gives &quot;Cervantes&quot; its points of interest. The casting here is also a notch better than usual, with acting honors going to Jose Ferrer as a Turkish Bey. And those viewers who dislike leading man Horst Buchholz will be pleased to learn that he&apos;s both flogged and racked in this movie and, at one point, almost beheaded.",

Thanks to &quot;Nazarin&quot; ,Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had not got a clue ) and to direct &quot;Viridiana&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Title: Leif Jonkers Darkness (1990) \n\nDirector: Leif Jonker \n\nReview: I always admire creative people who even though they might not have any resources go out of their way to make their dreams come true. There&apos;s something to be admired in that type of passion and determination. And Leif Jonkers had that and a whole lot more when he made Darkness.\n\nThe plot is about Toby, a young man whos whole family was murdered by a gang of vampires lead by an undead known as Liven. He joins forces with a bunch of other teenagers who upon returning from a Rock and Roll concert find that their parents have perished at the hands of Liven and his vampire gang as well.\n\nThis movie impressed me in many ways. OK, first off the movie is a no budget flick that was shot by a few teenagers and their friends in their own home town, so lets get any hopes for this being a mega budgeted high production right out of the way. This is first and foremost a ultra low budget independent film. Now, lets get to the good stuff. This movie kicks ass! Its got a lot of imagination. It might have had no budget but that doesn&apos;t mean that Leif Jonker didn&apos;t think up imaginative ways of overcoming their obstacles in making this vampire Opus! This is the type of film that makes me want to get up from my ass, buy a digital camera and start making my own independent film. Its got that energy and spark that only new comers who are hungry can give to their project and it is very evident in every inch of film.\n\nFirst off the flick opens with a bang in a gas station. This whole sequence was designed to grab you by the throat in the first opening minutes, and that it does! The pace of the movie is very fast and energetic, right from the get go, the movie never stops. Its like a roller coaster ride of vampiric thrills.\n\nThe movie has some well orchestrated moments spread evenly all through out. Starting with the gas station sequence, then the rading of a vampire layer which turns pretty bloody (chainsaws and all) the car wash sequence...the shoot out, I mean this movie has a bunch of interesting moments that keep the movie from being boring.\n\nThe gore is plentiful! No budget? Screw it! Lets throwing as much blood as we can for shock value alone! And gosh darned it I loved the cheap thrill of seeing those sprays of blood exploding on my TV. The deaths don&apos;t shy away from the red stuff like in todays PG-13 filled world. No, no, here the blood splashes all over the place right down to the ultra bloody as hell finale.\n\nSpeaking of the finale I loved the heck out of it. It had an Evil Dead vibe to it; though I&apos;m sure that was intentional because the film feels like something Raimi and Campbell could have cooked up in their early years. Its got that bravado of showing things raw, no candy coating whatsoever. That ending has got to be one of the bloodiest ending I&apos;ve ever seen. The special effects were fun, I couldn&apos;t get over the things these guys came up with on such a low budget (something like 5,000$) The only bad thing about the movie where its technical limitations. Its obvious that they lighted this movie the home made way, some scenes are too dark to make out, others where to bright. Still, you can tell that all Leif Jonker needed was a good lighting crew and a budget and the movie would have looked a heck of a lot more kick ass. But as it is, I let that slide because the movie was being so entertaining. Also some of the acting and dialog wasn&apos;t so hot. In other words, it has all the limitations of a no budget flick. But the fact that Leif Jonker could churn out such an entertaining flick with all these things against him speaks volumes of the talent that the guy has. I&apos;m sure given the right budget this guy could be a very good horror director.\n\nIn conclusion, Id say this is a fun movie to watch. Never boring, lots of energy and imagination. Hurray for Independent cinema and bring on Darkness 2! Rating: 4 out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "White Dog is often mentioned on lists of all-time most controversial films, and there&apos;s a good reason for that. Samuel Fuller&apos;s film is controversial because it confronts the theme of racism head on, and succeeds where modern films such as &apos;Crash&apos; fail in that it actually makes you think. Rather than actually being &apos;about&apos; racism, White Dog tells a story and lets the themes flow; thus meaning that the audience is allowed to see the themes shining through, rather than being beaten over the head with them. The film is really clever and is based on a premise that isn&apos;t immediately obvious. In fact, if it wasn&apos;t for a series of little niggles; this film would be an absolute masterpiece. The problems with the film are largely down to the execution, as Samuel Fuller uses too many close-up shots; and the scenes where the title animal attacks in particular suffer from poor editing, which means that it&apos;s sometimes difficult to tell exactly what&apos;s going on and most of the time gave me a headache. Furthermore, the plot doesn&apos;t move particularly well and the film can seem like it isn&apos;t going anywhere at times.\n\nIt&apos;s a good job, then, that Fuller utilises his themes so well. Racism isn&apos;t a subject that interests me generally (mostly because of tacky, sentimental dross like Crash), but the plot here is used in such a way that it&apos;s impossible not to be taken in by it. We follow a young aspiring actress that accidentally runs a dog over. After becoming attached to it, she decides to take it in; but pretty soon the dog attacks someone, and she finds out that aside from being a white dog, it&apos;s also a &apos;White Dog&apos;; a dog used by white people to kill blacks. The main reason why this film is so good is down to the title animal. Here we have an entity that is entirely innocent of its crimes; the guilty party being the racist that trained him. By letting us see what the dog is capable of, but making sure we know that the dog is only doing what it has been programmed to do ensures that the true horror of racism is allowed to shine through; as well as the futility of hatred down to skin colour. Films like White Dog are few and far between; here we have a movie that dares to tell a story despite its implications, and a movie that forces its audience to think about their own prejudices. It&apos;s just sad that we live in a world where films like Crash win Oscars while films like White Dog are banished into obscurity. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "Kurban pe koi mat hona Kurban. Its not that bad, you can go watch the movie and if you think its not going to be worth the money, then you can watch it in Single Screen theatres - Paisa Vasool!!\n\nScientific Miracles in the movie: * Scientific Miracle in the movie, even thought you cant see the bump that Kareena Kapoor is pregnant, we are able to see the ultrasonography of the child. *There is plane blast which is of course done digitally, but then we do not get to see the flying debris, anywhere in the movie. * An individual person can always remember a 10 digit mobile number, even if the person has randomly met or spoken only once on the phone. * Everyone dies in one bullet, but only the actor-hero of the movie, after 3 bullets is still alive for 15 minutes\n\nIn a few lines, Kareena Kapoor (Avantika) and Saif Ali Khan (Ishaan) are teachers. She is a professor in United States. She was here in India, cause her dad had a stroke. But later in and then flies out to the USA. Saif tags along with her. Just too realise that Saif is actually part of a terrorist group that is conspiring to blow up the city. The movie that comes to the mind is Fanaa and New York.\n\nThe movie takes its own sweet time and has its own pace. Sometimes, there is strong feeling of moving out of the theatre cause it is slow. But then, you also have the Kareena Kapoor who other than looking pretty, has not substance in her role. Her face is looking bigger or was it camera trick.\n\nSaif Ali Khan has done a better role in the Sriram Raghavan&apos;s movie Ek Hasina Thi and of course Omkara, there he was convinced us on the playing negative characters with complete ease. He slips here. For some particular reason, Vivek Oberoi had a good acting and lived in his character, with this movie, he surely be getting some push in his career.\n\nLesser mortals in the movie Kirron Kher is an Afgani in the movie, her dialect an as Afgani trails away while she having the conversation. She was good in the climax scene of the movie. Om Puri was wasted in the movie, he should have had a much more impactful role. Others are not worth mentioning.\n\nIf hockey got a boost from Chak De India, don&apos;t see teaching getting a boost in this case. But for one, you don&apos;t always have hot teachers in the staff room, cuddling or couching cooing. That is something I have to still see as a student or as a teacher.\n\nThis is a good song and even the opening credits, though very long was well done!! Enjoy!!",

This movie has much more hardcore fighting and explicit violence than the original,but it misses those important moments that the original had.\n\nEven though this movie does not show friendship and feelings like the original,it still is very entertaining.\n\nSo I advice all fans of the genre to go see this one,because it has some really impressing fighting scenes."

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s cut to the chase...the plot here in &quot;The Jungle&quot; is ridiculous. It&apos;s set in India and elephants have apparently been stampeding the countryside and killing many people. However, the great American hunter called in to take care of it, Steve Bentley (Rod Cameron) has just reported that everyone in his party but him got killed...and they were NOT elephants but Woolly Mammoths!! So, the determined Princess (Marie Windsor) heads into the jungle with her trusted Rama Singh (Cesar Romero) to see for herself...and Steve accompanies their party. \n\nIn addition to Woolly Mammoths, the film also features something common in the era...white folks playing the leading roles even though they are supposed to be Indians. Romero can kinda pull it off but Marie Windsor looks about as Indian as Lassie! I think the film was sepia tinted to try to hide this but it doesn&apos;t work well. Nowadays, such casting is seen as culturally insensitive and insulting. At least everyone else in the film appears to be Indian and the film DOES get the look and feel of India right and the animals seem to be more accurate than most B-movies (where you&apos;d see rhinos and kangaroos and more in the Indian jungle!). Considering it&apos;s a low-budget film, I was also surprised that some of the film was actually filmed in that country. So, culturally it&apos;s a mixed bag.\n\nSo is it any good? Of course not! It really can&apos;t be! It&apos;s a product of its times but really isn&apos;t all that great...at best a slow-paced and very silly time passer. But, when it comes to giant monster films, it&apos;s better than most (not that this is high praise!).\n\n\n\nBy the way, if you suffer from Ophidiophobia (the fear of snakes) skip this film. Trust me on this. Also, animal lovers might also want to avoid it as there&apos;s a scene where a tiger and Sloth Bear fight and it honestly looks like they just tossed &apos;em together and let them fight! Fortunately it APPEARS neither animal was seriously injured. Later, they toss a boar at a leopard! Great animal lovers they were NOT!",

      "reviewBody": "This film is about 2 guys and a girl, whose lives primarily intersect in an apartment that the girl, who is a real estate agent, is trying to sell. She brings guy #1, a street vendor, to the apartment for a sexual encounter, and he later ends up living there without her knowledge.  Unbeknownst to both of them, guy #2, a suicidally lonely gay man, has already crashed the place. Guy #1 and Guy#2 eventually bump into each other (it&apos;s a large apartment), and Guy#2, in his need for companionship, becomes attracted to Guy #1, despite the fact that Guy #1 does not possess very many redeeming qualities.\n\nI can&apos;t say that I enjoyed this film very much.  The acting was good, the directing was frank.  But throughout most of the film I kept asking myself where it was going.  There was very little development or dialogue. However, while I didn&apos;t particularly like watching the seemingly infinite shots, at the same time I appreciated the way that they developed the mood, perspective, and bleak tone of the film.  Mind you, this didn&apos;t don on me until near the end.  These 3 people were each very much alone, especially the girl and the gay guy.  Alone, and yet living in a large metropolis and surrounded by people.  The &quot;climax&quot; of the film, where the girl is walking through the park, (the most barren, dead, and desolate public park I&apos;ve ever seen.), made perfect sense.  The surroundings were an achingly appropriate reflection of the girl&apos;s emotional state in life and the starkness of what her outlook must have been.  When she sat down on the bench and started to sob, everything just clicked.  I thought to myself &quot;My god, I know exactly how she feels.&quot;  That was my big revelation with this movie, when I related to her character.  And because of this, the film held a special poignance to me.  While I can&apos;t say that I was entertained by this film, I can say that I was impacted.  It reminded me that the point of a movie can serve a more dignified purpose than just appealing to an audience as entertainment."

      "reviewBody": "Erica Bain is a talk-radio host in New York, specialising in spots that are close to poetry on various subjects. She has everything going for her in her career and also in her personal life as she prepares for her marriage to Dr David Kirmani. They are walking their dog in the park as they often do when their dog goes missing. They find it shortly after but a group of young men have found it already. They demand money for the dog back but it doesn&apos;t end there as they get more violent and begin beating the couple while another of the group films it. It is some time before Erica comes to in hospital  badly beaten and reeling from the news of David&apos;s death. Scared of the places she once loved, Erica gets an unregistered gun for protection but soon finds herself in situations where others would seek to hurt her. She reacts with the gun, killing three criminals in two incidents. While shocked by her behaviour, she is also remarkably calm.\n\nThe Brave One was a &quot;big&quot; film in regards posters and cinema coverage in the UK but yet none of the marketing really told me much about it and seemed to concentrate on the big names involved rather than content. I&apos;m sure there were trailers that did it well that I didn&apos;t see but to me the impression was of a film that didn&apos;t seem sure how to sell itself to the audience. It LOOKED liked it was just a modern version of Death Wish but the presence of Foster made me hope that it would be more  not to mention the polished looks, big budget and Hollywood-feel. The film doesn&apos;t start in a way that would suggest that though as we are introduced to the &quot;perfect&quot; man in Foster&apos;s life, knowing that his sole function in the film is that he will die  which he does at the hands of &quot;Bad Men&quot;. After this we do get some tentative steps as Bain struggles with her fear and anger but, once she has her outlet the film doesn&apos;t look back.\n\nThe plot is straightforward all the way. The delivery suggests that it wants to come over as complex and deep but it is never anything of the sort and instead it is a surprisingly simplistic affair that is no better than Winner&apos;s original film. The motives of the characters are drawn in big blocks with no detail or finesse and, as a result, I was left uninterested and unconvinced by the characters  never really believing them. It plods along with its black/white politics to a conclusion that is a morally-murky cop-out that was only memorable for how &quot;have my cake and eat it&quot; it all was. I shouldn&apos;t have been that surprised though as this was in keeping with the whole film.\n\nFoster tries her best but there is nothing for her to work with of interest and the material doesn&apos;t offer her complexity to explore or development to exploit. Instead she focuses on &quot;looking intense&quot; most of the time, perhaps hoping that in itself this will suffice (it doesn&apos;t). Conversely Howard just does this weird &quot;softly complex&quot; thing that brings just as much depth (or as little rather) to his character as Foster does to hers. The support cast all do as required  nobody stood out for reasons of performance but rather for their fame in other things (Lost&apos;s Andrews) or family (Lenny Kravitz&apos;s daughter Zoë).\n\nThe Brave One is all dressed up in its fancy clothes to look like a modern, thoughtful take on Death Wish. It even has big, award-winning stars at its helm to show that it is anything but sordid or simplistic. Problem is  nobody passed this message to the writers and the material is as morally dubious as it is basic. Money has clearly been spent and the film LOOKS good but ultimately it goes nowhere, offers little and has morals that are hard to take and don&apos;t even trying to argue that it is a grey area of complexity, instead making it all black and white. Professional enough to fool some into thinking it is better than it is, but ultimately this is a basic and dodgy thriller that doesn&apos;t engage or thrill."

      "reviewBody": "Having also seen the ultra-violent Death Race in the same week as The House Bunny I realized one big thing; clichéd violence doesn&apos;t offer any kind of real reaction whereas clichéd humor can still manage to make you laugh as long as the delivery is entertaining and fresh. Sure, the dumb blond jokes in The House Bunny are old and played out, but Anna Faris gives you continuing reason to laugh in a film that is far funnier than it really deserves to be. The House Bunny plays on the sexy-but-dumb stereotype to the fullest extent and Faris has proved in the past, as a regular in the otherwise awful Scary Movie films, she can pull this off. On top of looking amazing, Faris gives this film every reason to exist. Co-stars Emma Stone, Kat Dennings and the increasingly emaciated Rumer Willis offer up a couple of additional laughs, but it is Faris that leads the charge. She plays right up to the edge of the dumb blond stereotype and only occasionally tosses in one too many clichéd jokes. Nevertheless, you forgive her thanks to a consistent number of chuckles throughout the film. \n\nThis isn&apos;t to say this is a classic comedy by any means, but anyone that goes to see House Bunny should walk away with a smile. This isn&apos;t a film to hate, it offers up exactly what the trailers promise and it delivers a little extra with an unexpected f-bomb dropped in the mix and a peek at Faris&apos;s little bum to keep the men paying attention. \n\nPerhaps the one major shock would be Colin Hanks; it seems those Tom Hanks genes aren&apos;t quite paying off just yet. After a decent sized role in Peter Jackson&apos;s King Kong, Hanks has only managed to worm his way into mediocre films at best. Then again, he hasn&apos;t shown anyone any reason to give him anything with more meat on it so I guess I shouldn&apos;t be too surprised. Katherine McPhee of &quot;American Idol&quot; fame plays a small role in the feature as does Beverly D&apos;Angelo, but both are relatively inconsequential. \n\nThe ladies in the audience are more likely to get a kick out of The House Bunny and the fellas dragged to the theater with them should be able to enjoy themselves as well despite the estrogen oozing of the screen. It isn&apos;t like this is a film you should rush out to the theater to see, but you could definitely do worse in your selection.",

      "reviewBody": "I suppose how horrible you think Doctor Hitchcock is depends on your own view of necrophilia. I mean, sure, the first time we see him he&apos;s bashed the head of a gravedigger so he can have a quick go on a corpse&apos;s paps, but then he did show his kinder side by also being the Doctor who stitched up the poor guy&apos;s head at the hospital later. And it&apos;s not necrophilia is his wife is still alive, and only looks dead because of the drugs he pumps her full of, is it? It&apos;s a complicated issue.\n\nThis film also gives us a Double Scouse Lead Actor Line-up! (or D.S.L.A.L for short)! Not only do we have Birkenhead born Barbara Steele in the film, but playing Doctor Hitchcock is Liverpool born actor Roberyt Flemyng! Very little is known of this actor, except that he was an aristocratic-looking character actor, with a 60-year long theatrical career stretching back to 1931. The son of a Liverpool physician, he had a brief medical career, which he abandoned in preference to becoming a thespian. Rose to prominence as Keit Neilan in &apos;French Without Tears&apos; in 1936. Thereafter, had leading roles on the London and Liverpool stages. Also appeared on Broadway and went on tour in 1952 opposite Katherine Cornell in &apos;The Constant Wife&apos;. During World War II, he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, reaching the rank of full colonel. He was awarded the MC (Military Cross) in 1941, mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the military OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1944 King&apos;s Honours List for his services to the Royal Army. On 21st March, 1995, he suffered a serious stroke and was for a time comatose. He eventually recovered consciousness, but was incapable of speech and was limited in his movements. He died as a patient in St. Thomas&apos;s Hospital in London in the early hours of May 22nd, but that&apos;s all I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nBarbara by the way is Dr Hitchcock&apos;s second wife, because Hitchcock accidentally killed his first wife with those drugs while trying to turn her into a fake-corpse. Hitchcock, after twelve years, has now returned to his creepy old mansion with Barabararararara, who immediately takes a dislike to meddlesome ratbag housemaid Harriet White. After some screaming is heard, an alarmed Barararararbara is told that&apos;s just Harriet&apos;s crazy sister and that she&apos;s getting shipped off to some loony bin the next day. If that&apos;s the case, however, who&apos;s running around laughing, being spooky, and making use of the mansion&apos;s standard-issue secret passageways? And why is that creepy cat still alive after twelve years?\n\nBarbara Steele sure does a lot of fainting in this film! Someone leaves a skull in her bed = faint. She&apos;s out in the garden when a ghostly bridesmaid runs about = faint. She looks through a keyhole and sees someone preparing a noose = keels over. That last one doesn&apos;t work out too well for her either. Someone&apos;s up to something, and while all that&apos;s happening Dr Hitchcock is getting a hankering for some cold flesh, and constantly nearly keeps getting caught at the hospital morgue for this troubles (mainly by suspicious Silvano Tranquili, who has the hots for Barbara).\n\nI&apos;m going to level with you here and say that this film isn&apos;t exactly a white knuckle ride. It&apos;s pure undiluted Gothic horror that takes it&apos;s sweet time getting to conclusion, but just like his other film The Ghost, Riccardo Freda makes good use of colour and throws in loads of mood (and thunderstorms, don&apos;t forget thunderstorms). There&apos;s one particularly weird scene where Barbara hallucinates Hitchcock&apos;s face swelling up while red light fills the screen. That said, I do prefer the Ghost if I had to compare the two.",

Movies that made me talk about it for weeks, movies I repeatedly recommend to everyone. Bunohan made it to the list alongside Kaki Bakar, Dari Jemapoh ke Manchestee and surprisingly, Khabir Bhatia&apos;s Cinta.\n\nI should applaud the director who unburied the best of the actors. Pekin Ibrahim should be lauded for making a character so typical so convincing. Familiar names like Faizal Hussein and Zahiril known to be good actors delivered something extraordinary not only to the viewers&apos; eyes but also piercing to the heart.\n\nI like to put Bunohan on the same level as There Will be Blood in term of the emotions projected. Bunohan doesn&apos;t offer beautiful scenery to help its beautiful cinematography but instead it uses beautiful cinematography to create a powerful mood.\n\nI feel like I&apos;m having such a limited film vocabulary to do justice to Bunohan. But suffice to say that I can see the bright future of Malaysian film post-U-Wei Shaari.",

I thought it was a good twist and I love movies that allow enough time for you to work out the ending or who it was! So some might say it was a &apos;slow&apos; film. But it kept me interested long enough. It has pretty much no romance in it though. But I have grown to love the main character in lots of her movies overtime. So if your running low on movies to watch or a little bored you could enjoy this one. I enjoyed it. Corny, Mystery and humour all in the one. so i have rated it 7/10 because it doesn&apos;t really tickle my sensitive nerve which i love when movies do.",

      "reviewBody": "My grandpa&apos;s first reaction when he heard this movie was being released was -why? Why yet another movie about Dillinger? What can it add? My grandpa&apos;s question triggered my thinking. Movies and Hollywood filmmakers don&apos;t seem to care anymore about adding something to history or the medium. They just seem to compulsively adapt other movies, toy lines or videogames into modern reworkings. It&apos;s a culture of thoughtless recycling. Fortunately, and although I haven&apos;t seen the &apos;30s or &apos;70s biopics, Michael Mann does have something to show.\n\nThe first surprise is how the movie is shot. As one of the most vocal followers of digital video, Mann seems to exploit its handicaps instead of trying to convince us it can look as good as film. Throughout the movie we&apos;re treated to 3D video feel, artificial grain and close-ups which show up every pore on the actors skins. It&apos;s like someone sent a documentary crew back in time. However, this incongruous approach also made me experience the 1930s in a way I&apos;d never done before, as a reality instead of a postcard. Almost all movie depictions of the &quot;public enemies&quot; era (even the gritty ones, like Bonnie and Clyde) are stylish and sophisticated. Instead, Mann&apos;s compulsive attention to prop and costume detail combined with the hand-held camera-work are immediately urging and attention-grabbing.\n\nMann, as a filmmaker, always seemed to me more interested in technique than depth or story. This is arguably the same film he has made twice before (I&apos;m talking about Thief and Heat), only this time history-based. As I read on about Dillinger and Melvin Purvis after watching the film, I realized the movie&apos;s script is very unusual in that it almost seems to strip the juicy bits out of the story. Where is the scene with the people soaking their handkerchiefs on Dillinger&apos;s blood, or the &apos;30s era depression portrait? Like you guys were saying, Little Bohemia was in fact an embarrassment to the FBI in which civilians got shot and the criminal walked away unharmed. Except for a weird scene in which Dillinger walks into the Chicago police station and wanders around, there&apos;s a very down-to-earth approach to the character, taking away his more mythical elements and leaving us with a career robber who, like James Caan&apos;s character in Thief, seems to abstractly decide to fall in love to make up for lost time.\n\nThe movie focuses obsessively on this relationship, instead of the more obvious paths it could have taken. Hoover&apos;s incompetence and his closet homosexuality are brief side notes. So is Melvin Purvis. The movie strips him of a personality, showing only the professional side of the policeman. This is so evident that when the title card near the end informs us that he later shot himself, I had to laugh it was so random. I seem to be speaking against all of this, but in fact what I&apos;m doing is pointing out how unusual all of these directorial choices are. In fact, I celebrate them. Public Enemies is a movie that might seem frustrating to many, but to me, it was a refreshing, exciting journey into a world too often depicted and too easily neutralized. It&apos;s a great thing to see a copmen-and-robbers film without feeling like I&apos;ve seen it all before. And make no mistake, the film&apos;s action scenes are intense.\n\nI&apos;d like to finish by pointing out that the movie has a hell of a cast. Johnny Depp is a revelation in a time when it looked like his awesomeness was exhausting itself. Christian Bale is not given much to do as Purvis, but he&apos;s competent, mostly the Bale serious face we see too much of all the time. Billy Crudup&apos;s Hoover is great, he deserves his own flick. Marion Cotillard is a great foil to Depp. There are a lot of very famous faces on the film (in fact, maybe too many), and some of them are only in for very brief seconds - Lily Tomlin, Giovanni Ribisi and Leelee Sobieski enter and leave the screen and they&apos;re all very good, but none have any big scenes. This might be the artsiest blockbuster I&apos;ve ever seen. Which, in my mind, is a compliment.",

We are introduced to Jack (Owen), an average guy who tries (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a writer. He lives a with his girlfriend Marion (McKee), an ex-cop who is deeply in love with him (while he is quite more reserved in his feelings). However, after his father arranges for him a job offer as a croupier in a casino, his life gets completely transformed: His new world and the creatures that live in it begin to devour him, and his character gets gradually reshaped. He is faced with corruption, lust, and ultimately, crime, and Marion does not seem to have the ability to bring him back.\n\nMike Hodges gives us an excellent account of Jack&apos;s world, with the characters being vividly and convincingly portrayed. A small plot twist in the end adds up to the overall excitement.\n\nClive Owen is simply superb as the icy croupier, who although he tries to be detached, he simply cannot (and probably does not want to) escape from his downhill path. We also enjoy very good performances by all the other actors involved.\n\n8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never seen an Indonesian film before, and the last film I&apos;d expect from there is some gory horror film as I know they&apos;re a very conservative country who even reject Lady Gaga! Macabre is much more sickening than Gaga. The formula has been used many times before but to me it&apos;s far from tired. I love horror films that take place in a house run by a demented, murdering family. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Frontiers come to mind (both are favourites of mine) and Macabre offers quite an impressive and thrilling spin! We&apos;ve all heard the story before, but a lot of films tend to get it very wrong, focusing on way too much exposition before getting down to the horror. Macabre gets down to it quite quickly, giving us an interesting half hour build up before all hell breaks loose! The great thing about Macabre is that it is never boring, there is always something going on very much like the remake of Mother&apos;s Day. One big problem with Macabre is that it&apos;s over-populated with way too many characters who all look very similar, or don&apos;t really have much character to them. Macabre lacks the character development that is needed in the slasher department, however that&apos;s not to say that aren&apos;t some character&apos;s to root for.\n\nAt one point the film becomes so over-populated it&apos;s nay on impossible to tell what&apos;s going on! However, part of Macabre&apos;s entertainment value lies in its chaos. Make no mistake, Macabre is an extremely solid and very re-watchable horror film that would be perfect for those nights where you have a little party! It&apos;s a non-stop roller-coaster ride which serves up some extremely nasty treats. The character of Dara is memorably creepy and she&apos;s certainly a person you would not like to mess with. Her wide eyes, scraped-back hair and slow mechanical voice makes her a fantastic villain and one that you&apos;re not likely to forget.\n\nAnother great thing about Macabre is that it has a very similar idea to blood and gore as French horror. That means it doesn&apos;t hold back! I think every scene features some pretty horrific gore which all adds to the entertainment and thrills. There are some really great practical effects, and inventive kills that should have horror fans drooling at the mouth. Macabre has been likened to Inside but I personally don&apos;t see that, other than there being a pregnant character in both films, and both showing a liberal idea to the use of blood, Macabre is much more Frontiers-esque. However, I don&apos;t think that Macabre is up to Frontiers&apos; perfection.\n\nFrontiers exceeds in every way possible. Through the directing, writing, character development, music and editing. Whilst Macabre is pretty solid on the writing front some of the directing is slightly off-key, although most of the time it&apos;s pretty impressive with the Mo Brothers being sure not to film the action too shaky or too close so we can&apos;t see what the hell is going on! Macabre is quite choppy on the editing front and some of the lighting is also quite amateurish. However, I don&apos;t want to dwell too much on the negatives because this is actually a really good film and one which I enjoyed very much.\n\nWhilst Macabre may not be the horror masterpiece the trailer would suggest it still serves up some hardcore horror thrills that makes a good substitute for French horror. It&apos;s way better than most American stuff to come out and is never boring. In fact, I would&apos;ve liked to have seen even more! The ending is creepy and the supernatural ideas also add an original and quite disturbing quality to the film. My only real gripe is that I bought the UK version and it might just be my DVD but it seemed incredibly blotchy to me, making the blacks appear more greyish-blue than black, which is a shame with the film spending the majority of the time in the dark! It kind of spoilt the experience for me. Hopefully the film will get a well deserved wider release with a better transfer. Highly recommend to all you horror lovers!",

      "reviewBody": "After a seven year absence from the screen, Michael Myers returns. Set ten years after the first two films (#2 was filmed in 1981, but set immediately after #1 in 1978), THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS opens with the infamous killer being transfered between psyhiciatric hospitals. Naturally, he escapes, and, tipped off that he has a niece (daugther of the now-deceased Jamie Lee Curtis character) living in Haddonfield, sets out to find her. Hot on his trail, as always, is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). After some were turned off by the more-gruesome deaths in HALLOWEEN 2, this film is more in-line with the original, relying more heavily on suspense and honest scares than blood and gore. For a nine-year-old, Harris delivers a good performance, and Donald Pleasence (as usual) is also good, with a performance that lets you know this is a been-there-don&apos;t-want-to-go-through-that-again character. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. Thankfully, the make-shirt mob of gun-toting beer-guzzlers isn&apos;t as bad as it could have been. HALLOWEEN 4 is one of the best of the series."

Those expecting Bay pyrotechnics will rightfully feel cheated. &apos;Love&apos; is a film about the human condition, not science, and an unexpected jewel of a film. \n\nSet in the near future, Captain Lee Miller is the first in twenty years to board the ISS space station, assigned to repair and reactivate. Early in the mission all contact with earth is lost after a final apologetic recorded message of &apos;things going on down here&apos; and advice to hold tight. Interspersed with events from the American Civil War, numerically indexed testimonials and reminisces of random strangers, encroaching hallucinations and madness, &apos;Love&apos; documents Lee desperately following that advice to the end as ISS fails around him.\n\n&apos;Love&apos; is beautifully shot and beautifully paced. Rare today it treats every character with respect and dignity, always inclusive and never ridiculing. Emotions and reactions ring true. The dialogue is intelligent and real. The score is perfect. It demands attention, setting fleetingly on critical plot elements, not a movie that rewards distractions. A surprise future classic worth seeing.",

With Lee&apos;s own little foray into the basketball world, I always wondered when he would create a story which reflected his unique views of the game. While sometimes over sensationalized, he depicted a seedy world comprised of two-faced individuals all the way down to the seedy high school coach to the professional agent. I also felt it depicted some very frank images of the cultural aspects of athletics, the sex, the money and the little freebies. While the film didn&apos;t need the story between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich, it was strong in most aspects. It was a bit of a change of pace for Spike Lee, considering the graininess of the film stock and the rather mundane colors. Also, Ray Allen had one of the best pro athletes-turned-actor performances in a long time.",

I longed for Joseph Losey at the helm and Dirk Bogarde, Sarah Miles and Alan Bates as the protagonists. Emily Watson is always marvelous but here, she doesn&apos;t have the kind of support she, as an actress or as a character, deserved and/or needed. Tom Wilkinson, as good as he is, doesn&apos;t have the layers of a Dirk Bogarde or James Mason. He is exactly what you get and Rupert Everett, who became a star overnight with Julian Mitchell&apos;s &quot;Another Country&quot; has taken a strange and puzzling road. His close ups are kind of frightening. His mouth has become the center of attention and not the kind of attention one would expect. It belongs to the villain in a horror movie. I noticed that already in his comedy with Madonna. I know, perhaps, all this sounds irrelevant but it conditioned my response to &quot;Separate Lies&quot; I wanted to be riveted and I wasn&apos;t.",

Yes, it is a thriller, but you will laugh at the dialogs and the twists at the end made my stomach pain.\n\nAnoop Menon disappoints, while Unnimenon is lame in his own style, Asif Ali seems to be playing his real life character in all his movies including this while the Mollywood&apos;s latest import is sheer dummy. It is this movie, that we interpret that she cannot act, talk or laugh. Thattathin Marayathu was a gimmick for her.\n\nThe locales have not been harnessed properly while the soundtrack is inspiring but the screenplay and the score don&apos;t match each other. Writing is fresh, but many important plot points were skipped and the cinematography is very poor. Non-linear story-telling wasn&apos;t executed properly and too much detailing towards the end spoils this script.\n\nFirst half is very suspense-filled but second half is full of songs and buffoonery which makes it an annoying drama. I am sad that such a beautiful cast (except the lead lady) was wasted with such a bad execution of a good plot. The humor isn&apos;t humor here. It is spalstickish parody. References made were too ballisitc and the English prose just didn&apos;t fit in.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: 75% Not recommended. Performances aren&apos;t charming, but if you have free time and want some nerve-racked, watch it!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: Strong | Sex, Nudity or Mouth-Kiss: No, Implied | Violence: Strong | Gore: No | Alcohol: Strong | Smoking or Drugs: No",

      "reviewBody": "Project Wolf Hunting is One Crazy Ride. It is impossible to discuss the details of this film without giving spoilers so I will not provide too many facts about the plot and storyline. Project Wolf Hunting is a hyper violent, science fiction, action film that is a lot of fun to watch.\n\nThe story surrounds an attempt to transport extradited, deadly prisoners from the Philippines to Korea on a ship secured by the authorities for that purpose. Through a series of incidents the prisoners manage to get free and seek to take over the ship. This part of the film is solid, bloody and violent cops and robbers action which is very gripping and well done. The psychotic nature of some of the prisoners makes the revolt particularly gruesome. HAd this been the entire plot of the movie I think it would have been shorter, but still very good.\n\nAfter one hour into the film it takes a turn into the realm of science fiction in a way that I didn&apos;t see coming, was very resistant to, but ended up really getting engrossed in. It ratchets up the violence and blood in the film to a level rarely seen in modern action and sci-fi.\n\nWhile you need to suspend belief to enjoy this one, it is not hard. The action, direction,and cinematography all make for a visually engrossing thrill ride. The characters are all interesting and the actors do a good job of &quot;buying in&quot; to the storyline and subplot.\n\nThe action and fight sequences are plentiful and fun to watch; although, I am not sure there is as much blood in the human body and the filmmakers seem to display.\n\nProject Wolf Hunting is worth seeing, but not for the Squeamish.\n\nKorean with English Sub-titles.",

All the elements of many a subsequent gangster picture are here: The close personal relationship between the antagonists (gang boss Wolheim and cop Thomas Meighan); the kid brother whom the gangster wants to shelter from the rackets (George E. Stone, soon to appear in LITTLE CAESAR and many another gangster flick), but who runs afoul of a tough little chanteuse (Marie Prevost). Mob bosses cavorting in lavish nightclubs, overwrought gangland funerals, crooked politicians, a wet-behind-the-ears reporter with two old pros as a chorus: it&apos;s all here. \n\nEnough of the action takes place in a run-down precinct house to belie the story&apos;s stage origins, but there&apos;s plenty of action, including a shootout between two rival gangs, to keep things hopping.",

The suits and make-up are quite brilliant, but the icing on the cake is the Guyver itself - its exactly the way I pictured it to be when I saw the cartoons. The movie isn&apos;t for everyone, the storyline may seem weak on the outside, but if you pay close attention to it, it is quite well thought out. The acting is corny, but come on, is there anyone who would see a movie that even has &quot;spectacular martial arts action&quot; in the tagline for its acting? If you are considering seeing this, I believe it would be a better idea to hire the original 1-12 manga series and the first live-action movie, The Guyver (aka Mutronics).",

I have yet to see the first instalment but have seen the second, Commando Leopard (1985), which I thought was quite good. This final entry, however, I didn&apos;t think so much of. The plot involved a group or mercenaries, lots of gun shooting, explosions and a top secret floppy disc. It was an entirely tiresome story-line quite honestly and a film in which you have to have a considerable interest in exploding helicopters and gun battles if you are going to get much out of it. I am somewhat ambivalent about action movies myself but I do enjoy some, such as the previous instalment in this series. But this one I essentially found to be a tedious series of action and dialogue scenes. Basically I have found that all films that focus on top secret floppy discs are awful.\n\nThe cast is actually not bad though. We have b-movie legends such as Lee Van Cleef and Donald Pleasence and cult favourites such as Bobby Rhodes (the best cinematic pimp of all time from Demons (1985) and Demons 2 (1986)) and John Steiner (from Dario Argento&apos;s seminal giallo Tenebrae (1982). But the impressive cast can&apos;t save this one. It was also decidedly overlong for what it was and by the end I was just glad it was over.",

I may be biased because I like fantasy films a lot. Nevertheless, in some areas it was a little slow, especially at the beginning, but it does pick as the story continues. \n\nTypical fantasy romance film plot, but it is fun to watch.I liked the fact that the story occurred in an isolated town and the rest of the world being completely oblivious to the existence of witches. Personally it made me feel as if something like this, no matter how absurd, could actually be happening.\n\nNote- this is my first ever review and it is rushed, so be nice.",

The story involves an architect whose unrequited love signs him a pact with the Norse demon Fenrir, who takes control of his body. Werewolfish Fenrir can only be destroyed by a Christopher Lambert-esque clock maker and a well-read teenage boy. David Newman&apos;s (Heathers, Frankenweenie) melodramatic score makes this movie stand up a notch above the rest. This one is a winner for fans of movies like Warlock and Bad Moon."

Good but not great this film never really added up to much more than people moving around trying to figure out who the villain was and to stay far enough on his good side that they didn&apos;t end up dead. To be honest while it isn&apos;t a bad movie, its quite good, its very generic as these things go, blending so much into the mass of German Wallace films that I started to nod off towards the end. Its not the fault of the film entirely since I am under the weather, but at the same time I kind of allowed my self to drift because I sort of felt I knew where it was going. Worth a look on Late night TV or if you are in an undemanding mood.",

Even though the movie can catch one&apos;s attention for its full running time, some of the desired tension and drama are missing, and much of the final outcome is quite predictable. Overall, it&apos;s certainly no Oscar candidate, but also doesn&apos;t deserve low ratings as some (politically motivated) users distribute.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometime in the not-too-distant future, psychologist Kris Kelvin is sent to a space station above the oceanic planet Solaris, tasked with determining the viability of its ongoing study. Upon his arrival, he finds the station in a state of disrepair, and learns that one of the scientists there has killed himself. Kelvin discovers a message from the dead man, warning him about strange things happening aboard the station. Alongside the remaining scientists, who seem verging on insanity, Kelvin begins to experience the inexplicable. Will he be able to make it back to Earth and, even if he&apos;s able; will he want to go?\n\nDirected by Andrei Tarkovsky and based on the novel of the same name by Stanislaw Lem, &apos;Solaris&apos; is a fascinating science-fiction drama, both visually striking and thought-provoking. Written alongside Fridrikh Gorenshteyn, Tarkovsky&apos;s narrative delves into a multitude of themes, from the labyrinth of regret and grief to the ephemeral nature of memory and perception. Often compared to Stanley Kubrick&apos;s &apos;2001 A: Space Odyssey,&apos; it is a film that different viewers will interpret in different ways, inviting one to reflect on one&apos;s own experiences and the constructs of reality.\n\nThroughout the film, Tarkovsky poignantly explores the human psyche, confronting his characters with their past actions and unspoken sorrows. The sentient ocean of Solaris acts as a catalyst for this introspection, materializing their innermost regrets into tangible forms. This externalization of grief forces the characters- and, by extension, the audience- to confront the often-painful process of healing on the road to closure.\n\nMoreover, Tarkovsky depicts memory as a malleable and unreliable entity, challenging the very notion of objective reality. The film questions whether one&apos;s memories serve as faithful records of one&apos;s past or are merely reconstructions subject to our current emotions and desires. Furthermore, Tarkovsky invites viewers to ponder the constructs of reality. Are our experiences genuinely authentic, or are they merely reflections of our deepest fears and wishes? Blurring the lines between the real and the imagined, Tarkovsky creates a film that transcends traditional storytelling: a mirror, reflecting not just the characters&apos; truths but also those of the audience.\n\nEach of Tarkovsky&apos;s characters serves as a vessel for exploring these profound themes. Kelvin is our guide through the enigmatic world of the film, a man of science confronted with phenomena that challenge his empirical beliefs. His journey is one of internal conflict, as he grapples with the manifestations of his own psyche, which Solaris brings to life. The character of Hari, meanwhile, is the personification of Kelvin&apos;s deepest regrets. Her presence on the station is a constant reminder of a past that he cannot escape, making her a pivotal figure in the narrative&apos;s exploration of memory and loss.\n\nThe supporting characters of Dr. Snaut and Dr. Sartorius are not just colleagues aboard the station but represent different facets of the human response to the unknown. Snaut reflects the weariness of facing the inexplicable, while Sartorius embodies the struggle between scientific detachment and the undeniable impact of Solaris&apos; influence. Through each of these characters, Tarkovsky crafts a narrative that is as much about the individual&apos;s inner space as it is about the outer cosmos, where the boundaries between the mind and the external world are blurred.\n\nThe film is not just a feast for the mind; it is also a feast for the eyes. Tarkovsky&apos;s mastery of visual storytelling is evident in every frame. He juxtaposes lingering shots of the space station&apos;s sterile corridors with the lush, almost dreamlike sequences on Earth, creating a dichotomy that mirrors the inner turmoil of the characters. The starkness of the station, with its endless hallways and cold light, stands in contrast to the vibrancy of Earth, emphasizing the isolation and alienation felt by the crew.\n\nIn addition, Tarkovsky&apos;s use of symbolism- particularly through shots of water- weaves a thread through the narrative, representing the fluidity of time and memory. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov&apos;s camera lingers on scenes of rain, pools and oceans, inviting the audience to contemplate the depths beneath the surface of the characters&apos; minds. Moreover, the use of colour is sparse yet impactful, with the muted palette of the station being punctuated by moments of vivid recollection. The lighting is purposeful, often using shadows and silhouettes to create an atmosphere of mystery and introspection.\n\nFurthermore, Mikhail Romadin&apos;s production design, as well as the set design from S. Gavrilov and V. Prokofev, are testaments to the film&apos;s meticulous craftsmanship. The space station, with its utilitarian yet broken-down features, creates a palpable sense of claustrophobia and decay, reflecting the psychological state of its inhabitants. The attention to detail in the set decoration, from the technological instruments to the personal artifacts, adds layers of authenticity and depth, making the environment a character in its own right.\n\nAdditionally, Nelli Fomina&apos;s costume design is equally striking. The functional, uniform-like attire of the characters not only situates the story within the realm of science-fiction but also symbolizes their attempts to maintain order amidst the chaos of the station. The costumes are devoid of excess, aligning with the film&apos;s themes of stripping away superficial layers to reveal deeper truths. Combined with the production design and set decoration, a visual narrative is formed, which complements the story and its themes. They are not merely aesthetic choices but are integral to the storytelling, contributing to the film&apos;s haunting, timeless and immersive atmosphere.\n\nMoreover, the haunting score and soundtrack are integral to this immersive air. Eduard Artemyev&apos;s electronic music composition, interspersed with classical pieces by Bach, creates a soundscape both ethereal and deeply resonant. The music serves as a reflection of the film&apos;s exploration of time and memory, while the juxtaposition of futuristic sounds and classical harmony underscores the themes of past and future, science and humanity.\n\nFurthermore, Tarkovsky, Lyudmila Feyginova and Nina Marcushe&apos;s editing is another aspect that deserves recognition. Although some critics are quick to call the film slow-moving, each carefully considered cut enhances the narrative&apos;s dreamlike quality. The film&apos;s purposeful, meditative pace allows the viewer to inhabit the space and time of the story, to become an active participant in the unravelling of its enigmas, whilst ensuring the audience fully absorbs the complex emotional and philosophical layers of the story. The transitions between scenes are seamless, yet carry a weight that prompts contemplation, further drawing the viewer into the depths of the film&apos;s enigmatic world.\n\nDonatas Banionis stars as Kelvin, opposite Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari, Jüri Järvet as Dr. Snaut and Anatoliy Solonitsyn as Dr. Sartorius. Banionis, dubbed by Vladimir Zamanskiy, delivers a nuanced portrayal of a man caught between the realms of rationality and the unexplainable, capturing Kelvin&apos;s internal struggle subtly- his face often conveying more than words could express. Opposite him, Bondarchuk is nothing short of captivating, bringing a haunting presence to the screen. Embodying the film&apos;s themes of love, loss and the desire for connection, her portrayal of Hari is both ethereal and deeply human, a reflection of Kelvin&apos;s own conflicted emotions.\n\nJärvet does similarly fine work, providing a weary yet compassionate perspective, offering a glimpse into the toll that Solaris takes on the mind and spirit. His performance is understated but powerful, with moments of vulnerability revealing the character&apos;s depth. Solonitsyn, meanwhile, is the embodiment of scientific detachment, his stoic demeanour clashing with the inexplicable events (and more emotionally driven people) aboard the station. His cleverly measured performance is compelling, and he and the rest of the cast work well together.\n\nA thought-provoking, compelling piece of science-fiction, Andrei Tarkovsky&apos;s &apos;Solaris&apos; is much more than a Soviet &apos;2001: A Space Odyssey.&apos; In fact, comparing the films, it is arguably the better of the two. Tarkovsky infuses the narrative with thematic depth, inviting viewers on a journey that is as introspective as it is outwardly explorative. Boasting stunning cinematography and stellar production, set and costume design, as well as a stirring score and powerhouse performances from all in the cast, &apos;Solaris&apos; is a cosmic symphony resonating far beyond the stars.",

Somehow a vat of toxic waste makes it&apos;s connection with one rednecked family&apos;s moonshine.  Before you know it......Zombie/Cannibal festival. While this is going down we have a subplot, i.e. potential victims/survivors  added to the mix.  A group of mismatched folks who look more like the local Smyrna drama club, than a bunch of hearty campers, start hiking through the danger zone.  You can probably figure out what happens next.  Being that this is Troma there will be lots of blood and guts.  The movie, despite being extremely low budget, is generous with the gore.  There are some faults to this movie though.  A major one being the cheesy 80&apos;s computer graphics added in on occasion to create that &quot;bad acid trip&quot; effect.  The creators also had a Texas Chainsaw fetish, as seen in the last few moments of the film. If you are into zombies, rednecks, hiking in cornfields, community theater, or moonshine. This may be the movie for you.  It delivers what it promises plain and simple."

But its wonderful, sentimental portrayal of a child&apos;s longing to be a great dancer has remained in my memory all these years. What&apos;s far more important, though, is that it captured fragments of dancing by the Royal Danish Ballet, one of the world&apos;s greatest companies, at one of their moments of glory (they&apos;re having another one now, in 2000!). Kirsten Simone, for example, was a little girl when the film was made and is now one of the company&apos;s greatest character dancers, still entrancing on stage as well as a dancer of the most impressive technical command. This film should be available to buy - ideally as a dvd, with a documentary, please. Disney, are you listening?",

      "reviewBody": "Given that I was the sole member of the audience at a 6pm screening in a usually well patronised Paris art house it may be fair to speculate that this movie has failed to find its audience. On the other hand it was released at the beginning of July and I saw it on September 2 so maybe it&apos;s just running out of steam.  The premise - if not the leading characters - is simple: As we establish a provincial town during an air raid and then what the French call an &apos;asile&apos; a caption sets the time: June, 1940.  The road running past the asile is up to its ass with vehicular and pedestrian traffic trying to outrun the Germans so it&apos;s not too difficult for Jean-Paul Leaud to open the gate and lead his family and friends to what passes for freedom at that time and place.  Sorry, but I for one have a problem with that; it SHOULD be difficult, dammit.  These are, after all, fruitcakes, or if you&apos;re PC they are being detained for their own and other&apos;s safety under the applicable mental health act, yet at no time does anyone attempt to follow them or bring them back.  Mental illness, of course, takes many forms and we get a fair sprinkling here from Leaud, who plays everything as if he&apos;d only just seen, fifty years too late, Joseph Wiseman in &apos;Detective Story&apos;, to Miou-Miou (who has no fewer than three new films on release in Paris) who does a beautiful job of passivity. One notable feature is the almost total lack of background music so that for long stretches we hear only natural sound. Ultimately it&apos;s a moving film in an unassuming way but animal lovers should beware the scene where Leaud beats a cow to death with a sledghammer.    8/10"

The trouble is, there is too much gore for kiddies, so definitely don&apos;t put this in your VCR for the toddlers. It starts off with a little bit of promise, giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover, but then descends quickly into epic stupidity. The &quot;killer scarecrows&quot; are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the Wizard of Oz, but not quite as smart. If they&apos;d only had a brain...? I got this movie for $1.20 at a local discount/close-out store and even so, I feel somewhat ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost three decades since starring in Juzo Itami&apos;s classic The Funeral, Tsutomu Yamazaki once more shines in a tale woven around the rituals, traditions and theatre involved in Japanese death rites. The irreverence that makes Itami&apos;s classic such a delight is present here. Daigo&apos;s first day on the job playing a stiff in a DVD for the funeral business comes back to haunt him in hilarious fashion later on. However, there is also reverence, the film respectfully pointing out that the people who do this necessary but thankless task do not deserve the disdain and revulsion that their profession often attracts.\n\nDaigo loses his job as a cellist, returns to his inaka roots and stumbles into a job as an undertaker. Too ashamed to tell his wife, he slowly warms to his apprenticeship under the masterful tutelage of Sasaki. As he goes about his business, the inevitable traumas of a childhood long forgotten bubble to the surface as he goes about re-acquainting himself with the town. The conduit for the negative feelings towards his profession is Daigo&apos;s wife Mika, who takes punitive steps on discovering his new employment.\n\nScreenwriter Kundo Koyama has to take credit for a script that moves along briskly, juxtaposing black farce with raw tenderness, all done seamlessly, and acutely observed. Lipstick on a corpse produces gales of laughter, and you are reminded that sometimes the best fun is had at funerals. Daigo moves towards a form of reconciliation and redemption through the promptings of those around him, and the comfort of his cello.\n\nIt would be all too easy for material like this to lurch into sappy sentimentality, but the film tugs at the heartstrings without overtly manipulating its audience. Motoki has to take some plaudits for this for a performance that amuses at times but hints at deep inner turmoil at others. Hirosue is less consistent, at times indulging in the head-bobbing, giggly, saccharine sweet girlishness that is the forte of the Japanese TV drama actress. She has one line in the climactic scene of such stunning obviousness I am surprised it stayed in, but for the most part she redeems herself in the tense interactions with Motoki over their differing views on his new career. Overall, she convinces as the supportive but put-upon wife.\n\nFrom Kurosawa&apos;s Ikiru through The Funeral and now Okuribito, Japanese cinema has a rich vein of movies that exploit the rituals of death. How those rituals comfort us, enchant us, and see us through to a place where the pain still exists but might come to an end, is laid bare in Okuribito. It is an absorbing, moving tale, full of laughter and tears, that celebrates the intricate details of a Japanese rites of passage while laying bare their universal function. Best seen in the cinema, to get the full effect of the luscious orchestral score.",

He then uses the car to become rich in order to win the heart of a girl, but becomes embroiled in a fiendish plot which could end up destroying Moscow!\n\nBlack Lightning is fun for kids of all ages, although the very young may not be able to keep up. If young children don&apos;t like the subtitles, the dubbing is pretty good, with annoying voices kept to a minimum. The performances are decent, the story is well paced and the action is interspersed at regular intervals throughout. Even if you don&apos;t become totally involved with the film, you can enjoy yourself spotting which script ideas have been taken from other films. SM",

      "reviewBody": "This is not a great film, but it is better than many critics said it was when the 1999 remake came out. THE END OF THE AFFAIR was one of the key novels of Graham Greene in the 1950s that delved into his intense Catholicism. \n\nWith a background of World War II, neighbors Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles (Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr) have a deep, passionate romance. But they are separated for a year or so, and when they try to resume the relationship (or when Johnson tries to resume the relationship - Kerr seems relatively hesitant). It turns out that, due to personal experiences, Kerr has had a religious revelation. She is listening to a Catholic priest. She is also trying to help a man with a deformity (a birthmark) on his face who hates God. She is also concerned about the spiritual health of Johnson and of her actual husband Henry (Peter Cushing, in a very moving - and non-horrific role). The film shows how Kerr affects all the lives around her, even beyond her death after a short illness (as the novel does). Yes, it is too talky - novels about ideas (and here it is the age old question of what is real love, the spiritual or the profane)usually are. Greene, good Catholic exponent that he was, would have said that Kerr&apos;s devotion to her God was an outpouring of divine true love to her fellow creatures. Her death is not a tragedy. But Greene the novelist and part-time realist cannot leave it there. Johnson&apos;s character is bitter at the end of this remarkable novel, and at the end of the film. And his bitterness is directed at the source of that love that triumphed over his profane one.",

Lighting and scenery are astonishingly crafted, wide-angle objectives, cranes and dollies are artfully used throughout the film making it look, despite of the poorly emulsified film (though not that bad for those times), like a highest-budget Hollywood movie. Photography direction and editing are also up to the highest notch! Direction and acting are great, no reason to praise anyone higher than the others (though my favourite is Nikolai Gritsenko as Alexander Alexandrovich Karenin). Truly a piece of a pure cinema art, absolutely creative, original and rich. Watch with pleasure.",

When he joins his first assignment is to kill Donald Bickhart, head of a biochemical company.  However when the First Lady is taken out by another assassin, Dunn finds himself set up as a patsy in a conspiracy that seeks to frame him and kill.  As Americas most wanted man he goes on the run to clear himself\n\nWritten and starring Wayans this has a bit of a vanity project about it. The story is ok at the most basic level - everyone likes a good conspiracy story and a good action movie.  However this has so many elements that are just plain daft.  One scene in particular - where Wayans is recognised on the street and is chased by about 600 people along a motorway, causing a major pileup, I assumed that this was a dream sequence if was so daft - but sadly it wasn&apos;t.  This is stretched out throughout the whole film in that whole scenes are daft - the main problem is that Dunn just walks into any building he wants unnoticed.  He gets past major security anywhere, he even gets into a high security military unit by hiding in the boot of a car.  You can see Wayans&apos; idea was good at the start but he doesn&apos;t know where to draw the line - the story is full of wish-fulfilment action scenes (jumping off a building with a parachute - without explaining how Americas most wanted got it from!).\n\nWayans is not great, he does OK at the start but his one-liners are weak and his performance as an unstoppable force towards the end doesn&apos;t set well with the story.  Voight is absolutely terrible, what was he thinking.  His character is full of stupid characteristics and never comes across as menacing or believable.  Paul Sorvino is OK as the FBI director, but with this and Knock Off, he must really wish that someone would make a Goodfellas 2!  Hennessey is ok as the only female role in the film, but she doesn&apos;t have much to do.  Eric Roberts wisely takes an un-credited role and does OK with it.  Robert Culp rounds out quite a famous cast - which is surprising when you consider the material.\n\nOverall this is enjoyable for the most part.  However most of it is daft and any clever bits are lost in a sea of stupidity.  5 out of 10 for effort."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Last Woman on Earth&quot; shows what happens as a romantic triangle plays out during an &quot;end of the world&quot; type of story. Harold Gern (Antony Carbone) is a shady banker enjoying the sights and sounds of Puerto Rico. Tagging along are his sexy young wife Evelyn (Betsy Jones- Moreland) and his loyal attorney Martin Joyce (future Oscar winning screenwriter Robert Towne, acting under the pseudonym Edward Wain). After a scuba diving excursion, they come out of the sea to find that some mysterious disaster has eliminated almost every living thing in sight. Harold is given to macho &quot;this is how it&apos;s gonna be&quot; proclamations, while Martin, who realizes that he&apos;s falling for Evelyn, acts as a voice of reason.\n\nTowne also wrote the screenplay for this one, his first. Since he worked slowly (according to producer &amp; director Roger Corman), his script was unfinished by the time of filming. So, in order to ensure that the screenwriter could be on set regularly, Corman convinced Towne to co-star in the film. Corman had come to Puerto Rico partly to take in the beauty of the surroundings, but largely due to &quot;certain tax laws&quot;. By the time he and his crew left the country, they had not one film under their belt, but three: this one, &quot;Creature from the Haunted Sea&quot; (a remake of &quot;Naked Paradise&quot;), and &quot;Battle of Blood Island&quot;.\n\nA great film this is not, but it&apos;s a passably engrossing one, thanks to some wonderful atmosphere (Corman actually ponied up the dough to shoot it in color) and Townes&apos; somewhat philosophical tale. There is some decent dialogue, good music by Ronald Stein, and effective cinematography by Jacques R. Marquette. The three cast members are reasonably good. Towne fares well enough, despite not being a professional actor.\n\nThe ending is abrupt, and may not be to all viewers&apos; satisfaction. Still, Corman and Towne deserve some credit for tackling the theme of the hostility and violence ingrained in mankind, on a rather meagre budget.\n\nSix out of 10.",

As it was done at RKO we have the Victor McLaglen/Preston Foster combination doing parts that fit O&apos;Brien and Cagney like a glove. \n\nThis was the kind of film that might have prospered better under John Ford. Ford had directed McLaglen and Foster in The Informer also for RKO, a film a lot more serious in subject matter.\n\nMcLaglen is playing cupid here. His daughter is Ida Lupino and he&apos;s a much decorated Chief Petty Officer in the Coast Guard. He&apos;s got both Preston Foster and Donald Woods courting her. Foster is cut a bit too much from the same cloth that produced McLaglen and he doesn&apos;t want to see Lupino end up with him. Vic much prefers Woods who is studying for officer candidate&apos;s school.\n\nMcLaglen abuses his rank to pick on Foster and finally Foster and he have it out. The only problem is that they tangle while on ice breaker duty and Woods is seriously injured while they&apos;re brawling. It results in court martial, but both get a chance to redeem themselves.\n\nSea Devils is not a bad film, but it feels like a bargain basement Cagney/O&apos;Brien or John Ford service comedy, a combination of both to be sure.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 1940s, Chester Morris and Tom Conway were reasonably successful and respected actors. Both made B series films (Boston Blackie and The Falcoh respectively) as well as A and B films...quite a few of them. But by the mid-1950s, both these actors were having problem finding roles on TV or films...and they were sadly reduced to acting in a schlocky film like this. Fortunately for Morris, he still had a few good projects in him (such as &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;) but Conway would soon become a pathetic guy without work, a home as well as broken health. A sad end for a very good actor.\n\nIn this film, Chester Morris plays Dr. Lombardi--a stage hypnotist with amazing powers. He is able to exert amazing power over people and claims to even be able to use age regression to bring out a physical manifestation...in essence, a monster. As for Conway, he plays Timothy Chappel, a guy who wants to exploit Lombardi&apos;s reputation in order to strike it rich. Little does he know that Lombardi&apos;s Svengali-like powers are real...and he&apos;s a very dangerous man. \n\nApart from looking at how beautiful Lombardi&apos;s muse (Marla English) is, there isn&apos;t a lot of positive things to say about this cheap film. The monster, in particular, is pretty comical looking...and instead of instilling fear in the audiences watching the movie, it likely just elicited laughter. Plus, nothing about this film even seems scary...just kind of silly.",

The plot is not the best at all but with his comedy talent he saves it to an upper level. There are some delicious scenes for example the one in the mayor&apos;s office where he gives us a view of his billiards play. Most other characters are not convincing although they try to do. If you concentrate you on the linguistic subtlety in some dialogues you will absolutely have fun."

He&apos;s sent by The Company to a heavily irradiated district called Oblivion following World War III to secure zirconium mining rights.\n\nBefriended by mutant heroine Clare Beresford, he gradually begins to identify with the downtrodden inhabitants of Oblivion. By film&apos;s end he has thrown in his lot with them and maneuvered it so the outside world won&apos;t exploit them overmuch.\n\nCorny pic involves a gladiatorial contest reminiscent of &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; but executed on a low budget. Film is far too tame for its target audience and has poor makeup effects, such as phony-looking false ears worn by the mutants.\n\nRambo&apos;s haircut is designed to remind us of Harrison Ford in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, but the resemblance ends there. Some or the local supporting cast is dubbed into English, which negates the impact of the villain played by Orlando Sacha."

      "name": "Relentlessly hilarious and outrageous musical  comedy that still works very  well",
      "reviewBody": "Amusing and entertaining Marx picture , it has a lot of funny material and unfortunately intrusive songs . Groucho&apos;s wisecracks and the incomparable Chico and Harpo carry the movie . It deals with a sly business manager named Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) and two (Chico Marx as Fiorello and Harpo Marx as Tomasso) wacky friends of two (Kitty Carlisle as Rosa and Allan Jones as Ricardo) opera singers help them achieve success while humiliating their stuffy and snobbish enemies . Later on , Marx Brothers anarchize the opera , insulting and mocking the guests and players . Their actions include some on stage antics during the stage debut , as they arrange for the normal tenor to be absent so that the young lover named Ricardo can get his chance . \n\nClassic Marx film with many funny sequences , this is the most sustained bit of insanity , full of crazy gags , antics and amusement , being now deemed a satiric masterpiece ,and one of the biggest hits . Although it suffers from staginess and musical comedy plotting but gives the zany threesome plenty of comic elaboration . Enough gags for give several movies , but our favorite is still the cabin scene . Despite the abundant songs and silly as well as sappy love story the movie maintains itself very well . This is a fun comedy as hilariously amusing as the films they made at Paramount with Zeppo . This is a M.G.M production lavishly financed by Irving Thalberg . Excellent Harpo Marx , as usual , he even did many of his own stunts , he later said it was a silly thing for a 47-year-old non-stuntman to have done . Groucho said that this was his favorite among his movies . The Marx Bros (minus Zeppo) are in peak form in this vintage musical comedy with co-star the legendary Margaret Dumont , including sparkling dialogs with Groucho . Furthermore , Sig Ruman makes his first of three appearances in The Marx Brothers films. However , this is the first Marx Brothers film made without brother Zeppo Marx, it started a new trend of The Marx Brothers movies featuring a Zeppo-like supporting character who carries the love story and sings the song . The motion picture was well directed by Sam Wood . Sam Wood, freshman The Marx Brothers director in this film, was a perfectionist , the scene in which Harpo Marx hangs from the rope was filmed so many times that Harpo Marx&apos;s hands became cut and swollen from the rope . Don&apos;t miss it , one of the funniest picture ever made by Marx Brothers\n\nOther important films starred by Marx Brothers -many of them Broadway farce plays transfered by scenarists into vehicle for the Brothres- , they are the followings : ¨Animal crackers¨, ¨Duck soap¨ that was a flop when first released but today considered a masterpiece , ¨Horse Feathers¨, ¨At the circus¨, ¨Day at the races¨ , ¨Room service¨ , ¨Go West¨, ¨Love Happy¨ and ¨Night in Casablanca¨, though in 1946 the Marx formula was wearing thin . Any film with Groucho , Chico , Harpo and Zeppo is well worth seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "For all the praise film-noir is lavished with (quite a lot of it  valid), the majority of it relies on convention as much as the standard white-picket-fence, happy-ending &apos;family&apos; film does: just invert the\n\ncliches and bathe them in deep-focus shadows. While this movie, on its surface, resembles the classic-style film noir of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, it&apos;s a whole different animal. No calculating evil females or tough guys masking hearts of gold populate IN A LONELY PLACE. It&apos;s a much more wrenching and powerfully disturbing film because the murder that draws the protagonists together turns out to be of peripheral importance, while the love story between Humphrey Bogart&apos;s troubled screenwriter and Gloria Grahame&apos;s B-actress spins inexorably towards damnation completely on its own power. The basic story has him a suspect in a killing and her in love with him yet unsure of his innocence, but director Nicholas Ray stages the proceedings so that WE see it&apos;s not the murder that disturbs her but her own conviction that his self-destructive and volatile nature will destroy them both. Yet, Ray never takes the easy way out of having Bogart turn monster on her. You care deeply about these people, hoping desperately (as Bogart&apos;s agent does in the film) that some transforming moment will come that will spare these people and allow their deeply felt love to flourish and heal them both, even as the evidence before your own eyes tells you there ain&apos;t no way. For 1950 -hell, for any year- such an unsentimental and uncompromising treatment of a tragic adult relationship is a terrible wonder to behold. The shadows suffusing this excellent film come not from UFA-influenced lighting but from moral and spiritual desolation, the death throes of old Hollywood, the coming of McCarthyism and the Black Dahlia murder of 1947. But most of all, they&apos;re projected from within the characters themselves. The finest work of Bogart, Grahame and Ray. Special note should be taken of Ray and Grahame, whose own deteriorating relationship formed the template for the doomed lovers; for them, this film is an act of great courage. Bogart himself has taken elements of all his previous romantic loners  and blended them with the sour pigments of Fred C Dobbs; as the star and executive producer, his performance is unflinching in its honesty, and as fearless as Grahame and Ray. See this movie."

      "reviewBody": "If you read my review of this one from August of 99, then you have my opinion after watching only once and being disappointed by its comparisons to Dazed &amp; Confused.  The fact is-- after I rented it, I thought of this movie often.  I thought of some of the funny lines, but mainly it was thought provoking in a sense; as though it worked on a deeper level than it was meant to deliver on.  The characters were somehow very believable and the situations, though far fetched in a movie way, really reminded me of being there years ago.  For example, while Joe&apos;s ramblings are misguided and nonsensical, it was evident that he had higher aspirations.  His dialogue was like how a kid like that might talk in real life-- not like someone reading from a script might.  Hubbs and Tack were classic movie characters, as well.\n\nUnable to get the film out of my head, I decided I had to own it.  I ordered a copy and watch it about once a month or so, howling with laughter each time.  My point is that my initial impression was not nearly as favorable as it is now, partly based on certain expectations.  If you realize from the outset that you&apos;re watching a B-movie and just enjoy it for what it is, you may find the hidden gem that I found.",

The great action scenes, great story telling, superb acting, fabulous art direction and amazing camerawork hold it up just as well today as in 1926.\n\nNow, I&apos;m not a fan of sweeping epics.  I, for one, hate David Lean&apos;s work with a passion.  But in the silent days, many a great epic film was made, and this in one of them.\n\nProbably the most incredible thing is the sheer size of this movie. The opening scenes of the french troops advancing toward the fort, or later with the arabs doing the same thing, are astounding. Unlike in Lean&apos;s work, where crowds of chattering background players rush about in every direction, director Herbert Brennon skillfully weaves his literal army of extras over the sand dunes, obviously going to great lengths to ensure that he gets a breathtaking shot.  And cinematographer Roy Hunt captures it impeccably, only as an artist would.  I&apos;d like to see more of his.\n\nI saw this movie last night in a restored silent movie theater with live organ accompaniment.  The organist, the incredible Dennis James, mentioned that some audience members might feel that they had seen this film before, only that they thought that it was with Gar Cooper.  I haven&apos;t seen that version, but apparently it&apos;s almost a shot-for-shot remake.  I&apos;d love to see it if it&apos;s even half as good as this one.",

      "reviewBody": "This clever and successful Spaghetti Western that owes a considerable debt to Leone deals with a miserable young named Scott (Giuliano Gemma) who runs errands and works menial jobs in a little town ; as he&apos;s harassed , pushed and kicked by ruthless villagers . Then , there arrives an occasional mysterious visitor , a too smart bad guy , he&apos;s a two-fisted gunslinger named Frank (Lee Van Cleef) . He befriends Scott and acts as protector of the humiliated young who receives advice from the gunslinger and he becomes tough , surpassing his teacher . The gunfighter teams up with the hapless young man against the nasty townspeople mistreated him and then Scott carries out a personal vendetta . Later on , fateful happenings takes place , as they never thought it could happen in their town .\n\nThe film displays psychological characters-in deep , shootouts , Western action and being entertaining enough . The movie contains typical particularities Spaghetti , as it is filled with fury , sadism , bloodbaths , and portentous close-ups of grime-encrusted faces . Gulianno Gemma is good as unfortunate guy working in worst and dirtiest labors , and Lee van Cleef is cool as cruel gunslinger . As secondaries appear Jose Calvo (Silvanito in &apos; A fistful of dollars&apos;) and Spaghetti regulars as Benito Stefanelli (habitual master of arms) , Andrea Bosic and Ricardo Palacios . Furthermore , Ivonne Sanson as brothel Madame , she was a known actress in Italian melodramas and an uncredited Al Mulock (he was one of the mythic trio at the beginning of &apos;One upon a time in the West&apos; along with Jack Elam and Woody Strode) . The producers Alfonso Sansone and Chroscicki produced &apos;Day of Anger&apos; with quite a few budget . The picture is full of nice sound by composer Riz Ortalani and colorfully photographed by cameraman Enzo Sarafian . The motion picture was well directed by Tonino Valeri who was Sergio Leone&apos;s assistant . Valeri managed to make a fluid , witty and agreeable SW . He proved his experience in Western , such as : ¨Bounty hunter¨ , ¨Death a President¨ , ¨A reason to live a reason to die¨ and his biggest hit : ¨My name is nobody¨ with Henry Fonda and Terence Hill .\n\nThis Spaghetti Western I giorni dell&apos;ira (1967) along with &apos;Da Uomo a Uomo (Giulio Petroni with Lee Van Cleef-John Philip Law)&apos; led to recovery in the popularity of &apos;horse opera&apos; after Leone hits . Both of them are masterpieces about gunslinger/disciple theme , and developing a paternal-filial relationship . Other films about this matter is as follows : &apos;All&apos;ombra di un colt (65)&apos; by Gianni Grimaldi with Conrado San Martin and Stephen Forsyth , &apos;Bandits (1967)&apos; by Massimo Dallamano with Enrico Maria Salerno and Venantino Venantini and &apos;Beyond the Law (68)&apos; by Giorgio Stegani with Lee Van Cleef and Alfonso Sabato.",

      "reviewBody": "Blu Gang e vissero per sempre felici e ammazzati (The Short and Happy Life of the Brothers Blue) is directed by Marc Meyer (AKA: Luigi Bazzoni) and written by Augusto Caminito. It stars Guido Mannari, Tina Aumont, Antonio Falsi, Jack Palance, Maurizio Bonuglia, Paul Jabara and Guido Lollobrigida. Filmed in Technospes Color, with music by Tony Renis and cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. \n\nDetermined bank guard Hillman (Palance) pursues the bank robbing Brothers Blue across the years as they make merry hell with care free abandon. \n\nStrange Spaghetti Western that takes Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, sprinkles in some Bonnie and Clyde seasoning and finally dresses it up with a Peckinpah and Altman sauce. For the most part it struggles to make all the parts work, where quite often director Bazzoni gets confused as to just what sort of film he is making. However, some of the visual flourishes are worth the time spent with the movie, be it the shifts into black and white for reflective passages of the gang&apos;s life, or the use of slow motion and angled techniques, it&apos;s a picture not without technical merit. \n\nIt also features violence that hits the right notes by not being over grandiose and ridiculous, the makers clearly aiming for, and getting, a balletic quality to the carnage as the corruption and arrogance of youth in the Wild West is laid bare. Renis&apos; musical score is, different, but pleasing, and the cast perform adequately as per the screenplay. Palance, it should be noted, is more a peripheral character, he&apos;s the cool looking sniper adorned ghost out in the wilderness hunting his prey, his dialogue and screen time minimal, so fans of his should not expect a &quot;Palance&quot; movie. \n\nFascinating Spaghetti Western that nods to its American Revisionist cousins, but ultimately it bites off more than it can chew. 6/10",

He meets art gallery owner Sarah Barton (Teresa Palmer).\n\nThere is a good idea somewhere here and these actors could have made it work. I&apos;m still not sure if this premise makes any kind of movie sense. It would probably make more sense without the complication of the past loop. It could be more compelling. I really like the beautiful looking couple although they could have some better writing. The movie just needs to clear up the rambling premise.",

Even the kids were great and believable as the characters.\n\nAnd yea, I doubt this would happen the way it did in real life, but isn&apos;t the point of making movies is to step away from reality for a few hours? If you wanna see something sad, something real, something about love, something about trust, something about sacrifice and something about family...then this is your movie. Don&apos;t expect perfection but it comes close enough...\n\n.....\n\nA mother is the truest friend we have, when trials heavy and sudden, fall upon us; when adversity takes the place of prosperity; when friends who rejoice with us in our sunshine desert us; when trouble thickens around us, still will she cling to us, and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness, and cause peace to return to our hearts. ~Washington Irving",

      "reviewBody": "According to a list compiled by IMDb, hardly 10 of the 81 most significant changes in actors&apos; looks in popular cinema have been by women. Namely, Natalie Portman, Nicole Kidman, Ellyn Burstyn, Demi Moore, Charlize Theron, Helena Bohman Carter, Emma Thompson, Hillary Swank, and Cameron Diaz. They have shaved their hair, chapped, freckled and scorched their skin, put on weight, all to literally get into the skin of their characters and made themselves look (conventionally) less attractive. The latest addition to them all comes from unexpected quarters. Bollywood, infamous for it&apos;s assembly line that boxes glamor dolls into arm candy roles, observes Isha Koppikhar in a new avatar called Shabri. Inspired by a true story, she sheds her graces to acquire the looks of a slum dweller that evolves into a legendary gangster. \n\nShabri&apos;s story narrates a greater phenomenon in turbulent times, the rise of female criminality. Westernization and industrialization have driven the traditional woman from the domestic space to the productive job sector, (as Shabri runs a flour mill). Added responsibilities, stress and failure to attain their socially defined goals drive frustration and pave the ways of their families into crime. The entry of Shabri represents and strikingly resonates with this rising demographic. She rises from the ashes of poverty forced by survival to climb into the snake pit of political power in the Mumbai underworld.\n\nThe meticulous eyes of Lalit Marathe cover every clinical aspect, be it the sewed shreds on her blouse, or her brother stealing her slippers because his own pair is torn and they can&apos;t afford new ones. The camera shots and angles are absolutely novel and brilliant. They show the characters in poignant frames and settings, putting together nothing less than a work of art. Simple objects like a dead tree branch, a window or a balcony are used as props and benchmarks to express the moods of the characters. Feels like the arrival of Louvre in the Mumbai underworld. \n\nThroughout the film, Shabri&apos;s presence is more powerful than words, her silence more deafening than screams. As she rests her head on a brick wall while mourning the loss of a loved one, and as her tearful eyes look up in a slant to her captor that takes her home, grief gives way to fury. The supporting cast plays their part just right, with the finesse and the pace that fits the mood of the film. The villain&apos;s character is especially well developed, as he depicts a variety of emotions, not just negative tones, leading him to become one more of the characters in the film rather than just a bad guy. Shabri&apos;s relationship with Murad is very well distanced, as well as crafted. Their platonic coexistence has romantic roots, but ones that remain unspoken of. There are many tender moments in the film where bringing closure to the scene would set the film on the path of a commercial potboiler. However as a maestro would, the director holds back, allowing the viewer&apos;s imagination to execute the task. \n\nA fascinating character in the film is Inspector Quazi. Various psychology theories suggest that one of the deepest roots to human motivation is that of seeking stimulation, and Quazi fits it perfectly. A man of outstanding capabilities who is bored with the mundane routine of his job, he strives to reinvent his job such that he may be amused and entertained. He lives his life with the pursuit of unleashing chaos, aspiring to keep the reins of all the players of the game in his own hands. What sets this movie a class apart is that the brutality and action is not driven to over kill. It makes a gritty as well as a crisp viewing experience. There isn&apos;t an abundance or overflow of blood, nor any loudness in the expressions of those in it. Fights are swift and real, not orchestrated, nor elaborate. The colors are faded and blood is dark red, not vermilion. Gunshots are snappy, and deaths of important characters devoid of melodrama. From the waters lapping against the shore at low tide at the docks, to the hand rubbed polish on Rawat&apos;s vintage Jaguar, Shabri is a vividly constructed original script as well as a well narrated tale. Unlike many others, it does not end where the audience starts to leave the theater. It ties up the loose ends, relates to how life proceeds for each of the significant characters, and how the dark night gives way to dawn. The aftertaste it leaves behind is not necessarily sweet, but one that perfectly whets the viewers&apos; appetite.\n\nThe action role in a Saree also makes Shabri a cultural icon. Since gender equality and feminist themes in media originated in western nations, most action roles enacted by women in Bollywood have been in western attires (with the added flexibility in physical movement). But unlike the many who dress as Lara Croft to depict an action performance, Shabri kicks, shoots, jumps, and runs in a tattered Saree. Being the first female actor that embraces her action role with an Indian identity, she doesn&apos;t imitate a fighting man. She&apos;s a woman that fights as herself. \n\nWith this performance, Isha Koppikhar challenges the corridors of power in Bollywood just as the fictitious Shabri does to her male counterparts. In a land where men pursue fair and handsome and women&apos;s dowry rates correlate with the sales of fair and lovely creams, she displays the courage to add more layers of darkness to her complexion. She could evoke mourning for the demise of porcelain beauty, or celebrations for the arrival of character and essence in a woman. But her charms invade our senses as the touch of raindrops on a heated brick wall. Unnerving, yet soothing and memorable.",

The first, &apos;The Tide&apos;, is set in the present day, and concerns a student and his young female cousin stranded on the beach by the tide, secluded from prying eyes. &apos;Therese Philosophe&apos; is set in the nineteenth century, and concerns a girl being locked in her bedroom, where she contemplates the erotic potential of the objects contained within it. &apos;Erzsebet Bathory&apos; is a portrait of the sixteenth-century countess who allegedly bathed in the blood of virgins, while &apos;Lucrezia Borgia&apos; concerns an incestuous fifteenth-century orgy involving Lucrezia, her brother, and her father the Pope.\n\nSuch a crazy film. From the very plot synopsis, you might think this was something like Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Everything You Wanted To Know&quot;. I mean, heck, these are vignettes about unusual sexual practices, right? But the intent is clearly different. Allen was being funny and not all that risqué.\n\nThis film, on the other hand, has almost no humor and seems to be made for one purpose: to put as many nude women in one film as humanly possible. Granted, it is still a good film in some ways and has an artistic merit. It is not pornographic. But seeing as a similar film could have been made with only a fraction of the nudity, it is clear what the intention was.",

      "reviewBody": "The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988)\n\nI liked this book a lot, and I like director Philip Kaufman&apos;s approach to movies. The best of this movie is terrific, as well: the wild culture of personal and cultural freedom at the start, the chilling invasion of Soviet tanks in the center, and the last half hour of idealized romance and happiness in the country.\n\nThat kind of gives away the movie, it would seem. But in a way, the movie is about how all these things happen. This is where it gets to be about taste and patience. It&apos;s a long movie, and much of the events are not really a development of plot, but a steady continuation of a variety of relationships (mainly between the lead man and the two main women). There is a plot behind all this, especially around their leaving Czechoslovakia and then finding a return to bliss in the Czech countryside, but this doesn&apos;t drive the movie overall.\n\nFor me, it wasn&apos;t enough to see these people enjoying sex and discovering conflicts between the three legs of the love triangle. Scenes were often leisurely in a way that implies we were glad to just be there and watch things happen within a pocket of frozen time, rather than through time. By that I mean, it wasn&apos;t where you were going with the emotional aspects, but it was where you were, the now of the interactions. The might actually be where the book was so successful--it created moods and scenes where you were, actually, glad to just be absorbed. For me, that wasn&apos;t always the case in the film version.\n\nPart of the problem might just be Daniel Day Lewis, who is a bit too self-satisfied, not as a character (that is certain) but as an actor. He lacks the magnetism that might sustain the unlikely and ongoing love the two women have for him, even as they know about each other. On the other hand, it&apos;s a huge, epic tale about true freedom, and a very real pursuit of happiness. And when the energy gets going, and the mood is fully expanded, there is magic. Especially, again, at the end, including the famous fade to white in the last frames, it is about a kind of heaven on earth. Who can object to that?",

Not least Guste&apos;s realisation that working in a munitions factory while her husband was at war was contributing to the profits of the munition makers. However, she was lucky that her husband survived the Great War. The German hyper-inflation in the twenties was cursorily dealt with, possibly because of its contribution to the rise of the NSDAP. This was insidiously treat: the realisation that nasty things were happening: speaking out becoming dangerous, the way the Jewish family next door suddenly vanishing, the reaction to Guste&apos;s attempts to stop their possessions being sold: &quot;They won&apos;t be coming back.&quot; The sets and settings were well done, not least the interiors of the rich houses and those of the poor. Notable moments were the troops singing the Horst Wessell Lied, the Head teacher shouting &quot;This is a Prussian school!&quot; when Guste asks if anything can be done to ensure children have breakfast before they come to school, the nice doctor treating Guste&apos;s dying husband who turns nasty when she expresses Social Democratic views, and Guste&apos;s reaction when told her one of her children and two grandchildren were not burnt to death in an air-raid but drowned in their cellar when a water-main broke. (As an aside, I think the short clip of bombs being dropped from plane did not show an Allied plane.",

      "reviewBody": "While Tod Browning&apos;s Dracula is not the definitive take on the most famous vampire of all time, it is possibly the most memorable one. This is not due to Browning&apos;s technical achievements or directorial wizardry, by ANY means. It is due to Bela Lugosi&apos;s career-defining portrayal of the title character. Born in what is now Lugoj, Romania, Lugosi brings to the part the flavor of his homeland, making him more believable as Dracula. This other-worldly aesthetic helped to make his performance what many consider the ultimate incarnation of Stoker&apos;s Dracula. Having played the Count in Hamilton Deane&apos;s Broadway version of Dracula, which started in 1927, Bela Lugosi was more than prepared for the role when it was time to commit it to film. Still struggling with the English language, however, he had to learn his lines phonetically. European accent in tact, he was able to deliver such memorable lines as, &quot;I bid you welcome,&quot; &quot;Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make,&quot; and, of course, &quot;I am Dracula.&quot; His performance alone is reason enough to watch this monster movie classic. If only the rest of the film was as spectacular as Lugosi. Dwight Frye&apos;s Renfield, while perhaps a little too over-the-top, is still another highlight to the film, and even Edward Van Sloan&apos;s Van Helsing is enough to challenge the might of Count Dracula. The rest of the film is rather flat to me. Now, I know it was made in 1931, and that, at the time, it horrified audiences, but I still stand by my opinion that the overall movie pales in comparison to Bela Lugosi&apos;s performance. Everyone else just seemed to be going through the motions, and it seems especially evident while Helen Chandler and David Manners are on screen. They just aren&apos;t convincing. I&apos;m not saying that their performances ruin the film. It is still a classic, and certainly worth a viewing, but if you are in the mood for a vampire movie that is worthy of Bram Stoker&apos;s name, look no further than F. W. Murnau&apos;s Nosferatu. It is much more convincing and even scarier than Tod Browning&apos;s Dracula, despite being nine years older and silent. All in all, though, one cannot overlook the stellar performance of Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!",

Throw in a creative concept involving bone-sucking organisms, who leave some icky effects behind. Cup of chick noodle soup anyone? These nasty creatures (silicates) looked less than threatening in appearance and let out one eerie slurping noise (straw sound fx?), even though some of the attack scenes were in slow-motion (they move real slowly) and daftly pitched (tree dropping). However sometimes it manages to be uncanny, other times silly developments occur, but the danger is always felt. This leads to a couple of intense and surprisingly brutal moments. The choice of location (island) adds to the atmosphere and isolation. At best, a fun low-budget fare.",

Did you expect them to gush about a female&apos;s personality to his fellows in the late &apos;50s???????\n\nSee how guys even refer to Carol Heathrow as &quot;death&quot;. Women are not to be understood and to be feared.\n\nAnd the reason we never see Eddie&apos;s bride....think about it,,,if you SAW her, you&apos;d make a judgement about that actress. &quot;Wow, how could a guy pass her up just because she doesn&apos;t know more about football?&quot; That&apos;s the reason we never see her. We must only know that Eddie loves her but is scared to marry her for various reasons. The moment we saw her face, there would be too many value judgements about whether Eddie is nuts to make her take the test. For thodse who complained about her face not being shown, ask yourself if it would  have tainted your opinion of Eddie&apos;s requirement for marriage.\n\nSure, the movie doesn&apos;t SEEM like it has a plot. But it&apos;s just a slice of life in 1959, the week between Christmas and New Year&apos;s Eve....and we share that week."

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Alexander the Great",
      "reviewBody": "I borrowed this movie with one intent, and that is to see how the subject material was handled in the 50s, compared to the most recent interpretation by Oliver Stone, who gave us an Alexander with Colin Farrell complete with his hair dyed blonde. And while I was lamenting the fact that there were only 2 war scenes on a massive scale included in that version, the hype that surrounded the story of a conqueror seemed to have made way for Stone&apos;s very queer depiction on the bisexuality of Alexander, especially with the camera adopting his POV and gazing ever so lovingly at the male species, countless of times until you want to throw up. I guess subtle is never in Stone&apos;s books.\n\nNow this version written and directed by Robert Rossen (who also gave us the original Hustler) did away with all that sexuality issues, and neither did it find any need to have gratuitous nudity in watching Alexander make love (in Stone&apos;s version, Rosario Dawson went nude in her role as Roxane). Then again it was made about 50 years ago. Anyway, what I found to be a major disappointment, were the battle scenes. Yes, it might be terribly dated by now, and sadly didn&apos;t survive the test of time. At certain scenes and angles, it&apos;s akin to old martial arts movies, where enemies just circle around you, waiting for their choreographed moves to be executed, or worse, if you pay attention to characters in the background, they surely aren&apos;t moving like ferocious warriors, choosing instead to mull around!\n\nAlso, we only get one major battle sequence in Alexander the Great, which made the foray into India in Stone&apos;s Alexander look like bonus material. In fact, this version took some time to establish key characters, and began with Alexander&apos;s father King Philip&apos;s (Fredric March) conquests first, interrupted by the birth of his son, and the prophetic signs under which he was born. It took almost 30 minutes before you see any semblance to a fight, and almost one hour before Richard Burton finally takes over the mantle and seeks out his destiny as one of the greatest known world conquerors of all time. However, the film felt like it was in two arcs, the first which dwells on the internal bickering within Greece with its many factions, and the plotting between mother Olympias (Danielle Darrieux) and King Philip, each wanting to win over Alexander&apos;s loyalty for their own political purpose. In this version though, which harped on Darrieux&apos;s appearance in the credits, I thought she made Angelina Jolie look more formidable in the role. At least Jolie was dripping with evilness and cunning, compared to the more subdued Darrieux.\n\nThe latter half dealt with Alexander&apos;s conquests through Asia, though most of the facts were glossed over. It was too little too late as most of which are told using montage, intertitles and narration, which made it look like a rush job to end it. While Stone&apos;s movie had focused a fair bit over Alexander&apos;s obsession with being the Son of God and his increasing obsession over himself and his glories, this version again made those themes look superbly examined in Stone&apos;s version. However, one thing&apos;s for certain, Richard Burton, even with the horribly blond hair which looked like a wig, was indeed a lot more charismatic and believable than Coliln Farrell. And that also meant when Burton was wearing the horrendous full faced helmet so that the stunt guy can take over!\n\nAll in all, a pretty decent effort in telling the story of Alexander the Great, however as mentioned, it didn&apos;t really stood up to the test of time.",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t know but I am not surprised to learn that over 40 hours of footage was shot in the making of this movie. Virtually any kind of movie can be made with that much material to work with. Screwball Comedy, Dark Comedy, Light Drama, Melodrama even Horror. It all depends how you edit it. Kind of like the manufactured plots in reality tv shows. It&apos;s all down to editing\n\nWhat you get here is something that is sort of like a precursor to Wicker Man but in another part of the world and with different results. Locals mimic the making of a Western that was just shot in a strange ritualistic way. How we get to that point is a bit of a surprise because much of the story seems to be about one of the stars of the western staying on the location to settle with a local woman and discover gold mines. Then comes the bamboo film equipment.\n\nIf the goal was surrealism, Hopper nails it. If the goal was to be anything else specifically speaking, then that&apos;s still unclear. I was interested enough to keep watching and was surprised with how things shifted. The ending felt a little open ended. I can&apos;t call this a great movie but it has alot in it for me to want to revisit it and make more sense of it or a different sort of sense of it. Maybe my interpretation was a little off. Visually, it is fantastic. Peru is a genuinely beautiful country and very well captured here.",

      "reviewBody": "To review &quot;D-War&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Dragon Wars&quot; or &quot;Dragon Wars: D-War&quot;) with any real depth would be an exercise in utter futility. I mean that, really. The film is a big, loud special effects bonanza the likes of which have been seen plenty of times on United States soil, but &quot;D-War&quot; is unique in the fact that it is not an American production, but an Asian one, specifically of the South Korean kind.\n\nBut just because it&apos;s a South Korean movie with American actors, does that really make it good? It&apos;s a yes/no/maybe so type of answer. &quot;D-War&quot; comes to us from South Korean import Hyung-rae Shim, who announced the project back in 2002 and has spent the last five years getting it off the ground. It&apos;s received mostly negative reviews here in the U.S. and in South Korea (where it set box office records for an opening week with an estimated five million viewers within a nine-day time-span), but the movie&apos;s special effects and action sequences are undeniably stunning. But it&apos;s a shame about the story and characters.\n\nSupposedly based on an ancient Korean legend, a 200-meter-long Imoogi (a giant serpent) called Buraki is denied a chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined to perform the ceremonial rights run away and perish in their escape. 500 years later in Los Angeles, the man is reincarnated as American news reporter Ethan (Jason Behr), who as a child was given a powerful pendant by an elderly antiques dealer named Jack (Robert Forster) and now has to find the reincarnated woman, Sarah (Amanda Brooks), before her 20th birthday.\n\nSure enough, in special effects sequences that seem right out of any Asian monster flick made in the last 50 years, the dragon Buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army of demonic warriors to continue his 500-year pursuit of what is rightfully his. Lots of explosions, guns, and destruction as ancient slams head-on into 21st-century military technology, and Ethan and Sarah try to find a way to stop Buraki and his army before he destroys the city.\n\n&quot;D-War&quot; is a film that looks and sounds amazing, in theory, but the execution is so poor that you&apos;ll rightfully feel that you&apos;ve been cheated by the time the credits roll. Make no mistake, Buraki and his minions look pretty cool and plenty menacing, and the destruction they bring about in their action sequences is nothing short of breathtaking. In this regard, Shim has surely done his job in presenting &quot;D-War&quot; as a no-holds-barred sci-fi/fantasy action epic.\n\nOn the other hand, the film&apos;s human players are drastically short-changed and given cheap, hokey dialogue and scenes that rarely connect. It seems that the only reason they&apos;re here is to give us something to root for, which is not in any real way genuine. &quot;D-War&quot; unfortunately comes off as something a lot closer to the poor American adaptation &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998) than anything that is uniquely Korean. Another problem is that the story seems to take itself a little too seriously, with cheap humor that doesn&apos;t get anything greater from us than a weak little laugh. The acting and direction seem mediocre at best (so that you do feel a little sorry for the hokey performances of American heavyweight Robert Forster and up-and-coming Jason Behr), which is a real shame because Hyung-rae Shim is obviously a capable talent who knew what he wanted to do here and surely enough had the means to do it. His head seems full of ideas but the problem is with the execution of those ideas; maybe he was trying to do too much without really working out the material in greater detail. And the ending, a would-be &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; special effects showdown, seems pretty cheap too.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, believe me, but &quot;D-War&quot; is a mediocre attempt at something that really had potential to be spectacular. But maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m an American. Maybe you&apos;d have to be Korean to understand the mythical themes about that classic battle between good and evil. It&apos;s just too bad that the finished product of &quot;D-War&quot; appears to be like any other &quot;B&quot;-grade monster movie than the extraordinary idea that the director had in mind.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Maybe it&apos;s me; maybe I&apos;m getting old But yet again a supposedly clever, intelligent, smart movie about relationships and life has let me down. This is another one I missed at the theatre release but caught up with on DVD, only to end up yawning and wishing I hadn&apos;t bothered. Well, perhaps that&apos;s an exaggeration, I won&apos;t go that far. It&apos;s always interesting to watch a new movie, especially one you have specifically sought out, as I did Broken Flowers. But when it finished my response was a shrug of &quot;So what?&quot; And it co-starred one of my favorite actors too, the quite wonderful Jeffrey Wright (who was so superb in Angels in America) as Winston, which to me was an extra incentive to watch this. But even Wright failed to engage me this time. Perhaps that sums up my entire response to the film  it never fully engaged me.\n\nBill Murray is an interesting guy, I enjoyed Ground Hog Day and I thought Lost in Translation very good. Even that supposed oceanography saga from a couple of years back was mildly entertaining (if only because I spent 7 years at sea on ocean survey ships and could giggle at how ludicrous the story was). But I&apos;m beginning to get the feeling when I see Bill Murray on screen these days, that he&apos;s basically playing Bill Murray. That bemused, ironic guy, been everywhere, done everything, &quot;I&apos;m just a helpless passenger on the train of life&quot; act, is wearing thin for me. I want to see him play a serial killer or a gay tap dancer. Not another middle aged Lothario.\n\nDon Johnston (Murray) has just split up with another woman (an occurrence which seems to fill him with nothing more than apathy), when he receives a mysterious pink, girly letter in the mail, suggesting that he has a 19 year old son. Narrowing the mother down to a field of 4 potential brood mares, he is egged on by his neighbor Winston (Wright) to tour some of his old haunts looking for his son, the mother and perhaps his own life too.\n\nWinston apparently fixes this trip up for Don, an act of altruism I found more than a little unlikely, and Don obediently does what he&apos;s told and trots off on his journey of discovery. Yes he&apos;s lived a fairly self centered life, yes he&apos;s failed to sustain a long term relationship. Am I supposed to feel sorry for him, or learn something appropriate about my own existence from this? Hell, the guy has a beautiful house, apparently lots of money (he can travel where and when he wants), a string of good looking sex partners and what looks like a pretty pleasant life. Watching this after a long and tedious week at work and chasing round after my own two kids, I envied the guy! Don&apos;t mess it up Don! Trash the letter and stay home! You&apos;re doing just fine the way you are The film puzzled me, because I couldn&apos;t decide whether we were supposed to take it at face value  Winston really does fix up trip and Don really can just up sticks and go at a moment&apos;s notice  or whether there is supposed to be an element of magic here and it&apos;s really just a fairy tale. Which is possible, but either way I didn&apos;t really care much. Maybe I&apos;m not intelligent enough to &quot;get it?&quot; One bright spot was the quite delightful naked Lolita, and Sharon Stone was good value too. Oh how I wanted to Don to engage in some reckless and possibly illegal fun with Lolita while mother cooked dinner, but he was too apathetic to even do that! The dialogue was all unreal and the outcome fairly unexciting.\n\nIf this was intended to be some kind of life lesson for us lesser mortals, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m just too bitter and twisted to appreciate it. Dull. Again. Oh dear."

      "reviewBody": "This popular French comedy deservedly received a lot of international acclaim and awards on its original release and still pleases when watched today almost 40 years later; apart from the Cesars and the Golden Globes, the film received 3 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Film (which it lost to Ivory Coast&apos;s BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR – which I also caught up with just now), Best Actress (Marie-Christine Barrault losing out to NETWORK&apos;s Faye Dunaway) and Best Original Screenplay (again won by NETWORK). Interestingly enough, in both the Actress and Screenplay categories, there were two foreign nominees apiece: Barrault and Liv Ullman in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s FACE TO FACE and, for Screenplay, Lina Wertmuller&apos;s SEVEN BEAUTIES and, incidentally, both directors made the cut among the final 5 nominees for Best Direction! \n\nBarrault and her female co-star Marie-France Pisier (a Cesar winner herself here and, for my money, more deserving of an Oscar nod than the latter) are the only familiar names in a sympathetic cast; even director Tacchella seems to have been a one-hit wonder. Bafflingly, COUSIN COUSINE had been &apos;announced&apos; as an upcoming Criterion title since the earliest days of DVD (in fact, the copy I watched culled from a US TV screening sports the tell-tale &quot;Janus Film&quot; header before the film&apos;s opening credits) but this release never came to pass! For what it is worth, this is one of the earliest examples of a Gallic success being revamped for Hollywood consumption, when it was remade by Joel Schumacher as COUSINS (1989) with Ted Danson, Isabella Rossellini and Sean Young.\n\nIn any case, the plot line is simple enough: an extended family is reunited for two weddings and a funeral (anticipating the popular 1994 British farce FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL by 20 years!) and a series of infidelities come to the fore between two particular couples. Barrault&apos;s chronically womanizing husband (Guy Marchand) had been cheating on her with (among many others) the vulnerable Pisier, whose own restless spouse (Victor Lanoux) starts an initially secretly platonic but subsequently openly passionate affair with Barrault. There are several memorably delightful episodes which add to the charm of the film: during the wedding reception of Barrault&apos;s mother, the groom proposes to sing but when vetoed, proceeds to indulge in &quot;mooning&quot; (baring his buttocks in public); when Marchand decides after the opening wedding ceremony to mend his philandering ways, he is shown running from one flame to the next to end their relationship...ultimately being thrown off a bus by the burly female driver!; at the second marriage, Marchand again keeps getting into fisticuffs with the bridegroom&apos;s father, a former business partner who had defrauded him, etc. The whole is set to a jaunty musical accompaniment courtesy of yet another obscure element, one Gerard Anfosso.",

Not only is this a bizarre world but seems to be playing games with time and history, the communist East Germany being portrayed as a kind of war time Nazi set-up!\n\nKilmer does well with an impossible role to the point where you wonder if he didn&apos;t miss his vocation. He can sing and dance better than many real singers and he proved in The Doors that he is really a major musical  force. Strangely it is rumoured that he didn&apos;t realise this was a satire!\n\nThe stupidity of many Elvis movies and those Saturday morning children&apos;s reels (scientist and beautiful daughter) are taken to the cleaners and you have fantastic sight gags. The &quot;falling guard&quot; gag is one of the best sight gags in the history of movies - I challenge anyone not to laugh at it.\n\nI enjoy a stupid movie every now and then and admit I enjoyed this one. Clearly the authors know little about German history or  European culture and the little they do know seems cribbed from watching bad B movies on the subject, but what the hell. This is too stupid for anyone to get seriously uptight about. &quot;How silly can you get?&quot; sings Kilmer at one point in the film: Maybe a little, but not that much!",

      "reviewBody": "La Damigella Di Bard is of interest as an example of a period melodrama current at the time in 1930s Italy and as a vehicle for the popular veteran actress Emma Gramatica, whose career spanned almost five decades.(She is known to US audiences most likely as the old lady who finds the baby in a cabbage patch in De Sica&apos;s Miracle In Milan) The film was released in the US under the title Il Destino, which IMDb mistakenly lists as a separate movie. (Variety&apos;s reviewer complained there was too much dialogue.) The role of the aging but now financially challenged countess is perfect for Gramatica, who shows vulnerability (her furniture is taken away) stubbornness (refusing to help a researcher with old letters) nostalgia (flashbacks to her youth) and finally excitement (finding the long lost boy she thinks is her murdered brother&apos;s son.)",

      "reviewBody": "Be it Sabina in w-d Cristina Comencini&apos;s &quot;La Bestia Nel Cuore&quot; 2005, or Giovanna in w-d Ferzan Ozpetek&apos;s &quot;La Finestra Di Fronte&quot; 2003, or Giulia in w-d Gabriele Muccino&apos;s &quot;L&apos;Ultimo Bacio&quot; 2001, Italian actress Giovanna Mezzogiorno&apos;s portrayals are so complexly simple and &apos;relishingly&apos; memorable to watch.\n\n&quot;Don&apos;t Tell&quot; may not be for everyone due to the difficult, sensitive subject matter. There were Hollywood or television movies that dealt with this &apos;beastly&apos; subject, and &quot;Bliss&quot; (1996 from writer-director Lance Young) came to mind. &quot;Bliss&quot; is more frank and direct in dealing with the sexual repression issue (the film is for mature audience.) Here with &quot;Don&apos;t Tell&quot; - based on her own novel &quot;The Beast in the heart,&quot; co-writer and director Cristina Comencini gave us a more &apos;insider viewpoint&apos; on this issue of family secrets. Through Sabina&apos;s anxieties, reactions to her nightmares, and through her brother Daniele&apos;s flashbacks and accounts of his childhood responses to his parents, we could feel the painful memories along with them.\n\nBut the film is never heavy. Comencini has created for us sketches of life: we get to see Sabina in her everyday life, meeting the people she&apos;s with and cares for. Through them, we get the balance of humor in the conversations we eavesdrop vs. the somber subject of Sabina struggling internally with unwanted childhood memories. There is Emilia - a longtime childhood blind friend Sabina helps and visits regularly; Maria - a colleague at her marital crossroads Sabina hangs out and chats with; Franco - Sabina&apos;s actor boyfriend she loves and lives with; and through Franco at work on a TV soap series, we meet the lively director Andrea Negri, who somehow adds colorful tenderness to the young (love in, love out) couple of Sabina and Franco.\n\n&quot;A scar is an indelible mark, but it&apos;s not an illness,&quot; so Daniele, now married with a loving American wife and father of two sons, said to his sister Sabina. There are painful memories that we cannot erase, but we survive and learn to live anew, going beyond the past vs. wallowing in it. &quot;Don&apos;t Tell&quot; is a worthwhile film to experience. Thanks to Rosanna Del Bruno&apos;s translation (also on Gabriele Salvatore&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m Not Scared&quot; 2003), the subtitles were easy to absorb as we appreciate the wonderful performances all round. For the fans of &quot;The Best of Youth&quot; (aka &quot;La Meglio Gioventu&quot;) 2003, both the Carati brothers are featured in this film: Luigi Lo Cascio (Nicola) is Daniele the brother, and Alessio Boni (Matteo) is Franco the boyfriend.",

As usual with most of French films, the ending is not that elaborated. But in general I think it is worth seeing it for laughing a little bit and think about your own ghosts. The flight simulator was a good add-in, and gave the film a very original feature. Marion Cotillard&apos;s was good as well, although she was not very present in the film. It&apos;d preferable to develop a bit more their relationship... Ludo&apos;s role is fantastic as well.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a perfect film for watching on a quiet Sunday morning. It made me reflect on my own life, and realize that I would probably be one of the counselors in the afterlife.\n\nIt was brilliantly written and directed and one of the most innovative stories I have seen on screen. After death, you spend a week in a way-station to reflect on your life and take one memory with you. It is not an easy process as I discovered.\n\nI was interested in the fact that some people can remember all the way back to the womb. Picking a happy memory before I was an adult is almost impossible for me, so I cannot imagine going back that far. Most people remember only to age three or four.\n\nI was fascinated with the man who wanted to leave behind some evidence of his existence. One man could not remember any happy memories in his 70+ years, so he had to sit through video tapes, one for each year of his life, to help him. It seems that there was a connection with one of the counselors and this played out in an unusual way at the end. Choosing your best memory as the fact that you were someone else&apos;s best memory and that you made one person happy.\n\nMost of us fall into the category expressed by one man. &quot;I had a so-so education, a so-so job, a so-so marriage, and a so-so retirement.&quot; How do you pick a happy or important memory from that? I also liked one man&apos;s response when he picked his memory after lamenting that most of the memories of his life were bad. After being told he would forget all the bad memories, he exclaimed, &quot;That truly is heaven.&quot; An unusual film that will be in my memory for a long time.",
