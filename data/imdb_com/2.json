I&apos;m not exaggerating -- this documentary shows us minutes upon minutes of scenes from Argento movies for no good reason literally wasting our time.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the lack of insight into the themes of Argento&apos;s work -- though, admittedly, there is some of it, but it obviously wasn&apos;t the main concern of the guys behind the documentary. All in all, it is a very shallow look into the subject.",

There are all-round excellent performances by all, from the main characters to the supporting actors and sidekicks. The songs are classics in their own right. \n\nIt leaves you with a wholesome feeling and you are likely to recommend it to others. A more catchy title would have perhaps made this movie better known that it is.",

      "reviewBody": "Jungle Moon Men (1955) \n\n* (out of 4) \n\nJohnny Weissmuller plays a character named Johnny Weissmuller who must take a female writer (Jean Byron) through the jungles where she&apos;s going to do a story about a tribe known as &quot;Moon Men&quot;. These people aren&apos;t from the moon sadly but instead they worship a princess who just happens to be some sort of relation to an Egyptian Moon goddess. This next-to-last entry in the &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; series dropped that name for some reason and had Weissmuller playing a character with his own name but there&apos;s no question what series this film belongs to. I&apos;ve read very few positive reviews to any of the Jungle Jim movies and many that I have read called this one of the worst. If this is just one of the worst and not the worst then I certainly hate myself for being a completest because I will still search out the other films in the series that I haven&apos;t seen even if that means having to torture myself with more madness. It&apos;s strange but on a technical level this is perhaps the best of the series that I&apos;ve seen but this is the major problem. It seems like more money was pumped into this film and it&apos;s clear to see that the amount of stock footage has been reduced dramatically. The earlier films in the series at least had a camp value to them because of the amount of stock footage and how poorly it mixed in with everything else going on. With that missing here the camp value is pretty much missing and all we&apos;re left with is the bad acting and bad story that all of the films have. I must admit that I was constantly losing my attention span because nothing going on stuck me as the least bit interesting. The entire adventure was a joke because not for a second did I believe anything I was seeing. The so-called drama wasn&apos;t there because the entire set-up was just tired and silly. The comic relief was just downright poor and that chimp just gets more and more annoying with each new film. Weissmuller certainly wasn&apos;t an actor and his struggles to get lines out are quite apparent here. The supporting cast isn&apos;t much better but it&apos;s very possible they all realized they were in a Jungle Jim movie and decided to just take it easy. There&apos;s very little going on in this picture to make it worth viewing. At 70-minutes it&apos;s way too long and there just aren&apos;t enough fun moments to make it worth viewing. Certainly only recommended to those who must see each film in the series."

Spader&apos;s character is a book editor and the film concerns how to keep love going as you get older. Geez, no wonder it&apos;s not mainstream."

It&apos;s nice to see a holiday film that cuts through the schmaltz. People often label It&apos;s a Wonderful Life as being too sentimental and sappy, but seem to overlook the themes of suicide, child abuse, poverty and death that run throughout the film. Things have to hit rock bottom for George Bailey to see the value of his life, as is the case in this film. The sheer darkness of what could be, as shown by the angel Gideon, make Ginny&apos;s embracing the Christmas spirit all the more resonant."

They all seem to forget that Ms. Hepburn played opposite with men much older than her, namely, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, just to name a few. The actress was always effective and showed she had an enormous charisma no matter who was her leading man.\n\n&quot;Sabrina&quot; looks as good today, as when it was first released thanks to the timeless black and white photography of Charles Lang. The big asset of the film was the unusual pairing between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. Both actors were wonderful together, as we witness in the film. William Holden, as the younger Larrabee, is excellent as well.\n\nThe film is a delightful comedy that, in comparison to Sidney Pollack&apos;s misguided and undistinguished attempt to bring it to the screen can&apos;t even compare with the witty and elegant film Mr. Wilder gave us.",

The use of present, past and even future in the story was analized as interesting editing, and the different changes of colour were considered outstanding. The sound also was considered as how to change the sequence by using different sounds, and obviously the absence of any text was considered by students in those days as the utmost in the documentary genre. The camara work was admired especially because in the days when the short was made, no steady-cam existed and everything depended on the capacity of the camareman.",

While I can&apos;t comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I&apos;ve never played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping soundtrack and plenty of boys&apos; toys.\n\nMilla Jovovich is stunning as the heroine, Alice. Whoever thought of casting Jovovich in this role deserves a bonus. Watching this beautiful star kick various forms of zombie butt while wearing a short red dress is a wonderful experience.\n\nAnderson&apos;s movies may be accused of being style over substance but there&apos;s no doubting that &quot;Shopping&quot;, &quot;Event Horizon&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil&quot; are fantastic examples of eye candy. Every shot is beautifully composed and the film has a high-budget sheen.\n\n8 out of 10. Casio G-Shock fans will be in their element watching this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;We Live Again&quot; from 1934 is filled with balalaika and Russians singing. If you can tolerate that, which is endless, you can perhaps find a kernel of interest in this film, which stars Frederic March and Anna Sten.\n\nMarch plays a socialist who returns to his family farm, where he preaches equality of the people and romances a servant (Sten). However, he soon is seduced by the comforts of the upper class, with no knowledge of the hurt he has left behind.\n\nSome time later, he is ordered to do jury duty and the servant has been accused of poisoning and robbing a man.\n\nThis is not an exciting film -- in fact, it&apos;s downright boring, particularly in the beginning. I watched it to get a gander at Anna Sten, who was brought over to the states by MGM with the intent of making her into a Garbo/Dietrich. She was very beautiful as well as a good actress, but it didn&apos;t take a genius to know that sticking her in this kind of film wasn&apos;t going to endear her to the public. She would have done better in the type of lighter film that Zanuck gave the actress Annabella. She appears to have stayed in the United States after MGM dropped her, married a producer, and worked in film and television until the mid-&apos;60s.\n\nNormally I love Rouben Mamoulian&apos;s films, but this one was a miss.",

      "reviewBody": "Not for the faint at heart, Human Zoo takes up the sociopathy of betrayal, in the context of love and war. Writer/director Rie Rasmussen also plays the main character, a woman of mixed Serbian-Albanian parentage narrowly saved from rape or worse in 1999 Kosovo by a man who is, aside from a quirky feminist streak, strictly psychopathic. During her subsequent time with him in the anarchic mafiadom of Belgrade, the camera returns to her wrist wounds from the war. She worries them open again and again; we see quiet drops of blood, richly red, artistic, fall onto an etched glass bowl in one scene, contrasting with some of the more effective portrayals of violence I&apos;ve seen in recent years in the cinema. We observe the betrayal of nearly every norm of decent society as Rasmussen rages at this world of ours. It&apos;s a particularly female form of rage, and I, for one, think it&apos;s about time the world take note.\n\nThe film was not perfect, with a couple of confused plot twists that may have been due to either over-writing, over-editing or a combination of the two. But when I see this sort of energy in a director&apos;s first feature film, that&apos;s something to which I play close attention. Lead actor Vojin Cetkovic from Serbia dominates the half of the film that takes place in Kosovo and Serbia. He played a bit role in my to-date, all-time Berlinale favorite, Klopka. He&apos;s a thinking-woman&apos;s psychopath whose ruminations on the societal constructions intended to make us &quot;human&quot; are the strongest and most startling part of Rasmussen&apos;s work. Any actor capable of making me believe someone out there could truly find it more justifiable to kill children [&quot;after all, what do they have: at most, maybe 5, 6, 7 friends?!&quot;] is, strictly speaking, a cinematic genius.\n\nI saw Human Zoo during its second Berlinale screening, and the post-film environment smacked of conspiracy, into which the audience sank with palpable satisfaction. Prior to the screening, Berlinale staff indicated it wouldn&apos;t be followed by a Q&amp;A as they didn&apos;t believe the director was present. Afterward, however, the supporting male actor, Nick Correy, jumped on stage and angrily denounced Luc Bresson, much of the time without a microphone, until one belatedly surfaced, the Berlinale crew all the while indicating that scheduling didn&apos;t allow for a Q&amp;A. He talked about obstacles to the film&apos;s financing and production, then Rasmussen showed up very briefly on stage, after which they both took it outside the theater.\n\nTheir message was that, short days before the Berlinale, a non-disclosure agreement had been signed and Bresson&apos;s name had, from complete absence, been elevated to a prominent place on the credits, this being the first time a film with his involvement had been chosen to open the Berlinale Panorama. Interestingly, IMDb has nothing linking him with this film as of this writing. Outside, the press swirled around (Variety panned it) and I thought to myself, this film will be a hit. We&apos;ll see, but with a beautiful, angry and talented actress/ex-model-cum-director/writer at the center of an artistic controversy, it has all the elements. If it actually gets released, then run, don&apos;t walk, to see this film.",

The Complex is a weird and hard to review movie... It is very intense and very scary at times, with a type of horror that never bets on jump scares, but mostly on anticipation and build-up intensity. The problem with The Complex resides with its structure. The movie changes mood and pace too often and too drastically, leaving the audience confused questioning the legitimacy of some scenes. The scenes seem to be placed with little criteria, like a puzzle that&apos;s is missing some pieces and has others upside down. It lacks solidity, leading to the inevitable feeling of unrealism: we are always aware that this is only a movie, and that is a shame because we should be absorbed and bothered by horror films. Scary? Absolutely. Well directed? Maybe this time Nakata got a little sloppy. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",

      "name": "Starring that Master of Horror, Stanley Ridges! Oh, and Karloff and Lugosi are in it too.",
      "reviewBody": "This is not a bad film; it&apos;s a serviceable &quot;B&quot; thriller. In fact it is very reminiscent of the fine Columbia Studios Boris Karloff mad doctor/gangster/horror films of the late Thirties and early Forties. Curt Siodmak collaborated with Eric Taylor on a script variation of his &quot;Donavan&apos;s Brain&quot; theme. It has the polished look of some of Universal Studio&apos;s best &quot;B&quot; movies. Arthur Lubin&apos;s direction is competent-he keeps it moving along-but lacks the zest he would bring to the 1943 remake of &quot;The Phantom of The Opera&quot; starring Claude Rains. It has a good supporting cast that includes the lovely Anne Nagel, Paul Fix, Stanley Ridges, and in a brief role as the reporter who is the recipient of Dr. Sovac&apos;s notes, James Craig. Most important of all, and this cannot be overstated, it stars Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, the greatest horror team the cinema has produced. At least that is what the credits would have us believe. And this is where the film unfortunately goes all wrong. Karloff and Lugosi were a team with a fine pedigree; &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1934) &quot;The Raven&quot; (1935) &quot;The Invisable Ray&quot; (1936) and their greatest collaboration, &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939). They even did bits together in two slight films, &quot;The Gift of Gab&quot; (1935) and &quot;You&apos;ll Find Out&quot; (1940) with Peter Lorre. The chemistry the two generated in their scenes together in their horror films was terrific. Lugosi with his daemonic will to power and Karloff with his unique ability to combine the sinister with the sympathetic have delighted audiences for over seventy years. So it is not unnatural that devotees of their films would approach &quot;Black Friday&quot; with extremely high expectations. And for those expecting another Karloff-Lugosi teaming the disappointment, the sense of being cheated, is enormous. &quot;Black Friday&quot; is not a Karloff-Lugosi film despite what the opening credits suggest. Not only do they not share any scenes together, but Bela is relegated to the perfunctory, unimportant role of Marnay with very little to do except to try to look and act like an American gangster, who coincidently just happens to sound like Count Dracula. So what happened? \n\nIt has long been rumored that Karloff was originally going to play the duel role of Prof. Kingsley/Red Cannon-the best part in the film-and Lugosi was to play Dr. Ernest Sovac-the part Karloff eventually took. This would make sense. Sovac has a Hungarian name, so Lugosi&apos;s accent would not have seemed out of place and also his daughter makes reference to his being in the process of gaining American citizenship while the Kingsley/Cannon part would have provided Karloff with a nice variation of the type of roles he had been playing at Columbia. Instead for reasons that remain a mystery, Karloff got bumped to the Sovac role-Hungarian name still intact, Lugosi got the thankless part of Marnay while Stanley Ridges, an actor no one wanted to see got the plum role of Kingsley/Cannon! Who was responsible for this ineptitude? Ridges was a good actor with a fine speaking voice, and he had a career in supporting roles, usually playing minor officials or bureaucrats but no one in their right mind would ever think about building a film around him, certainly not a horror film. Not from a box-office point of view. Not when you have the talents of BOTH Karloff and Lugosi on the payroll. Then to add insult to injury when the film didn&apos;t perform to expectations instead of blaming it&apos;s failure on the moronic casting-imagine MGM casting Marie Dressler to play Juliet and then wondering what went wrong-the studio heads chose instead to believe the Karloff-Lugosi team was no longer box-office. It was a sad end to a great horror collaboration, and the disappointment of Karloff and Lugosi fans is thoroughly understandable.\n\nUnfortunately while the miscasting is the most grievous flaw, it is not the only one. There are other problems at work undermining the film. The most serious being it completely lacks any atmosphere of horror. Like many of Universal&apos;s Forties fare the film is slick and professional but utterly lacking in any style. This can be deadly in a horror film. As mentioned before the direction is serviceable while the score-always one of the strong points of the Universal horror films-is simply stock music and forgettable, except when it recycles some of Hans J. Salter&apos;s themes from earlier horror films. The same might be said of Elwood Bredell&apos;s cinematography-its serviceable but nothing more. And that pretty much sums up this last teaming of Karloff and Lugosi in a Universal horror film. Its serviceable and nothing more and thats sad because with a little more thought and care-and more intelligent casting-it could have been quite good. It is somewhat ironic that RKO Pictures, Universals great horror competitor of the Forties actually provided a more fitting coda for the Karloff-Lugosi team in the beautifully atmospheric 1945 Val Lewton production of &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;. They have only one real scene together but it showcases both stars. And it gives Lugosi, in ill health and drug-ridden as he was, one last chance to show the world he was a fine actor and not just a flamboyant personality."

For some reason, one person (involved with this movie?) thought there was something offensive in here, but there isn&apos;t. Make up your own mind, in the following review originally titled: &quot;Ratatouille?&quot; ...\n\nOf course not. But if you have seen that movie, you will wonder how an animated mouse can be emotionally more engaging than a real life human being? And I&apos;m not saying that, because the main actor is weak. It is the story that lacks the drive and the force. You cannot judge the actors, if they have so little to work with. It&apos;s almost a shame, because there are a few good hints at where this could go, but unfortunately, it never does achieve anything.\n\nWhile the mouse did not only have a goal, it was more approachable and you had the feeling that it was more human, even with &quot;lesser&quot; problems. But I&apos;m straying away. There is quite a few things to discover here, and while the ultimate goal seems to be the same, the cook on display here, has other things on his mind, too. It is more complex. And while in the end, it seems to take the easy way out, it might leave you with a good taste ...",

But never watched his work before.  Maybe it was that critics saying good things about a film and you don&apos;t want to see it.\n\nBut my friends watched this and they all recommended it and so I gave it a shot.  Well I was astonished.  This film deals with relationships-especially relationships between men and women, can be called a comedy impov, but thereÂ¡Â¯s not a single sweet moment that we usually see in romantic comedies.\n\n This film shows us two successive love affairs a man experience and itÂ¡Â¯s really amazing how the director portrays them perceiving their relationship on their own ground.  The characters are all everyday figures, sometimes you feel ashamed just looking at them because they could be you in your past relations.  Again Very Straightforward film and if you want something sweet avoid this one, but if you want something that raise something to think about, go for it, watch it, feel ashamed and think over it.",

I don&apos;t know much about the Lapp/Sami people or their struggles in the past(I regret that) but you can substitute any ethnic/minority group and get a feel of the injustice that&apos;s being portrayed. Violence is almost always the product of social injustice. This is a universal stuggle between oppressed and opressor; be it a church, a state or corporation. Greed is a fire that burns all, at the end. Ars Gratia Artis &quot;Art for the sake of Art&quot; seems to be the motto of most films nowadays. Not this one.

However, having only ordinary schooling, her request is turned down due to her lack of qualification to the position. Gladys works hard as a maid and uses all her savings and salaries to buy a train ticket to Tientsin. Then she travels by mule to the remote province of Wangcheng, where she works with the Englishwoman Jeannie Lawson (Athene Seyler) and the Chinese cook Yang (Peter Chong) in the Inn of the Sixth Happiness. When Ms. Lawson has an accident and dies, Gladys has no money to run the establishment and accepts the position of &quot;foot inspector&quot; offered by the Mandarin Hsien Chang (Robert Donat). She is assigned to visit the countryside to promote and enforce the government&apos;s law against foot binding Chinese girls. She is successful, changes her nationality to Chinese and her name to Jen-ai (meaning &quot;the one who loves people&quot;), surprising the skeptical bi-racial Captain Lin Nan (Curt Jurgens). When Wangcheng is invaded by the Japanese, Jen-ai travels through the mountains with one hundred children to save them from death.\n\n&quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; is a wonderful and engaging epic based on the true story of the enlightened Gladys Aylward. Her biography romanticized by Hollywood is awesome, and the movie is fantastic. Ingrid Bergman is stunning in the role of a servant in a period of class struggle in London determined to go to China where she believes she belongs and has a mission from God to be accomplished. The colors and the landscapes are impressive, but the cast of Ingrid Bergman as a woman not gorgeous; Curt Jurgens as a Chinese-Caucasian; and Robert Donat as a Chinese is weird, but they have perfect performances and I believe that is what matters in a film. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Morada da Sexta Felicidade&quot; (&quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I found this movie important, enthralling, and maddening. Important, because Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace, deserves iconic status today. After all, she was the first computer programmer on record. Ada&apos;s character is well-portrayed by Tilda Swinton, who gives her both excellent clarity and a fascinating wild side. The backdrops on the past sections are recognizably digital, but lushly colorful.\n\nThe maddening part comes from the modern sections, where we are given a modern programmer who contacts Ada through her computer. This narrative drags the movie down, because it&apos;s just not as interesting as Ada. The dragging bothered me, because I really wanted to love this movie.\n\nThroughout the movie, women are explored as complex characters, while men are rendered as arbitrarily cruel caricatures. Oh, well, turnabout is fair play, I suppose, but it didn&apos;t enhance my appreciation of the film.\n\nOverall, I&apos;d say, see this film. Ada Lovelace is important to our generation. Grit your teeth and sit through whatever you don&apos;t like.",

Surely this is a false economy? How much difference in price is there between good quality stock and the rubbish stuff? Is it purely to match the stock footage(volcanoes) and avoid those Irwin Allen type mismatches? This film is worth watching if you want to be a completist, but the previous criticisms, hammy acting, ludicrous dinosaurs are all correct, but I can&apos;t agree that the two principals are second rate. Warner was an actor of promise before he went to Hollywood(see Gielgud&apos;s comments on Claude Rains{irony alert 1960 version}). There are also mistakes, piranhas in Africa, guns not firing, why do the workers wear their tin helmets all the time? Whatever happened to Nathania Stanford? Just these two films? Probably saw sense and got a life.",

What does the average person know about life in Uganda today? Watching these children tell their heart-wrenching stories made me want to go to there and visit their village. I think because of the contest these children have hopes and dreams again. They rose above the horrors of war and achieved, in a sense, nobility, not just for themselves but for their whole tribe. Directors/writers Sean Fine and Andrea Nix ought to receive an academy award for their excellent work! Do not miss this film! Its images will stay with you for a long time.",

Where special effects and CGI are increasingly used (no matter what the genre) and you only have to look elsewhere to see overblown performances and overblown auteur directing, Goldstein and Poots give performances with nothing to hide behind, making this one of the most sincere films I have seen in years.\n\nAt the Q&amp;A following the screening, director, writer &amp; stars joked that this film only got made because Brett got famous but of all the films they could have made, I am so glad and greatly appreciate they made this one.",

The whole movie was transparent beyond words. If you couldn&apos;t figure out what was gonna happen within the first twenty minutes, then you weren&apos;t watching it.\n\nThe acting is pretty solid. Lizzy Caplan is great as she always is. John Patrick Amedori was great also, he did a fabulous job. Overall the acting was solid and parts of the story has tons of potential that it never tapped into.",

      "reviewBody": "This Universal B picture is yet another example of Hollywood taking a famous character of the old west and fashioning their own story about him without a bit of reality to it. All that I can say is that Black Bart did go by the real name of Charles Bolles and they did do his crime thing in California in the 19th century. Other than that this film has nothing to do with Black Bart&apos;s real story.\n\nAmong other things Black Bart was always a gentleman and left a bit of poetic verse at the scene of each robbery. Not a line of poetry comes from Dan Duryea&apos;s lips. As Black Bart died in 1888 and Lola Montez died in 1861 it&apos;s highly unlikely they ever even met.\n\nYvonne DeCarlo plays the exotic dancer who had King Ludwig of Bavaria panting for more. But that&apos;s all done with, Lola&apos;s in America on a tour and she&apos;s now in San Francisco. On the way there she meets up with Black Bart when he holds up the stagecoach. Also along are a pair of Duryea&apos;s associates from his past, Jeffrey Lynn and Percy Kilbride. They know Duryea even behind the mask and want in on the set up. Lynn also wants in on Lola Montez.\n\nBlack Bart despite its gross historical inaccuracies is an interesting and unique film. No happy endings for anyone here as Duryea and Lynn go out like Butch and Sundance. Yvonne DeCarlo is properly fetching as Lola though I think the one who should have played Lola in a better film of her life should have been Greta Garbo.",

The opening (the kidnapping) and closing sequences (the in and out rescue at night) do manage to rally plenty of tension especially during the climax set against an isolated medieval monastery in the mountains, but in between that it&apos;s somewhat mechanical in its elaborate structure. A waiting game and plans being formulated with some preachy inclusions. Well we have revolutionary terrorists fighting imperialism. Gladly Coburn&apos;s hardy presence keeps you hooked for the ride. Director Douglas Hickox paces it rather well and his streamlined handling offers numerous nitty gritty passages, despite some stagy moments. Music composer Lalo Schifrin gives the presentation a bit more oomph with his grand, luxurious arrangement. A tough, but breezy 70-s drive-in action adventure.",

      "name": "Awful in the extreme, but manages to be unbelievably entertaining due to it&apos;s immense stupidity and terrible performances.",
      "reviewBody": "Before going any further, I may as well make this short and sweet. Raw Justice is awful. In every angle it&apos;s cheap and trashy. It is however, hilariously awful and I&apos;d like to recommend it for that very reason.\n\nIn the opening scene Mace (David Keith) is out to bust some guy who&apos;s just jumped bail. He could have easily have kicked the door open and shown him the gun and the cuffs. But no, this guy doesn&apos;t like conventional methods so he decides to &quot;borrow&quot; some clothes from a hooker so he can enter the room as a hooker for reasons unknown. Somehow this genius plan doesn&apos;t go smoothly and the bail jumper manages to make a run for it, and what follows is a foot chase with David Keith dressed in drag. Ho ho ho! Funny, right?\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch McCullum (Robert Hays) has just had a one-night stand with the Mayor&apos;s daughter. After dropping her off at her home, Deputy Mayor Bob Jenkins (Stacy Keach) orders some hit-man to kill her, not before showing us her rubbing herself repeatedly as she showers nude. After performing the hit and stealing some computer floppy disks, Jenkins decides not to pay him, but rather to kill him instead. Turns out Jenkins is fed up being Deputy, and wants promotion. So in order to live his dream, he decides that killing Mayor David Stiles&apos; (Charles Napier) daughter who was currently writing a book, adding a chapter about incest to her book then threatening Stiles that if he doesn&apos;t resign his position as Mayor in his next speech, he&apos;ll release the book to the public. Wow! Why did nobody else ever think of a great plan like that before?! The way this movie handles it is even worse. It just doesn&apos;t know where to go.\n\nMayor Stiles hires Mace to investigate, as apparently a loose cannon is exactly what he needs. He meets up with Mitch, the guy who had the one night stand and was initially accused of the murder and the two reluctantly team up and get involved in a couple of shootouts, a crappy car chase, a barfight and a swamp boat chase with hit men and corrupt cops all appearing out of nowhere. As for Pamela Anderson, her character is completely detached from the main plot and the reason for shoehorning her into it is the lamest thing. She plays the hooker whose clothes Mace takes at the start. During the middle of the movie, Mace bumps into her by coincidence and she&apos;s angry because he left her outside in her underwear and never returned her clothes. During her whining, bad guys pop up and shoot at our heroes. Now she&apos;s been seen with them, she&apos;s now part of it and can&apos;t be let go.\n\nYeah, I know...\n\nJust prior to the Mayor&apos;s speech, our heroes have just won a barfight. Mace presses corrupt cop Atkins (Leo Rossi) for information as to who he&apos;s working for, he gives in and says he&apos;s working for Deputy Mayor Bob Jenkins. Mace doesn&apos;t even interrogate him for any more information, all he gets is a name before Atkins goes for his gun and is killed, so the only evidence they have against Jenkins is the word of a now deceased cop who our heroes have killed.\n\nSo the Mayor&apos;s speech has now begun, and if he doesn&apos;t resign his position, Jenkins will release the edited book to the public. Instead, he announces that Jenkins is responsible for the murder of his daughter. Jenkins responds by claiming that Stiles had her killed when suddenly our heroes enter the room in and Mace says &quot;I don&apos;t think so. Atkins talked&quot;. Jenkins then goes insane and takes Stiles hostage. Now, the only evidence they have against Jenkins is one name from a deceased cop who the heroes have killed. What evidence is there that they&apos;re even the good guys? Despite his original plan being idiotic, the evidence against Jenkins was minimal so I see no reason at all for him to have taken hostages. He&apos;s so unbelievably stupid it&apos;s a wonder how he obtained his position as deputy mayor in the first place.\n\nBut it gets worse. Jenkins escapes to the roof with his hostage and demands a helicopter. A helicopter appears and after taking off the pilot turns round and it&apos;s revealed to be Mace. Yeah, like they&apos;re going to give a chopper to some burnt out ex cop. He jumps out into the river and leaves the helicopter with Jenkins to crash into a skyscraper which would not only cause a huge amount of property damage but would seriously endanger innocent civilians both on the ground and in the building. In reality this guy would have been arrested and thrown in jail to rot, here not only does he get off without so much as a slap on the wrist, the mayor has &quot;straightened things out&quot; with him because of this wonderful act of courage! \n\nDavid Keith is just woeful. Not only does he look awful, but manages to make his character as repulsive and unlikeable as possible. He basically rapes Pamela Anderson&apos;s character just after a shootout. Robert Hays is not as bad as Keith but that&apos;s not saying much. Reliable B-movie veterans Charles Napier, Stacy Keach and Leo Rossi are wasted. Pamela Anderson has absolutely no reason for being there other than to have two long and boring sex scenes. Her acting is atrocious and her line delivery is at times hilarious, especially in the scene where she tries to comfort Mitch who&apos;s feeling sorry for himself by telling him &quot;I think you&apos;re being a bit hard on yourself&quot;. \n\nOverall, this is awful but I highly recommend anyone who loves bad movies to check it out. I could go on, but I have a minimum of 1000 words! User &quot;bob the moo&quot; took it way too seriously!"

      "reviewBody": "The Dutch making a zombie movie... That&apos;s like Americans making a movie about cheese. Still there&apos;s a lot to enjoy in Zombibi. First of all, with a very modest budget of about Â 500.000 the picture looks great. The actors do what they can to entertain and although you cannot always understand what they&apos;re saying, you never get bored. To see Amsterdam turn into a zombie zone is also very nice for a change. Actress Gigi Ravelli, known in Holland for her role in the soap GTST, is very funny as a kick-ass cop. \n\nOverall it&apos;s the story that lets you down. A man wants to rescue a girl and must travel across Amsterdam to do so. The finale is in a skyscraper in Amsterdam Zuidoost, the place where also an alien spaceship crashed that caused this zombie outbreak anyway. Our heroes must fight themselves into the building and save the day. \n\nIn terms of zombies we have seen it all before and the fact that this one takes place in Holland is a novelty that soon wears off. Yes, this movie goes over the top, or it least tries to. But in the end the film remains pretty safe and ends in standard mode. Makes you wonder what kind of movie somelone like Paul Verhoeven would&apos;ve made out of it. \n\nI think Zombibi was a nice attempt to make a zombie comedy and it&apos;s clear that making it was pure fun. But with more black humour and sick jokes it could have been something special.\n\n7/10",

Exciting, ceaselessly and unstoppably powerful, acted with herculean guile, fervour and passion. This is quite possibly the most exciting film I&apos;ve ever seen. The drama, wit and ferocity of the bulk of the film build so, so effectively to its deafening crescendo, the music, the setting, the actors and the camera-work complementing and intertwining with each other in a way quite possibly unmatched in anything else I&apos;ve seen. And another great think about it is its shameless, paradoxically both subtle and explicit POLITICAL content. This is Wajda&apos;s demonstration that however much he may be portrayed as a hero of Poland&apos;s rebellion against its socialist regime, he is at the same time sympathetic to the cause which drove Marxism, and hostile to the vulgarities of the interaction of man and money, the dehumanising, reifying assault with which rampant capitalism engages with the human psyche. If this is propaganda, then it is a heartfelt, stunningly effective damasking of the myth with which we all live today.\n\nBy the way, I&apos;ve only seen the re-released version, shorter than the original. Should i also see the longer 1974 version? I think the freshness and crispness of the cinematography in the more recent version might have added to the film."

      "reviewBody": "Marma was released at the time most of the horrible crappy directors were trying to keep the horror genre alive with their newly fangled ideas that more or less were limited to one particular subject - explicit bold scenes. Despite its shoe string budget, the movie is enjoyable until the last scene. This is a highly unpredictable thriller that has doses of delusion, love, psychology and belief. There are also several moments that take you to the state of &apos;Haute Tension&apos; at times . Marma (original Kannada title) was released under the name &apos;Shock - Ek Raat&apos; in Hindi. As I am not much into South Cinema, I didn&apos;t bother about the star cast, and believe me whatever I saw, was perfectly mind blowing.\n\nSudha (Prema) has been engaged to Anand (Anand). Sudha belongs to a high profile family and so does Anand. Anand decides to throw a party at his farm house to celebrate their engagement. Anand is somehow unable to pick Sudha from her home and requests her to join the party at his farm house on her own. The weather outside is frowning with anger. Sudha drives off her car but is caught amidst heavy downpour. On the way she stops at a gas station and the friendly attendant warns her of the bad weather. Sudha somehow forgets the way to Anand&apos;s farm house and ends up at a cottage, where she finds a man in blue denims basking before fire. She tries to call him again and again but the man won&apos;t respond. Sudha gathers some more courage and goes upstairs where she finds a dead woman behind the wall. It looks that the woman was a fresh kill and the man in denims had killed her and is now waiting for a good time to get rid of the corpse. Sudha is horrified and turns behind only to find the man in denims approaching her. She rushes to the balcony but loses control and falls down unconscious.\n\nNext morning, Sudha finds herself at the hospital. Her family soon arrives and she is discharged. It seems Sudha somehow saved severe injuries. However, she doesn&apos;t remember how she ended up at the hospital all by herself. Soon a transformation in Sudha&apos;s personality begins. She has a button, which according to her belongs to the man in denims. Despite hard trials, she is unable to forget him. Later she claims that the man in denims appears in her room and tries to kill her. Her family seeks help of an exorcist but Sudha disgraces and beats him up badly. Sudha&apos;s father is much worried of her condition and fortifies his house, reinforces the security and unleashes watch dogs. However, these tricks don&apos;t work as we see Sudha struggling in her room with an unseen entity, who she claims is the man in denims. Sudha doesn&apos;t have more than a button to justify the existence of the killer. Due to Sudha&apos;s falling mental health her marriage with Anand is postponed. Finally a certain Psycholologist Dr. Rao is able to find a cure for Sudha, but Sudha was much better when she was ill, because after getting cured she has to face a truth she never dreamed of.\n\nI keep this movie very close to me. It has various unthinkable twists that continuously surprise and trouble the viewers. Prema in her performance has said more than she was expected to. The tricky camera work adds value to the story and the performances by other characters remain praiseworthy. The best thing about &apos;Marma&apos; is its continuity and restlessness. At places the atmosphere goes so tense that the mind seeks peace. I bet Sunil Kumar Desai has much to teach to the Bollywood horror veteran directors like Ram Gopal Verma and others. Now I am not expecting &apos;Marma&apos; to be compared with &apos;Darna Mana Hai&apos;, &apos;Agyaat&apos;, &apos;Haunted 3D&apos; and so on as such films are merely a mixture of pathetic imagination, foolish storyline, bad scares and overacting fools. A bunch of Bollywood horror directors of the new era with all their best efforts and mega star cast wouldn&apos;t be able to make a low-budget masterpiece like &apos;Marma&apos;, which has much to do with the evil inside than the evil outside."

Actually, it&apos;s just the first third or that is a problem. The beginning has quite a bit of poor acting and preposterous behavior from the survivors of a crashed space ship on an unknown planet. They adjust to the monstrous crash they&apos;ve just been through, which is well done, and new surroundings astoundingly rapidly. They barely seem shook up and are not remotely believable. However, it gets better and the last two thirds are still pretty exciting. I kind of remembered the final scenes, but not the actual ending, so I was a little surprised, which is always good. Bottom line, this is a pretty good sorta Grade B type movie that gave the world Vin Diesel for better or worse. There was a terrible sequel to this, with Judi Dench no less, and another that I don&apos;t think I saw. The director hasn&apos;t made a film since Riddick 13 years ago and is now making two more. This character is this guy&apos;s directing career!",

Given von Stroheim&apos;s uncompromising attitude to filmmaking means that none of his films ever released exactly how he wanted and it&apos;s no different here, vastly over budget, vastly behind schedule and vastly self-indulgent, including the use of thousands of litres of real champagne and locking his cast on a sealed set to shoot an orgy... Silent film directors are insane. It&apos;s tragic to remember that even with everything going for The Wedding March, it&apos;s barely one-third of von Stroheim&apos;s original vision, as the majority of his original edit was massively truncated and the second half of the film he shot, The Honeymoon, is now lost to time. That alone is painfully frustrating. The Wedding March is not the masterpiece it could have been but stands as a testament to Erich von Stroheim&apos;s incredible filmmaking talent to this day.",

      "reviewBody": "Eden Log is somewhat of a good surprise for a french scifi movie. Think of a arty and elaborate form, beautiful black and white photography with rare under lit colors.\n\nWhat matters here is the mood more than the script, the first half of Eden Log is just the claustrophobic graphic story of a guy covered in mud trying to get out of a dark and low-tech labyrinth, with no memory at all of how he got there. There are very few dialogs, and there aren&apos;t even necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, the last third of the movie doesn&apos;t quite lives up to it&apos;s beginning, the script is somehow too confuse and too explicit at the same time, and the dark and mysterious image of the beginning vanish due to the necessity of writing an acceptable end.\n\nStill i would recommend this movie, it has a very original tone and form, rarely seen these days, and manages to create something on its own, aside from both the Hollywood scene, and the overall shitty genre french scene (if you&apos;ve seen Chrysalis, you exactly know what i mean !) More than that : If you&apos;re fan of graphic and kind of arty movies like Tarkovsky&apos;s Stalker, Cube, Aronofsky&apos;s Pi, Caro &amp; Jeunet&apos;s Le Bunker De La DerniÃ¨re Rafale, that Forsaken thing or Guy Maddin&apos;s pictures you should definitely check it !",

Pierce Brosnan makes a convincing scientist, whose passion and desire to protect the townspeople plays off nicely with Mayor Linda Hamilton&apos;s similar concerns.\n\nBut what I most want to say is that the volcano itself was both believable and accurate. So I want to commend the filmmakers for having enough integrity to make an entertaining film within the boundaries of scientific accuracy. And face it, you don&apos;t go to a movie like Dante&apos;s Peak to see insightful drama, or peer deep into the human psyche. The people and the volcano play off each other very nicely. It&apos;s not often you get a film with both chemistry and physics.",

It all made me wish the action was allowed to go on a bit longer, because while the action is frequent, most of the set pieces themselves are pretty brief. I guess that&apos;s part of the movie overall being fast-paced, whipping between three main characters all within a runtime of under 90 minutes, but it&apos;s a little sad how quickly some action scenes end. I might&apos;ve also liked this a little more had it been more comedic outside its action (I wouldn&apos;t really call it a comedy, but some might), but that also feels a bit nitpicky. Most of this is a good time, I liked the leads, and it delivers fun action/thrills in a gloriously over-the-top way.",

Both are on their way to college and neither want to go there as virgins. They decide to make a pact with each other that they will both lose it before they leave. Things are going along fine until they meet and start to like the same boy. This is a plot that has been done to death. Usually though the movie is a comedy and this is a drama. The one thing this does have going for it that the others don&apos;t is great actors. The acting alone is enough to keep this from becoming too cheesy or cookie-cutter like. The movie is very predictable and again is something you have seen a hundred times but Fanning and Olsen together are a great team. There are moments that make you cry and make you angry but overall this is a movie that will give you a good feeling. Overall a movie that who&apos;s plot has been done to death but the acting makes it feel fresh. A very good coming of age movie that teen girls should watch to show what is really important in life. I give this a high B+.",

I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II). So after all of that I give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).",

      "reviewBody": "Liebe &apos;47 describes a place and a time we cannot imagine today. I include in that description the impossibility of imagining the emotional place that Germans were in at the end of World War II.\n\nEverything that could have been destroyed WAS destroyed - lives, families, morality. All that was left was the ruins of a vaguely remembered time and place. The dislocation was profound.\n\nTwo figures, a man and a woman are seen separately at the waters edge (Hamburg docks). They are contemplating suicide. They have lost everything and appear to have nothing to live for. We see them come together. Other shadowy (Bergmanesque) figures swirl in the sidelines and discuss the destinies of our two players.\n\nWe see Anna&apos;s story first. She has suffered greatly. Shattered dreams, harsh realities. Terrible. Her story is handled sensitively and superbly, and sets the scene in many ways. Nazi era films tended to show women in minor/love interest/home maker or subservient roles as this was the place assigned to them by the regime. Not in Liebe &apos;47 though. Here we see a different reality. Anna is downtrodden, abused and broken. She is a hero that many post-war German women could identify with.\n\nThen we see JÃ¼rgen&apos;s story - a war survivor from the German army. He is also a hero - but not a hero through military acts of bravery...\n\nI watched Liebe &apos;47 in the original German without subtitles. My German isn&apos;t great - but I managed, despite the basic sound quality, because the images are strong, the acting is strong and the stories and emotions shine through.\n\nThe film really gets to work in the second half (building on Anna&apos;s story), when JÃ¼rgen is forced again to confront the banalities of war and the subsequent peace. Or rather, we the viewer are forced to confront his realities. The scenes he sets up in a Cabaret bar and at the home of his former commanding officer are unnerving and carefully chosen by the script writers. The bizarre dream images he conjours are impactful and surreal. The implication is that Germany has endured some kind of apocalyptic schizophrenic nightmare that it is only just waking from, wondering what happened, daring to remember.... There are further implications for audience to consider.\n\nThis is a good film, with impactful story telling made in an ex-Luftwaffe hangar in GÃ¶ttingen on next-to-no resources or budget.\n\nThe ending is strong (no spoilers). Our two characters have fought their way to here. They have survived, somehow, and decide that they should look after each other. This is the moral core of the film.\n\nLiebe &apos;47 is a TrÃ¼mmerfilm - rubble film. The meaning here being - the rubble of previous lives. Historic films - we need to see these pieces. They are usually bleak - but they show us aspects of the human condition that we would not otherwise see. Watch Liebe &apos;47 and see what you think.",

      "reviewBody": "Familiar plot. Familiar reaction. Just maybe, the casting pushes this action/drama through to the end. Bobby Bishop(Charlie Sheen)is a major player in Washington D.C. for he is a special assistant to the President(Sam Waterston). Bobby is given a tip that there is a covert action being put into place to overthrow the government. To find out more details he is to meet Professor Yuri Pochenko(Theodore Bikel)only to watch him be gunned down by a sniper. Bobby&apos;s mentor, Jacob Conrad(Donald Sutherland), thinks he is just over reacting. Bishop&apos;s former girlfriend Amanda Givens(Linda Hamilton)is known as a sharp investigative reporter and is more than willing to help ferret out this much rumored activity. Bishop finds himself running for his life in a chain of chaos and confusion. A Special Agent(Stephen Lang)is hell-bent on killing him before he can blow the whistle on the attack on the existing government.\n\nBen Gazzara plays Vice President Saxon and Gore Vidal has the role of Congressman Page. Nicholas Turturro is an expert technician in surveillance. The plot does reach a fever pitch and the action is heavy and exciting. The most believable of the cast is Lang, who seems to have unlimited lives. Sutherland&apos;s talents are wasted. Sheen may be taxing his abilities. This movie is better than you may think.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the best British films of the 1960&apos;s, &quot;Seance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; is now available on DVD through general distribution. This should help the film to gain the wider appeal that it deserves.\n\nThis succeeds on all levels - extraordinary direction with riveting tracking shots, evocative cinematography, great set pieces, a winding plot, and amazing acting from the two leads. The showy yet introspective role of Myra Savage might be one to elicit histrionics and stern looks in the wrong hands, but the character is immensely deepened and supplemented by Kim Stanley&apos;s superbly rich &quot;Method&quot; performance. Stanley is matched by Richard Attenborough&apos;s Bill Savage, attenuated and subordinated by his wife&apos;s unstable, grasping personality.\n\nMuch has been said about Stanley&apos;s performance as a deserving Academy Award winner. This is difficult to judge. Most of the awards presented in 1965 were for lighter films, and it is difficult to find fault with Julie Andrew&apos;s now legendary performance as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Deeper inspection of past Awards shows a predilection toward films of an escapist nature during certain times, such as &quot;Going My Way&quot; during the dark, uncertain days of World War II 1943/1944. Could the same be said of the tumultuous aftermath of Kennedy&apos;s assassination and other upheavals? Under any circumstance, this film is a masterpiece with no small debt to the acting of Stanley and Attenborough. Seek this out and you will be richly rewarded - 10 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I was deeply moved by original version of this movie despite my survival Italian. Recently, I had the chance to see it again with English subtitles. Yes, indeed, watching as The Gold Rimmed Glasses verifies my earlier conclusion that it delivers a timeless story on rise of oppression and versatility of human emotions -- in the very negative sense-- depending on political climate, in other words, societal readiness for submission. Based on Giorgio Bassani&apos;s novel, The Gold Rimmed Glasses unfolds story of outcasts on two levels, social-political and individual. Set in 1938 Ferrara, Italy, those layers are interwoven beautifully. University student David (Rupert Everett), a wealthy Jewish family witnesses in great despair the rise of Mussolini fascism along with increasingly alarming racial laws and neighborhood hate and hostility. Staying calm on the eve of a world war becomes a virtual reality for Jews and anyone &quot;different,&quot; which brings second layer of the story come into play. Played by Phillippe Noiret, doctor Fadigati is not a Jew but feels like one of the &quot;others&quot; because of his homosexuality. He wants his own life and keep cool as much as possible, however, the inevitable game of survival with rise of fascism haunts him in the aftermath of his boyfriend&apos;s abuse. In a poisoned atmosphere, where Mussolini finds alliance with Hitler, only David and Fadigati can understand and support each other. Dismayed by his girlfriend&apos;s decision to convert to Catholicism, David does his best to rage against changing times, whereas Fadigati yields to his fate. Under Giuliano Montaldo&apos;s direction, Phillippe Noiret and Rupert Everett are wonderful in their roles. They deserve extra credit by playing Italian characters considering former being French and latter being British. A great movie in Italian, I hope, The Gold Rimmed Glasses gets digital restoration eventually to receive international acclamation it deserves."

Those memories will be something I won&apos;t forget. To top it off, John Amos and Tim Conway also made a surprise visit to my parents, cousin, and Aunt&apos;s restaurant also located in Stockton, California. It was called &quot;Al Funzo&apos;s.It was a great evening for me, and my family, and the Restaurant patrons that came in that night.As for the movie, The World&apos;s Greatest Athlete&quot; was and still is excellent, and ranks high in my list of favorite movies.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has it all, it has drama, action, special effects you name it. It also has a nice resolving conclusion to the Kirk era of Star Trek, the possibility of peace among Klingons and Humans.\n\nOn the technical side the directing is beautifully and masterfully done by Nicholas Meyer. Well edited movie. The director took careful consideration to keep you in suspense, for example, hiding the villain in the background of the light, things like that.  The special effects, though not remarkable, as in The Wrath of Khan&apos;s in-your-face effects, the effects in this movie generally are good, the battle sequences in this movie are just as good as The Wrath of Khan one.\n\nAgain a nice motif is the scripts placement of Shakespeare quotes into the villain, just like Khan in Star Trek II.  Speaking of the villain, Chang, here you see excellent acting thanks to the actor Christopher Plummer.\n\nThere are a lot of in-line jokes, which adds to that atmosphere of closeness between the characters.  Sulu&apos;s transfer to a new ship, the Excelsior is sought here.  The set construction and pieces are great.  The new enterprise bridge looks more military like.  The presidential office (may note it is a redone Ten Forward from St, the next generation), the peace talk location, etc.\n\nThe end of the movie has a sad feeling towards it, a teary farewell to the crew of the Enterprise, and a clear passing of the torch to the new crew.\n\nA great movie that you must see,\n\nRating: 9/10"

After the mass, Karin Persson (Gunnel Lindblom) seeks out the pastor with her husband, the fisherman Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow), and tells that Jonas is tormented by an existential crisis when he learns that China has an atomic bomb and intends to commit suicide. Tomas unsuccessfully attempts to comfort Jonas but he is not convincing due to his lack of faith and Jonas kills himself with a shot of rifle in his head. Meanwhile, the schoolteacher MÃ¤rta Lundberg (Ingrid Thulin) is in love with Tomas, but the widowed pastor rejects her love with bitter and tough words. In the end, Tomas discusses with the sacristan the true suffering of Jesus Christ in the Passion of Christ. \n\n&quot;NattvardsgÃ¤sterna&quot; is the second part of Bergman&apos;s Trilogy of Silence with an unpleasant story of unrequited love, lack of communication and lack of faith on God. The pastor Tomas Ericsson is one of the bitterest characters that I have ever seen, and his speech to MÃ¤rta Lundberg is one of the cruelest and coldest of a man to a woman in love. The performances are awesome as usual in a Bergman&apos;s film, with wonderful black-and-white cinematography, and this cold film does not have soundtrack. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Luz de Inverno&quot; (&quot;Light of Winter&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In his glorious Bringing Up Baby, Howard Hawks ratchets screwball comedy up to its tautest and springiest level. In clumsier hands, screwball all too often gallops into the frenetic, fraying the nerves; Hawks maintains a presto pace, but never lets the mixups and misunderstandings grow implausible Â he just glides serenely to something else. (And he makes it look easy, which it isn&apos;t: Peter Bogdanovich fumbled in his loose remake What&apos;s Up, Doc, making it labored and literal-minded.) \n\nHawks could barely go wrong with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant as his leads, but the rest of the cast he assembles, human as well as animal, can&apos;t be faulted either (with the redoubtable May Robson earning extra credit). And while he draws on stock characters and stereotypes that probably date back to commedia dell&apos;arte Â the stuffy professor, the blithe rich girl, her crusty dowager aunt, the bumbling sheriff Â he freshens each one up, making them distinctive, memorable and endearing.\n\nBehind a pair of repressive spectacles, Grant plays the single-minded paleontologist whose path crosses with that of madcap Hepburn, never again to uncross. The plot revolves around a leopard named Baby, a million dollars, an intercostal clavicle bone, a dog named George who buries it....well, it all makes perfect sense while you&apos;re watching.\n\nUnderneath all the antics, Hawks never loses sight of the pastoral romance that Bringing Up Baby at its core really is (at its most magical in the woods under a full moon, and captured by Russell Metty&apos;s lovely photography). Grant&apos;s been rooting around in the dirt for so long looking for dinosaur bones that it takes him forever to &apos;get&apos; Hepburn Â an airborne sprite who never comes down to earth. (Their alchemy here is rarefied, not the commoner sort of reaction they kindled in the stage-bound The Philadelphia Story.) \n\nLast but not least, the movie features the canine talents of Asta (nÃ© Skippy), who appeared as himself in the Thin Man series Â Nick and Nora Charles&apos; lovable cur. Here he plays George, who, barking his stubby tail off, has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this high-strung wire-haired terrier is and will forever be (pace Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie) Hollywood&apos;s top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby, the most exquisite comedy of the sound era.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dead &amp; Buried&quot; is a classic horror &quot;small town with a secret&quot; film, this time concerning a tiny little seaside town called Potter&apos;s Bluff. The formerly peaceful community has suddenly been plagued by a series of grisly murders for the town sheriff Dan (James Farentino) to investigate. Creepier still, the murder victims reappear as walking, talking, friendly townsfolk. And what does the eccentric town mortician (Jack Albertson) have to do with it?\n\nThis rarely talked about flick, above all else, is a masterpiece of atmosphere...moodily lit, foggy, with a genuine sense of claustrophobia as the horrors seem to be closing in closer and closer to Dan&apos;s own home and family, especially the strange new habits his wife (Melody Anderson) has taken up lately.\n\nAll of the actors are solid enough, but Jack Albertson steals the show as the eccentric, big band loving Mortician Dobbs. In one of his final performances, he delivers a character whose unsettling realism and reverence for the dead will make you completely forget his also classic turn as the kindly grandpa in &quot;Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory&quot;. Rather than just play this character, he inhabits his psyche and becomes Dobbs, and it shows.\n\nEverything from the low key bits of airy score music to the often slow and dreamlike pacing of the plot, is dedicated to heightening the viewer sense of disconnection and dread, leading up to a well known sort of &quot;twist&quot; climax, which in this context doesn&apos;t seem hackneyed.\n\nMy only real problem with this film is that the pacing can sometimes seem jarring, with little connection to scenes preceding it, almost to the point of breaking the well crafted mood. Also, the climax was a bit too abrupt and a few more seconds of that final anguished scene would&apos;ve done a lot to increase the film&apos;s overall impact.\n\nI&apos;d still highly recommend &quot;Dead &amp; Buried&quot;, as a solid reminder of what imaginative and well made R rated horror used to be, before the parade of dull remakes and tamed to PG-13 bore fests that now clutter the genre."

After he loses the girl&apos;s communion dress, virtually half the population of Rome gets involved in getting her suitably attired and brought to the church on time. Aldo Fabrizi plays the father with immense gusto and is a wonder to behold. This Roman actor of vaudeville, stage, and screen is most familiar to non-Italian film fans as the priest in Rossellini&apos;s OPEN CITY. The movie won the first prize at the Venice Film Festival.

But it seemed that after Joe Johnston filmed these two or three well thought out portions, the rest of the film was just filler.\n\nI caught myself looking at my watch a few times, just sort of wanting the movie to end - and this was at the 1/2 point of the film. The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that &quot;edge of my seat&quot; feeling as the characters faced peril.\n\nAll in all, an above-average film which could have been great if someone with better directing chops had been chosen.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Shelter has dealt with an unfair start into cinemas, it was ready for release way back in 2010 and now it&apos;s finally being released On Demand and in limited theaters under its new title 6 Souls. The movie starts with the introduction of Cara Harding, a female forensic psychiatrist played by Julianne Moore, who just finished wrapping up her current case, when her father Dr. Harding approaches her with a new case. Cara is hesitant at first but soon agrees to take the job and soon discovers that not only does her new patient has multiple personalities but all of them are murder victims, we are then taken on a tailspin with her to figure out why this is happening.\n\nThe movie has its moments of grotesque eeriness that gets under your skin but just not a lot of scares or action. The story just gets lost in its own complexity of twists with not much payoffs. For a movie that is almost 2 hours long it just didn&apos;t accomplish that much or had any moments that stood out to me. The film does have a lot of spooky imagery with creepy locations, but just didn&apos;t take full advantage of them. The film starts off well as a psychological thriller and character study, and then when the horror elements seep in, the film&apos;s effectiveness fades away and becomes illogical. \n\nThe intense and focused performances are where this film shines. Julianne Moore can do any role justice and in this problematic film she proves it with her raw emotions and mesmerizing red head beauty. Julianne plays Cara Harding, a forensic psychiatrist who picks up the most challenging cases of her career when she meets her new patient who has a multiple personality disorder. Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives a captivating performance as David/Adam/Wesley and is probably the very best I&apos;ve seen from him so far. Jonathan&apos;s performance could have been an over the top mess if approached the wrong way, but he made it organic and gripping to watch. The supporting actors were not half bad either and also made it watch able.\n\nDirectors, MÃ¥ns MÃ¥rlind and BjÃ¶rn Stein prove that maybe two heads aren&apos;t that better than one to tackle a flawed story. They do create a certain atmosphere that evokes fear and some stomach turning images but didn&apos;t really know how to end the story effectively or answer all of our questions. Writer, Michael Cooney seems to have made the same mistakes here that he did with his other screenplay Identity, which also had a great start but ruined it for me with it&apos;s lousy last half that was also illogical, his stories are just uneven to me, but I do like his effort for trying to bring something different to this mostly unoriginal genre.\n\nOverall, I can see why they waited so long to release the film, but it deserves a much better treatment than the crap like Texas Chainsaw 3D, which made its way to movie theaters way to easily than this. The film lacks scares, thrills and the story leads to no payoff, but the performances are solid, the atmosphere, imagery are spooky and the concept is a nice change of pace. The movie as a whole could have been so much better and executed with a more terrifying impact, but it&apos;s a whole lot more decent than what it got treated as, so it&apos;s granted at least one viewing if you want something different from the norm. Just don&apos;t expect too much from this one.",

It&apos;s basically a very decent version of &apos;Hostel&apos; with a couple of thugs on the run from riot-torn Paris who seek refuge at a seedy hotel, unbeknownst what lies ahead. It&apos;s not a great film by any means but it is a thrilling one. The lead actress did a great job, but there&apos;s also good stuff the actor who played Farid and the actor who played the meathead lunatic. Its style is slick, just what I enjoy watching. Fans of the genre will know what to expect, others may not. But I recommend &apos;Frontier(s) for a mind-f*ck of a night. ***/*****",

      "reviewBody": "Alraune is a 1930 German film with elements of science fiction and drama. The story follows a scientist, Privy Councillor ten Brinken, who discovers how to create artificial life, which is basically artificial insemination. After successfully creating dozens of &quot;artificial rats&quot;, ten Brinken&apos;s ambition drives him to attempt to create an &quot;artificial human&quot;. The Privy Councillor then raises his creation under the guise of an adopted niece.\n\nAlraune has a fascinating plot and is a great example of an early science fiction film. The first act will draw you in as your imagination runs wild wondering could possibly happen next. The words used to send ten Brinken to conduct such an experiment, &quot;Do you want someone else to beat you to it?&quot; is an excellent motivation for the character. This removes some of the malice from his deeds and adds a tragic element to the whole affair. Wanting to be the best is a motivation anyone can relate to, especially when it is related to work or academia. But how far will you go to achieve such heights?\n\nDespite how interesting the first act is, the film slows to a boring halt afterward. By the end of the movie, it is unclear exactly what the conflict of the story was. You would think that the bulk of the premise would be the main character&apos;s conflict with her identity, or something related. Or perhaps diving further into the Privy Councillor&apos;s other &quot;expensive experiments&quot;. Instead, something intriguing happens in the beginning of the story, and that&apos;s really all there is to it. The film starts very strong but begins to atrophy after the first few scenes. There are a few spots of bad acting, but not enough to ruin a scene. For example, you may see the &quot;stink- eye&quot; or &quot;hands-on- hips&quot; type of overacting from a few of the supporting characters. Lastly, I found it difficult to keep track of which character was which. There is little character development before the film leaps forward seventeen years, leaving the viewer somewhat confused in the new setting.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, Alraune is an intriguing film. The first act is fantastic, not to mention how interesting some of the scientific ideas are. There are many fun directions the film can go after the third act, leaving you with plenty of thriller/science fiction ideas of your own. Anyone interested in these genres will find plenty to like in this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Invercargill, New Zealand, is noted for being the country&apos;s southernmost city and for having the least hours of sunshine and the most number of rain days of any NZ large town. It is also famous for being the home town of a gritty old codger called Burt Munroe who set a number of world motor cycle speed records (one of which still stands) in the 1960s at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, riding a 1920 Indian Scout motor cycle.\n\nRoger Donaldson, one of the midwives to the renaissance of the Kiwi film industry in the 1980s (&quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, &quot;Smash Palace&quot;) and latterly Hollywood director (&quot;Thirteen Days&quot;), made &quot;Offerings to the God of Speed&quot; a documentary on Burt in 1972, when he was still alive. This dramatization of the same story Â little man triumphs though sheer grit and determination Â is a triumph for his star. Anthony Hopkins is good at quirky curmudgeons but here he manages to exude a little homespun charm as well. His Burt has the happy knack of getting people to help him rather than shaft him. Officialdom melts at his approach and he is even attractive to the ladies, as Burt would have put it. It&apos;s Tony Hopkin&apos;s film and he carries it off in fine style. I&apos;m not sure about the accent which is more northern British than southern NZ but it hardly matters as the Americans in the film can scarcely understand it anyway.\n\nThe rest of the cast were all adequate and Aaron Murphy as Tom the kid from next door was actually able to steal some scenes. I also noticed an old acquaintance in a minor role as Frank the bike club president - Tim Shadbolt, student radical of the late 60s and now mayor of Invercargill. Burt had no money but he did get community support at various times, so Invercargillians can take some pride in his achievements.\n\nWhich brings me to what I think is the hole in this account. The Indian motorcycle, which was a light machine used for dispatch and scout work in World War One, had a top speed, according to the makers, of 57 mph. It had a V-2 cylinder block design and a decent capacity of just under 1000cc. Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it, even casting his own pistons, which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped, but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn&apos;t tell him, or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn&apos;t have taken much to explain it.\n\nAs others have said, this is very much a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie and I think, as an ex-resident of NZ, evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character Â the optimism, the friendliness, the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge, and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill, a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in (though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds). But he also had some home-grown attributes as well. .",

No complexity of those days are properly covered, but some fighting scenes are shown. The film does correctly acknowledge the exclusion of the complexity of the situation in the end credits.\n\nNamibia is now a proud democratic nation and a peaceful country, devoid of its previous conflicts.",

This is a decent modern SF production. No one should be disappointed. Obviously, the production team seem to kept it up within the given budget and gave us a timely well paced, nicely trimmed script and eye-lubricated product for every SF lover out there. Of course, one shouldn&apos;t expect some &quot;eye soul candy&quot; nor genre-breaking original ideas (as genre in general, not only within movies, but also games or literature). But, as I noticed above about briefness, we all should be satisfied within the given parameters. A recommendation.",

      "reviewBody": "Stefek (Damian UI) is a bright and very observant six-year-old boy who lives with his teenage sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak) and their mother (Iwona Fornalczyk) in a Polish village outside of Warsaw. Stefan has never seen his father (Tomasz Sapryk) who abandoned the family before he was born but thinks he recognizes him from a defaced picture in his wallet as the man boards a train each morning. Andrzej Jakimowski&apos;s Tricks is one of those rare films that you wish would never end. Winner of the Europa Cinemas prize at the Venice Film Festival, it is a delightful blend of sensitivity, intelligence, humor, and magical realism that transforms the simple truths of childhood into cinematic poetry.\n\nThe title does not refer to &quot;turning tricks&quot;, magic shows, or being bamboozled. It is about the idea, not really a trick at all, that so-called fate can be bended to our will and Jakimowski, who studied Philosophy at the University of Warsaw, makes a very convincing case for the power of intention. The film comments on contemporary small town life in Poland as it moves from one vignette to another in an almost documentary-like manner. Elka has taught Stefek how to &quot;bribe&quot; fate, believing that it can be manipulated. All that is necessary, she thinks, is to declare your purpose and sit back and watch the universe comply. Stefek, on the other hand, thinks that you have to take concrete action rather than merely observing.\n\nTo prove his point, he crumbles a burger wrapper and throws it neatly into the garbage bin at the park. Elka, however, simply places the wrapper on the ground near the bin and watches as it is passed from the owner of a hungry dog to a homeless man and then into the trash without her doing a thing. In another scene, Stefek comes to the aid of an ignored apple seller by buying some of his apples and hopefully setting an example for others. She tries a different way and succeeds. Fascinated by his sister&apos;s powers, Stefek sets out to inform fate that he wants his father back and is willing to use any means at his disposal to accomplish that including toy soldiers, Elka&apos;s auto-mechanic boyfriend Jerzy (Rafal Guzniczak), coins that he throws on the railroad tracks, and a flock of pigeons.\n\nElka denies that the man Stefek identifies is really their father and refuses to become involved in the boy&apos;s plans, being too busy washing dishes at a restaurant, studying Italian, and concentrating on getting a job with an Italian businessman. Jakimowski has coaxed outstanding performances from his mainly non-professional cast and the film reaches a level of authenticity and poetry that is rare for a director making only his second feature. Relationships are affectionate especially the one that young Stefek strikes up with the man at the train station, ultimately devising a scheme to try and bring him back to his mother&apos;s grocery shop. Supported by cinematographer Adam Bajerski&apos;s stunning close-ups and wide-street shots and a pitch perfect score by Tomasz Gassowski, Tricks is a genuinely moving film that may just bribe fate to make it a contender for Best Foreign Film at next year&apos;s Oscars.",

Nevertheless, it fails on every other level, horror, suspense, artistic... whatever. It&apos;s not scary at all. The characters are dull and one dimensional, the story is uninteresting. I was so bored during the stupid thing. All these After Dark horror movies are the same. Still better than Fangoria Frightfest (which all are GOD AWFUL). Give me Piranha 3D over this tripe. At least stuff happens in that movie, and I only waste 83 minutes or whatever. If you have insomnia, rent this movie. It will get you to sleep, trust me. It got me to sleep three times. I finally finished it on the fourth. Oh, and the woman&apos;s voice will drive you nuts.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s always a danger in bringing comic book heroes to the screen in that most are pretty bad.  Some are satisfying, e.g., the Batman and Superman films come to mind.  But, the Phantom was essentially a strip comic by Lee Falk that I used to read as a kid and which had been around long before me (I&apos;ll be 65 this year).  I remember seeing the serial at the Saturday morning matinees and loved the comic strip.  Time passes and the Phantom faded and then, in 1993, I went to Somalia as a consultant during the UNITAF occupation and was billeted with the Aussies.  To my amazement, I discovered the Phantom was not only alive and well Down Under, but there were active comic books cults, conventions and the like there as well.  So, no wonder the film enjoyed a revival of a defunct strip but, alas, there is much to be desired in the effort and the final product is almost a parody of the original.  My wife and I saw it for a bargain matinee and I enjoyed it. However, I suffer few illusions that it could not have been done better.  It was a romp and maybe, as one reviewer noted, Catherine Zeta-Jones was worth the price of admission.  Well, for my part, I liked young Billy Zane&apos;s Phantom with the sheepish grin, Treat Williams&apos;s sardonic evil smile and Christy Swanson&apos;s Diana, a pleasant departure from her Vampire staking role as Buffy.  It was also good to see Patrick McGoohan, former Secret Agent Man as the Phantom&apos;s predecessor. I think this film is worth the price of a rental for a rainy afternoon.",

      "reviewBody": "Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.\n\nTokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the &quot;It&apos;s Fast and the Furious, what do you expect&quot; carpet. The story follows American &quot;teenager&quot; Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival&apos;s girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing&apos;s drifting scene.\n\nI say &quot;teenager&quot; as that&apos;s what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movieÂ but honestly, he&apos;s the oldest teen I&apos;ve ever seen. Along with every other &quot;teen&quot; in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don&apos;t mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn&apos;t present!\n\nBut, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: &quot;It&apos;s not about the ride, it&apos;s about the rider&quot;) from Sean&apos;s fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han&apos;s closet of skeletons. The villain isn&apos;t ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious &quot;king of a little hill&quot; problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.\n\nThere&apos;s no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.",

French cinema is still a safe bet for watching quality movies, and obviously, Jean Becker, is one of the greatest directors. This film talks about a man who starts to change his own life suddenly. In a few hours we&apos;ll see how a man is tired of his own life, acts like he was insane with family and friends and all he wants is disappear and stop to being tired and bored. It must not be easy to represent this self-destructive man without falling into parody or into an absurd sense of humor what we&apos;ll see him with a constant sensation of uncomfortableness. And what about the last half hour. I cannot explain because this film deserves to watch without knowing too much about the plot, but there&apos;s pure cinema in it. Good acting, good scriptwriting and specially, an excellent direction. This films deserves to watch it quietly, without rush. A must see.",

Birju played by Dutt is the more flamboyant one who gets in trouble with the village Lala&apos;s daughter and runs away and becomes a dacoit. The end is the most unexpected part of the movie.\n\nMade on a large canvas, this movie runs like an epic. This Mehboob Khan&apos;s effort came very close to winning the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. During the shooting of this film Dutt saved Nargis from a fire and soon after that they were married.\n\nNaushad&apos;s music is another highlight of the film with some great songs like &quot;Duniya Mein Hum Aaye Hain&quot;, &quot;Nagri-Nagri Dware-Dware&quot;, &quot;Holi Aayi Re Kanhai&quot;, &quot;Tan Rang Lo Ji&quot; etc.\n\nAll in all, this is possibly one of the best Hindi films ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. \n\nI bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and I napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat each lost scene. However, the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button, to end this crap faster. My vote is one.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Cidade Sombria&quot; (&quot;Dark City&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I felt it I know that the &quot;After Dark Horrorfest&quot; often do really bad horror films that are just clichÃ©d with very little interesting characters or action. The only exception being the mesmerising &quot;Frontier(s)&quot;. Obviously &quot;Seconds Apart&quot; is no where near the standard of &quot;Frontier(s)&quot; but it is a very interesting, watchable and enjoyable film! I would very happily watch &quot;Seconds Apart&quot; again, just for it&apos;s pure bravery to go beyond the conventional slasher or ghost story and create quite a complex blend of narrative and characters.\n\nJust imagine Jedward but even more terrifying. Even though I am convinced that this is probably what Jedward get up to and I&apos;m pretty sure that if john or Edward got a girlfriend they would end up killing each other. But anyway, getting away from the point! The twins are really interesting characters to have to front the film. They are the protagonists but pure evil. They&apos;re performances are really chilling and they are well-written characters which is nice to see. Geroge Richards (the writer) manages to make them completely unlikable and likable at the same time. they&apos;re fascinating! Unfortunately the burnt black cop isn&apos;t quite so interesting as the boys and his story, although complex and well thought out is unnecessary and quite annoying.\n\n&quot;Seconds Apart&quot; is directed like a music video. It&apos;s got almost too much style with lots of cuts and fades to black and jump cuts that can be quite off-putting but also quite nice to see. I know I&apos;m not making any sense but I did quite like the mad-cap editing in some places. It was obviously well thought-out and broke away from the boring static conventions which we find in every single horror film! The cinematography was really excellent though and the set-pieces such as the twins creepy old house were really well done.\n\nAlthough the story was OK I couldn&apos;t help but feel it could&apos;ve gone better. I think I would&apos;ve preferred to have seen more drama and sibling rivalry when Jonah or Seth (can&apos;t tell &apos;em apart!) got a girlfriend because I found that prospect really interesting. However instead they decided to focus much more on the detective getting closer to them which was exciting but not as interesting. I think the fight seen at the end of the film could&apos;ve been better also.\n\nThe score and music in general was really well done here, it&apos;s got a creepy edge to it and is memorable. Overall (especially me actually being a twin) it was quite a creepy and fascinating insight. With stylish direction, thoughtful writing and glorious characters! With some tweaks this could&apos;ve been a really great film, but is instead just a really good film. But oh well, it was fun and although there could&apos;ve been a little more gore the deaths were disturbing and creative anyways. I&apos;m giving it a very solid 7 out of 10 which is definitely leaning more towards the 8 side. Definitely worth a watch.",

So, I&apos;ll just make a few notes about what&apos;s good in it:\n\n\n* The movie is based on H.P. Lovecraft and, although this is one of the worst adaptations, Lovecraft is still Lovecraft, and it is very hard to destroy it so much to be unwatchable.\n\n\n\n* Dancer Katrin Alexandre and team that takes credits for the look of The Unnamable did an excellent job and made one of the best monsters in the history of cinematography. Unfortunately, it&apos;s shown in its full glory just briefly.\n\n\n\n* Few moments of naked Laura Albert.\n\n\nEverything else is mediocre and boring, so I recommend this only to the most hardcore fans of Lovecraft and &apos;80s B-production horrors. For the rest of average audience this is just another crap.\n\n5/10",

There are many underground musicians that either contributed musically or artistically. Also, it focuses on a major issue that existed among the &quot;perestroika youth&quot;. How to choose a life of honesty and civility, when corruption promises &quot;white mountains&quot;. Who can we trust if not our government? What will be the future, what is important in a life? These are all the questions that this movie focuses on.\n\nAssa is a film for and by the youth and by the counter culture of its time. Aside from relevant problems being raised in the movie (a rare thing of its time), the film has notable music (that is still remembered and loved today by the grown up counterculture) and hipster style that existed and lived in Soviet Union before it became popular in US.\n\nIf pre-perestroika and the mindset of different people during that time interests you, as well as learning about non-mainstream music and counterculture, this is the movie for you.",

      "reviewBody": "For me Love &amp; Death and Sleeper were Allen&apos;s zenith for slapstick, one-liner comic-gag comedy. After the relatively immature but amusing Bananas &amp; Everything You always Wanted To Know About Sex, Allen goes up a notch in the intellectual comedy stakes to produce this fine send-up of Russian culture &amp; historical caricature.\n\nEven though some of the one-liner jokes don&apos;t always come off it doesn&apos;t matter because you never really get chance to think too much about how droll it is because Allen has another half dozen gags waiting in the wings.\n\nBut I&apos;ve often found that Allen works best when he has a foil for his anarchic humour: and thank the Lord he managed to find the wonderful talent of Ms Keaton. She may not be his intellectual equal but she can run him to ground in nearly everything else. She has a kind of naive charm in this movie, always daydreaming, never really listening to Allen&apos;s mutterings &amp; jabberings. And with this naivity brings warmth, humility and a general sense of well being.\n\nAt the same time Allen can release all his pentup emotions, fears, neo-neurosis to Keaton knowing full well that she wouldn&apos;t have a single notion as to what he was on about.\n\nAnd thats what makes this partnership so durable whether it be here in Love &amp; Death, or Sleeper, Annie Hall or Manhattan Murder Mystery. The scripts may vary but they&apos;re held together by the spontaneity of the two stars.\n\nIt should be said also that Love &amp; Death breaks new ground for Allen, because even though he still relies on the childish humour of his earlier films, it is also quite clear that he is more forthcoming with his angst against a problematic world. His philosophic nuances dominate a lot of the film, which he will put to more practical use in his latter films like Annie Hall &amp; Manhattan. But here he gets the mix between jokes &amp; existentualism just right.\n\nLove &amp; Death is quite literally a laugh a minute. Whatever people may say about his recent personal problems it cannot be denied that this guy is a pure talent and should be cherished for what he is - a man that makes the world a happier place, if only for a few hours!\n\n****/*****",

Breathtaking cinematography and cunning script writing make this a must-see for all who aspire to create &quot;films&quot; rather than movies.  Dona Spier (grossly ignored by the academy) spews forth her lines with an enthusiasm unseen since the great Shakespearean actresses of the 18th century.  Andy Sidaris is a shrewd judge of talent and is horribly underestimated, as his films are usually ignored at the Cannes and Aspen film festivals.  I rate this a 10."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Goose Girl&quot; is a live-action adaption of a lesser known Grimm fairy tale. Filmed in West Germany in 1957, it was imported to the U.S by Childhood Productions, then a thriving distribution company who made their mark re-dubbing and releasing foreign made fairy tale features to kiddie matinÃ©es. This is another of their best ones. A beautiful princess is betrothed to the prince of a neighboring kingdom, and when the time comes, she sets out with a small entourage to wed him. She is given a magic handkerchief by her mother, which she is told will protect her, along with a talking horse. Before she departs, her mother entrusts her to the care of her chambermaid, who promises to look after her. Unknown to the queen, however is the fact that the chambermaid desires the prince for herself, and has been concocting an evil plan to accomplish her ends. With the reluctant help of two bumbling servants, the chambermaid deprives the princess of the magic handkerchief, and tricks her into changing places with her, swearing her to secrecy. Once they arrive at the palace, the maid is taken for the princess, who becomes a goose girl. But, of course, the story does not end there... The production is beautifully atmospheric, the new music and songs written for the American release are lovely, as is the princess. A very satisfying fairy tale film, and one that deserves to be better known.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Daybreakers&apos; at Piccadilly today. Been curious ever since i saw the trailers and being an Ethan Hawke fan decided to check it out anyway. The film started out on a bloody brilliant note. The scenes conveying the near-extinction of the human race and how the vampires are taking over and how the vampires themselves are threatened by the blood shortage issue was done rather effectively and the audience seemed to love it. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the film which can be expected in the genre, but nevertheless is very vital to it as most films fall short here. Daybreakers is not your typical clichÃ©-ridden vampire horror. There has obviously been some sensible writing involved here. But towards the end the screenwriter tends to lose his grip and throws in some regular scenes just for the sake of cheap thrills and gore. This for me did take a bit away from the essence of the film especially considering the rest of the film was great,\n\nBut nevertheless I would recommend this film, as there is much to be enjoyed. The cinematography and colour combos and contrasts have been created masterfully. Even most of the cgi seems credible enough. Ethan Hawke is his usual intense self and Sam Neil re-surfaces into the mainstream with a Batman-sounding villain character. But its William Defoe as one of &quot;the folks with the cross-bows&quot; who gets the best lines in the film. Sample this- &quot; a human in a world of vampires is about as safe as barebacking a five dollar whore!&quot;\n\nCould have been a great vampire flick, a genre defining one, but is reduced to merely a good one. But that isn&apos;t too bad considering the amount of vampire dung we were dished out for the entirety of 09. This one is the best of the lot! Cheers",

      "reviewBody": "Fruhlingsinfonie &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; (1983): Starring Nastassia Kinski, Herbert Gronemeyer, Rolf Hoppe, Andre Heller, Marie Colbin, Margit Geissler, Gidon Kemer, Inge Marschall, Kitty Matern, Uwe Muller, Peter Schamoni&apos;s 1983 German film &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; is an intimate, accurate portrayal of the relationship between two composers- Robert Schumann and Clara. It is a wonderful film, with fine acting by the leads Herbert Gronemeyer and Natassia Kinksi, who had been a model and would enjoy further success after this movie. The time is early 19th century (1830-1850)during the Romantic Era craze in classical music. Beethoven opened the gates to the new wave of music, which would be followed by Chopin and Franz Liszt, all mentioned in this film. Robert Schumann is portrayed here as a struggling artist, an idealist who lives from hand to mouth, more along the lines of Mozart. He gets romantically involved with the more wealthier and polished Clara Wieck whose father opposes their love. Even like this, Robert and Clara, who had become lovers through working together as composers, continue to defiantly engage in their relationship. Clara&apos;s father is brought to trial but in the end Clara and Robert are married. The film is accurate, and not highly dramatized or romanticized far from the truth. Filmed in Germany, Austria and France, the film follows the career of Schumann quite truthfully - i.e: the fact he was injured and his fingers were paralized and even as such played the piano quite well, his publication of a music magazine under the pen names of Eusebius and Florestan. Eusebius is his practical, balanced side while Florestan is passionate and free-spirited. A beautiful film. Natassia Kinksi plays a fine Clara, strong, independent, refined, romantic, soulful. The costumes and attention to detail are precise, captivating us and hooking us into a new world of historical romance.\n\nMy favorite scenes are those romantic moments between Clara and Robert, the opening scene with Paganini playing a violin concerto with lightning speed, all the chamber music scenes and recitals Clara has and the finale in which finally, Clara and Robert have married and decide to open their own concert hall..Robert says &quot;I hope this institution is big enough for two instruments&quot; and I think he was referring to their marriage. The music is heaven. Conductor Wolgfang Sawallisch leads his orchestra in brilliant music by both Robert Schumann and Clara.",

Very different too.\n\nAnd yes if you like it, you will state that this is good because it isn&apos;t like any Hollywood movie (well it&apos;s not supposed to be). And yes it has it&apos;s scenes (though the staircase montage gets a bit annoying after a bit). And also yes to the fact, that this is not really a horror movie. It is more a sci-fi movie than a horror movie. Just in case you expected that, from the man who brought you Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original that is).\n\nIf you are into experimental movies with (almost) no story at all, than this might be for you.

      "reviewBody": "Taking advantage of the enormous publicity from the small screen when cast members Ryan O&apos;Neal and Leigh Taylor-Young became a small screen Dick and Liz, they were cast in The Big Bounce. Both were cast in roles suitable to each other, but Leigh made far more of it than Ryan.\n\nO&apos;Neal is a rather quick tempered drifter who is a Vietnam veteran and doing farm labor work for lack of something better. It also fits the unsettled character of his nature. As the film opens he&apos;s in trouble having stabbed one of the migrants, a fellow known for a nasty temper and the fact he was reputed to carry a knife.\n\nKnowing all that the local town judge Van Heflin persuades the prosecutor to drop the whole thing and Heflin offers room, board, and a job at his motel. But O&apos;Neal finds something Heflin can&apos;t compete with in the intriguing and sexy mantrap Leigh Taylor-Young.\n\nMaybe Carroll Baker in Baby Doll made a sexier big screen debut, but she&apos;s the only one I can think of. Taylor-Young is a child of the Sixties. She&apos;s the kept mistress of Robert Webber manager of the pickle works and the biggest employer in the area. She&apos;s also one spoiled rotten and dangerously psychotic woman. What Taylor-Young is is all about kicks, getting them wherever she can.\n\nThe question is will O&apos;Neal who isn&apos;t the strongest of characters be able to resist this woman and the dangerous things she does just to get what she calls The Big Bounce.\n\nThe Big Bounce is an inauspicious debut for O&apos;Neal who would really hit it big shortly with Love Story. But it did guarantee him a lengthy career. But Mrs. O&apos;Neal really runs away with this picture as the kind of woman that ought to come with a warning label.",

The objective of the lying game is to avoid suspicious, manipulate the friends and eliminate the enemies. The group decides to play a prank in all the mates of the high school, using a recent unsolved murder of a student in the campus. They send e-mails to all colleagues describing fake crimes with the same characteristics of the young woman committed by a serial killer called &quot;The Wolf&quot;. Their teacher Rich Walker (Jon Bon Jovi) advises Owen how serious this joke could be. When the students of their group start to disappear, Owen, Dodger and Tom realize that the criminal became real.\n\n&quot;Cry_Wolf &quot;was a great surprise for me, being an entertaining tale of manipulation. The engaging story has many unpredictable twists and a surprising conclusion. The promising teen cast has great performances, highlighting the gorgeous Lindy Booth, Julian Morris and Jared &quot;Supernatural&quot; Padalecki, besides the name of Jon Bon Jovi. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Cry_Wolf: O Jogo da Mentira&quot; (&quot;Cry_Wolf: The Lying Game&quot;)",

I guess if you want to get into the movie biz you have to start somewhere, but would it hurt to know how to use a camera and a microphone first? Just a suggestion. And why set a movie in the future when you can&apos;t afford the props to make it work? While at the end of the day I&apos;d rather watch a piece of trash like this than any newer movie or TV show, there&apos;s no denying that this effort is a fail in pretty much every respect and could have been a lot better if the people who put it together had some idea of what they were doing.

      "reviewBody": "By the fourth Lex Barker entry into the Tarzan series things were more or less established, and though the new adventures had become almost routine, the efficiency evidenced in the previous films was still maintained. The new additions here are a surrogate for Boy called Joey, played very well by a kid whose only film this was; and a fourth actress playing Jane, pretty Dorothy Hart. The Cold War shadow is still present in this production, with a Russian villain named Rokov (Austrian-born actor Charles Korvin), who wants to get hold of the diamonds of an African tribe. As in &quot;Tarzan&apos;s Peril&quot; a murder happens in the first minutes, leading to the impersonation of Lord Greystoke, Tarzan&apos;s cousin, by the villain&apos;s weak colleague (Patrick Knowles), and Jane convincing Tarzan to help them. Here Cheetah&apos;s compulsive stealing is also a main ingredient of the plot, and little Joey also plays a key role in the proceedings. Considered by some specialists as one of the best Tarzan movies, it was directed by Cy Endfield, an American left-wing filmmaker who had a promising career but when blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, he went to England in 1951, where he made television, advertisement and a few good films as &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot; and &quot;Zulu&quot; before retiring and inventing the Microwriter. Possibly it was Endfield who introduced several &quot;sleight-of-hand routines&quot;, performed on screen by Rokov, who uses them to trick gullible natives. Known as a &quot;master of the art of micro magic&quot;, Endfield had worked in Orson Welles&apos; Mercury Theatre. Last but not least, this is probably the only Tarzan movie to include two black-listed film professionals: Endfield and Korvin.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1972, This is the Mexican version of &quot;The night of the living dead&quot; Professor Zovek was a real national hero. He was an authentic athlete, able to swim, jump the boxer&apos;s rope and perform sit-ups without stopping for more than 8 hours. He became famous for his escapes (better than Houdini&apos;s) and his demonstrations of his physical and mental strength, like stopping 8 motorcycles from start running using his teeth, a biting device and some chains (everything documented on TV and WITH audience in the studio). \n\nThe Fuji Telecasting Company LTD from Japan sent some agents to Mexico to invite the Professor for a special program &quot;The World Surprise Show&quot; where super stunts, strong men and extraordinary talented people were presented every six months having the best of the best in this Show, when they heard about Zovek, they thought it was like the &quot;Zovek brothers&quot; where one was an escape artist, another probably making the records an maybe another being the professional hypnotist etc. but they were surprised when realize that the Professor was everything in one man, so they called him and gave him the title of &quot;The first Incredible Showman in the world&quot;.\n\nWith this we can understand why the producers of this movie the &quot;Rosas Priego&quot; brothers offered Zovek a contract of 9 movies, because they knew that success was guaranteed, at least in the local market.\n\nYes, this is a low budget film and the special effects are nothing if you compare those to Terminator&apos;s or Matrix&apos;s, but this is early 70&apos;s. Look for example the movies of that time like 007&apos;s or Roller Ball and you won&apos;t find Silicon Graphics style at all. In the other hand take a look to &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; where you have a superstar, Will Smith; there is a big budget and that was made in 1999 and for real that&apos;s a poor, empty movie.\n\nThe makers of this movie had to re-write the script because Professor Zovek was killed in a helicopter accident in March 1972 so they invited to the wrestling star &quot;Blue Demon&quot; to finish the story, and of course the Professor never saw the movie.\n\nThe fighting scenes looks real because actually The Professor was a Martial Arts Teacher (he trained the Military Police of the Mexican Army and received some offers from some other countries in Eastern Europe) and he mastered western boxing, French fencing and oriental Martial Arts.\n\nWhen the cable TV industry was spreading in Mexico in early 80&apos;s even the next generation of kids enjoyed and cheered Professor Zovek every time they were presenting &quot;La invasion de los muertos&quot; and Professor&apos;s first movie &quot;El Increible Profesor Zovek&quot;. So I know this movie has the power to make a kid to fall in love with it.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched a documentary about Aki Kaurimaki (one of my favourite directors) in which he stated that he was sick and tired of pages and pages of dialogue he had written ending up on the cutting room floor. So he keeps the dialogue to a minimum. This film is a perfect example of this philosophy. This is Kaurismaki&apos;s trademark. Anyone who has seen &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot; or &quot;Arial&quot; will recognise his sparing use of dialogue rather than having characters speak just for the sake of speaking. It is no wonder that his most recent film &quot;Juha&quot; was a silent film.\n\nThis is a very dark and very realistic film about loneliness and depression. All the main characters in the film are lonely people, with very little to live for. Anyone who liked Tom Di Cillo&apos;s &quot;Johnny Suede&quot; will find that this is a very film to &quot;I hired a Contract Killer&quot;. Personally, I loved this film and would highly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for fine art house cinema."

Armande Assante doesn&apos;t have the straight man charisma of Leslie Nielsen, but he&apos;s still more than up for the job. The casting of Sean Young following her bizarre Cat Woman stunt in the early &apos;90s couldn&apos;t fit her role better. A handful of jokes don&apos;t land, but most do.\n\nIf the film has any knocks, it&apos;s that there is almost too much going on at the end. Also, some of the older films being parodied like Chinatown are probably lost on some viewers.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of noir or neo-noir you&apos;ll probably love this, but anyone who enjoys spoofs should also give it a watch.",

This was not logical to me because the harnesses on the sleds were &quot;Eastern Arctic&quot;, not Western Arctic. The Eastern Arctic harness is like a fan, the Western Arctic/Alaskan style is the straight line with two dogs running side by side with a lead dog.\n\nAnother reason is that I adore dogs, and had always asked my father to bring back a Canadian Eskimo Dog (a specific breed) when he traveled north to the Arctic (He refused). \n\nAnd, finally, the cinematography is beautiful. It was a perfect movie to watch with my limited (almost non-existent) Japanese! The images of the landscape have haunted me since that night in Tokushima in 1987.",

It&apos;s much better than ghost movies which just try to terrify people.\n\nMany people will enjoy all the complexity in this movie, while some may feel it&apos;s too complicated as a movie. Especially, people who have engineering background will like this movie a lot.\n\nThe special effect is not as magnificent as the best Hollywood sci-fi movies, but it&apos;s good enough for a ghost related movie.\n\nThe actors are good as well, while they are mostly Asian.\n\nI believe the comment for this movie will be polarized depending on the expectation &amp; background of the watcher.",

      "reviewBody": "Amusing film is packed with intrigue , comedy , tense and especial effects galore , dealing with a Master sorcerer named Balthazar Blake who recruits a seemingly everyday guy in his mission to defend New York City from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath . It starts in 740 A.D., in Britain, the disciple of Merlin Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina) unites forces to the wicked Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige) and betrays his master. However, the other two disciples of Merlin Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage), a descendant from a historical line familiar whose mission was defeat nasty witch and Veronica (Monica Belluci) defeat the evil and Balthazar catches Horvath in a magic recipient and Veronica merges with Morgana and they are seized in another vessel. Along the centuries, Balthazar unsuccessfully seeks out the Prime Merlian, the only sorcerer capable to destroy Morgana, using a dragon ring and he finally finds him in the present days in Manhattan . Balthazar can&apos;t do it alone, so he enlists Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as his reluctant pupil. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It&apos;ll take all the courage Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as he becomes The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice. The young is spontaneously implicated as key on find out the weird events .However the sorcerer&apos;s apprentice is in love with Becky Barnes (Teresa Palmer) and Blake doubts whether he is actually the chosen one .They will take on lots of adventures, risks and confronting a stubborn enemy. The sorcerer and his new friend undergo a chase that take them throughout the N.Y. streets .\n\nThis entertaining movie displays suspense , noisy action, intrigue, humor and extraordinary adventures. The picture blends rip-roaring feats , thrills , mystery and witchery , along with a Walt Disney style . It&apos;s a cinematic roller coaster pretty amusing that have you on the edge of your seat. The tale is silly and laughable but the effects and action are quite well. Among the most spectacular of its visuals there are a metallic eagle , the attack of a sculpture showing a giant bull brought to life and other monsters roaring menacingly towards the camera. Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the excellent visual effects by John Nelson . Stimulating action set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures of ours protagonists with breathtaking final attraction in the scenes of the ultimate confrontation among wizards . Stirring and lively musical score by Trevor Rabin . Cameraman Bojan Bazelli makes a glamorous cinematography though mostly night. The flick is lavishly produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and professionally directed by John Turteltaub (the kid , Phenomenon, While you were sleeping) .Both of them have collaborated in two hits as Â¨National treasureÂ¨ and Â¨National treasure : Book of secretsÂ¨ . The picture will appeal to Nicolas Cage fans and Jerry Brukheimer movies enthusiasts.",

      "reviewBody": "An sequel that is just as good and kick ass as the original! I thought it was more violent and action packed this time around but not overly done because just like in the original it focused on suspense and scares and character development more than gore and torture which is very rare in slashers these days. I thought the acting was just as strong or even better than in the original with our strong, heroine female lead who I think is very sexy, Hollywood should recruit her! There is not one dull moment in this film and is more fast paced than the original but it also has a build up too and is twice as entertaining and thrilling but the things that kept me from giving it a full 5 star rating is that it kind of lost its slasher touch making it more like an action/thriller with an body count and was less scary. The last half was fantastic though and kept me on the edge of my seat and had me rooting for the lead to survive and the film leaves it open for a Cold Prey 3 and I can&apos;t wait! Overall this is the best slasher series I&apos;ve seen since maybe Scream 1 and 2 because to me it&apos;s near perfection when it comes to slasher flicks and I highly recommend it for fans of the genre. More of a 4.5 out of 5 stars. SEE IT ASAP!!! AS WELL AS THE FIRST ONE IF YOU HAVEN&apos;T YET!",

      "reviewBody": "A &quot;modern western&quot;, made in West Germany.  Films of this ilk would leave a 1990s cinema audience completely puzzled.  It can only be understood in the context of a society where cigarette companies were advertising &quot;den Duft der grossen weiten Welt&quot; (the smell of the whole wide world), when movies had gratuitous helicopter shots (that is: shots OF helicopters) to indicate importance, when damsels in distress were abundant in cinema, preferably in tight sweaters, when European cinema still made films that were supposed to entertain an unsophisticated mass audience, etc.\n\nWhat am I squirming about?  Well, we have here a bunch of Mexican bandits played by well-known German actors - they look as Mexican or banditrious as, say, George C. Scott does.  Clearly, the assumption in 1965 was that the intended audience had never seen a Mexican in their lives, or a bandit for that matter - probably a correct assumption.  To be precise, this is only one of the minor flaws of the film, in comparison.  Our willingness to suspend disbelief is overstretched, the plot about three German women captured by Mexican bandits is frankly ludicrous.",

Noteworthy is that there is a 93 minute Dutch edition which seems to be as rare as hens teeth so this review is of the 82 minute Swiss edition from ABCDVD Classics.\n\nThe plot is well thought out with Simone and Gina (Brigitte Lahaie and Lidie Ferdics) the two put-upon maids who plan to get their revenge by matching up the son, Luca with his cousin Fanny but as this is a porn film then there is more than just this. For those who like close-ups of female genitalia, then they should be satisfied but there are missed opportunities for more erotic scenes between Luca and Martha, the older woman, surely every schoolboy&apos;s fantasy. The film benefits by being shot in beautiful locales which all add to the film&apos;s attraction. The tennis court area has since been redeveloped into a tourist establishment. I still think that a little less porn and a bit more erotica would have really been the icing on the cake.",

The fragment of the original work which is all that remains of Petronius&apos; great satire deals mainly with the excesses of Trimalchio&apos;s banquet...and that is fully present here and perhaps even better done. The sequence of the ceiling collapsing dramatically only to surprise the guests with a huge weighty cake is quite priceless, as is the faked death of the host so that everyone has to fawn on the (living) corpse, kissing it in gratitude for it&apos;s largess. Don Backy (who resembles Ray Danton) is really outstanding as Encolpio, the main character. His two comrades who support him in the numerous picaresque escapades are also well drawn and much more sympathetic than the more thuggish protagonists in Fellini&apos;s reading. There is more depth to them and sadness, too, missing in Fellini. If you like the Fellini version, you should definitely see this one, too. It&apos;s every bit as good and in some ways better.",

      "reviewBody": "There are films that never seem to see the light of day and the late 80&apos;s obscure Sci-fi thriller &quot;Stranded&quot; happens to be one. Supposedly from the producers who brought us &quot;Critters&quot; and having the young up and coming star Ione Skye in the cast. I&apos;m surprised that it wasn&apos;t a little more known. Anyhow the idea behind the story is very slight in what is an offbeat siege set-up with an intergalactic twist and while the threat wasn&apos;t inside the house but what was actually happening outside. This meant those sequences dealing with the aliens and their captors were less so interesting compared to the tension-fuelled and confrontational exchanges between the officers, local hicks and the mysterious FBI agent. \n\nTeenager Deidre and her grandmother live in an isolated country house when one night they find themselves held hostage by aliens who escaped their world with an assassin on their trail. The situation becomes worse when a local and police officer are killed leading to a standoff between the aliens and the officers.\n\nAt just over 70 minutes, &quot;Stranded&quot; doesn&apos;t outstay its welcome and it&apos;s rather breezy as it hurries through. Even in that, the film is smart, taut and engrossing. The material is thoughtful and infectious in its themes. Rock solid performances ensure you keep watching. Maureen O&apos;Sullivan, Joe Morton, Cameron Dye and Ione Skye all hold their own. Flea from the &quot;Red Hot Chilli Peppers&quot; plays one of the aliens and so does actress/stunt-woman Spice Williams-Crosby in the most distinctive costume design. Moody visuals are etched by director Tex Fuller, by letting the situation unfold with story development, character sensitivity and suspenseful set-pieces with some limited, but durable optical special effects. \n\n&quot;Anything is possible. I suppose.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "This gripping, unjustly obscure, superbly realized, darkly atmospheric thriller from Hungary is an absolute pip! While, Lajos Fazekas&apos;s moody, consistently compelling &apos;Defekt&apos;(1977) initially appears to take considerable liberties with the ubiquitous cinematic tropes provided by maestro, Robert Bloch&apos;s hugely influential &apos;Psycho&apos;; the excitingly terse narrative herein nonetheless soon settles into a truly idiosyncratic, sparely-written, appealingly taciturn, noirish thriller that makes most excellent use of its slender running time (67 mins approx), and the creepy film&apos;s equally meagre, deliciously oppressive locale is suitably claustrophobic! The assured, creative B/W photography and grimy art direction is uniformly excellent, and the eerie jazzoid score by clearly talented composer, Gyorgy Vukan is a chilling, Lalo Schifrin-style delight! I sincerely found &apos;Defekt&apos; (1977) to be a hugely entertaining downbeat thriller, and I hope that a great many other similarly broad-minded, treasure-seeking Euro-cult cinephiles will also get a chance to appreciate this offbeat macabre masterpiece of Hungarian, jazz-fuelled terror!",

It&apos;s hard to sympathize with these youths because they seem too arrogant, and also unbelievably naive at times. As for the story, it doesn&apos;t seem to know where it&apos;s going. First we see the youths struggle, then we see them get involved with a big plan, then their subsequent escape, then... well, the movie after that point has even less of a clue what to do. To top it off, there&apos;s no real ending. The &quot;joy&quot; comes from the producers who took ticket-buyers on a &quot;ride&quot; - though I doubt this sold many tickets."

The film deals with a heist pulled off by thieves posing as Elvis impersonators during a convention, and their following dillemas afterwards. The film becomes fairly predictable and unbelievable in the ensuing chaos, as most of the action takes place in showdowns between Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner&apos;s characters, the latter of whom claims to be an illegitimate child of Elvis. I thought it was a pretty good movie, and you might find something you like in it.\n\n** 1/2 out of ****"

Many of them show the will not to just simply  go on like nothing happened but to search for new forms of entertainment in the light of the  war and the guilt of the german people. &quot;Film ohne Titel&quot; (Film Without a Title) is an interesting reflection about  the rights to be entertained: Which stories can be told, when all stories seem to have been finished? It shows the attempts of a film crew to shoot a film. They offer several versions of one simple love story in different film form (melodrama or german expressionism) until they come out with the right form (which is this film itself).  The film is entertaining and modern as well. Unfortunately questions of film form were not to be touched again until the seventies."

      "reviewBody": "Kismet (1943) : Brief Review -\n\nThe First Ever Achivement of Indian Cinema in Repeat Value and Commercial Blockbuster films. Kismet was the first Indian film to become a commercial blockbuster and numbers wise the first film to cross 1cr at Indian Box Office therefore watching this film becomes mandatory for a movie buff. It clears very much about the quality of Indian Cinema of that time and when did these all commercial formulas began. It is important to know what kind of films Indian cinema was making in early 40s when Hollywood was at top with Legendary Films like &apos;Casablanca&apos;, &apos;The Maltese Falcon&apos;, &apos;The Grapes Of Wrath&apos;, &apos;Citizen Kane&apos; etc. Obviously Indian cinema was far behind but not that far, we couldn&apos;t make high quality products like those legendary films mentioned but it was about making something on our own level, something suitable and acceptable for our audience and something which is relatable and set in our culture and Kismet proved it. Kismet is deservingly that evergreen commercial blockbuster in mainstream cinema which will always be remembered for being an inspiration and influential classic to all the filmmakers. An excellent writing by Aghajani Kashmeri was far ahead of it&apos;s time. It gave birth to so many characterisations and storytelling tricks which have been used again and again in Indian Cinema and will be used forever. That lost and found formula, that bad rascal hero turning into good soul for the naive heroine, rich parents accepting poor daughter-in-law and even those supporting actors helping the narrative strongly etc. It all started with Kismet. Such a Blockbuster writing it is. Every character is perfectly written and wisely linked to each other and even to the backdrop. Ashok Kumar plays a thief Shekhar/Madan with his own Swag. That attitude while smoking cigar and taking all situations so lightly yet confidently is just wow. Mumtaz Shanti was pretty melodramatic and sober, V. H. Desai is hilarious and Shah Nawaz is suitable in Inspector&apos;s role. Music is well composed and must have worked for that era but &apos;Hindostan Hamara Hai&apos; deserves a special mention. This patriotic song was picturised just after national events like &apos;August Revolution&apos; and &apos;Chale Jao&apos; in British India, can you imagine how path-breaking it was? Dialogues are crunchy, cinematography is good and Direction of Gyan Mukherjee is Fantastic. Kismet is India&apos;s First Commercial Blockbuster but more importantly it is India&apos;s First ever Achivement in Repeat Value films. Overall, A Timeless Blockbuster !\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest",

He actually didnÂ´t have to help all of those people, but he chose to do it anyway. I donÂ´t know how much fiction there is in this movie, but if almost everything is true, I must say that I really admire Edelstam. He inspires me to be a better human.\n\nI donÂ´t know how many languages Edelstam spoke. But he must have spoken Spanish. I would have liked to hear more Swedish and Spanish. There wasnÂ´t much of those languages. &quot;The Black Pimpernel&quot; mostly uses English. But it would have been more logic to mostly use Swedish and Spanish.\n\nSome scenes could also have included a bit more clarity. And where is EdelstamÂ´s wife and children? It would have been interesting to see them. I can recommend this movie. It made a truly memorable impression on me.",

Some scenes are quite violent and gory, including depictions of dismembered body parts and brain splatterings. There are some hilarious moments that are perhaps more funny because the movie is otherwise quite serious. The main actor (Statham) plays his role well and has an edge about him that comes off as real. He had some nice banter with his homosexual boss, but thankfully there wasn&apos;t any suggestion of any sexual tension between the two (not because I&apos;m homophobic, but because I think it would distract from the action too much.) The rest of the cast was average. The deranged killer was neither scary nor psychotic and I didn&apos;t get the feeling that he was really on a killing spree. I guess the bar of the deranged killer was set by the Joker from Batman. Overall, a good movie to watch once.",

Only if you can&apos;t get away by pleading your right to an exemption to the traffic cops. Just this time, please. I won&apos;t do it tomorrow.\n\nKiarostami set up shop at one of those intersections and filmed the interaction of one cop with the many drivers trying to enter the restricted zone. The results are predictable. Drivers without permits trying all kind of excuses to get through. The presence of a hospital a block away within the zone justifies a variety of medical excuses. The poor cop seems overwhelmed and in exasperation lets many through in violation of the law. Recidivists are recognized, confronted with yesterday&apos;s promise not to try again, and we are back at square one. Go ahead my fellow citizen, break the law and have a good day.\n\nThe problem with this film is that it goes on for too long. The excuses because repetitive. You keep waiting for some humorous thematic variation, but nothing fresh develops.",

Its subsequent points of interest include the battlefield of war, an affair of the heart, and above all a popular radio broadcast that binds private destinies to an imaginary collective fate. The film features many of Germany&apos;s movie- and show-stars. `Wunschkonzert&apos; is filled with popular (German) songs of the 1930s and 40s and therefore, was a big success with the soldiers on the front.",

Well written and believable characters and good conflict. Sometimes funny, sometimes serious.  The musical numbers are imaginative, though the songs are not the best.  The characters drive the story and keep you interested.  You care what happens to them.  I wish they had made a sequel because I want to see more of these characters and find out what happens next."

Billy, working as a ranch hand, swears revenge on the four men who ambushed and killed his boss.\n\nThat&apos;s about it for plot.  Newman plays Billy well, portraying a man bent on his mission.  One senses that he means well, but his short temper and dark past always get the best of him, even during his friend&apos;s, Pat Garrett (John Dehner in a nice performance), wedding.\n\nUnfortunately, Newman suffers from a weak supporting cast and little character development.  I found it hard to believe that Billy could develop such a strong bond with his boss in such a short time (although the movie doesn&apos;t exactly specify how long).  With the possible exception of Garrett, the remaining players are there to fill up the screen.\n\nIn short, I wasn&apos;t disappointed with this film, but if you want to view a great Western about a man driven by revenge, definitely see John Wayne in The Searchers.",

It is a tremendous film with a deeply unsettling message and even now, 24 hours after seeing it I am haunted by the end.\n\nIt&apos;s a fairy story and nightmare rolled into one. It&apos;s not what happens that&apos;s important it&apos;s how it happens. the story is great but the plot is even better.\n\nForget the bad reviews and make up your own mind. If you subscribe to the notion that Life imitates Art or Art imitates Life go see it. You won&apos;t be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "As I sit and recall all the idiocies of this film, one of the most amusing that I remember is the idea put forth that a person with DID will disguise themselves to look like a different person when one of their alternates come out. In nearly eleven years of knowingly watching these patients switch from personality to personality, I have yet to see this happen. This is before we even get into the fact that Jane March&apos;s behaviour during this film more closely resembles that of a person suffering mania - hypersexuality, paranoia, irrational fear, and so forth.\n\nBruce Willis must also be wondering why he signed up for this stinker. I&apos;m sure the shooting script must have looked wonderful, but a combination of extremely clumsy editing (the sex scenes in the middle of the film are a wonderful example) and poor character development turned this into another Plan 9 From Outer Space. To all of you who gave this turkey positive comments, I ask you to ask yourselves: what psychiatrist in their right mind would see patients in buildings where it is that easy for patients to off themselves? Especially in such a lawsuit-happy society as America? What psychiatrist in their right mind stays back late in their office without carrying a firearm when they know someone is stalking them? Finally, when was the last time you heard of a psychiatrist taking over a group of patients for a friend in the profession when one of them might have murdered him? Oh, and a special note on Ruben Blades&apos; role: even beat police are not that ignorant about psychiatry, an especially important element of their job considering how often they may be confronted by psych patients waving weapons in the middle of an episodic crisis.\n\nAs a veteran of numerous therapy groups, I could not stop laughing at this film. If it had been approached with the intention of making a comedy, then it would have succeeded beyond all expectations. However, the advertising campaign and the babbling tone of the dialogue left me with the general feeling that this film was taking itself WAY too seriously. If you do take yourself that seriously, get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20% that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime (that&apos;s just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher), don&apos;t take yourself so seriously. It&apos;s that simple."

The camera can photograph a huge empty room in a mental hospital and you don&apos;t have to tell us what it feels like. The starkness of the setting is already pretty overwhelming. They are trapped. This is horrifying.\n\nI grew up in the 70s so I&apos;m familiar with this weird weak neurotic snarky tone that everyone has. It was a pretty awful time to live. People were not nice. Negativity was coolness, and everybody just wanted to drop out and let go of everything.\n\nI was really not liking Christopher Walken in the first few minutes but I relaxed and decided to go with it. And here he is an absolutely wonderful actor doing the best with this material. And a lot of his works that we all know about now as an actor show up here.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Der KongreÃ tanzt&quot; is hugely entertaining despite its weak plot and mostly non-descript acting. That is mainly due to the lavish sets and the score. But let&apos;s begin with the beginning. The plot concerns Viennese glove maker Christel (Lilian Harvey), who meets Czar Alexander I (Willy Fritsch) on occasion of the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15. Christel and Alexander fall in love, and complications ensue (in part because the czar has brought a double, also played by Fritsch) that end only with Napoleon&apos;s return from Elba. All this is closely followed by the Austrian chancellor Metternich (Conrad Veidt), who is busy turning the country into a police- and surveillance-state and intends to distract the czar from taking an active role in the congress. Harvey is charming; Fritsch has nothing more to do than look good, and Veidt does well as scheming politician. The sets and costumes are stunning (imagine this in technicolor!), allowing German audiences in 1931 to indulge in their passion for uniforms and the monarchy. But as mentioned above, what makes this film special is the music. There are some tunes that are so catchy that they are popular to this day: I never realised that &apos;Das gibt&apos;s nur einmal&apos; was from this film before watching it last night. The whole scene, where Christel sings this song while riding the carriage out of Vienna into the countryside is utterly enchanting. To summarise: In part this film is obviously fluff intended to distract the viewers from the Great Depression. However, as such, its quality is outstanding. &apos;Der KongreÃ tanzt&apos; works brilliantly.",

There is literally no one like him; Andy Kaufman&apos;s stunts seem like cheap SNL gags in contrast. Even those jaded jades at the Factory are utterly overwhelmed by his aura of sacredness. The other stuff is fun, too, especially a fat guy who does a routine about &quot;Paranoid Schizophrenics for William F. Buckley, Jr.&quot; The one drag: Mario Montez&apos;s trannie dance is interrupted by puke-inducing, Austin Powers-style zooms in and out."

This had one.  LisaRaye gave an impressive debut performance as a college student trying to make ends meet.  Bernie Mac can make the most dramatic piece of dialogue into stand-up comedy with his extraordinary vocal strength and stamina.  I was very impressed with Ice Cube, his writing-directing debut, because, honestly, I didn&apos;t know he was capable.  I like how he staged the scenes and built suspense.  The great thing about it is that there is a considerable amount of violence, but no one is killed.  For once, a black film where everyone lives.  Another thing, this movie has the best, most vicious catfight I have ever seen."

Well we get to see Seagal wield a Katina and go apes**t on a bunch of Japanese criminals, and we get to see him act in a different language, but his fluency in Japanesse has little effect on the overall quality of his performance. It&apos;s just different is all. No folks, Seagal is pretty much the same guy he was ten fifteen years earlier, only he&apos;d getting tiresome. \n\nWith that in mind, If I am gonna recommend one film from the latter Seagal, this might be it. despite It feels a bit more epic than anything he has done in that decade, It has some nice shots, and even features a couple of Seagal&apos;s songs. He ain&apos;t too bad.\n\nThe script could do with a few less clichÃ©d lines, and a few more one liners. Steven Seagal looks pretty bored on screen, and the signs of age are certainly taking their toll, but he ain&apos;t dead yet.",

(If you don&apos;t like the screenplay, you can blame its co-writer: one Andrew Lloyd Webber.) The famous mask here doesn&apos;t hide the fact that Butler is a lot better looking than your average Phantom, and his voice lacks the wide range required by the score---but I found it more realistic, and all told, he does reflect the emotions of a tortured soul who&apos;s lived a lifetime literally in the shadows. The movie is helped by sumptuous sets, the ALWebber score, Emmy Rossum&apos;s singing, and its tale of hopeless love. Purists may sniff, but when the movie opened people in our area went back to see it again. I did. And the dvd is a welcome addition to my collection.",

      "name": "lesser known Polish director Waldemar Krzystek takes up a touchy subject",
      "reviewBody": "Viewed at the 2010 Polish film festival of Los Angeles. A very interesting picture here was Waldemar Krzystek&apos;s latest offering, &quot;Little Moscow&quot; ( MaÅa Moskwa) which takes up the still touchy subject of the stationing of Russian troops on Polish soil during the Cold War years, which amounted almost to a military occupation. The Little Moscow in question was a large Russian garrison near the city of Legnica which was totally off limits to the local Poles, therefore they called it &quot;Mala Moskwa&quot;. Numerous scenes demonstrate the disdain the Russians had for their Polish &quot;allies&quot; and the hatred the Poles had for the Russians, knowing that they were covering up atrocities like the massacre of 18,000 Polish POWs in the Katryn forest by the KGB during WWII, and generally regarding Poland as an inferior puppet state. The focus of the story however, based in part on memories of stories told to the director during his youth, is the illicit love affair between the pregnant wife of a diffident long suffering Russian officer and a gallant handsome young Polish cadet. In a flash forward, after the fall of Communism, the now grey haired Russian returns with his grown up daughter some twenty years later to visit the grave of the mother she never knew. At the very end the aging Pole also makes a shadowy entrance and we suspect that he may actually have been her father.\n\nThis is a very carefully woven psychological study of four intertwined lives, and actor Leslaw Å»urek, now just thirty, who played the Polish officer is one of the leading stars of the new generation of Polish actors. Mr. Å»urek appeared in two other films shown here and was present at all screenings to field questions after each -- in fairly good if somewhat halting English! He is definitely an actor for Polish Film buffs to keep an eye on. Director Krzystek lives and works in WrocÅaw far from the major film scene in Warsaw. He makes few films but all are sharply observed and cleanly directed.. One of his best in the psychological study of a psychotic university professor entitled &quot;Polska Smierc&quot; or Death Polish Stye.",

Wong Bah Bo (played by Sammo Hung), Leung Yee Tai (played by Ching-Ying Lam) and Leung Jan (played by Yuen Biao) are all Wing Chun figures.  Wong Bah Bo and Leung Yee Tai were members of the Red Junk Opera Troupe who taught Leung Jan.  Leung Jan was Yip Man&apos;s sitaigung (sifu&apos;s sifu) as Yip Man studied under Chan Wah Sun (Leung Jan&apos;s student).  The most intriguing connection in all of this is that Bruce Lee was also a student of Yip Man (considered by many as the modern grandmaster of Wing Chun).  If you like this movie, you might want to check out &apos;Wing Chun&apos; starring Michelle Yeoh.  It&apos;s also a historical fictional account of Yim Wing Chun (after which the style was named).",

So, he was not a western specialist, he was not Lesley Selander or Ray Nazarro. But he was damn better than Sam Newfield. However concerning this plot, Newfield could have done the equivalent in terms of quality. It is a good little western though bringing nothing special, compared to others I have seen in my movie buff life. It deserves to be seen only for Corman, to help you to fill his filmography. Joan Taylor is the most interesting character of this movie."

This is not a masterpiece indeed; but it was able to get me a thrilling ride from beginning to end. To make it short, I would say this is a combination of &quot;BEHIND ENEMY LINES&quot; scenario at the pace and editing of &quot;BOURNE ULTIMATUM&quot; set at the backdrop of &quot;KING ARTHUR&quot;. It&apos;s true that script does not focus much on character development but it does not cause any trouble in enjoying this action-adventure. As one reviewer has mentioned, I agree that portrayal of a female warrior by Olga Kurylenko is much more realistic and successful than the similar role played by Keira knightly in &quot;King Arthur&quot;. It is really sad that movies like this are not given adequate publicity since this is much better than most big budget Hollywood movies that are being hyped inappropriately.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone loves an underdog story. They are done so much in film, and it&apos;s such a common notion that the line is even spoken in the new Dreamworks film &quot;Turbo&quot;. The best part in this instance though is, unlike other movies, it&apos;s genuine. You feel for this animated snail and his new friend a part owner of a taco shop. Both have dreams and do all they can to make them come true, even when their own family doesn&apos;t believe in them. The second best part is that it&apos;s fun for the entire family and could very well be the best animated film of the year.\n\nTheo is a snail who wants to be fast, much like Tom Hanks wanted to be Big and Rocky wanted to be champion. After a freak accident of Spider- Man proportions, he gets his chance to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Along the way he finds a friend and fellow dreamer he never actually speaks with in Tito (Michael PeÃ±a). Together they both reach for the impossible dreams that live in us all. The filmmakers of &quot;Turbo&quot; use both wish fulfillment and the belief on oneself to tell a familiar story with most of the troupes we&apos;ve seen before. What sells it here is voice actors ranging from the comedic Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, to the dramatic Paul Giamatti as his brother Chet. In between you have actors that have a foot in both dramatic works as well as comedy, like Luis GuzmÃ n, Maya Rudolph, Michelle Rodriguez, Richard Jenkins, and Samuel L. Jackson. It also tells its story with a singular goal in mind and still manages to have fun with sight gags, great one-liners, and involvement of the supporting cast.\n\nMy kids loved this film as did I, every year we get so many sequels there&apos;s quite a few this summer alone, and it&apos;s always refreshing to see a movie with the originality and the bravery to take a chance on a story that could have been a bad rip-off of Rocky, but instead reminded me of it in that good way. So go see &quot;Turbo&quot; this weekend, Adam Sandler and his pals have enough of our money, give it to real grown-ups who know how to make really enjoyable films like &quot;Turbo&quot;.\n\n--Robert L. Castillo\n\nhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

What I initially perceived to be a movie about a group of men working at a building site, was indeed a powerful story of unselfish love. The actors seemed raw and unpolished which gave it the feeling of reality in such a harsh corner of the world. The cinematography was incredible. A building site is an usual location for a love story. The actors and director did such a wonderful job, that I did not focus that much on their dismal surroundings. With the way love and sex is treated in many movies, it was wonderful to see how one could feel the love and devotion of one person of another without as much as a touch or kiss. I was also so touched by the lengths that the young man went through to help the girl he loved and her family. It did not even matter to him that she was unaware that he had given up everything he had for them. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "Apache renegade Ulzana goes on a murder raid, hot on his trail is a posse of cavalrymen. Led by the young and inexperienced Lt. Garnett DeBuin, the cavalrymen in order to survive and defeat Ulzana, must rely on the help of tough old scout McIntosh and his trusty Indian friend, Ke-Ni-Tay.\n\nDirected masterfully by Robert Aldrich (&quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; &amp; &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;), Ulzana&apos;s Raid is just shy of being an uncompromising masterpiece. There is no pandering to political correctness here, this is showing the bitter hostility of the Indian War, torture and murderous inclination is the order of the day. The allegories to Vietnam are hard to ignore as our band of men are struggling out in the wilderness against Ulzana&apos;s hostile raiders, the sprawling mountainous landscape another tool to the already handily equipped Apache.\n\nWhat lifts Ulzana&apos;s Raid high above many of its contemporaries is the on the money dialogue. A wonderfully complex script from Alan Sharp manages to make all the characters intriguing and deserving of further delving. The Apache are savage, and Aldrich doesn&apos;t flinch from showing this, but they are afforded respect, and crucially, understanding. This could quite easily have been a one sided blood letting exercise in Western folklore, but it isn&apos;t. The motives and attitudes of the white man party is there for all to scrutinise, with much attention to detail given as the many conversations bring rich and rewarding results to the discerning viewer. From the off it&apos;s evident that McIntosh &amp; DeBuin have vastly different views of Ulzana&apos;s actions, but as the film moves forward - all manner of questions leap out, be it Christian values, racial hatred or merely imperialistic trust, all parties involved are hurtling towards the final reckoning.\n\nBurt Lancaster is perfect as McIntosh, grizzled and carrying a frame made for such a rigorous terrain. Playing DeBuin is Bruce Davison, boyish charm fused expertly with unwanted bravado, while stealing the film is Jorge Luke as Ke-Ni-Tay. A performance of great depth that holds and binds the picture brilliantly. Sadly this film has been a victim of much interference over the years, (studio and Lancaster himself to blame), so much so there is thought to be about 6 cuts of the film out there in the home entertainment world. Thankfully we are now able to get a cut of the film that is almost complete, but still there remains to this day no definitive full cut of the film. German (the version I own) and Australian releases proclaim to have it uncut, but that&apos;s not accurate because there is still some three minutes missing from the very first cut of it - including a quite crucial sequence involving Sergeant and Trooper Miller (note at 49 minutes an intrusive quick cut from a night scene to a day scene) Still, it has to be said that even with 3 minutes chopped out of it, Ulzana&apos;s Raid is still a grim and brilliant piece of work. Showing the savagery from both sides of the fence, Aldrich and his team refuse to cop out and pander to formula. 9/10",

And yet here it is, how is possible to make such an awful picture. Ed Wood, please return, we forgive you. Please, do not ever watch this, don&apos;t waste your money, don&apos;t even download it. This film&apos;s like a bad version of Friday the 13th, but with lousy bears that actually do a better role than the actors. Glenn Morshower, he is the only good thing in this. And i&apos;m surprised why he accepted the role. Let&apos;s hope somebody erases this film from history. Still it got my comment to it :)",

This one is so awful, so contrived, so inane, so pretentious, so ludicrous at times ( particularly the dialogue ) that I wonder how well-known actors like Azema and Auteuil condescended to be part of such an abysmal opus. That it was well-received in France and Belgium is a sad reflection on some people&apos;s critical faculties, and also on the topics that we deem worthy of attention ( or rather on our treatment of them ). I understand that the directors, the Larrieu brothers, until their disastrous foray into serious film-making, had made documentaries about insects, quite a worthy enterprise ( one has only to think of the superb BBC productions ). Perhaps their intimacy with these tiny creatures have deprived them of any savoir-faire when dealing with human beings and their problems, since their stilted direction and clumsy camera work make the spectator wonder:&quot; am I missing something? Is there some hidden intention in such lack of talent ?&quot; I am relieved to note that there is a reviewer in Germany who shares my opinion that this film is unadulterated faeces.",

That was case with The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. My opinion of the film was not too positive going in. I was dragged to it by a friend of mine with questionable taste in movies to begin with. I could have not been more surprised. I found myself laughing through the entire feature.\n\nThe movie is pretty farcical to say the least, at some junctures borderline silly, but found myself quite enjoying the humor. It was a nice change of pace from all the recent comedies that have to go to the extreme with language and sex humor to make their point. It pokes fun at inter-workings of the illusionist and the final scene before the credits is classic.\n\nThe characters were very well cast. It is no secret based on past films and TV that Steve Carrell has experience in magic tricks, and he pulls it off in the film. It was also refreshing to see Steve Buscemi reprise a comedic role and carry, an impressive contrast to bootlegger Knucky Thompson. And as you would expect, Jim Carrey steals the show as the antagonistic shock magician, Steve Gray. For those who like these actors, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a silly, light hearted but enjoyable hour and forty minute movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Unbeatable, baleful, and sinister Ashura, Queen of the Demons, has a plan to dominate this world. \n\nThe Japanese film &quot;The Eyes of Ashura&apos;s Castle&quot; is set in the chaotic nineteenth century Edo (later Tokyo) where humans, demons, and evil spirits coexist. The Demon Wardens, a secret society, is beating invincible undead in the city. In the midst of the war between human beings and demons, Ashura&apos;s assistant Bizan notifies demon slayers about the rebirth of the impregnable queen Ashura in Edo. \n\nThe story revolves around the ghostly, heartrending love relationship between dandy Kabuki actor Wakuraba Izumo and a beautiful thief named Tsubaki. He is a former star demon slayer, and she is graceful and fierce. While developing their romance, they cross a border between this world and the next, which triggers a disastrous outcome. Ultimately, their love and fate unfold by insinuating a common memory of the past that is the dramatic relationship between killing and being killed. \n\nProfessional Kabuki actor Somegoro Ichikawa plays Wakuraba Izumo. He is the scion of the most famous Kabuki families whose tradition is much respected by many and recognized as one of the chief Japanese traditional art forms. His skillful and flamboyant swordplay is admirable. Rie Miyazawa, a popular Japanese actress, plays the mysteriously attractive yet ferocious Tsubaki. \n\nDirected by Academy Award winning film director Yojiro Takita, &quot;The Eyes of Ashura&apos;s Castle&quot; features a timeless range of cultural references to Japanese popular culture from romanticized eighteenth century Kabuki theater and its playwright Tsuruya Namboku IV&apos;s ghost stories to contemporary playful video games and computer graphics. Besides, the film skillfully adds exhilarating zombies with kimono costumes to Japanese pop music. A psychedelic mixture of old and new epitomizes the richness of Japanese popular culture. \n\nThe prologue is particularly an eerie collection of some Japanese myths and ethereal symbols. For instance, a fireball is approaching to Edo while Emish, an ominous demon, is singing a parody of children&apos;s tune, &quot;Toryanse.&quot; \n\nFurther, signposts for ogres such as bridges, borders, and twilight are effectively employed. A ghost emerges at the edge of a bridge connecting this world and the next. Additionally, seas, rivers, and mountains demarcate the two worlds. Finally, the opening scene is twilight, which is a brief period of ambiguous time. It is a time of transformation from one being to another. Indeed, the times of uncertainty are chances for ethereal beings that are roaming around the human world. \n\nFurthermore, a parody of legendary horror playwright Tsuruya Namboku IV (1755-1829) plays a crucial role to unite the whole eclectic Japanese national and cultural symbols: Kabuki theater, Izumo&apos;s crimson thread magic, Tokubei&apos;s giant frog, stylized actions, and the undying Japanese ghost story, &quot;Oiwa.&quot; Namboku produced many ghost stories for Kabuki plays, and also wrote about Tokubei&apos;s story. These cultural references from the early nineteenth century add an exotic character to the film.\n\nConsequently, the story unfurls a series of Namboku&apos;s fantastically weird tales, which include comedy, apparitions, love, tragedy, and disgust. A dreadful opening and a wonderful ending are key components of his story. Blurring this world and the next in the film, Namboku says &apos;which world you live in, the world has its own paradise.&apos; The poignant story, where the lovers cannot fulfill their love in this world, clearly follows Namboku&apos;s traditional Kabuki taste.\n\nOverall, the film is entertaining and worthwhile watching.",

And in the end, a lot of that humour was lost in the film. The film still had the amusing situation and black comedy of the book (even if the plot had been slightly rewritten) and some of the narrator&apos;s comments were included, but it was funny more in a sort of slapstick way, whereas the book is witty.",

Truly a work of art, and it&apos;s an injustice that it is not more well known for I stumbled across this movie by chance and had heard nothing of it. This is far better than anything at the theaters now a days and was so well done in every aspect of it. A must see movie for anyone who gets a chance, like an escape away from the usual routine we are accustomed to.\n\nFrom the beginning this movie will grab your attention. From the subtle effects that are done just right, to the acting from all parties of the cast. A very wholesome experience. Perhaps the rest of the film industry could take a lesson or two and make a decent movie like this and not waste millions of dollars on the junk they crank out on a daily basis."

      "description": "As the light fades and the city goes to sleep, two forces emerge. They are invisible except for the power they exert over us in our sleep, battling for our souls through dreams. One force delivers hope and strength through good dreams; the other infuses the subconscious with desperation through nightmares. John (Chris Kelly) and Emma (Quinn Hunchar), Father and Daughter are wrenched into this fantastical dream world battle, forced to fight for John&apos;s soul and to save Emma from an eternal nightmare. Separate in their journey, they encounter unusual characters that exist only in their subconscious. Or do they?",

      "reviewBody": "This film came to audiences at a rather schizophrenic time, things were changing, but not that much. Roles were assimilated, but not too drastically. People were questioning things, as long as it wasn&apos;t radical.\n\nWomen were still patronized, there were still clear role boundaries (witness the scene where Tom is knitting and catches derision for spending ten minutes in a sewing circle.) Not sure why that was a crime of the century, but whatever.\n\nDeborah Kerr is tender and memorable as an unhappy wife to the school master at a prep school who realizes her marriage is a sham. She realizes this when she sympathizes with a student and resident at her home, a confused young man who simply is shy and has doubts about his future. There are some nuances regarding sexuality, but in all honesty that was a side-story, from what I inferred.\n\nThe message I take away from this film is not simply about ostracism and hatred; Minnelli as director also addresses female emotion, the reasons why Kerr empathizes with the young man, and how he eventually moves on. In the long rung, it is life affirming, although rather opaque in its message.\n\nDiscrimination and hatred take many forms, and sometimes the subtler forms are most repellent. Highly recommended. 8/10.",

Tien Peng (aka Roc Tien from the trash-cult THE TONGFATHER) was a major star in Taiwan; his allied in this revenge story is Chiang Pin, a good performer in 76 movies. Both Peng and Pin were already paired in the Wuxia genre (RAIDERS OF REVENGE, 1972) and they worked better as swordsmen than as bare-handed fighters. Wong Chun Hsin (FIST OF FURY; THE WAY OF THE DRAGON) and his real-life wife Lina Chiao (THE ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN; RETURN OF THE ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN) plays respectively the evil Casino boss and the girl in distress in this mediocre movie. The fighitings are staged by Yao Tien Lung (who did better as leading actor in films like THE BAMBOO BROTHERHOOD) and another guy. Tech values, from the camerawork to the photography, manifestly shows a poor budget. The locations are the same you can see in many others Taiwan&apos;s Kung-Fu films of the period, expecially the river. Released 8/31/72 in Taipei. Actor-director Chin Sheng-En made about 30 movies, including THE DEVILISH KILLER, DUEL WITH SAMURAI and CHAOCHOW GUY, all of them on the same low-level, which can also be fun to watch sometime.",

This is the Â«Â storyÂ Â» of a man who tries to gather studies about plastic effects (on human health) for industries take the dangerous substances out of it. This movie is interesting; we realize that plastic is everywhere and unsafe for human health, but some thing are said several times and some scenes are not very attractive, for example the one with parts of human corpses conserved to do some art. Then, there are some boring parts, for instance when he (Werner Boote) walks and he&apos;s looking for the manager of plastic industry. Actually, this movie is interesting but a little bit boring. In my opinion, if you want to appreciate the film : watch it in several times when you&apos;re calm and when you want to learn about plastic. Finally, my opinion is mixed. As far I&apos;m concerned, I&apos;ve found it attractive despite the long and boring parts. My advice is to watch it and judge by yourself ... so, watch it and try to enjoy !",

The film succeeds in making gleeks feel like a community and is sprinkled with gleeks expressing their love for the series. Through, the actors act as their own characters. Making the story that the real Glee Club has gone on a national tour. You&apos;ll see them dancing as acting just as they do on the show and it will be like watching on long episode of the show. And it was refreshing to hear their voices without the autotune. The use of 3D added to the magic of the show. This is not a movie that should be avoided due to a pretentious prejudice against 3Dglee. For a Gleek, this movie will be one giant valentine.",

      "reviewBody": "This little video was entertaining, well-constructed and smoothly presented. It starts off slowly as a man-on-the-street type interview and gradually leads people through a series of their own conclusions to arrive at the ultimate realization of what abortion actually is, and what its availability means to our society as a whole. The interviewer interacts with all manner of individuals found strolling though what looks like Venice Beach or Santa Monica, in California. Some have extreme viewpoints, some are noncommittal. By the end of the movie all have made definite pronouncements about this issue. The film is eye-opening and fascinating in its approach. I showed it to my preteen children and they were quite engrossed the whole time. Two years later, they will still make an offhand comment or two about something they heard in this movie. This movie is genius because it makes no statements itself but helps you to make your own statements and draw your own conclusions. If anyone doesn&apos;t like the message presented in this movie, it&apos;s probably because they don&apos;t like the conclusions they themselves have come to while watching the interviews. I highly highly recommend this movie to anyone who has kids coming to terms with these social issues in our world.",

Poverty is never far away, and all the parties, nice costumes and laughters cannot really make you forget it. Alberto Sordi is splendid in the role of Totonno, sympathetic, cynical and unscrupulous drummer. Mario, interpreted by Renato Salvatori is the exact opposite: naive, sensitive and full of good intentions, he stands out by his freshness and his honesty in this world where everything is chattiness and where friendships are rather superficial. A magnificent impossible love story between Mario and big boss wife Paula Mayer, interpreted by the sublime Belinda Lee, brings a touch of tragic beauty to this deeply human story. This magnificent actress, too rare in cinema because she disappeared much too early at the age of 25, is alone worth watching the film. The close-ups of her face against the background of the port of Hamburg are deeply moving. Her beauty, made strength and fragility literally bursts the screen.",

The ubiquitous John Bentley as a river boat patrolman who holds the rank of detective inspector and who is investigating a case of diamond smuggling linked to a large ship docked on the Thames. He becomes involved with a young woman linked to the case and she reluctantly agrees to help him attempt to catch the criminal gang responsible.\n\nWhile the Thames setting is a quite unique one and makes RIVER BEAT stand out from all the rest of the British crime films of the era, the actual storytelling involved is unremarkable. The running time of RIVER BEAT is just 70 minutes but it feels at least twice that thanks to the sluggish pace and saggy middle where nothing really happens at all. The first part of the film and the climax are mildly exciting but there&apos;s a whole lot of time wasting in between.\n\nBentley is a reliable hero and American import Phyllis Kirk (HOUSE OF WAX) is fine in support. As usual there are plenty of faces lower down in the cast list including Glyn Houston (brother of Donald), Bill Nagy, Michael Balfour, Robert Ayres, and Charles Lloyd Pack. I was surprised that Sam Kydd didn&apos;t show up at some point as this would have been a good fit for him.",

She invents a scenario for how a burglar might have murdered her. What she didn&apos;t expect was for the police to find a suspect...\n\nEverything just goes completely right in Cookie. The atmosphere really gels, the cast are cohesive, the plot situation is interesting and its subtextual implications on suicide is also fascinating. Its actually an Altman film you feel like delving into. The amateur production of Salome the community are putting on is one of his most interesting devices. It gets you thinking of rhythms that run through the film, of suicide and human existence.\n\nAlso, Glenn Close&apos;s being a theatrical director, and carrying those skills into everyday life, to fairly extreme measures in the film, is an interesting subtext - commenting on the director/author as God.\n\nAltman&apos;s regular themes of the small town and the weather are here - the weather once again reminding us of a higher force we have no control over.\n\nI thought it was a fascinating, enjoyable film. I laughed out loud many times - mainly at just fun little aspects of the characters. Which is why it was such a pleasant surprise that Cookie&apos;s Fortune was not only an enjoyable movie, its actually a really great one.\n\n10/10. One of Altman&apos;s best, and my favourites so far.",

The baron recites Goethe&apos;s poem, &quot;ErlKonig&quot; and interprets it for the young boy-man. Schubert set this poem to music (ErlKonig, The Erl King). The poem is a dialog of a child, and his father who holds him close as they ride horseback toward their home. The child expresses fear and apprehension about what he sees on the journey. At the end of the poem, the &quot;kind war tot&quot; - &quot;the child was dead&quot; in the arms of his father. This movie is about the &quot;death&quot; of childhood, which must take place if a boy is to become a man. The film is filled with obvious symbolism and has a most satisfying conclusion. This is a personal favorite. If you can find a copy, buy it.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie today for the first time, it&apos;s a typical Heinz RÃ¼hmann vehicle, set during the Wirtschaftswunder era in Germany. RÃ¼hmann plays Max who makes a living picking pockets and keeping an honorable surface towards his kids (of course, he&apos;s the loving dad) and the neighbors. He keeps out of big time crime, but has an in-law who is a no-good - and who inevitably falls into the lures of the crimelord, who is of course named Joe (Haha!). Sticking to his principles of not telling the police anything, he manages to make up with the big shots and turn good for a happy ending.\n\nThe movie was actually a little dated, especially with the dialogue (the ever-prominent youth slang issue when watching 35-year-old flicks), but on the other hand it surprised me with some swearing, cool music (The Shadows perhaps?), and even a short scene of female nudity from behind.\n\nIt was definitely a better RÃ¼hmann film and worth watching. As always, he plays the perfect, caring daddy; watch out for an out-of-character appearance by a very young Hans Clarin.\n\n7.5 / 10"

      "reviewBody": "i have anticipated the viewing of this film for quite some time. its legend, being as infamous as it is, required me to see it, no matter how awful. i was also eager to see it based not only on my love for The Deer Hunter, which is tremendous, but also on my even greater love for the western genre in general. when i saw that IFC was playing the film this afternoon, i almost soiled myself with glee. however, i must admit that my eagerness was coupled with the bias of reviewers labeling the work as self-indulgent. i had no idea. the film is remarkably similar to the work of Terrence Malick on Days of Heaven. both films are image-heavy, but light on dialogue and plot. however, Days of Heaven succeeds in transporting the viewer to a world of transcendence and naturalistic beauty where HG succeeds only in forcing the viewer to act as surrogate editor since none of the five persons credited with the responsibility were able to do their job correctly. this is not to say that the film is bad. not in the least. it is, however, quite necessary for enjoyment that the viewer either be a student of film and its history, or at least have a lot time on your hands with no real concern about whether a story is being told, or simply hinted at. it would also help for the viewer to carry with her/him a sense of idealistic nostalgia bordering on naivetÃ©, since the film seems to be resplendent with said qualities. i happen to possess all of the above and was therefore able to thoroughly enjoy myself for the entire 3hrs and 45min. of the film. i find myself wanting to watch it again. i think some of the muddled characters bare repeat viewing for complete understanding, while others are archetypal and without dimension. Sam Waterston&apos;s character does everything short of twirling a handlebar mustache in order to leave us without doubt of his villainy. in contrast, Walken, Kristofferson, and Hurt all have multi-faceted characters not easily recognizable in the realm of Hollywood caricatures. David Mansfield&apos;s score is exquisitely complimentary of the majestic cinematography helm-ed by Vilmos Zsigmond. the battle scene, while confusing, is more true-to-life than most of the overly choreographed &quot;epics&quot; of that period or any other. i submit that this film is essential viewing for aspiring film makers. its viewing, if not ownership, is also necessary for the exhaustive collection of all true cinemaphiles. did i mention it&apos;s a little long?",

      "reviewBody": "The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by FranÃ§ois Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine&apos;s life.\n\nAs Antoine, Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine&apos;s character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.\n\nThe story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it."

      "reviewBody": "Ria (Olivia Williams) lives in Dublin with her husband and two children, a newly teen girl and son a couple of years younger. Their residence is called Tara Road. Alas, bad, hurtful news arrives soon enough. After a birthday party for her younger child, hubby announces that he has a galfriend on the side and she&apos;s pregnant. Devastated, Ria doesn&apos;t know which way to turn. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Marilyn (Andie McDowell) is equally in despair. Her only child, a teen son, had a motorcycle accident and passed away, also at a birthday party. Not even her caring husband can raise her spirits. She sends him off to a vacation in Hawaii alone, for she has other plans. A while ago, Marilyn heard of a house swap in Dublin and calls the number. It&apos;s Ria, who answers in the middle of the night. Nevertheless, this exchange sounds just like what she needs, too. So, off Ria goes to Connecticut while Marilyn boards a plane to Ireland. Slowly, the plan works. Marilyn meets a gardener/chef Colin (Stephen Rea) whose gentle attention and good humor helps this Yankee immensely. Then, Ria is beset with Marilyn&apos;s good buddies who plan outings and conversations. But, is there still some secrets to uncover? If it is so, will Ria and Marilyn learn to unlock their hearts again? This lovely movie has too little of Ireland but otherwise is great! Actually, the scenes in Dublin are wonderful and so are the venues in the States. In addition, the acting is touching, with Williams and McDowell giving carefully nuances performances and the supporting cast, even the so-called villains, doing fine work, too. Costumes, script and steady direction help move the film admirably to the end. Are you a person grieving the loss of someone important or do you just like romantic, thoughtful dramas? Then, tarry someday with Tara Road very soon.",

      "name": "The first Golden Age of Disaster Movies closes with this whimper as `time runs out&apos;-- on the genre.",
      "reviewBody": "\n* 2/5 STARS -\n\n\n The operator of a tropical hotel conceals the mounting threat of the island&apos;s active volcano when his laissez-faire partner and a renegade oilman start asking questions.  When the volcano finally blows its top, a small group of hotel residents make a dangerous trek to higher ground, but not all will survive as the peak spews smoke, fire, and lava across the island.\n\nThis relaxed disaster movie signals the end of the first Golden Age of Disaster movies.  It is appropriate, then, that it was produced by Irwin Allen and recycles a variety of cliches that spanned the seventies.  When Paul Newman and Jacqueline Bisset start sipping wine on the beach with the volcano in the distance, for example, we know to start counting the minutes until the mountain blows.\n\nWith both Paul Newman and William Holden playing roles very similar to those in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, it isn&apos;t difficult to draw parallels between the two movies.  &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, however, was a unique project involving a joint venture between two studios, a huge budget, an all-star cast, and a blockbuster script culled from the best elements of two popular novels. Does When Time Ran Out represent what we should expect from Irwin Allen when all of the cards AREN&apos;T stacked in his favor?\n\nWhen Time Ran Out harkens back to the drama-heavy days of the original Airport, with a web of infidelity that will make your head spin.  Battle lines are quickly drawn between the defensive developer of the island (Franciscus) and a renegade oil driller (Newman) who believes the mountain is, as he puts it, `a powder keg.&apos;\n\nOccasional visits to the volcano&apos;s crater provide distraction while the relationships between the characters are cultivated for the disaster. The oilman stirs up trouble when he wants to see for himself that the mountain is safe before drilling in a high-pressure oilfield.  However, it&apos;s just ridiculous to think that his inspection would involve stepping into a laughable protective capsule and being lowered inside the smoldering volcano.  Naturally, the capsule--with a glass floor!--experiences a series of unexplained malfunctions that send him hurtling towards bubbling lava at the bottom of the crater.\n\nIt&apos;s the kind of special effect that Irwin Allen was famous for from his television days on The Time Tunnel and elsewhere.  But the silver screen requires a much greater level of believability than is needed by television. When Time Ran Out contains some of the worst effects in the history of the genre--images which aren&apos;t even acceptable for the SMALL screen.  What happened to the Master of Disaster?\n\nWhen Time Ran Out is heavy on talk before the volcano erupts, but the runaway action we were expecting during the buildup simply never arrives. Only two action sequences occur with the Newman followers, and they both involve a large group of people taking a very long time to cross a treacherous path to safety.  It&apos;s a snooze-fest all around.\n\n The special effects are ho-hum, even though Irwin Allen attempts to diversify the experience with flaming meteors fired from the volcano and a tidal wave that inexplicably levels part of the same island whose shock wave created it!  They&apos;re not enough.  Most of the visuals are clearly pre-existing volcano footage placed on a chroma-key in front of the actors. And the rest of the eruption footage appears to be poorly executed post-production animation.\n\nThe lush tropical setting is a refreshing change of pace for most disaster movies, and Jacqueline Bisset and Paul Newman try their best to keep things classy.  But an unnecessary cock fight in the village and a preposterous laboratory perched on the rim of the volcano immediately suggest that this movie needs a dose of reality--and adrenalin.  The first Golden Age of Disaster Movies closes with this whimper as `time runs out&apos;-- on the genre."

Sounds interesting, huh, wrong, the stars play second banana to a monster clearly made for less than the budget of your average candy bar. What&apos;s worse is that the film is so dark, half of the time you can&apos;t see what little action there is. For unintentional yuks this is one of those movies that can&apos;t be beat, but if your in the mood for a surreal horror thriller look elsewhere."

The renowned writer of Juno is making a entirely different attempt here by depicting a mid-life crisis of Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) and her return visit to her hometown where she lived when she was a teenager.\n\nMavis hated the town, hated everything about it, hated all the people in it, that was, except Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), who used to be her boyfriend. It didn&apos;t take her long to decide that she would return and rescue Buddy who she thought was a hostage in the deadly town with his marriage and newborn daughter. She would save herself from the disappointment from her life, save Buddy from the living hell, and picked up where things ended, once and for all.\n\nAnd well, you expected it. Things were not as simple as that; they never are. So get ready for the adventure in this visit and get ready to know our Mavis better.\n\nCharlize Theron totally manipulated the role of Mavis, letting the audience get to know who Mavis Gary really was as the events continued to unfold. It was a solid, realistic and Oscar-worthy performance that blew the audience away.\n\nYoung Adult is about life, about the past and the present, about why people are easily stuck in the past and do not see a future ahead of them. This is about why we should accept the present and look forward instead of always looking back. It is also more of a drama than a comedy but still it did give me some laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw this movie on cable (not, I assure you, by design). The plot is pretty much as described here in the IMDb. &quot;Hysterical&quot; IS pretty hysterically awful, but it does not quite fit in the category of Movies So Bad They&apos;re Good. Yes, the plot is clichÃ©d and predictable. Yes, it stars the Hudson Brothers, those inoffensive pop products from the Seventies who were quickly forgotten in the Eighties. I, for one, certainly hadn&apos;t thought about them since then and had no idea they&apos;d made a movie. It also features a gaggle of supporting actors whose faces will be recognizable to anyone who watched movies and TV in the Sixties and Seventies or who watches TVLand today. The female lead is Cindy Pickett, who looks and acts so wholesome here that it&apos;s hard to believe she appeared in an earlier film, Roger Vadim&apos;s &quot;Night Games,&quot; that was very erotic. She radiates essentially no sexual luster in &quot;Hysterical.&quot; Still, the production values are surprisingly good for a bad movie. It looks and feels like a real movie; this is not Edward D. Wood stuff. The Hudson Brothers actually manage to work up a respectable comic energy. There are a few breakout scenes that are extremely funny, especially the big production number with dancing zombies in an amusement park, and a too-brief scene in which the brothers try to confuse some pursuing zombies with an impromptu doo-wop session. The movie also works in sendups of a lot of other films (&quot;Vertigo,&quot; &quot;Marnie,&quot; &quot;The Rocky Horror Show,&quot; &quot;Chariots of Fire,&quot; and &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; to name just a few). All in all, this is a movie that is fun to see once just for laughs.",

Why do we have to put up with steaming crap like this, let alone praise it? It&apos;s NOT realistic, it&apos;s merely a Swedish remake of the equally pseudo-shocking &quot;Thirteen&quot;, only with a dumber sense of humour and minus the hotness of Evan Rachel Wood. The plot is dull, the jokes are mind-numbing (not to mention incredibly awkward and out of place in a movie which supposedly portrays teenage life as it really is), the performances sub-par. I don&apos;t know what else to say except don&apos;t see this and watch Torkel i Knipa instead. It&apos;s a movie about teenage life which is easier to relate to, much funnier, and oh, it doesn&apos;t suck. Unsurprisingly that film came from Denmark, a country which is so much better at movie-making than Sweden, it&apos;s embarrassing.",

But to me the movie is more entertaining than many actionmovies. It&apos;s definitely not for all viewers hence the bad overall ratings, but I can still recommend it. The acting is over the top. Hoffman and Franz is a very funny combination. Seldom have I seen someone make so much out of so little. As oppose to other movies the climax isn&apos;t in the ending, every scene is equally important. Not as good as Glengarry glen ross though. GGR was both a character study and a good movie. This is &quot;just&quot; an excellent character study, but with these actors it&apos;s enough to make it worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "Hickey &amp; Boggs is directed by Robert Culp and written by Walter Hill. It stars Culp, Bill Cosby, James Woods, Ta-Ronce, Carmencristina Moreno, Rosalind Cash, Lou Frizzel, Isabel Sanford and Sheila Sullivan. Music is by Ted Ashford and cinematography by Bill Butler. \n\nAl Hickey (Cosby) &amp; Frank Boggs (Culp) are two jaded private investigators who get hired to find a missing woman and quickly find themselves submerged in a world of murder and untruths. \n\nI don&apos;t think the title does it any favours, because in no way does it imply what a bleak and potent neo-noir this is. In many ways Hickey &amp; Boggs is the anti private investigator film, it portrays two men failing in life who are just about clinging to the last vestiges of their work, that of the private dick. Robert Culp and Walter Hill strip everything back to unglamourous terms, there is nothing remotely sexy or invigorating about this detective agency, Al and Frank do it because it&apos;s all they have, all they know in fact. \n\nThe film makers push the two men through a grimy and fetid Los Angeles, pitching them in amongst an array of weirdos, killers, revolutionaries, sexual deviants and angry officials. There&apos;s actually a lot of bold colours on show, the two PI&apos;s themselves wearing bright lurid blue and green suits, but all the colour coding on show in the film is a front, a misdirection tactic, this Los Angeles is on the surface colourful and sunny into the bargain, but Hickey &amp; Boggs firmly operates on a seedy and downbeat level, the urban milieu as far removed from a holiday brochure as you can get. \n\nAl and Frank, bless their shabby souls, are damaged goods, incapable of the kind of human interaction that most take for granted. Even between themselves they have lost the will to interact outside of work orientated chatter. In fact chatter is a key issue in the film, or lack of as it turns out. There&apos;s some beautifully zippy dialogue throughout, real spiky barbs straight out of noirville, but the pic is at its best, away from the action scenes, in how periods of silence involving Al &amp; Frank say so much. One will either rant or repeatedly ask a question, while the other stares off into space or nurse yet another alcoholic beverage to forget his pain. As a character study, this wades through the sludge and blood to show a clinically cynical hand. \n\nThen there is the action scenes, excellently constructed by Culp. Two shoot-outs especially are high grade in quality, and extended they are as well. Aurally they are like a Panzer Division unloading its armoury, visually it&apos;s intentionally comic book as per bullets used, but excitement is guaranteed, while the finale, is played out on a beach that gives great carnage and then cuts like a knife to close the pic down in the most suitable of fashions. The screenplay is at times a little too aware of trying to be a convoluted nudge nudge wink wink to the halcyon days of film noir, with Walter Hill on his first writing assignment proving to be wet behind the ears, though the eagerness and respect of the style of film making is genuine in the extreme. \n\nThree absolutes come out of viewing Hickey &amp; Boggs nowadays. One, is that Culp the director, some minor pacing issues aside, really shouldn&apos;t have let the film&apos;s poor box office prevent him from directing further assignments. Two, is that Cosby shows here he was capable of great character based drama, his performance is simply terrific. Three? Hickey &amp; Boggs is under seen, under valued and should be a requisite viewing for anyone interested in neo-noir. 9/10",

It&apos;s not an intimate portrait of people -as the Swedish director always does. Here we have a big budget movie, with many actors... Although the presence of Liv Ullmann, Bergman loses his targets. On one side he wants to analyze a period, on the other one he has to follow more mainstream rules -because he works for a big budget production. As a result he &quot;fails&quot; (it&apos;s a big word) in both things -although the film is not a failure.\n\nWe feel Ingmar Bergman is not really at ease. This is not his natural dimension -he&apos;s a super director because he has an extraordinary ability of understanding neurosis and anxieties, his favorite context are the relationships among a few people. In &quot;The Serpent&apos;s Egg&quot; these trademark are really minor.",

It covers the deserts of southern Africa from the Namib Desert to the Kalahari Desert with a little bit of humor. It has some memorable nature scenes. In fact, this is the first theatrical film of my memories. I still remember many scenes like the droplet which sets a bird&apos;s nest on fire and the fish which protects her young by keeping them in her mouth. It is strange and wonderous and unforgettable. The cinematography is fair with some great animal footage. The humor in the narration is mostly gentle but also differentiates it from the other nature films. This certainly gives those others a run for their money.",

The plot is a bit confusing, there are some huge plot holes and the wore work is more than a tad silly at times.\n\nThis is the first time is Seagal looks bloated, and his close ups are mostly framed to cut out his chin and hairline\n\nBut he still looks like he can kick ass. His wardrobe is on the ridiculous side again but he does seem like he still cares (I think it was Evan who said it previously) even if he uses stunt doubles and is dubbed at times.\n\nI didn&apos;t like how the right scenes were shot (especially nor the one in the market) clearly not Seagal doing most of it.\n\nI really like the Buddhist monk who was Seagal&apos;s friend. He was awesome, a great sidekick for Seagal. I didn&apos;t like the ending for his character at all.\n\nDirector Siu-Tung Ching filmed most of the action scenes without the involvement of Seagal, opting to film his shots last, but conflict arose when Seagal insisted on filming his shots in a way that wouldn&apos;t accommodate the existing footage. Ching is said to have left the set, taking his stunt crew with him and welcoming Seagal to finish the scene by himself. This infuriated the producers, who convinced Seagal to go along with Ching&apos;s approach.\n\nAll in all, ridiculous and totally implausible, but a watchable dtv flick.",

The footage has been shown on news stations, but this is a collection of the footage showing a complete story.\n\nThe reporters faced death or life imprisonment to get this footage. Once the military realized that the footage was being sent by the reporters, and not foreign journalists, they systematically hunted them down.\n\nThose who were not arrested, spread out through the country.\n\nIt was a touching story of how the people stood up to oppression. They were not teabaggers, but people willing to die for freedom.",

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s the way I would describe this film...It is true that not many(none?)action films are done in Mexico but it isn&apos;t just about trying, if that were the case then everybody could do film-making. From the producers of Matando Cabos comes this (well intended?)action film that pretends to be original but in it&apos;s effort it results more generic than everything, first of all Tony Dalton&apos;s screenplay is way to thin to even sustain a film of 90 minutes, you can tell he wanted to have lots of surprise moments in his film but instead of feeling like smart twists the plot feels full of inconsistencies and as if the screenwriter thought &quot;well what then&quot; and suddenly a twist for the plot came to his mind. The use of music while adequate at some moments becomes excessive and the film relies way too much on it to create an atmosphere and I say create not enhance. One thing you can&apos;t say, and it is that the director didn&apos;t put style in the film, he uses every angle &amp; shot he knows in the film whether it is to compensate for the lack of substance or just to show his &quot;film skills&quot; I don&apos;t know but I think is the latter.Now about the acting the only rescuable performance is Jordi MollÃ¡&apos;s in his brief role, Dalton and De LaReguera are adequate but then again the screenplay doesn&apos;t help that much and Silverio Palacios as in Matando Cabos plays the cool guy.The action sequences don&apos;t stand for something new or groundbreaking and some are excessively long and some could&apos;ve been just avoided but then again the had to fill time since the screenplay couldn&apos;t. A movie to watch just if there&apos;s nothing better to do, and if you wan&apos;t to check out Tony Dalton&apos;s work you better watch Matando Cabos which even when it thinks of itself as original but owes lots of films, still is way more fun and entertaining than Sultanes del Sur.",

The opening scene, crammed with name actors is terrific. A family consisting of Fran Drescher, Chris Kattan, and James Cahn, among others, has just finished their Christmas dinner, thanking the &quot;Almighty&quot; for not making them poor, when literally, Bill Goldberg busts from the fireplace as &quot;Santa&quot;, and outrageous mayhem ensues. Thus the tone is set for this over the top &quot;black comedy&quot;. Robert Culp plays an eccentric Grandfather, who does curling battle with &quot;Santa&quot;, in an effort to end the reign of &quot;yule tide fear&quot;. The movie does slowly slide downhill, and one of the leads, Douglas Smith, is marginal at best, but &quot;Santa&apos;s Slay&quot; is still highly recommended for those who like their Christmas comedy on the dark side. - MERK",

New Mexico, the Southwest; a visual palette reminiscent of the artist Georgia O&apos;Keefe. Beautiful photography, and a dysfunctional family trying to survive- two young girls living with their disillusioned mother.\n\nThis film addresses a niche which is not mainstream, but real...disappointed Americans living and working , trying their best, yet opposed by the realities. This film deserves 10/10- a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "Ghost Dog is an excellent ode to Hip-Hop and samurai movies, molded into a framework of European film making. It is a meditation on philosophy, literature, the banality of violence, and on miscommunication. As such, this is a great movie with a strong independent feel to it. The story is very simple. A man (Forest Whitaker) who was once saved by a mobster, lives a life dedicated to perfection of the martial arts guided by the Hagakure, the code of the samurai (Hagakure roughly means &quot;Hidden Leaves&quot; or &quot;Hidden By Leaves&quot; and was written by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, a samurai who was denied seppuku and lived out his life as a buddhist monk, which is when he wrote his book). Whitaker is a hitman with only one employer (the geriatric mobster who saved him) and can only be contacted by carrier pigeon. When a hit turns bad, he is forced to fight off the mobster and his fellow geriatric &quot;made men&quot; (who are less Al Pacino in The Godfather, than Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco). They personify the same dying way of life that Tsunetomo represented when he wrote his book, which is as much an obituary to a dying ethic, as the samurai class needed to adapt itself even during the Tokugawa shogunate (let alone after the Meiji Restoration in the 19th century).\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a fast action movie with lots of hyperrealistic blood and guts, you will be disappointed. \n\nHowever, if you are interested in the interaction of movies and literature, violence and miscommunication, honor and philosophy, and culture clashes (not in the least the director&apos;s slow moving European style superimposed on one of the world&apos;s fastest cities, New York), this is a wonderfully set out masterpiece. At turns hilarious, camp, profound, I found the action actually pretty good. In this movie, it isn&apos;t about luck or superfast guns, but it is the person who is most prepared to kill who wins.\n\nForest Whitaker, Camille Winbush, John Tormey and the rest of the cast give performances that range from very nice to great."

While I haven&apos;t watched the first movie yet (haven&apos;t had the chance), I obviously don&apos;t share those reviewers&apos; perspective.\n\nIn fact, I kind of liked this movie. Sure, it&apos;s obviously a low-budget movie, the visual effects are decent, at best, but it has a nice story, good acting (for the most part, at least), and a really nice soundtrack, in my opinion, which I consider an important part of any movie or TV show.\n\nWhile this movie is not for everyone, I would recommend it to any real fans of the fantasy genre. I know I am one, and I definitely enjoyed the movie.\n\nBy the way, when you watch the movie, make sure you wait until after the ending credits for another short yet funny scene. :)",

      "reviewBody": "The movie&apos;s funniest scene is a compilation of scenes from German sex-ed movies that were popular in the sixties and seventies. And that tells a lot about this movie.\n\nIt is so sad that the movie is so very shallow, because by looking at the picture it is obvious that there were many talented and ambitious people involved.\n\nThat it not to say that the movie is bad. In fact, you will probably have a good time at the cinema and leave it very amused. There are some fresh jokes, very good actors and an incredible production design that gets the sixties right by not making it too glamorous, although it sometimes looks a little too polished.\n\nUnfortunately, the plot does not have anything to do with the Munich sex film industry at all, as the tag-line and the production material would like you to think. And this is where the movie gets disappointing. Instead of really dealing with this industry which would probably make for a very funny movie in itself, the film follows a bunch of losers who would like to make a movie LIKE the Munich sex film industry. Neue Constantin Film has done a lot of these movies as well in that time so there should be a lot of material in the archives that could have been used for reference, but instead, after the compilation scene mentioned earlier, the movie does not have anything to do with that business at all.\n\nThere was just so much potential here and instead of using it the producers went for the easiest route which makes this film ultimately shallow and irrelevant.\n\nI want to point out two things that I found especially distracting and disappointing.\n\na) Mousse T. has been hyped as having delivered his first movie soundtrack here. His music is actually quite good, a very enjoyable soundtrack. BUT it is completely wrong for this movie. While the beats seem to be reminiscent of the sixties, it is not at all reminiscent of any German music of the time. Sure, people listened to soul and music like that but for a movie like this it would have been more appropriate to remix some of the typical music found in German movies of the time. I guess that choice would have seemed too risky for the producers.\n\nThe soundtrack choice is a typical example of this movie that makes fun of the sixties from our point of view with an attitude that seems to say: &quot;Aren&apos;t we so much more advanced today?&quot; There is also a scene in which a naked woman walks across the room with a ridiculous amount of pubic hair. Instead of letting the comedy come out of the fact that the scene is witnessed by a young guy who has never experienced sexual freedom the movie chooses to make fun of the fact that women did not shave their pubic hair at the time. A movie like &quot;Sonnenallee&quot; made fun of life in the German Democratic Republic of the seventies by showing its oddities, but it never showed modern audiences as more advanced or superior. this movie chooses this point of view which somehow leaves a bad aftertaste.\n\nb) This is a typical movie where in the end the plot is completely pushed aside to make way for the relationship of the protagonists. I don&apos;t spoil too much by saying that this movie has the typical ending where one character has to declare his love to the other in front of a large group. And as if this isn&apos;t enough, he has to do it TWICE in front of two different groups until the other person finally gives in. If you had your eyes rolling at the clichÃ© the first time around you will stark shaking your head at the second time.\n\nBut I am making the movie sound worse than it actually is. In fact, apart from the ending nothing about this movie is really bad, it is just never as good as it could have been. It is fun while it lasts if you don&apos;t think too much about it. I was especially surprised by Benno FÃ¼rmann who often seems to act a little wooden but comes across well here as good-for-nothing Freddie. But I bet that you will forget the movie shortly after you walk out of the cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Anoop Menon has disappointed me lately with an array of below-the-belt movies, although he has done his part very well.\n\n916 starts off with a cool ambiance and a linear screenplay till it hits interval. The direction is average and the cast performance is good. But as the movie progresses, it loses luster and the on-screen drama gets more melodramatic and monotonous than funny &amp; receptive. Entertaining is the least the second half does and totally deviates from the main topic. With a couple of sub-narrative shorts, the story- line is predictable. With a running time of around 2 hours, 916 bores you towards the end.\n\nWith a hell of a lot of revealing mistakes and plot holes and unanswered questions, this comedy-drama fairs just below average with no respect to phenomenal artists like Mukesh &amp; Anoop Menon. Asif Ali is totally wasted, but he does his job fairly enough.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: 916 is predictable, boring &amp; rusty which deals with a good social awareness message in the first half but fades to black in the second.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: No | Sex, Nudity or Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence: No | Vulgarity: No | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mild | Drugs: No",

When she involves with Rahul she was just a young girl. But when she got to know that she was pregnant and the society, her parents &amp; all of the above Rahul is not going to accept that child she takes the decision to earn for herself and for her baby. This was the turning point of her life. This is the real courage I am impressed with. No one of us has this kind of courage to accept our own mistakes like this, that it doesn&apos;t look like a mistake, but sets a great example for the society. Because all of the above society, Parents and all the human creatures there is god who is in your heart. You do right or wrong just be true to yourself and he(God) will accept you in every manner.",

The script is very simple, very similar to Under Siege2. Only they made it too stupid: the writers have a strange opportunity about the audience: they put the intellectual level very low. They think that people that watch action movies are all mentally retarded. I think not. Well, the summary is that this is a really funny film, altought it shouldn&apos;t be one.

      "reviewBody": "Director Robert Wiene and star Conrad Veidt reteam for this Austrian horror suspense drama. Veidt plays Paul Orlac, a famous concert pianist who gets severely injured in a train crash. Dr. Serral (Hans Homma) tries an experimental technique wherein he grafts the hands of a dead man onto Orlac&apos;s arms, and the surgery is a success, but afterward, when Orlac learns that the hands belonged to an executed murderer, he starts to lose his mind, believing that the hands are commanding him to kill again. Also featuring Alexandra Sorina, Fritz Strassny, Paul Askonas, Carmen Cartellieri, and Fritz Kortner.\n\nWiene continues to use Expressionistic techniques and visual schemes, but they are toned down, and used to accentuate the narrative rather than overwhelming the proceedings. The film marks an important step in the transition from purely arthouse Expressionism to the techniques used in the visual language of film noir. Veidt gives an intense, tortured performance, although Kortner pales in comparison to the later remake Mad Love and Peter Lorre&apos;s take on the character. Most sources list this as being roughly 90 minutes, but the version I watched was 113 minutes. I felt that could have been trimmed down a bit, as some scenes dragged. That being said, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and the cinematography was beautiful.",

Fortunately, we caught it in the form of a borrowed DVD, never having the stomach to spend full price on this formula comedy.\n\nDirector Gary David Goldberg&apos;s take on this situation doesn&apos;t bring anything new. The film is harmless enough not to offend anyone, but in retrospect, one has to wonder why was the film made in the first place? Poor Diane Lane, she keeps showing up in these inane comedies that don&apos;t do anything for her. She is a beautiful woman who could do better, but whoever is advising her keeps steering her in the wrong direction, unfortunately. Ditto for John Cusack. One wonders what attracted actors of the stature of Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing to appear in a movie that will certainly not add anything in their C.V.s.\n\nThe cute Newfoundland puppies that were used in the movie should have been given more opportunities to show their talents.",

The general in charge of the academy is one of the frontexperienced officers, who is using reason and is focused on the task. Not paying too much attention on backdoor politics until a young Lieutenantlooses his live in a blasting &quot;accident&quot;. The General does not believe in an accident and entrust&apos;s another frontexperienced officer with the investigation of the incident. The truth will be a dangerous truth, and the abyss for honest officers. There is an amazingly wide range of characters pitted against each other, that you will find in simular institutions today. A lot of backstabbing, betrayal and the absence of compassion. Painful in it&apos;s conclusion and truthfulness, this movie will probably have a difficult time to reach a larger audience. The universal message of yesterday still holds truth today. Indeed a very underrated movie, and a rare gem.",

      "name": "Slow-moving , boring Rat Pack vehicle in which bandits and bad bankers battle for a stash of gold",
      "reviewBody": "This sometimes lively comedy western , though frankly tiring , contains a great but wasted cast . It starts with the opening credits: The characters and events depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or events is purely coincidental . Â¨4 for TexasÂ¨ is set in the old west where outlaws and powerful people fight for a stash of gold . It packs a motley group of roles : A swindler insurance agent (Frank Sinatra) , an adventurer (Dean Martin) who winds up with a bag of someones else&apos;s cash , a banker (Victor Buono) is up to no good in Galveston and he hires a hired gun (Charles Bronson making the most impression) . As starring duo : Sinatra , Martin , play a couple of lovable rogues who make a last-ditch alliance to defeat even bigger crooks themselves . As Sinatra attempts to get the better of both of them . Later on ,there appears two beautiful girls (Anita Ekberg , Ãrsula Andress , though one of the roles was originally intented for Gina Lollobrigida) to conquer them . The far out story of the far west. How the West Was Lost! They&apos;re Busting Up The West Like It&apos;s Never Been Busted Up Before! It&apos;s a daisy!\n\nA lousy blend of comedy , Western , thrills , excessive dialogue with no sense and far too dependant on the femine charisma of two Euro-stars . All this unfolds with a runaway cruise control male that leads to mayhem and confusion . Embarring , absurding , ridiculous screenplay full of silliness and non-sense from Teddi Sherman and Robert Aldrich himself . The whole affair is slowly coloured chuckle from beginning to end with a briefly satisfactory , if somewhat obvious climax . The opening scenes are magnificent , as a stagecoach manned by Sinatra beats off attackers before crashing breathtakingly on the dust . Unfortunately , only the final at the Â¨La Maison RougeÂ¨ , an overloaded Mississippi riverboat side-wheeler , comes up to this standard comic western movie . Co-stars two gorgeous ladies , Anita Ekberg , Ãrsula Andress , more exposed by their silly dialogue than their low-cut costumes . Both of them give statuesque immovility to their interpretations . Here only stands out Charles Bronson at the liveliest presence in the movie. There are some bright guest appearances , especially that by Victor Buono , Nick Dennis , Richard Jaeckel , Mike Mazurki , Virginia Christine , Ellen Corby , Abraham Sofaer , final film of Jack Lambert, and Jack Elam .\n\nSharply filmed in Technicolor by prestigious cameramen as Ernest Laszlo , Joseph Biroc , Brunet Guffey , Alan Rudolph . Catching and lively musical score by Nelson Riddle . The picture was lousily directed by Aldrich . Perhap&apos;s Aldrich&apos;s later hit with Â¨Dirty DozenÂ¨ can be attributed , in part , to this exercice in how not to make a comic western . Here Aldrich directs the slight story at tortoise pace and receives awful performances . This is Aldrich&apos;s absurd contribution to Sinatra clan , following hard on the heels of Â¨Ocean&apos;s elevenÂ¨ , Â¨Robin and the 7 HoodsÂ¨ and Â¨Sergeant 3Â¨ . After a surprising payday for Â¨What ever happened to Baby Jane ?Â¨ , Robert assembled a nice cast and sizeable budget and 2 Euro hotties for what proved one of his dullest films . Aldrich&apos;s first feature film was in 1953 (Big Leaguer ,1953). Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films , collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . He was an expert on warlike genre (Dirty Dozen , The Angry Hills , Ten seconds to hell) and Western (The Frisko kid , Ulzana&apos;s raid, Apache , Veracruz , The last sunset) . Rating : below average . Rating 3.5/10 .",

I&apos;m glad to say at least I didn&apos;t waste my 67 minutes precious time watching (and then passing comment on) rubbish but imho rather a good grade B screwball comedy.\n\nMichael Lanyard (45 year old Warren William&apos;s first of nine films as the reformed cracksman) is being framed by an arch-enemy and his inept gang as part of a plot to steal some secret government plans. For most of the picture he also has to fend off the attentions of his jealous and lively girlfriend Val (21 yo Ida Lupino) and scatty stepdaughter Pat played by the always exuberant Virginia Weidler. Rita Hayworth played baddie Ralph Morgan&apos;s sexy sidekick, but seemed out of place, and I half expected Tom Dugan as the detective to launch into some wacky routine every time he appeared; thankfully he didn&apos;t. And at the surrealist party Lanyard was standing outside the upstairs window simply by means of an elaborate balcony with plenty of climbing plants on show Â so no goof there (as stated in the goofs section) from the Columbia continuity department!\n\nTo fans of this film genre, a pleasure from start to finish, to others, why bother?",

      "reviewBody": "Though a bit slow at the beginning, THE X FROM OUTER SPACE is one of those over-the-top silly Japanese monster movies that they just don&apos;t make anymore and is totally fun to watch because you can&apos;t believe how silly everything is. The film is very juvenile and was most likely made for 5 year old kids more than anyone else.\n\nIf you listen to the dialogue at the beginning of the film, when the astronauts are introduced, there are a lot of double entendres to be heard, like when the man tells a grinning Lisa (Peggy Neal) &quot;However, you are to touch nothing unless specifically authorised by the Captain Sano.&quot; ARF!!! I wonder if the folks who dubbed the film deliberately made it sound so funny.\n\nThe scene on the moon or in space are pretty much pointless but they&apos;re funny nonetheless. The best thing in the movie is the monster itself, Guilala (what a sad name for a monster!). When Guilala attacks, it walks about like a drunken fool, as if it got no clue of what it was doing. Maybe the guy in the suit couldn&apos;t keep his balance because the models were so cheap and fragile. The monster&apos;s roar was really funny to hear. Like someone clearing his throat. When Guilala shoots its fireballs, it looks like he&apos;s burping them out. The whole moment when the monster destroys a building and Lisa gets trapped beneath some rubble, they make a big deal about the fact that her leg is trapped and she&apos;s in pain is priceless because soon afterwards, she walks about like nothing had happened. Another great scene is when Guilala runs after a truck. It&apos;s laugh out loud funny. But the really goofy thing about this film is how fast the characters go from the earth to the moon, and vice versa. It&apos;s like the moon was only a couple of miles away and as easy to access as the nearest shopping mall.\n\n But the film is not all goofiness. When the monster turns into a fireball and flies about Japan, destroying everything in its path, well, the film sorta becomes cool for a fraction of a second. And the ending, when the monster is attacked for the last time, well, I felt bad for the poor old space chicken! But the producers set it up so a sequel was possible. Where&apos;s the sequel? I want to see Guilala battle Baragon. BTW, the container which holds tiny Guilala at the end looks like a camping lamp.\n\nThe worst thing about THE X FROM OUTER SPACE is the music. Aside from the fun song, the actual music used when the monster attacks is basically the same thing played repeatedly over and over. It gets really tiresome."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places&quot; This is the true story about Mike Weiss (Evans) a personal injury lawyer who takes on a huge health supply company after one of his clients is infected with a dirty needle. The client is a nurse in a hospital that uses plastic needles that are re-used over and over. Mike wants to make it so every hospital only uses the one time use only needles that his other client manufactures. The only problem is that Mike is a drug addicted mess. This movie is deceiving. The first half hour to me was a little slow and wasn&apos;t sure if I could make it through. When it picked up, it really picked up and sucked me in. By the end of the movie you are very engrossed and are pulling for someone you normally wouldn&apos;t. A movie much like &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; mixed with &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, not quite as good as &quot;Lincoln Lawyer&quot; though. Overall, a very good law movie that will make you think. I give it a B+.\n\n*Also try - Lincoln Lawyer &amp; Runaway Jury",

Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It&apos;s within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I&apos;ve ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There&apos;s a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven&apos;t seen it, it&apos;s a must!",

However, his latest work is a young female school teacher, but is she really dead or is he fulfilling a sick fantasy.\n\nDirector Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Voslo&apos;s After-life is intriguing, thought provoking and original throughout. The stark style of filming is reminiscent of Body to Body (2003) aka &quot;Corps Ã  corps&quot;. \n\nWhile most of film centres around the character of Anna Taylor it is a wise casting choice by Matthew Lessall as beautiful Christina Ricci gives an emotional performance as a girl who&apos;s is not sure if she is dead or alive. Although, Ricci is on the mortuary slab and semi-nude for most part of the film, comparably to Anna Falchi in Dellamorte Dellamore (1994), to Wojtowicz-Voslo&apos;s credit it&apos;s never in an explicit or over sexualized presentation. \n\nLiam Neeson is convincing as the mortician Eliot Deacon in a subtle performance where he communicates with the dead. He&apos;s creepy and cold, although not given a back story, his character has many layers. The tension between Neeson and Ricci is note-worthy and create some great moments.\n\nDie Hard 4 star Justin Long is average as Ricci&apos;s fiancÃ©e, as he doesn&apos;t have the convincing weight of the other players. However, Young Chandler Canterbury as the little boy Jack is memorable. The supporting cast are a mix of familiar face&apos;s including Josh Charles and Shuler Hensley and the other officers. \n\nDirection, lighting and music create an eerie atmosphere for this effective thriller mystery. There&apos;s horror too in the way of Anna Taylor&apos;s visions and Deacon working on the deceased prepping their bodies.\n\nOverall, simmering entertainment with a closing act to ponder over."

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the previews for this movie, I thought, &quot;Yeah, that looks cool, but... I really didn&apos;t like Gone in 60 Seconds.&quot; I didn&apos;t have the chance to see it in the theater, but I did buy the dvd. All I can say is, it was a good thing that I did! Unlike Gone in 60 Seconds,this movie is much more plot oriented. You need to pay attention to this movie to fully understand the plot. I really don&apos;t see how people can say that this plot is confusing. It makes sense as long as you watch and pay attention, just like all movies. Also, the action scenes are just incredible to watch, especially with the dvd that uses 5.1 sound. The ending and the villains motives will shock you! The movie will also cause you to contemplate many things once the movie has ended. By the way,  Halle Berry looks amazing in the movie!\n\nAll in all this movie is just the epitome of cool, and it was definately one of the better action movies of 2001. Finally Travolta is back at what he does best. As a side note, this is a hell of a lot better then BATTLEFIELD EARTH,which by the way was not as bad as everyone said it was. I really think that you should see this, I don&apos;t think that you will be dissapointed.\n\n9/10 Great."

      "reviewBody": "It was a surprise to see this on Australian TV. It was unheralded but worth staying up late to see the way that the chaos of Keith Richards life was translated into an album of rare if unself-conscious depth. I am constantly amazed by how good the Stones look in retrospect compared to many of their contemporaries. I think Keith is the key to much of it but the link between his ideas and Charlie Watts drums and Bill Wyman&apos;s bass playing is another factor that is highlighted here. Mick Jagger&apos;s casual admission of the cut and paste way that the lyrics flowed together is another revelation. Mick Taylor&apos;s input is of course a highlight. I would have enjoyed seeing him jam with the the other band members for a contemporary take on a couple of the songs.\n\nI was particularly intrigued to hear the out-take of a song called Exile On Main Street at the end of the film. It seems to be a pastiche of bits of lyrics from other songs on the album.\n\nA delightful peek into a world we all wanted to be part of back in the heady days of the early 70&apos;s and into an album that is dense with unexpected rhythms and marvellous slide and saxophone work and a great series of lyrics, made from the detritus of the Stones love affair with America.\n\nThe comments made by the band members and hangers on for this 2010 film are worth the price of admission. The Stones now seem to be able to poke fun at their youthful excess and their more preposterous behaviour and all without a taste of regret or pomposity.",

      "reviewBody": "WARNING: The author of this review loves challenging films.\n\nThey Live is based on a pulp sci-fi story about aliens who live among us and manipulate us through subliminal advertising, other mind control techniques, and sometimes, guns and bulldozers. Like most Carpenter films, its artistic, fun, intelligent and does not take itself too seriously.\n\nAs usual, Carpenter&apos;s casting is brilliant. Roddy Piper plays the good-hearted but not very bright construction worker who is both the hero and protagonist of the film. Keith David, whose character is just a little bit brighter, is his unwilling sidekick. Piper&apos;s character sees some strange goings-on in a local church, hears some weird paranoid ramblings from a street preacher, and becomes especially curious when the church is raided by 30-40 police officers and the vagrant camp where he lives is bulldozed one night. Soon after, he finds a pair of sunglasses in the now abandoned church, that literally changes his view of the world around him. The fight scene between David and Piper, while straight out of TV wrestling, is one of the most jarring and bizarre scenes in the movie - it goes on for a very long time - which nicely and subtly points out its significance in moving the plot forward. When Piper finally gets the sunglasses on David&apos;s face, he is vindicated and the last shred of doubt about his sanity disappears. From that point forward, they are both committed to saving the world from the alien menace. Further description of the plot would approach a spoiler so I won&apos;t go any further. \n\nBoth of the main characters succeed in dominating the screen, to the point that it is hard to even notice the contributions of the rest of the cast. Both actors are surprisingly good, though understandably typecast (these are, after all, two very big guys) but - who the hell is Keith David? look him up here on IMDb.com and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be as surprised at I was. He&apos;s quite an accomplished character actor. \n\nRaymond St Jacques, for all of his five or so minutes of screen time, makes a lasting impression, and Meg Foster is perfect for her ambiguity. Overall, the character development in this film is quite excellent despite the difficulty of pulling it off in a decidedly B sci-fi genre.\n\nFrom an artistic and technical point of view, the film must be judged against Carpenter&apos;s other works. Carpenter has practically created his own film genre, and each of his films bears his mark very clearly. Carpenter&apos;s camera work is remarkable for its unremarkableness. He chooses not to use gimmicks and allows his cameras to tell the story without embellishing it. Like his version of The Thing, this technique fits very well in this film, as it helps the viewer suspend disbelief in what would otherwise seem as ludicrous as an episode of the X-Files. \n\nCarpenter often makes his own soundtracks. Of these, the soundtrack for this film is very good, but terribly repetitive and, after a while, a bit grating. Nevertheless, its goofy redundancy helps to lend a comic edge to the film. \n\nIs there a point?\n\nI would argue that there is. Carpenter is always more interested in fun than poignancy, but he doesn&apos;t shy away from recognizing the value of the material he brings to the screen. Of all of his films, They Live is one of the most overtly political - as it carries some very clever messages about capitalism, conformity, poverty and the horror that everyday life can be for some people. This is all done, however, with a good sense of humor and an almost teenage sense of rebelliousness, all very typically Carpenter. \n\nA great film for B-movie fans, intelligent sci-fi fans and those who enjoy film as an art form.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, let me say I&apos;m a Metallica fan so this review is unevitably biased. But then again, what review isn&apos;t? We all know Metallica are great business men, so the first question that arises is: is this movie a marketing tool? Even though I&apos;m sure the movie will be a commercial success, my answer to the question is no. \n\nMetallica&apos;s record company wanted the movie to accompany Metallica&apos;s 2003 release St. Anger as a weekly series of 30 minute reality TV to get the word out about the album. Metallica not only rejected that idea, but even decided to buy out the record company and release this a year later as a movie instead. We can only thank them for it.\n\nThis movie is certainly not a commercial for Metallica. We get to see the ugly side of Metallica. And it&apos;s ugly alright. We see Lars calling James a dick, shouting &apos;fuck&apos; right in his face and getting drunk while selling his millions of dollars art collection. We see James yelling at Lars, slamming the door, checking in for rehab and after that demanding everyone to only work from 12 to 4. We see Kirk being a sissy the entire movie.\n\nThe title of the movie refers to James; he explains how Metallica has been a beast to him over the years. But Metallica has undoubtedly been a beast to others as well. Dave Mustaine is one of the most successful musicians in heavy metal with his band Megadeth, but apparently is still haunted by him being fired from Metallica. Nevertheless, the movie is ultimately about James&apos; &apos;coming of age&apos;, changing from an angry alcoholic to a man who has managed to balance his personal life with the life in Metallica.\n\nI have one beef with the movie. Around the end Lars says Metallica have proved that it&apos;s possible to make an angry record through positive energy. While I believe him when he says that, I do have to say I hardly saw any of that energy in the movie. In fact, it&apos;s a small miracle they managed to finish the album at all.\n\nEven though not everyone is a fan of Metallica, I can recommend everyone to see this movie. See, this movie is not about the music. It&apos;s about people. People who struggle with themselves, with each other and with the outside world. It&apos;s also a unique look inside the workings (and non-workings) of a world class band and into the lifestyles of the rich and famous. This documentary is a landmark that upstages the album which creation it was originally supposed to document.",

      "reviewBody": "Hans Fallada was one of the most famous German authors of the 20th century. When his novel KLEINER MANN, WAS NUN? (LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?) appeared in English in 1933, Fallada achieved fame in the English-speaking world. But after that, his memory faded, though there has been an attempt at revival of some of his works in English in the past few years. LITTLE MAN was filmed in 1934 in Hollywood by Frank Borzage, with Margaret Sullavan, and has been filmed in German in 1933, 1967, and 1973. This story was the last novel which Fallada wrote before he died prematurely in 1947. Its German title, and the original title of this film, are JEDER STIRBT FÃR SICH ALLEIN. Sometimes it is called in English EVERY MAN DIES ALONE, and sometimes EVERYONE DIES ALONE. It was originally filmed in German for television in 1962, then filmed again for German television in 1970. Then finally it was made into a full feature film with a proper budget in 1976, which is the film reviewed here. At the moment, the novel is being filmed in English under the title ALONE IN BERLIN, with Emma Thompson in the lead, directed by the French director Vincent Perez, for release in 2016. This 1976 film is devastatingly effective and brilliantly done. It succeeds largely because of the astonishing bravura performance in the lead role of Anna Quangel by Hildegard Knef. Knef (who died in 2002, aged 76) was very famous in her day. She appeared in 65 films. She commenced her acting career in 1945 as a young beauty. By the 1950s she had caused something of a sensation in America, appearing in such films as DECISION BEFORE DAWN (1951), DIPLOMATIC COURIER (1952, see my review), THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO (1952), and Carroll Reed&apos;s THE MAN BETWEEN (1953). Americans in those days used to speak of &apos;Hildegard&apos;, not bothering with her surname, and everyone knew whom they meant. In this film, she was 51 years old and very much a middle-aged actress who could not rely upon looks but had to deliver a powerful performance. And that she did! It was one of the finest roles she ever played, full of the most astonishing intensity and anguish. So powerful indeed is her performance that one imagines her having to lie down and recover after each take of several of the more demanding scenes. Emma Thompson certainly has a big challenge ahead of her if she is to come close to equalling Knef&apos;s performance as Anna Quangel. This 1976 film is one of the few German classic films to be available in English as well as German. It does not have subtitles, but is dubbed. Knef dubbed herself, which was essential and makes it work. The other dubbing is so carefully done that it is a highly superior job and does not grate on the ear. The Germans have methodically ploughed through their classic authors, filming everything with their trademark Teutonic thoroughness. Often these take the form of television series or miniseries. They rarely bother to make them available with subtitles, and foreigners never buy them and subtitle them, so a vast library of fabulous drama sits in the German vaults and is known only to the Germans themselves. They have produced far more in quantity of classic drama than the BBC, but nobody knows about it except for the Germans themselves. That seems to suit them just fine. After all, they&apos;ve got their wurst and their sauerkraut, they keep all their best Rhine wines and do not export them, so who needs the rest of the world? Angela Merkel, privately known to all European diplomats as &apos;die Kaiserin&apos; (female form of Kaiser), controls Europe by wagging her little finger, so the Germans really do not need to worry about the outside world, since alles ist in Ordnung. Their currency is strong, their cars are fast, and they certainly know how to &apos;chop the mustard&apos;, as they eat it every day. Meanwhile, so many amazing novels and stories by Thomas and Heinrich Mann, by Leon Feuchtwanger, by Stefan Zweig, by Jakob Wassermann, by Hermann Hesse, und so wieder, have been filmed with loving care, but we just don&apos;t know it (though Hesse&apos;s STEPPENWOLF with Max von Sydow has been released in an English version). As Hans Fallada might have said, &apos;every film is watched by Germans alone&apos;. But back to this one. The story is an astonishing perspective of Nazism as perceived early in the War by the Germans themselves. Knef plays a woman whose son has died in the invasion of France in 1940. Until then she has been a more or less loyal supporter of Hitler, like her husband and all her friends. But then the worm turns. She begins a campaign of writing treasonable messages such as &apos;Hitler killed my son&apos; on postcards which she leaves to be found in public places, until she has flooded Berlin with 221 of them. The Gestapo are jumping mad and see this as a major threat to the Hitler regime&apos;s image of total control. Someone is making monkeys, or should I say lizards, of them. And it has to be stopped at all costs. The tension mounts and mounts and mounts. The investigations intensify, the anxieties rise to a hysterical pitch. The story is a combination of a morality tale, a political satire, and a gruelling human tragedy. The film really is amazing, but you have to be strong to watch it and have nerves that can withstand the pressure. As everything becomes more and more desperate, Hildegard Knef ratchets up her emotional charge to a level where you think all the circuits will blow. Can Emma Thompson possibly equal this? This 1976 film may easily be ordered from German Amazon as a DVD, and in order to switch it to the English language soundtrack, you need to click on &apos;Einstellungen&apos;, which means &apos;settings&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost sublime - this James Bond film had it all, from adventure to romance to thrills. It starts with a shocking electrocution and then into the classic saucy gold credits before the scene is set with Goldfinger himself.\n\nBond, played by dashing Sean Connery for the third time, has to find out what unpleasant gold-smuggling chap named Auric Goldfinger is up to and put a stop to it. He tracks him down first to Geneva then Kentucky in a sparkling sequence of adventures, occasionally involving bumping into Goldfinger&apos;s memorable Korean hatchet-man Oddjob with the odd hat. Favourite bits from so many: short-lived girlfriend Shirley Eaton going for gold; polished Bond being dismissive of the brandy at the Bank Of England much to M&apos;s pleb puzzlement; the debut of the special Aston Martin and Q&apos;s workshop; the narky golf match between Bond and Goldfinger; Bond&apos;s close but rather unnecessary laser shave at Goldfinger&apos;s HQ; his various encounters with feisty Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman); the gangster with the pressing engagement; and Shirley Bassey&apos;s title song was by miles the best Bond song ever.\n\nThe whole film is still a joy, maybe improbable and even ludicrous at times yet I watched it rapt all these years later. It portrays back to us a simpler world though we didn&apos;t know it at the time, a world I can sometimes relate to better than the beautiful perfect world we have now. You don&apos;t need cgi cartoonery, strong sex, extreme violence, so-called realism â or even a sensible story â if you&apos;ve got the right mix of escapism and personality put together by people who enjoy what they&apos;re doing instead of only being in the middle of a franchise.",

      "reviewBody": "Poor Bela Lugosi.  After achieving big-screen stardom in 1931&apos;s &quot;Dracula,&quot; he turned down the role of the Monster in &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; calling the inaudible creature a part for an &quot;idiot&quot; or a &quot;tall extra&quot; (according to William Gregory Manks&apos; fine book on the Frankenstein series, &quot;It&apos;s Alive&quot;). As a result, a bit player named Boris Karloff accepted the part and became the cinema&apos;s number one boogieman, far eclipsing the proud Hungarian actor who would soon be reduced to supporting roles, often second-billed to the lisping Englishman he is often said to have envied and despised.  For Lugosi, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman&quot; may have been more traumatic and embarrassing than the Ed Wood films he would soon be reduced to appearing in, because here the rarely employed actor was cast in the very role he so proudly declined, the role that helped put his more successful rival on the map.\n\n As the Monster, Lugosi is pretty terrible but his ineffective performance was made worse in the editing room where his dialogue was cut out after it was decided that the Monster should not have an Hungarian accent.  Yet Lugosi&apos;s lips move and he flails his arms about as if he were speaking. It&apos;s a rather sad footnote to what is an enjoyable horror yarn, albeit one that was perhaps the first step in turning Universal&apos;s classic horror characters into a joke, ones that would soon have no choice but to meet Abbott and Costello.  What really makes this one memorable is the atmosphere provided by the great and unheralded Roy William Neill, then taking a break from the studio&apos;s Sherlock Holmes series.  This film has a wonderful look that helps make it the best of the later Frankenstein films produced by the studio (although everything after 1939&apos;s &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; represented a steady and steep decline for the series)."

A notable adaptation was Jacques Demy&apos;s 1970 movie starring Catherine Deneuve in the title role.\n\nWell, it turns out that the Soviet Union made its own version of the story. &quot;Oslinaya shkura&quot; (&quot;The Donkey&apos;s Hide&quot; in English) isn&apos;t as flashy as the French version but still has lots of charm. The opening and closing scenes with the paintings added a special element to the storytelling. A number of the scenes come across as more slapstick, especially the scene with the wicked fairy.\n\nI should admit that a number of the scenes made me throw out sarcastic comments like on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. But it&apos;s mostly a good movie. I like seeing the different cultures&apos; perspectives on fairy tales.",

The first scene begins on the dreamingly beach of Nice in South of France where I am going always jogging with my wife in my holidays. Then it dives directly in the second world war time telling how the Jewish people were kept and murdered by the Nazis. DIE FÃLSCHER shows how high talented Jewish forgers have been forced by the SS to work with them. I have now a better view about the development of the German machinery. The movie is well directed with a fast pace and full of turns and twists that led to the Oscar as best foreign film of this year. I have never got bored and I liked it. \n\nThere have been several respectable productions in the last years about the holocaust as for example THE PIANIST, BLACK BOOK, DER UNTERGANG, DIE LETZTEN TAGE DER SOPHIE SCHOLL or DER LETZTE ZUG. Read for all these mentioned movies my reviews.\n\nFinal vote 7/10 and another important DVD for my best of collection.",

If you&apos;re not aware what a Moussaka is just ask the next Greek around, and he will tell you - it&apos;s a very spicy meat dish with lots of vegetable.\n\nIt&apos;s very big in Greece, and even bigger in this very strange movie, as a big Moussaka is blown up to a 20 feet tall monster meal that develops a life on its own and raids the city of Athens by killing several people with it&apos;s deadly, spicy ingredients.\n\nNow it&apos;s the turn of several strange people such as some gays, several drag queen and transsexuals, an female reporter and a bunch of stupidly acting Playboy bunnies from outer space to fight the spicy power...\n\nThis film is really weird, has a really stupid plot, no acting at all and is completely non-thrilling, but it&apos;s fun to watch if you&apos;re into John Water, Russ Meyer, Ed Wood or Roger Corman movies. The film doesn&apos;t take itself seriously at all, and the wooden actors have really fun playing their roles.\n\nNext to the legendary &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot;, there are some nice references to the mentioned trash movie icons, too. The fat transvestite looks like Divine in his/her John Waters comedies and some nice boobs in white bras are shown very Russ-Meyer-like style. The attacking moussaka monster is pasted into the picture like the monsters in an old Jack Arnold or Ray Harryhausen monster movie, and there even a funny reminiscence to Spielberg&apos;s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n\nDon&apos;t expect too much from this movie, except for lots of fun and a healthy appetite for a tasty Greek moussaka afterward.",

I remember that I was like hypnotized by this movie. It was also this film that made me adore Terence Stamp (he is so great in &quot;the Hit&quot; from Stephen Frears, another cult-movie for me). Some scenes are still alive in my mind. Especially when the whole world &quot;prayes&quot; to help the hero fly away through mind-force. It&apos;s a SF story but with a very particular mood. Calm, strange, soft, very bright lights. It&apos;s one of these movies that I really would like to see again (like &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; or &quot;Themroc&quot; that i long to see againÂ). The story has something in common with &quot;Zardoz&quot; from John Boorman. This play with time, eternity, things happening softly, with no stress, no running, and so much weirdness. I also remember the music was aerial. I don&apos;t know if this movie is existing somewhere, if it can be seen or bought but I&apos;d like to.",

The film however was a big disappointment, apart from a great-looking display box, one or two cool character designs and Antoinette who is by default the film&apos;s best character, there is very little to recommend it. I was really disappointed at how a film with as much good promise as it did turned out so pointless and aimless. The animation is mostly very sloppy, with flat colours and most of the characters lack fluidity in how they move. The story lets it down hugely too, there is nothing to it, it is very thin in construction and pedestrian in pace. The only slight sparks are with Antoinette&apos;s appearance and to a lesser extent the action scenes which are disappointingly brief and rushed otherwise. The dialogue plods, the characters are indifferent and static, the music is forgettable and the voice work and lip movements are bland and poor. So overall, a disappointing film and while not the worst animated/anime film I&apos;ve seen The Humanoid belongs down there with the severe letdowns. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Making films based on a concept idea isn&apos;t easy and certainly doesn&apos;t guarantee a good film but I always admire filmmakers for making something different. In &apos;The Human Race&apos; random people get put into a race (or running contest) with very strict rules (we get to hear them 15 times throughout the film) the contestants have to follow or they die. The film seems to be made either by a first time director (he isn&apos;t) or someone who deliberately ignores some basic film rules. The film switches protagonists a couple of times (first one after 9 minutes??) but sometimes it&apos;s to make a point I guess. The Human Race is a bit of a mixed bag: it feels somewhat unbalanced and amateurish on one hand but it does keep you interested and wondering where they are going with the story. I&apos;m sure there are people who will hate this film and/or won&apos;t be happy with the conclusion of the story but I liked it and would recommend it if you like weird concept scifi films. The most comparable film would be CUBE, but that one was an instant classic, this one is a nice try though.",

However, the film gives a summary of the main events from the first film in the beginning. In fact, around eight minutes of the film, which is about an hour and a half long in total, are taken up by this part and the opening credits, which is a lot.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this film with its interesting characters and I do want to watch the first one now.",

      "reviewBody": "Above everything else, this movie is a visual feast that stays true to the cartoon. I think it is really unfortunate that so many critics are complaining about the visuals in this movie, because I think that they are truly fantastic. I can safely say that I have never seen another movie like this one, and I feel that so many movies are going to try to do what this movie did. A lot of the visuals really are beautiful bursts of color similar to what you find on the busy streets of Tokyo, and this movie is aware of that. It is like they took Shibuya and made it a hundred times as big and colorful. Only someone who has been to Tokyo will know exactly what the Wachowskis were going for in this film. After all, it is based on a Japanese TV show.\n\nThe acting is somewhat campy, but can also turn that gear into more serious acting. It can be funny, and then be heartwarming. Lots of the racing sequences are very over the top, but the movie knows it and does it well. The tracks are very creative, and I can only imagine how fun they were to design. If real racing was this exciting, I would watch it all the time. I can understand why this film made the race tracks so crazy, because who would really want to see two hours of regular race tracks with cars going around and around? The sound was also really impressive in this film. The sounds of the race cars were explosive and loud and if you see this movie in a good theater, it will make it that much better. The music is also very fitting and tasteful. Probably the only time I will hear &quot;Freebird&quot; without being annoyed.\n\nAlso the politics in this movie were excellent as well. I feel above all the message of this movie is that money corrupts art. This movie portrays Speed as more of an artist than a race car driver. A big corporation wants to sponsor Speed, but Speed knows that corporations are evil and are only looking to make more money. He is very dedicated to his craft, and does not want to sell out. Speed knows that corporations corrupt art, and so does this movie. You will not see one piece of product placement in this whole film.\n\nSo overall this movie is very self-aware. It wants to entertain, and it does exactly that. It wants to be different, and it does exactly that. Don&apos;t listen to those wimpy critics that didn&apos;t like this film because it gave them a headache. Many people said the same thing about Moulin Rogue, and that movie is fantastic too. Critics who complained about there being too much color should have brought a pacifier with them to the movies, because only babies would complain about how this film looks. Race to your theater to see it now.",

      "reviewBody": "In this nearly terrifying age where our children are growing significantly faster than we want them to, fear, anxiety, and near paranoia starts to overtake the best of parents. In America, we have witnessed, in this generation alone, some of the most evil ever conducted by mankind in all of history; the fall of the twin towers, the war in Iraq, the shooting massacre in Virginia Tech, all terrible staples in my memory and I&apos;m not even thirty yet. What other horrors will this lifetime bring? As a new father, I want to wrap my daughter Sophia in a bubble and never let her see the light of day for fear of what she may either endure or be influenced by. Shawn Ku&apos;s Beautiful Boy examines the aftermath of a young man, Sammy, that commits a mass shooting at his school and ultimately takes his own life. Bill (Michael Sheen) and Kate (Maria Bello) are your average married couple. Held back by grief, guilt, and rage, Bill and Kate undertake the scrutiny from the presses and the families as the sole reasons for young Sammy&apos;s demise. How could you move on from a nightmare you couldn&apos;t wake up from? Ku takes on the story with ferocity, examining a vast subject, which perks our ears up and raises our eyebrows. Ultimately Ku fails at getting down to the emotional center of this tale. The narrative picks up rather quickly from the beginning but loses pace and theme quickly. It&apos;s not necessarily a failure on Ku&apos;s part or co-writer Michael Armbruster, simply not as evolutionary in terms of independent filmmaking. The premise is enticing enough to withstand its flaws and it does have moments of brilliance, especially in the scenes following the shooting. However, it&apos;s the powerful performances of Michael Sheen and Maria Bello that hook the viewer in and safely guide throughout. Michael Sheen delivers his finest performance since his towering work in Stephen Frears&apos; The Queen. Sheen attacks the character unlike anything seen from him before. He is engaged and delivers the emotional peril of a heartbroken father attempting to pick up the pieces in the most magnificent ways possible. Sheen invites the viewer into his world, showing the ugliest and worst parts about him, and letting us form our own opinion. Downright brilliant. Maria Bello, who I fell in love with in David Cronenberg&apos;s A History of Violence, handles Kate with care, love, and ease. Bello&apos;s precision and dedication to the craft stands nearly on the top of most actresses today. It also equals one of her finest works in years. Her heart-on- the-sleeve approach not only allows us to respect Kate but it transforms her into a clear sign and example of masterclass acting. Where it can easily be taken over the top, Bello holds it right to the edge, never pushing us over. In a rare and personal plea, these two performances should well be on the Oscar radar. As a small and obviously personal film, Michael Sheen and Maria Bello deliver clear and cut, two of the most worthy performances of award&apos;s recognition this year. It&apos;s reminiscent of the same feeling Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams delivered in their powerful works in last year&apos;s Blue Valentine. In his briefest scenes, Kyle Gallner (Sammy) boils his performance to the rim and delivers a clever and daring performance. Beautiful Boy has raw and emotional power without falling all over itself with melodrama, but it does come up short in some narrative regards. But with these two talented actors in tow, the film will knock your socks right off in simple artistry.\n\nRead more reviews at Awards Circuit dot com."

When Jarecki was asked in PC why he did not release the film during the election, he steadfastly stated that the film was not about Bush bashing, but was about trying to show the American public how democracy works, (both pro and con). I do not usually get worked up about a film or politics, but after viewing this film a year ago, I have talked about it continuously and it&apos;s lessons to all who are willing to listen. I steadfastly believe that this film should be shown in the classroom to educate, and perhaps forewarn our youth about being vigilant of our sometimes overreaching capitalistic tendencies. This is coming from an individual who has enjoyed the bounties of capitalism, but got a wakeup call. GO SEE THIS FILM!",

The plot is simple and very easy for kids to follow along with the adventure. My daughter loved the movie! Just a heads up-Carlito the main boy character who is about 13 takes off his clothes to dry them after falling in a river. He is seen naked from behind while he hangs his wet clothes up. Once he realizes the girls are spying on him, he turns around and covers himself with a backpack for the rest of the scene. (It&apos;s implied that they see everything, although we don&apos;t see everything). The scene lasts about a minute and is very innocent. The scene does jump out at you though, since he is clothed and then the very next shot he is naked. My daughter had not been expecting to see that much of the main actor!! But all in all it was a lovely film with a wonderful message. We recommend!",

Stuck in town he finds a new friend and from there things start rolling.\n\nFilms about families with scars and pockmarks work out the best when their problems are believable and this film works that out very well. With each passing day the bonds between the various people are worked out more clearly and become easier to believe. Once the party is finally there all comes together and the ending can only be the way it is. It&apos;s not entirely dark, not entirely light, but entirely true and therefore its good.\n\n8 out of 10 silent nights",

      "reviewBody": "Imagine NASA making a documentary about a hypothetical exploration of Jupiter&apos;s moon, Europa. Now add elements of high drama to make the documentary a little more entertaining. Et voilÃ ! Europa Report.\n\nIn many respects this film reminded me of 2010:The Year We Make Contact: It has much of the feel of 2001 but the decision making, along with the science, is less credible than 2001. So that&apos;s about the same as 2010. The film is based on our actual scientific knowledge of Europa which is a big plus for the film.\n\nEuropa Report is presented as a retrospective assessment by a mission controller on Earth. It is well done but somewhat flat and predictable. The attempts at drama are equally flat and predictable.\n\nSo how to sum up? Europa Report is a well crafted movie and you can easily imagine this is an actual space mission. It makes a refreshing change from space soap operas and silly adventure films like Armageddon. However it will appeal most to scientists, engineers, teachers and those with a genuine interest in space exploration. If all you want is another episode of Star Wars you should look elsewhere, but personally I kinda liked this movie. Of course I&apos;m an engineer.",

      "reviewBody": "At the height of the Nazi occupation of Poland in 1942, this tells us a story of war with a slightly different slant. It takes up the cudgels of the youth whose innocence was well and truly stripped away by their oppressors and illustrates just how tough it was to grow up in any sort of a natural fashion when guns were everywhere and freedom-fighting the order of the day. That is exemplified here by &quot;Stach&quot; (Tadeusz Lomnicki). He grew up in the Warsaw equivalent of a shanty town, with his mother, and learned to live on a combination of wits and strength. He falls in with some communist resistance fighters at work and that&apos;s where he meets &quot;Dorota&quot; (Urszula Modrzynska) whom he begins a relationship with whilst perils mount outside. The killing of an officer by his close friend &quot;Jacek&quot; (Ryszard Kostas) makes matters much more intense and with their enemy now firmly focussed on the group, it becomes even more dangerous and lonely for an increasingly angry and frustrated &apos;Stach&quot;. Andrzej Wajda manages to use the tightly knit cast here to create a drama that&apos;s entirely plausible of a society struggling to retain any semblance of it&apos;s freedoms and principles in the face of an overwhelming and hostile government. He uses the character of &quot;Stach&quot; cleverly to contrast his vulnerability and, at times even childishness, with his courage and his desires. This also shows us a bit of the enemy of any enemy is my friend philopsohy as people with little in common find themselves (temporarily) allied to combat a common foe safe in the knowledge that each are the other&apos;s next foe down the line in due course. Like most of the best films to depict events of WWII, this uses the ordinariness of the people to fight it&apos;s corner well. Decent people who were not trained killers, indeed here they are barely out of school, yet they adapt to the wreckage of their city; reduced to huddling in corners or ruins or sewers that are darkly lit and photographed as if these very sets were terrified. This is a tough watch and it tests humanity in many of it&apos;s guises as it depicts a sort of hope from hopelessness - but without any danger of rose covered cottages, or cherry pie endings.",

      "name": "Great film - sad story",
      "reviewBody": "It was great to see Greg Kinnear in another flawless performance; here as Dr. Bob Kearns, inventor and professor. To me, I think of Mr. Kinnear as sort of the cocker spaniel of American actors. Perfectly companionable for just about everyone. He just feels right in so many roles it&apos;s hard to imagine anyone else having done them. This is another instance of his having added immeasurably to what may have otherwise been a more uninteresting character. After all, it&apos;s hard to imagine anyone making an engineer or professor seem interesting; but in this outing Kinnear certainly accomplishes that.\n\nAdding her own note of quiet grace and perfect screen presence, Lauren Graham as Phyllis Kearns gives her character both charm and great heart, not to mention that she looks better in a plain white nightgown that just about anyone I&apos;ve seen... well, except for my wife, of course.\n\nThere are other great performances here too, like Mitch Pileggi as the bad guy from any corporation in America, Tim Kelleher as his greasier side-kick and Dermot Mulroney as a slightly smarmy friend of Kearnes&apos;. Likewise the hoard of young actors playing the Kearns children added a perfect familial note to the vehicle.\n\nBut, more than any of these fine people, the focal point here was the story as it always is in these social consciousness melodramas. Yes, Virginia. The wheels of American industry is greased with the bones of the cheated and betrayed genius of America. That is so universally true it&apos;s a well known sub-plot to all of America&apos;s engineers and manufacturers. What is also well known is what happens when they try to find justice, let alone an iota of truth; which is so accurately and skillfully portrayed in this film.\n\nSpeaking as an engineer who has worked in American industry for over 40 years, I can say that I have seen this more times than I can count. It goes on every day right here under your noses, America, and no one ever does a thing to change the way America fails to protect her fragile genius. That is deliberately so. That is so because the laws America uses to define how these things are handled are made by lawyers, for lawyers. It would cease to be profitable if the laws were crafted to actually protect it&apos;s most precious resource - it&apos;s creative people. But it&apos;s not; the laws are instead crafted to provide fat and frequent paychecks to every leach that slithers through the &quot;halls of justice&quot;.\n\nJust as Kearns did, I had to learn the hard way that justice in America belongs only to those with a fat enough wallet to buy it through the local outlet. If you don&apos;t have the six figures to hire a lawyer then you have no rights and no freedom in this country. Like a Wildebeest grazing blissfully in the middle of the herd, you have only not been awakened to that fact yet because no one has yet decided to attack you, or steal from you.\n\nThis has been the long way around to tell you that the creators of the film got it exactly right, with one serious flaw... for every Bob Kearns who has eviscerated themselves to win a Pyrrhic victory of the sort we witness here, there have been thousands who have given up for being too shallow in pocket or too short of mental fortitude or too short of the desire for self-flagellation required to press through to an empty, moral victory.\n\nAnd even here, we see unmistakably that this &quot;victory&quot; costs Kearns what he valued most in his life. He didn&apos;t even live to see himself depicted as &quot;heroic&quot; in this fine film.\n\nStill, thank you Bob, wherever you are.",

      "reviewBody": "Ever see a film that you knew deep down was bad, but you were able to suspend your usual beliefs about what a good movie should be and enjoy it anyway? Meet BLIND RAGE, a low-budget &apos;70s anti-masterpiece.\n\nThe plot is highly original, if not ridiculous. Five blind men are assembled to rob a bank in broad daylight. Why? Because who would ever suspect blind men of robbing a bank? (Well, there&apos;s a bit more to it than that, but I won&apos;t spoil it for you). The group of visually-impaired thieves (no, you&apos;ve never heard of any of the actors) is carefully trained in a mock bank by the lovely Sally (Leila Hermosa, who later landed a coveted role in the highly acclaimed BONGGA KA DAY). But can they pull it off? Well, this is a dumb &apos;70s movie, isn&apos;t it?\n\nBLIND RAGE isn&apos;t rife with so-bad-it&apos;s-good humor, but it certainly has its moments. I&apos;ll never forget the badly-dubbed scene where one of the blind dudes breaks up an attempted sexual assault by another. In a voice with about as much emotion as Eeyore before coffee, our hero orders the aggressor to &quot;Get off her... sex hungry bastard.&quot; Then there&apos;s the hilarity of desperate producers trying to pass this off as a Fred Williamson actioneer. They don&apos;t tell you that Freddy doesn&apos;t show up until about the last 20 minutes (though he is vintage cigar-chomping Williamson once he finally arrives).\n\nIf this review has at all piqued your interest in BLIND RAGE, you&apos;re definitely a candidate for enjoying it. (Though you&apos;ll probably have to scour eBay to find it).",

A truly good, almost genial performance of Nela Erzisnik."

One of his earlier films, &quot;El Dia De La Bestia&quot; aka. &quot;The Day Of The Beast&quot; of 1995 is a perfect example for this director&apos;s talent, a macabre and hilarious black horror comedy that entertains highly from the beginning to the end. A catholic priest (Ãlex Angulo) goes to Madrid in order to prevent the birth of the Antichrist, which he believes to take place there on Christmas Day. In order to find the exact place where the Antichrist is to be born, the kind-hearted priest is forced to commit &apos;Sins&apos;, and furthermore associates with the surprisingly friendly Death-Meal lover and Satanist Jose Maria (Santiago Segura)... Angulo and Segura both fit very well in their roles, especially Angulo is very hilarious as the priest. Armando De Razza is furthermore great, and hilarious as Cavan, a hypocritical TV psychic. Director De La Iglesia did a great job making this film a hilarious Horror-comedy and still maintaining a dark and somehow gloomy atmosphere. If you like satirical Horror, make sure not to miss &quot;El Dia De La Bestia&quot;, and enjoy 100 minutes of macabre humor and originality. Highly Recommended!",

It&apos;s funny and touching.\n\nScarlett does a good job - this is the first movie I really liked her in. She is not afraid of looking unglamorous if the role requires it.\n\nComparing this with Devil Wears Prada - I think this is more realistic, funny and moving. Linney is good as always - doesn&apos;t overact. Paul Giamatti is a bit unlikely as a successful finance person. Should have chosen someone a bit more executive like. Alicia Keyes is a bit out of place as the friend - too pretty.",

      "reviewBody": "Made by some of the same folks who worked on the great Outer Limits television series, this little-known gem (shot entirely in Esperanto, a language conceived to become a universal dialect in the late 19th Century) is definitely one-of-a-kind and worth checking out. William Shatner stars as war vet and all-around good and decent guy who lives with his sister (some Freudian implications are present) in a nameless and nearly-vacant coastal village. He is briefly led astray by a seductive, blonde devil-worshipper (Allyson Ames) under false pretenses...he thinks it&apos;s for the mutual attraction and she is basically plotting to kill him and deliver another soul over to Satan. \n\nThe remastering job is a crystal clear b/w print, gorgeously shot by Conrad L. Hall (AMERICAN BEAUTY) around picturesque Big Sur locations. Director Leslie Stevens achieves some amazing shots, throws in some great camera-work and the films has faint echoes of CARNIVAL OF SOULS and many Mario Bava films. The plotting (Shatner falling in love in the course of an afternoon and some heavy-handed religious themes) is often at odds with the is lyrical and poetic tone of the film, but it has many standout sequences (including a winged demon seen only in shadow, a solar eclipse, the human &quot;incubus&quot; rising from the grave, an opening murder of the succubus drowning a drunken man in the ocean...) to recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Quite a few bad things have been written about A Bridge Too Far. Richard Attenborough&apos;s elephantine recreation of the battle for several strategically valuable Dutch bridges in the winter of 1944 is a star-studded, lengthy and exhausting film (and many critics at the time seemed to be of the opinion that it collapsed beneath its own weight). Almost thirty years on, the film is now viewed somewhat more favourably. It may feel 30 minutes too long, and the need for so many stars in so many tiny parts is questionable, but A Bridge Too Far successfully shows a fierce episode of the Second World War in all its chaotic glory. Incredibly, there&apos;s no use of the computer generated effects during the big battle scenes that it is relied upon in modern films like Gladiator and Troy. The scenes in this film were shot pretty much as you see them - so the 35,000 parachutists storming Holland, the river crossing led by Robert Redford under intense enemy fire, and other such staggering combat sequences were filmed with thousands of extras and a good deal of meticulous planning and preparation.\n\nThe film is based upon Operation Market Garden, an Allied plot hatched towards the end of 1944 with the intention of ending the war in Europe. The concept behind the plan was to drop 35,000 soldiers into Holland approximately 60 miles beyond the German lines, to seize six vital bridges, and to reinforce the paratroopers by sending in thousands of ground troops. However, various mishaps jeopardised the mission and eventually the Allies were cut off and had to withdraw, suffering severe losses.\n\nAs stellar casts go, A Bridge Too Far still takes some rivalling. Among the many famous actors involved, these are just a few: Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Ryan O&apos;Neal, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins and Elliott Gould. It seems pointless for some of the actors to be cast in these roles - true enough, Connery, Bogarde and Hopkins get decent roles and a fair bit of screen time, but was it really worth paying Redford $2,000,000 for his ten minute heroics? Could a decent actor have not handled the role for a fraction of that amount? Is Gene Hackman really the correct choice for Polish officer Major General Stanislaw Sosabowski? Should a light comic actor like Elliott Gould be doing his cigar-chomping &quot;fun&quot; turn in a movie as serious as this?\n\nLuckily, the film is a big success on other levels. The cinematography is extraordinary; the music is suitably stirring; the potentially confusing story is handled with clarity and true-to-the-facts sensitivity; and amid the chaos a number of very memorable scenes emerge. A Bridge Too Far is a very good war film - maybe the biggest war film ever conceived (The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan included) - and I feel that, although it has a few casting flaws, it is in almost every other department a great, great achievement.",

Though the theme of this movie is the birth of Islam, I think it should have a variety of audience from many religions and cultures. I think the things that are emphasized, the struggle for the cause you believe, the sacrifices you have made for the beloved, are all universal values that have been emphasized with a rather outstanding casting and directing...I think everyone should watch this movie no matter what his/her religion, thought, culture is...

The whole mood is set from the incredible opening credits sequence and all throughout the film. Gordon Liu is Yang #6; a man bent on seeking revenge.  His pole fighting is amazing in this one in both battle and training.  You cannot miss the scene when he enters the Shaolin temple - classic Liu!!\n\nAlexander Fu Sheng as Yang #5 gives a great performance as man driven insane from traumatic events.  Although it&apos;s english dubbing, Fu Sheng&apos;s facial expressions and acting is really great in this one...he really looks crazy!! I enjoyed seeing his panic attacks being doused by Mother Yang who&apos;s not too shabby a fighter herself.  Kara Hui is Yang #8 and her fight scenes are always a sight to see!  Oh, Lau Kar Leung&apos;s cameo is short, but is wickedly intense!\n\nOverall, this has become a favorite of mine.  Whether it&apos;s the pole training in the wolf room, the final battle, or those deadly coiling staffs, I could watch this one again and again and...",

      "reviewBody": "As I watched this film, I kept asking myself: What&apos;s the killer&apos;s motivation(s)? Not until the last few minutes did that become clear Â well, as clear as it could be, given the narrative structure: reminiscent of the plot of Se7en (1995) but with the addition of a number of flashbacks that do more to confuse than to wholly satisfy.\n\nAnd, there are obvious nods to not only Se7en, but Silence of the lambs (1991), also, particularly the cinematography and scene construction. At one point, echoing a scene from the former, Detective Cho (Suh-kyu Han) is lying exhausted in a rain-soaked alley way, while the killer sits waiting in his car, only two metres away; but instead of running Cho down, the killer screams away into the rain. In another scene, Cho is in an elevator and looks up to see bright blood dripping from the hatchway, and then also dripping down the wall; suddenly, the hatch breaks and buckets of blood cascade onto him. Add to that are the many interior scenes in run-down tenements and so forth, all evocative of the spooky corridors of those earlier films.\n\nStill, the story is interesting, in a macabre way: across Seoul, body parts turn up in black plastic bags, but not all parts belong to the body. Somebody is perpetrating murder piecemeal. Enter Detective Cho, somewhat under suspicion for corruption but handed the case as way to redeem his career. More mixed-up body parts are discovered, but no hands with fingerprints. So, no clues. Until a head appears with teeth fillings that can be traced. One thing leads to another until Cho finds himself knocking on the door to Chae Su-Yeon (Eun-ha Shim), a young woman who knows all the male victims.\n\nAnd so begins the real mystery for Cho - and the viewer. Through questioning and a series of flashbacks, it looks like Chae is in the frame; yet, murders continue while she is under surveillance. Suspicion falls upon her father, who, from Chae&apos;s account, is shown to be a sadistic, authoritarian figure; but he can&apos;t be found. And then there&apos;s a further nod to another thriller, Kiss the girls (1997), where the idea of a deadly duo is raised and then quashed when a prime suspect is himself reduced to a jumble of parts in a bag. All very messy for Cho, and increasingly so, because he appears to be attracted to the sweet Chae Su-Yeon, a complication he can do without, you would think.\n\nIn a way, I can also compare this film to the manner in which David Lynch constructs his films. When you see any of the more recent Lynch films, the real mystery (and challenge) is how to understand the story. For Tell Me Something, the problem is how to understand the mystery because, as I said, the killer&apos;s motivation(s) is the key. And yet, at the end, there is no absolute clarity, even though the identity is obvious. So if I provide my understanding here and now, I think that would detract from the pleasure of unraveling it for yourself. Meanwhile, I&apos;ll continue to ponder the significance of the title, the significance of which escapes me.\n\nHowever, the production is excellent and the special effects (dismembered bodies, body pieces, heads, gutted torsos and so on) are so realistic they may cause some people more than just some discomfit. It will certainly satisfy the slash-and-gore set who liken this movie to Italian giallo cinema, exemplified by Dario Argento&apos;s works such as Deep Red (1977), Tenebre (1982) and others. It&apos;s classified as a horror film and I think that&apos;s justified, given the underpinnings of the story and the camera work.\n\nI can&apos;t comment much on the acting as I&apos;m not familiar with the actors or Korean cinema, having seen only a few; generally, however, I think the actors performed quite well.\n\nRecommended for those who like a mixed bag of horror, mystery and thriller...and body parts.",

At least this Heimatfilm does not take itself seriously.\n\nIt is thÃ t fast-paced that it never lets the viewer be aware of the improbabilities of the genre. Cast is fine and certainly game for this joke; very well directed by old hand Harald Reinl. One disappointment: the four beautiful legs of the Kessler Twins are partly covered by Lederhosen!",

      "reviewBody": "Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980&apos;s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80&apos;s, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70&apos;s &quot;The Town the Dreaded Sundown&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Shinji Somai is well known in Japan but largely forgotten elsewhere. His films are however of a high quality. Maybe his early death in 2001 at the age of 53 or the fact that his films are somewhere in between arthouse and commercial mainstream has contributed to his fall into oblivion.\n\nFortunately the Filmmuseum Amsterdam re-released three of his films recently. Like many other Somai films they portray youthful characters. In &quot;P. P. Rider&quot; (1983) and &quot;Typhoon club&quot; (1985, a darker version of &quot;The breakfast club&quot; (also 1985, John Hughes)) the young characters are of high school age. In &quot;Moving&quot; (1993) the young character has the age of elementary school. &quot;P. P. Rider&quot; and &quot;Typjoon club&quot; were only shown in Amsterdam, &quot;Moving&quot; got a nationwide re-release.\n\n&quot;Moving&quot; is seen through the eyes of Renko, whose parents are in the early stages of divorce. There are other films about divorce. &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979, Robert Benton) is seen largely from the points of view of the parents while in &quot;Loveless&quot; (2017, Andrey Zvyagintsev) the boy is a rather passive victim of the divorce.\n\nRenko is a victim in the sense that she misses her father, but she is anything but passive. In the film she runs (away) a lot. On the one hand to get rid of her frustration, on the other hand to give her parents a a shared problem that might bring them closer together again. It is up to the viewer to decide which of the two interpretations he/she chooses.\n\nThe brilliancy of the film resides however towards the end, when the film quit suddenly changes from rather down to earth to somewhat mythical. This ending is situated during a Japanese fire festival. I suspect I would have liked the second half of the film even more woud I have known more about the meaning of this festival. Even without this knowledge however the sudden shift to magical realism was great in itself.",

      "description": "Opens August 2nd at Film at Lincoln Center.\n\nNew 4K restoration of the beloved Shinji Somai classic, never before released in North America.\n\nWhen her parents split and her father Kenichi moves out of their family home, Renko (Tomoko Tabata), a bright and energetic 6th grade girl, is left alone with her mother, Nazuna, in Kyoto. As Nazuna sets out new rules for their life together, Renko makes plans of her own, and sees to it that any changes happening in her family happen on her terms. Since its premiere at Cannes in Un Certain Regard in 1993, Moving has been one Shinji Somai&apos;s most beloved films. In this poignant family drama, Somai transcends the tropes of stories of children dealing with divorce to bring us a film filled with indelible images about an unforgettable teenage girl who encounters the unknown and refuses to succumb to it.\n\nRevered by the likes of Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Shinji Somai was a monumental figure of Japanese cinema in the 1980s and beyond, whose body of work bridged the collapse of the studio system and the rise of a new generation of independent filmmakers. In a lively career tragically cut short (he completed 13 films before his untimely death in 2001, aged 53), Somai developed a singular way of working, characterized by his signature long-take style and the highly physical performances of his actors, who were usually young and unknown. Disrupting the usual flow of narrative, Somai&apos;s camera ventured out into space to match the volatility of his performers, provoking them along in a dance at once precisely designed and wholly off-the-cuff. Five of Somai&apos;s works, including Typhoon Club and Moving, are ranked among Kinema Junpo&apos;s greatest Japanese films of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Volver&apos; starts at a cemetery where the women are cleaning the graves on a windy day. Young mother Raimunda (Cruz), who after attending her mother&apos;s grave, finds herself widowed, thanks to her daughter. Her sister, Sole (Lola Duenas) sees a ghost of her dead mother and their battling-with-cancer friend Augustina is in search of her own truth about her mother. Almodovar&apos;s colourful canvas is a wonderful portrait of women in Spain. Though it is a colourful portrait, it&apos;s dark but somewhat humorous and appealing. Almodovar tells the story in a sensible but somewhat simpler tone. There are some shocking revelations but &apos;Volver&apos; does not dwell on any one particular incident. It&apos;s the story of the women.\n\nPenelope Cruz gives one of her finest performances. It&apos;s been evident in her recent film choices (that also include &apos;Bandidas&apos; that she&apos;s experimenting with different roles. As Raimunda, she speaks her mind, she&apos;s energetic, she&apos;s brave and a risk taker but at the same time she&apos;s vulnerable and is hiding a dark &apos;shameful&apos; secret. Lola Duenas&apos;s Sole is a loner (but she loves her sister and niece). She&apos;s independent and satisfied with her life. The actress does nothing short of a great job. Carmen Maura is equally great as the &apos;ghost&apos; bringing lots of laughter but even during Irene&apos;s own vulnerable sad moments she is outstanding. Portillo&apos;s Agustina, is a quieter lonely character who loves the sisters. The actress skillfully underplays her part and her immense talent is especially evident in the darkly humorous and somewhat sad talk-show scene. Like Almodovar&apos;s &apos;Todo Sobre Mi Madre&apos;, &apos;Volver&apos; is about distinctive female characters and the viewer loves these women and feel involved in their stories.\n\nLike most Almodovar&apos;s films, the soundtrack is part of the narration that adds to his slightly weird chaotic world. Similarly, Iglesias&apos;s score brings out the richness of the atmosphere created by the wonderful cinematography (thanks to excellent photography). The Spanish streets, the vivacious culture is just presented in Almodovar&apos;s unique style.\n\n&apos;Volver&apos; is witty, warm, funny, colourful, disturbing, uplifting and lightly dark with a well told story and lovable characters portrayed wonderfully by the actresses."

I am a massive fan of Jimmy Page and Jack White - Led Zeppelin is my favourite band, and the White Stripes would be amongst my favourites, plus I liked U2 when they made good music, i.e. until about 1989. So what was the problem?\n\nIt just felt a bit empty in the end. Like, so what? Maybe it is that I have seen just about every rock documentary ever made that made the guitarists&apos; revelations seem a bit empty.\n\nAlso, the mutual back-slapping got a bit tiresome.\n\nThis all said, there was a lot of great stuff in here. Hearing Jimmy Page talk about how he got into playing guitar, his early bands, showing us the spot where John Bonham played the amazing drum-intro on When The Levee Breaks (which explained the unique sound to that track), seeing some of Jack White&apos;s pyrotechnics, The Edge talking us through the technology he uses in producing his sound, and hearing the sound.",

      "reviewBody": "I had always been interested in checking out this seafaring thriller due to Bela Lugosi&apos;s involvement; still, now I can&apos;t help feeling that the over-age star was miscast in the role of a hapless &apos;old man of the sea&apos; who bears an Ahab-like grudge against the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; and is also something of a religious fanatic (the inspiration for this was, perhaps, Boris Karloff&apos;s impressive turn in John Ford&apos;s desert adventure THE LOST PATROL [1934]). That said, his final descent into madness (uncommonly vicious for the time but, then, the film is based on a factual incident!) is fairly well handled.\n\nUltimately, however, the British-made picture fails to rise above its &apos;quota quickie&apos; status - Lugosi himself fared much better with the later DARK EYES OF London (1939) - and can&apos;t honestly compare with the similar Val Lewton-produced THE GHOST SHIP (1943); moreover, it is fatally compromised by the director&apos;s baffling decision to keep much of the central action off-screen (either due to budgetary limitations or he must have been an admirer of Tod Browning)! Considering some of the choppy editing involved, though, I&apos;m inclined to believe the film&apos;s official length as given by the IMDb - i.e. 80 minutes, rather than the 62-minute version I saw (culled from the Image DVD).\n\nThere&apos;s also the insipid - but mandatory - romantic interest to contend with here, to say nothing of various songs by the leading lady (with piano accompaniment) and an organ-playing sailor, which are a chore to sit through...but the latter musical instrument&apos;s come-uppance at the hands of the angry first mate does provide some unintended hilarity!\n\nP.S. Though it hadn&apos;t been officially named as yet, the company that made this film is actually Hammer Films; as a matter of fact, I first came upon PHANTOM SHIP (under its original title of THE MYSTERY OF THE MARY CELESTE) via a still in an article about the famed British &quot;House Of Horror&quot; in an early 1980s periodical...",

      "reviewBody": "First glance of DÃ©jÃ  Vu&apos;s DVD cover presents what appears to be another action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that, they can&apos;t all be &quot;Agent PW&quot; (Peewee Herman), but with the oversaturation of such action flicks it&apos;s easy to let one slip past you. Then I noticed who directed this film: the late, great Tony Scott.\n\nTony Scott committed suicide by jumping off a bridge in 2012. We&apos;ll get to that in a minute. First let&apos;s go back in time, as this movie does (speaking of which, here&apos;s all you need to know about DÃ©jÃ  Vu&apos;s plot in 1 sentence: the movie opens with a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, and the remaining 121 minutes take our hero on a wild ride to unravel the truth and possibly... change it?).\n\nTony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott (&quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;), was just as stylish and atmospheric with his films. Although best known for the more mainstream &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, he first turned heads with his phenomenal debut &quot;The Hunger&quot;, which was to vampire flicks what Kubrick&apos;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was to scifi flicks. It brought a degree of sobriety and realism to a genre dominated by fantasy and cheesy special effects. Or in other words: &quot;sh!t gets real.&quot;\n\nHere in DÃ©jÃ  Vu, we get the same sober treatment of &quot;time travel&quot; movies. It&apos;s not just Marty McFly flooring a suped up Delorean and cruising into the past. Rather, we are presented the somewhat credible idea of being able to observe the past in real-time, similar to the way our telescopes allow us to observe the past of stars unfolding in real-time even though they have burned out billions of years ago. That&apos;s about all we get as far as explanations which I think is good. Nobody wants to spend 15 minutes talking about flux capacitors and stuff when people are about to get killed.\n\nThe action doesn&apos;t let up for a single moment. That doesn&apos;t mean that there are continuous car chases and shootouts, but what I mean is that there&apos;s a thick air of tension that Tony Scott achieves even during quiet moments because there is always a sense of impending peril. Take the opening 5 minutes, for example. Even if you hadn&apos;t read the IMDb description (which I always advise people not to!) and even if I hadn&apos;t told you that there&apos;s a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, you can feel something is going to happen because that&apos;s what Tony Scott conveys to us from the 1st frame.\n\nA quick word about the acting, even though it should be obvious with Denzel Washington: fantastic. He reprises his signature action role of a loner who&apos;s somewhat cynical but not above showing tremendous humanity and compassion in addition to explosive outbursts. He also adds some great comedic moments, although most of the film&apos;s comic relief is handled by the excellent Adam Goldberg (remember Chandler&apos;s psycho roommate for 3 episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;?) who plays the fast talking, sarcastic, pop-culture-quoting computer nerd &quot;Denny&quot; who throws out zingers referencing everything from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to &quot;Airplane!&quot; Now back to director Tony Scott and his suicide (you thought I had forgotten).\n\nThe undisputed power of this film is carried by its mystery. I&apos;m not just talking about whodunnit, but more importantly: whydunnit? Powerful themes of fatalism vs. free will, acceptance vs. action, and even a tasteful dose of logic vs. spiritualism are thrown at us around every corner. The result is a thriller where we can&apos;t figure out the director&apos;s strategy or motive until the very last scene. Some filmmakers are somewhat predictable (you always know Disney will end happy, you always know John Carpenter will end with a few gallons of blood). But here Tony Scott plays with his cards so close to his chest, and not only that but he fakes us out quite a few times, that your fingernails will be deeply imprinted in the armrest of your chair or the flesh of the unlucky person sitting next to you. And isn&apos;t that how Tony Scott left this world? An unexplained suicide (although some family members mentioned a secret battle with cancer, the coroner&apos;s official report showed no cancer, no serious medical conditions), the only thing that everyone could agree on was that Tony&apos;s leap from the bridge was &quot;inexplicable&quot;. Who knows, maybe watching this film will give you some insight into the mind of the great director. Perhaps coincidentally, a bridge figures into this movie as a prominent symbol.\n\nWho knows, maybe you just wanted to watch a run-of-the-mill action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. But there&apos;s so much more here. DÃ©jÃ  Vu will definitely make you do a double-take."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Seventh Seal&apos; is universally regarded as a masterpiece. It&apos;s one of those classics like &apos;Citizen Kane&apos;, &apos;Rear Window&apos; or &apos;The Godfather&apos; that has subtlety entered popular culture, so even if you haven&apos;t actually seen it you recognize references to it in other movies, TV, magazines and everyday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and &apos;Rashomon&apos; and &apos;Sunset Blvd&apos; it isn&apos;t regarded as a masterpiece for nothing, it really is one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by &apos;The Seventh Seal&apos;. It&apos;s still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Visually it&apos;s stunning, the acting is first rate, and the end result is mesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche, but it&apos;s the perfect description for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays Antonius Block, a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by his cynical squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Jons is my favourite character in the movie, and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand&apos;s performance is even better. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part of Block&apos;s entourage, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and confess to developing quite a crush on Mia. I cannot recommend &apos;The Seventh Seal&apos; highly enough. Don&apos;t be put off by Bergman&apos;s highbrow reputation, this is a movie that can be appreciated by anybody, especially by old school horror fans. While it isn&apos;t strictly a horror movie itself anyone who admires the James Whale and Val Lewton classics of the 1930s and 1940s will find much to enjoy here."

The film is average routine and as such not made bad at all (certainly not within its genre), though the story  contains all the standard ingredients of the genre and is stale to say the least. The longing for the Heimat this time was thÃ t strong that the 10 years stay in the U.S.A. of one of the characters is finished off within 5 minutes!\n\n In short: the same boring viewing as usual, and only if you can accept that the real murderer of Klaus kept his mouth shut for 10 years for no reason other than not to cause a premature ending of the film, the story could be more or less acceptable. You might want to have the sound off whenever another folklore song is performed.",

      "reviewBody": "If you have seen the original version of this, then the chances are you will really want to see this. I have seen the original, so when i saw this first advertised, i almost wet myself with anticipation. Sadly, i have to report that I&apos;m quite disappointed. Paul Anderson does a pretty good job as Bex Bissle, however the performance can only be described as lacklustre when compared to the tower of menace and intensity that Gary Oldmans original incarnation produced.\n\nNow. If you are going to see this in the hope that its another Football Factory/Green Street/Rise Of The Footsoldier orgy of football and people bashing the crap out of each other, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\nThis film does however contain Elise tracksuits, Adidas trainers, some bad haircuts and a decent soundtrack. Oh and there is a lot of profanities if you like that sort of thing in a movie. thinking about it this movie doesn&apos;t have a great deal else. There isn&apos;t much talk about the beautiful game or the teams the firms themselves support, there isn&apos;t much in the way of beatings, and if I&apos;m honest, not a great deal of violence. Im actually very surprised that this merits an 18 certificate.\n\nHowever, the film is well acted, does feel quite indie and very British, though the trailer for that new Michael Caine movie was most likely the most excited i got in the whole 2 hours.\n\nYes see this movie if your interested in the subject matter, but if you haven&apos;t seen the original and want to watch a proper football hooligan movie, check that out instead.",

      "reviewBody": "This Italian action/adventure set during the Second World War is essentially a riff on the then recent American smash hit The Dirty Dozen (1967). Its story is broadly similar where we have a specially selected group of five American soldiers being chosen to go behind enemy lines to steal some heavily guarded battle plans from a well-protected German stronghold. But the question you need to ask yourself is could that earlier Hollywood blockbuster have been improved with the inclusion of scenes involving its crack commandos jumping off mini trampolines, using baseballs as weaponry and indulging in extended tap dancing routines? Well, this is the film that essentially answers that particular question. I&apos;m not going to give you the answer though as I think it&apos;s best a person decides for themselves on such matters.\n\nThis one features the go-to bad guy actor of the day, Klaus Kinski, in a role of a ruthless Nazi and the delectable Margaret Lee as a German double-agent. The five-man army, on the other hand, were decidedly less distinctive than this pair. The film itself is reasonably entertaining in a lots-of shooting kind of way but it is also very by-the-numbers too. The final assault on the German base drags somewhat until it becomes a machine gun fest. So I reckon it could have been a bit more interesting really but in fairness, like its title characters, it still gets the job done.",

Fellini&apos;s wild imagery makes narrative sense (well, sort of), when applied to the story of an addled English actor stumbling around Rome at breakneck speed. The segment also features a startlingly original image of evil (an &quot;Anglican devil,&quot; I think that&apos;s the Terence Stamp character&apos;s phrase). Maybe it&apos;s just me, but the segment&apos;s conception of the devil is among the spookiest things I&apos;ve ever seen on film; and when you get right down to it, it makes a lot more theological sense then ugly, scaly guys with tails.",

He did...and he did them damn well. Just look at the original version of the recently remade The Crazies. When &quot;Land...&quot; came out, I thought it was a rare miss. Then came &quot;Diary...&quot; and I thought it was weak, but I was still hopeful. Now with &quot;Survival...&quot; I&apos;m about ready to give up.\n\nThe story is pretty standard zombie stuff...a group of living folks just looking for a place to be zombie free. Fair enough. The problem is that it&apos;s just that...standard. Romero&apos;s earlier work, even when lacking in gore, was great because it was full of some subtle but still heavy social commentary. The only thing going on here is a second half plot line that turns into an Irish version of a Hatfield vs. McCoy situation. Sure, there&apos;s a lame last minute attempt to teach us a lesson that revenge doesn&apos;t get you anywhere, but it&apos;s too little too late. The film is certainly better than a lot of zombie films we&apos;ve been treated to as of late, but that&apos;s sure not saying much.\n\nTruth be told I was really excited to see another Romero flick (and not Cameron Romero). Now I&apos;m just kind of wishing the elder Romero would leave well enough alone and move onto something besides beating this dead horse.",

      "reviewBody": "Spending even a little bit of time with a Louis de FunÃ¨s film is proof enough of what a comedic genius he was; to the extent that there is variation in quality, it&apos;s by a matter of degrees (and personal preference) rather than whole numbers. With de FunÃ¨s having contributed to the writing in this instance in addition to starring the stage is readily set for a good time. Surprisingly, &apos;Le grand restaurant&apos; is actually more restrained and straightforward compared to other works in the man&apos;s oeuvre: de FunÃ¨s&apos; wild expressions and gesticulations are deemphasized, the length is very heavy with plot, and in general gags and comedy tend to be reserved for major sequences rather than proliferate throughout. In fact, though played for laughs and lighthearted fun, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s unreasonable to say that this is built more as an earnest thriller. Whatever the style, however, the unquestionable truth remains that this is superbly engaging and entertaining, and rather deserves much more broad recognition.\n\nExcise the sillier facets and the screenplay devised between de FunÃ¨s, Jean Halain, and filmmaker Jacques Besnard could very easily have been shaped into a serious spy flick, the story of an ordinary person who is unwittingly drawn into a game of international intrigue. The scene writing, stunts, and effects are ripe for adventurous excitement as much as for comedy, and Besnard&apos;s direction and Raymond Pierre Lemoigne&apos;s cinematography both seem geared more particularly toward those sincere thriller ends, not least at the climax where the very filming locations are also primed for it. Yet with every element being wonderfully exaggerated and/or cheekily twisted, especially the characterizations, dialogue, and acting, the result is glad amusement rather than pulse-pounding fixation. Naturally de FunÃ¨s stands out most as protagonist and beleaguered, demanding restauranteur Septime, but all his co-stars are just as splendid. And really, everything here is just as solid as one would assume of any contemporary fare - not just those stunts and effects, or the direction or cinematography, but also the sets, costume design, hair, makeup, and editing.\n\nProbably owing to the difference in tone, however slight, this maybe isn&apos;t as immediately grabbing or as completely engrossing as the more outwardly farcical features among de FunÃ¨s&apos; works. Be that as it may it&apos;s thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, handily achieving its simple goal of delighting audiences, and sometimes that&apos;s all a movie needs to be. One way or another this may not be an absolute must-see, but if you do have the opportunity to watch &apos;Le grand restaurant,&apos; I really don&apos;t think there&apos;s any going wrong here.",

The story lacks credibility, which spoils the fun a bit. In my view, the movie is still above average due to its abovementioned qualities and its director&apos;s creativity in putting the pieces of the (crime) puzzle together.\n\nA samurai comes to Hamburg, Germany, to find a bunch of rogues who have desecrated a shrine in Japan. The villains hire a ninja warrior to kill him. Don&apos;t be misled, this is not an action movie, and Chuck Norris is way out of sight. Director Blumenberg takes the time required to explain the characters and their motives, he skilfully puts Japan and Germany to good use for visual contrast, Japan becoming a symbol for the mysterious, the unknown, the incomprehensible. Great actors like Wojciech Pszoniak from Poland (you may remember him from `Danton&apos; or &quot;To Kill A Priest&quot;) save the day. Enjoyable!",

      "name": "Dramatic film about a wealthy New York Jew who is placed on trial accused of being an executer of grisly war crimes",
      "reviewBody": "Nice film with magnificent performances about a successful Jew who is kidnapped by Mosad to respond his crimes .It deals with a wealthy Jewish businessman is suspected of being a Nazi war criminal.\n\nThis is a retelling of a novel written by actor Robert Shaw, from whose credits he requested his name be removed, and it was adapted as a play by prestigious playwright Harold Pinter who also carried it to stage at a Broadway theater. It works up a certain weight in its exploration of interesting issues as wrong accusation, guilt, responsability and forgiveness .This one belongs to American Film Theater in which it tries to embalm theatrical interpretations. Being freely based on the life of Otto Adolf Eichmann, the picture depicts the arrest and subsequent trial of the former Nazi by the Israelies accused of being a former Nazi concentration commandant. The film&apos;s title is derived from the fact that Eichmann sat in glass booth during his trial. And his character has been also adapted in The trial of Adolf Eichman 1997, Eichmann 2007 by Robert Young with Thomas Kretschmann, Franca Potente, Stephen Fry and Hanna Arendt 2012 by Margarette Van Trotta with Barbara Sukowa, Julia Jentsch, Jane McTeer. Cast and support cast provide terrific acting, but it still emerges as stagily verbose. Starring Maximiliam Schell gives a fabulous performance, he delivers a self-indulgent playing, though overacting, at times. He is welll accompanied by a pretty support cast as Louis Nettleton as a prosecutor, Luther Adler as a Judge, Leonard Cimino as a witness, Henry Brown, Lawrence Pressman, among others.\n\nThe motion picture with adequate cinematography by Sam Leavitt, being professionally directed by Arthur Hiller. He was a good professional with long career and life, as he died at 93. Hiller directed all kinds of genres with penchant for dramas and comedies. Including important films with the greatest actors, such as : The Americanization of Emily, The miracle of the white stallions, Promise her anything, Plaza suite, Man of La Mancha, The in-laws, Making Love, Tobruk, Silver streak, Nightwing, Author author, Teachers, Outrageous fortune, The lonely guy, See no evil hear no evil, Taking care of business, The babe, among others .Rating 7/10 .Well worth watching. Better than average",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a lot to say here about the performances of Juliette Binoche and Denis Lavant. Lavant is always good in Carax&apos;s films; here he is simply outstanding. And seeing Binoche play a character with dimension, for once, is a pleasure. The real surprise is Klaus-Michael Gruber whose Hans is perhaps the most believable aspect of the film.\n\nBut what draws me to this film--tied for best of what I&apos;ve seen Carax do, along with &quot;Mauvais Sang&quot;--is the photography, sound and editing. Carax understands the use of image in narrative, and how to bring discordant scenes together to provide the sense of desperation needed to make this love story, so far removed from mainstream film romance, believable and engaging. From the opening soundtrack to the climactic scenes given over by his masterful use of jump cuts, Carax outdoes others, some long-established, who came late on the scene with these tools (Bertolucci; Soderbergh). What Carax started craft-wise with &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; he perfect in &quot;Les Amants du Pont Neuf.&quot;\n\nIf Lavant, Binoche and Gruber are not reason enough to rent this film, then Carax&apos;s pictorial ideas, carried through with his incredible sense of craft, should more than suffice. Sad that the film has suffered so quietly without major recognition, when, clearly, others have borrowed from it so willingly.",

      "reviewBody": "Generally speaking, I dislike the romantic American tearjerker dramas especially films like &apos;Titanic&apos;. So i tend to avoid them. A few that I have liked include &apos;Far and Away&apos; and &apos;The English Patient&apos; (which was much more than the average movie of this genre). What interested me about &apos;P.S. I Love You&apos; was the interesting ensemble cast. Now that I have watched the film, I must say that it came as a pleasant surprise.\n\nI found it very fresh: the cast which brings together talents like Lisa Kudrow, Kathy Bates and Hilary Swank; the idea of shooting in Ireland was very refreshing and the beautiful locations were so wonderfully shot that it just makes one want to visit the beautiful country; the screenplay, yes it is flawed as there are a few corny moments and some of the situations are a little too convenient but most of the dialogues are great, the comedic undertone is mostly welcoming and not misplaced, the ending is different from what one would expect; the soundtrack which adds more life into the moments.\n\nIt&apos;s ironic that just the other day I watched &apos;Reign Over Me&apos; which also dealt with &apos;grieving over&apos; lost loved ones. Both films were totally different but it was interesting to see how the central character of both films deal, or more correctly, fail to cope with their losses in different ways. Both the writer and director LaGravenese put a lot of heart into &apos;P.S. I Love You&apos; and the film is strengthened by the chemistry of the actors.\n\nBoth Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. The chemistry between them is electric. Swank gracefully shows Holly&apos;s transition from the whiny but loving working wife to the lonely widow. In a flashback scenes we see her brilliantly pull off the naive teenager. It&apos;s no surprise that the woman can act. Butler is terrific as the charming, lively and funny Gerry but his grasp of the Irish accent is disastrous. Lisa Kudrow provides comic relief. The actress gives a natural performance with shades of her famous Phoebe Buffay character (which I didn&apos;t mind as I miss Phoebe) but I wish she was given more screen time. Even Gina Gershon springs a surprise with a decent performance. Kathy Bates&apos;s acting is beautifully restrained. Harry Connick Jr. too adds some comedy (which might not appeal to all).\n\n&apos;P.S. I Love You&apos; makes for a good rainy day film. It might not appeal to all as there are a few fluffy corny moments but the film does make its point well and for me it was worth a watch."

I didn&apos;t detect any pretension that the film-makers thought it was anything more than it was: a thoroughly enjoyable piece of fluff with a couple of very attractive stars. I was surprised on one or two occasions when Muniz appeared to be doing some stunts that didn&apos;t involve wire work to see that this boy has action man potential.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that will have the young set whooping with delight. That hottie Angie Harmon also provides interest for older male viewers.",

      "reviewBody": "The proper translation of this movie title would be &quot;Reserved for Death&quot;. This is a neat little cloak-and-dagger spy story shot in glorious black and white and released in 1963 at the height of the Cold War. What makes this movie different is that it was produced in East Germany! Here is the basic set up: Erich Becker (played by Hans-Peter Minetti) is a former East German national living in Stockholm, Sweden. He flies to Frankfurt in West Germany to meet someone about a job. We learn that Erich will have to take a night train to Erfuhrt, East Germany and meet a certain Dr. Jadenburg (played by Martin FlÃ¶rchinger) and then bring him back to West Germany. Erich is given false papers with an assumed name so the East German authorities will not know. Clearly, this job is spy mission on behalf of the West German government!\n\nOnce Erich is on the train, he meets a young woman named Hanna (played by Irma MÃ¼nch) who knows about the plan. She then reveals other details that give Erich doubts about continuing. A reluctant spy, he considers getting off the train before it enters East Germany. But the last stop before crossing the border is quickly approaching! Are any other spies involved? Who can Erich really trust? And are the East Germans already aware of this mission and setting up a trap? On the face of it, this looks like a classic 1960&apos;s spy movie of the &quot;Smiley&quot; variety. Some might consider it a propaganda film, but this viewer disagrees. The depiction of West Germany (using stock footage and their own props) seems fair and accurate. At the border, both the western and eastern customs officials were presented as polite and efficient (properly German, in other words.) With that said, the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; are definitely those people who sent Erich Becker into East Germany on a dangerous mission.\n\nIt is important to know that at the time this movie was made, the Berlin Wall had just been erected. The official position of the East German government was that the border was sealed to protect their own citizens against Fascism and Aggression, primarily coming from the United States. West Germany might have more luxuries, but its politics were bankrupt. Yes, some people might be lured away from East Germany by promises of money, but it came at a moral cost. Any film made in East Germany that did not agree with this view would simply not be released. And any foreign films that depicted East Germany in a negative way would never be shown there. Censorship in East Germany was a constant way of life...\n\nOf some interest here is that the two primary actors in this movie, Hans-Peter Minetti and Irma MÃ¼nch, were married in real life and had a son, Daniel. Born in 1958, Daniel Minetti is also an actor who is currently working. Hans-Peter enjoyed a long productive career in East Germany until 1990, at which point the regime collapsed. Thereafter, he received a lot of criticism for his strong support of East Germany. No more major roles for him!",

It just rips your heart out, and makes you think long after the movie is over.  It is about isolation, alienation, lost causes, and the inevitable future.  In short, it is a genuine science fiction film, not a gunfight covered with techno-glitz and special effects calling itself science fiction.  Star Wars is great science fantasy, but the essence of science fiction is about what could happen, and is happening, and by the end of the film we have the disturbing feeling that it is a prediction of the future that will happen without intervention.\n\nThe feelings of sadness and hope this film evokes are inextricably linked in this film, right up until the end.  If you rent this movie, you will be haunted by its images long after you have forgotten other films. \n\n Ten out of ten stars; from the writing, directing and acting, right down to the three robot drones (Huey, Dewey and Louie), there is nothing to fault with in this film."

Robert Vaughn plays Bergen&apos;s husband. The setting is a mental institution where Polly Bergen is brought after she goes insane at a theater showing West Side Story. She wasn&apos;t the first. The focus is on her case as the director of nurses (Crawford) and the doctor in charge of an experimental program (Stack) duke it out - naturally Crawford favors things like discipline and confinement (she would) and Stack wants to treat the patients as people and give them therapy. I don&apos;t know where the drugs were, unless they didn&apos;t have them in 1963. I&apos;m pretty sure they had Librium, though Polly didn&apos;t seem to be on it.\n\nThis film has TV written all over it, including in its choice of the actors, most of whom did major work on television. It&apos;s not strong enough for a feature film, though it looks for all intents and purposes like a B movie which it perhaps was. Robert Stack is pretty one-note. Crawford in 1963 still looked good in a leotard but the rest of her is plenty scary. I&apos;m not sure the portrayal of the conflict was correct in its dynamics - nurses have a certain amount of power but riding roughshod over a doctor&apos;s orders...I suppose with Crawford heading up the staff, it&apos;s more than possible but not realistic.\n\nJanis Paige gives a lively performance as a man-hater, and there is the ubiquitous non-speaker (Barrie), the nice one (Corby), the delusional one (Hugueny), and the one who will probably recover (Bergen). Herbert Marshall plays the head of the institute - by 1963, he was 73 and had enjoyed 50 years on stage and in films. After a distinguished career, &quot;The Caretakers&quot; is thankfully not his last credit. Constance Ford played a nurse from hell who is not a credit to her profession. There were two hunks with the last name of Williams back in the day - Van and Grant - this one&apos;s Van. Nice eye candy but he didn&apos;t have much to do.\n\nAll in all, pretty badly directed and executed.",

This makes the aircraft look strange and unreal. It ruins the experience.\n\nThis should have been a &quot;must see&quot; movie for aviation buffs since it shows an important period in the development of aviation. But stretching the film to fit a widescreen format makes the scenes of the X-15, the B-52 mother-ship and the F-104 and F-100 chase planes look distorted and unrealistic. It is a real waste and a shame that the film producers were more concerned with using a widescreen than with a usable presentation.",

      "reviewBody": "This is another stage-bound sort of effort from UFA starring Lilian Harvey and Willi Fritsch--with a dash of Heinz Ruehmann thrown in. The end result is actually enjoyable, even if the plot is hackneyed and predictable.\n\nThe story concerns a young woman who regrets being married to a much older man who makes toys. The toymaker suffers his wife&apos;s more suitable suitors, but it looks like the most ardent one of these might actually be a thief looking to rob both the toymaker and his young wife of their valuables.\n\nThe farce is played well and the chemistry between Fritsch and Harvey is, as usual, great. Lilian Harvey looks particularly good in this film in very chic deco-esque costumes. From the historical viewpoint, it&apos;s fun to see Harvey driving on the Champs Elysee in Paris in some location shots. Additionally, she and Fritsch are given some good pop songs like &quot;Let Me Be Your Carmen&quot;, &quot;I&apos;ll Go Fiji&quot; and &quot; An Affair On the Side Isn&apos;t For You&quot;. The end takes place in a wild sort of hedonistic nightclub that adds to the curio aspects of this film.\n\nRuehmann is funny as one of Harvey&apos;s hopeful admirers--and the ill-fated Kurt Gerron has a small role as a policeman."

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know how to begin to &quot;review&quot; this cinematic experience, as I felt immersed in the film rather than trying to get my mind around it entirely. This work is neither an apologia for Hitler and the Third Reich nor a condemnation, but a serious attempt by a true intellectual and film auteur, Syberberg, to look at it ALL from every side, the horror and evil as well as the cultural, historical, and philosophical foundations of Hitler and the German people.\n\nThe film is subtitled &quot;A Film From Germany&quot; because it is plumbs not only the depths of Nazism and World War II but the entire German psyche. It attempts to present, through hard facts, historical documents, films and photographs, and also through dream, metaphor, and stunningly haunting tableaux, what Hitler really MEANT and what he continues to mean. There are many excellent actors portraying both well-known figures like Himmler and lesser known individuals like Hitler&apos;s valet who relate what might seem like endless minutiae of Hitler&apos;s daily life but do add a great deal to the ultimate picture of the man about whom so much has been written. It seems that if you don&apos;t revile him completely, even today, you are suspected of being a neo-fascist yourself, but this film attempts to offer a complete picture and by extension, a baring of the German soul and what is referred to on several occasions as their &quot;happy guilt&quot;.\n\nOne issue I have is with the English subtitles. There are so many typographical and spelling errors that one could only call it sloppy. I don&apos;t know why a film of this magnitude that took so long coming to home video shouldn&apos;t have had more scrupulous editing. Considering how many talking heads there are in the film and the volume of exposition, it was hard enough to keep up with the subtitles without stumbling over the mistakes. On the plus side, there is a lot of English voice-over that provides some breathing space for us Anglos.\n\nAnd one last comment on the historical context. Considering the film was made in 1977, 34 years ago, much has changed in the world, in Europe, and in the global culture, that the film presciently hints at, not the least of which is the continued emergence of Germany and Japan both economically and democratically. One important point &quot;Our Hitler&quot; made was that Hitler was probably the apotheosis of democracy, rising as he did from the middle class and glorifying the common people, and being democratically elected by them. What he did with that mandate was probably the most horrifying and endlessly fascinating stories of the 20th century.",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of the book I had a mixed reaction to this adequate yet overall uninspiring adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s brilliant novel. \n\nLooking back at my viewing experience I was reminded of the early adaptation of &apos;Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin&apos; from the earliest era of films, in which the filmmakers expected you to have read the book and simply showed you interpretations of various scenes. \n\nAlex Garland&apos;s screenplay boasted the ambition of including a little bit of everything from Ishiguro&apos;s 300 page book in his slightly under two hour movie. The result is a simple abridgment, we have time to realize the love brewing between the characters, the strained friendship between Mulligan&apos;s Kathy and Knightley&apos;s Ruth, and the dilemma of their caregivers at Hailsham. But the film lacks much the catharsis and the commentary that made the book so great.\n\nRomanek has proved himself to be a capable director, but here he made some negative decisions which really removed much of the impact of the plot. Adam Kimmel&apos;s cinematography is a stand out here, and given the competition so far I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he receives an Oscar nomination for his work. \n\nThe calm collection and stoic nature of much of the acting can be seen as insipid or uninteresting to some. But I found the acting to be quite appropriate, the tight lipped, proper British style of this movie provided an nice contrast and balance to a story which could have turned into a mindless melodramatic tear jerker if not handled correctly.\n\nIn the end, I think active viewer-ship is of paramount importance to this movie. The film is never interested in simply handing the audience its ideas. Rather it called upon us to dig for meaning. I would say the plot itself served as a bit of a metaphor, and that intrigued me. And, despite some of the negative artistic liberties which were taken in this adaptation, I feel that it did well enough to create an involving, though provoking, and sometimes heartbreaking experience.\n\nDespite its flaws, &apos;Never Let Me Go&apos; has been one of the few strong film that we&apos;ve had this year. And, if your one of those people who goes to the movies once or twice a month, I&apos;d say &apos;Never Let Me Go&apos; is one of your better bets for an agreeable experience at the movies right now.",

Still worshipped by legions of fans, lauded by trendy music critics and name-dropped by lots of recent bands, Morrissey remains a controversial and rather strange character. He proved in this documentary that he is still as funny and as acerbic as ever, although the music certainly isn&apos;t as fresh, vibrant or interesting as it was in the Smiths. The problem with the documentary, though, is that it demonstrated quite clearly that he still tends to stand against much more than he stands for. His devotion to vegetarianism has remained consistent, but his status as a political artist has no substance. He criticises Tony Blair and the Royals, just as he criticised Mrs Thatcher and the Royals back in his prime, but he offers no constructive, viable political views. He just criticises for the sake of it while living in opulence. He now represents the kind of wealth, luxury and smugness that his fans detested about his &apos;80s pop contemporaries.\n\nA funny, entertaining figure? Certainly. But a credible spokesman on the world&apos;s problems who should be taken as seriously as he obviously is by many? This documentary did nothing to quell my doubts about that.",

The story is very slight and it takes awhile to get going, but for ninety minutes I was interested in these people, especially Taylor.  The scene where she orders dinner for herself in an upscale restaurant is very funny. The whole thing makes me miss River very much also."

They meet up again and Harvey offers him an underground fight. Martinez (Luis GuzmÃ¡n) is another promoter. Zulay Velez is the single mom waitress love interest. Evan Hailey is a rival fighter who was on the same college wrestling team coached by Shawn&apos;s father.\n\nThis has a feel of something more interesting than a B-movie. Terrence Howard does that to his films. He makes it better than it should be. This is most notable for an early starting role for Tatum. He has solidified this character type with a chip on his shoulder. The fight scenes tries to be indie gritty. Other than that, this movie doesn&apos;t stand out.",

      "reviewBody": "Although the split-screen technique had been around for a decade or so, it was usually more noted for its failures than its success, and the actor required to play dual roles usually took tremendous heat for their failure to create two physically identical but distinctly different characterizations on screen. But with THE PARENT TRAP, with the difficult dual role resting on the shoulders of an extremely young star, Walt Disney struck gold. It would be the single highest grossing film the studio had released up to that time, and even some forty years later the baby-boomers who flocked to see it in 1961 regard it as one of their favorite movie experiences.\n\nBut THE PARENT TRAP has a lot more going for it than mere nostalgia. The cast is really, really good, featuring the ever-likable Maureen O&apos;Hara and Brian Keith in leading roles and a host of great character actors (including Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp) in minor roles. And then there is Haley Mills. The daughter and sister of noted English actors, Mills was no newcomer to the screen when THE PARENT TRAP went before the cameras--she had even picked up an Oscar for her earlier Disney film POLLYANNA. Even so, this was no guarantee that she could pull off the feat of double roles, something that had daunted even the legendary Bette Davis. But she did.\n\nThe story has been told so often that surely every one knows it by now. A wife delivers twin daughters--but shortly afterward divorces her husband, and each wins custody of one child. The children are raised without any knowledge of each other&apos;s existence... until they unexpectedly bump into each other at summer camp, put two and two together, and devise a scheme to get their parents back together again.\n\nEven today, and in spite of its familiarity, it&apos;s an amusing idea, and while the actual script is weak in spots the cast, and especially Haley Mills, makes the most of it. There&apos;s plenty of slapstick, lots of laugh-out-loud scenes, and enough charm to beguile all but the most cynical viewers. And Haley Mills clearly demonstrates why she was regarded as the single most gifted child actor of her era: although she plays both Susan and Sharon with the same edge of mischievous fun, they do indeed come off as completely different personalities.\n\nOf course, digital technology has left the old split-screen technique in the dust, and today its easy to see the flaws in the technique that weren&apos;t so obvious at the time. And the quality of the film transfer is not the best: while this isn&apos;t the worst transfer I&apos;ve seen, it is full of artifacts nonetheless. Even so, the appeal of the story, the cast, and most particularly Haley Mills make up for a lot, and this Disney double DVD comes complete with a host of bonuses (including a making-of documentary and an audio commentary track by director David Swift and Haley Mills) that fans will enjoy quite a bit.\n\nIf you were a fan of the film then, you&apos;ll remain a fan of it now. And if you want to introduce your family to a truly charming movie experience, you couldn&apos;t make a better choice.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

When the police try to arrest Pepe in the Casbah, he quickly disappears and they receive no cooperation from the locals.  To lure him out of that district&apos;s confines, the cops set up a trap using the unknowing Lamarr as bait.  their sad, brief romance ends, presumably, with his incarceration.

Alec Baldwin, stock rising after 30 Rock, was not the right choice for this &apos;story&apos;, and between them they cannot save a weak script or inject anything of interest. They are not convincing of love, nor even interact in any interesting way. Nor are there any compensatory laughs. The plot is a straight forward slice-of-life of a girl who meets an older man, and shacks up with him. What happens in the end? Nothing to care about.",

Quite frankly, I like the animals story more than the humans story. This is inspired by the song and the two men who created it in 1818. The song is performed at the end. I hoped to have the two mice actually perform for the Queen. It&apos;s the starting premise of the movie and I feel cheated that the mice didn&apos;t sing the song.

Helmer Steve Carver mixes a realistic approach with comic strip elements effectively and though results are routine. Pic should please fans of chop-socky.\n\nNorris toplines as a San Francisco cop who quits the force and goes after revenge when his partner and partner&apos;s girlfriend are killed by drug traffickers. Aided by his former police boss Capt. Stevens (Richard Roundtree), Norris evens the accounts and takes care of the drug ring.\n\nMaking solid atmospheric use of S. F. locations, Carver segues from realistic violence and tension to comic strip hokum in the form of a huge oriental villain (Toru Tanaka), whose menacing antics tip the audience that the film is all in fun. Format has Norris, in traditional Western genre fashion, helped and heckled by an old pro &quot;master&quot; James Chan (Mako), whose wisecracks provide comic relief.\n\nNorris&apos;s acting is improving and his balletic fighting and kicking skills remain tops in the field. Chris Lee is fine as an urbane villain, while Maggie Cooper is cute as romantic interest for Norris. Tech credits are good, My review was written in August 1981 after a Midtown Manhattan screening."

      "reviewBody": "This is a fantastic film from Dziga Vertov. It is quite personal and yet shows the intense and varied activities of numerous people in the Soviet Union of 1924. It is as artistic and creative as anything being done in the United States or Germany at the time. It was cutting edge cinematic constructivism.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this film with Vertov&apos;s &quot;Three Songs of Lenin&quot; ten years later. While &quot;Kinoeye&quot; is interested in showing the truth about life and the world, &quot;Three Songs&quot; is only interested in dogmatic praise of Lenin. The two films show the difference between the Soviet Union of Lenin and the Soviet Union of Joseph Stalin. This film shows people drinking, smoking, taking cocaine, and joking. We see disfigured people in an insane asylum, we see a homeless boy sleeping in the streets and a man who died in the streets. In contrast to this, in &quot;Three Songs,&quot; everybody is heroic and everybody is marching forward, there are more machines than people, and the film suggests that Lenin magically solved all the problems of the past. One can argue that the Soviet Union was facing the threat of Nazi Germany in 1934 and therefore needed heroic militaristic films to inspire their people. The same images of poverty and people just surviving day to day, that we get in &quot;Kinoeye&quot; would not have inspired people faced with the threat of Nazi insanity.\n\nThese things are hard to judge, but when socialist realism turned into socialist heroism and only showed the good and strong instead of showing everything, I think it took a big step away from the truth. I should like to think that Lenin would have loved &quot;Kinoeye&quot; and hated &quot;Three Songs of Lenin&quot;. After all, he never flinched from looking upon and seeing the darker sides of reality.",

      "reviewBody": "A sanitized account of the personal lives and professional partnership of Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart.  Tom Drake is his usual bland self as Rogers and Mickey Rooney is characteristically over-the-top as the self-destructive, troubled Hart.  (According to the film, Hart&apos;s problems stemmed from a failed romance with a singer, played here by Betty Garrett. In truth, Hart was gay but this was only part of what contributed to his complicated personality.)  The film is notable only for its many musical numbers.  Among the highlights: Lena Horne&apos;s masterful rendition of &quot;Where or When&quot; and &quot;The Lady is a Tramp&quot;; June Allyson and the Blackburn Twins&apos; charming &quot;Thou Swell&quot;; and Judy Garland and Rooney&apos;s spirited &quot;I Wish I Were In Love Again&quot; as well as Garland&apos;s dynamic &quot;Johnny One Note&quot;.  The show-stopper, however, is the brilliant jazz ballet, &quot;Slaughter On Tenth Avenue&quot;, choreographed by Gene Kelly and danced expertly by Kelly and the fabulous Vera-Ellen.  It, alone, is worth the price of admission."

      "reviewBody": "Since, I was three years old I have loved Herbie, the Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of his own. The Love Bug is a wonderful film for the family. Filled with adventure, comedy, and sweetness it is perfect for kids of all ages. When Jim Douglas, played by Dean Jones, starts to have a fluke in his racing career he almost gives up hope. He is stunned by a car dealership that is owned by Thorndyke, played by David Tomlinson, where he first runs into the famous Herbie. After standing up for the little car, Jim has found that the little car is his for keeps.\n\nAfter winning numerous races, Jim believes it is his luck and not the little car. Tennessee, played by Buddy Hackett, knows that it is the little car and not Jim. Tennessee also influences Carole, played by Michele Lee, who took a little more convincing. Thorndyke tries many evil and cruel stunts to win Herbie back. After a mere loss, Jim has to prove himself to the little car and to the rest of his friends.\n\nA big race is where Jim believes he will do it. The race is two days long and in those two days the little car will be tested to the limits. Herbie rides on water, rides with only two wheels, and even comes apart. Thorndyke is a true bad loser and is actually intimidated by the little car. This will determine who the better person in the end is.\n\nThe actors in this movie are truly acting and the content of the movie is\n\ngood as well. Robert Stevenson did a wonderful job directing this movie. Having the actors know how to act and having the little car doing all of the stunts played a really made a difference in this movie. As for the little car, I would like to know how they made him come to life so well that kept my interest for fifteen years. This is a wonderful movie and families every where will fall in love with Herbie and the rest of the cast."

Their acting was seconded by the experienced and charismatic Marcello Mastroianni in the role of a typical Italian tricky pigeon and lover. Italy of the 50s had the problem of prostitution, and mafia was around it together with some &quot;gentlemen&quot; of the corrupted local administration always looking for licenses, permits and other documents in a tricky way to facilitate the work of the prostitutes who at the same time had to pay heavy sum of money to the above-mentioned gentlemen. The director Antonio Pietrangeli was able to show clearly where the problem was and who were promoting the dirty business of prostitution. In addition, youth does not last forever and the same happened with the beauty of the prostitutes. The film also shows this fact convincingly. The DVD of this film exists but only in Italian, and it would be good to have it in other languages (English, Spanish and French at least).",

      "reviewBody": "This story of a 17-year old poet, vegan and above all loner has its share of faults. The major fault is the script. Tove Edfeldt is in all the scenes and she is not a capable actress enough to carry the movie herself. Her character Hannah is a goody two shoes who loves leaving her poetry in corner shops, won&apos;t get a driver&apos;s license and who prefers vegan coffee drinks and I can&apos;t help feel a bit nauseated by this self appointed world savior.\n\nPerhaps the director Olofson are trying to say something profound about TV reality shows and their impact but the whole idea is simply far fetched. And although Tove Edfeldt has a lot of acting experience her lines are platitudes. She is talented and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future, with a script that will do her justice.\n\nApart from this, the supporting cast are mostly unknown to me and I get a feeling of amateur night, e.g. Hannah&apos;s two friends at school. But I noticed Mathias Rust replaying his role from Show Me Love (1998) as a guy showing off his cellphone.",

I can&apos;t stress enough, however, that Michael Biehn&apos;s performance as Coffi is the best performance out of the many films of this nature released that year.\n\nLORDS OF THE DEEP is no exception despite the hindrances of its low production value. Unlike the other fairly rushed efforts it deals with peaceful aliens, much like THE ABYSS, and the problems come from its villain, played very well by Bradford Dillman. It deals with environmental issues and doesn&apos;t do it with the same nasty insubordinate tone of James Cameron&apos;s disgustingly evil ideas in the propaganda that is THE ABYSS.\n\nThe aliens themselves are a treat when you see them and they&apos;re quite cool to look at.\n\nThe plot itself, especially the actions of Dillman&apos;s villain, is absolutely serviceable, as is the music.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t rate it as good as LEVIATHAN, DEEPSTAR SIX, or even THE RIFT, because it doesn&apos;t have much re-watchability, owing to the lack of special effects, but it&apos;s fine for chilling out to.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a fan of 80&apos;s movies and The Heavenly Kid was a nice yet charming story filled with emotion, drama and just the right touch of romance added to it. The story is about a a teenage rebel who died in a car accident in the late 60&apos;s and is sent down to earth in the 80&apos;s on a mission to help a nerdy young man and gain his entrance into heaven.\n\nLewis Smith was perfect as Bobby Fantana he played the part of a rebellious greaser very well. During the film his character discovers quite a few surprises along the way and learns the importance of sacrifice and getting a second chance. Jane Kaczmarek in her days before Malcolm In The Middle was well casted as Bobby&apos;s former girlfriend Emily and the mother of the young lad he was sent to help.\n\nIn the 1960&apos;s Bobby Fantana (Smith) is a rebellious, greaser with attitude who challenges Joe Barnes(Metcalf) to a game of chicken after he made a pass at his girlfriend Emily. Bobby wins the race but unfortunately isn&apos;t able to get out of the car in time and dies in an explosion. 17 to 18 years later he&apos;s given an assignment and that is to help an awkward kid become more confident aiding him in the job is his guide Rafferty (Mulligan). Once on earth he meets his project who turns out to be geeky Lenny Barnes (Gedrick) a teen in love with a popular girl named Sharon. Soon enough Bobby begins working his magic and the once shy young man becomes more confident and cool.However with this newfound coolness Lenny becomes cockier and defiant towards friends and family. During the course of the story Bobby discovers that Lenny&apos;s mom is his former girlfriend and that she&apos;s married to Joe his old rival.\n\nThere is a scene where he makes himself visible to Emily and they spend a nice night out reminiscing and then she drops the biggest bombshell of all Bobby is Lenny&apos;s father. Trouble soon arises when Rafferty informs him that Lenny is going to die in the same manner as he did, it&apos;s then that Bobby learns about the true meaning of love and sacrifice when he decides to give up his soul in order to prevent his son&apos;s death.\n\nFilled with nice music and a good ending The Heavenly Kid is a pleasant surprise for anyone who deserves another chance at life.",

That&apos;s right, two Tom Brady&apos;s. Well, the clone Tom Brady is the bad Tom Brady. He threw a lot of interceptions, when the script called for a touchdown. Tre&apos;davious White threw down the interception, like had had caught a poisonous snake. Then he fell down like he broke his leg. That man is a team player! But the bad Tom Brady wasn&apos;t done being bad. He cloned himself! This clone was a GOOD Tom Brady. But now there are THREE Tom Bradys! To me, one Tom Brady is more than enough.

      "reviewBody": "Heavens be thanked for how Australians and New Zealanders have revived the acting element of film. \n\nEverything in the country seems set up to produce performing artists, even talented writers that understand acting, where Brazil produces soccer players and the US lawyers.\n\nHere you have three of our actresses in essentially their first roles. Thandie Newton already at the peak of her screen charm, and Nicole Kidman and buddy Naomi Watts. Set in Australia, written and directed by an Australian, using what I have come to think of as the simple end of an Australian character spectrum.\n\nThis is a simple &quot;coming of age&quot; story. So simple, you begin with some trepidation. How many of these does one have to slog through to find something new? Well, there&apos;s nothing new here, but it turns adult rather quickly toward the end and allows us to leave it without feeling cheap.\n\nAnd isn&apos;t that part of the skill of these things, to allow us to visit the insecurities of youth (which we probably still have) and to do so safely and finally to recall the experience fondly (so we will tell our friends to see this movie).\n\nNicole and Naomi aren&apos;t any reason to see this. They&apos;re simply standard props and rather far from the skills they&apos;d develop. No, it is just the simple arc of the thing. No particular folding (as in &quot;Sirens&quot;), no cheap titillation, just honest, innocent yearning in a hostile world. Hostile large and small.\n\nConcerning the titillation, a key plot device revolves around our hero interceding to prevent a compromising photo from being taken. So, a negative fold, if you will, a deliberate statement of flatness. This is accentuated by frequent references to booknames that would be familiar to youngsters as &quot;adult&quot; (Sartre, Camus, Marx) and Sartre&apos;s appearance at the boxing match where our hero gets pummeled. \n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

It&apos;s not hard to guess who&apos;s the villain, in addition to a man-eating bear who stalks the two of them after their plane crashes in the woods of Alaska.\n\nThe sophistication of Hopkins, playing an extremely smart man, battling the crude Baldwin, who is insanely jealous of Hopkins&apos; possessions, including his gorgeous wife (Elle McPherson), is intriguing to watch. So is the great scenery and best-of-all, a great action story that has you focused intently for the full two hours.\n\nA human characteristic so often ignored in films the past half century is put on display here: compassionate forgiveness. Seeing forgiveness demonstrated instead of revenge is almost shocking to see. Kudos to the filmmakers, too, for not going overboard on the brutality in this adventure.",

There are more funny lines and good gags than you can count, even when you&apos;ve already seen it a few times.\n\nCary Grant is excellent at this kind of manic comedy, and Rosalind Russell gives what had to be one of her very best performances, as a worthy foil for Grant&apos;s domineering character.  Ralph Bellamy is also ideal as the naive insurance salesman, and they are backed up by a cast filled with fine comic character actors.  Some of the supporting cast do a terrific job of getting laughs with very limited screen time.  They all get great material to work with, too.  The dialogue is just amazing, with funny, creative lines coming constantly - sometimes literally on top of each other.  The setting and the plot create hilarious situations and some great opportunities to satirize politicians and the news media.  If anything, the satire is even funnier and more appropriate as regards today&apos;s institutions than it was in 1940.\n\n&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is absolutely hilarious, a classic comedy that you can watch and enjoy over and over."

      "reviewBody": "Hong Sang-soo: Tale of Cinema/keuk jang jeon (South Korea/France/MK2 2005). 90 minutes. No US distributer. Shown at the New York Film Festival, Lincoln Center, October 1 and 2, 2005.\n\nHong was back for the third time at the New York Film Festival with this appealing self-reflexive look at ineffectual young men who happen to be filmmakers. The first segment is a film about such a man (Lee Kiwoo), who is tall and handsome but directionless. He meets an old girlfriend (Uhm Jiwon) and eventually talks her into committing suicide with him, though the attempt ends comically.\n\nTen years later, the star, who was also the director, is now famous and ill. His co-star, the girl, is a successful actress. She encounters a classmate of the filmmaker, also handsome, now down on his luck, who claims his story was appropriated in the film, and it seems like it is going to repeat itself as he gloms onto her and they spend a drunken night together.\n\nWhat&apos;s interesting is the way Hong slides from glamorous ennui to comical mediocrity in his meandering New Wave-ish sequences in a brightly lit but tacky urban Korea. Is Seoul really anything like Paris? Perhaps not. But Hong&apos;s sweetly melancholy film with its gentle convolutions lingers pleasantly in the mind -- despite the slightly too-easy irony of its finale with the once &quot;suicidal&quot; director now whimpering that he doesn&apos;t want to die.\n\nHong was born in Korea but got a BFA at California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and an MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago.",

As with any with movie with a historical basis, I was a nervous that Bollywood would use artistic license to cheapen the story. In fact, the director, Santoshi shows in details how Bhagat came to develop his views of the British with very little outside distraction.\n\nAjay Devgan is excellent as a the title character, bringing the necessary passion that only he can provide with his steel-y stare. Of particular note is the scene showing the freedom fighters telling Gandhi to stop working within the British framework. Westerners can see the parallel between Gandhi&apos;s nonviolent methods and the more revolutionary Bhagat Singh with Martin Luther King&apos;s methods vs Malcolm X &quot;by any means necessary&quot; credo.\n\nAs the last reviewer mentioned, it&apos;s a great reference for those interested in India&apos;s independence struggle and it truly reinvigorated my interest in Indian history.\n\nSee this movie if you enjoy eastern history, but won&apos;t go for the traditional Bollywood flick."

      "reviewBody": "This superb drama offers middle-aged longing, lost dreams, success, despair, and superb acting by Jack Lemmon (won the Oscar) and Jack Gilford (nominated for supporting). BUT: this film is not for everybody. A serious drama about middle-aged loss, struggle, and fading dreams won&apos;t grab every one. It&apos;s too slow for some viewers, and too realistic for some others. \n\nHarry Stoner (Lemmon) is as an LA businessman who seeks an arsonist to burn him out so he can collect the insurance and rebuild his failing business. His aging partner Phil Greene (Jack Gilford) opposes this, but realizes at his age (close to 65) he may never find another job. Both men are decent but jaded, and troubled by the lost innocence (or false innocence) of their youth in Brooklyn. Harry is also troubled by post-traumatic stress flashbacks from his lost comrades at Anzio in World War II, while Phil is troubled by going along with a crime that means losing his integrity. Both men appear to be Jewish, and may feel added burdens that come with having beaten anti-Semitic discrimination (or worse). There is the also longing for their boyhood in New York, before crime made cities less safe, and before the Dodgers (plus these two men) deserted Brooklyn for Los Angeles - which is not quite the sunny paradise that both probably hoped for. This film also came out in 1973, as Watergate, Vietnam, and the non-success of the Great Society all seemed to evidence a certain national decline. \n\nSave the Tiger is like &quot;Death of Salesman Goes To LA.&quot; There is fantasy, failure, and searing struggles for success. The two main characters are not so tragic as Willie Loman; yet they are not all that far removed, either."

Yes, you can leave your kids alone watching it. If your leg is broken you can watch it with them (I see no other good reason but being unable to move with remote broken). The trouble is that in this sequel teenagers seem to be more highlighted, so it may be less interesting for youngsters. But you&apos;ll need armed guards to keep 21st-century-teenagers watch till the end of this movie.\n\nSo who is the target audience? I have no idea. Uncles maybe.

Another mistake then shifts him from actor to private detective, and this is where Val Kilmer comes in and things start to go wrong, more wrong and unbelievably wrong until they&apos;ve snowballed into an enjoyable detective mess -- all to impress failed actress Harmony (Next big thing: Michelle Monaghan).\n\nShane Black&apos;s directorial debut &apos;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&apos; is a comic film noir. Even in the dazzling opening credits using a montage of contrasts of red, black and white, it is evident that this is no run-of-the-mill crime story, but a viciously entertaining ride from scene 01. What makes it so special is that it mixes equal doses of humour and crime like a $15,000,000 blender, pouring out a balanced end product and glazing it with a clever narrative coating by Robert Downey Jr. Black also sprinkles some rapid-fire dialogue onto his product, which is facilitated by the comedic chemistry between Downey and Kilmer. Some of the lines, gags and images are truly laugh-out-loud worthy. Everything else is nice, but forgettable.\n\nIts only problem, as far as I can see it, is its paper-thin plot. It does not seem believable; it is complex, dizzying and not nearly as involving as it would like to be. So back to formula on that one, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang would be a near-perfect comedy-thriller.\n\n7.5/10",

They enlist the daughter of the landlord who&apos;s not the usual sex symbol or ethereal beauty that permeate these movies for help running the place. Her name is Polly (Elfi Eschke) and she has a massive crush on bad boy Bobby who actually seems interested in her too which is unusual for him. I&apos;ll just now mention that this seems like a Cinderalla tale but there&apos;s some twists that one may or not be able to predict if one is familiar with certain movies. This time, while there&apos;s some nudity, there are no sex scenes despite the presence of some of the women from previous entries. Oh, and I should also mention that I couldn&apos;t find an English-dubbed version so I settled for the German language one so despite that I noticed some visual gags, some of which were funny. Star Noy thought up the story and so it&apos;s mainly about him. Also, this film seemed more dramatic than usual for the series. With all that, I quite enjoyed Summertime Blues.

      "reviewBody": "Every once in a while, a true gem pops up unexpectedly.  This story based on a legend from the Lapps, or Saami, is just such a case in point.  Everything in it works.  The elements of folklore and the mythic journey come together in an amazing tale of a young man&apos;s journey to manhood and redemption.  The most amazing thing about this film, however, is its realization in the cultural context from which it belongs.  This is a Saami legend, told in the Saami language and Saami actors giving us a deep drink of their rich culture.  The scenery is breathtaking in its stark, snow-white beauty.  The tale is brutal but life in the circumpolar region we knew as Lappland was often brutal and unforgiving.  This is a hearty tale of a hardy people and while it focuses on the journey and heroic adventure of a young man, it is also very much a tale of the Saami people, many of whom still follow their reindeer herds across that barren, frozen landscape today.  The film is wonderful in its simplicity and honesty.  There are no high dramatic moments, no cars flying across the screen, no explosions with smoke and fire billowing into the air and no open-mouth noisy smooching.  As one reviewer noted, Disney, Lucas and Spielberg could well take lessons from this film. It is simply excellent and merely greatly wonderful.  My only regret as an anthropologist who specialized in working with pastoral nomads, was that I never worked with the Saami or the Tibetans [viewers who liked this film should also check out Himalaya, for a similar way of life on the other side of the world from the Saami]",

This is akin to the Cistine Chapel going six months without visitors! \n\nAs any student of early film would have discovered, the premise of &quot;A Nous La Liberte&quot; was undoubtedly &quot;lifted&quot; and used by Chaplin in his revered MODERN TIMES. Others have mentioned this aspect.\n\nThe film is a satirical comment, almost a control experiment from one viewpoint, focusing on the ideology of big business, and in regard particularly to newly gestated industrial technology, just how the individual is viewed as little more than a means to an end. A resource to be used and no more. Clair poses the question, is the worker..the LITTLE man - any more or less a free-thinking and needful entity than the embittered prisoner serving out his time?\n\nThe film follows the fortunes of two ex-cons. One makes it to the top of the industrialised ant-hill, the other makes it to the nearest sheltered alleyway or park bench. Whilst Clair experiments freely here with music and song, the Metropolis-like buildings lend a sombre note to the proceedings at hand.\n\nStylistically dated perhaps now, and the humor betrays its thirties origins, nevertheless at its core the observations made still hold true. This remains a critically important cinematic benchmark not just in terms of early French cinema but also in terms of a director&apos;s extraordinary vision so many years ago."

There is no need for another &quot;Grass&quot; type documentary -- as that one already exists. Super High Me is a comedy first and a documentary second. And that&apos;s OK. More than OK, it might even be better, because it has the potential (since it is funny and entertaining as well as informative) to reach a wider audience and make more people aware of the entire medical marijuana issue, the existence of &apos;dispensaries&apos; in California and the conflict between state and federal laws. \n\nSo is there another more activist documentary to be made about medical marijuana? Sure. But it would probably be boring and no one would really go see it. (Kinda like the fate of &quot;Grass&quot; for example.) This one is fun AND informative. And it will probably do very well and get more people talking about the issues, even more than if it were a &quot;real&quot; documentary.",

      "reviewBody": "...However as a rap-concert movie, it&apos;s one of the better ones I&apos;ve seen in quite a while. It works for a few reasons, though for some it may not work as well as for others. Basically, if you&apos;re coming into this expecting Chappelle doing more of his stand-up &amp;/or sketches, you&apos;ll wonder how you could&apos;ve been misled (not that his moments on screen don&apos;t elicit enough laughs for satisfaction, at least for a Chappelle admirer like myself)- in fact many white audience members going into the film walked out of screenings. If this is due to the film-making style or something wrong on the end of director Michel Gondry, or just not caring for the rap and hip-hop, is up for debate. But considering the kind of mix of better-than-usual rap music, solid cinema verier style camera-work by Gondry and his small crew, and the fine bits of interview footage, it&apos;s actually not a bad film if you go into it knowing what you&apos;ll get. For some it may be one of the film events of the season &amp;/or year.\n\nOne reason it worked is that- and this is of course a subjective part of seeing Block Party- the musical acts are better than most of the rap and hip-hop currently heard on radio and seen on the music channels. Led by an actual band playing music as opposed to all beat machines, the groups (of which are Chappelle&apos;s own favorites, and some of which already appeared on the hit or miss musical segments of his show) bring out solid beats, and the rappers or singers are not off-putting or ridiculous. The highlights for me were with Kanye West (with a cool, powerful mix of himself and a school band for &apos;Jesus Walks&apos;), The Roots, and the Fugee&apos;s &apos;Killing Me Softly&apos;. There are also some cool, loose moments with Chappelle and some people backstage where he jams and riffs and jokes (funny jokes too, albeit for the musician&apos;s expense more than for the audience). For someone like myself losing interest in more of the ultra-violent, idiotic and over-indulgent rap music of the day, it was not unpleasant at all to get dropped back into it with acts that were fresh and interesting (not that there aren&apos;t some mis-steps, Dead Prez and Common not being some of the highlights for me).\n\nThe other thing that made the film work though is Gondry&apos;s natural eye with his lens, as he just stands by getting down the attitudes, the emotions and little bits of life in the midst of this huge spectacle. There isn&apos;t anything outstanding in his style like with the Maysles brothers or DA Pennebaker in terms of capturing the music in action, and sometimes his focus strays to people on camera who take up a little too much time. But for the most part (with some exceptions of little moments that just don&apos;t work) his attention to the rhythm of a film, and the rhythm of film led by music- he is one of the most artistically dominant forces in music videos of the past ten or so years- is focused just right. This style also compliments Chappelle, who has a laid back kind of way of talking to people, but with a sense of humor that cuts the chase. Some of the best parts though of his moments on screen aren&apos;t expected, improvised, like the James Brown bit on stage, or his obscure ability to play two specific jazz songs on piano, or even his more juvenile jokes in jamming.\n\nIn short, it&apos;s a side of Chappelle you might not usually see at times, or with Gondry, and it all gels together for the sake of the audience that showed up for the show. Nothing too pretentious, and entertaining enough to keep those interested in their seats.",

He has a lot of Lively Set info &amp; stills at his house, including autographed pictures from James Darren, Doug McClure, Peter Mann, Marilyn Maxwell (Casey&apos;s mom), Pamela Tiffen, &amp; Joanie Summers (Chuck&apos;s girlfriend). He was selected since he worked on the Turbine car project at Chrysler Corp., was a mechanic, and had some previous racing experience. This movie&apos;s race sequence had to be re-done. One of the drivers in the original sequences (Eddie Sachs I believe) was killed at the Indianapolis 500 just prior to the movies original release. Also a car magazine (Car &amp; Driver?) had several years ago listed this movie in its top ten movies for action car scenes. My father probably has that information also. If you are interested in contacting my father for more information, etc. please send me an e-mail, and I will call him and ask.\n\nGreg Morris (later of Mission Impossible fame) was the policeman who gave Casey &amp; Chuck their tickets early in the movie.",

The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn&apos;t. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can&apos;t imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don&apos;t remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I&apos;d like to see again.",

      "reviewBody": "As a native of West Texas, I think this film is one of the finest in American cinema. You don&apos;t watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman&apos;s films (The 3 H&apos;s - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I&apos;m not what you&apos;d call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn&apos;t much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!\n\nMelvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo&apos;s Ninotchka in the &apos;30&apos;s (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world! Other commentators have addressed Hud&apos;s multi-faceted story and the incredible B&amp;W cinematography. All wonderful - but the next time you watch this true American classic, focus on Douglas&apos; Oscar-winning performance. You will be amazed! (And remind yourself of some of the early roles in romantic comedies - Ninotchka, That Uncertain Feeling, This Thing Called Love or Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House - this same actor performed so well.)",

      "reviewBody": "The story of a young carabiniere that has been assigned the job to escort a couple of minors from Milan to their native Sicily.  Stops along the way include the riviera (around Genova or Livorno), Rome, Calabria.  Travel is done by train and by car.  We see segments of italy in their socio-economic regional realities.  The folks in Calabria are seen living next to a busy road in a house with no stucco covering the bare bricks, a common tactic used in the south to qualify for a taxation exemption (being the house not completed).  Smartly filmed, it candidly reveals an Italy closer to what natives struggling to make a living would experience in having to travel along the length of the Italian booth.  This is a fictional movie, but there is an effort to make evident how realistically people live today."

One of them (I forget which) takes a girl called Marguerite to a fancy restaurant where they cannot afford anything on the menu. So they fake food poisoning and are sped to the hospital without paying. During the night he steals a nurses uniform in order to escape. All this happens before the actual plot gets started, but it shows you what kind of movie this is. It&apos;s all about getting everything for free (by taking advantage of others). Your typical comedy heroes.\n\nNow Marguerite has missed her train, so the boys &apos;borrow&apos; a bus from their fat slob of a boss to drive her and four girlfriends from Nice to KitzbÃ¼hel. They forget to take along any money, food, or even their passports but since all of them are natural born bullshit artists, they can always dupe other people into paying for them or giving them things for free. Along the way they pick up another couple of low life liars claiming to be DJ&apos;s, who add nothing to the proceedings. So now there are 4 guys and 5 girls on the bus but since 3 of the girls are quite plain, none of the guys show any interest in them (at last a hint of reality). \n\nThere is too much lame disco dancing along the way and some slapstick ski action after they arrive in KitzbÃ¼hel, but at least it never gets boring. Each scene presents a new opportunity to get away with something without paying. Also included is the usual sub plot about the girls&apos; clumsy coach trying to catch up with them and predictably two bank robbers show up near the end, to show that the lead characters are not so amoral after all all. They all become hero&apos;s when they help to catch the real baddies. Didn&apos;t every comedy in the eighties end that way?\n\n4 out of 10"

      "name": "Confusing plot, too often flat, and frequently absent Marx Brothers, but a few hilarious scenes",
      "reviewBody": "While I disagree with the conventional wisdom about the Marx Brothers&apos; film made before The Big Store, Go West (1940), believing it to be yet another one of their many masterpieces, I have to agree with the conventional wisdom about The Big Store. It has the feeling of a contractual obligation film. One, two or all three of the Marx Brothers are absent for long periods of time. The story is often confusing. The film doesn&apos;t flow very well. Some of the material featuring other performers simply doesn&apos;t work. Even when it does work, it&apos;s never as good as the Marx Brothers&apos; material, and even their work is too often strangely flat.\n\nThe Big Store is really the story of Tommy Rogers (played by famed pop singer Tony Martin). Rogers has just gained partial ownership of the Phelps Department store with the passing of a relative. However, he&apos;s not interested in the store, so he plans to sell and use the money to build a state of the art music conservatory in conjunction with his friend, Ravelli (Chico Marx). Unfortunately, not everything at the Phelps store has been on the up and up, and surviving store manager Mr. Grover (Douglass Dumbrille) is worried about buyers discovering their creative bookkeeping. So they try to off Tommy, which leads to hiring private detective Wolf J. Flywheel (Groucho Marx) and his assistant, Wacky (Harpo Marx), who happens to be Ravelli&apos;s brother. At the same time, Mr. Grover is courting Martha Phelps (Margaret Dumont), Tommy&apos;s aunt, with machinations of eventual ownership of the store.\n\nIn terms of meatiness, that&apos;s far more of a plot than I usually relay, but all of that is presented in the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film. The remainder involves playing out those threads. The problem is that the above is way too complicated, especially for a Marx Brothers film. The Marx Brothers style was that plots were really secondary to their anarchic, madcap skits. In truth, the two were usually well integrated in their films, with meatier plots than the conventional wisdom has it, and the skits relatively seamlessly enmeshed in the plots.\n\nHere, the plot is often difficult to follow, and when you do manage to follow it, it just isn&apos;t that interesting. Despite this, there are still a number of fabulous set pieces. The scene where we first meet Groucho and Harpo in Groucho&apos;s private eye office is hilarious. The bedding department scene is good. The climax, featuring an extended chase through the department store, is a lot of fun, including its cartoonish use of wire stunts and camera tricks.\n\nBut there just isn&apos;t enough of that stuff, and one of the Marx Brothers&apos; strongest points--Groucho&apos;s verbal bantering, is oddly flat just as often as it isn&apos;t. Even the usual musical sequences are problematic, unlike their sublime charm in Go West. Only Harpo&apos;s musical sequence and a brief duet with Chico on the piano are worthwhile. Groucho is given a schmaltzy &quot;big musical production number&quot; that goes on too long, is supposed to be funny and isn&apos;t, and ends up with Groucho doing little else but mugging and doing his trademark walk while other characters we&apos;re not familiar with sing the song.\n\nTony Martin has a song early on in the film that&apos;s okay, but doesn&apos;t exactly fit the tone of the film, and later, he does another &quot;big musical production number&quot;, called &quot;The Tenement Symphony&quot;, that is bizarre, to say the least, but not particularly funny. Instead, it&apos;s a strange mish-mash of styles that is strongly derivative (in a negative way) of George Gershwin.\n\nWhile Marx Brothers completest certainly can&apos;t avoid The Big Store, it&apos;s difficult to imagine this being anywhere near the top of the list for any Marx Brothers fan. It&apos;s also not a great way to introduce anyone to their work (as they&apos;re likely to not be very interested in seeing more), and there are far better films for casual viewers who are not particularly interested in the Marx Brothers.\n\nThe few hilarious scenes could easily be excised and work just as well (if not better) in isolation, as &quot;random&quot; skits. But the film is very slightly recommendable for them.",

Having made many trips to the ballpark in which the movie was filmed, and to the old-fashioned soda shoppe where Robert Redford and Glenn Close re-unite, this movie was special to all of us in Western New York. It always a kick, too, (and a bit odd) to watch the final scene since the opposing pitcher is a personal friend.\n\nI think I would have loved this movie regardless of the &quot;home-field advantage.&quot; It&apos;s an interesting, involving story that has you really rooting for Redford&apos;s character. To have actors like Close, Robert Duvall, Richard Farnsworth, Kim Basinger, Wilfred Brimley, Darren McGavin, Barabara Hershey, Robert Prosky, Joe Don Baker and others in the &quot;lineup&quot; doesn&apos;t hurt, either!\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful, too. That was something I never really appreciated until after several viewings. There are some wonderfully subdued brown and golden hues in here. This is very pretty motion picture.\n\nAll the characters - the good and the bad, and there are plenty of both - are fascinating. It&apos;s also nice to see an actor in a baseball film that actually knows how to throw, hit and field a baseball. This is a great, old-fashioned storytelling.",

I enjoyed the film and the story and I read the books in few months.\n\nI have read some opinions and I don&apos;t understand why people complain about the story and the movies. I would like to congratulate Stephanie for writing a true love story. You could think it&apos;s unreal. Fine! But it&apos;s beautiful!! I travel to real places last year and it was a great experience. I keep all this for me. The books, the places, the story, the characters!! This last movie is wonderful and in my opinion, makes you feel same feelings than the first one. Bella&apos;s evolution through the movies is surprising.\n\nIf you liked the books and the movies, you will enjoy this last movie. It has love, action and surprises and sensitive ending!!",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a little bit wary when a horror film touts itself as based on a true story, because one can only take that with a pinch of salt, given that it&apos;s a film after all, and there&apos;s a need to dress it up for the silver screen and for dramatic purposes. Moreover, having to state the events took place in less than a month, seemed a little bit far fetched, given how the screenplay played things out, which made it look like months instead. Still, for the curious, you may want to look up an article called Jinx in a Box written by Leslie Gornstein, which the events in this film is purportedly based on.\n\nSo is it any good, given that the trailer essentially told the entire story from beginning to end? It got better as it moved along, and really tested your patience in the first half of the film since it really took a long time before a turn of events leading to the first boo. It introduced the characters of a dysfunctional family, where Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has already divorced from wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), with the former getting only the weekends to spend time with daughters Hannah (Madison Davenport) and Em (Natasha Calis). The arrangements seem pretty well oiled, with Clyde having moved to another house of his own conveniently located in a new neighbourhood. As part of moving in, they pick up extra dishes at someone&apos;s backyard jumble sale, and Em gets attracted to a mysterious box, which gets bought and brought home.\n\nWarning lights are probably flashing now, since stories of old have already warned never to pick up strange looking objects from anywhere and bringing them home. Opening Pandora&apos;s Box is also something nobody should do, and when done, welcomes a whole lot of trouble. Em becomes possessed and Natasha Calis almost got a chance to be the next Linda Blair in The Exorcist, except that The Possession minus all the kinky moves that would make parents frown and grown ups blush. Make up also helped to make her look her zombie best, coupled with fans borrowed from a Bollywood studio to let her hair fly around when the air around is still. And for those who object her bout of violent behaviour, especially when becoming possessive and protective of the mysterious box, even stranger things happen, and her unusual behaviour soon triggers Clyde to do some sleuthing of his own.\n\nCredit must be given when credit is due, so Danish director Ole Bornedal did what he could in avoiding the usual clichÃ©s of slamming doors and jump scares. Instead, the focus was on building atmospherics through the use of creepy crawlies, and he succeeded to an extent in doing that. It took a while to build up a story, which could have done a lot more with its context of dismissing the change of the child&apos;s behaviour because of the psychological pressures in dealing with her parents&apos; divorce, but this never really quite took off.\n\nInstead, the last half hour floored the pedal to the metal, moving at breakneck speed and allowed a battle of good and evil, and dealing with a parent&apos;s undying love for his child, complete with self-sacrificing gesture to try and lure the evil that is inside. While there are a whole host of exorcist type films of late, to varying degrees of success and presentation, this one probably was one of the first that I&apos;ve seen that was a Jewish exorcism, not involving a priest but a rabbi (Matisyahu) instead, with certain rites performed I&apos;m sure didn&apos;t had much of an authentic ring to it (I may be wrong). And to make things a little laughable, there was a scene where Clyde thought he could do it alone through the learning of the rites on Vimeo (wonder how much they had to pay to displace YouTube), before seeking professional help.\n\nBut the unforgivable element in the film, is the editing. For all the good work that was done in the film, with the actors trying their best to flesh out a relatively flimsy storyline, everything got let down by the poor, poor editing. This probably came from having 2 editors in Eric Beason and Anders Villadsen handle the film, so one can only speculate on the clash of ideas. Ultimately it really reflected their weak editing skills and the limited scope of their abilities, making almost every transition here a fade to black, probably the only technique they can both agree on. This irritates since it&apos;s so frequently used, especially at the beginning of the film, and made it all worst when it was used so carelessly in the gripping finale, totally spoiling the mood and threw a spanner in the works. It&apos;s really choppy work, got in the way and drew attention to itself, so it was bewildering why the filmmakers had let this pass, rather than to fire them both and get someone else instead.",

The script is incoherent and the action sequences are poorly staged (including one of the least satisfying car chases and one of the least satisfying catfights ever). The &quot;special effects&quot; of the plane crash are positively embarrassing. But at least it moves fast enough and I was never actually bored with it. It also offers the chance to see that Barbara Bouchet was aging quite gracefully in the 1980&apos;s. Speaking of the 1980&apos;s, fans of that glorious decade will appreciate the music score, as well as the disco and aerobics sequences! *1/2 out of 4.",

      "reviewBody": "It amazes me how people go on and on about the racism involved within the skinhead scene and how it does not exist. To say Nazi skinheads do not exist and the next sentence defend left and gay skins is a contradiction in terms. Nazi skinheads like left skinheads are political and both simply use the skinhead name to attract new members usually brain dead people who are rejected from traditional skinhead crews. As for gay skinheads not once in my 25 years as a skinhead have I came across an OI, Ska, Left or right crew that accepts Gay members. There is no such thing as a gay skinhead and there never will be. like it or not skinheads have been into violence and racism since day one in the 60s. The West Indians and English kids would often participate in Paki bashing. This film shows the real facts and is 100% without bias. The majority of skinheads like me hate politics, enjoy music, drinking, football and hanging with our mates. If provoked will not walk away! We are simply working class from all backgrounds. Great movie!",

In a mythic version of the situation after World War II people find an overturned trolleycar far outside of town, right it, and begin mostly pushing it toward the city, joined by other wandering individuals. The people, with great faces and mostly respectable ways, succeed at cooperating, though with some squabbles and disasters. The time is also mythic, and not a historical allegory as far as this foreigner can tell, with new born twins showing up later aged 2 or 3. The characters are what is important, and one does get glimpses of their stories, and would enjoy learning more. Besides the good performers, there are great images, though on a much lower budget that Werner Herzog had to get Fitzcarraldo over the mountains. A good video rental place should have the film, since the director has gone on to great things, including the recent &quot;Being Julia.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Set in undetermined future society where robotics are a major part of everyday life, from performing household chores to construction and more, Runaway follows Officer Jack Ramsay (Tom Selleck), head of the so-called &apos;Runaway Squad&apos;. His hi-tech unit deals with out of control robots, intervening where humans may be endangered by the machines&apos; malfunctions. When Ramsay discovers a plot by criminal genius Luther (Gene Simmons) to sell advanced microchips and cutting edge weaponry to the highest bidder, he finds himself taking on not only Luther, but also the dangerous killer&apos;s deadly robotic creations.\n\nWritten and directed by the late Michael Crichton, Runaway continues the theme of the dangers of technology affecting the lives of humans that had been previously visited in his previous works Westworld and Looker. Reviewing Runaway now, thirty years after it&apos;s original release, is a real eye opener to Crichton&apos;s foresight. Although the appearance of the technology in the movie is dated, being all microchips, clunky robots, switches and video tapes, there are things that have equivalents today. These include flying drones (&apos;floaters&apos;), tablet-like devices, the ease of gaining information through computer profiles of individuals, nannying by technology and the rapacious pervasiveness of the media. These features are integrated subtly and skilfully into the fabric of the film, helping Runaway maintain a surprising degree of relevance so far down the line. The movie is also notable for it&apos;s &apos;bullet-eye view&apos; scenes, which were ground breaking in it&apos;s day and much imitated thereafter.\n\nThere&apos;s plenty to enjoy here as proceedings are quick and unfussy, the plot is purposeful and the action comes thick and fast, with Crichton really building up the tension and thrills during several standout scenes. Although some of the effects are a trifle creaky looking nowadays, the robotics are imaginative and well constructed. The performances are as equally enjoyable, with Selleck and Cynthia Rhodes (as Jack&apos;s partner) working well together. The underrated G.W. Bailey (of Police Academy infamy) also does a great turn as Jack&apos;s Chief and even a sizzling Kirstie Alley makes an appearance. The only letdown is from KISS legend Simmons, as although can he certainly deliver menacing looks and thousand yard stares, his overall acting ability is somewhat lacking. A much better rock star than actor, that&apos;s for sure.\n\nWhile the movie is dated in parts, it&apos;s fast pace and inventiveness, along with Crichton&apos;s skillful direction helps Runaway stand up very well when viewed in the modern day. Whether revisiting or seeing it for the first time, Runaway is an oft-overlooked pulp thriller that&apos;s well worth catching.",

Meanwhile the girlfriend of Helsing&apos;s nephew, Jim, is taken as a drone by Nadja.  Jim and Van Helsing set out to stop the reign of the Dracula family and stop their blood lust.\n\nI didn&apos;t even know this was about the Dracula legend when I sat to watch it, just the title drew me and the cast sounded quite promising.  The black and white, shaky shots, post modern slant and grainy camera work were both a draw and a turn off for me.  On one hand it was very arty, deliberately sticking a finger up to the mainstream. I dislike this feeling - one that the multiplex crowd are unworthy of any film and that the director wouldn&apos;t care to have their film be successful and hence uses such things with abandon.  However it also made the film much more imaginative and interesting if it had all been full Technicolor with steadicam and nicely framed shots, it was pretty hip and I enjoyed it even if I felt like it was aimed at the art crowd rather than just being a film for anyone or everyone.\n\nThe story is quite good, albeit just a twist on the old story of Dracula. The script is where the main difference lies.  It is quite talky a film but it is better for it.  The dialogue is a little pretentious at times but it is interesting and involving.  In terms of characters I&apos;m afraid it falls down quite badly - the grainy images and dialogue that is far from `down to earth&apos; stop the characters from ever being real people or even characters that I felt deeply involved in - but happily it wasn&apos;t to the point that I was completely disinterested in them.  That&apos;s not to say it was great - but it was different enough to keep me interested, even if I wasn&apos;t gripped by it at any point.  Likewise with the direction, I felt there was imagination but that it went too far to the point of just being experimental and arty for the sake of it.  If you are making a film with as good a cast as this had then why on earth would you use a child&apos;s camera unless you were trying to be arty?  This mindset did feel through the whole film and it was, as I&apos;ve already said, a pretty big turn off for me.\n\nThe cast is great on paper but they struggle with the pretentious dialogue and the fact that the film loses them in a grainy black &amp; white world.  I will always watch Donovan but that doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s any good.  Here he is alright but has precious little to actually do!  Fonda is better and plays his character with a sense of humour that the wider film could well have benefited from - I wonder if the director got annoyed by Fonda not playing it straight when he clearly had arty aspirations.  Lowensohn is not only beautiful but acts well in the title role but the astonishingly named Galaxy Craze was pretty much cardboard as Lucy.\n\nOverall this is an interesting movie but it struggles under the weight of it&apos;s own pretensions.  I found it to be different enough visually and script-wise to be interesting and even I found the apparent concerted effort to alienate the mainstream to be slightly off putting.  An interesting effort but one that will irritate far more viewers than it will please."

There are many little things in this movie, little details and gags, that increase the movie&apos;s replayability. The acting is amazing. Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort have wonderful chemistry,which is a tribute to the their acting ability, as well as the tight writing and solid direction. I was sad that this movie did not garner more recognition than it did when it was released. I am also disappointed that Bud Cort has not starred in more things since this movie.  Oh well. This is a good Hal Ashby movie to start with, but if you get a chance you should watch as many as possible.  They are quirky, thoughtful and wonderful. &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; is a paean to life and love, even if it&apos;s in the weirdest places."

      "reviewBody": "Good war movies are all anti-war movies. &apos;Circle of Deceit&apos; (the original German title is &apos;Die FÃ¤lschung&apos;) released on screen in 1981 confirms this. The film occupies a special place in the creation of the German director Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff. It is a political film and a personal film, the last of the director&apos;s first creation period, the last of his films in which the heroes live passionate love stories, derailed or made impossible by wars or social conflicts. Most of the story takes place in Beirut and in the Lebanon torn by civil war, but the political message mainly refers to the relationship between the Western society consuming journalistic sensations and the conflicts that take place in seemingly distant areas of the world (at least so they seemed at that time).\n\nGeorg Laschen, the main hero of the film, played by the wonderful actor who was Bruno Ganz, is a war reporter. Two revolutions took place in the reporting and dissemination of international news in the 40 years that have passed since the making of this film. At the end of the 1980s, it was the emergence of cable news which became popular enough in a short time, so that the fall of the Berlin Wall or the first Gulf War were broadcast live worldwide, and the news consumers were exposed directly to the images of the occurring events. A few years later, the Internet became ubiquitous, and every owner of a laptop or mobile phone became not only a consumer of news 24 hours a day, but also a potential source of news and images, instantly accessible anywhere. In the early 1980s, however, the responsibility for generating news was still entrusted to a small group of reporters broadcasting from the hot areas of the globe. The potential to inform and misinform was also present, then as now, in any report and the information has since become commodity. Reporters and photographers risked their lives (for a consistent pay in many cases) but what reached the news consumers were the sensational information, politically filtered by the editors, chosen according to the fashion of the day and the public&apos;s current interest for one cause or another. In the film, a flight of several hours transported the hero from the comfortable and safe world in which his only problems were those related to the family, in an area of war where life and violence coexisted in a way that can be understood only by those who have lived in such a part of the world. The process of knowledge that Georg Laschen goes through is not only a course of political education that leads him to reviewing his opinions about good and evil, justice and truth, but also one of personal knowledge. Can love be a savior, or any relationship is just an escapist fun, an illusory and temporary refuge? Can one rely on himself in limit situations? What are the limits? What is any of us able to do to in order to survive?\n\n&apos;Circle of Deceit&apos; offers to Bruno Ganz the opportunity of one of his top creations, and it reinforces my opinion that he was one of the best, if not the best German film actor of the last half century. Hanna Schygulla plays the ambiguous role of a woman who chooses to live her life, femininity, motherhood in the neighborhood of death. This is perhaps not her best role. Much of the filming took place on location in Beirut, in a relatively safe area but close enough to the conflict to provide not only authentic scenery and extras, but also the noises and images of the conflict seen from short distance. This is one of the most realistic films about and against the war that I have seen, a film that blows up the boundaries between fiction and reality, between &apos;art&apos; and documentary. The director uses in many scenes the style of war reporting, and after a while violence becomes the normal, while the scenes of normal life turn into surrealist experiences. The film was made 40 years ago, and can be considered &apos;historic&apos; in its details of the Lebanese civil war. In the 40 years since the filming of &apos;Circle of Deceit&apos; we saw similar images of war, terrorism, destruction, from many other parts of the world in fiction films and in the news. The change is that distances seem to have become smaller, the seemingly distant conflicts became actuality for all areas of the world because of the flow of refugees or the global export of terrorism. The individual confrontation with the absurdity of war and violence as true as ever.",
