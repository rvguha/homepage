      "reviewBody": "ON THE BUSES was the UK&apos;s top sitcom in the early 1970&apos;s,but this extraordinary fact is hard to believe 3 decades later.What&apos;s even more astonishing is despite this (1971) being the year of THE FRENCH CONNECTION,A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and GET CARTER,the film was the most successful at the UK box office this year.\n\nThe very thin plot is carried along further by Reg Varney and Bob Grant laughing at their own(mostly feeble) puns and double entendres,a leering,grotesquely stereotyped view of the young women in view,and a script that makes even the most sub-standard CARRY ON film seem like Shakespeare.\n\nThe TV show itself lasted until 1973,and two further film sequels followed,but the bawdy traditions of this first ON THE BUSES effort continued with even more excess with the CONFESSIONS series starring Robin Askwith;again the first of this series topped the UK box office in 1974.\n\nAs a Briton,I can assure the US we&apos;ve all grown up and matured since those days!"

      "reviewBody": "We have long admired Chilean director Andres Wood. Having seen his &quot;Historias del futbol&quot; and &quot;La fiebre del loco&quot;, we were eagerly anticipating the arrival of his new film &quot;La buena vida&quot;. Co-written for the screen by Rodrigo Bazaes and Mamoun Hassan, this film follows in the favorite narrative of a lot of Latin American creators, most notably Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, and his long time collaborator, Guillermo Arriaga.\n\nSupposedly, this film is based, loosely, one would suspect, in real stories. We are taken to meet a few people in Santiago that have nothing to do with one another, much less, know anyone of the other characters in the story, yet, at some point of the film their lives touch each and everyone of the lives of the people being followed.\n\nAs the film opens, we are taken to a class being directed at what appears to be a group of prostitutes where they are shown how to avoid being exposed to AIDS, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Teresa, the therapist, needs all the help she can get; unknown to her, her teen age daughter is pregnant. Her estranged husband is fond of visiting places where encounters can be easily arranged by the same women Teresa is trying to teach safe sex.\n\nThe next story centers around a male beautician, Edmundo, who at the start of the movie goes to ask for a loan. Esmeralda, the lending officer, tells him in no uncertain terms he has no chances in what he wants to secure because he has no collateral. Esmeralda, who feels attracted to the man, becomes involved in an affair with Edmundo that seems to go nowhere. Edmundo, who wants to convince his mother to help him financially, gets no help from anyone. Eventually, Esmeralda realizes he is not the man for her.\n\nThe third narrative involves a talented clarinetist, Mario, who goes for an audition with the Philharmonic. His performance is rudely interrupted by the judges, who don&apos;t seem to pay attention to the musicians they are supposed to rate. Mario&apos;s most treasured possession is the clarinet his girlfriend gave him as a gift and which he takes to all important dates. When the orchestra position doesn&apos;t materialize, Mario applies, and gets a position with the police band.\n\nThe last and most eluding story involves a woman who is obviously a prostitute who is seen with a young child. She appears to be sick. She cuts a tragic figure snubbed by other street workers because of her appearance.\n\nWhat Andres Wood has accomplished is excellent performances from all the principals. Aline Kuppenheim, stands out as the tormented Teresa. She gives a nuanced performance. Eduardo Paxeco makes a valuable contribution as the taciturn Mario, who knows that in spite of having a great talent, he is ignored by the people that can help him. Roberto Farias is seen as Edmundo, in a role that was tailor-made to show his abilities.\n\n&quot;La buena vida&quot; is highly recommended for lovers of good cinema thanks to the work of Andres Wood, its director.",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won&apos;t be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that &apos;Bloody Birthday&apos; is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don&apos;t just refer to this film as being &apos;another 80&apos;s slasher&apos; because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We&apos;re introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the moment they were delivered, planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and, due to this, the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience. This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree.\n\nGranted, this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but, seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period, it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the kids&apos; acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murders sequences are grim and tense, and it&apos;s always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids. I don&apos;t know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable. The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights, such as &apos;Village of the Damned&apos;, &apos;The Bad Seed&apos; and &apos;Children of the Damned&apos;. This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this. \n\nBloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema, but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like &apos;The Brain&apos; and &apos;Starship Invasions&apos;. If all this isn&apos;t enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the star of TV-series &apos;Jake and the Fatman&apos;. Check it out!!",

      "reviewBody": "Podrugi (Girlfriends) is the story of the friendship between three girls, who start the film aged around 10 and who grow up together, eventually becoming nurses at the Russian front during the First World War. It was directed by Lev Arnshtam and featured a music score by Dmitri Shostakovich, their third collaboration following on from The Golden Mountains (1931) and Counterplan (1932) for which Arnshtam wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe narrative is straightforward and the storyline only mildly interesting but it is for the music that the film holds interest today, especially as it remains unrecorded apart from three preludes released on a rare Russian Melodiya LP in 1988 (C10 26307 004). The score is unusual in that much of the music is for string quartet although piano, trumpet and timpani are sometimes utilised. There are also passages for organ and later an electronic instrument, probably a Theremin, played in a drunken fashion and a couple of cues for full orchestra. Altogether there a significant amount of musical material contained within the film and a new recording would certainly be an interesting and valuable addition to the catalogue and much overdue.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion on this and other films with music by Shostakovich see Dmitri Shostakovich: A Life in Film, written by John Riley and published by I. B. Tauris, London and New York in the series Kinofiles Film Companion, 2004.",

Ryan Reynolds shouldn&apos;t be the one to lead the movie. Melissa George should be the lead. She can be afraid of Reynolds. She can be conflicted about the new man as a father for her children. There are all kinds of avenues this could have taken.\n\nThe creepiest thing that happened is the super sexy babysitter (Rachel Nichols) for the kids. Would any parents really just walk off without a second look when the babysitter is dressed like that? And it gets super awkward with the sex talk.",

This monumentally emotional moment for mankind, albeit thoroughly superfluous scientific achievement, is the background for this beautifully constructed film.\n\nThe thing that makes this film so special is the fact that there isn&apos;t a character that appears on screen that you don&apos;t care about, regardless how small the role. That takes true writing and directing talent!\n\n The entire small town of Parks, New South Wales, Australia is all atwitter, because their radio observatory dish has been chosen to be NASA&apos;s official link to the Apollo 11 mission in the southern hemisphere. The mayor&apos;s wife comments, while serving her joint of lamb, that man being moments away from landing on the moon makes their problems seem mundane... That&apos;s the beauty of the film, you care so much about these people; their problems are anything but mundane - you cheer-on the techno-nerd asking the town beauty to go out with him; you ache inside because the head of the observatory lost his wife a year ago and she can&apos;t be there to revel in his glory; you love the fact that the out-of-place NASA official is the only one who realizes that all the mayor&apos;s rebellious teenage daughter really needs to chill-out is an ounce of respect.\n\nThis is the best kind of feel-good film. An absolute jewel that you&apos;ll want to watch more than just once."

But now that I&apos;m content, in this new phase of life, I find myself annoyed by people who create their own drama and then whine about it. So I would not have enjoyed the book if I were to read it now. Although everyone does a good job in this film, and the scenery is breathtaking -- now I want to go to Rome!!!-- I really couldn&apos;t stand Liz. She has everything but whines about how &quot;I don&apos;t even know how to be HERE!&quot; I meet people in my new job who are fighting cancer every day -- they deserve the opportunity to whine (and few do, I might add). But pretty people who have everything and think they deserve more just tick me off. And it was a long painful sit. I do love the men in this movie -- each one of them is so good. And Julia Roberts does what she can with this selfish character. I just don&apos;t want to spend any more time with spoiled Liz. The time I spent watching her only ticked me off. I cannot recommend it, unless you&apos;re self centered, indulged and rich -- this could be your inspiration. Phoo!",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s such a shame they can&apos;t make gritty down-and-dirty movies like they did in the 1970s anymore. And CHARLEY VARRICK is a fine specimen of the exciting, brutal, honest approach to movies in that decade. We&apos;ve become so accustomed to seeing Walter Matthau in comedies like GRUMPY OLD MEN that at first you&apos;d wonder if he could pull his part off as Varrick convincingly (well, he also played a crook in KING CREOLE and a detective in THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE, TWO THREE, for openers). It turns out that Matthau is very good here, playing a small-time bank robber, a common-man type who&apos;s latest take unexpectedly winds up being laundered Mafia loot! Now he has to outsmart the mobsters as well as their sadistic hit-man and the police, all of whom are hot on his trail.\n\nEveryone in this film is out for all he/she can get. I have to take a moment to acknowledge Joe Don Baker in particular. As the punchy, no-nonsense, wisecracking hit-man he provides many fun moments and is a real standout. He&apos;s perfectly cast, but then so really is most everyone (Woodrow Parfrey, Sheree North, Andy Robinson and John Vernon - the dean from NATIONAL LAMPOON&apos;S ANIMAL HOUSE). Don Siegel keeps us interested throughout, and one nice scene in particular struck me when Parfrey and Vernon are having a discussion near the cow field. Their dialogue and acting is done practically in one long take that keeps us focused just by the sheer talents of the actors being allowed to do their thing. I wonder if this is a lost art with the now ever-moving MTV camera styles and edits of the 21st Century? I should mention I also enjoyed the unpredictable climax.\n\nThey just don&apos;t make movies like this anymore - unless you count the great Quentin Tarantino, who undoubtedly likes this film himself and seems to have borrowed some of it for his own work (there&apos;s even a line from VARRICK that was reheated for PULP FICTION). *** out of ****",

They&apos;re simply charming and as much as people may want to dislike Kidman for being Ms. Cruise, she again proves she&apos;s a star in her own right.\n\nForget the critics and the Be-faithful-to-the-book drones, this is a good movie- hip, edgy and sometimes spooky.  If this was a movie made by two unknown actresses, it would be a &quot;gem&quot; critics would recommend to audiences, but for some reason with Bullock and Kidman, it gets reviewed on a different scale and ends up short for people.  Forget all that- it&apos;s great entertainment with yes, two pretty big stars- but they can&apos;t help that so get over it and enjoy the movie for what it is- a real &quot;gem.&quot;"

Seeing this wonderful comedy for the first time was the movie-watching equivalent of discovering buried treasure.\n\nOne of the marks of an excellent comedy is one that you can watch a number of times and still laugh involuntarily even though you know what is coming. The performances of Matthau and May, as well as the supporting cast are that priceless.\n\nSo many funny and memorable scenes, but a couple of my favorites are: the meeting between Henry Graham (Matthau) and his accountant Beckett (Redfield) as Beckett tries to contain his frustration and explain to Matthau that his money is gone (&quot;perfect&quot;); and the scene where Graham crawls to his rich uncle (James Coco) to ask to borrow money while the uncle is favoring an electric pepper mill during his lavish meal (the expressions on Matthau&apos;s face are exquisite).\n\nA delightful, black romantic comedy that somehow manages to be very light, and as a bonus even subtly tosses out some profound truths.",

      "name": "THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR FACE (Corrado Farina, 1971) ***",
      "reviewBody": "A largely unknown but highly rewarding Euro-Cult gem that transposes the ancient Transylvanian vampire legend into the commercialized industrial age of 1970s Italy; director Farina is perhaps best-known (if at all) for the Carroll Baker-starring adult comic-strip adaptation BABY YAGA (1973) – a film which I was kind of lukewarm on at first glance but would now love to revisit (for the record, I do own the Blue Underground DVD of it). The mostly anonymous cast is headed by distinguished character actor Adolfo Celi (playing the all-powerful tycoon Giovanni Nosferatu) and whose underlings include one Harker, one Van Helsing, etc.!; the hero of the piece is played by Giuliano Disperati (who reminded me of a less handsome version of Hurd Hatfield) and their female counterparts are essayed by Geraldine Hooper (as Celi&apos;s androgynous secretary) and red-headed hottie Francesca Modigliani (portraying a bare-breasted hippy who hitches a ride in Disperati&apos;s car and stays on). Obviously, Jean-Luc Godard had already paid similar tribute to F.W. Murnau&apos;s Silent vampire masterpiece in his own iconic neo-noir/sci-fi opus ALPHAVILLE (1965) by naming the Howard Vernon character as Professor Nosferatu von Braun; the beauty of Farina&apos;s – and co-writer/assistant director/editor Giulio Berruti (who would go on to direct the middling nunsploitation/slasher KILLER NUN [1978]) – concept, however, is that (as the film&apos;s very title implies) vampires have nowadays changed their faces and instead of sporting bloodied fangs and enveloping cloaks, they don suits, haunt business boardrooms and prey upon millions of gullible TV viewers via puerile (but obviously effective) commercials! The film&apos;s initial stages have a deceptively light-hearted air about them: predating the amiable &quot;Fantozzi&quot; comedy series of movies by four years, Disperati cannot believe his luck in being invited to meet the elusive President of the firm he works for (who inhabits the 20th floor on which, apparently, only a handful of people have ever been to); when Disperati is invited to Nosferatu&apos;s country house, he is made to listen to commercials whenever he gets to sit on the sofa or take a shower! Even so, the subtle choral music on the soundtrack ominously underscores the sinister air of the rural surroundings – represented by Nosferatu&apos;s omnipresent watchdog army of white Fiat 500 which &apos;accompany&apos; every visitor to the villa. Needless to say, the usual expected elements of vampire movies are also present in the mix here: the crypt housing Nosferatu&apos;s decaying coffin; the midnight secret meeting of the Vampire and his acolytes (here made up of, among others, a Renfield-like advertising agent dreading his boss&apos; reaction to his clips and even an ecclesiastical authority who imparts his blessing on the latter&apos;s work vis-a-vis censorship issues, etc.). Despite Disperati&apos;s apparent shooting of Nosferatu (whose main relaxation activity is taking target practice on moaning puppets!), the eventual climactic defection to the cause – conformism to the consumerist mentality – of both hero and (the sadly largely absent) heroine does not really come as a surprise and concludes the movie on a satisfying ROSEMARY&apos;S BABY-like coda.",

This movie seeks to add to the brainwashing effect that those fanatics in the euphoric movement, those self absorbed in colour and light and sound fail to see as literally the worship of HILLSONG itself. As such it would be blasphemous and idolatry in its continual use of light to imply the actual, literal presence of god, no, it was light, it was angelic singing, and slick production. Even this movie, with its million dollar budget is just a mass of mind manipulation through sound and light.

      "name": "First class Norwegian coming-of-age drama; highly psychological story about human search for love",
      "reviewBody": "As a Pole, I do not know many Norwegian films since they are very rare in my country. Nevertheless, the Polish TV broadcast this movie recently on Easter time as a sort of challenge. Although nothing special drew my attention in the title, I felt curious to see this film because of my interest in Norway, its culture and foremost its people and their lifestyles. Therefore, Torun Lian&apos;s movie highly surprised me as a real masterwork.\n\nThe most significant aspect of the film is, I think, the sophisticated but profound content. An eleven year-old girl, Maria (Thea Sophie Rusten), copes with the recovery from the loss of her brother. Moreover, she does not feel loved because her family is divided. Her mother has huge difficulties with getting over her despair. Therefore, Maria is sent to her grandmother&apos;s where she stays for a longer time and where she primarily wants to be left alone. One day, however, she meets a boy at her age, Jacob (Jan Tore Kristoffersen), who also copes with the loss but in a totally different way. These two youngsters find their time enjoyable and Maria slowly feels more secure socially. In the end, Maria meets her mum and though still in a shock, a smile appears on Maria&apos;s face... Does it mean she finds love?...\n\nThere is, of course, no action in the film. Instead, the director draws our attention to psychological aspects of the human being. Though children, Maria and Jacob are very mature, draw very profound conclusions, see the world differently than other eleven year-old because they are more experienced. The indefatigable search for love is expressed throughout in Maria&apos;s behavior. Moreover, a starting erotic sympathy raises in the two youngsters. There are excellent moments when this is showed with some sensual references. Jacob starts to look at Maria in a different way but it is, of course, very pure and delicate. Less knowledgeable audiences may find nothing erotic in the film. And that is gentleness of the script! I loved the moment when they sit together on a staircase and look at each other without saying many words. It is important just to be... Their farewell is also very moving. The viewer gets an impression that these are no children but young adults.\n\nThe performances are wonderful. Although most of the time on screen is given to Maria and Jacob, the young actors are real artists. Thea Sofie Rusten can wonderfully express different psychological states, from anger, rebel, sorrow to a raising happiness and more stable security. She is breathtaking in the role! Jan Tore Kristoffersen is also very appealing as Jacob. He feels comfortable in the role and does his job very naturally. The film has one of the very best youth performances I have ever seen.\n\nFinally, the brilliant sentimental moments that the film is filled with have left an unfading trace in my memory. The leaves being moved by the blowing wind, the rain drops falling onto the windows, the streets of Bergen in the storm. These are rare things seen in movies but they are a real feast for all fans of psychological films. Human is, as a matter of fact, a part of nature and his/her states are also inevitably attached to the natural world.\n\n&quot;Bare Skyer Beveger Stjernene&quot; is a wonderful film that I would never hesitate to see once again and I would recommend to everyone bored with brutality, murders, and the lack of profound level of thinking in many modern films. See this one if you find chance. Pity Torun Lian&apos;s film is not famous! This is a real treasure of the Norwegian cinema! The film that shows one thing: to live means primarily to love and find love.",

      "reviewBody": "Upon seeing this film back at 2017 when it came out on Netflix, I was expecting a very groundbreaking animated adventure that would rank to the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks. Unfortunately, what I got was an OK flick with some good visuals but a very underwhelming story. It&apos;s not a terrible film, don&apos;t get me wrong, but it could&apos;ve been so much better.\n\nLet&apos;s start with the problems. The story has a very nice idea, a movie that takes place in the Sahara desert with a Romeo and Juliet-esque twist. Execution-wise, however, it falls into predictable territory and has cliches we&apos;ve seen before in other animated films. Not to mention that it does drag somewhat slowly in places. While it does have some bits of funny humor, the script includes some adult references that are way too inappropriate for some viewers. Also, the characters didn&apos;t leave an impact to the story and end up being shallow and underdeveloped.\n\nThat being said, there are some good things to admire about this film. The voice acting from everyone involved is fairly good especially the English dub (I might want to watch the film in french audio with subtitles someday since this was made by another animation studio in France), the music score fits the setting of the film very well, there are some moments where the action gets very interesting, and the best part is the animation. From the most unique animal designs of the characters to the nicely detailed look of the Sahara desert which makes the film worth watching because of it.\n\nOverall, this film makes for passable entertainment. It doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of the story and characters, but it&apos;s beautiful animation and a good music score makes this a flawed, but interesting animated movie made from France. If you have kids, give this one a shot. For the adults though, they probably won&apos;t get anything out of this.",

That is the main problem with this film. While the hallucinations initially look impressive and quite enjoyably surreal, they lose their impact quickly and soon become quite dull. \n\n However, the film can be quite enjoyable as a snapshot of late sixties Californian psychedelia (all the weird, colourful paintings on walls, and almost every second sentence ending in &quot;man&quot;).\n\nPeter Fonda is quiet bland as the executive, but Dennis Hopper is worth watching in his role as a drug dealer.  \n\nIt is worth watching if you&apos;re interested in late-sixties psychedelia, LSD, Peter Fonda or drug movies, others may want to pass."

      "reviewBody": "What makes this one of the most popular sports films of all time isn&apos;t just the sport, it&apos;s because it&apos;s such a human-interest film, such a wonderful story of giving people second chances in life. Add a true-life David beat Goliath story and you have an appealing film.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t hurt that Gene Hackman is the star, either. He may not have that celebrity appeal or the looks of Clark Gable or Bratt Pitt, but this man can flat-out act! He makes a very believable high school basketball coach who is tough-but-fair on the outside and soft-and-compassionate on the inside.\n\nThe story of an extremely tiny school defying the odds and becoming a state champion in dramatic form was so inspiring that this film has played thousands of times for 20 years now by high school coaches to their kids for motivation.\n\nBut the key to the story is the coach getting a second chance in life to do what he loves and does best and he, in turn, giving others a second chance such as the alcoholic here played by Dennis Hopper. There are great lessons on teamwork, patience, tolerance and a whole bunch of other qualities. In one of the DVD documentaries, both Hackman and Hoppper comment on how many times people have approached them and THIS is the movie they mention that meant so much them. That says a lot since both men have made many famous movies.\n\nAn unsung hero of this movie is the cinematography. Man, this is beautifully filmed and the rural Midwest has never looked so pretty and appealing. It paints a beautiful picture of this part of the United States. It also paints a fond remembrance of the early 1950s. You get an honest-to-goodness feel of what it&apos;s like to be part of a basketball in this area during that time, \n\nBasketball meant an awful lot - and still does - to these folks. If you are sports fan in particularly, this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes. However, this story is for everyone who believes people deserve chances to overcome previous mistakes. Few films, whatever the topic, have the &quot;heart&quot; this movie demonstrates.",

      "reviewBody": "A German ballet school for girls is the setting for mysterious deaths, in this 1977 horror story, written and directed by Dario Argento.  &quot;Suspiria&quot; is a visually stunning film.\n\nThe images contain objects we recognize, like people, buildings, and interior decor.  But the objects seem vaguely menacing, and less real than surreal, as though they symbolize ideas, repressed desires, or subconscious fears.  The vivid, rich colors, strange camera angles, deep shadows, and bright light piercing through darkness, all contribute to the impression that the viewer is trapped in someone else&apos;s nightmare.\n\nOne haunting segment of the film takes place in a huge, and strangely empty, public square, at night.  A blind man and his German shepherd dog stand in the middle of the square, surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style.  Some professional reviewers of this film have suggested that the public square is a veiled reference to Hitler and Nazism. Indeed, one could argue that the film&apos;s subtext is an indictment of fascism.\n\n&quot;Suspiria&quot; is not for everyone.  It is unsettling, and at times grisly.  The plot is weak, and plot elements are not really explained.  The acting is largely irrelevant.  And while the background music is suitably gothic, it is also frantic and monotonous.\n\nThe best approach to this &quot;art-house&quot; film is to ignore the superficial plot, and focus instead on the fabulous cinematography, and the gothic images as conceptual metaphors.",

Everything on Sci Fi is talky but this has the most annoying lead character ever. And is sounds to me like they have encouraged him to improvise...not a good idea. Then, when things seem unbearable, more bad acting comes along with his friends. There is no mood, or pacing, it drags and stumbles and it makes one wonder if anyone was actually supervising this dog. The zombies have okay make up but who cares when you hate the people they are trying to eat. And their are probably six action scenes in the whole thing. It reminds me of a kids at cowboys and Indians where the storytellers don&apos;t have any concept of the audience. Who is the audience anyway. I blame sci fi for this one, it seems like their only criteria somewhat high production values and a David Keith. I say check out Bloody Bill if you want this story done better.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the best documentaries ever to come to the screen &quot;The Hallstrom Chronicle&quot; is not only educational about the insect world but visually stunning with its eye popping microscopic and telescopic photography showing the viewer a world that for the most part he or she are almost totally unaware of.\n\nWere introduced to Prof. Niles Hellstrom, Lawrence Pressman, who&apos;s study of the insect world has had him become greatly alarmed in that the final battle of mankind would not be among itself in an Armageddon like nuclear holocaust but in a life and death confrontation with the what seems like indestructible insect! The insects who&apos;ve been around for some 300 million years are the only creatures on earth who can give man a run for his money living space and food supply. In fact besides man the insect is the only species on earth who&apos;s population has increased instead of diminished over the last two or three centuries! with the insects now threatening the worlds food supply,like it did since Biblical times, and killing far more people, with insect borne diseases, then all the wars of mankind put together it&apos;s only a matter of time according to Prof. Hellstrom before man not insect will disappear off the face of the earth! That&apos;s unless man learns to live within his environment and not end up killing himself in wars pollution and nuclear radiation which the insect has over the centuries, unlike man, became completely immune to!\n\nA film not to be taken lightly &quot;The Hellstrom Chronicle&quot; is just as effective now as it was back in 1971 when it was released in showing that man is not in control of his own destiny but he for either good or bad has to work within the world he lives in and the life forms he share it with in oder to survive. The insect world is by far the biggest threat to mans survival and the sooner man realizes that the better chance he has to survive in the future.\n\nThe fact that insects have shown that they can survive and even increase despite everything that man throws at them, like DDT and other insecticides, should tells us something. They unlike man have only one thought, if thats what you can call it, in mind survival of the species! Something that man in his greed and arrogance has yet to learn in his obsession of destroying himself in both wars and polluting the world that he lives in. The insect world seems to have no problem or worries in its future existence. It&apos;s been around for hundreds of millions of years and will continue to be around for countless more long after man like the dinosaurs have disappeared and been forgotten off the pages of history.",

      "reviewBody": "Tim Burton&apos;s new &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is actually a remake--excuse me, a &quot;re-imagining&quot;--of the first TWO movies of the old series.  Its occasional paraphrasing of lines from the original movie (devoid of any meaningful context), and its cameos by members of the original cast (Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison), only underscore that this new version isn&apos;t what the original was, i.e., an original.  Mark Wahlberg, as Our Hero, has none of the cynical, edgy complexity of Heston&apos;s Taylor, and is in fact the sort of can-do flyboy Taylor found laughable.  Much as I adore Helena Bonham Carter, her turn as Ari, a sultry, sexy, meddling, annoying human-rights activist, is ultimately tiresome, and absolutely incomparable to Kim Hunter&apos;s brave, brilliant, impish Zira of the old series.  The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter&apos;s beauty, hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human.  Rick Baker&apos;s highly-touted ape makeups (which I&apos;ve enjoyed since the days of &quot;Schlock&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;) are highly uneven here.  Tim Roth&apos;s villainous Thade has the best, with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers&apos; work in the original.  And the socko ending (keep reading; I won&apos;t spoil it for you) is simply tacked on: unlike the jolting end of the original, it neither ties together nor arises from the movie&apos;s earlier action in a way that Explains Everything.  Instead, it begs so many questions (mainly &quot;How the heck did THAT happen?&quot;) that it seems engineered (or contrived) solely to set the stage for more sequels.  All told, this is &quot;Apes Lite,&quot; a comic-bookish caricature of the original, made for the short-attention-span crowd.  It made me want to do something I hadn&apos;t done in ages: fire up the VCR and roll the original again.  It&apos;s typical of the 1968 movie&apos;s gritty, clever irony that the first word of dialogue uttered by an ape--his entire line, in fact--is &quot;Smile.&quot;"

However, it takes him some trial-and-error to understand this and when he does understand, he is too immature to handle the situation and runs for help. At that point, it is up to the people around him to guide him in the right or wrong direction - or is it? \n\nThat is the issue the movie is trying to resolve - what one should do to avoid being mislead by the others.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1999 (I think) things have gotten so bad that as a last resort, robots have been brought in to teach students. This is all thanks to Bob Forrest (Stacy Keach) who hopes that he can sell his robots to other problem ridden schools, however when the robots (John P. Ryan, Pam Grier and Patrick Kilpatrick) starting killing students for being late and start pitting gangs against each other, it&apos;s up to Cody (Bradley Gregg) to reunite the gangs and waste the &quot;George Jetson nightmare!&quot; Also the robots have killed his brothers and kidnapped his girlfriend Kristi (Traci Lin) so Cody&apos;s looking for revenge in this exciting and admittedly silly actioner. There are few genres that amuse me more than deadly teachers whipping bad kids in shape. The Principal, Substitute movies and so forth are sources of guilty pleasures, Class 99 is no different, since the androids are played by cool actors such as John P. Ryan, Pam Grier and Patrick Kilpatrick. The teenagers themselves don&apos;t really convince as punks but there is lots of action and it&apos;s all directed with the most possible gore, this was after all from Mark L. Lester (Commando and Showdown In Little Tokyo) so despite the obvious fact that this movie is even more poorly made than it&apos;s own sequel (Which stars Kickboxer 2&apos;s Sasha Mitchell) the fact is that this far more entertaining and is perfect for those who hate teenagers and want to see them get disposed of in the most grisly way. I for one find that to be great entertainment.\n\n3/5 Matt Bronson",

      "reviewBody": "Over the years, many writers as well as filmmakers discovered that seemly innocent and cherubic looking children make extra-creepy horror villains! Demonic kids almost form an entire sub genre of horror by themselves! There usually is an explanation for their abnormal and murderous behavior, though. Either it&apos;s the influence of a satanic cult (&quot;Children of the Corn&quot;), a nuclear meltdown (&quot;The Children of Ravensbeck&quot;), a temporary blackout caused by a comet (&quot;Village of the Damned&quot;) or even an ordinary solar eclipse on the day of their birth (&quot;Bloody Birthday&quot;). The youthful maniacs in this film have no real excuse for what they do. They were just born evil. And when their bus to the mental institute crashes down atop some snowy mountains, they become youthful maniacs AT LARGE! They make it to a holiday resort where some wannabe godfather Corleone runs his crime syndicate and they start killing all the residents. &quot;Devil Times Five&quot; is not a very good movie, but that&apos;s mainly due to a lack of budget and a shortage of talented cast &amp; crew members. There&apos;s very little going on in the first hour, apart from a spectacular bus crash and THE longest murder of an institute employee (filmed in slow-motion). When approaching the last third of the film, the creepy moments and gory murders begin to follow each other at fast pace and the atmosphere really gets morbid. The adults are all pitiful and uninteresting characters but the five kids have quite interesting backgrounds. The oldest girl pretends to be a young convent sister, another girl is obsessed with fire and the funny black kid constantly acts like he&apos;s in the army. Their incontrollable urge to slaughter unknown people is a bit difficult to believe at times, but overall these young actors do a terrific job. &quot;Devil Times Five&quot; is recommended 70&apos;s exploitation, with a fairly high cult-value and several unforgettable murder scenes (piranhas in the bathtub!!)",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Nomads&apos; is the debut feature from director John McTiernan, who would go on to bring us unforgettable films like &apos;Predator&apos;, &apos;Die Hard&apos;, and &apos;The Hunt for Red October&apos;. Honestly, I would lie if I were to tell you I know what &apos;Nomads&apos; is all about.\n\nThis is probably the type of film you have to carefully analyze to fully understand or appreciate. Although classified as a horror movie, it is not horror in the sense of blood, guts and gore. This is horror on a different level: discomfort, nightmares, visions...The film is interesting at times, but ultimately just too weird, and not all that easy to follow due to a most unusual narration.\n\nThe film plays like a nightmare - literally. The acting was pretty good, but didn&apos;t compensate for a very confusing script. The film certainly is mysterious, and very different. By the end, I had no idea what the story was, or what message they were trying to convey. I&apos;m going to forget this very soon. Even famed film critic Robert Ebert referred to the film as &quot;too confusing to understand&quot;.\n\nWould I watch it again? No.",

I guess we are expected to take your word on a movie instead of the Cannes Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival, which incidentally gave this move high praise. The film was an interesting, raw look at Jerusalem and Jordan as one would see it as a traveller. Plot has nothing to do with appreciating this movie, so I think you missed the mark. The story was used as a reason to explore the middle eastern culture. It was also interesting seeing Natalie Portman speak in her native Hebrew language. The film drew upon Portman&apos;s real life, as she was born in Isreal and had a Jewish father and American mother. Some films are watched for action, others for art, but I guess one will believe what one wants. There&apos;s my 2 cents.",

The backbone of it is a murder mystery but there are supernatural elements added to it, as well as a good bit of humor. The mystery part isn&apos;t the greatest. I figured out who the killer was immediately with little effort. I can only imagine most other viewers will, as well. But the other stuff with the horns and the way they make people act provides for some nice dark comedy. I was impressed with Daniel Radcliffe, although he needs to keep working on his accent. His pronunciation is a little too pointed at times. Juno Temple is always great to watch. Wish she was in this more. The rest of the cast is solid. Nice to see Heather Graham in a small but fun role. It&apos;s a good movie. It&apos;s not without flaws but it is pretty original and not pretentious, which is a rarity these days. Goes on a little longer than necessary but I was never bored. I liked the ending, too.",

      "reviewBody": "The premise is good, the actors excellent and the music score well chosen. It is a really hard try to achieve something really sympathetic. So why does it fail on most levels? The main blame must lie with the script. First, it is not funny! And with a romantic comedy that must be close to a deadly sin. There are a few chuckles, but otherwise nothing. Secondly, the characters are rather badly drawn. I have no doubt that they are meant to be extremely interesting, but their behaviour are absurd most of the time because we never really get to know them properly. We are thrown into the plot head first without any background to who they are and what makes them tick. Like a previous reviewer wrote, this film is filled with supporting characters, including the main protagonists! The female doctor is the only REAL person who manages to make a REAL impression, but she only has about a minute of screen time. As to the actors, they really try, but I am not convinced that they agree which kind of movie they are in. Charlotte Munch seems to think this is some kind of serious relationship drama and responds accordingly, looking troubled in almost every scene. Mikkelsen and Lyby have no chemistry whatsoever together and one wonders what they saw in each other in the first place. The usually excellent Mikkelsen seems unhappy about the whole thing and manages to look bored with BOTH his man and his woman. Lyby is the one actor who comes off the best. He is the most sympathetic in this &quot;comedy&quot; and responds to his plight with some kind of normal reaction. He is sweet guy with a whole lot of emotions and also some sense of humour who really deserves someone better and more focused than the guy Mikkelsen portrays. Other than that we get a gallery of more or less eccentric people who bend over backwards to get a laugh from the audience, but fail at every turn. And then there is the ending!!!! Pleeeease, take it away!! I suppose it&apos;s meant to be heartwarming but it only comes across as phony and ridiculous. But it is not hard going despite all my reservations. You can watch it if there is nothing else to do, it will cause you no pain...but nor will it stay in the memory for longer than one minute or so! Loved the score though...",

The movie totally belongs to Jr.NTR. His screen presence, voice modulation and dances are a treat to watch on big screen. The intense gaze coupled with some quirky punch dialogues in the early parts of the film give a distinct tone to Narasimha&apos;s role. On the other hand, Jr.NTR is chirpy, talkative, slapstick and innocent characterization as Narasimha Chari will definitely bring a smile on to your face. His dances took away the breath of audiences. Especially his steps in &apos;pilla na valla kaadu&apos; received once-mores in theaters. Nayantara is slim and sleek while Sheela looted young hearts with glowing skin and sensuous garments. Nothing more is left for heroines than this to discuss.Brahmanandam is awesome as Bhattu. He is one of the pillar to the movie. Even if you see many number of times you can&apos;t stop laughing .\n\nFinally Single line is &quot; Watch it for NTR&apos;s dances and his hilarious Brahminic performance and it&apos;s definitely watchable movie&quot; .",

      "reviewBody": "After Lee Marvin won his Oscar for Cat Ballou and had great critical and popular success also with Ship of Fools and The Dirty Dozen, this former two part television episode from the Kraft Suspense Theater was edited together for release as a feature film. Sergeant Ryker casts Lee Marvin in the role of a soldier who was convicted of treason during the Korean War and sentenced to hang.\n\nSergeant Ryker could have been a whole lot better though. It has the look and feel of a made for television film, but more important than that, the editing probably left a lot out.\n\nWe come into the story with Bradford Dillman who has just successfully prosecuted Marvin now having doubts about what he did. The military more than most organizations does not like to admit mistakes and Dillman&apos;s doubts are raising all kinds of problems for him and for the United States Army.\n\nDillman has other problems as well, he&apos;s falling for Marvin&apos;s wife Vera Miles and she him. Still he persists in the quest and does get Marvin a new trial, courtesy of General Lloyd Nolan.\n\nMarvin says he was given a confidential assignment to defect and gather intelligence. Problem is that the officer who allegedly gave him that assignment was killed and no record of it was found.\n\nThe trial takes an interesting turn and Dillman does a skillful job for his client. Yet the end of the movie will leave the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nLook also for good performances from Norman Fell as the sergeant who gives Dillman some key evidence, Murray Hamilton as Dillman&apos;s good drinking buddy and prosecutor Peter Graves.",

This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There&apos;s also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve read some of the reviews for this movie, and I can&apos;t agree with them. I completely disagree in that I thought this was a very entertaining movie. The concept was very well thought out but it wasn&apos;t perfect, obviously.\n\nBasically, the movie was about several groups of assassins all gunning for the same man for the same price. The reason he is wanted dead is because of his snitching and deceitful ways. I&apos;m not going to give anything away, but once you watch the movie you&apos;ll know there&apos;s a lot more behind that. Only thing you really need to do is pay as close attention as you can during the beginning, because it does get a little confusing. The story moves along pretty quickly, but you will get the gist of it.\n\nOverall, I thought it was very well done. The plot was good, the characters were amazing (especially Ryan Reynolds), and there were some nice action parts. Even though it dragged on a little bit during the middle, it was necessary to develop plot details. 9 out of 10 stars from me; it was very entertaining and thought provoking. Last but not least, the white karate kid in the trailer was hilarious, &quot;Why you eye-ballin&apos; me son!?&quot;.",

It can be a struggle as I only know the colourful 1961 motion picture, with that mighty Bernard Herrmann music playing over it, so getting that out of my mind was hard. But anyway, the review...\n\nThis is not too bad at all, if you have no problem with watching men walk, walk and run, run around an island. We get a lot of that. But famed 60s science fiction TV producer - Irwin Allen - rooted a lot of his work (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Time Tunnel, Land Of The Giants, etc) on serials and you can just picture Allen watching Mysterious Island (1951) and taking notes.\n\nHidden caves with aliens inside, an erupting volcano, almost zero characterisation, grim faced determination, over-the-top alien costumes, pinching music cues from other studio productions (in this case Columbia&apos;s Batman and Robin), etc. It is all here and a lot turned up in Irwin Allen TV as well.\n\nIf you have no interest in the Allen connection, I would still tune in anyway, but don&apos;t even think about watching the whole four or five hours in one viewing. After one hour I needed a 24 hour rest from it. I would suggest one hour a night."

      "reviewBody": "Tough as nails, no holds barred skater girls take on the challenge of traveling competition to competition with no expectation of success. In a world where males rule in extreme sports, these girls push the limits to play at their level if not above.\n\nThe story starts with the girls packed in a small hippie van with gear in tow driving from place to place racking up points, awards, and respect in their sport. With Dave acting as big brother, father, and coach the girls slowly open up and become goofy group of pranksters. However the competition does not come just between them and other girls they come across on tour. There is no denying there is some heat amongst the clan. \n\nThe journey of these young women worked its way into my heart enough to write this review, because I have always tried to make it in &quot;guy sports&quot; but was pushed back or down on every turn, and to see young women succeeding and going places not many have gives me hope for the future of the sport. AKA: Girl Skater is a brilliant documentary, and I only hope more people discover the heart of this film. This documentary takes you into the minds, hearts, and struggles of these young women as they fight to create a blip on the radar. Even though by the story&apos;s end they were still not heard in the way they would like, there is no way that these young women will be stopping anytime soon, and the age of women&apos;s extreme sports is surely yet to come."

He breaks-out and along with hunchback Daniel (J.Carroll Naish) take the ¨chamber of horrors showside¨ of Professor Lampini (George Zucco) containing the skeleton of count Dracula (John Carradine) . They are going to Frankenstein&apos;s village and later they return to Vesaria . His aim is taking the experiments on life of the deceased Henry Frankestein found into archives of the castle . The doctor tries some scientific experiments to cure various Universal monsters but results that their bad habits emerge again . The second half has them dealing with the werewolf called Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) and monster Frankenstein (Glen Strange in his first appearance as monster) . Meanwhile , the hunchback falls in love with a Zingara (Elena Verdugo) and developing a loving triangle with the werewolf , the beast marked for the pentagram .\n\nThe classic player of horror movies Boris Karloff is magnificent and his strong portrayal of the scientific attempting to create a new monster changing brains is awesome . Filmmaker Erl C. Kenton creates some really chilling scenes, with amazing moments , and several powerful images, especially when the creatures are reborn , including an interesting and twisted script . ¨Frankenstein¨and ¨The bride of Frankenstein¨ by James Whale were the definitive expressionist Gothic Horror movies that set the mold for successive terror movies just like this ¨House of Frankentein¨and many others . Atmospheric , slick terror film , creaky at times but it&apos;s still impressive . Film displays excellent set design , ambitious screenplay with too many monsters and enjoyable and sensitive interpretation of all casting . Lon Chaney Jr.&apos;s top-notch acting in the role which made him a terror movie legend . J Carroll Naish is excellent as a hunchback similar to Igor . The movie is also called ¨The Zingara and the monsters¨, as the title suggests , various of Universal&apos;s most famous monsters confront and fight each other . Creepy and adjusted music by Hans J. Salter and eerie black and white cinematography , filled with lights and shades . The motion picture was well directed Erle C. Kenton who already directed various horror films . The prequel was ¨Frankestein meet the wolf man¨ and was followed by a sequel : ¨House of Dracula¨.",

      "reviewBody": "Una lunga fila di croci (AKA: No Room to Die/A Noose for Django/Hanging for Django) is directed by Sergio Garrone and features music by Vasco and Mancuso, with cinematography by Franco Villa. It stars Anthony Steffen, William Berger, Nicoletta Machiavelli, Mario Brega and Riccardo Garrone. \n\nMexican&apos;s are being smuggled over the border to work as cheap labour for wealthy land baron Fargo (Garrone). Fargo&apos;s gang is made up of known criminals with bounties on their heads, this greatly interests two bounty hunters, Brandon (Steffen) and Murdock (Berger), who may have to team up to achieve their goals and stay ahead of the game? \n\nOn plot terms it&apos;s simplicity 101, a couple of cool dudes are waging a war against the evil and wealthy town boss and his gang. In true Spaghetti Western style a lot of blood is shed, there&apos;s plenty of scowling from scuzzy men and pouting from the lead babe. A twist is thrown in for good measure, and on an action quota basis this never lacks in that department. In fact I think there might be more gunplay than actual dialogue! \n\nIt&apos;s what I would call a safe Spaghetti Western, a chance to make a telling political point is wasted, but there&apos;s a lot of style around to ensure that the pic is never once dull. Garrone (Django the Bastard) knows his Spaghetti and indulges in the staples of the genre, with canted angles, revolving frames, whippy pans, zooms in and out, up-tilts and fight scenes that literally come through the camera. Add in Berger&apos;s 7 barrelled shotgun with its endless supply of bullets, a schizophrenic musical score, the gorgeous Machiavelli getting a female role of some substance, and it&apos;s all good really. \n\nNot top tier Spaghetti, and it is hardly original, but it keeps the plate warm with bullets and punches galore. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the movie being as mid-90s as it is, the craft still surprisingly holds up really well today. Of course the main reason being just how well written and relatable our 4 lead characters are. They all come from backgrounds and struggles we all can relate to one way or another. Rather it being broken families, body self-consciousness, or even being bullied for racism. They have incredible chemistry together &amp; can&apos;t deny you want to be part of this group. The Witchcraft element is played out very believable &amp; we cheer to see our leads get their happiness. But as we all know sometimes great power can fall in the wrong hands. Cannot think of a better cast from that time period to play these roles. Robin Tunney, a pre-scream Neve Campbell, Rachel True, and of course Fairuza Balk&apos;s now iconic performance as the raunchy, sinister, &amp; gorgeous Nancy Downs.\n\nMy only issue with the film is a couple of weak moments with character choices. First is the whole love spell storyline with Sarah and this bully named Chris. It doesn&apos;t seem clear if she actually really liked him or just wanted to play him for what he did. Also later in the film it doesn&apos;t make sense why two of the girls side with Nancy to attack Sarah. They even try to apologize at the end like nearly killing her was just a joke or something.\n\nDespite those flaws the craft is an excellent time. Give it a watch and join the cult weirdo.",

These two collide (comically) with each other in a complicated  scheme orchestrated by rebellious military and civillians where they are used as a &quot;distraction&quot; from the real mission. Ackroyd&apos;s leadership enables them to survive to complete their mission while the lascivious Chase spends most of his time thinking like the typical male. When they find a Soviet mobile missile launcher and then receive instructions from their rebellious controllers to &quot;accidently&quot; send the thing on it&apos;s way to a target in the US, only the quick thinking of Ackroyd can save the day. This movie has some great comic elements as well as good action scenes with decent stunts. Chevy Chase never fails to entertain with his suave, intelligent(he only acts stupid) and sexy character he made famous in other roles. Dan Ackroyd is GREAT as the straight man who keeps Chevy out of trouble. Add this one to your collection of DVD movies in the comedy section on your shelf!"

      "reviewBody": "I also love this film.\n\nIt&apos;s a wonderful, intense, realistic and insightful look at the Spanish Civil War with the highly naturalistic cinematography and committed performances characteristic of Loach.\n\nThe reviews and debate concentrate on the action in Spain, which, for me, is only half the story that Loach is telling. I grew up in Liverpool in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s and knew quite a few David Carrs. Men then in their own fifties and sixties, often alone, keeping themselves to themselves in quiet corners of pubs and working men&apos;s clubs. They never told their own stories, never wanted credit, never wanted to relive their experiences in the Battle of the Atlantic, on the Baltic convoys, in North Africa. Someone who knew them would sometimes say &quot;he was torpedoed four times&quot; or &quot;he was two years in Spain fighting Franco&quot; and that would be that.\n\nSo I am delighted that David Carr, played by the incomparable Ian Hart, and this movie is such a fabulous testament to all of them. I love the way his life expands onto the screen, from the small remainder in a Liverpool council flat, from the letters uncovered by his death, into the light and air of Spain, enabling us to share in his buried idealism, its betrayal, then to witness the love of his life and the loss of it. Incredibly beautiful and truly heartbreaking. Unsuspected by all but his best mates and his newly enlightened granddaughter, David is surely off to Valhalla to be reunited with Blanca and his warrior friends of the past. I cannot think of anything in film so unsentimental yet so poignantly moving as her last salute.\n\nThis isn&apos;t Don Quixote, though. Nor is it Orwell, who is magnificent in an entirely different way, nor is it Hemingway&apos;s brash heroism or Saving Private Ryan&apos;s gung-ho bullet-for-bullet style of &quot;historical verisimilitude&quot;. \n\nIt doesn&apos;t matter at all whether the events are being portrayed with strict accuracy or not. This is the authentic texture of twentieth century history in perfect context, portrayed through the lens of one man&apos;s experience.\n\nAnd there is hardly anything else like it on film.\n\nA true masterpiece of the art which deserves a much bigger reputation and a place in the British Movie Pantheon alongside the very best."

      "reviewBody": "A surprisingly funny movie about a group of geeks who set off on a mission to break into Skywalker Ranch and view a print of the as-yet-unreleased latest installment in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot; \n\nThis is a road trip comedy of the fairly standard variety, with trips to jail and Vegas, some drug use, some Internet hookups and some prostitutes thrown in for good measure. The film looks like it was made for about $20 and certainly doesn&apos;t break any new ground. But the cast of actors is game and look like they&apos;re having a ball -- there&apos;s an especially hilarious sequence that features Seth Rogen in disguise as leader of an army of rival Trekkies. I can&apos;t really imagine anyone who doesn&apos;t have a pretty thorough knowledge of &quot;Star Wars&quot; trivia enjoying this film, because virtually every shot and line includes some sort of reference to the George Lucas series. But since I&apos;m a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, I thought it was a hoot.\n\nGrade: A",

DeCarmine spends his life savings on an extravagant overcoat for the winter. It is stolen and he eventually catches a deadly cold from not having it. Eventually, however, DeCarmine does get his due.

Rather,it deals with the coming of life anew for Matthau when he takes a profound interest in the very pregnant babysitter for his grandson. What an interesting idea and it is so well developed.\n\nDeborah Winters gives a fantastic supporting performance as the pregnant girl,orphaned, raised by an uncaring brother who finds meaning in her life when she aided by Kotch.\n\nThere is a totally winning song dealing with what you do with your life.\n\nThis film was definitely an under-rated gem.

Puts the lie to the &quot;Official Story,&quot; which has changed in every major facet a multitude of times, so it must be spoken of in the plural. American Coup retrieves from the memory hole the many eyewitness testimonies which contradict the official lies.\n\nContrary to the nonsense about how many people would have to be involved to cover up the truth the film explains how compartmentalization is used in black ops. Facts are what matter and the facts can not be explained away by denying it would be impossible for such a coup could take place. It did take place contrary to misinformation from the accessories after the fact in the corporate media.\n\nThe movie points out that the Vietnam war was started by a lie. Ignorance is no excuse to deny the overwhelming evidence of government complicity in 9/11. Core of Corruption and Zero should be companion pieces as they dissect the many &quot;coincidences&quot; that cant be ignored by unfurling the shadow governments favorite phrase to pretend it&apos;s crimes didn&apos;t happen, &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Blood Diamond&quot; is the kind of action film that makes you think that &apos;a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...&apos; \n\nThe film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fieldsAccording to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil war \n\nDanny Archercrazy for diamonds like everybody elsebelieves this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent He is a smuggler, a former mercenary and weapons trader from Zimbabwe who bribes all, and supplies arms to both sides He gets Solomon Vandycaptured by government troopsout of jail only because he overhears that the fisherman might have found a clear massive stone about the size of a bird&apos;s egg \n\nVandyforced apart from his family and sent off to work as a slave in the minefieldshas hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle His son Dia is taking away by a brainwashing militia called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) turning him with lies, drugs, and liquor, into a cold-blooded murderer\n\nDanny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond The majority of the story is their journey across the war torn country \n\nLeonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade On his trek to find the stone, Archer&apos;s eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self-profit \n\nDjimon Hounsou eventually realizes that Danny&apos;s connections and money are his only hope He plays a helpless character totally passionate as the resolving and fiercely determined father desperate to learn the fate of his family\n\nConnelly is an idealist who wishes to display corruption She thinks that with Archer&apos;s help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover-up behind the diamond trade \n\nIt is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond He&apos;s a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen&apos;s most efficient scene-stealer \n\nNominated for five Oscars, &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; is an action, political adventure at its best!",

      "reviewBody": "While it happily avoids current Hollywood story formula, this astonishing film is well served by the Withdrawal-Devastation-Return structure that it inherits from Mediterranean oral epic. Yet it was not the film&apos;s durable structure that mesmerized me and the rest of its first American audience Friday night at the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival. What astonished me was the extraordinary moral depth of this achingly beautiful story and world from Writer/Director Christian Duguay. His film is emotionally riveting from the first scene to the last.\n\nThe movie is well grounded in the quintessential motive of cinematic, horse-themed stories: emotional honesty as the basis for meaningful relationships, despite, in the last scenes of the film, some surprising chicanery that illustrates the value of those goods internal to an activity or calling over those that are external to any one life or practice, like money and fame. The film makes us believe in and care about its characters, and ultimately, and entirely in its subtext, the film does something even more extraordinary: it exhibits and extolls the virtues themselves. The story itself retains all the uncertainties of our contingent, vulnerable existence, but the implicit argument of the story is emotionally compelling and inexorable. Ride Above is a charming, heartbreaking, beautiful exercise of a viewer&apos;s own imagination and sympathies. This reviewer feels he became, somehow, a little better as a human being for having seen it.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie had a very &quot;classic movie&quot; motif, mostly taking place amongst nature. The plot of the movie is really interesting and is semi- predicable/unpredictable. However, if you don&apos;t speak German, then you will probably not understand it at all. This film is very typical of a &quot;heimatfilm&quot; taking place in usually Bavaria/Austria. It&apos;s very easy to tell that some of the actors and actresses are from that area because of their accents and word usage, while some are clearly native &quot;hochdeutsch&quot; speakers. The film is so delightful with a wonderful love story full of Bavarian culture amongst the beautiful alps. Also there&apos;s quite a bit of yodeling, which who doesn&apos;t love yodeling? :P",

Of course the plot is manipulated to make time for a couple of songs, including Cole Porter&apos;s &quot;Night and Day,&quot; when she has to pretend she&apos;s a night club singer during her investigation.\n\nThe film begins while her train is pulling into New York, and during a brief pause before continuing to Grand Central Station it pauses long enough for her to see a murder being committed in a warehouse window across the tracks. Naturally since she&apos;s been reading a murder mystery, so nobody believes she saw a real murder, so she tries to enlist the author of her book to help her solve the crime. Somehow she stumbles into the reading of the will for the dead man and is mistaken for his nightclub mistress, who is the sole heir. It&apos;s too bad Durbin did not continue her career, as she does a great job playing an adult role with a winning blend of comedy, drama, romance and still a bit of music.",

This shift in focus was occasioned by the hiring of stuntman-turned-director Stanley Tong (RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, CHINA STRIKE FORCE, etc.), who keeps a tight rein on the film&apos;s narrative excesses whilst indulging some of the most spectacular action set-pieces ever filmed, *anywhere*.\n\nNothing in the first half of the movie - Chan&apos;s fight with gymnastic beauty Sam Wong at a mainland police training center; his initiation into Tsang&apos;s criminal gang by helping the villain&apos;s brother (Yuen Wah) escape from a prison work camp; a battle with police in a crowded marketplace, etc. - can prepare viewers for the *astonishing* climactic confrontation between Good and Evil, involving a series of hair-raising car stunts, Chan dangling (apparently unassisted) from a rope-ladder beneath a helicopter as it swings *high* above the streets of Kuala Lumpur (!), and the final hand-to-hand battle on top of a speeding train, upon which the aforementioned helicopter has become precariously entangled - and not a CGI shot in sight! Filmed with breathtaking gusto by artists working at the top of their game, this is commercial cinema at its most astounding (check the outtakes during the final credits, in which various participants come perilously close to serious injury or *death* during filming!).\n\nMaggie Cheung makes another extended cameo appearance as Chan&apos;s beleaguered girlfriend, though the film is stolen clean away by Michelle Yeoh (billed as &apos;Michelle Khan&apos; in some prints) as a mainland policewoman who assists Chan in his undercover operation, and who proves to be Chan&apos;s equal during the fast and furious combat sequences (the character proved popular enough to warrant her own spin-off feature, PROJECT S, in 1993!). Easily the best of the &quot;Police Story&quot; series to date, and one of the most memorable efforts to emerge from HK in the last fifty years, POLICE STORY III - SUPER COP is a winner. Followed by FIRST STRIKE (1996).\n\nAs usual, the movie was re-edited and rescored for its 1996 US debut under the title SUPERCOP. That version is missing only a few minutes of material, but should be avoided nonetheless.\n\n(Cantonese and Mandarin dialogue)",

      "reviewBody": "I assumed this would be another run-of-the-mill Christmas movie. It has a slightly darker feel so I sort of found the uptempo festive music slightly at odds - but it comes together in the end. There is a bit of light relief in the salon - which also feels disconnected but ties in eventually. The salon slightly reminds me of Runaway Bride so I have expected Erin Cahill to come in and make a platypus face, but alas no. Ultimately this is still a feel-good movie and in some ways the bitterness makes it sweeter. Also, the end credits are quite quirky and definitely unique to this movie - raises the festive nature after the struggles.",

This movie had all ingredients of being a family drama but poor publicity and poor release went against the movie. In fact the movie is not available on CD/DVD in India and is rarely shown in one of the channels. Rajesh Khanna has done his part of the role well but has not been supported by proper direction and editing. The music by R D Burman is routine too. It is a must see for Rajesh Khanna fans as he is playing the title role and has done his part well. The movie is all about brothers in a village and with Rajesh as the head of the family and about his sacrifices. If one gets an opportunity- one must see this family drama.",

And the children infront of the camera say more than any adult could, as is always the way. Unfortunatly the director spends a little too much time explaining himself at the begining, talking about what kind of film he might or might not make in a slightly pretentious way. And the continual cutting from child to camera man (the director himself, looking directorly) doesn&apos;t quite work. But when the children are left to just get on with it the film flows along nicely. A useful insight into Iran, a country that, despite the recent wave of movies, remains shamefully unknown to the average European or American."

      "name": "A High-Octane Masala Entertainer",
      "reviewBody": "R... Rajkumar, directed by Prabhu Deva, is a quintessential Bollywood masala film that combines high-energy action, romance, and comedy. Released in 2013, the movie features Shahid Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha in lead roles, with Sonu Sood playing the antagonist. While the film delivers on the entertainment front with its over-the-top action sequences and catchy music, it falls short in terms of story depth and character development.\n\nPlot Summary The story follows Romeo Rajkumar (Shahid Kapoor), a carefree and brash young man who arrives in the small town of Dhartipur, ruled by two warring drug lords, Shivraj (Sonu Sood) and Parmar (Ashish Vidyarthi). Rajkumar falls in love at first sight with the beautiful Chanda (Sonakshi Sinha), who turns out to be Parmar&apos;s niece. Determined to win her love, Rajkumar finds himself embroiled in the deadly conflict between Shivraj and Parmar. The plot thickens as Rajkumar challenges Shivraj and sets out to protect Chanda, leading to a series of explosive confrontations.\n\nPerformances Shahid Kapoor shines as the titular Rajkumar, bringing a blend of charm, swagger, and intensity to his role. His dance skills, showcased in the film&apos;s energetic song sequences, and his adeptness at performing high-octane stunts make him a compelling action hero. Despite the film&apos;s flaws, Kapoor&apos;s performance is a highlight.\n\nSonakshi Sinha as Chanda delivers a spirited performance, though her character is often limited to the role of a damsel in distress. Sinha manages to bring a certain strength and feistiness to her character, which is refreshing.\n\nSonu Sood as the antagonist Shivraj is menacing and charismatic. His portrayal of the ruthless drug lord is convincing, and he brings a sense of gravitas to the film. The supporting cast, including Ashish Vidyarthi and Mukul Dev, provide adequate support, though their roles are largely one-dimensional.\n\nDirection and Cinematography Prabhu Deva&apos;s direction is marked by his signature style, blending fast-paced action with vibrant dance numbers and comedic elements. The film&apos;s pacing is brisk, and the action sequences are choreographed with flair and executed with precision. However, the narrative is often predictable and formulaic, relying heavily on familiar tropes and clichés.\n\nThe cinematography by Mohana Krishna captures the rustic and gritty atmosphere of Dhartipur effectively. The action scenes are visually dynamic, and the song sequences are colorful and vibrant, adding to the film&apos;s overall appeal.\n\nMusic and Background Score The music of R... Rajkumar, composed by Pritam, is one of the film&apos;s strong points. Songs like &quot;Gandi Baat,&quot; &quot;Saree Ke Fall Sa,&quot; and &quot;Mat Maari&quot; are catchy and well-choreographed, showcasing Shahid Kapoor&apos;s impressive dance moves. The background score by Sandeep Chowta enhances the film&apos;s action and dramatic moments, though it tends to be a bit overbearing at times.\n\nThemes and Impact R... Rajkumar explores themes of love, loyalty, and revenge within the framework of a typical Bollywood masala entertainer. The film&apos;s primary focus is on delivering entertainment through its action, music, and comedy, rather than delving into deeper thematic content or character development.\n\nConclusion R... Rajkumar is a film that knows its audience and delivers exactly what it promises: a high-energy, entertaining ride filled with action, comedy, and romance. While it may not offer much in terms of originality or depth, it succeeds in providing a fun and engaging viewing experience for fans of the masala genre.\n\nFor those looking for a light-hearted, action-packed entertainer with catchy music and charismatic performances, R... Rajkumar fits the bill. However, viewers seeking a more nuanced and substantial narrative may find the film lacking in those aspects.",

What everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners &quot;do ya like dags?&quot; etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works. I would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder, this film demands all your attention! Look past the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film.\n\nYes this has its influences from modern classics( fight club, pulp fiction etc ) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none. I feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that Ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney &quot;masterpieces&quot;.",

It can&apos;t be too bad?&quot; Yet, I was surprised, the movie does follow a generic plotline if you ask me, but the humor in this movie landed well with me. Which kind of surprised me, because I usually don&apos;t like the humor in movies like this. The actress playing Nefer was also a surprisingly good singer. Better than I was expecting from someone who doesn&apos;t really show up on mything on IMDb. I&apos;d like to see/hear more of her. The 3rd act did somehow surprise me.\n\nTo concluse this review: it&apos;s a generic movie with CGI animation that cut corners in a few places(if you see them, you WILL notice it), but overall, it&apos;s a decent watch. Not too bad to put on for the kids and who knows, you might even like it yourself?",

It was a great story line. I think that the movie was under rated. The writer should have gotten special notice. Last but not least, when I first saw this movie I was 13 and my male hormones went nuts over the assistant who showed off her butt. The movie had a great atmosphere that I wish modern day movie directors would take notice of. There was no slash, no gore and no bad language. Instead of showing all the blood and guts of todays horror movies, they should take notice of movies like this.",

But you owe it to yourself to see one of the worst movies ever. It was not made-for-TV, but a real, live in the theatre experience. People might have actually spent real cash to see this. Sad.  The LeMat (pistol) actually existed as a .22 cal,with a .410 shotgun barrel, but was not introduced until the Civil War. A great many men carried Bowie knives at the time that this took place, but I imagine getting an actual Samurai katana would have been very difficult."

      "reviewBody": "One of the great joys of being a movie addict is loving unreasonably. There&apos;s probably no rational way to convey my adoration for this 1971 Ivan Passer movie, which was made for nothing back in the day when movies like this actually could get made and released--today, it&apos;d be shot on digital video in someone&apos;s basement and never see the light of day. George Segal gives one of the performances of his career as J, a hairdresser turned heroin addict who vamps his way through the day with a torrent of improvised Lenny Bruce hipsterisms. Karen Black is the &quot;straight,&quot; broken girl who falls in love with him for no good reason except that he&apos;s broken too--I can&apos;t think of a more haunting moment in a movie romance than the one where she drops him off in midtown Manhattan to score dope and implores, &quot;J--remember to come back home.&quot; The movie fleetly conveys the romance, the soft-edgedness and wombiness of heroin--and then in short order takes you all the way down to the bitterest consequences. And it reminds you of the beauties of hard-knuckle, dirty-formica naturalism--pleasures unavailable to more stylized or more conceptual pictures. Has there ever been an actress as free as Karen Black? The way she lifts up ten fingers, over and over again, to count off the number of men she&apos;s slept with; or the strange little hair-bite she does when she oaths her love to Segal on the beach--everything is as fresh and unaffected and right as if it were playing out in your living room right this minute. The locations, the smoky, salty, funereal-blues soundtrack--Ivan Passer can&apos;t put a foot wrong in this movie. Why is this guy not being given all the work in the world? And why is this movie not acclaimed a masterpiece in a world where rusty chestnuts by Rafelson and Bogdanovich are still held in high esteem?"

One of the funniest things in the film is the fact that every male in Turkey is seen to be sporting a moustache! Otherwise, the concoction is the same as before: tough hero (heroes in this case), above-the-law financiers discussing their criminal business around a dinner table, their vicious thugs and abused molls, kidnappings, fisticuffs, shoot-outs, a bit of gratuitous nudity, bad disco soundtrack, etc.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In a Day&quot; is a character drama disguised as a romantic comedy. The poster, reviews and other advertisements market this film as a romantic comedy. That&apos;s the easy way out as there is more to it.\n\nOur heroine is Ashley, a struggling musician working at a sandwich café. When she has a bad day, a generous stranger Michael is there to sweep her off her feet and fill her with indulgences and confessions. It certainly sounds like a romantic comedy but instead of playing it out with comedy and romance, we get character development. We slowly learn more about Michael and Ashley, their past and what they want out of life.\n\nIt&apos;s not dark or menacing but it&apos;s also not light weight. It has a message; the film-makers have something they want to say. I&apos;m not entirely sure I agree, but I appreciate their venture. &quot;In a Day&quot; took similar avenues that &quot;You Again&quot; (2010) tried, but this film did it with so much more intelligence that I had to knock &quot;You Again&quot; down a star.\n\nIf you like indie films with a message and heart, then I recommend &quot;In a Day&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Another good film by Truffaut (as with DW Griffith, Leni Riefenstahl) in the sense of a good watch, but why does it seem so gloomy and weighted down--at times even like a horror film. \n\nIs it because Bertrand Morane is a solitary? Or because he draws us into a world (through his low key, partly sympathetic rendering) that is somehow upsetting and/or even detestable? Is it because the view here is hothouse psychological? A kind of Freudian mind drama in which a mother-son dyad subsumes everything outside itself to its own ends? (see &quot;Alfie&quot; for a social view of a similar womanizer) Is it because of the extent to which this fantasy is carried out---that it finally seems deranged, and sick, as if the product of a puerile mind in an adult? Or is it all the concealment techniques used to paint Bertrand as so exceptional a male that he might even find acceptance on an all-female island?\n\nI think all of the above count but for my part the real source of gloom is the absence of women in &quot;The Man Who Loved Women.&quot; No matter the angle, the multiplicity of women (one arguable exception) are singularly available to Bertrand Morane. They are inspected (their entry into his world and our screens), pursued, consumed, and disposed of--all to their immense delight. This is their invisibility Oh yeah, they have their fleeting stories, but these are invariably subsumed by Bertrand&apos;s script, which is all about pleasure, appetite, and some trumped up memory of a delinquent promiscuous mother. \n\nBut the big lie in all this and what Bertrand is most convinced of is that women want and need sex--and specifically from him. This availability is so patently confirmed as to be pornographic. Each step of his lovers&apos; butterfly-like life span with him is not only accepted, but savored and yearned for. It&apos;s as if his sexualizing puppy-love has incapacitated them, cutting them off from both their own minds, and their own worlds. No way they&apos;re drawn to him for social reasons (this is not &quot;Alfie&quot;)---but an irressistable urge which speaks for the social power (cleverly hidden by Truffaut) behind his very personal power trip. And accounts for Bertrand&apos;s capacity to transform live, often tall, world-aware women into fun sex toys.\n\nThe real convincer in this schema of availability, though, is Genevieve, the editor publisher. You expect her to be the point woman for exposure, given her position and her inside view of Bertrand&apos;s story, but no--she is the ultimate patsy. She not only loves his refreshingly honest take on his use of women---which she convinces herself is so modern, and contains a tendency toward equality, but converts five resistant male co-publishers to her view. Which makes it just a matter of time--she&apos;s lucky to be leggy-- before she expresses wimpish longings for the said Bertrand Morane and jumps into bed with him. And her love, like that of all his others, will soon become eternal and confer a kind of sainthood on the late Bertrand. If this seems astonishing than her role in the burial scene confirms it to be nakedly true. Surrounded by dozens of Saint Bertrand&apos;s lovers, she supplies the voice over as each woman approaches to toss dirt on his coffin. She touts each as an example of Bertrand&apos;s diverse taste for women... like shy, myopic, gentle, passionate, orphanish, funny, and so forth, ad nauseam as if even greater holiness might be bestowed on a male who has slept with Asians, Blacks, Latinas, Russians, and Native Islanders. Anyway, a &quot;fitting&quot; end indeed to a man who classified all women as either &quot;kittens&quot; or &quot;fillies.&quot;",

It entertains me by taking me through a wide gamut of emotions, it stimulates me spiritually and philosophically (indian faith, western existentialism are all there) and it is technically brilliant.\n\nEach scene seems to be individually composed and you can see the effort that director vijay anand and his crew put in. Raju speaks to us in one of the scenes &quot;there is not much difference between me and you&quot;. And as he speaks this you see the statue of Krishna in the background and Raju&apos;s index finger stretched as if holding a sudarshan chakra. Brilliant!!! Subtle things like these that you have to watch out for. The name &quot;Guide&quot; itself conveys a different meaning at different times in the movie; a railway guide, a personal guide and then a spiritual guide. \n\nIt is very sad that a brilliant director like Vijay Anand could never come out of the shadows of Navketan and despite giving us some of the most important and influential movies of our times was ignored. People in west respect their classics and make an effort that Billy Wilder, Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Chaplin etc. are not forgotten. New directors openly admit how much they have been influenced by these people. But in India, what is not on MTV is not worth remembering. In another 10 years no one will remember Vijay Anand.",

      "reviewBody": "A rather contemptible recreation of events in the disturbing life of John Lennon&apos;s killer, Mark David Chapman. As portrayed by Jared Leto (a disciplined, dedicated actor who gained some 60 pounds for the role), Chapman is a suicidal, overweight ex-student from Georgia by way of Texas who believed himself to be the embodiment of Holden Caulfield, the anti-hero celebrated by J. D. Salinger in his book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. By killing a celebrity, Chapman felt he would finally gain all the attention he&apos;d been deprived of in life. Leto plays him as a schizophrenic drifter with a short fuse, a man so alienated from the real world that he puts down the rich and famous for being phony without ever realizing his own deluded behavior. Without a doubt, extremely queasy and disturbing material, yet the film isn&apos;t particularly enlightening or incisive on any level. Writer-director J.P. Schaefer stages the entire picture as a build-up to Chapman&apos;s final release of fury, sort of like &apos;the ultimate event&apos;. We get nothing in the wake of the senseless killing except actual news footage from December 1980 (with pictures of the real John Lennon held up by the crowds). Schaefer exploits the grief in these archival clips simply to cap his own movie off, while the actor playing Lennon (briefly glimpsed) is named Mark Lindsay Chapman... Is nothing sacred for filmmakers anymore? The melodrama on display here is meant to squeeze and prod us, and to keep us in suspense, but the sensationalistic tactics come through loudly and cheaply. *1/2 from ****",

The first time I saw &quot;Strange Days&quot; was about five years ago, and then over and over again. If you think Ralph Fiennes is only able to play sensitive and problematic characters watch this: it´s his most unusual, but one of the best performances in his career - a performance of a coolness you only would expect from Samuel L. Jackson. Angela Bassett is one of the toughest women cinema has ever seen and Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Glenn Plummer, William Fichtner - every single role is casted perfectly...\n\n&quot;Strange Days&quot; is thriller, drama and big city ballad in one piece. I can´t remember any movie that reflects the philosophy of life of Generation X better than this one. Lenny deals with the &quot;Squids&quot; which are the experiences and emotions of men saved on a mini disc. Emotions as a product, a drug - a compensation of modern life for the growing loneliness and anonymity. The only possibility for weak persons like Lenny to feel real. A movie like &quot;Fight Club&quot; wouln´t have been possible without &quot;Strange Days&quot;; other releases like &quot;The Cell&quot; or even Scorsese´s &quot;Bringing out the dead&quot; copied the incomparable make. Although this film is older than six years it hasn´t lost anything explosive effects, what is connected with the video clip style this movie has, which gives &quot;Strange Days&quot; a touch of being ageless. The two most brilliant scenes are the opening sequence - the robbery in the Chinese restaurant - and the showdown down in the streets at the millenium party. Also the soundtrack (Deep Forest, Peter Gabriel, Skunk Anansia, Strange Fruit...) is one of the best I´ve ever heard, what makes &quot;Strange Days&quot; an unforgettable experience for every watcher.

      "reviewBody": "Sergio Leone&apos;s films are all love letters to America, the American dreams of an Italian who grew up at the movies, who apprenticed with Wyler, and Aldrich, signed himself Bob Robertson, and gave us Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson as we know them.  Sadly, America didn&apos;t always repay the compliment.  Leone&apos;s were &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot;, money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone&apos;s genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven&apos;s Gate of its day. That film&apos;s canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro&apos;s (&quot;Noodles&apos;&quot;) opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director&apos;s intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don&apos;t get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. It will deliver for decades of viewing to come."

      "name": "Showman Raj Kapoor arrives on the scene",
      "reviewBody": "More than six decades back, a very young man proved his talent at a very tender age of 24 years and within less than a decade, that young man started being called as the showman of Indian cinema and amassed a lot of respect. This 24 years old youth was Raj Kapoor who had demonstrated his worth in his directorial debut itself which was Aag (1948).\n\nAag (fire) is an emotional story whose protagonist Kewal (Raj Kapoor) wants to make it big in the world of theatre. He starts cherishing this dream since his childhood itself and one more extension of his dream is to stage the classic story of Sanskrit poet - Bilwamangal and his sweetheart - Chintamani with himself playing the role of Bilwa, the hero and his childhood buddy - Nimmi playing the role of Chintamani, the heroine. Destiny separates Nimmi from him and after growing up, not only he starts pursuing his dream with the help of Rajan (Prem Nath) but also searches his Nimmi only in every girl he comes across. However, his thirst of getting the association of his childhood-love, Nimmi in his life and his theatre-world remains unquenched. The ladies entering his life have to leave him due to the worldly constraints. One day, out of frustration, he sets his own theatre on fire and gets burnt. His face is disfigured and uglified due to the burnings suffered. However, finally he gets married to a girl selected by his parents, only to get the most pleasant surprise of his life on their first conjugal night.\n\nThis black and white movie is a showcase of the brilliance and the abundant talent of the great artist - Raj Kapoor. How he could make popular and impressive movies becomes clear when we watch this maiden venture of himself as a filmmaker (producer as well as director). He had the vision and the ability to pick the pulse of the audience as to what it thought and what it wanted to see on the screen. Aag is not so pleasant as his later movies are. In fact, it is a dark movie, delving deep into the psyche of a youth with sky in his eyes and the pain of losing his childhood-love in his heart. The fact that the hero tries to locate his childhood-love (Nimmi) in every woman he comes across tells a lot about the passionate love and the peculiar lover-psyche. When a girl Nirmala (Kamini Kaushal) has to part ways with him quite reluctantly, the viewer is able to see and realize the pain in her heart (in addition to the pain in the heart of the hero). It&apos;s the sheer brilliance of Raj Kapoor that he repeated this scene (with the same dialogues bidding farewell to her) after a few reels with another leading lady (Nargis) and no monotony is felt by the viewer. In the climax, the viewer can empathize with the happiness of the protagonist as well.\n\nRaj Kapoor could make his musical team properly with his second movie - Barsaat (1949) only. However at least one member of his musical team - Mukesh got associated with him in this movie itself and he sang one of the most memorable songs for him in this movie only - Zinda Hoon Is Tarah Ki Gham-e-Zindagi Nahin (a pain-soaked Ghazal authored by Behzaad Lakhnavi). Ram Ganguly composed touching songs for this movie including Kaahe Koyal Shor Machaaye Re, Dekh Chaand Ki Or, Raat Ko Ji Chamke Taare, Dil Toot Gaya Ji Chhoot Gaya, Solah Baras Ki Bhayi Umariya etc.\n\nThis movie cannot boast of high production value considering the limited resources of Raj Kapoor at that time. Still technically, it is admirable by all means. Cinematographer has done a brilliant job in conveying the intensity of the story with the use of lights and shadows. In fact, I feel that considering the dark nature of the story and its presentation, it&apos;s good that it got made in the black and white era. The lack of colours has assisted the darkness embedded in the screenplay and the characters to come out vividly before the audience.\n\nPerformance wise talking, Raj Kapoor has proved in Aag that he was not just an excellent director, he was an equally excellent actor too. He has depicted the ambitions, emotions and frustration of the young protagonist very well through his eyes, gestures and voice. Nargis got associated with the R.K. Banner with this movie and gave the glimpses of the famous Raj-Nargis chemistry that became properly visible in the later movies of the banner. Kamini Kaushal and Nigar Sultana have also done pretty well. \n\nOne interesting trivia is that three decades later to Aag, Raj Kapoor again used the incident of the burning of the face of a lead character in Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978). This time, it was the heroine of the movie. The sound of the foot-steps of Raj Kapoor&apos;s much later and over-ambitious project - Mera Naam Joker (1970) can also be heard in this movie (through the coming in and going out of women in the protagonist&apos;s life).\n\nI recommend this black and white emotional saga to all the fans of Raj Kapoor, all the viewers liking emotional movies and those who are interested in knowing how the art of filmmaking got evolved in Bollywood post the Independence of our country. Despite, certain weaknesses and certain over the top things, this maiden venture of the great showman is highly laudable."

But basically THE BOTTOM LINE IS this film is fantastic to watch if you&apos;re a teen (14-17?) sat at home with your mates, smoking some weed. otherwise the slightly bland acting and story line engulfs the fact that its a film about KIDS IN THE WOODS TAKING SHROOMS!, i mean come on, it has to be watched at least once doesn&apos;t it?\n\nNot a great plot, but the fact that it&apos;s a bit of a crazy film could make up for it if you are in the right state of mind. I wouldn&apos;t recommend watching this film if your looking for a serious type of &quot;oh my god I&apos;ve defecated my pants&quot; film.",

      "reviewBody": "This short film, commissioned by the Musee d&apos;Orsay to celebrate the artist Cezanne, is a complex piece that combines disparate elements to create less of a &apos;portrait&apos;, more of an personal essay. Straub and Huillet drew inspiration from Joachim Gasquet&apos;s book on Cezanne, and utilise letters exchanged between the two as much of the film&apos;s narration. The film also incorporates significant sections of Jean Renoir&apos;s 1934 film &apos;Madam Bovary&apos; and includes a segment in Straub and Huillet&apos;s often used &apos;epic theatre&apos; approach, with an actor reciting text in a emotionless tone within a still frame. Otherwise, the images on screen are largely stills of nature or paintings, with the narration providing Cezanne&apos;s musings.\n\nThere is much for an audience to take away from this film (and it&apos;s similar companion piece, &apos;Une visite au Louvre&apos;) but it is far from a conventional documentary, perhaps not a documentary at all. Those familiar with Straub and Huillet&apos;s work will be at home here, but others may be puzzled by the idiosyncratic approach. Challenging, but worth seeing.",

Jesper Christensen is sublime and proves that he&apos;s not only one of the best Danish actors, but one of the best, period. It&apos;s a film about overcoming illness, staying together as a family and about giving up hopes and dreams to support your loved ones.\n\nNormally, I&apos;m not overly fond of the kitchen-sink approach that most Danish films tend to use, but when it&apos;s this well acted, with a tight script, it&apos;s hard not to be touched.\n\nPernille Fischer Christensen is a very talented director and she orchestrates the film beautifully and sure-footed. If you can handle a tough, no-holds-barred drama, A Family delivers and stays with you afterwards.",

After divorcing the second wife--a shrew (Adrienne Barbeau)--he drops in on the kid (Keith Gordon) to discover the kid is not if a fraternity or on the diving team. The kid wants to drop out so Rodney decides to go BACK TO SCHOOL to encourage the kid. Great premise.\n\nOf course Rodney becomes a free-spending, beer-swilling college frosh to the delight of the student body and school administration. Rodney spews and almost unending barrage of jokes and one-liners and is hysterically funny. But beyond the crass character, this is one time when Dangerfield also shows some acting chops and some sweetness to his character. And it works! Top supporting cast helps out a lot too. Sally Kellerman is the English prof. Paxton Whitehead is the snotty business teacher. Robert Downey is the bizarro roomie. Ned Beatty plays Dean Martin. William Zabka is the obnoxious rival. Terry Farrell is the too-tall girl friend. Burt Young plays Lou the bodyguard. Edie McClurg is the secretary. Sam Kinison is the shell-shocked history prof. Severn Darden is the lab guy. M. Emmett Walsh is the diving coach. Jason Hervey is Dangerfield as a kid. And Danny Elfman appears as his Oingo Boingo self and scored the film.\n\nThe diving finale is hysterically funny and the perfect ending for this sweet and funny movie."

      "reviewBody": "Simple, Thrilling, and Very Entertaining. Unstoppable never tries to be anything more than it is. It follows a runaway train that occurred in Pennsylvania and the two men that try to stop it. First off, I gotta five Tony Scott credit for making a film about trains, that in itself is pretty interesting. How many people know about and use trains regularly? Then take that and turn into one of the most suspenseful, entertaining films of the year culminates into a really good time. The film&apos;s opening credits starts with how the train was lost and runs away, so right off the bat you know that it&apos;s not going to be a dull film. Before any of the main characters are brought into the story the antagonist and therefore the action get underway. Your then introduced to Will, played by Chris Pine, and Frank, played by Denzel Washington. Will is the rookie conductor that is placed under the veterans Frank&apos;s wing. Then you have Connie, played by Rosario Dawson, as the head of all the trains currently running, basically a conductor that oversees all operations, who is in charge of finding a solution to the runaway train, while also dealing with the corporate suits, mainly Oscar Galvin, played by Kevin Dunn, who are more interested in stock prices and money losses then the overall safety and physical damage the train could cause. So, after some failed attempts to stop the train, Denzel comes up with a plan to stop it, and this is where Will and Frank become involved with the runaway.\n\nTony Scott does a pretty good job of making the runaway train look menacing, almost like a monster that no matter what you do always keeps coming for you. The majority of special effects and stunt work were done realistically with very little CGI being used, which for me is always a plus. With it being based on a true story he definitely uses a lot of tactics to make it feel less like a film and more like your actually watching the action happen presently. There&apos;s a lot of bird eye shots of the trains making it feel like a news helicopters are shooting it, while also cutting to news broadcasts following the runaway train through the majority of the film creating a more realistic view of the whole story. He also filmed on location in Pennsylvania, which was pretty cool living in central PA and having the opportunity to talk with some of the crew. \n\nAs for the characters, the first half of the film, is where the majority of the very little character development comes into play. Will and Frank bicker back and forth at each other, when unsurprisingly they find a common bond through broken families with their wives and children. There are also many conversations, which mostly turn into arguments, between Connie and Oscar about how to stop the runaway train and the potential problems it could cause. Yet, due to the pacing and strategic place of key conversations you end up caring about the characters and are pulling for them to get out of this disaster alive. The most important and character revealing dialogue occurs during the more explosion filled scenes with the train. \n\nOverall, it&apos;s a pretty fun time, and never has a boring moment. Just when you think the dialogue may be getting a bit to breathy and boring, Scott crashes the runaway into some object causing a major explosion. It&apos;s one of those no brain activity films that you can just sit back and enjoy. The characters are there and Scott makes sure not to fill the runtime up with too much dialogue, but with just enough to develop Frank, Will, and Connie into people we want to see succeed. Lastly, it doesn&apos;t try to be anything more than it is. It&apos;s a film about a runaway train and the people trying to stop it, that&apos;s it. Unstoppable is a thrilling ride and a guaranteed enjoyable viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "Van Peebles directs a great cast in this detached-from-reality film about a truly evil drug-lord with a head for business and murder (Snipes), and a tough, street-wise pair of cops (Ice-T and Judd Nelson) hell-bent on bringing him down. The message is an important one - slogans are not going to win the war on drugs, and the way the message is carried in the film is more subtle than you might expect. The end of the film makes the point very clear, and I won&apos;t discuss it because I do not write spoilers. Like many of the more intelligent films made in the early 1990s, New Jack City is also an indictment of the euphoria of the Reagan years - telling the true story of what that time was like for those living from paycheck to paycheck, or trying to live without one, and dealing with the invisible &quot;war on drugs&quot; which had little to no effect on anybody in our inner-city neighborhoods.\n\nSnipes, Ice-T, Allen Payne and Chris Rock give stand-out performances, and the rest of the cast provide excellent support. The film also stars New York City, and definitely has an NYC flavor (seasoned with more than a pinch of Hollywood). The cinematography is a little breathless - not unusual for the genre but in this case a bit extreme. The script is good, but perhaps too dense with rich plot details. And the editing provides a few pacing problems toward the middle of the film which, combined with the over-abundance of subplots, detract from the development of the main themes. The soundtrack is excellent - including a nice mix of hip-hop, rap, contemporary soul, and dance music - all blended nicely with the imagery of the film. Van Peebles style is well developed in this film, but I felt that some aspects of the plot were a little too outrageous for the seriousness of the film&apos;s message, and I fear that the message may have been lost on many of the film&apos;s viewers.\n\nOverall, this is a good film. Entertaining and thoughtful, but definitely not for everybody.",

Jet Li&apos;s natural charm &amp; cheekiness shine through, ably supported by fellow wushu team members. He doesn&apos;t perform as much wushu as he does in Shaolin Temple but it is still beautifully performed BY HIM. On alot of his later films (especially after Born to defence, where he hurt his back severely) he has substituted stunt men for the more intensive and dangerous fight choreography, which is fair enough considering he is not a trained stunt man. Therefore i relish watching this movie to see this gorgeous man do that wushu that he do so well!"

It&apos;s worth to go see it. It has absolutely nothing inappropriate. It&apos;s clean and again, great. Vanesssa Hudgens and Aly Michalka are great in it. Gaelan Connell in a very natural and sincere actor. These are all very talented actors and shouldn&apos;t be type-casted. You see genuine acting with a lot of heart. The musicians were incredibly good. Better than a lot of famous bands out there. Very entertaining and funny at times. It deserved much more than it got, not to mention that theaters only gave this movie, (at least here in Georgia), two viewings on weekends maximum and where I actually live only one at 9:35 PM in it&apos;s first week. They give awful movies more than that, but a clean movie like this one, nothing. I truly recommend this movie to every parent and teen, especially if they like music and I guarantee you, you&apos;ll be very surprised. This isn&apos;t just another teen movie, it&apos;s pure gold.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s really too bad about American Roots Music.  So many of us have been aching for an intelligent and comprehensive series on the subject. Sadly, this isn&apos;t it.  Initially broadcast via PBS, many of the PBS stations didn&apos;t even pick it up since it was of such little substance and production values.\n\nThose of us who know much about the subject were insulted, while those who knew little or nothing were confused and disinterested.\n\nThe main problem with the series, seems to be it&apos;s lack of cohesive focus (jumping back and forth in the first two episodes from decade to decade, from one music form to another, with no effort at providing a cohesive segue linking the information in any way.  Secondarily, the series merely glosses over the already acknowledged &quot;stars&quot; of each genre, paying far more attention to some (Flaco Jimenez, himself gets 15 minutes, while the folk music genre gets 20 minutes)and ignoring many, many others altogether.\n\nWe feel that the producer&apos;s heart was in the right place, but the production was either rushed to take advantage of piggybacking on the success of Ken Burns&apos; Jazz series and companion book, or not infused with enough research and energy to make it move.  Weak and poorly written narration presented by Kris Kristofferson (that bastion of Roots Music, himself!?)merely bogged down the already lifeless production.  Further adding insult to injury was the frequent interpolation of pastoral scenes of countrysides, static shots of rivers and ponds, fuzzy and irrelevant archival footage. Interview segments with performers like Marty Stuart, Bonnie Raitt, and others, overstayed their welcome as the same sources were shown again and again and again.\n\nWith such a rich subject, a zillion good research sources, and a budget obviously adequate to make 4 segments, it is confounding how such a mediocre piece could have made it to air at all.",

      "name": "West German Comedy with Heinz ERHARDT and Christine KAUFMANN",
      "reviewBody": "Lovesick trip to the Black Forest? - West German film comedy with Heinz Erhardt and GOLDEN GLOBE winner Christine Kaufmann\n\nFinally holidays! The somewhat aging Gottlieb Singer (Heinz Erhardt), archivist at the trendy Zeitblick magazine in beautiful Hamburg, is, like Bolle, looking forward to his hiking holiday in the Black Forest. On the train, however, a lovely older lady (Käthe Haack) puts her precocious granddaughter in the care of him. And this Kiki Cornelius (Christine Kaufmann) has it all behind her ears. Instead of continuing on to boarding school, she follows the die-hard bachelor, whose relaxing hiking vacation now runs into one complication after the next. Kiki pulls out all the stops, gambles away all the money in the casino, picks up two young students (Michael Lenz and the singer Peter Wegen) and doesn&apos;t take the truth too seriously. In the meantime, the unsuspecting Gottlieb sends his friend Hiss (Werner Finck), editor at Zeitblick, his photos, which of course also feature the enchanting Kiki, to be developed. He uses the recordings to create a whole series about the &quot;last pedestrian&quot;, which promptly hits like a bomb and becomes a sales success for the ailing magazine. But that&apos;s just where the problems for Gottlieb and the little brat begin...\n\nWhat turbulent fun! With humor and catchy singing, beautiful images from the Black Forest and harmless misunderstandings, this film, released in 1960, still breathes the spirit of the 1950s. The entertaining film was directed by Wilhelm Thiele in the film studios in Göttingen. In one scene you can see Heinz Erhardt walking down the stairway in the bustling neighboring town of Kassel.\n\nWith Christine Kaufmann (1945-2017), the comedy star had a busy colleague at his side in those days. The year before she played at 14 years old! The enchanting lover of muscle god Steve Reeves (1926-2000) in &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. A year after the hike with Heinz Erhardt, she played the wife of the German blonde Joachim Hansen in &quot;Via Mala&quot;. After that, she was ready for Hollywood and her momentous marriage to Tony Curtis (1925-2010).\n\nBy the way, Käthe Haack (1897-1986), who played the mother of the title hero in the outstanding film version of &quot;Emil und die Detektive / Emil and the Detectives&quot; (1931), can be seen as Kiki&apos;s trusting grandmother.\n\nThe appearance of the magnificent Trude Herr (1927-1991) as a cheeky Rhinelander on the train is obligatory. The Cologne veteran had already appeared in front of the camera with Heinz Erhardt for &quot;Drillinge an Bord&quot; and &quot;Natürlich die Autofahrer / Naturally the Drivers&quot; (both 1959). When the old Erhardt films were shown on television in 1984 and surprisingly (for the television producers) achieved ratings records, Trude Herr in particular benefited from the renewed popularity (Heinz Erhardt had unfortunately died five years earlier after a long period of suffering). Her health-related move to the Fiji Islands in the summer of 1987, which the die-hard Cologne resident celebrated with her farewell hymn &quot;Niemals geht man so ganz / You never go quite like that,&quot; will be unforgettable. Goosebumps still today!",

This is one of the problems in reviewing old movies. Should they be judged by current standards or should allowances be made for age? Personally my answer is that the only fair way to solve the problem is to give two ratings on all movies prior to say 1935, one using current standards and the other allowing for age . This would be particularly important for silent films. Using that approach I would give this serial a five for today but a 7 for 1932. If you doubt this try watching other movies of its day-they do not make very interesting watching today with very few exceptions.",

The film managed to be informative, conveying both dire consequences of increasing atmospheric CO2 along with what is being done to combat this. The brilliance of the film is it remains upbeat by focusing on individuals who are using techniques both within the ecosystem and the world economy that are effective.\n\nHe starts with a cartoon of Mr. CO2, with two little oxygen ears, that is disarming without being insulting. There are the stock images of glens that had been glaciers not that long ago, with explanations of what is lost beyond scenic views. There is enough earth science, botany and microbiology to be challenging without the need to pull out a notebook.\n\nByck, who made this film over the course of four years with only his wife as a co-creator, weaved the many individual interviews together perfectly, including a man who had organized small Texas farmers into a large cooperative wind farm, they had a steady income for the first time, as we all benefited, when the farmer stated that he did it single handedly, we were all in on the joke since his loss of one arm had been evident from the beginning of his interview.\n\nThe flaw, I hope not fatal, was the minimization of the political opposition to what he is suggesting, which will take an expansion of &quot;big government&quot; to implement. His choice of the major human interest subject, Van Jones, a person who was forced out of his Obama White House position, based on his documented left wing radical statements, was a bit of unfortunate self indulgence.\n\nIt will be difficult enough to convert those industrialists who are profiting from the status quo, without further supporting the right wing canard that green is not the new Red, White and Blue, but just the new Red."

The movie did a great job in establishing everything I needed to know.\n\nI loved how it combined cartoons, live action and CGI. It was flawless. And I was amazed that they dared to have so much of the movie in plain old hand animation. I enjoyed the plot, but I sometimes wished they would have made it a bit more complex, as that could safely have been done without making it harder to understand for children.\n\nThe first part of the movie seems like what could have been a regular episode, with small Banderas-breaks in between. The latter part is the fish out of water-story, which could probably have worked just as well without the build up from the first part.\n\nI&apos;m sure children loves this movie, and if you&apos;re open to silly characters breaking the fourth wall, you&apos;ll have no trouble watching it with them.",

      "reviewBody": "No wonder that California isn&apos;t as popular as so many other Spaghetti-Western. It is entertaining but not funny like My Name is Nobody or violent like Four of the Apocalypse. IMO California is one of the last real Spaghetti Western but the filmmakers didn&apos;t want to do a typical Western. Somehow it reminds of one of the many 50&apos;s Western flicks but with a darker a more sinister story. Maybe you can compare California with Keoma or The great Silence. Also like in these Movies it isn&apos;t so easy to say who really the hero is. Is it Guiliano Gemma as California, who hates his old name and has enough from all that Killing and Shooting? His opponent is Raimund Harmsdorf a German actor and is best known in supporting roles in so many B-Movies or German TV Shows. In California Harmsdorf has a fairly good role and he did some fine acting. He is a ruthless Bounty Hunter who kills Confederates Soldiers for Money. Unfortunately politics changes and he is getting an Outlaw. For a SW there are interesting characters and not just a faceless Hero and his Villain. Sorry but the figures aren&apos;t simply Black and White in this drama and there are no funny jokes of Guiliano.\n\nI wasn&apos;t quite happy with this melodramatic Organ 70&apos;s like Music. In some way it fits in some not. The photography is bleach and the environment looks dirty. Towns and people seemed to be destroyed by the war and this world has nothing to do with the beauty as you can see in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some Scenes are taking place in a Ghost Town. These Scenes are very climatic and give the audience more of the Apocalyptic Feeling. The Storyline has two parts. A travel at the end of the American Civil War and then a Vendetta as it we have already seen in so many contributions to the Genre. But it wouldn&apos;t be a typical Spaghetti Western if this Vendetta wouldn&apos;t be different. California (1977) hasn&apos;t a lot in common with Gemma&apos;s first western A Pistol for Ringo (1964).\n\nFor me this melodramatic western was a big surprise. The storyline and the figures are fine written. It&apos;s not a Feel Good Movie or just another action loaded Hero Tale of the West. Of course it has some flaws and there are some weak points in the second part but overall it&apos;s an interesting flick. Director Michelle Lupo did a good job and it was his last serious western too. Buddy goes West (1981)is more a Comedy than a Western. One year later Lucio Fulci master of Giallo and Horror directed a Spaghetti Western with a similar look: Silver Saddle (1978). Guiliano Gemma is the main cast again but Fulci&apos;s Movie isn&apos;t so sinister and dark than this one. IMO these two Movies were the last Highlights of the Spaghetti Western Genre and then this fascinating Genre ended.",

When the dead man&apos;s body is examined, DNA is found which is similar to that of Eve, a human/alien hybrid (Natasha Henstridge) that has been created in a top-secret laboratory (from the same batch of embryos that resulted in Sil from the original Species movie).\n\nIt seems that one (or more) of the crew of the recent Mars mission is host to an alien, and unless they are captured, they will endeavour to procreate ASAP with as many partners as possible.\n\nSpecies II has a very silly story, with some particularly daft plot turns (Eve learns to drive from watching The Dukes of Hazzard!), but with lashings of quality gore (including several gruesome alien births and a shotgun blast to the head), better alien effects than the first film, and even more nudity, this sequel is still very enjoyable and worth watching if you liked the original.\n\nMichael Madsen returns as tough-guy Press, along with Marg Helgenberger as science bod Laura Baker, and also turning up for the fun is the ever reliable James Cromwell as the senator father of space hero Captain Ross.\n\nIf you&apos;re in the mood for some undemanding mindless sci-fi horror, then check out Species IIit&apos;s not as bad as a lot of people seem to think!",

They show you what happens when the honeymoon&apos;s over and &quot;real life&quot; begins. The interaction between Redford and Fonda is superb and flows smoothly, the acting is brilliant and shines brightly throughout the movie. It&apos;s like witnessing perfection. Even the supporting cast is marvelous with their humorous dialog and perfect timing. What I like best is the characters will have you laughing without even half trying. Everything is put together so splendidly. This is one of those movies where everything comes together: the actors, the writing, the scenery, the situation, and of course the performances.\n\nIn my opinion BAREFOOT IN THE PARK is a rare gem that should be seen by all."

This movie unfolds slowly and is more interested in philosophy and metaphysics than special effects. Pace your expectations accordingly and you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised.",

There&apos;s no plot, just people coming in and out and saying crazy lines, or lines that dont make sense (same thing?).  It might have been great in the mid-sixties, but it&apos;s kind of painful to watch now, it&apos;s more of an endurance test than an enjoyable film.  There are some funny moments, such as Edie continually sneezing and the props being introduced as cast members, but if you want to see Edie, see POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL or LUPE, you&apos;ll be much better off.",

      "name": "Morality of Murder    {Krzysztof Kieslowski}",
      "reviewBody": "Although this movie concerns itself with one of the paramount taboos, its evocative intensity is kept quite impassive. Perhaps the intention is to allow the viewer the freedom of choice: to either accept consciously, the facts of life, with all its &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot; aspects, {a form of realism}, or to resist the blind, impulsive irrationality of sado- masochistic gratification with all its pathological undertones.\n\nKieslowski divides his tale into three main parts - the first part introduces the three main characters - the candidate advocate who is being examined by the Board for his Bar entrance - we are introduced to a man of a sensitive nature, thoughtful and unconvinced after four years of practice that punishment is a deterrent {although he concedes that it might be a deterrent ,or at least intimidatory to those for whom crime is not a natural calling}. He offers a reference from Genesis stating that the threat of punishment did not deter Cain from murdering Abel. The next character is a youth who walks aimlessly looking at cinema posters, amusing himself in rebellious and anti-social ways. The third character is a taxi driver who is seen cleaning and shining his car. Kieslowski has given him a rather disagreeable personality.\n\nThe second part of the movie has the three main characters slowly and inexorably moving towards each other so that the precise details of their intertwined destinies can be unfolded. The advocate is seen with his wife in the same coffee house as the punkish youth. The youth then randomly selects a taxi to drive him to a desolate country road where in a slowly enacted, drawn out scene, he garottes and bludgeons the taxi driver, who begs for mercy on behalf of his wife and children. The viewer is left in no doubt as to the horror of the act as the youth raises a large stone and smashes the victims head with it.\n\nThe movie then experiences a jump cut in editing as the capture and trial of the murderer are omitted and the thread of the story continues with the youth being found guilty. This causes the advocate to go through a soul searching period of whether his defence of the youth was competent. Kieslowski, finally allows the viewer biographical access to the life of the youth/murderer - this is the only part of the movie driven by emotional values as we learn of the tragedies in his life and his need to be reassured that at least in death he would be buried close to his father and sister whom he both obviously loved. This is a brilliant preparatory moment as the viewer is made conscious of this up -to-now abstract figure, who up to this point had elicited no sympathy at all. Now the viewer is jolted into consciousness as the humanity of the murderer transforms him back into a human being.\n\nThe third part of the movie - the final curtain, is the carrying out of the death penalty.Unlike Hollywood, where as in &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, Sean Penn is shown walking to his doom still embracing his pride - Kieslowski depicts the taking of life, first, with the murder of the taxi driver in a long protracted scene, and then with the Judicial murder, a heart wrenching display of fear and struggle leaving the viewer feeling personally assaulted and gut-wrenched {at least that&apos;s how I felt}.\n\nOnly a master of the practice of art could have pulled this off. When one thinks of what to reference this movie to, other movies don&apos;t come to mind. Rather one has to look at literature {as I&apos;m sure Kieslowski did}. Dostoevsky&apos;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Musil&apos;s &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; spring to mind. I take the fact that this movie is to be compared with major works of literary art to be high praise indeed\n\nIf you want more than pulp movies then this philosophical discourse on the nature of life and death will leave you somehow enhanced and certainly more aware. Highly recommended."

He receives a silver locomotive from his colleagues in a dinner party and loses his last trip. After the retirement, the plain Horten seems to be lost and wanders through Oslo, where he helps Trygve Sissener (Espen Skjønberg) and they become friends. When Trygve invites him to take a ride in his car, the driver dies and Horten takes his dog Molly and his pair of skies. Horten has never worn a pair of skies and he tries for the first time. Later he travels with Molly and meets his old friend Svea (Henny Moan).\n\n&quot;O&apos; Horten&quot; is a cold film about retirement in Norway. The story is weird and the behavior of the characters is strange for a Brazilian. When the cooker is arrested in the restaurant, nobody moves from their tables. When Mr. Horten forgets his silver train at the room, his colleagues send it by mail. These cold relationships are really unusual in my tropical country. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Caro Sr. Horten&quot;(&quot;Dear Mr. Horten&quot;)",

There is a scene where he is looking at another person and you can&apos;t quite figure out, what he&apos;s up, what his true feelings are (his look is fatherly, but at the same time also menacing ... and curious) ... his facial expressions, his acting ability in general is really great and he really enjoys his role in this movie.\n\nWhile he is great, there are of course quite a few other things, that are letting him (and his performance) down. There is Asia Argento (very obviously and badly dubbed in french) and quite a few story tweaks, that you have to work around. If and when you do that, you will enjoy Gerard&apos;s almost one man show. The question is, are you willing to do that.",

      "reviewBody": "Roland Joffé did not disappoint me with this film. I am a first generation spaniard and I find Joffé&apos;s portrayal of the Civil War honest and fair. The story is not engulfed by facts of history, it takes great care in exploring the mysteries of the characters&apos; backgrounds.\n\nOn one side we have the historical figure of Jose Maria Escribar, tormented in his search for God and holding firmly to his ideals while submerged in a world of hatred and chaos. On the other Manolo, haunted by vengeance and confusion; fighting without a cause and desperately searching for something he can believe him, an answer to his inner chaos. Finally, Roberto, son of Manolo, must slowly unveil the terrible secrets his father has hidden within him and come to terms with finding out who the man that brought him up was.\n\nThe film explores the senseless nature of war and its consequences, the spiral of hatred that slowly engulfs men, the repentance for terrible mistakes and the struggle to forgive them. Each character follows a path filled with dilemmas and suffering at the end of which they must fight themselves and their dragons.\n\nTechnicalwise, the film is faultless. There is great care in every scene and as I can testify Joffé has done his homework. The detail to which the history and scenery of 1937 Spain has been recreated is astounding. Even so, the story talks about people, about soldiers; never about leaders or politicians. The film captures the essence of human conflict in its most raw form.\n\nDo not expect an action packed war film. For those who have interest in the roots of Opus Dei, this film will not help you there. It deals with the repercussions of war and strife in people, it does not deal with the grander scale of things.\n\nIf nothing else this film will reassure you that war is and always will be a futile tragedy, all victories are Pyrrhic and the aftermath leaves bitter resentment and pain. An interesting perspective in this film is that of the many bystanders who are forced to choose the side they support and so they must be separated from loved ones forever. When a few want war, the rest have no say. As long as the hatred of so few is not buried, war will rise once more.\n\nThere Be Dragons is a deeply personal and spiritual film. It is very intense and reflects unapologetically the worst side of humanity. It is true to the title, where this film takes you, there be dragons.",

      "reviewBody": "Legend of Eight Samurai...aka...Japanese Ripoff of American Blockbusters of late 70s and early 80s.\n\nThe majority of the plot stitched together by the patchwork of the first three Star Wars films.\n\nSo bitterly ironic since Lucas has credited the Japanese classic The Hidden Fortress by the late, great Akira Kurosawa as a heavy influence for his first Star Wars film.\n\nOpen as an evil empire converges at their fortress to solidify their evilness with the heads of the entire royal family. All save for one! A Princess?! They need to find the princess to complete their task!\n\nAnd of course, that feisty princess is on her way to meet up with her uncle.\n\nBut runs into a feisty, bratty pretty-boy who wants to be a fighter like the others. As well as her older protector who will unite a band of special warriors to defeat the Empire... Sound familiar?\n\nThis flick is chock-ful-o-Lucas-clichés:\n\nDarth Vader...err... I mean, the evil queen proclaiming the pretty-boy is her son. NOOOO! I&apos;ll never join you!\n\nThe group fighting a serpentine creature in the trash compacto...err... I mean, bowels of the Death Sta...err... I mean, Castle.\n\nObi Wan...err... I mean, Sonny Chiba&apos;s character constantly being the sage leading the feisty princess... all the while knowing his time is finite.\n\nThere&apos;s even rip-offs of the other great Lucas franchise, Raiders of the Lost Ark:\n\nThe re-creation of the famous boulder opening. Snakes, why does it always have to be snakes. And the over-abundance of pistols... even though everything else in the film dates it to a time long before pistols were even invented. Speaking of which, you gotta dig the times when they failed to eliminate modern elements from the shots. Like telephone poles.\n\nStill, campy fun. Thought truly painful at times. Like the love scene with the cheesy early 80s rock ballad score. They keep cutting back and forth between some painful, badly framed love-making shot and one of the eight samurai statues. So you keep counting off each Samurai statue shot, urging the editor to cut to another statue fast in order to end the painful scene.\n\nAnd as far as that other review I read that claimed video games ripped THIS movie off?! That is giving this little seen flick far too much credit."

Not only has he presented their world in a very wholesome way but his own comments on his motivations and ceremonies indicate a special sensitivity towards the whole argument and show what kind of a person he is. Additionally I find presenting the comments of the experts is very helpful to outsiders learning or researching on the matter. The overall presentation of the Shipibo world indicate a person who has approached the argument and experience with respect and in a knowledgeable way.\n\nI congratulate the filmmaker on his film. I work with the Shipibo-Konibo and they are family to me now, and the respect for their practices is totally shown here. \n\nA wonderful film everyone should see to learn more about the world&apos;s enriching diversity and themselves.\n\nGongratulations. I am looking forward to his next film on the topic. or any related one.",

      "reviewBody": "Swades was released in December 2004 and since then, this project was said to be considered by the director, Ashutosh Gowariker. The director of movies such as &quot;Laagan&quot; and &quot;Swades,&quot; has once again left no stones unturned and proved that he is also capable of directing a movie related the colossal personality - Akbar the Great, also known as &quot;Jalaludin Mohammed Akbar.&quot; A young Akbar, sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don&apos;t join him, are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that&apos;s when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have, misunderstood him. One particular Rajput Raja Bharmal, instead of facing the Moghul&apos;s mighty army, decides that it would be better that his daughter, Raj Kumari Jodhaa Bai, who is be throned to another Rajput Prince, marries Akbar. The couple do unite in marriage but only after Akbar agrees to the two conditions which the Rajput Princess has put forward. At the same time, he has to win her heart as well as to look after the interest of his public.\n\nJodhaa Akbar, which stars Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Khulbhushan Kharbanda, Suhasini Mulay, Digvijay Purchit and Punam S. Sinha, is a romantic, biographical and historical movie, which is set in a era of revolt, conspiracies and war. It also deals with intercaste marriage, which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India, the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands, the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and, or, forced to live with the Invaders.\n\nHrithik Roshan, son of the director and producer, Rakesh Roshan and nephew of the music director Rajesh Roshan, was offered this role as the director, Ashutosh Gowariker, who had seen him in &quot;Koi Mil Gaya.&quot; believed that he was capable of doing justice to this part and also because of his physique. His natural choice for the lead of &quot;Jodhaa Bai&quot; was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, not only just because of her beauty but talent as well. He has proved to be correct with the cast - brilliant as they have done justice to their respective parts.\n\nThis is a well written story by Haider Ali, and co written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker, which has gone into great details with research and choosing sites for filming. The cinematography, by Kiran Deohams, is excellent and some cases breath taking. The music, by A.R. Rehman, is pleasant and suits the genre movie and the songs, though a few, are good as well and especially the wedding night song. The costumes and jewellery, which I am sure that a lot of the members of the audience, will be looking out for, designed by the famous Neeta Lulla, is elegant. The stunts and the fight sequences, which are well timed, and though they look dangerous at times, are worthwhile watching. In one scene, where Akbar is seen fighting an elephant, actor Hrithik Roshan did get injured but continued with the filming. His injuries were related to those of when he was filming for &quot;Krissh.&quot; But really pushes the fight and stunt sequences, is the special effects by Pankaj Khandpur, which are worth to watch.\n\nConclusion: This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic, epic movie in the future, even though it is three and a half hours in duration. It is worth it.\n\nFor those interested in a bit of gossip. Hrithik Roshan, who has been offered to work in some Hollywood movies, may not have to go over to in at least one of them. The reason being is that actress Penelope Cruz, may be working with him in a yet untitled Bollywood movie, which is said to be directed by his father, Rakesh Roshan. Could it be that this is just the beginning of a merger between Hollywood and Bollywood? I wonder! Elsewhere, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, is soon to be working in a movie with the &quot;Mahatama,&quot; Ben Kingsley, with whom she has worked with before, in an English version of &quot;Taj Mahal.&quot; It seems like that she can&apos;t keep away from the family.",

It is about how three friends with disabilities (deaf-mute, lame and blind) get together to go out, and each one gets separated and lets himself go.\n\nYou can see that the film is very cheerful and narrates the ideal life of many everyday situations such as friendship, laughter and love. Everything is told from a superficial and unrealistic point of view, but it makes it dreamlike and entertaining.\n\nThe relationship of the characters is quite curious with each one having their own particularity and the dialogue is quite well done. It works a lot with the evolution of the characters and their connections such as &quot;laughter&quot;. In this sense, it combines the funny part with the emotion of connecting with someone.\n\nIn conclusion, I liked this movie for its originality and the evolution and connection of the characters.",

      "reviewBody": "The Battle of Chile surely must be the most interesting from the Chilean troubles from the 70&apos;s, handled with style &amp; fervour by the passionate director, who by all accounts is a left-wing sympathiser.  The film starts with a roar with the failed coup d&apos;etat, &amp; from there builds up the tragic story of the Allende lead &quot;Marxist&quot; party, telling us who plotted against them &amp; why, all set behind the backdrop of mass public support, eventually quashed by right-wing terror.  The film has to be admired also for publicly stating that the CIA helped the bourguoise eventually kill close to 30,000 people, and the fact that this film was a huge risk to the lives of the makers (who had to smuggle it out of Chile and edit it as exiles). Overall it deals with the worker&apos;s plight not only in Chile, but as a case study around the world (Brazil &amp; Bolivia for example), and only watching these types of films (this is part 2 of a trilogy) do you sense the realities of this world, and shake off the ideals set by society.  Well worth a watch.",

There is about an F word every 2 minutes and close up scenes of breasts, so this movie is not for kids. I&apos;d say 14 and up. All out good teen movie. I would recommend it strongly."

The killer&apos;s reason for killing everybody was so stupid and didn&apos;t make any sense whatsoever. I hate that I wasted my money on it, and even worse than that my time. I see exactly why it went straight to video. The lead girl&apos;s acting, in my opinion, was so bad and over the top at times. I would not advise anyone to watch this. I was embarrassed for the more known actors who participated in this stupid movie. I bet they regret it. My advice, PICK ANOTHER MOVIE!!!!!",

She then offers two choices to Kaiji: spend 10 years paying off his loan or board a gambling boat for one night to repay his debt and possibly make a whole lot more. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous Endo is actually conning Kaiji, believing he won&apos;t come back from his voyage. Kaiji is then up for the night of his lifeÂ…Â…",

      "reviewBody": "By 1999 Takeshi Kitano had quite rightly gained a lot of international recognition for his brilliantly constructed Yakuza/Cop stories, but was apparently dis-satisfied that everybody tended to focus on the violence in them. So he decided to make a movie without any violence to remind people that he was a much more rounded talent than that. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot;, the world asked. &quot;Yes&quot;, he replied... and made Kikujiro.\n\n Kikujiro is difficult to adequately describe, but the fact that it was allegedly inspired by the Wizard of Oz is a good starting point. The basic premise is a road trip, where Kitano is the unlikely chaperone for a little boy who wants to go and find his mother. After gambling away all the money his wife gives him to take the kid, they have to improvise their transport across the country. Along the way they meet a small but colourful cast of characters, and get to know each other a little bit too.\n\n I&apos;d hesitated about picking this up for ages, and eventually went for a rental rather than a purchase. Kitano minus violence just didn&apos;t seem right! But that was definitely an injustice I was doing him, and Kikujiro is a good demonstration that his talents really are much broader. In fact, after watching it there is no doubt that he is one of the greatest director/actor/writer and editor working in the world today. A brilliantly painted story, full of subtly and quirkiness. Awesome cinematography and an incredible soundtrack... truly world class in every respect. Well, to be fair the child actor was a bit stiff, but it seems mean to hold that against the movie. \n\nDefinitely recommended if you haven&apos;t already seen it!",

There is the usual bandits fighting it out for gold bars, quick stops at the tavern, fights between rival bandits, Mexicans, and most clichés of the genre. What does stand out though is that the main characters are quite amusing, and you find yourself rooting for them as they are faced with several face-offs while trying to get their gold and come out on top.\n\nThis film certainly has that low brow Lenzi quality to it, so if you enjoy his films, and general light hearted pasta flicks, then I recommend this film for you.\n\n6/10.",

However; some of the off-the-wall jokes will have you laughing your face off, and will keep returning to your mind, making you laugh days after you watched the film. The acting is par, and Steven Colbert delivers the funniest performance I&apos;ve seen in a long while.\n\nDon&apos;t go into this film looking for genius or groundbreaking comedy mastery; go into this film expecting a decent laugh which you won&apos;t regret.",

After a while, who even cares about Robert Towne&apos;s serpentine plot twists. The reason this movie still works is simple - it is great entertainment. This movie takes 3 stars at the peak of their physical beauty who were just beginning to realize their acting potential (admittedly, in the years since, only 2 of them realized that potential). Michelle Pfeiffer attained a perfect trifecta in 1988 with comedy (Married to the Mob), drama (Dangerous Liasons), and this melodramatic actioner. The movie takes itself too seriously, but we don&apos;t have to. It&apos;s a silly fantasy world with stunning beach sunsets, tequila and sports cars, good drug dealers and bad cops, etc. Like Miami Vice, this movie portrayed the late 80s, and for those of us who grew up during that flashy, fun decade, _Tequila Sunrise_ is a fun-filled nostalgic trip. It&apos;s about a beautiful people living angst filled lives.\n\n It&apos;s mindless and fun. So enjoy it for what it is.",

      "reviewBody": "La Leyenda (2008), a.k.a. The Legend (2008), is a really weird DVD. First of all, the synopsis on the back of the case has absolutely not the slightest connection with this movie at all. True, the photos are those of the stars, Pablo Rago as young Milliardi, Benjamin Rojas as his stop-at-nothing rival, and the lovely Leonora Rojas as the girl in between. The credits, however, are not those of this movie either. It was actually directed (masterfully too!) by Sebastián Pivotto, not by Eric Brevig, from a cleverly twisting script by Alejandro Ocón and Chavo D&apos;Emilio, not by Michael Wess, Mark Levin and some indecipherable Jemmifer (Jennifer?) Flaciett (?). So it&apos;s actually not a film noir – as the DVD promised – but a racing car picture, but far and away superior to any that Elvis Presley ever made. Admittedly, I&apos;m not a fan of the Presley meanwhile-back-in-the-nice-comfortable-studio oeuvre but this is really gritty stuff. Looks like the real thing. Exciting too!",

And yes the first part of the movie was kind of slow.\n\nBut then the movie got interesting when the girls met. They&apos;re relationship progression was fun to watch, and I thought they rode their horses well considering they&apos;re little girls. I also liked the cow hands. Some laugh out loud moments with those guys.\n\nI also found Robert Wagner as a bad guy amusing. Wish he had more scenes.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a nice pleasant movie without the murder and mayhem, this is it.",

She was either yelling at Pitt all the time or gushing over a hit-man who admitted he was gay, and both routines wore thin. She thought (being gay) that was just the greatest thing and really overdid it. \n\nOverall, if you modified Roberts&apos; character into someone less abrasive this might have been a &quot;keeper.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Alright, listen. This special is all over the place. It&apos;s awkwardly animated (to say the least), the story is weakly fashioned around a satirical Christmas song (and is more filler than genuine, holly-jolly entertainment), the voice acting is subpar, and, at 51 minutes, it&apos;s way too long. But all those things are what make this ridiculous little movie so endearing. It&apos;s something I would watch as a kid and enjoy, if for nothing more than the simple story and jokes. It was a little too long to hold my attention throughout, even then, but it still had something special about it that kept me coming year after year. Now, it&apos;s good for the fun factor of it. You can&apos;t put this on expecting to see A Charlie Brown Christmas-level of quality, because that&apos;s just not it. When taken for that it is (a quick attempt for Warner Bros. to cash in on the hit Dr. Elmo song), it offers just enough to give a little holiday cheer. Shoehorning in a bunch of cuts off Dr. Elmo&apos;s Christmas record of the same name, it makes for some of the most awkward, inappropriately inserted musical numbers, perhaps, in this history of animated movies. It&apos;s worthy of countless razzies and that&apos;s why I love it.",

Soon, victims are found, slain with bullets from Mifune&apos;s gun.  The man-hunt is on, while Tokyo goes through a devastating heatwave, and Mifune goes through an equally devastating change (&quot;A Stray Dog sees only what it chases&quot; a detective warns him.) Made well before Akira Kurosawa became famous for &quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;Stray Dog&quot; is a roaring classic!  Every character&apos;s movement reflects either the horrid heatwave, or the living conditions.  It is ironic that a downpour (Kurosawa&apos;s favorite on-screen weather condition) breaks the heat just as the tensions in the film mount.   How &quot;Bicycle Thief&quot; reflected the times of post war Italy, this classic does the same for post war Japan."

      "reviewBody": "The official version about Kurt Früh&apos;s films &quot;Bäckerei Zürrer&quot; (1957), &quot;Hinter den Sieben Gleisen&quot; (1959) and &quot;Es Dach Ueberem Chopf&quot; (1961) is, according to Werner Wider&apos;s reference work &quot;Der Schweizer Film&quot; (2 vols., Zurich 1981, 1989) that Früh&apos;s work stands under strong until copying influence from Italian Neo-realism, especially from the movies by Pietro Germi (1914-1974). As it seems, nobody could and still can imagine that Switzerland had once a film director, who was capable of having own ideas and being being able to transport them into movies whose quality can be compared to those of the surrounding states at the end of the fifties and beginning of the sixties. Here I propose a quite new interpretation: Früh calls his movies explicitly &quot;Märchenfilme&quot; (fairy-tale movies): The plot-line follows not only causality, but wonders are used as stereotypes. Amidst of the rails in Zurich main station, three old bums (Clochards) live in a shabby hut. One evening, when they come home, they here someone crying in their dwelling. They find a young German (foreign) mother who is just about giving birth. By aid of their friend, an older gate-woman, the baby is delivered. - Did Früh here not simply give a modern version of the Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar Story, the Three King or Three Magi story in the gospel by St. Matthew 2? But so artistically disguised that nobody ever came to this disclose the background in more than half a century? The oldest of the three Kings has been named &quot;Balthasar&quot;: he had a big dark beard. In Kurt Früh&apos;s version his name is &quot;Barbarossa&quot; and his beard is red. In the tradition, it has been Emperor Barbarossa who has brought the relics of the three Saint Kings in their definitive place. If this interpretation is correct, then Inge and her child stand for Mary and the newborn Christ. He, however, did not enter this world in a railroad hut, but at least in an animal-stable. An interesting non-parallel between the two versions is that, not untypical for Früh, his &quot;Mary&quot; (Inge) has been left by the child-father, she is does not searching for an asylum together with her Joseph, but attempts suicide by running in front of an engine. Although the three Clochards, unlike the three Magi, do not come to visit the new-born child and crowd it by gifts, they start to work for mother and child and bring home their newly purchased items on every payday. An interesting detail: As we learn later in the movie, the father of Inge&apos;s child is the son of a producer of paper-products (stationary). We know, that paper is made from wood, and Joseph in the Bible was a carpenter.",

OK at times the screenplay does stray away from it&apos;s original context and the stereotypical WASP family may reinforce unrealistic portrayals of Hollywood, but with this, with a little effort on our behalf, we the audience can allow ourselves to be whisked away into the young boys adventure, out of the harsh realities of life. When analysed, issues of father and son relationships and the transition of boy to manhood become quite clear. Taking into consideration that the film was made nearly ten years ago, I feel it serves importantly as balance between strong realism and fairy tale.",

      "reviewBody": "In the early 1930s Fox Studios went from extreme commercial and critical success with hits like State Fair and Best Picture winner Cavalcade, to being among the most heavily indebted production companies, and was one of the first to go into receivership. The release of Marie Galante in 1934 came from a studio in a state of panic, and is one of many curious little pieces from the era.\n\nMarie Galante was directed by Henry King, one of the longest-serving and most respected men at Fox. This picture finds him at his most baroque and artistically European in style. During the opening scenes the camera tracks along following Ketti Gallian through a number of settings, but she is back amid the clutter of the sets. This draws our attention to the star, but gives us the feeling of voyeurs stood outside the action. Later, in the office where we first meet Spencer Tracy and the other secret service people, a huge whirring fan and its shadow dominate every shot. It&apos;s not only a reminder of the oppressive heat, but touches like this give the environment a character of its own. The only time we are totally focused on the actors it is via gritty close-ups. There were only a handful of directors in Hollywood during this era who were giving such prominence to the sets, but they were mostly Germans like Fritz Lang and Josef von Sternberg.\n\nAppropriately enough for this European flavouring, the star of Marie Galante is a French woman. Ketti Gallian&apos;s looks and some extent her mannerisms make her appear as another Marlene Dietrich, and this is probably why the studio snapped her up. Compared to the German siren though she is a somewhat bland, and makes a rather weak and forgettable heroine. Spencer Tracey, his star on the ascendant, provides a steady and realistic performance, but he seems just a little constrained by this rather stolid role. Amid all the stark sets and quirky angles, resolutely American character players Ned Sparks and Stepin Fetchit seem strangely out of place, although sensibly their roles have not been emphasised too much, and they at least give the picture its only flashes of warmth and humour.\n\nMarie Galante is a strange little picture and the way it is made is even stranger. The plot points don&apos;t seem directed towards the audience. Instead, understanding it is like watching a group of people across a restaurant and trying to piece together their relationships. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s difficult to follow, just that doing so is a slightly cold and alienating experience. It does look incredibly neat and stylish, and is vaguely interesting simply for the oddity that it is, but the sense of vitality and connection that 30s Hollywood usually offered is sadly missing.",

      "reviewBody": "Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.\n\nThe plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.\n\nWhat makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill&apos;s interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. \n\nTechnically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. \n\nEditing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky&apos;s photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. \n\nILM&apos;s visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. \n\nAgain, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt&apos;s sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.\n\nHowever, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. \n\nCongratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."

      "name": "Great cast, plot falters in second half",
      "reviewBody": "Buoyed by the strength of its cast, for the first 55 minutes or so this is a pretty decent silent film, featuring two brothers (Ramon Novarro and Ernest Torrence) in a love triangle with a young woman (Joan Crawford). Novarro is magnetic and was at the height of his stardom, Crawford a pretty young thing just about to hit it big (albeit in very different types of roles), and Torrance perfectly cast as the hulking seaman. The brothers sail off to Singapore and face misadventures along the way, including a storm while rounding Cape Horn, the special effects for which are well done for the era.\n\nWhile I liked the performances from the principals, I confess what brought me to the film was Anna May Wong, who briefly appears (uncredited) as a Singaporean prostitute. The role is unfortunate but typical of those she was relegated to by Hollywood and I wish she had been getting the parts she deserved, but the sassy little flick of her hair while strutting away from a guy hitting on her at roughly 45:15 is one of my favorite moments in her filmography. In the biography he wrote of Wong, Graham Russell Gao Hodges says that preserved stills from the original footage reveal that passionate scenes between Wong and Novarro wound up on the cutting room floor, which is a damn shame (and somewhat surprising, since what we see has her ardor directed at Torrence&apos;s character ... it seems a machete was taken to the action out in Singapore, which may explain the film&apos;s narrative issues). Increasingly upset at these types of parts and unable to get a romantic type leading role because of the taboo against miscegenation, Wong left America the same year to make films in Europe for a few years.\n\nUnfortunately, the film really fades in its final half hour, starting with an unexpected revelation when a repeat visit is made out to Singapore. Without spoiling it, I will just say it&apos;s an unfair turn of events because it defies what we&apos;ve seen and been told before, and the characters then continue on without surprise or explanation. The film starts lagging and gets highly melodramatic in a fight sequence that&apos;s tiresome by the time we get around to it. It&apos;s a little unfortunate the script and storytelling didn&apos;t match the star power here, but it&apos;s worth taking a look.",

      "reviewBody": "A movie about creation and perception, a big paste of shorts films, pictures and misc documents, about cinematographic language as it were in the late 70&apos;s\n\nA foreign secret service put Dominique Auphal (a diplomat) under surveillance in order to find a psychological and/or social weakness in his life to ensure some kind of leverage to control him politically (by blackmailing). His life is analyzed, commented, discussed and rationalized. He&apos;s the File (number) 51.\n\nFirst it can be seen as a view on an omnipresent figure representing oppressive control over individual lives ; a variation on Orwell&apos;s 1984 set in France in the late 70&apos;s describing a society with less privations and overwhelming authority. More realistic though as pessimistic as the novel.\n\nThen it provides keys and show the &apos;everyone&apos;s watching everyone&apos; just born-ed syndrome when secret services agents go on coarse or trivial comments about Auphal&apos;s personal life (&apos;why in hell he&apos;s dating this girl ?&apos; &apos;what kind of twisted guy has this kind of sexual fantasies&apos;..) ; they&apos;re judging him beyond the psychological analysis they have to do and lose partiality. 30 years before &apos;garbage - who&apos;s fu**ing who -&apos; reality TV, Michel Deville discusses about basic viewers pulsion and perversion.\n\nAbout one third of the movie is overdubbed (messy voices-over spoken by secret services agents watching Auphal) footages of Auphal (51 in a street, in a park, at home ; spy cameras, photographs, sound recordings..) we are at heart with empathy. We both follow the POV (perception) of a secret service agent by watching those documents AND due to the fact that this investigation is merciless, so complete and meticulous we&apos;re deeply breaking in Auphal&apos;s life. This is a document produced by this secret service, the whole movie is created by them as it could be shown to an executive who wouldn&apos;t know the case.\n\nDominique Auphal is born during WWII, he was about 25 years old during the 1968 french events with everything that it involves, psychologically ; he&apos;s part of the generation that had no global war to handle, enjoying freedom of social, professional and sexual choices. The movie deserves to be seen just to get a good look on the France of those years..\n\n&quot;His Life&apos;s Facts&quot; are thrown into your face during a hundred minutes : the movie is a list of things, facts, views about this man ; as in Antonioni&apos;s Blow-up (another one charactered movie about photographic and its medium perception), there&apos;s no great deal of action or mystery but the portrait of the loneliness of a man. One is surrounded by models, big money, The Yardbirds and creation during the swinging sixties (lucky lucky) whereas 51 is trapped in a strict and pretty depressing professional life (but a valuable position for other countries to have under control) and his sexual habits...\n\nTechnically, there&apos;s never-seen-before innovations (use of &apos;look through camera&apos;, POV shots, interview footages, jump cuts ; all mixed up) but Le Dossier 51 is also one the most incredible cinematographical portrait ever made, supported by great actors (François Marthouret as 51 and Roger Planchon as Esculape 1), state-of-the-art editing and cinematography.\n\nTo be watched along with : Le Prix du Danger (1983, Y.Boisset), The Conversation (1974, F.F. Coppola), Blow up (1966, M. Antonioni), Blow out (1981, B. De Palma), Je te tiens, tu me tiens par la barbichette (1979, J. Yanne) and everything discussing artistic mediums or/and medias.",

      "reviewBody": "This is Jerry Lewis at his best.Sure I could say the same thing about him in many other movies.The master clown plays this time a bellboy named Stanley Belt.A star comedian dies, so they want to train a nobody, in this case Stan the bellboy, to be the new star.But hiring Stan to fill the shoes of the comedian really isn&apos;t such a good idea.He can&apos;t do anything right and there are so many things he has to do.So many things he has to learn, and there&apos;s not too much time to learn it all.The Patsy (1964): directed by Jerry Lewis, writing credits Jerry Lewis and Bill Richmond.This is a funny comedy with a deeper meaning.Jerry does his comic act with his own unique style, that many have tried to imitate.But let&apos;s face it; nobody is better than the original.Ina Balin is a terrific leading lady.She plays Ellen Betz and is really sweet in her part.Everett Sloane is Caryl Fergusson and he&apos;s marvelous.Phil Harris is great as Chic Wymore.Keenan Wynn is wonderful as Harry Silver.Also his father, Ed Wynn can be seen in the movie.And so can Keenan&apos;s son Ned Wynn.Peter Lorre does his final movie role in The Patsy.He was a great, great actor in both comedies and more serious roles.Scatman Crothers is there to give shine to the shoes.Then there are people you may recognize from other Lewis movies, like Del Moore, Buddy Lester and Nancy Kulp.Some people are there as themselves, like Hedda Hopper, Rhonda Fleming, George Raft, Mel Tormé and Ed Sullivan.Not too many movies have a cast like that! Two of my favorite scenes are where Jerry paints a tuxedo on himself and the flashback sequence showing Jerry as a youngster in a dance where the girls don&apos;t want to dance with him.Those scenes show what a great mime Jerry really is.Here in Finland they have been showing Jerry Lewis movies on Sundays this summer.The last time they showed his movies successively was in 1998.Now I can see the tragedy in Jerry&apos;s characters better than I did back then.Then I saw only the crazy and zany and funny man.Now I can see his characters are often tragic figures who also happen to be very funny.Jerry Lewis can still make me laugh like crazy.Jerry is a fool with heart.Nobody can do it like Jerry Lewis.",

It is amazing in many respects, as usually with the films of Manoel De Oliveira, and absolutely unique. E.g., the communication between Macário and Luísa takes mostly place between windows. Windows as such are compromises, openings of a wall which separate the inside from the outside, in-between-land that belongs to nowhere. Then the story obviously sets in a noble and stylistically rigid society, possibly in the 19th century, in which the novel had been written. But suddenly you see a computer screen and people paying in Euro. While Ricardo Trêpa, nephew of the director, and Leonor Silveira belong to the director&apos;s film-family, Catarina Wallenstein (who has not much to say and nothing special to act) is a true surprise, doubtlessly one of the most beautiful women ever having appeared on the silver screen, yet completely unknown hitherto outside of Portugal.",

The event is witnessed by an ocean hunter, who decides to change his choice of prey to these great beasts. He eventually harpoons one allright, but what he thought would be a simple kill turns out to be something closer to murder! This is a &quot;ONE OF A KIND&quot; movie, that I think delivers &quot;not bad&quot; , for its&apos; time. Unusually, artistic soundtrack. A must see for movie lovers."

She also has a yen for Bow&apos;s Boyfriend, Hall. That&apos;s about it for plot.\n\nCharles Sellon plays the crooked gambler. Jean Harlow has a few lines as the friend and one scene with Bow and Arthur. Harlow and Hall would star in Hell&apos;s Angels a few years after this. Edna May Oliver in her talkie debut plays the head of personnel, and Frank Ross plays Ken. Ross would marry Arthur and become a film producer. And that&apos;s Bess Flowers trying out the reducing machine.\n\nWorth a look for feisty Clara Bow and Jean Arthur in an odd role."

      "name": "Overall enjoyable and well done, a short and straightforward horror-thriller",
      "reviewBody": "I appreciate that this was accordingly conceived as the pilot for a TV show. One had better appreciate it, or else the stylized opening credits and predominant lighthearted music would turn one off right away. Likewise, between Terry Bourke&apos;s direction and Peter Hendry&apos;s cinematography, there were many choices made here in terms of how shots were arranged that were choices of novelty and not of sincere intent; it&apos;s readily evident that the TV program that did not materialize was to have carried a wry, tongue-in-cheek tone even amidst the horror-thriller violence. A bit more plainly questionable is the editing, which carries the same latter sensibility but has the effect of chopping up the viewing experience in a tiresome manner. I could also do without the animal cruelty, a needless, tasteless addition even in a genre that already capitalizes on death and violence. No matter how you want to look at it, &apos;Night of fear&apos; is neither free of issues nor an essential must-see.\n\nThe plot is emphatically straightforward - admittedly in keeping with the slant of the original apparent intent - and the storytelling is so direct and unsophisticated that there&apos;s not necessarily much lasting entertainment value to be had here. In the very least I commend the cast for their committed, intense performances, even if Norman Yemm is a little over the top as the hermit. I will also say that to the credit of filmmaker Bourke, the feature is able to achieve a measure of tense atmosphere. With smart use of sound effects, lighting, and art direction in addition to the acting, some more horror-appropriate themes in the score, and instances of fine scene writing, all the key ingredients are in place for a dash of suspense; say what one will of the man&apos;s direction, he&apos;s capable enough to judiciously exercise those advantages. Furthermore, it&apos;s noteworthy that Bourke doesn&apos;t bog down the abbreviated tale with extraneous dialogue; save for some passing instances of verbalized exclamations, &apos;Night of fear&apos; sagely frees itself of words that sometimes just get in the way. Off the top of my head I can think of few genre flicks - or sound pictures generally - that adopted such an approach, and I admire the welcome change of pace.\n\nIn fairness to cinematographer Hendry and editor Ray Alchin, their contributions also lend to the harrowing air about the film despite the most overzealous instances. While these fifty-odd minutes are brief and forthright, they nevertheless evoke earnest feelings of horror for as dark and grisly as the story gets before all is said and done. What it really comes down to is that the production quite comes off as the audiovisual equivalent of a short story, the sort one might find in &apos;Scary stories to tell in the dark&apos; or other such collections; nevermind television - Bourke may well have collaborated on an anthology movie with contemporaries, and &apos;Night of fear&apos; would have fit right in. For those who appreciate all the places the genre can go, whatever form that might take, this will be modestly satisfying. It&apos;s no zenith of thrills of ambience, but it&apos;s suitably enjoyable in its grimness, and for as short as it is, it&apos;s readily digestible for something light and quick. Don&apos;t go out of your way, but &apos;Night of fear&apos; is a fine little piece if you come across it, and that&apos;s all it needs to be.",

Sony Pictures had a better plot for this Jean-Claude Van Damme film. It&apos;s not original, but it is more down to earth and interesting. The hero is Philippe Sauvage, an American veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAfter some VA hospital recovery from the psychological effects of the war, Philippe joins a former sergeant for a private job of guarding a celebrity. He is the reigning heavyweight champion and a philanthropist. But Wayne Barclay, played by Razaaq Adoti, has one particular enemy who would like to see him dead. And when Terrell Singletery gets out of prison early, the fireworks start.\n\n&quot;The Hard Corps&quot; isn&apos;t a good film, but it is fair. Philippe&apos;s buddy gets killed early on, and he is hired to run the protection. So, he brings in some more veterans with experience. But Barclay wants some of his buddies from his gym as bodyguards as well. The two forces mix and the vets train the others.\n\nThis has some good scenes and is refreshing in that it isn&apos;t constant machine gun firing back and forth. There are some lulls when the cast get chances to try to act. It&apos;s an improvement over some of his last films, but the violence and flashes of partial nudity make these films not suitable, or enjoyable for many.",

Like the whole movie. While the first three movies had a sort of coherent storyline - this seems to be on a different playing field.\n\nThere is quite a bit of nudity and the new Emmanuelle is quite pretty. All the Emmanuelles can be considered beautiful to say the least. Unfortunately that does not change a thing when it comes to the ... movie and its plot if you can call it that. There are a few more steamy scenes than in Part 3 ... but that made more sense when it came to character and other developments ... still if the movies got worse and worse ... but still made money, I should be glad the box set I aquired only has the first 4 movies in it. I would have watched all of them - I still might. But I am not getting ... my hopes up (stop snickering ... maybe)",

      "reviewBody": "During World War II, American paratrooper John Kerr (as Gregory &quot;Greg&quot; Wendell) arrives in London on a 48-hour pass. Making his way out to find female companionship, Mr. Kerr collides with pretty French ballerina Leslie Caron (as Gaby). He is smitten. She is not. After watching her dance, Mr. Kerr visits Ms. Caron backstage. She gradually becomes interested and they begin a whirlwind romance. They want to consummate, but are unable to get married due to their alien status. Caron decides to &quot;save herself&quot; (like they used to say) while he goes back into battle. Alas, he&apos;s reported dead. Feeling bad about not giving Kerr something to remember, Caron decides to give it up for other soldiers...\n\nIt turns out the news about Kerr wasn&apos;t exactly accurate...\n\n&quot;Gaby&quot; has been criticized for sanitizing the opening status of Caron&apos;s character and altering the original ending of Robert E. Sherwood&apos;s play &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1930), which previously impressed film critics in versions starring Mae Clarke (1931) and Vivien Leigh (1940). However, the important alteration is in timing; note, the explicit exchange where Caron ends with, &quot;Not a man, GregMEN!&quot; The problem, this time, is that Caron shows little degradation during this period; she appears chic and confident, throughout. The different ending, while not as memorable, can be applauded for not punishing &quot;Gaby&quot; for her perceived &quot;sinful&quot; behavior. The revisions aren&apos;t as bad, as they seem...\n\nPossibly restrained by the production values, director Curtis Bernhardt is unable to give the story enough intimacy...\n\nCaron could have shown some interest in Kerr during their first encounters, and still been standoffish. They&apos;re supposed to be drawn to each other, as if they were destined to meet. This is touched upon in a scene hinting at reincarnation. The reincarnation mention may have also been included to support MGM&apos;s use of &quot;Where or When&quot; (by Rogers and Hart) as the film&apos;s theme. The timeless song is used well. Another revision is having Kerr sustain a symbolic wound; yet, it is another addition which doesn&apos;t fully take full advantage of the dramatic opportunities. Veteran stage actress Margalo Gillmore (as Helen Carrington) has a couple of outstanding scenes. In spite of all, the co-stars are a nice couple.\n\n****** Gaby (5/9/56) Curtis Bernhardt ~ Leslie Caron, John Kerr, Taina Elg, Margalo Gillmore",

      "reviewBody": "STORY: Fracture manages to succeed where other films like it have failed spectacularly many times over. Ted Crawford shoots his adulterous wife in the head and waits calmly for the police to arrive. He had the gun in his hand and made a signed confession. On the other side is a slick lawyer who has finally made his big break into corporate law, this is his final case and it very well could be the one that breaks him when he realises that there is actually no evidence to convict Crawford. The film creates an ingenious plot that, while slow in parts, keeps you guessing until the very end. Character development was this film&apos;s strongest aspect. The only issue was the lack of progression in some parts where some pointless padding techniques were used rather than advance the plot. 3.5/5\n\nEXECUTION: As seen in films such as Silence of The Lambs, Anthony Hopkins is spectacular as the ingenious sociopathic antagonist that you just have to love. Similarly Ryan Gosling portrays the arrogant lawyer trying to rush through his last case and leave it behind. Most of the supporting cast are good enough to hold their own. There is no real action in this film but it doesn&apos;t need it due to the clever directing and style that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last few minutes. 4.5/5\n\nVERDICT: Overall a good film with very few flaws. Best of all no clichéd &quot;hero and bad guy&quot; and no ridiculous Hollywood action or effects. This film relies on the talent of the actors and they do not disappoint. Give the film a fair trial and give it a chance to prove how good it can be. 3.5 + 4.5 = 8/10",

      "name": "Herzog&apos;s ultimate statement about the perseverance of the human spirit",
      "reviewBody": "One of the most evocative and quietly moving films ever produced on the subjects of cultural displacement, exploitation and personal despair, with director Werner Herzog producing a pure work of cinema as sensitive as the character that he depicts. With this particular film, Herzog created perhaps the ultimate statement about the perseverance of the human spirit, whilst simultaneously creating a world that is deliberately abstracted in order to convey the perspective of a character out of step with society and the period that embraced him. Like many of Herzog&apos;s films from this era, such as Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970) and Stroszek (1977) in particular, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1975) is essentially about looking at the world from the outside in; with all of the separate elements distorted in order to convey the world-view of this perennial outsider seeing himself for the very first time. In a manner similar to that of David Lynch&apos;s subsequent film, The Elephant Man (1980), Herzog uses elements of the real-life story behind the character simply as an excuse to ruminate on the notions of alienation, the nature of conspiracy, personal exploitation and degradation, as well as the often underhanded mechanisms of a seemingly enlightened society, in a way that goes beyond the mere superficial levels of the narrative.\n\nThe point of the film is expressed by the original German title, &quot;Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle&quot;, or &quot;every man for himself and God against all&quot;. In keeping with this, the nature of religion is brought up twice in the film and dismissed on both occasions by the central character, who claims to be too unfamiliar with the concept of spirituality to be able to make an informed opinion. The church argues that Kaspar should believe simply as an act of blind faith and that a leap of faith will overcome any such notions of knowledge or conception. It is a keen comment on the part of Herzog and one that ties into the idea of Kaspar as an unspoiled being; an almost childlike figure, though in the possession of a keen intelligence and a passionate creative spirit, who ultimately finds himself persecuted for reasons that neither he nor we could ever truly comprehend. In the hands of any other filmmaker, the depiction of Kaspar would have no doubt been that of the traditional outcast; desperately trying to find their own identity in the form of a triumph over adversity. However - again looking back to the subject matter of Even Dwarfs Started Small - Herzog instead gives us a representation of the sane man in the insane world; showing us how the corruption and inherent evil of self-preservation can take a gentle and contemplative spirit and crush it completely; a notion that is beautifully illustrated in a cinematic sense by the scene in which Kaspar sows his name with seeds into the flower bed, only to return one day from an outing to find that it has been trampled by an intruder.\n\nMoments like these are characteristic of Herzog&apos;s continually fascinating style of direction from this particular period, as he approached cinema from a perspective similar to that of filmmakers like Peter Watkins, Ken Russell or Pier Paolo Pasolini by investigating the workings of a period setting from a more contemporary perspective. So, we have the authentic costumes, locations and an attempt to recreate the values and mannerisms of this particular society, all the while being abstracted by Herzog&apos;s continually probing camera that lingers and explores - often hand-held - through the various cobbled back-streets and stately homes from where the drama plays out. Herzog has often claimed that there is (or was) no real distinction between his documentary work and his more cinematic features, with both particular examples coming from the same place and attempting to convey what Herzog refers to as &quot;the ecstatic truth&quot;. You can see this ideology clearly with the film, as the director mixes a non-actor in the shape of Bruno S. alongside professional performers like Walter Ladengast and Brigitte Mira. As a result of this, there is a heightened quality to the portrayal of Kaspar, as well as a genuine sense of dependence on the two characters that come to care for him, as the more experienced cast members take Bruno under their wing and coach him along in a manner reminiscent of the actual characters themselves.\n\nThe juxtaposition between the two styles of documentary realism and purposeful cinematic expression can be seen in the visualisation of the film; from the naturalistic cinematography of Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein - with its emphasis on light and shadow and expressive use of landscapes - to the use of classical music (which here gives the film a yearning, almost romantic sense of melodrama to contrast against the more downbeat elements of the film). From its stark and impressionistic opening vignette - with its allusions to a dreamlike evocation somewhat removed from the rest of the film - to the beguiling fever-dream of caravans moving through a barren desert as the film reaches its close, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser is an absolute masterpiece from a director here at the very top of his creative peak. It is without question unlike any other film you will ever see; one that is rich in character and a believable evocation of period detail, but one that also presents a genuinely unique and unforgettable cinematic vision. In Herzog&apos;s film, it is the world that is wrong and confused, with Kaspar becoming a sort of representation for the very greatest qualities of humanity in the face of this vile corruption. A powerful and emotive concept as passionately realised as the film itself."

When Rebecca Brown (Mia Serafino) that is the sister of his former girlfriend Elizabeth Brown (Sarah Habel) that was murdered a couple of years ago pays a visit to him, she tells that she has just found Elizabeth&apos;s journal with evidences that Lonnie Flennons (Richard Wilkinson), who was accused for the murder, is innocent. Sam decides to witness the murder of Elizabeth and his interference affects the future. He travels to the past other times trying to fix his mistakes, but every time he returns, the future is in worse condition. \n\n&quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations&quot; is flawed but entertaining, but is not a sequel of the two first movies. The only thing in common is that the lead character can travel to the past and every time that he wants to fix and event, he messes up the future. The story has many inconsistencies and paradoxes and is not difficult to predict the conclusion. The IMDb User Rating is very fair in the evaluation of this movie. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Efeito Borboleta: Revelação&quot; (&quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelation&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "... Madame X, Giant, and War and Peace, except Russia and Napoleon have nothing to do with it.\n\nPlot wise it is no great shakes. In 19th century Britain, a fun loving young woman (Ann Harding as Lady Isabella) marries wealthy barrister Robert Carlyle (Conrad Nagel). He sweeps her off her feet and is quite the romantic. But when the two return to his ancestral home of East Lynne, everything changes. Robert&apos;s humorless old maid sister, Cecelia, doesn&apos;t like Isabella, she has always overseen the household and has no intention of giving that job up (this is where it is like Giant), and pretty much makes Isabella a guest in her own home. And also Robert is gone on business all of the time, and when he IS home spends his time chastising Isabella over not being dignified enough.\n\nLet&apos;s just cut matters short and say that the first time that Isabella&apos;s foot even comes close to slipping, Cecelia witnesses only part of it, fills in the blanks with things that would have never happened to her at any age, and is believed by Robert over Isabella. She is turned out and kept from her child. Isabella becomes a scandal in England and thus she leaves and goes to Europe where she is not known. Things go downhill for her first financially, then physically, and ultimately she is told she is going blind. Excuse me, but isn&apos;t this beginning to sound like a Constance Bennett film from the same era? But I digress.\n\nShe travels back to England to see her son one more time before she goes blind. She is in her son&apos;s sick room when the film hits the missing reel. All I can say is about half a dozen unbelievable melodrama tropes hit in that last twelve minutes. But one of them is not, unfortunately, Robert and Cecelia being hit by a meteor. That would be a satisfying ending.\n\nThe acting here is what is really good and overcomes the tired material. Harding was always excellent, but Clive Brook was always playing the stodgy character over at Paramount in the early talkie years. Here he is given a meaty role of somebody I like, love, and hate, depending on where the storyline is. Conrad Nagel, who doesn&apos;t have too much screen time, plays his role like the unlikeable implacable descendant of Puritans that his character is. If he is indeed &quot;10th generation Puritan&quot; as Isabella&apos;s dad says, I wonder why his ancestors didn&apos;t leave England with the others on the Mayflower? If Robert&apos;s relatives are anything like him, his ancestors were probably such kill joys that the other Puritans gave his relatives the wrong day and the wrong ship so they wouldn&apos;t be stuck on a sea journey with them.\n\nEast Lynne was nominated for only one Academy award - Best Picture. It was a year of weak nominees but not weak films. East Lynne was up against Skippy, Trader Horn, The Front Page, and winner Cimarron, which today is one of the more ponderous Best Picture decisions. The acting definitely makes this film, and is the reason to watch it if it ever comes your way.",

Plus, it&apos;s got Mr. Scatman Crothers- how can you go wrong?? Definitely worth a rental, especially for fans of low-budget horror films of the early 80s."

I&apos;m into musicals and romances, which was probably why I adore this film and is the best. The performances were phenomenal, but that is no surprise coming from stars such as Shah Rukh Khan who is the &apos;Baadshah&apos; of Bollywood (plus i recommend you watch Veer-Zaara - that film I think surpasses this one in some scenes). Madhuri Dixit had come back again in this film after Hum Aapke Hain Kaun... and to me she is the best dancer and actress I have ever seen in Bollywood. Karisma Kapoor was exceptional as Nisha in the film and I think no one else could have done her role better as the modern Indian girl - though now it is seen in practically all Yash Raj films (e.g. Mujhse Dosti Karogi). Watch the film and hopefully you&apos;ll love it as much as me.",

      "reviewBody": "We stuck our heads in this movie because we had 15 minutes to kill before our movie started (&quot;Collateral&quot;). Surprise of surprises, we were glued to our seats and didn&apos;t want to leave! We&apos;re NOT 20-somethings or even 30-somethings, yet we found this entire movie eye-watering funny! These two actors are great at their craft, and their on-screen combination a perfect match. Our only regret is that we can&apos;t take our 14-year-old son to see it--the movie makes light of drugs and sex too much for his age (in our &quot;parental opinion&quot;). However, it&apos;s no worse in that regard than South Park or other hit movies involving college-age adults (a la Animal House). In fact, it has many more redeeming qualities than AH. Specifically speaking, the not-so-subtle (and rightfully so) social commentary. We hope that part isn&apos;t lost in the incredible humor. We HIGHLY recommend this movie to those of you who enjoy movies like There&apos;s Something About Mary, Four Rooms (&quot;Misbehavers&quot; vignette), etc. Favorite scenes: two sorority types in the restroom and the two African American men in the jail house!"

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. The announcement stated a bold reference to Blow Up (Antonioni; 1966). In the first hour the story seemed to go in a similar direction. An amateur photographer was paid to follow a woman walking in the park with her baby, and to mail the shots taken to her husband. The daily walks looked very innocent, but we were obviously led to believe that there was more to it. In the mean time we witnessed several small events in the personal life of the photographer, evenly spread out in time. None of these offered a clue what the film was all about. But a lot can happen in the 2 hours that this film was planned to take.\n\nEven after 1 hour (halfway) still nothing like a plot emerged. But I saw no significant walkouts from a venue with 250 booked seats. I assumed to have missed something important that was obvious to everyone else, otherwise not so many people could be that patient for that length of time.\n\nThe series of small events continued, introducing a dead brother, a hospitalized mother, a possible love affair with a step sister, and a pattern in the locations where the shadowed woman took her walks. Still hoping that some plot was to be grown out of all these openings, I stayed until the end. It proved a disappointment, after all. I can merely wonder what the director of this film had thought to show us with all this emptiness. The only thing left for me was giving a 1 (lowest) mark for the public prize competition when leaving the theater."

      "reviewBody": "If the reality presented in this documentary is too much for some reviewers, that&apos;s too bad. Thankfully for the rest of us this is an incredibly well made, thoughtful documentary for people with enough maturity to realize that while not everything in life can be glowsticks and glitter, that doesn&apos;t make it any less worth living.\n\nThis documentary shows a lot of different sides of gay life through telling the story of several different gay bars in the &quot;Bible belt,&quot; both hardships and the joys. Describing this movie as depressing (and deeming it unfit to see because of it) seems short- sighted in the extreme.\n\nThere are a lot of depressing moments. Any time Phelps gets any screen time it is dismaying, but he&apos;s a great figure to use to show the very extreme of anti-gay movements. If every queen is out getting blissed out of their mind and ignoring hate mongers like Phelps, his numbers only grow stronger. Know thy enemy. The filmmakers clearly juxtapose Phelps and his followers with the simple, sweet sentiments of the brother of a slain gay man. I think it was quite powerful.\n\nAnd if anything, I think the film has a message of hope. Despite all the trials, the gay bars in little town are still sticking it out thanks to a few brave individuals, with arguably more heart and sense of community their well coiffed city counterparts can muster these days.\\\n\nThe film does suffer a bit when it tries to tell the story of &quot;Tula&apos;s&quot; mostly because it explores it with less depth than Crossroads or Rumors and it feels a bit tacked on, even though some of the info it offered is interesting, especially in relation to the AFA. But that&apos;s my only real complaint.\n\nAs a young gay man, I found this movie inspiring. These people are the pioneers in the wild wild west of an oppressively straight (and yes, sometimes cruel) world. It&apos;s not safe for them, it&apos;s not easy - but they&apos;re finding their moments of joy and a place to belong without running away from the places they grew up.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to wonder - why stay? That&apos;s like asking a family in a bad neighborhood - why stay? If there are drug dealers at every corner and bullets flying through the window why do you stay? The truth is, it&apos;s not always easy to leave for a number of complicated reasons. There&apos;s economics, family, affection for a certain town or landscape... or a mixture of all of them. Should every LGBTQ person flee to a big city, protected in a gay ghetto bubble without having to worry about what is happening in the other 90% of the country? I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;d never begrudge them for doing so, as almost every person in the homosexual community has had their fair share of knocks. But to write those who chose to stay off as stupid or miserabilists is unfair in the extreme.\n\nI think they&apos;re heroes to be applauded, and I applaud the filmmakers for shining a light on them.",

      "reviewBody": "In Bordeaux, the pediatric doctor Stéphane (Jean-Hugues Anglade) is a wolf, flirting with many beautiful women. One night, he meets the twelve year-old Eva (Julia Maraval) alone in front of his building and she tells that she had lost her train to Strasburg. Stéphane invites her to spend the night in his apartment and on the next morning, he takes her to the police station. However the girl tells a story about her stepmother and vanishes. Sooner Stéphane discovers that Eva, who is great pianist, was his patient in his father&apos;s hospital where he works when she was six and lost her father. Further, she is treating an angioma in her brain and she will be blind if submitted to a surgery. The girl refuses to be fed in the hospital and her grandfather brings her to Stéphane&apos;s home to get close to him. Stéphane feels a platonic affection for the girl and researches the healing for her angioma. He discovers that the retired doctor Arnaud (Jean-François Stévenin) had written a thesis with a revolutionary treatment. Meanwhile he has conflictive feelings for her considering their difference of ages.\n\nI saw &quot;Dis-moi oui...&quot; for the first time on 19 December 1999 on VHS released by Lumiere Distributor and I found one of the most delightful romances I have ever watched. Today I have seen this pleasant movie again and I do not understand why this wonderful film has not been released on DVD in Brazil. Further, there are only 130 votes in IMDb meaning that the worldwide distribution is limited. The story is very beautiful, and the awesome chemistry between the sweet Julia Maraval and Jean-Hugues Anglade is something very special. I regret that I have not seen any other movie of the talented and gorgeous Julia Maraval or Nadia Farès in Brazil. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Diga-me Sim&quot; (&quot;Tell me Yes&quot;)\n\nNote: On 28 February 2017, i saw this lovely film again.\n\nNote: On 16 December 2022, i saw this lovely film again.\n\nNote: On 10 October 2023, i saw this lovely film again.",

This film is a love letter to the great Lucha classics of the Sixties and Seventies, and a fan&apos;s wish list come to life. Practically every scene is an homage to a trope from the classics. You get an Aztec Mummy, shambling Momias, wrestler vs monster scenes, plenty of ring action, sultry Aztec cult dancer, superhero wrestler HQ, some light bondage, blood and body-slams! And there are cameos from the modern legend legacy wrestlers like Hijo del Santo and Blue Demon Jr among others. You can keep your hyperactive CGI flash-cut action scenes! Give me a pack of masked wrestlers lumbering into battle with the Undead any day! The movie suffers a little from some loose editing and pacing issues. The acting ranges from quite good to, well, not so quite. I sometimes get the feeling that the screenplay looked perfect on paper, but the execution struggles to keep up with it in places. Still, the film never fails to entertain and is a heartfelt homage to a bygone classic genre, starring one of the greatest legends of that genre! How can you go wrong with that? I&apos;m looking forward eagerly to more Lucha Cine action to come!"

This film is so completely different than the ones mentioned above. I think Truffaut shows us his inner-self by playing the role of Julien Davenne, a journalist obsessed with the idea of building an altar for his dead. The audience gets a direct access to his feelings and thoughts about life and death. This film is a chance to understand Truffaut and his work better. He knew that the film would not be a box-office hit, but that was not important to Truffaut. He liked the short-stories by Henry James and just did what he wanted to. In my opinion Truffaut did a beautiful job by making this film. I think this film demands very much from its viewers. &quot;The Green Room&quot; provokes a self-reflection in the viewer. The viewer has to deal with his own attitude towards life and death. So this is not an easy film to watch. But if you want a film that differs from all the high-tech, action-loaded movies of the present that simultaneously gives you a very personal access to the man who made it, &quot;The Green Room&quot; is a good choice.",

Raj Kapoor was the ultimate Showman film maker India saw and probably the most popular Indian film star internationally across continents and languages.\n\nSomehow I couldn&apos;t relate to Raj Kapoors style of acting in many films and it was only later that I started appreciating his cinema. In his later innings post Sangam however none of the films did that well as an actor. However, I would like to mention that in his later films ,Sanjay Khans ABDULLAH -1980 stands out for me.\n\nThe film is an epic desert saga set in Arab world and Raj Saab plays the title role very well.\n\nSanjay Abbas Khan was a great admirer of Raj Sahib and after the brief appearance in his Chandi Sona he signed the showman as lead here. Abdullah is a simple,pious Muslim who has a well,talks to camel and extremely soft spoken. He raises the Hindu child Krishna and saves him from evil bandits. The role was tailor made and Raj Saab nailed it so well that the pious Arab character we read in poems like Abou Ben Adham came alive infront of me.\n\nHis scenes with the kid,with Sanjay and how he talks to his camels are heart warming. His brutal torcher at hand of evil Danny is heart wrenching and seems like a prequel of the infamous Ghatak scene wherein again Danny torchers an old Amrish Puri. Another aspect of Abdullah is that Kapoor Saab shared screen with Mehmood after 22 years of their Parvarish post which there were rumors of some tensions between the two. Here they have great chemistry though.\n\nA grand enjoyable action saga where Raj Saab delivers an ace and a film which needs to be seen much more than it is discussed for the fights between Sanjay-Zeenat after it&apos;s release! The film is a pioneer of grand action films set in Arab and later fims like Sultanat, and then Palay Khan and Khuda Gawah (set in Afghanistan though) carried this genre. I am sure Raj Kapoor fans will not be disappointed seeing his heart warming act!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Hollywood produces hundreds of action/cartoon/fantasy films each year. Look closely and you&apos;ll see they all mimic each other. Redundency is key in Hollywood. However if you seek a thinking film, which reaches into your every day life, look to Foreign Films. Here is one called &quot; Amor Estranho Amor. &quot; Roughly translated it means, &apos;Love, Strange Love. &apos; It&apos;s the story of a man, Hugo (adult - Walter Forster) who&apos;s returning to the family home he lived in when he was a very young Brazilian preteen boy growing up amid the governmental turmoil of the 1930&apos;s. Having been evicted by his Grandmother, he is taken to live in his mother&apos;s house, a glamorous, socially exclusive, high class Bordello. While there, Hugo as a child (Marcelo Ribeiro) recalls the two days he spent with his prostitute mother and a bevy of beautiful whores. While a group of political radicals plan the over throw of the government, Hugo is treated to the eye-popping candy delights of his youthful imagination, while his mother warns him of those same pleasures. The movie is stylish, often opulent with respects to the lavish settings, the gorgeous women and most startling with the innocent beauty of the boy and his mother. However, the stagnant dialog and poor acting of the principals leaves much to be desired. Although there is much controversy over the inter-action between the young boy and the lascivious courtesans, there is nothing in the movie to be feared by any save those who lack sophistication. As for those mature enough to accept this masterful art piece for what it is, the writer/director Walter Khouri, his cast Xuxa Meneghel, Tarcisio Meira and Vera Fishcher are to be praised as they have given the world a foreign Classic. Well done. *****",

For the living the list of these events runs from the sinking of the Titanic to the destruction of the World Trade Center.  For my generation it is a cascade of events that begins with JFK&apos;s assassination.  Nov 22, 1963 we were in school, heard the news and rushed home to watch events unfold on television.\n\nIn this time travel story JFK doesn&apos;t die, he learns that his philandering will ruin his image and stops, he turns the Cold War driven space race into an international project and stops the escalation of US involvement in Viet Nam --thus saving 57,000 lives.\n\nI&apos;d have to agree with others that the story telling here needs work. The order in which we see events doesn&apos;t convey the story arc all that well. Production values are low, there&apos;s gratuitous use of course language which, while all too common now, was alien then.  As for the nudity: well, it was something to see Marilyn Monroe reproduce one of her most famous poses for JFK.  I won&apos;t quibble about that.\n\nMy generation has the images of that weekend burned into our consciousness. In this story the Zapruder film, taken on the &quot;Grassy Knoll,&quot; doesn&apos;t show the top of JFK&apos;s head being blown off.  In this story Walter Cronkite&apos;s first announcement of something going in the President&apos;s motorcade doesn&apos;t end with him saying that JFK is dead. (Note: those of us in school didn&apos;t see it live, but we&apos;ve lived with the taped images ever since.) And, finally, the event that takes place in Parkland Hospital (just outside Dallas) is joyous.  It&apos;s not the end of a Presidency that had begun to capture the enthusiasm of a generation with it&apos;s New Frontier and Peace Corps, but a celebration of something new.\n\nFor it&apos;s many flaws this film shows some beautiful healing images."

So, remember that in those days, you didn&apos;t know what the preview would be until the film started rolling in the movie theater, and if my memory serves me correct, it was given a sneak preview in Minneapolis, and after the first half played, everyone screamed, clapped and whistled, and after the second half it sounded like the roof of theater was caving in because of the positive response, so Fox said, &quot;Now wait a minute! Maybe we&apos;ve got something here that we&apos;re not aware of, so they released The Sound of Music nationwide on a Reserve Seat basis, and when the critics saw it, they all reported that it would put everyone in a diabetic comma and would last a year, but they were wrong, and the rest is history! O.K., so &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; is not The Sound of Music! Big deal! So, The Sound of Music was just about playing out its 3 year run in most theaters, and as usual, someone in Hollywood says, &quot;Let&apos;s cash in on the popularity of the movie and do our own musical about a bunch of Nuns, and Metro Goldwyn Mayers effort was &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; with Jewish convert Debbie Reynolds playing a Nun; that sings as well as Debbie Reynolds, and in all fairness, the movie might not be what the big boys at M.G.M. wanted, but it gave Debbie Reynolds the chance to do her finest singing ever! Her vocals in the movie, as far as I&apos;m concerned, are superb! So, what about the cast and the film itself. Here&apos;s Greer Garson at the end of her career, Marshall Thompson, at the end of his, Ricardo Montalban famous for swimming with Esther Williams in her swimming musicals, Agnes Moorehead still looking like she&apos;d like to cast a nasty on Darrin in Bewitched, and Chad Everett still looking like Doctor Gannon who claimed more animism&apos;s in his hospital T.V. show than would ever see on T.V. Soap General Hospital or Greay&apos;s Anatomy! The Singing Nun is not a good movie, but it&apos;s not a bad one either, and in ways it&apos;s very entertaining, but once again, it does afford Debbie Reynolds to do her finest singing ever in any of her films! Her singing in The Singing Nun is superb and spiritually uplifting, and fulfilling!",

      "reviewBody": "There was a time, in the early 1920s and 1930s, that Maxwell Anderson was considered a great modern American dramatist.  His plays were considered the modern equivalent of Shakespeare or Marlowe or Jonson.  This was because he wrote in blank verse.  Many of his plays were turned into films, such as WINTERSET and MARY OF SCOTLAND. Even as late as the 1970s Brooks Atkinson (in his book BROADWAY) lauded Anderson to the skies.  \n\nIn retrospect, one wonders why the praise.  Probably because we have not produced many great serious dramatists.  I imagine that five names might be pushed at the present: O&apos;Neill, Miller, Williams, Albee, and Inge.  Anderson is not revived.  His use of blank verse, so impressive to Atkinson, seems pretentious to us.  That and his stiff characterizations are major roadblocks to enjoying his work.\n\nBut he was flying high in 1939, when Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for ELIZABETH THE QUEEN for Bette Davis at Davis&apos; urging.  But she wanted Lawrence Olivier for Essex, and was given Errol Flynn, an actor she did not like to work with.  Further, the title was changed (probably based on the Charles Laughton film THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII) to THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX.  Actually the original title is better and it is as ELIZABETH THE QUEEN that the film is remembered.\n\nThe finished film is actually a good historical work - basically taking the story of Elizabeth I and her last favorite to it&apos;s tragic conclusion.  Flynn does capture the emotional instability of Essex, who chafed at being in his position of power only because he was the boy-toy of an aging, decrepit monarch.  The play/movie makes the affection of the two real, but the actual reality suggests that Essex was more of a male chauvenist than he dared show until the very end.  He was in contact with James VI of Scotland (the son of Elizabeth&apos;s dead rival Mary, Queen of Scots) about the coming change in regime.  This is not covered in the film (and to be fair, Essex&apos;s rival Robert Cecil (Henry Daniell) was also in contact with James VI).\n\nThe achilles heel of Essex is his desire for glory, and what is fascinating in the film is how everyone plays on his weakness. Elizabeth tries to protect him from his follies, by giving him a high ranking title to keep him in London.  But Cecil, his father Lord Burghley (Henry Stephenson), his rival Raleigh (Vincent Price) manage to goad him into leading an army in that permanent quagmire of Ireland. Finally his enemy Tyrone (Alan Hale Sr.) goads him (when he has been beaten) into returning to London and straightening out Elizabeth.  Essex does do so. In real history, his men were defeated in the streets of London.  In the film he does seize the palace, only to be manipulated by Elizabeth into disarming, and then is arrested for treason.  \n\nI don&apos;t think Elizabeth actually gave Essex a ring to return to her if he ever needed her help, but his death in 1601 on the headman&apos;s block at the Tower of London may have shortened her life.  She died in 1603, still Elizabeth the Queen, but also a sad, lonely old woman."

      "reviewBody": "A bleak and uncompromising straight-laced minor b-grade apocalyptic sci-fi survival tale that&apos;s crudely made, but is grippingly constructed (despite a heavy-handed script and typically projected characters) and with committed acting led by the likes of a hardened Nigel Davenport, exuberant Jean Wallace and an unforgettably concentrated Anthony May.\n\nJohn Custance, his family and friend decide to leave London to stay at his brother&apos;s farm in the Lake District, as just like the rest of the world Britain is plagued by a destructive virus caused by pollution that&apos;s destroying earth&apos;s crops and causing unstoppable panic. On their journey they pick up another couple Pirrie and Clara, but also come across a lot of obstacles and anarchy that would change the way they see things.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t call it great, as it&apos;s an interestingly uneven production and somewhat cautionary tale that has its moments, but there are some problems evident that stop it being better than what it could have been. The two things that do stand out is the use of quick, fragmented flash forward sequences that take away any real sense of building upon surprises and suspense, to only confuse. Secondly it could have been a little more powerful in it theories of civilised society falling apart, as no one is better than anyone else in their primitive state to keep alive. What it feels like is over-the-top melodramatics and struggles, which aren&apos;t boring or emotionally forced but could have used a bit more weight. However what director Cornel Wilde develops is an effective apocalyptic vision of a dying world of dreary images (dead corpses --- humans and animals, decaying plant life and destruction of civilisation) covering brooding forlorn landscapes. Even what should be a peacefully desolated countryside, still provides looming threats outside the chaotic cities. Strangely moments had me thinking of M. Night Shyamalan&apos;s 2008 eco-thriller &quot;The Happening&quot;. The violence has that exploitative, gritty touch with moments of relentless surges and unsettling intensity. It&apos;s not graphic, but it doesn&apos;t hold out. Wilde does use some odd, if static filming techniques that show its low budget but add to the moodiness, so does the haunting title song. The score can be harrowing when complementing the visuals, but could find it clunky and overdone. The performances are reasonably brought across, even with the black and white shadings.",

      "reviewBody": "In a snowing Paris, six lonely dwellers have their lives entwined while seeking for love: Nicole (Laura Morante) is looking for a three bedroom apartment to move with her fiancé Dan (Lambert Wilson), who is unemployed and has drinking problem. Her middle-aged real estate agent Thierry (André Dussollier) lives with his younger sister Gaëlle (Isabelle Carré) that tells him that party with her girlfriends every night. However Gaëlle indeed spends her nights alone in cafeterias waiting for blind dates that never appear for the encounter. Thierry&apos;s colleague is the pious and repressed Charlotte (Sabine Azéma) that loans a videotape with a musical religious show to him. But in the end, Thierry sees her in an erotic dance and he believes she is sending a sign for to him. Charlotte is nursing during the nights the aggressive and nasty father of the bartender Lionel (Pierre Arditi) that attends Dan every night in his bar.\n\n&quot;Coeurs&quot; is an overrated and pointless tale of loneliness. The cold and snowing Paris is a kind of metaphor to the frustration in the relationship of the uptight characters that are afraid to deliver themselves to their passions. However the hype surrounding this movie increased my disappointment with the melancholic story. The characters are charismatic and likable and it is easy to the viewer to sympathize with them. Nevertheless the gorgeous Isabelle Carré is miscast in the role Gaëlle, since she is younger and younger than her brother and she is so beautiful that I can not understand how she does not succeed in her blind dates. There are good dialogs but the conclusion is too open and frustrating for a 120 minutes running time feature that gives the sensation of &quot;so what?&quot; to the viewer. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Medos Privados em Lugares Públicos&quot; (&quot;Private Fears in Public Spaces&quot;)",

This movie just has nothing and that&apos;s really amazing cause even a blind squirrel gets a nut sometimes. To start with there is really no coherent story line. To follow it up the acting was more like something I would expect to see in a 2 grade elementary play. And for the third strike there weren&apos;t even any decent looking girls to help pass the time. After the first story I was ready to turn it off but instead I went to IMDb.com and saw the good reviews and thought maybe one of the other stories would have some redeeming factors, unfortunately I was wrong if you have already rented this movie quickly burn it.",

The only things you see re Detroit are empty streets, except for the characters&apos; vehicles, of course. And, most of those scenes are in the very early morning hours. The street scenes could be anywhere in the early morning hours, but they make a big deal for it being in Detroit. Go figure. \n\nWith the opening scenes you see who may be the one who is killing all the former undercover cops. So there is no mystery re that. You know who it is. But, the story is in the telling about how Det Sullivan investigates the murders, and it&apos;s okay..well, actually, more like a made-for-TV movie except for the language. \n\nI cannot figure out why Ray Liotta has not received an Oscar.

Not to be too cruel, but this may be the worst Pokémon movie that I have ever seen, even worse than the Hoopa movie.\n\nFor one, the plot is way too straightforward. The Pokémon Keldeo wants to defeat Kyurem (a supposedly evil Pokémon that has done literally nothing wrong towards Keldeo) to prove to his mentors that he&apos;s strong. Anyway, Keldeo loses to Kyurem and ends up getting his mentors frozen, so Keldeo runs off and meets up with Ash and his friends (the main characters), thus leading to an &apos;epic adventure.&apos; Just kidding, it&apos;s actually quite boring.\n\nThe pacing was quite slow, yet frantic at the same time. The whole movie just involves the main characters running, stopping, running, and stopping, with little room to breathe or hear any of the characters personalities, and the action isn&apos;t exciting enough to keep you interested. The voice acting in this movie is dreadful, either the characters are too whiny (like ash and his companion Iris), or don&apos;t even put any effort into their lines, like Kyurem. He sounds like an old, grumpy man who got out of bed at the wrong time, so you can&apos;t even take the main villain seriously. This is some of the most basic dialogue in a movie, that I have ever heard. None of the characters have any charm or personality, they&apos;re just reading a script without adding any oomph, except maybe Ash and a single line from his friend Iris about doors.\n\n&quot;Now aboxcat,&quot; you may be asking, &quot;are there any redeeming factors to this movie you whiny little baby?&quot; Well, I guess Keldeo&apos;s motivation to becoming as strong as his mentors is a tad bit intriguing, but you don&apos;t get enough time to see what they were like in order to become invested.\n\nYou won&apos;t gain much from watching this movie, trust me, just go watch Detective Pikachu, a way more entertaining experience.",

      "name": "Cate Blanchett shines in biographical drama; some fiction added to the events",
      "reviewBody": "Cate Blanchett reprises her role as the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I, and is the film&apos;s greatest highlight. She exudes power, strength and influence in portraying the 16th century monarch. Her commanding presence on the screen really gives the majestic qualities that the real queen certainly had. At the same time, she gives us a personal glance inside the woman&apos;s heart, where she has suppressed from public view an inner vulnerability and melancholy. Elizabeth certainly endured many sorrows, and this portrayal gives us a glance inside the woman&apos;s who carried all this upon her shoulders, and is credited with raising England to prominent status on the world stage.\n\nIn addition to Blanchett, the supporting cast all turn in superior work. The sets, costuming, and period speech are all mastered well, creating a true feel for the era being depicted. Although many of the people and events are real, a few liberties have been taken apparently to spice up the drama. Such fictionalizing probably wasn&apos;t necessary; enough happened during this queen&apos;s rule to make the story interesting without it. One example: the flashy Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed a favorite of the queen, but this movie puts them in a romantic triangle that just gets in the way of other things going on. Also, Raleigh, better known as an explorer, was not the hero in the battle with the Spanish Armada.\n\nBlanchett shines when she delivers the famous speech to the troops on the eve of the Spanish invasion. But even she is burdened by the director&apos;s preoccupation with Elizabeth as a suffering angst-filled woman facing middle-age with less bravery than facing the world&apos;s most powerful fleet at that time. We get endless views of her taking her wig off in secret, and staring at a mirror. The first time this device is used is fine to get the point across of her hopeless situation of never taking a husband (and the slow advance of time having its way), but we see her looking like a shriveled ghost in too many such scenes, and it&apos;s way overdone in this context. Her &quot;real&quot; hair sans the wig looks like an inebriated Edward Scissorhands was her hairdresser, and her pale complexion looks like somebody pasted white-out all over her face.\n\nThose few mistakes notwithstanding, this is a fine biopic with superior acting by Blanchett, and is recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "The original &apos;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&apos; is one of my favourite thrillers of all time, and a very hard movie to top. I&apos;m always sceptical about remakes of classic horror and SF films, but this version by Philip Kaufman is much better than one would expect, and ALMOST as good as the original. I still think Don Siegel&apos;s version is the best because it really evokes small town life in middle America, and that makes the horror and suspense all the more effective. Kaufman transplants the setting to San Francisco and the big city location means it loses its sense of intimacy and community, and instead has more of an alienated urban feel to it. But it&apos;s still an excellent movie, and along with Cronenberg&apos;s &apos;The Fly&apos; and Carpenter&apos;s &apos;The Thing&apos; the most successful remake of a 1950s horror classic to date. What really helps this movie is the cast. Donald Sutherland, one of the 1970s most interesting and intelligent actors, is excellent in the main role, played by Kevin McCarthy in the first film. And the lovely Brooke Adams (&apos;Days Of Heaven&apos;, &apos;The Dead Zone&apos;, &apos;The Unborn&apos;) is first rate as the main female lead, her role being much more substantial than Dan Wynter&apos;s in the original. I&apos;ve had a major crush on Adams ever since I first saw this movie. She is beautiful but goofy and I really thought she was going to be a major star. The supporting cast is excellent, led by the wonderful Jeff Goldblum and &apos;Alien&apos;s Veronica Cartwright, and of course Leonard Nimoy, in his most memorable non-Trek role. Also keep an eye out for cameos by the star and director of the original version (Kevin McCarthy and Don &apos;Dirty Harry&apos; Siegel), and a very brief but eerie one by Robert Duvall! &apos;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&apos; is a superb example of how to remake a horror classic, and is one of the creepiest and most nerve-wracking thrillers of the 1970s. I highly recommend it and the original &apos;Body Snatchers&apos;, they are two of the scariest movies ever made!"

Soon they have to go out from there, and without food, the dream of becoming the president fades out. Her white shoes become useless.\n\nIt seems the whole of the movie is a poem. That a high school girl dreams to become the president is a poem too. Maybe it is the best way to describe the world Noqreh lives in, which is at five in the afternoon, not in the morning.\n\nHow can the country, where just seeing the face of woman is sin, be open to the world? The country which was destroyed and lagged a long way behind the world by men, who are taught as superior creatures than women. Only the belief that God never dies supports them.

The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there. The use of a disjointed &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos; style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I were handing them out.",

      "reviewBody": "Lina Cavalieri (née Natalina Cavalieri) was a famous belle epoque Italian opera singer who was known as the world&apos;s most beautiful woman because of her incomparable beauty and her extreme hourglass figure. Cavalieri&apos;s portrait has been also hugely popularised in many forms by artist Piero Fornasetti and writer Gabriele D&apos;Annunzio dedicated her a copy of his book IlmPiacere. Extremely underrated and unknown by most part of the audience -probably because it is an Italian movie and not from the USA -this film tells Lina&apos;s more or less acurate biography but, far from being a simply biopic, it excels in so many aspects that the movie should deserve a worldwide success. However, it is a hidden gem with lots of interesting points: First of all, miss Lollobrigida cast is a total success. She does a remakable job here: not only plays her role in a very convincing way but also sings her opera parts beautifully (she was trained to be an opera singer when she was very young but had to quit because her family lack of money). In fact, she had refused to play the main role in Italian movie Aida (1953) based on Giuseppe Verdi&apos;s opera because she was required to play the role only, not doing the singing. And so the role went to Sofia Loren. The sword duel with Gina in a D&apos;Artagnan style costume -based in the true duel between Lina and a a theatre actress in Rome- is well done and fun to watch and reminds of Gina&apos;s previous role in Fanfan La Tulipe with Gérard Philipe. Her ultra small cinched waist is comparable to real Cavalieri&apos;s one, that made audiences gasp when she appeared on the stage. Miss Lollobrigida&apos;s leading man in the film is great Italian actor Vittorio Gassman, who has not much to do with his role but match her nicely. One of film&apos;s highlights are indescriptable and breathtakingly beautiful Nino Novarese&apos;s gowns. Miss Lollobrigida looks gorgeous in them. This Italian designer had studied architectural theatral design and had worked in la Scala de Milan previous to work as a fashion designer in many Hollywood movies and winning two academy awards for Cleopatra (1963) and Cromwell (1970). Also, he was nominated by Prince of foxes (1949) and he was recognized internationally for his highly detailed and historically correct fashion designs. In fact, his work in Cleopatra, where he designed most military uniforms and men wardrobe, is clearly different from Cleopatra&apos;s character one, that suffered from an excessively much more &quot;modern&quot; attire (by Irene Sharaff and Renié). Also remarkable is the cast of italian tenor Gino Sinimberghi to play the role of tenor Silvani. He appeared in several films playing opera singers and he is especially remembered for his singer and acting ability in italian operas. Cast also include tenor Mario Del Monaco and Emilio Schuberth (the tailor of the stars, as this italian fashion designer was called). Robert Alda plays the villain, Ann Vernon plays Lina&apos;s friend Carmela. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard with excellent Eastmancolor photography by Mario Bava filming stunning palaces and gardens, this movie brings us all the fastuosity and grandeur of classic cinema at its best. As a curiosity, in the Folies Plastique scene, as appear in the playbill, Lina is supposed to play three theatre tableaux: The Birth of Venus, Cleopatra, beauty of the ancient world and Lina Cavalieri, beauty of the modern world. But sadly Cleopatra&apos;s scene does never appear in the movie although it does in the trailer. Maybe it was cut due to film&apos;s length?",

The direction is insipid and uncinematic, while the performances is amateur hour, with some of the actors seeming to ham it up because they knew what kind of turkey they were cooking in. I am sure it was only made because of the producer&apos;s love for horse racing and gambling.\n\nBut still I enjoyed it! \n\nGreat to see Aussie suburban life from the seventies, and the operation of a racing horse stable. And I&apos;m glad they used actual jockeys, race callers and other local Melbourne horse racing identities of that era, because it gave it an authentic feel to it, something I wished they had done for the whole film. If only they created a kind of neorealism film of the horse racing industry! Instead they went for the TV soapie style that delivered pure campy elements to a predictable story. \n\nThe highlight was Mark Holden&apos;s surprising performance, showing that he had some natural talent. And the other was the unintentional hysterical scenes of Mrs. G, who really made a real meal of caricaturing an Italian mamma.\n\nStill worth a watch for the horsey lover, who will notice that this film is the pioneering source of the horse whispering method... Only kidding! But it almost grasped the concept of natural horsemanship.",

      "reviewBody": "Happy-Go-Lucky has been reviewed in the British press as a relatively lightweight Mike Leigh movie, but I&apos;m not so sure. The story revolves around Sally Hawkins&apos; remarkable performance as primary school teacher Poppy Cross, a highly unusual character in that Hawkins and Leigh between them manage to make her consistently cheerful and optimistic without being either naive or irritating. Poppy is presented as both relentlessly cheery and, on another level, remarkably intuitive; throughout the film, she has a series of encounters with troubled male figures (a boy in her class who has started bullying, a very strange homeless Irishman and, above all, her phenomenally uptight driving instructor Scott) and in all of them, Poppy&apos;s liveliness and friendly curiosity about other people is seen to be a powerful counter to male self-pity, anger and despair.\n\nHawkins&apos; character is not someone who is inclined to let life get her down, so it&apos;s just as well that she is surrounded by people with a somewhat more sardonic or downbeat take on reality. Her flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, very good) is a wonderfully dry and sarky counter to Poppy&apos;s enthusiasm, although the affection between them is palpable. Poppy&apos;s younger sisters Suzy and Helen are also quite different; Suzy is a law student who is more interested in clubbing, drinking and playing with her brother-in-law&apos;s Playstation than in criminal justice, while Helen is heavily pregnant, obsessed with acquiring the trappings of a respectable suburban life and unable to understand how her older sister can be so happy living in a rented flat and not stepping onto the property ladder.\n\nThe big surprise for me is that I had been led to believe that this is a more or less straightforward feelgood film. It isn&apos;t. Scott, Poppy&apos;s driving teacher (Eddie Marsan), is the most affecting character in it, and one of the greatest and most unforgettable characters in Leigh&apos;s oeuvre. Most of the reviews I&apos;ve read of the film depict Scott as a hateful, sinister or otherwise despicable character, but although it&apos;s true that he is an uptight, judgmental, angry bigot, it is also perfectly clear from his first appearance that he doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about and that he is driven by emotional problems that he hasn&apos;t even begun to get a handle on. Marsan&apos;s extraordinary performance is one of the best things I&apos;ve seen on film for a long time. Scott has been afflicted with very bad teeth and a mild speech defect (he can&apos;t really say the letter &apos;r&apos;) and although his inner anger and bigotry is played for laughs for a lot of the film, in the end it is allowed to blossom forth in a riveting scene where his fury, jealousy and terror of his own darkness spill forth in a heartbreaking and riveting torrent. If part of the point of art is to help us to understand people we would otherwise have little sympathy with, then this film is a work of art. I&apos;ve never seen Marsan before but he deserves awards for this movie, no question.\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky is a highly enjoyable and often very funny film, but it also carries terrible sadness. I have never been a massive fan of Mike Leigh, but lately I have to admit that I was wrong. He just seems to get better and better.",

Yes, it&apos;s all a bit of a muddle at times, and plays like the disconnected fast-cut chapters of a cynically devise modern supermarket bestselling novel.\n\nBut it&apos;s different.\n\nNot out-there different, just stoically different from the average Hollywood committee-designed faux art-slice. It&apos;s a film that refuses to bend to the will of popular expectation and also to the viewer&apos;s clamouring desire for exposition.\n\nFor that it&apos;s to be applauded; it seems remarkable it managed mainstream distribution given the fact so many will be &apos;bored&apos; (&apos;man&apos;) awaiting the connections to satisfy their anticipation.\n\nAnd you may well gather what&apos;s going on before it&apos;s explained (with a little ultimate dubiety) on screen, but this is still a well-executed piece of cinema with a solid cast that dares to offer something a little different to current lame traits after seemingly setting itself up as just another by-the-numbers collage.\n\nClever at times, atmospheric, beautifully shot with a good cast. Worth, nay deserving, of a watch as a mild antidote to patronising Hollywood mainstream. A solid seven out of ten.",

Chris Marker lets his mind and camera roam through the landscape of early eighties Japan, and his imagination drift across the world. Memory history and emotion blend into a loving study of human existence. The film&apos;s form is loose and sprawling and it it almost impossible to try to follow it in any linear fashion. Instead it washes across the surface of you conscious mind, occasionally burrowing deep with images you can never forget. It is a completely unique film and is inspiring in its ability to bring the political, the philosophical and the poetic together on screen. Chris Marker is one of the unsung greats of film history.",

There is a small amount of story here, but mostly just a guy fed up with the world and he spends the whole movie telling you why he&apos;d rather be dead. Very, very funny stuff. I love to watch this when I&apos;m having a bad day. It has so little plot you can jump in anywhere and watch as long as you want 5 mins or the whole thing, you&apos;ll get a few laughs and not miss a story. If you don&apos;t like the first ten minutes turn it off, it&apos;s not going to change. But if you can relate to the main character like I belive most of us can you&apos;ll have a great time laughing with and agreeing with this man who&apos;s just fed up with ...well, everything and everybody. Interesting note Jani Lane (lead singer for the band Warrant) makes his film debut, and Jim Carrey has a role as well. Get angry prepare to laugh and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "The most ridiculous, indicative, one might say, reference comedy with the participation of the legendary comic quartet &quot;Charlots&quot;. These guys are really great - they made some killer funny comedies, but only here, in &quot;4 Musketeers,&quot; did they appear in all the splendor of their talents.\n\nThe difference of this film from such comedies as &quot;Recruits Going to War&quot; or &quot;Crazy at the Stadium&quot; is that, firstly, it is a parody of numerous screen versions of the famous Dumas novel, and, secondly, the director does not give &quot; Charlottess &quot;to turn everything that happens on the screen into a simple clownery with grimaces, grimaces and jumps, to which this clown group constantly strives. Their previous comedies staged by Claude Zidi are rather plotless variety-circus acts, and this film is a full-fledged sitcom, a true masterpiece of buffoon and parody art.\n\nIn the film, all the main values of France are ridiculed, everything that the great writer wrote out in his novel with such zeal, everything that great actors and directors have been recreating on the screens for years. All that for years was called true French - French spirit, musketeer honor, courage, battles for the heart of a beautiful lady, royal stories about pendants - all this is exposed in such an idiotic light that it is simply impossible to watch serious comedies after this comedy.\n\nThe main characters here are, of course, clever, cunning and cheerful servants of the musketeers, while the musketeers themselves are exposed to arrogant, blunt idlers who are worthless without their servants. The cardinal is a complete moron, the king is a loser, the sadist father Zherbe is just a sex maniac and a fool. A lot of funniest tricks, adventures and funny gags accompany the adventures of four servants - they left the cardinal&apos;s guardsmen without pants, gave kicks to the king and the cardinal, dressed Buckingham into a woman - which they didn&apos;t do!\n\nThe fantasies and ingenuity of &quot;Charlots&quot; and the writers do not get tired of being surprised. At the same time, they still managed to preserve the charm of the original musketeers, did not make a pathetic parody of the novel, namely, offered him an ironic rethinking. Laughing at yourself never hurts! The film is very smart and also shot in stunning scenery and give odds to many of these productions. Our, for example, the production of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; is significantly inferior to the beauty of the costumes and scenery of this uncommon comedy.\n\nIn everything that happens on the screen, the experienced hand of a great professional is felt. Still would! If you take a look at the director&apos;s name, you immediately understand how &quot;Charlots&quot; managed not to overstep his foolishness - Andre Yunnabel, the creator of the genius trilogy &quot;Fantômas&quot; - one of the best French comedies.\n\nWell, of course, what a French comedy without fights, chases, disguises, substitutions, witty dialogues and beautiful girls? None So here we will see fascinating horse races, parody fights with swords, as well as with batons, rakes, crayfish and blacksmiths. And the girls are just beautiful, especially the beautiful Catherine Jordan as Anna of Austria and charming Josephine Chaplin as Constance.\n\nFascinating, classic, arrogant comedy, one of the most exciting films of the 70s in this genre. The best film &quot;Charlots&quot;, a true comedy masterpiece!",

It&apos;s a shame they used this SFX since otherwise it was pretty decent movie with nice atmosphere and some intense images.

Though the fight sequences here aren&apos;t has badly done as in his subsequent movies (the editing is less frenzic), they are few and far between. As a result, action fans will really be bored, especially since the story is so drab, despite it involving a serial killer who&apos;s especially sadistic. New twists to the story only occasionally come, and they are usually so murky that eventually the viewers will be confused as to who is doing what (and why.)\n\nSeagal and Wayans never quite generate the necessary chemistry, despite the fact that their characters are opposed in their views and practices. Although they occasionally have some mildly amusing dialogue, the level of dialogue is generally bad, sometimes mind-bogglingly so.\n\n It&apos;s easy to see why this didn&apos;t do much at the box office, and why Seagal increasingly became frustrated with Warner Brothers, eventually leaving them. (Though he returned for EXIT WOUNDS for some reason.) Seagal needs to not only stop playing the same basic character in each of his movies, but stop choosing scripts that recycle the same basic elements we see in almost every one of his movies. If he does that, there is a possibility he could remove the stigma of being a glorified &quot;B&quot; movie actor."

      "reviewBody": "The Christmas Season Massacre (2001)\n\n* 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nCheaply produced horror film about a loser kid who gets picked on through school until one Christmas when he disappears without a trace. Each Christmas after that one of his classmates comes up murdered so after the latest victim the survivors gather up for some fun (WTF?). THE Christmas SEASON MASSACRE isn&apos;t a 100% &quot;Christmas&quot; horror film as it pretty much just takes place in Christmastown, CA and its story mentions the holiday. There&apos;s nothing visually that&apos;s going to take you back to Santa Claus but this isn&apos;t the biggest problem. I actually thought the film started off fairly well as we get a pretty funny story about the dork everyone picked on and then we follow this up with some fairly gory death scenes. Everything pretty much falls apart after this because there&apos;s simply not too much story to work with here and quite often we just get scenes that drag on for no reason other than to run up the running time. I think when the horror elements are on the film works the best. As I said, there are some pretty gory death scenes here and while the special effects are cheap at least the filmmakers tried to give fans what they would want. The film even gives us some nudity. As you&apos;d expect, the performances aren&apos;t the greatest and there are all sorts of flaws with the film so in the end it&apos;s only going to be worth watching to fans of these types of films."

On the other hand it also includes love, forgiveness, and the knowledge that the little problems on earth do not really matter in the end. This is where the movie shows has its strength too. Bully Herbig achieves to impersonate death as belonging to human life, and therefore being very human. By the comic relief of his acting the movie connects depth and entertainment in a very palatable combination.\n\nIn my opinion this is one of the better German movies of the last ten years, and definitely worth watching. Even more so as it is set in a beautiful panoramic landscape: in the Bavarian mountains.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Wet Dreams 2&quot; (aka &quot;Mongjunggi 2&quot;) is a stereotypical South Korean romantic comedy, for better or worse. So I suppose it might be an either you like it or dislike it situation for its outcome.\n\nI have watched the first movie in the series and I enjoyed that - although I think I might not have reviewed it actually. So of course I sat down to watch &quot;Wet Dreams 2&quot; as well. Actually, this is the second time I&apos;ve seen it, so I better get around to reviewing it.\n\nYou know what you are getting when you sit down to watch &quot;Wet Dreams 2&quot;; a young adult comedy filled with hilarious situations that often involve semi-lewd situations. It is funny and enjoyable, I will say that much. Especially the fart thing that goes on in the movie. Farts are always funny, right?\n\nThe movie is a good laugh from start to end, and the story is actually good, albeit generic for a romantic comedy of this sort. But this is something that South Korean cinema usually pulls off nicely, which is also the case for this 2005 movie.\n\nThere is a good ensemble of cast to perform the various roles and characters in the movie, and I will say that they actually really got some very nice actors and actresses for the movie, lots of familiar faces if you are somewhat familiar with South Korean cinema.\n\nI am rating &quot;Wet Dreams 2&quot; a six out of ten stars. Definitely well worth the watch if you enjoy romantic comedies with sexual undertones and good laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "A box office phenomenon at the time (this was one of those movie that people reportedly waited in line for hours to see), LOVE STORY has continued to be ridiculed by cynics and adored by romantics for decades. The secret to the film&apos;s ultimate effectiveness is in it&apos;s simplicity. Director Arthur Hiller wisely films Eric Segal&apos;s screenplay (an adaptation of his own best-selling novel) in a concise and straightforward manner, allowing audiences to become enamored with the characters and involved with their plight. The film even manages to make subtle commentary on class struggles, personal identity, and even the changing attitudes of religion, all of which while never appearing preachy or obvious under Hiller&apos;s unpretentious direction.\n\nAli MacGraw brings an undeniable spunk to her characterization here which helps undercut the potential sentimentality of the picture, and lends the finale a greater emotional punch. The natural handsomeness and effortless charm of Ryan O&apos;Neal is used to exceptional effect, and the supporting performances of Ray Milland and John Marley (as two very different types of fathers) are terrific. This is a film that never attempts to disguise it&apos;s own thematic manipulations, which may very be why it remains so effective. French composer Francis Lai&apos;s haunting original score further enhances the film, which is justifiably considered by many to be one of the all-time tearjerkers.",

Realizing his place is back home, he packs up and begins his trek to England...but with the unwelcome addition of 2 French children (Roddy McDowall and Peggy Ann Garner) whose parents fear for their safety in Nazi-occupied France.\n\nBut what should be a relatively easy journey turns into a nightmare, as French civilization crumbles around them. Every time Woolley and his companions face a crisis, another desperate child joins the group, until he finds himself the leader of quite a menagerie.\n\nOthers in the cast include Anne Baxter as &quot;Nicole,&quot; who helps Wooley outsmart the German occupiers and Otto Preminger as &quot;Major Diesson,&quot; the ranking Nazi who also finds he has use for Woolley and his children.\n\n&quot;The Pied Piper&quot; doesn&apos;t shy away from the grim realities of war and the suffering it imposes on everyone, both young and old. One can only imagine the impact this film had on moviegoers in 1942. The film was released just 7 months after Pearl Harbor.",

      "reviewBody": "The Big Town is an underrated movie. It boasts of a fantastic cast, and an interesting storyline, yet there are few who remember this movie. I suppose the screenplay and direction could have been better, yet this movie deserves more appreciation than it actually got. Matt Dillon puts in a good performance as the young shooter from a small town, trying to make it big with the &apos;throw of the dice&apos;. But the man who steals the show is Tommy Lee Jones with an excellent performance as the old timer( a shooter himself) who doesn&apos;t think too kindly of the &apos;new kid on the block(Dillon). Diane Lane, better known for Murder at 1600, plays his wife, and Tom Skeritt and Suzy Amis are good in supporting roles. Amis, in particular, makes excellent use of her limited screen time. This movie is definitely recommended. Truly outstanding work by the entire cast."

      "reviewBody": "Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Sigmund Freud, namely: who actually created the body of work credited to William Shakespeare? Experts have debated, books have been written, and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature. Anonymous poses one possible answer, focusing on a time when scandalous political intrigue, illicit romances in the Royal Court, and the schemes of greedy nobles lusting for the power of the throne were brought to light in the most unlikely of places: the London stage. -- (C) Sony Pictures\n\nAs an average movie-goer, I had no idea that Shakespeare&apos;s authorship was ever questioned. I didn&apos;t know there were theories that existed that other people might have been the true author of the plays, one of which the film focuses on is Oxford. But as far as what ANONYMOUS achieves, it certainly opened my mind as an individual that there is a possibility that another person might have been the true writer of the plays. I mean, why not? It makes the whole thing pertaining to Shakespeare&apos;s plays much more interesting. At the most basic level, ANONYMOUS does one thing right: It&apos;s damn interesting and entertaining.\n\nEven as a person who never liked Shakespeare&apos;s plays (especially the dreaded ROMEO AND JULIET), the film manages to be involving. I was compelled throughout the film, and what makes it work are the actors. Most of them are on the top of their game, including Rhys Ifans who is unrecognizable as Oxford compared to his role in HARRY POTTER 7 PT.1. Even his stares are intense. Rafe Spall as William Shakespeare seems to have a field day with his role, portraying him as an attention-seeking, moneygrubbing actor. I&apos;d also like to point out that Sebastian Armesto, playing Ben Jonson, seems to have an unexpected greater amount of sreentime than anyone else in the film, and he does well in his role as the aspiring writer who plays as a messenger between Oxford and Shakespeare.\n\nAnother interesting thing to point out is that the film really doesn&apos;t focus on the whole authorship debate a lot. We see that Oxford is the writer giving the scripts to Ben, but other than that, the film pretty much brushes it off to the side and, instead, focuses more on the relationship between Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I as well as the Essex Rebellion. As you can tell, the cast is pretty huge, and I have to admit the first 20 minutes of the film is pretty confusing. We&apos;re introduced to a world with many characters and time periods jumping all over the place, but it gets easier to grasp once you get to know the characters.\n\nOverall, ANONYMOUS is an interesting and entertaining film that will get people talking about who the real author of the plays are. The least anyone would get out of it is two hours of a fun &quot;what if?&quot; scenario. The performances by the cast is what really makes the film, though. If it wasn&apos;t for the cast, the film wouldn&apos;t have worked. Additionally, haters of director Roland Emmerich might find themselves pleased that ANONYMOUS is a character-driven film that doesn&apos;t rely on things being destroyed every five minutes. I&apos;d like to see him make more films like this.",

Co-directed by Nicholas Ray (or was it finished?) &quot;Macao&quot; stands out for me from the real routine Hollywood films of the period, the ones that were meant to make a lot of money and did.\n\nBrad Dexter&apos;s finest film role as the whispering crook, Mitchum sparkles (or rather, snoozes his way through) in his best comedic vein, Russell and Grahame are perfectly decorative, however it&apos;s a pity Bendix couldn&apos;t have stuck around to the end. Mitchum boarded Macao without a passport and was the only one not searched at Customs - and the slender thread the whole story hangs by is also perpetrated by Thomas Gomez there too.\n\nIf you, like me liked &quot;The big steal&quot; or &quot;His kind of woman&quot; you&apos;re sure to like this.",

While this device could have left us with a fragmented feeling, it worked quite well to put us in the mind of characters who work in &quot;art&quot; photography. \n\nThe plot was poignant and difficult. While it could have left me unsatisfied with a Hollywood ending, it took a bolder route, which in the end was much more satisfying.\n\nI felt that the acting was quite well done. This script could have led to a lot of really dreadful mugging for the camera, but the director got very specific performances from a talented cast. \n\nThough not as widely acclaimed as &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; I thought this movie was more satisfying. If you liked Canyon, this one definitely deserves to be seen."

      "name": "Weak structure and some cheap aspects but the content will mean fans of the music and the period will enjoy it",
      "reviewBody": "As I said on my Beef user-comment, I only became aware of this series of films because of Canibus going after Quincy Jones III for supposedly not paying anyone for their contributions, but when I watched the first Beef documentary I actually quite liked it and thought it did a good job of capturing some famous battles. In this second film there is some overlap but it tries to present a slightly different approach by focusing on beefs that mostly start from business situations; whether it be people lifting from other people&apos;s work, arguments over money, arguments over things said in the media and so on.\n\nThis structure doesn&apos;t quite stay in place though because while some of the fights do start over stolen lines or beats, we ultimately do have many that start over words spoken in public towards the other artist, with a thin connection to being &quot;business related&quot; because they were said between people in a sort of business relationship. OK, this aside though the film still does a solid enough job of capturing these moments in hip-hop history but the weaker structure to the film means it is sporadic without a good connection between the various segments. This does weaken the film because the first Beef did manage to have an overall flow that held the segments together but here it is less so.\n\nAs before the best segments are not necessarily the best or biggest battles but rather the ones where both sides are talking. So in particular although one could say unkind things about the status of D12 and Royce da 5&apos;9&quot;, their segment is really engaging because it does show how things escalate and how things said on a record or in an interview can get out of hand very quickly. Conversely the segments on LL/Canibus and KRS1/Nelly (who?) makes a good point about the role played by the corporations behind the larger artist – it is a good point but one the film doesn&apos;t follow up on particularly well despite claiming this topic as the overall thread for this film – again because of the weaker structure.\n\nThe structure isn&apos;t helped by the slight feeling that, while interesting, Beef II was perhaps produced as a cheaper produce. Many of the interviews are clearly from those used for the first film so you do get the feeling of QB3 chuckling to himself about only having to pay interview crews once for material he can get several products out of. I&apos;m not saying the whole film is like this or that the product is cheap, just that it can feel that way when so much looks like it was done on one afternoon. The cheap and unnecessary re-enactments also don&apos;t help either, as they smack of a second rate Crimewatch show and they do nothing to help the telling of the stories. Likewise rapid editing of video clips over audio of someone talking may appeal to the MTV generation but it tended to distract from what was being said – it would have been better to have allowed a long shot of the interviewee or to have played audio over still pictures of the individual talking in a radio station; less exciting and less energy perhaps but it would have improved the feel of the product as a documentary.\n\nAs before, this film is not strong enough to interest those with no interest in hip-hop although it may have enough familiar faces to interest those casual viewers with a passing knowledge of the artists involved. For fans of the genre it is a good film because, for all its missed opportunities and structural weaknesses, it does capture moments in hip-hop that otherwise would fade away and be forgotten. Not a great documentary then but well worth a look for genre fans who want to look back on these moments."

Bomb techs, of course, are those heroic individuals who get called when a bomb or other explosive device is discovered. Their job, under life and death pressure daily, is to defuse the bomb and make things safe for the rest of us. Unfortunately, in war environments, this is a daily occurrence. What kind of person can do this kind of work? How do they do it day in and day out? Someone has to be a little crazy to do this in the first place, don’t they? These are the questions this movie explores. The movie evokes sadness, inspiration, sympathy, concern, and even awe as we watch the heroes of this movie struggle with their daily grind.",

      "reviewBody": "To say that novelist Jim Thompson has been badly served by American directors would be something of an understatment as the only worthwhile version to emerge from Hollywoodland, &apos;The Grifters&apos;, is directed by Englishman Stephen Frears. Apart from that, one has to look to France for the two adaptations that capture Thompson&apos;s spirit and do him justice, namely &apos;Série Noire&apos; of Alain Corneau, based upon &apos;A hell of a Woman&apos; and &apos;Coup de Torchon&apos;, adapted by director Betrand Tavernier and legendary screenwriter Jean Aurenche from &apos;Pop 1280&apos; with the setting transposed from Texas to Senegal.\n\nThe change of location to French West Africa is inspired as it suits perfectly Thompson&apos;s bleak view of the human condition with its lazy, morally vacuous, corrupt colonial officials and assorted low lifes. The linchpin of the film is the transformation of complacent police chief Cordelier from buffoon to judge, jury and executioner. He is so cleverly played by Tavernier&apos;s favourite actor, the superlative Philippe Noiret, that one can neither condone nor condemn him nor dismiss him as a lunatic. Audiences through the years have shown their admiration for vigilantes but for this viewer at any rate, any regard for Cordelier&apos;s actions are soon diminished.\n\nNoiret&apos;s superb performance is complemented by those of Isabelle &apos;super&apos; Huppert as his horny-as-hell mistress, Stéphane Audran as his unfaithful wife, Guy Marchand as his bigoted superior and the always good value Jean Pierre Marielle again showing his versatility by playing two brothers. Irene Skobline plays the schoolteacher whose comparative innocence attracts Cordelier and it is a great pity that her film career did not progress any further.\n\nThe cruelty and cynicism of the piece is balanced by the visual elegance one has come to expect from this director, whilst the production design is by Alexandre Trauner and the sun-drenched cinematography by Pierre William Glenn who also shot the aforementioned &apos;Série Noire&apos;. Although the steadicam has been over used in recent years it is here extremely effective.\n\nThroughout the 1970&apos;s Tavernier had come to be regarded as a &apos;humanist&apos; director so this came as something of a surprise. It proved a commercial but not a critical success. It is an ambiguous, unsettling, fascinating film and now that nations have been forced to come to terms with their colonial past, it is more relevant than ever.",

Till Schweiger on the other hand is a, well, decent and very popular German actor who, for this movie, pretended to also be a director.  Unfortunately, the whole shtick didn&apos;t work out as well as hoped, and &quot;Der Eisbär&quot; turns out to be a glossy but ultimately pointless, and occasionally annoying, flick.  It comes laden with Schweiger&apos;s actor buddies and is well filmed and &quot;easy on the eye&quot; (nice camerawork, good locations, coherent costumes, etc.), but the story is paper thin and has been done a hundred times before, and better.  What really turned me off was the fact that Schweiger seems to think that simply having him on the screen for extended periods would make great cinema, and that copying Tarantino&apos;s style with a large brush would make him a great director, as if Tarantino&apos;s work was unseen of in this country.  The movie is practically Schweiger&apos;s cinematic ego trip, and I did not find it was worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "Concluding reviewing African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we&apos;re at the near end of 1970 when James Earl Jones reprises his Tony-winning role as boxer Jack Jefferson in film version of The Great White Hope which got him an Oscar nomination. Since this takes place in the early part of the 20th century, he&apos;s not very much liked by the majority white public of America at the time certainly whenever he&apos;s seen with his Caucasian female partner Eleanor Backman (Jane Alexander, also Academy nominated). His former girlfriend Clara (Marlene Warfield) certainly resents Eleanor for usurping her power over Jack who has no use for her. Good thing he has his manager Goldie (Lou Gilbert) as well as his trainer Tick (Joel Fluellen) on his side so they all go to Europe where they don&apos;t have to worry about jail time. I&apos;ll just stop there and just say that the staginess is quite evident in many scenes. Still, both Jones and Ms. Alexander are effective whenever they&apos;re together whether intimate or arguing. And Fluellen has his biggest role here and makes the most of it. In addition, it was such a treat, after playing husband-and-wife in Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Dinner, to see Beah Richards-as Jack&apos;s mother-and Roy Glenn-as a pastor at her house-in the same scene again. And seeing Bill Walker-so memorable as Reverend Sykes in To Kill a Mockingbird-playing a deacon in an early scene was also pleasurable to me. One more thing, Hal Holbrook has a memorable turn as an attorney interviewing Ms. Alexander. So on that note, The Great White Hope is highly recommended. Oh, and while this is the official last entry for BHM, there are a few movies I wanted to review in the time alloted that I&apos;m viewing in the next few days (or weeks, depending on my mood) so if you are reading this under my username, watch this space for those reviews...",

      "reviewBody": "1st watched 6/6/2007 - 7 out of 10(Dir-John Sayles): Strange and unique quiet drama about a man who lands on earth as an escapee from another planet where he was apparently a slave. Joe Morton, as this brother from the other planet has no dialogue but effectively portrays a true illegal alien. He really is a frail being who just wants to do good and be needed. He is being hunted by what appears to be his owners but he affects everyone he comes across in such a positive way that they get behind him 100% and keep these thugs from getting him. He eventually earns his money by fixing things with his otherworldly powers(once he realizes that stealing isn&apos;t right) and even gets to the point of hunting down a drug dealer in Harlem who has caused the demise of a young one in the neighborhood. This character is probably the most likable alien that has ever been put on the screen(next to maybe E.T.) and it&apos;s definitely a departure from most films. The low production value is certainly evident but the character and the storyline keeps you interested and rooting for this unlikely hero from another planet. These were the type of quiet independent movies that were made in the 80&apos;s when it was truly &quot;seen&quot; that the budget was low, but the makers only cared about creating a worthwhile project and John Sayles definitely did that with this one. This 80&apos;s relic is not to be missed by a true cinemaphile or anyone who wants to see the benefits of good deeds even if it&apos;s coming from someone with feet a little different than ours.",

So I throw on Finding Quantum Quest and for the rest of my work night I&apos;m transfixed by the story and journey that these guys went on to find this &quot;lost&quot; film. After finishing the podcast I do a search and low and behold it&apos;s available to view on YouTube!\n\nFrom what I had heard on the podcast and from a friend who watched it before me: the film was disjointed and flawed. Just watched it now and it&apos;s actually put together far better than I thought it was gonna be. Definitely has the feeling that we are missing huge chunks of it but they tie what they do have together quite well. Without the missing chunks though it&apos;s definitely lacking the punch it needs to be a good flick. I think if we had the chunks of story they had to chop off we would have a fun ride of a science film. Maybe one day the missing pieces will be added and we can see this in all its glory.",

      "reviewBody": "As with some other excellent PBS documentaries, this one manages to combine a chronological treatment with a thematic one - a key technique that encourages full absorption in this fascinating biographical subject.\n\nMost of us know Frida Kahlo only by her trademark eyebrows, not least because so many of her works are self-portraits. But as one of the commentators remarks, &quot;It is impossible to separate the life and work of this person.&quot; Two big influences are immediately apparent - a near-fatal traffic accident at eighteen and the stormy relationship with her husband, the communist mural-painter Diego Rivera.\n\nThe accident had left her with a smashed spine, pelvis and thighs, in her own words &apos;old in an instant&apos;, and as it would turn out, infertile too, following a wretched miscarriage. Art historian Victor Zamudio Taylor comments that she had to piece herself together, while also pieceing together Mexico itself, whose history took dramatic turns throughout her short life. Her earliest memories were of the Zapata revolution, which raised a lot of false hopes, but turned Mexico City into a brilliant centre of creativity and debate. In particular, there was a keen celebration of pre-Columbian history, rejecting the European influences, digging deep into hidden Mexico.\n\nThis accounts for many of the aggressive shapes and colours in her work, in which politics and religion also show through clearly. Catholic by upbringing, she became a Stalinist rebel, but her own sufferings emerge in images that reflect the dolours of the cross. &apos;Painting pain&apos; somebody called it.\n\nHer husband Diego was huge, ugly and anarchistic. (Her disapproving mother said it was like an elephant marrying a dove.) Like all Marxists, he conveniently declared that &apos;fidelity is bourgeois&apos;, and carried on shamelessly with her trusted sister, among others. Frida now considered herself at liberty to cultivate new relationships, not all of them with men, but this did not seem to bring happiness; there was even a brief divorce. It seems they couldn&apos;t live with each other, or without each other, in the style of Rhett and Scarlett.\n\nBut the never-ending pain eventually grew too much, and the painkillers became an addiction. Her first solo exhibition in Mexico City was celebrated as her death party, as she insisted that the whole four-poster bed should be transported to the gallery, with her in it. What a way to go!\n\nMeanwhile it was Diego who had arranged for Trotsky to come to Mexico and live with them. Trotsky&apos;s close friendship with Frida may or may not have been consummated, but it is odd that we hear nothing of their reactions to his violent death. This is one of only a few small criticisms we can level at this otherwise excellent production with its exceptionally high standard of commentary. For example, the film ends on a recent auction, at the moment when a Kahlo painting passes the million-dollar mark. But we are not told why interest in Kahlo should have risen so sharply after her death. Also, the musical track is rather cod-Mexican, quite apart from occasional bumps and squeaks.",

      "reviewBody": "Alexander Key&apos;s popular pre-teen novel concerns two orphaned siblings with supernatural powers taken in by a nefarious millionaire (named Aristotle Bolt!) who wants to exploit their magical abilities for personal gain. Top-notch Walt Disney adventure for families has natural, non-precocious performances from young Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards as the gifted kids, and their friendship with good-hearted traveler Eddie Albert is sweet but not sticky. The eerie flashbacks to the youngsters&apos; early beginnings are well-captured by director John Hough, who is otherwise forced (perhaps for budgetary reasons) to skimp on genuine atmosphere in place of an elongated chase. Too bad the finale replaces emotion with effects, as these characters are quite remarkable. Followed by a fairly wan sequel, 1978&apos;s &quot;Return From Witch Mountain&quot;, in which the special effects became the whole show. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "There are so many movies about Ninjas out there in a day and age when obtaining them is the easiest it has ever been. There are dozens upon dozens of flicks with just the word &quot;Ninja&quot; in the title alone, which only makes it more of a daunting task to actually find one that is worth your time. The good news? Not only does this movie feel like you are watching a live- action anime like Ninja Scroll, with all the over- the-top sword induced blood geysers raining across your screen but Lady Ninja (1998) actually stars an eye patch rocking Jubei Yagyu, the protagonist from the anime and novels. So for all you Ninja Scroll, Samurai Reincarnation, Reborn From Hell fans, you might want to check this out for the Jubei action alone. Based on the novel,&apos;Yagyū Ninpōchō&apos;(1964) by Futaro Yamada, the basic plot of the movie centres around legendary real life butt-kicker Jubei (portrayed by Hitoshi Ozawa, who also directs) as he leads the seven female survivors of the Hori clan on a revenge mission against the Seven Spears, acting as their demon protector and donning a gnarly oni mask to conceal his secret identity from the bad guys like a samurai Spiderman.\n\nThe quickest way to find out if this movie is for you or not is to ask yourself these three questions;\n\n&quot;Did I like the classic 90&apos;s anime Ninja Scroll?&quot;\n\n&quot;Do I like ninja movies in general?&quot;\n\n&quot;Would I like to see a movie where someone has the superpower to be able to absorb a Dragonball Z type energy blast up their who-ha and regurgitate it out of their mouth?&quot;\n\nYou now have your answer. You&apos;re welcome.\n\nPROS\n\n\n* Sexy Ninja Magic!\n\n\n\n* LOTS of blood (possibly the most I&apos;ve ever seen in a Ninja flick since the 1983 flick Duel to the Death)\n\n\n\n* Starts with the action right away (literally one of the best openers I&apos;ve seen) and keeps a good pace all the way until the end credits.\n\n\n\n* Some very inventive bad guys (&quot;Eyeball Minions&quot; Ninja was a favorite)\n\n\nCONS\n\n\n* Possibly TOO SEXY Ninja Magic (a 10 on the creepy raunchy meter sometimes - so a warning to those more sensitive)\n\n\n\n* Weird wound logic. Somebody will get sliced one time and multiple blood fountains will pour out from random parts of the body that couldn&apos;t possibly have been hit with one swipe of the sword. Or could it?!?\n\n\n\n* Confusing subplots. At some point one of the leads starts channeling the spirit of a blind swordsman Zatoichi type character and it is never fully explained why the bad guys can&apos;t tell it&apos;s this famous person with just their eyes closed pretending to be blind. Worse than Superman simply removing his glasses and slicking his hair back\n\n\nFINAL SCORE \n\n3/10 stars if you are an average movie goer but if you answered yes to all three questions like myself, Lady Ninja is an easy-\n\n7/10 stars",

      "reviewBody": "Villain lost out at the 2011 Japan Academy Awards on the big prizes to Confessions. While Directing, Script and Best Picture went the way of the bleak, hyper-stylised Takako Matsu flick, all four acting awards were scooped by Villain. The reason for that split is abundantly clear.\n\nVillain centres on lonely Yuichi who drives through the night and occasionally meets women through online dating sites. The forum for their meeting suggests each is as flawed as the other. When one assignation goes very badly indeed, something dark in Yuichi is unleashed. He then gets a message from another female via the site, and so two life-changing events take place within seconds of each other.\n\nVillain explores complex questions of moral responsibility, the hypocrisy of social condemnation, and the extent of individual responsibility. The direction is workmanlike, and the framing rarely gets beyond a TV aesthetic. But the script is naturalistic and offers genuine insight, peaking in the father of the victim (Akira Emoto) revealing that hateful people are the way they are because they are too cowardly to risk caring for someone. Emoto and Kirin Kiki excel as the elder generation struggling to come to terms with the ugly turn the world has taken. Krini Kiki, faced with extortion, goes from bewilderment to fear to resignation all by changes of expression and never a word spoken. But it is the two young leads, Eri Fukatsu and Satoshi Tsumabuki, who truly excel here. Fukatsu especially shows a young woman capable of living with the emptiness inside her, until meeting someone who can fill it proves too much to bear. The cathartic peak of the film is her scene of self-awareness. Tsumabaki also gets to test his range at the end, but in a much more chilling and wonderfully ambiguous direction.\n\nThere are good guys and bad guys here, as you&apos;d expect given the content, but they are not where you expect to find them. There is a murderer, but we are less convinced of our stance towards him than we are to the press-pack parasites, conman doctor, self-absorbed mother, and shallow and narcissistic university undergrad. A bus driver strangely earns our cheers, and is perhaps the only unambiguous &apos;good&apos; character in the film. In a time where heinous crimes have become everyday and our ability to relate with one another seems fragmented and brutalised, the causes may not always be where the lazy self-appointed moral guardians in the media and corridors of power suggest they lie. \n\nVillain is a slow build to its message, a slightly meandering survey of its theme, and the pacing can frustrate over the flabby 139 minutes. But it is worth sticking with for the questions it forces you to reflect on at the end, and the consummate acting. One of the best films to come out of Japan this century.",

      "reviewBody": "Hans Albers stars as Werner Holk, an engineer who is working with Professor Achenbach (Friedrich Kabler) on a machine that will turn lead into gold. When an &quot;accident&quot; occurs that costs the Professor his life, Holk swears vengeance, and determines that the mastermind behind the sabotage was Scottish millionaire John Wills (Michael Bohnen), who has his own rival group working on the same machine. Wills actually hires Holk on to help make his machine a success, and while at first Holk is determined to destroy Wills&apos; effort from within, when Holk meets Wills&apos; daughter Florence (Brigitte Helm) he begins to second guess his mission. Also featuring Ernst Karchow, Lien Deyers, and Eberhard Leithoff.\n\nThis was one of UFA&apos;s biggest productions, and no expense was spared constructing the vast set containing the alchemical machine. Footage of the apparatus was later reused in The Magnetic Monster (1953). Despite the spectacle, this movie is at heart a drama about revenge, a rumination on science run amok, and a low-key if effective romance. Albers, an actor I was largely unfamiliar with, is very good. He was Germany&apos;s biggest star from 1930-1945, and is often referred to as &quot;Germany&apos;s John Wayne&quot;. He wasn&apos;t a Nazi and never a sympathizer with their cause, but he was embraced by the regime, and when the war ended his career basically went with it, although he later had several smaller, character parts. Brigitte Helm, most famous for Metropolis, is also good as the rich man&apos;s daughter who has everything but love in her life.",

      "reviewBody": "I loved the first two Batman movies, and honestly would have loved to see Burton go on to direct more entries in the series, but Joel Shumacher&apos;s Batman Forever is not at all an unwelcome change. I think some people recollect this film and automatically associate it with Shumacher&apos;s awful second Batman attempt, Batman &amp; Robin. That is the bad movie. This is not. People also seem to forget how big of a hit it was. Artistically, there were things it got wrong and didn&apos;t do as well as the others, but there were things it did so much better, too. For one thing, this is the only &apos;Batman&apos; with a decent soundtrack to its name (including 2 great songs by U2 and Seal).\n\nIn some ways you can look at this as a transition from the dark, tortured Batman to a Batman who has finally conquered his personal demons and gone on to be happier in being a man who fights crime in the night dressed up in rubber. For this one it was good, &apos;cause that&apos;s essentially how it ends, but the result of this led to the campy and just plain boring 4th episode.\n\nBut I really was surprised at how psychological of a movie Batman Forever is. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s particularly deep, but when you look at Edward Nygma&apos;s obsession with Bruce Wayne (stalking him, to imitating him right down to the mole), Harvey Dent&apos;s schizophrenia as Two-Face, and the fact that both Bruce Wayne AND Batman end up romancing the same psychologist is all enormously amusing. The romance isn&apos;t to be taken that lightly, though. I thought out of all 5 films Chase Meridian was Bruce&apos;s best girlfriend. The whole Vicky Vale relationship was pretty stale if you cut out all of the conflict with the Joker, and obviously Selina Kyle didn&apos;t work out so well for Bruce. Having this woman who could understand the mind of the tortured Bruce Wayne was a great idea, and I don&apos;t need to tell you that the gorgeous and talented Nicole Kidman pulled it off well.\n\nSomething I liked (and would have liked to have seen more of) was the competitive relationship between Bruce Wayne and Edward Nygma. They&apos;re enemies as Batman and The Riddler but also as regular people in everyday life. Take that scene at the Nygmatec Ball when Edward gloats about how well off he is, but Bruce is totally unflinching. Jim Carrey does a great job with a character that is so obsessed with this person; who idolizes him but hates him at the same time and is generally evil, but still can make us fall on the floor laughing.\n\nThis is a rousing and dynamic picture. It&apos;s basically the lighter side of being Batman. It was exciting with some great action sequences: I loved the end where both Robin and Chase are dropped and he saves them both. That piece of Elliot Goldenthal music when Batman finally grasps Robin&apos;s arm is excellent.\n\nI liked Burton&apos;s 2 films and obviously Batman Begins better than Forever, but when you&apos;re in the right mood for it, it really is a fantastic movie that, if nothing else, thoroughly entertains.\n\nMy rating: 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Annals of history are a long story of a sea of blood... It is difficult to argue. There is virtually not a single remote corner of Europe where nobody has ever spilled someone&apos;s blood. No surprise that today, there are so many relatively small countries on this small continent with fancifully indented coasts. And all these states were always at loggerheads with each other, time and again recarving the map, taking neighbours up, conquering them, decaying themselves as a result of civil dissension Heaven knows how many world wars (Pan-European at least!) Europe, that cradle of nationalism, has suffered historically! But there were considered to be just 2 world wars: the most monstrous ones, both having wiped away from the face of the earth tens of millions of people and a few empires as well!\n\nWhen thinking about all this, one is willy-nilly likely to become filled with a holy terror; as one tries to imagine oneself were among those &apos;cogs in the machine&apos; whom POWERS THAT BE dispatch with one dread glance to that dead waste which is called war. And war has almost nothing to do with anything humanistic; &apos;almost&apos; – because some people do try by-passing the martial laws and helping neighbour, but are usually exposed and executed  And war is normally a survival-of-the-fittest (or, appreciably less likely, a survival-of-the-sliest) environment. It is unlikely that a feeble, meek one would survive the war\n\nAll these conspicuous facts have been shown in the said Russian-Finnish film. Such films are useful. They cynically break the rose-coloured specs people see through and wipe false smiles away from the faces of the of diplomats. Even such a tiny and seemingly odd land as Finland had to suffer world wars to suit its own ends and at least repeated its lesson of hatred according to the high (not the highest though) standards. Constrained between Scylla and Charybdis, i.e. Russia and Sweden, this nation has suffered centuries-old confused state, in terms of language as well: whether to speak own autochthonal Finnish tongue, or Russian, or Swedish. Partly, lingual situation is still in a turmoil in Finland, but how awful it was then, in 1918, when one might be even shot and killed for improper accent! The most frantic daredevils in the Finnish society would go to work and discriminate &apos;aliens&apos; against; and even set a shining example to those hesitant about whether to destroy &apos;aliens&apos; or not. He that is not with his nation is against it, said the daredevils to those who did not mind the existing priorities – thus making them to participate in giving short shrift to Russians (representatives of Finland&apos;s former &apos;parent state&apos;) and to their local Finnish sidekicks. Little Finland suffered its own Civil War simultaneously with Russia, and just like in Russia, it was fought between the &quot;Whites&quot; (anti-Soviet forces, which were backed by several Western powers) and the &quot;Reds&quot; (Communist forces), but the result was quite the opposite. The German-backed &quot;Whites&quot; beat the &quot;Reds&quot; all to ribands and the White Terror beat the Red one to nothing.\n\nI am quite confused to describe how much I was impressed by this film It is fearful simply because it touches upon relatively little-known events which are difficult to be grasped with mind and which unsheathe just one conjecture. That is, no nation on earth boasts clean hands. Some always die so that others live. You would not wish living &quot;in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot; on your worst enemy.\n\nI was petrified of this film",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a story so simple that it works, bound on a flawed character that is honestly excellently portrayed through Stallone. First Blood may not be the best action film out there, but it does manage to be an interesting delve into the mind of PTSD veterans from the war. I truly enjoyed this film simply because the character of John Rambo is so well written. A Green Beret Vietnam War vet struggles to find his place in society with no home, no friends, and constant animosity from others around him. It&apos;s an incredibly psychological film no doubt, but it also manages to be quite an entertaining and fascinating action film, as we see the character of Rambo progress steadily downwards throughout the film. Many may just take it as a cool film where Stallone is a beast and shoots up a whole town single handedly, and yeah that can be a fun idea at times, but I love the deeper meaning behind this film and how self aware about mental health it was even nearly 40 years ago- as well as focusing on the many injustices in the police system and how many of their actions were and still are incredibly disgusting. There are a few moments where the film jumps around in confusion, but in the end, First Blood is a highly entertaining and fascinating film that easily produces one of the most iconic characters in cinema to an breathtaking degree of accuracy and poignancy.\n\nMy Rating: 9.2/10.",

      "name": "Solid Enough Cast But A Largely Disappointing Story",
      "reviewBody": "Essentially you have here a &quot;B&quot; list cast of actors (Matthew Broderick, Virginia Madsen and Alan Alda) - none megastars, but all solid actors - who, as you would expect, put on decent enough performances. The problem with the movie is a story that misses its potential. I acknowledge that I haven&apos;t read the book. Maybe this worked better on paper, but on screen this was lacking.\n\nBroderick played Cooper, an editor for a Chicago newspaper who suffers a head injury, and then is called away himself to help care for his uncle (Alan Alda) who&apos;s in the early stages of dementia. Madsen is some type of old flame for Cooper with whom he reconnects in his hometown. All three were fine in their roles but this movie had basically two directions in which it could have gone, did a little bit of both and, ultimately, because it had no focus on either, was a disappointment.\n\nThis could have been successful as a light-hearted comedy; a humorous look at dealing with the problems of dementia. Alda captured that well; he was believable as a dementia victim, and there were things like his fish-writing obsession that could have made this touchingly funny, but those moments were few and far between. Or, this could have gone the route of emotional drama, as we watch Alda&apos;s character of Rollie (and those around him) deal with his decline, but again those moments were few and far between. There was a moment when I thought the movie had made a choice - the very powerful scene when Rollie is missing and Cooper finds him in anguish in the bathroom at the card show; lost, confused and embarrassed at what&apos;s happened. But that moment also gets lost. Instead of that, the story focuses for some reason on the old baseball card - a 1909 Cubs card that Rollie&apos;s grandfather gave him as a keepsake and that he now wants to sell. Even that could have been touching enough, but the card ends up being used primarily as a prop for staging slapstick humour, especially the ridiculous &quot;fight&quot; scene at the end of the movie.\n\nAlso burdened with unnecessary characters (especially Donny, but even Madsen&apos;s Charlotte to an extent) this was really a disappointment. 3/10",

      "reviewBody": "Comme une image (2004) was co-scripted and directed by Agnès Jaoui. (The film is known as Look at Me in the U.S. It&apos;s a reasonable title--just not the title the Director gave it.)\n\nThe plot concerns a group of educated and successful Parisians whose lives intersect in both Paris and Burgundy. The protagonist is Lolita Cassard, played by Marilou Berry. Lolita is a dedicated vocal student, whose most serious problem is that her father--played by Jean-Pierre Bacri--is too self-absorbed to pay much attention to her. Étienne Cassard is a noted author and publisher, who cares about his work, his position of power, and, to some extent, his beautiful trophy wife and their young daughter (Lolita&apos;s half-sister). Lolita&apos;s life is more trouble to him than he cares to accept, so he chooses to ignore her or belittle her.\n\nLolita is overweight, and acutely conscious of this because she is surrounded by elegant women of all ages who are slender. Lolita blames her problems on her weight and--reasonably enough--she can&apos;t bring herself to accept her father&apos;s lack of interest, let alone his lack of compassion.\n\nInto this equation comes Sylvia Millet, Lolita&apos;s vocal coach. Incredibly, director/screenwriter Jaoui also stars in this pivotal role. (It&apos;s hard to believe that Jaoui can be both an outstanding director and an experienced star. It&apos;s even harder to believe that she can direct herself in such a nuanced and intelligent performance. She must be Wonder Woman!)\n\nSylvia has true compassion and affection for Lolita, but she&apos;s not a saint, and is not above using her influence with Lolita to advance her husband&apos;s writing career.\n\nTo my mind, Agnès Jaoui represents the perfect French film star. She looks talented, intelligent, and strong, and she&apos;s also very attractive in a non-conventional way.\n\nOne reviewer wrote, &quot;Look at Me is about nothing and everything simultaneously.&quot; I disagree. It&apos;s not about everything, but it is about love, friendship, ambition, hurtfulness, and betrayal.\n\nClassical music is played and sung throughout the film, and it&apos;s outstanding. Be prepared to hear songs and arias by Verdi, Offenbach, Monteverdi, and Mozart. \n\nJaoui (with her costar Bacri) won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes. With great acting, direction, music and script, this movie is not to be missed!",

      "reviewBody": "After 30 years, I just rewatched this latter-day Marx Brothers movie. After being loaned to RKO for Room Service, the Marxes return to M-G-M without their beloved mentor there, Irving Thalberg, having died during their last hit picture there, A Day at the Races. That movie was very enjoyable, if a little long. This one is much shorter, if not as funny. Still, there&apos;s more than enough highlights here: a couple of Chico and Groucho scenes like the &quot;need-a-badge-to-get-on-train&quot; and &quot;new-cigar-needed-but-from-suspect-not-Chico&quot;, Groucho&apos;s number of &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot;, Harpo&apos;s number with some cool black singers mixed with his as-always touching harp solos, Chico&apos;s piano playing, and, of course, Groucho&apos;s wisecracks with Margaret Dumont, the unofficial fourth Marx brother now that Zeppo left by this time. Oh, and funny enough reunion with Nat Pendleton from Horse Feathers. Also, Fritz Feld has an amusing bit as a symphony conductor. The romantic leads of Kenny Baker, who I know from old broadcasts of radio&apos;s &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, and Florence Rice don&apos;t intrude too much so I didn&apos;t mind them or their singing. Oh, and Eve Arden was also a hoot opposite the one and only Groucho. So on that note, At the Circus is worth a look for any Marx fans out there, still.",

However, apart from a couple excellent performances, the film was a big let-down and was not even close to being as good as THIS GUN FOR HIRE or THE BLUE DAHLIA--two other famous Ladd films from the same era. This isn&apos;t the fault of Ladd, who as usual did an excellent job playing a tough guy (which is interesting coming from a guy as tiny as Ladd). In addition, William Bendix had an even more impressive role in the film as a sadistic animal who revels in beating people to a pulp. The sheer pleasure he obtains hurting other people is amazing and scary to watch! Now as for the rest of the film, apart from some snappy dialog, the rest of the characters are pretty one-dimensional and unconvincing. The bottom line is that this film had many of the elements of good Film Noir except for a decent script. The movie was often confusing and the ultimate solution to the mystery seemed to come from no where! In fact, it was as if they&apos;d written and written and decided to just tack on an ending generated by a coin flip and call it a day! In the end, this is a watchable but horribly flawed film. You can certainly do better with other Noir or Ladd pictures.",

      "reviewBody": "(r#43)\n\n&quot;Worst movie of all time&quot;? No, actually one of the most insane and hilarious spoofs ever made. Not much of a plot, obviously low budget, non-actors doing the best they can to keep the dialogue deadpan and serious (George Wilson as the bad guy is particularly hilarious), and of course rampaging, evil, flesh-eating tomatoes.\n\nIn the tradition of David Zucker&apos;s Scary Movies, James De Bello&apos;s jokes aim to be as shamelessly stupid, but still funny, as possible. And it worked for me. Some lines literally had me howling with laughter. &quot;Could somebody pass the ketchup?&quot;; &quot;Wienerschnitzel!&quot;; &quot;Technically, tomatoes are fags&quot;; &quot;Well, it was pretty dark, you know... it&apos;s lighter today&quot;; &quot;Why not? You&apos;re a woman!&quot;, just to name a few. And how can you not love a movie that features a catchy John Carradine-esquire theme song, a deliberately badly dubbed Japanese scientist, an insane katana-swinging WWII pilot who seems to drop from out of no where and just sort of follows along, a blind policeman, a president whose main job seems to be writing his signature on papers before crumpling them and throwing them away, a UN-type organization who spends the entire movie debating what should be done about the tomatoes before deciding it&apos;s not time to take action yet, a swimming champion who eats an entire bowl of the cereal &quot;STEROIDS&quot;, mind-numbing musical numbers, the list goes on.\n\nYou&apos;d have to be a pretty dull person not to enjoy this. Utterly insane, shamelessly cheap and silly, but somehow awesome. I&apos;d recommend this movie to anyone with a knowledge of awful movies and a good sense of humour.\n\n&quot;Mlmlmlmlmlm mneed mlmlmlmlmlmmlm...&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "What kind of movie would we have if Ingmar Bergman directed a sci-fi/fantasy film? That&apos;s an intriguing prospect, one that&apos;s precisely what&apos;s on offer in this fascinating release from writer-director Urszula Antoniak. This surrealistic tale of two women on an otherwise-uninhabited island in the wake of some unspecified mass upheaval follows them through their largely unstructured daily lives. Their story primarily focuses on their unusual relationship, which takes the form of a less-than-veiled metaphor for the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized here by a quietly &quot;polite,&quot; but nevertheless unmistakable, power struggle between an aggressive authority figure and a reluctantly submissive everywoman. But there&apos;s more to it than that, as becomes gradually apparent as the film plays out. What&apos;s most impressive here, though, is that the minimalist narrative unfolds with remarkable symbolic subtlety, represented by the picture&apos;s many deftly nuanced elements that are neither overly enigmatic nor unduly obvious, all eloquently enhanced by the film&apos;s gorgeous cinematography and beautiful background score. It calls to mind the stories told in pictures like &quot;The Pink Cloud&quot; (2021) and &quot;Embers&quot; (2015), even though the nature of the seminal event in this story is never delineated (though, from the way things unfold, it&apos;s not especially necessary either). Admittedly, some aspects of the story seem clumsily improvised, and others start out needlessly cryptic, but, once the symbolism of these sequences becomes apparent, they prove stunningly incisive, especially when interpreted on a collective basis. The result is an insightful, thought-provoking, economically told release that proves a film can successfully and expressively present meaningful material by showing more than telling, a model that more filmmakers would be wise to follow.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Happy Flight",
      "reviewBody": "Later this week I&apos;ll be on my way overseas on a flight, but no that&apos;s not the chief reason why this film appealed to me. I had chanced upon the film&apos;s release when in Tokyo last year and the trailer had caught my attention for its potential to provide some madcap humour. What&apos;s more, it stars one of my favourite Japanese actresses in Haruka Ayase, whose performance in Cyborg, She I had enjoyed, so it&apos;s only logical that I picked this film over others releasing this week.\n\nHappy Flight is a delightful surprise surpassing my expectations, where it features a myriad of characters and an ensemble cast to bring about an end to end presentation of just about everything that goes on behind the scenes from the operations of the ground crew at the check in counter, to the maintenance team, from the control tower operations centre and right up into the aircraft with the duties of the pilot and that of the cabin crew. Frequent travellers usually treat everything behind the scenes as a black box which just clicks and works, and this film provides that extra awareness and appreciation of the one million things that can and are happening, and in the worst case scenario, something simple that can go so wrong.\n\nWhich to All Nippon Airways, it&apos;s quite gutsy of them to open up and brand this film. I cannot see how a similar film can be done locally without jumping through some major hoops, and probably end up with folks being unhappy about how things can get portrayed on screen. But unlike films such as Flightplan, this one doesn&apos;t belittle any of the departments, but smartly fuses comedy without becoming veiled insults. I suppose Shinobu Yaguchi, who had helmed films like Water Boys and Swing Girls, proved to be the right person to craft a potentially complex tale on what goes on in aviation, and what he did was simply put, amazing.\n\nCleverly fusing all the different narratives and subplots, he had presented the films as a series of quick short stories, although each engaging enough to make you want to know more. While some characters can be caricatures, he pumped them up with enough engaging incidents to ultimately bring out that smile. It&apos;s also key that he had provided some behind the scenes insights from the industry, that would make you sit up and take notice, with nuggets of trivia coming from every angle and every department featured.\n\nAnd not to forget the office politics within the department themselves, and when they interact with each other (I chuckled at the tai-chi attempt), everyone depending on one another&apos;s professional expertise to ensure a pleasant flight experience for every single passenger the minute he or she steps into the airport ready for their flight out. But of course sometimes things tend to rub off the wrong way, and for dramatic sake, could be slightly exaggerated especially on what takes place within the cabin, which most of us would be aware of, or from hearsay support some urban myths.\n\nNarratively, we follow many viewpoints. We have a first officer Kazuhiro Suzuki (Seiichi Tanabe) in his final test flight to become a captain, and his Flight 1980 is assessed by an unsmiling Captain Noriyoshi Harada (Saburo Tokito) in the cockpit, which puts him under additional pressure given his disastrous attempt at the flight simulator. Then we have the ditzy cabin attendant Etsuko Saito (Haruka Ayase) who&apos;s a Calamity Jane under the supervision of Reiko Yamazaki (Shinobu Terajima) and a competing peer Mari Tanaka (Kazue Fukiishi). On the ground the subplots also extend to Tomoko Tabata&apos;s ground crew Natsumi Kimura, and Ittoku Kishbe&apos;s flight operations controller, and the list goes on, extending even toward an incident at the maintenance hangar, and a trio of comedic aviation geeks. And if all these don&apos;t seem enough, there&apos;s an oncoming typhoon to add to the chaos!\n\nBut the beauty of it is that you won&apos;t be a wee bit confused, or at any time does the story seem bloated, or sub plots unnecessary. Everything comes together in good time like clockwork, almost exactly the same experience you&apos;ll feel when boarding a plane for a trip. Working dynamics and office politics also deftly creeps into the film and presents to you the not-so-glamorous side to any job, although it does take the time to remind you that reputations that precede could also be misconstrued, and there&apos;s nothing wrong in holding back pre-judgements until you experience something yourself first hand.\n\nOpening with an inflight safety video, I like the film enough to rank it one of my favourites of this year, for being that perfect balance between comedy, drama, and that valuable look into what makes aviation tick. Highly recommended, so do flock to the only screen in Singapore that&apos;s showing this as an exclusive showcase!",

It seems that I&apos;m one of the few that enjoyed the soundtrack to the movie(I recently picked it up on LP). The songs fit the mood and had some good humor to them. Musically performed well also. I thought the set(Sweethaven), was very comical yet useable,liveable and the &quot;no sense of time&quot; previously mentioned just brings it out more. I&apos;d visit it if I were ever to travel near Malta. Shelley and Robin are the perfect pair to bring their characters life. Of course can&apos;t leave out Swee&apos;Pea. The whole cast rounds out the picture well. I guess I could get in depth and go on but I just wanted to quickly sum up my thoughts. Believe it or not--there are some big fans of this flick. I recommend this movie for anyone with a quirky sense of humor and fun. I wish this movie would be released on DVD. Behind the scenes extras would be neat."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure what made this Hitchcock thriller seem so different from his other classics. Maybe it was just simply odd to see Andrews in such a film. Maybe it was just simply odd to see Newman in such a film. Maybe it was the odd combination of Andrews and Newman together. I think it was all the above, however, it was still a very good movie.\n\nAndrews did a superb job playing the completely confused, emotionally injured, and betrayed woman. Newman was good at playing the typical American man - silent and brooding when in a very concerning situation. They&apos;re characters were played in a very honest and realistic manner, especially the scene in the farmhouse, where you can see that Newman&apos;s character, being involved in a situation where a man needed to be &apos;silenced&apos;, was in shock and didn&apos;t quite know what to do. You could tell he was thinking it was all too surreal - and due to his incapacitation, the poor farm wife had to do most of the work. One may think &apos;What a pansy&apos;, but I don&apos;t believe that most men are created to be like a James Bond character, or a professional hit-man.\n\nLila Kedrova was wonderful, as usual. She didn&apos;t need a leading role to be effective or memorable. The character of the old professor was fantastic, especially in the scene at the chalk-board, LOL!!\n\nI think this is a fine Hitchcock film that any Hitchcock lover shouldn&apos;t miss! It should have also received higher ratings!",

You really have to watch it at least twice to catch the point. Are they really aliens? Do they have a virus and need to live out their lives in plastic bubbles so as not to infect others? (I caught the fact that a virus is mentioned in a few parts in the movie) Do they have immune deficiently and have to live in a sterile environment? Or is the entire movie a metaphor for overprotective parents? As other&apos;s have pointed out there is nudity in the movie, however it is quite tame and not what most people would think when reading the reviews, and it was handled in such a way as to be both artistic, harmless, and to portray the innocence of the two--and in a way so that about a quarter of the way through the movie I stopped noticing it--and was more interested in what would happen to Tom and Lola.\n\nThe end of the movie did make me think, and I was both happy and a little sad for the both of them. I must say as a writer of Science Fiction and Fantasy I liked the movie and give credit to the film&apos;s creators, writers and actors for undertaking a very bold and interesting project.\n\nAs I said, this is a rare, interesting and visually imaginative movie, the likes of which we will probably never see again . . .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sass`, set in historic Berlin during the Twenties is an impressive movie starring the best that Germany can offer at the mo: Otto Sander, just receiving a long-awaited yet rare hommage in a monograph being released this summer, again mind-blows in a stunning performance. It´s been a clever move to cast him as supporting actor: he´s best in withdrawn but persistent roles ever since his breakthrough in Wolfgang Petersen´s &quot;Das Boot`. Moreover: German heroes Ben Becker (internationally known to cineasts since &quot;Comedian Harmonist`) and Jurgen Vogel are at their best. We can breath with these two characters, one strong and calculated, the other wild and shy simultaneously: a perfect match.\n\nDirector Carlo Rola manages to bridge this odd pair of bros. Successfully and consecutively, they melt into each other, only to find a dramatic ending that leaves us sour-sweet. But who would mind that small tear running down one´s face when leaving the screening room for another day in reality?\n\n This poetic but serious heavy weight of film sublimely gives us a spectacular glimpse of European roaring Twenties. Not to mention these beautiful actresses every human being considers a fling with. - A hard life in easy times and an easy life in hard times: &quot;Sass` is a historical lecture, generated by the movies. Yet its greatest plus is the movie´s make-up and its costumes. This look is perfectly arranged - Hollywood should open its eyes and keep one thing in mind: this piece of celluloid will be the horse conquering Troy.",

      "reviewBody": "Task Force was the first of two films Gary Cooper made regarding the development of aviation. Here he plays the fictional Jonathan Scott who looks back on his life after retiring from the Navy. The second is the Court Martial of Billy Mitchell where he plays the real life Army Aviation pioneer.\n\nFor today&apos;s fans if one wants to see where Tom Cruise and the gang from Top Gun all got their start, take a look at Task Force. The idea of a floating flattop ship from where airplanes could take off and land was one that was scoffed at post World War I. Pilots didn&apos;t have the skills yet for that. What Task Force shows is Gary Cooper and a whole bunch of other people who believed in an idea living and dying to prove that idea.\n\nTask Force was memorable in the career of Gary Cooper for two other reasons. It was the first film he did after leaving his original studio, Paramount, at Warner Brothers where he worked for about five years. It was also the last film he did with good friend Walter Brennan. They made eight joint film appearances, including some memorable ones in The Westerner and Sergeant York where they got Oscars, Brennan for The Westerner and Cooper for Sergeant York.\n\nJane Wyatt is Cooper&apos;s leading lady, playing the part of the faithful wife where if this had been made at MGM, June Allyson would have had the part. She&apos;s the widow of one of Cooper&apos;s early Navy flier friends who is killed trying to land on a new aircraft carrier.\n\nDirector Delmar Daves made good use of actual combat footage both black and white and in the last 15 minutes color. Lent a real air of authenticity to what we were viewing. Look for some good supporting performances from Brennan, Wayne Morris, Bruce Bennett and the best being an obtuse United States Senator played by Stanley Ridges.\n\nThe final shot of the film shows Cooper now in civilian attire with jets passing overhead. That was a whole new skill that had to be learned by the next generation of Top Guns. Very graphically demonstrated in The Bridges at Toko-Ri.\n\nI&apos;d like to think that Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast of Top Gun saw those two films and realized the great heritage they were now going to portray.",

      "reviewBody": "Rasputin and the Empress (1932) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nLionel, John and Ethel Barrymore star in this film, which was the only one that all three legends appeared in together. After her son is near death, Czarina Alexandria (Ethel) lets the monk Rasputin (Lionel) pray with her son who eventually heals and the monk gives credit to God. Saving her son, the monk soon finds himself gaining power inside the government but this doesn&apos;t sit well with Prince Chegodieff (John) who will stop at nothing to prove the monk is mad. Apparently MGM was sued due to how inaccurate the story is here so if you want a history lesson you should go read a book but if you want to see all three Barrymore&apos;s together then this is the only film out there that will suit you. The film should have been a lot better than it is but the thing drags at several points and I&apos;m sure fifteen or so minutes could have been trimmed from the 123-minute running time, although apparently the film ran longer when originally released. The performances aren&apos;t what you&apos;d expect but it&apos;s certainly fun seeing the three Barrymore&apos;s working together. Lionel actually goes way over the top, which is something you&apos;d expect from John but he actually manages to be quite calm and cool throughout the film. John certainly gives the best performance but it&apos;s Lionel who steals the film with his fake beard and over the top antics. Ethel is good in her role as is the supporting work from Ralph Morgan. The costumes and set design are wonderful and I really enjoyed the made up ending, which contains some pretty strong violence."

However, even the popularity in the cast of characters couldn&apos;t redeem for this low budget, cheesy and horrible of a film.\n\nThe premises on this flick is set on New Years Eve at a cinema where the forces of the ghost world wreck havoc, causing untold gore, bloodbath and nastiness.\n\nThere is really no plot to the film - just nasty stuff after nasty stuff that is supposedly to make this a good horror film. However, with no substance in the acting, storytelling and atmosphere, this film really stinks. It&apos;s definitely OK to pass on this. \n\nGrade F",

Wasn&apos;t that fun! Let&apos;s do something like that!&quot; I watched that old 60&apos;s movie all the time when I was a kid and I still get a kick out of it. While I haven&apos;t watched a lot of the old series, from what I have gathered this movie mimics it perfectly. The crazy gadgets, the silly alliterations, the kooky villains, and even the fact that they add the word &quot;bat&quot; to everything Batman creates. However, it does have a few dull spots for me and it feels like some of the ahem &quot;action&quot; sequences go on a bit too long. However, I think we need to measure a film by what it&apos;s trying to do and how well it executes it despite how it makes you feel. And since this movie is obviously trying to homage the old show as well as be it&apos;s own thing, Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders does a great job! It has an interesting story, fun characters and some great dialogue. If you wanna see a new spin on the classic Adam West Batman, then look no further!",

As opposed to most other PM films, this had little preproduction time. Rick (Pepin)&amp; Joe (Merhi) heard that the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas was going to be torn down, so we rushed over to shoot there in order to incorporate the demolition of it in the film... but it ended up being delayed by Las Vegas&apos;s Building &amp; Safety! Other problems we had... somehow we ended up with less than half the &quot;extras&quot; that we needed to fill in the audience for the fight sequences, and then a key (expensive) scene involving the villain being thrown off the Sand&apos;s top floor Penthouse didn&apos;t work out because of the bad weather... and Red Horton, our Stunt Coordinator refused to do the jump because of the wind. It eventually snowed. Sooo, all of my Art Department&apos;s budget that was spent on replicating the overhanging Portaco in the front of the hotel and the rental of dozens of huge &quot;air bags&quot; went down the toilet. We did end up shooting Red falling through the Portaco &quot;set piece&quot; I built (with the uncredited &amp; UNPAID help of Grand Master Set Builder and Special Effects Artist, Gary Kennedy) but Don &quot;overload&quot; Power screwed it all up by using WAY TOO MUCH flash powder and smoke... so that it overexposed and burned the film. You couldn&apos;t see a bloody thing on the dailies except a giant WHITE FLASH! Gee, Thanks a lot Don! Sooo, don&apos;t bother watching this, unless you&apos;re totally BORED and there&apos;s NOTHING else on the tube.",

If we look at the proliferation of this type of movies in the &apos;80s in Hong Kong, it&apos;s clear that Hui brothers were way ahead of the game.\n\nSam Hui also wrote the music for this movie. His talent is indisputable, as is his contribution to the Hong Kong&apos;s pop culture.\n\nThis is one of the seminal movie of its kind, and is recommended for viewing by all Asian movie fans.",

Emmett Walsh) but yet he seems determined to go straight. He is supposed to go to a halfway house, but the parole officer gives him one week to find a place to live and get a job. He does that - modest ones for sure, but they qualify. He also meets a girl at the employment office in whom he gets interested, a very young Theresa Russell as Jenny Mercer. Jenny seems intrigued with Max, given that he is upfront about his criminal past.\n\nThe parole officer puts Max back in jail for suspicion of drug abuse, and after his urine test comes back clean he is released, but he has lost his job and his room. Max decides to get even with this guy and, on the way to the halfway house, commandeers the car, drags out the parole officer, and handcuffs him to a fence next to the highway with his pants around his ankles. Max takes off in his car and it is clear LA hasn&apos;t changed that much in 45 years as nobody comes to the officer&apos;s immediate aid. Max is now forced to go back to a life of crime, but it doesn&apos;t seem like he needs that much prodding. Complications ensue.\n\nYou&apos;re not sure who the real Max Dembo is. You meet all of his friends, ex-cons themselves, and they are as complex as Max is. They have working class lives with kids, wives, and cookouts, but don&apos;t need the hard sell to decide to go back to crime. It&apos;s not a hard decision for any of them. And you can see how they all got apprehended in the past - they all have their rash, greedy, and violent sides.\n\nYou never meet any of Max&apos;s family of origin. Being in his 30s you have no idea if he ever had enough time on the outside to make some kind of family of his own. Neither is ever mentioned. So he is a complete enigma, known only by what we see in this film and his criminal history, which is shown in the end credits. It&apos;s a very gritty crime film and character study, and a good example of what kind of films could be made after the production code completely collapsed that would have been hard to make just ten years before when it had only recently been disposed of.",

Murphy is great in this role, funny and full of hilarious one-liners. The film is written well, very funny, direction is decent and acting is good for the most part. Although Givens is not the best female lead, Halle Berry was great in her role. Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock were absolutely hilarious, and David Alan Grier was good as well. The film is not to be taken to seriously, and although not at the caliber of Murphy favs of mine &quot;coming to America&quot; and &quot; beverly hills cop&quot;, Boomerang is still a must-see for any Eddie Murphy fan. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Deadly Bees would be much more aptly titled were it called The Deadly Bore. Made by the company Amicus (a half-hearted sixties rival to Hammer) and directed by the usually reliable Freddie Francis, this is a truly terrible film.\n\nSuzanna Leigh looks pretty but acts badly as a pop star suffering from exhaustion. Her agent sends her to Seagull Island to recover, and she finds herself lodging at a strange, isolated little farm run by Guy Doleman and his unhappy wife. Doleman breeds bees, as does nearby resident Frank Finlay, and things start to go wrong when a mutant breed of killer bee begins to attack and kill people and animals on the island. Finlay persuades Leigh that the bees responsible have been bred by Doleman, and solicits her help in gathering evidence to have him arrested.\n\nThe special effects are pitiful. The bee attacks look so unconvincing that they provoke humour rather than terror. All right, so it&apos;s a limited budget 60s film, so the effects are hardly likely to be the best, but surely they could&apos;ve done better than this! Furthermore, the characters make no sense whatsoever. For instance, some of the events going on simply don&apos;t seem to perturb Doleman in the slightest; Leigh reacts strangely much of the time; and Finlay&apos;s character seems to be a different person from one scene to the next. Even the &quot;shock&quot; twist at the end is telegraphed miles in advance. I won&apos;t reveal the solution here, but as you&apos;re watching this film the likelihood is that you&apos;ll figure out what&apos;s going on long before the heroine does!"

When i read the synopsis of this particular one, i thought, &apos;this could be a good one&apos;. But unfortunately, I was disappointed. Theron and Townsend seem as if they are worried too much of showing their real life emotions for each other throughout the film. The whole thing hardly ever connects well. I do like the fact that they spoke the original languages, I appreciate that concept and also, the costume designer did a wonderful job. Nevertheless, Charlize and Stewart look bored through the whole thing, and she also seems as if she is reading her lines from the palm of her hand. The emotions just AREN&apos;T convincing enough."

      "reviewBody": "Having been grossly mislead into seeing this film due to its rating, I was expecting a good watch.\n\nHowever from the initial opening of a woman committing suicide by jumping from the top of a building, I quickly flashed back to the scene in The Grudge where Peter (Bill Pullman) takes his own life in a similar fashion.\n\nAs the opening credits appear in the film you see the trademark long black hairs ditto The Grudge opening credits. At this point I was thinking to myself that I had made a BIG mistake.\n\nThis film also borrows from 1408(2007) where Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is trapped inside a haunted room and unable to escape it. In this film the character played by Jimmy Shergill is also unable to leave his flat as he is trapped by a ghost who haunts it.\n\nAlso the ghost is also copied (stolen is a better word) exactly from The Grudge. \n\nPlot of film: Rahul (Jimmy Shergill) arrives from U.S. to make amends with his love, Preeti (Kaveri Jha) in India. He buys a flat from his long time friend.\n\nHis dad (Sachin Khedekar), dies under mysterious circumstances when he visits the flat, followed by the baffling disappearance of Preeti. And soon Rahul finds himself trapped in his own flat, completely cut off from the world. The only companion he has is a ghost. \n\nThe ghost is of a woman who had been cheated into false marriage, unknowing that the man she was about to marry had already been married. And then when she got pregnant, her husband brought in a doctor that specialized in illegal abortions. During the abortion she dies, and her husband hides her body within a wall in the flat and then plastering it up with cement so no one would notice when he sold the flat. \n\nNow this ghost wants revenge at any cost. In order to lure her husband, she uses Rahul as her tool. \n\nBottom line: if after reading the plot you STILL want to SEE this film, go right ahead! The only horror films that are halfway decent and at least worth the money spent on it are those directed by Vikram Bhatt. Shaapit and 1920 are good examples of watchable horror films. \n\nEmail me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movie recommendations. Have a nice day :)",

      "reviewBody": "What a cast! Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, Dick VanDyke, Mickey Roney, Bill Cobbs...\n\nI&apos;m not a Stiller fan, but in this one he was really great, he steps out of his usual shtick to really anchor this movie. For once he doesn&apos;t seem to be trying too hard and avoids overdoing it.\n\nThis is one of Robin Williams&apos; better modern roles, he&apos;s toned down but still quintessentially Williams. It was nice to see him in a role that he can both take seriously *and* have some fun with it.\n\nOwen Wilson is still awesome, basically reprising his Shanghai Noon character, but with a cute, rather unexpected twist.\n\nDick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are classic, they haven&apos;t lost a step. Rooney is still the little bantam rooster with the attitude! Van Dyke clearly anchors the trio. Cobbs wasn&apos;t given much to work with for his character, but his quality shines through. These veteran comedic actors bring a bit of class and legitimacy to the film.\n\nThe movie is well paced, jumping almost directly into the action, with plenty of laughs. From Rexie&apos;s puppy-dog antics to the war between Old West Cowboys and Roman Centurians, there is something around every corner.\n\nThe only stinker in this film is the kid. He&apos;s totally under-utilized for the storyline, they could have improved the storyline by either leaving the kid out of the movie entirely, or by giving him something to do. The pseudo-love-interest, too, should have either been played up or left out.\n\nThis is an entirely enjoyable family film. My 87 year old grandmother-in-law loved it, as did my 9 year old daughter and my teenage sons! Truly something for everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "It is a well known fact that Udhaar Ki Zindagi is copied from a South Indian film. But it&apos;s the bravura performance of the film&apos;s leading lady, Kajol that saves the film from going into slumps. Kajol was flying high these days with the success of Baazigar and UKZ further solidifies her position in Bollywood as a heroine of substance.\n\nKajol is wonderful from the very first frame of the movie. The film is basically about a granddaughter&apos;s (Kajol) constant struggles to placate her angry grandfather played by Jeetendra. The reason that Jeetendra is angry at Kajol is because his son married a girl whom he didn&apos;t approve of. Kajol&apos;s father then walks out on Jeetendra and settles down in USA. Years later, Kajol comes back to India but with a secret whom she&apos;s dead scared to disclose to anyone, including her doting grandmother played by Moushumi Chatterjee.\n\nAs mentioned above, Kajol is magnificent in this movie. The sincerity with which she portrays her character shows off in many scenes. Her character Sita&apos;s expression of frustration, sadness, happiness and vanity is well conveyed by Kajol. Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee&apos;s chemistry is excellent and the couple look too good on screen. Moushumi Chatterjee portrays her character with grace and a certain amount of vulnerability. Ravi Kishen as Jeetendra&apos;s son was good. Rohit Bhatia as the leading lady&apos;s love interest is strictly okay. Given the fact that it&apos;s a heroine-driven film, the hero had nothing worth mentioning to do.\n\nThe music of UKZ is heartwarming, especially &quot;thodi haasi thode ansoo&quot;. This song is amazingly picturized and really unfolds the essence of the film. Other songs of this film are good too.\n\nOverall, a must-watch for Kajol&apos;s fans."

      "name": "A step up from the first... but a pretty small one",
      "reviewBody": "When The Olsen Gang became a franchise, writers Bahs and Balling were quick to eliminate characters that were deemed unnecessary or simply didn&apos;t seem to make sense, in that the gang continues their adventures... gone are the hookers from Hansen&apos;s bar, Benny&apos;s fiancée Ulla and the two other kids in the Jensen estate... Børge remains, as the only kid of Kjeld and Yvonne. The acting starts to find a more grounded level, instead of always being so incredibly overplayed. Dynamite-Harry(portrayed by none other than Preben Kaas; who could possibly play a major drunk better than one who is(well, was... RIP) one, in real life?), Benny&apos;s hopeless drunk of a brother(who is, of course, very skilled in the use of explosives) is introduced. The series moves towards the great films that we have come to know it for. The humor is still mostly silly... still containing a few mix-ups, as well, though most of these are much funnier and so infrequent, they manage to surprise you(rather than annoy you, as got to be the case with those of the first). The plot is an interesting case; not so much for the writing itself(certainly not, it&apos;s quite pedestrian, not at all up to the level of some of the later films), but for how early the idea it presents came about in the series. The Gang going straight... no more crime... with the added twist that they are framed for a robbery they didn&apos;t(but certainly could have) commit. Added to the cast are now the well-known Ghita Nørby as the young, female social worker of Egon(who has a school-boy crush on her... illustrated by the seemingly angelic light that appears around her person many of the times he looks at her... believe me, it&apos;s funnier than it sounds) who helps the three &quot;career criminals&quot;(before Danish audiences knew and saw them as such) getting real jobs. Most of the jokes about about pornography are absent... as is the (let&apos;s face it) gratuitous half-nude women. In their place are more of the social commentary and satire that the first showed signs of, and that we know and love the later films for(along with the daring heists, the human touch and the energy). Authority is made fun of yet again(though less bombastically), and this time, German discipline and rehabilitation/psychology are thrown into the mix, too. Usually funny, and more often than not, hysterically so. This is also when the series start to feature longer films... the first was an hour and 20 minutes, this clocks in at not much less than two full hours. Arguably, much of this time could one do without... the scene at the bar featuring the gang, Harry and Mrs. Hansen, the social worker(and a scene or two immediately following it) is too long and could easily be cut without it detracting from the overall experience(opposite that, however, are the delightful scenes at the toy factory, which are among the funniest in the series). But this is still a step up. A step further away from the mediocrity of not only the first film, but most other Danish films of the period. It wasn&apos;t until later that this series really started to stand out, but this is still a step, and one in the right direction(it&apos;s always annoying when franchises start to step away from the path it really should stay on). A few key ingredients are still missing, and, overall, this film just isn&apos;t really much better than the first. It&apos;s still worth watching, at least to those who want to see how it all started. I recommend this to the biggest fans of the series and those who want to observe the roots of it. As a bonus, Poul Bundgaard shows off some of his talent as an opera singer in this film. Also, this has a fairly good amount of James Bond-ian gadgets... for anyone who enjoys seeing that in movies. 6/10",

      "name": "A review from a true gore fan meant for other true gore fans.",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m going to say something that I&apos;ve seen very few reviews anywhere say: Guinea Pig: Flowers of Flesh and Blood really, simply is NOT that gory. Do not misunderstand me. I&apos;m not one of the countless reviewers who are complaining this movie didn&apos;t look realistic. Some of those people wouldn&apos;t think a real body being cut up looked realistic if they didn&apos;t know it was real. What I&apos;m saying is, the actual events depicted on screen simply weren&apos;t all that gory or sick. Not by today&apos;s standards.\n\nIt&apos;s a sad little world when you read the internet nerds who hide behind a cheesy screen name and trash modern torture movies because they&apos;re not gory enough for their supposed juggernaut balls. Most of them speak with elegance, spouting off the names of obscure Japanese movies that are &quot;So sick!&quot; and &quot;Make Hostel look like a family movie!&quot; Put simply: They&apos;re almost always wrong. What&apos;s sadder than that is that most people don&apos;t realize their wrong, even after they watch oh-so-sick obscure movie and shyly realize they&apos;ve seen worse on the Saw promo posters, but would never admit it because it would mean going against the self-proclaimed film buffs.\n\nThat is why I&apos;m here to stand against the crowd and say what needs to be said. Flowers of Flesh and Blood is not the goriest movie of all time. For someone who&apos;s seen modern torture movies, it&apos;s not even that gory at all, and here is why . . .\n\nFirst and foremost, as has been stated by almost everyone, this movie has no plot. It&apos;s pure fake snuff from open to close. I have absolutely nothing against that at all. While it was too tame for me to fully enjoy, the lack of a plot made the film very intense and easy to sit through without getting bored. On the other hand, however, the lack of a plot made the film seem a lot more brutal than it actually was. If you were to take any of the five Saw films and cut out every minute except the pure gore, all of them would seem just as intense, if not more intense, than Flowers of Flesh and Blood. If you were to add forty more minutes of plot to Flowers of Flesh and Blood, it would seem just just as tame as all the Hollywood torture films that the self-proclaimed film buffs all call tame. Don&apos;t mistake intensity for gore.\n\nSecond, Flowers of Flesh and Blood isn&apos;t something you can just walk to the local video store and get five copies of. It&apos;s nowhere even slightly as well-known as Saw and Hostel. The obscurity is something self-proclaimed film buffs have always fed off of, and if this were something you could easily pick up, the same self-proclaimed film buffs wouldn&apos;t even consider it gory. You see, it&apos;s not about content, it&apos;s all about lack of popularity that builds a false hype. Likewise, whenever someone says, for example, that Ichi the Killer is &quot;The sickest movie I&apos;ve ever seen!&quot;, the self-proclaimed film buffs all jump on his back and say they found it tame, even if they really didn&apos;t. Then they say something like, &quot;But, man, go watch Flowers of Flesh and Bloodnow there is a sick movie!&quot; Again, the lesser known name build the hype.\n\nThird, the gore content is simply uncreative. Standard limbs are severed as in every other standard gore movie ever. The only difference here is that the cameraman goes into ultra close-ups every few seconds to give the illusion that this movie is actually doing something that hasn&apos;t been done thousands of times.There were at least ten spots in the movie where my own mind went into things that could have been done to make the scene four times as gory, but the director doesn&apos;t even have half that imagination or balls. He stuck to the generic, seen-it-a-thousand-times gore scenes. That alone makes this inferior to the Saw and Hostel series as far as gore goes, not to mention inferior to the countless other modern films like The Decent and Inside. Point blank: there is nothing here that is sadistic or even that gory. Sadism implies that gore has creativity, and that is a total joke here. Gore implies that something is brutal and bloody, and, as I&apos;ve said, compared to modern movies, this is fairly average.\n\nDon&apos;t believe the hype that this is oh-so-gory.\n\nOn a technical level, the acting from the main villain a joke, as I think it was meant to be. The acting from the woman was very believable. The ultra close-ups became cheesy. The gore effects are nothing compared to the French gore film Inside, but I never once thought they lacked enough realism to become laughable, as some reviewers stated. You have to remember, also, that most of the reviewers who say they laughed at this movie are most likely saying that to overlook that they have weak stomachs. It&apos;s common.\n\nOn an entertainment level, I found this movie to be very much worth a watch, and very entertaining. I give it credit for the intensity. The only plot point in the film, that the killer only kills women, is a outright cliché, but it doesn&apos;t bear anything on the actual film.\n\nOverall, Flowers of Flesh and Blood is a fun little torture film that lacks anything truly disturbing or gory, but is worth the watch if you&apos;re a gore fan. I&apos;m really just sick of people hyping this to be so much gorier than the Hollywood norm, because it simply is not. The first five minutes of Saw IV alone, the autopsy scene, had every single thing this movie had. When it comes to the world of gore, this is the single most overrated film of all time.\n\n4/10",

It is a gory, sleazy and silly movie...\n\nAnd, I mean that in a good way. The actors don&apos;t seem to know that they are in a low budget movie. Some even seem unaware of the fact that they cannot act and TRY anyway. It is beautiful in its way.\n\nThe makeup and special effects are pretty bad. The ape-man looks as if someone slapped a mud pack on a professional wrestler. Later, cheesy looking fangs are added, possibly to show that his heart had been replaced again...possibly to show that the makeup man had a very short train of thought.\n\nThe biggest waste in this movie is the lady wrestler who is contemplating retirement after putting an opponent into a coma. She is on the periphery of the plot...a plot where, for example, in the Santos movies, wrestling could&apos;ve played a large part. I was unhappy not to see her in action against the ape-man...\n\nThe actors are generally sincere. The doctor does an excellent job. The zaftig nudity of a lady wrestler is also a welcome change from the anorexia we are forced to consume in today&apos;s sleaze.\n\nBut this movie is BLOODY. Many scenes are simply stock footage taken from heart operations. But there are gougings, scalping&apos;s, detoothings and squishings. None of these injuries look particularly authentic; but, the thought of them might be offensive to some. Definitely, this is an adult movie...\n\nFor sheer fun, I gave this movie a seven.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Die Schulmädchen vom Treffpunkt Zoo&quot; seems like such an obvious rip-off of &quot;Christiane F.&quot; that I was surprised to find it came out two years before that film. The book of &quot;Christiane F.&quot; had come out the year before, though, so I can only assume they were inspired by that publishing phenom, an interview with the titular Christiane that was only supposed to take two hours for a magazine article, but stretched on for two months and was turned into a book, a movie, and a miniseries, so indelible was Christiane&apos;s story.\n\nThe film of &quot;Christiane F.&quot; is so grim and harrowing that it makes &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; look like &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Weird, then, that sexploitation filmmaker Walter Boos sought to turn this into another soft porn flick, like the infamous &quot;Schoolgirl Report&quot; series he had also worked on. The movie weaves its tale of the young (allegedly only eleven years old when this was filmed!) Katja Bienert character, a girl with links to the sex industry and a junkie hustler boyfriend she seeks to support. You can see where this is going right away, can&apos;t you?\n\nThe movie also interweaves some stock plots from the &quot;Report&quot; series, ie. A schoolgirl attempting to blackmail a teacher with her sex appeal, and a slapstick sequence in which a shy boy is about to lose his virginity but accidentally drenches himself and his conquest in paint.\n\nAs far as they go, &quot;Die Schulmädchen vom Treffpunkt Zoo&quot; is one of the better sexploitation flicks I have seen, not just from Germany or the &apos;70s, but from any place or era. The troublingly young Katja Bienert, who looks in her late teens, creates a character we care about, as does the young man who tries to woo her. The ending is surprisingly emotive. Unfortunately, as is the ironic norm for sexploitation, the movie isn&apos;t really erotic. There is little anticipation of sex/nudity when characters just appear nude from scene-to-scene.",

I adored the slower pace of the movie because it felt like it gave me a chance to breathe, to enjoy the gorgeous scenery, and sink into the feeling of the movie. It was wonderfully nostalgic of many of the things I experienced on a trip to Egypt I took 2 years ago, and I found myself laughing out loud a few times, remembering.\n\nI was also reminded of the allure of Egyptian men - yes, they are very obvious, in-your-face, and verbal to women, which I&apos;m not used to as a Canadian woman. Yet paradoxically, many are very much gentlemen, cordial. I liked seeing this in Tareq&apos;s character, as he put Juliette on a pedestal which you really come to feel she deserves.\n\nI also liked how the love story was actually quite innocent and told a story of pure love and appreciation for a fellow human being. It felt like it portrayed exactly those moments of stillness and deep feeling that we only share with select few in our lifetimes. Experiences that we recall with our eyes closed...like secret, subtle moments the heart remembers and cherishes.",

      "reviewBody": "This certainly lived up to expectations of being &quot;a nice movie,&quot; an involving story about a young Mexican boy who sneaks into the United States to try to find his mother in Los Angeles. She had been in L.A. for four years and, frankly, I forget why. They don&apos;t dwell on that, but there must have been a good reason since she loves the kid and vice-versa. Each Sunday morning at 10, she calls him from the same spot. That&apos;s a key to the story.\n\nWhen the woman&apos;s mother dies, &quot;Carlito&apos;s&quot; grandmother who had been looking after the young boy, the kid decides his options aren&apos;t good at that point and he needs to take a big chance to see if he can find his way to Los Angeles. Yes, you have to suspend your beliefs here a bit, as the odds on a kid actually being able to do that - all with no money! - are astronomical, but it&apos;s fun to watch him on his journey and how he makes do with what little he has. Some of the friendships he makes are truly touching and in a way, the best part of the film.\n\nWhile writing this, it makes me flashback to the film &quot;The Straight Story&quot; when an old man on a tractor drives 300 miles across Iowa to see his long-lost brother. He is befriended by many people along the way, some who go to extraordinary lengths to help a stranger. That&apos;s the case here, too.\n\nWe also get a good profile of the mother, her best friend and a wonderful man she meets during this story, which takes place in one week. Each &quot;chapter&quot; of the film is broken down into days. Yes, the film is slightly preachy concerning immigration but the story is so good that one forgets about the political aspect, no matter side one is on.\n\nThis is a pretty solidly-made film, from directing to acting to the visuals but it&apos;s the story that will hook you in early on and you aren&apos;t able to let go until the end. The last half hour will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering exactly things how will turn out. That&apos;s good, because it means the movie is entertaining. Definitely recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie shows off some fine performances and pleasant music but the screenplay could have been better. It revolves around a &apos;chawl&apos; neighborhood at the center of which live two brothers. The relationships between the characters were portrayed nicely e.g. how Soman&apos;s father confides in Raj and shares his disappointment, how the neighborhood comes to one another&apos;s need etc. Ajay Devgan delivers a decent performance while Namrata Shirodkar shines in her role. She has done a great job of portraying her character&apos;s despair. She&apos;s always there for Raj and Rahul and she yearns for Raj&apos;s love but since he can&apos;t reciprocate her feelings, she gradually walks a path of self-destruction. Sonali Bendre is brilliant, nonetheless. Her character has suffered hardship in the past (this is mildly referred) and now she makes her decisions based on practical thinking. She too loves Raj but she won&apos;t accept Raj&apos;s very limited devotion. Shivaji Sattam does very well and Reema Laggo portrays her character&apos;s metamorphosis wonderfully (but she is a little annoying in the beginning). Anand Raaj Anand&apos;s music is pleasant but some of the songs could have been easily left out as it slows down the pace. The film tries to show that love and care is all what one needs (at least in the case of the two brothers) and hence, why admit the handicapped brother to an institution? The way the institution was presented, with all the patients wearing some kind of uniform, was ridiculous. But why not rehabilitate the handicapped brother and provide him enough love and care? There&apos;s no need to admit him in an institution but he can still receive training and achieve some level of independence. But no, none of that is mentioned. As with a majority of Bollywood movies, this also tends to be melodramatic to some extent. Though I&apos;d still say you could watch it for some fine performances, good music and to feel good."

The title should have been, in my opinion, &apos; Villa Triste &apos; as it is not only a better title ( based on Patrick Modiano&apos;s novel ) but because who cares or knows what perfume Yvonne wears ? I only watched the film as I like Modiano&apos;s work, and as I have not read this specific one I hoped for better. I am convinced the book has more merit than Patrice Leconte&apos;s film. Bad things first. Sandra Majon was one of the most tepid actors I have ever seen, and in this film the passivity of Hippolyte Girardot&apos;s acting in a complex role was in my opinion quite simply lazy. And then there is a sad old homosexual played by Jean-Pierre Marielle that showed off every pathetic gesture that presumably the director thought every ageing homosexual should, or does have. The music is relentlessly soft focussed when it is not maudlin, and so is the camera work in far too many scenes. Now for the good points. It does have a few powerful scenes and to avoid spoilers the Algerian War raging in France in 1958 was sometimes put to the foreground and the regret of wasted and passing years movingly shown. I do not want to give away more except to say the &apos; erotic &apos; scenes were dull, and repetitious and totally unconvincing. I give it a 5 for an attempt to put a Modiano book on screen, and for the ambiguity of motives adequately conveyed. As I said my opinion of this film is in the balance, but with more thought probably veering towards the bad.",

His gentle alien comes in the form of a human clone (Jeff Bridges), and as we watch him interact with the rest of our race, we see both the good and the bad in all of us.  It is this particular role that I find to be Jeff Bridge&apos;s most superb acting (or close to it, given his amazing work in &apos;The Fisher King&apos;).  To me he always did seem an alien in an unfamiliar human body, rather than the actor &quot;Jeff Bridges&quot;.  While there is certainly some over-simplification in the movie, and it can get a little sappy, I find the &apos;sap&apos; in this case to be both touching and beautiful.  How wonderful, how sad, how miraculous, to watch ourselves through the innocent and wise eyes of this alien being.  A brilliant look at human beings, a sweet love story, and an excellent exploration of our spirit.",

The story is extremely complex and long, and even so director Breno Silveira manages to tell it in a very clear way, with lots of details and beautiful interpretations and cinematography.\n\nOne of the main points that made people overlook the movie was that they focused too much on Zezé di Camargo and Luciano. The movie is not about them, but their father, a very poor and illiterate man who simply decided that his sons would have a better life than his. Francisco&apos;s stubbornness is amazing, and his unbeatable faith should be more imitated than laughed at.\n\nAn excellent movie for all ages, very entertaining and moving, and a lovely soundtrack, built mostly with old classics of Brazilian country music.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not a big fan of fifties monster movies in general, but this one is pretty decent. The film was directed by Riccardo Freda, although he was going under the pseudonym &apos;Robert Hamton&apos; in order to fool audiences into thinking that the film was an American picture. The film does take obvious influence from the American monster movies and is similar in style, plot and execution; and actually credit does have to go to Freda in that respect as if it wasn&apos;t for the awful dubbing, one would have no reason to think that this wasn&apos;t an American film. The plot is rather well worked and focuses on the demise of the Mayan civilisation. We focus on a team of archaeologists studying some ancient Mayan ruins when they come across a cave which houses a lake. After diving into the lake, they discover that it is full of gold; although things go a bit awry when they also find out that the lake is inhabited by an ancient blob-like monster. They end up taking part of the creature back to the lab where upon studying it, they realise it could threaten the whole world...\n\nIt was unveiled that many of the films which Riccardo Freda took credit for were actually directed by his young apprentice, Mario Bava - and Caltiki is one of those films. I have no idea how much of the film was directed by Bava, but I&apos;d hesitantly say that I think it was mostly done by Freda as the film does not feature much in the way of Bava&apos;s trademark styling&apos;s; although in truth the filming style is all very by the numbers and there&apos;s not a lot of room for stylish visuals. The plot is well done, however, and is certainly more inventive than I thought it might be. The special effects are not particularly spectacular; though they certainly are serviceable for the type of film and are used well. There are a handful of good ideas on display - the fate that awaits a particularly greedy archaeologist being one of the best parts of it. The film tries to a bit spectacular towards the end, and it does work somewhat, although many of the American pictures did the spectacular ending better. Still, this is a decent little monster movie and I&apos;m sure fans of this stuff will enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer will make the typical teenage fan of Freddy or Jason s*** their pants. Or maybe not. Maybe this might actually, when it&apos;s not ratcheting up the precisely random violence and kills, bore some of the younger audience looking for stupid characters doing stupid things and getting killed by a bogeyman. Henry, based on real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, wasn&apos;t a bogeyman. He was more like your friend who is usually bored every other night and goes out to do something. But that something, instead of like going to a bar or a movie or a show, is killing people, whomever, as long as it&apos;s not too obvious (never using a gun twice, and proper disposal of bodies, is some advice given by Henry), with a hapless dumb-ass, Otis, usually in tow.\n\nWhat makes it so unnerving is how McNaughton chooses to just show his protagonist doing these things, without passing any judgment exactly. Perhaps some did think judgment was passed somehow, or that the controversy came from just showing a killer as is, and without proper law and order about (a cop car shows up literally once, for a goof). It&apos;s a downright sad and vicious bastard of a movie, showing the primitive horrorshow of, say, the massacre of the wife, husband and child, as seen through the staggering hand-held vision of the camcorder that Henry is operating while he and Otis do the slaughter. And yet for all the horrible things they do- and, arguably, Otis does worse ultimately, if only by way of Becky- they&apos;re never shown as caricatures, or as supernatural creatures. They&apos;re just killers, doing it for the hell of it, or, perhaps as reason Henry gives, &apos;do it before they do it to you&apos; (this also goes for defenseless hookers).\n\nIt might not be entirely a great movie - it&apos;s shot roughly and some of the editing is crude and the use of music and sound effects (yes, sound effects) is cheesy and a little laughable, not to mention the shoe-string special effects and make-up - but it&apos;s got great things about it, memorable notes to take. Tom Towles is excellent as a downright creep of a human being, while Michael Rooker does perfectly as a tortured soul who, as Henry, just does what he does, though at the same time was, at one point, a victim himself from his mother (who, apparently, he also killed). Some vulnerability is found with the Becky character, though Arnold&apos; performance is just passable.\n\nWhat makes the movie for me is Rooker&apos;s hold on the character, so dark and deep and scary that you can feel your skin crawl knowing he could just snap at any moment (albeit not as awful as Otis, in a weird way), and McNaughton&apos;s lack of easy answers - certainly not with the ending, which is equally bizarre and chilling. A minor cult item to take note of: it&apos;s the kind of movie I always saw on the video shelf in the horror section as a kid, looking dangerous with Rooker leering at the mirror and a warning on the video box. Now I know why.",

Some comments to this forum have compared it to other distinguished films like Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Michaelangelo Antonioni&apos;s &quot;Blow Up&quot;, a comparison that seems to make sense, in a way, but Mr. DePalma, who wrote his own screen play, is an intelligent man who didn&apos;t need to copy anything from those masters of the cinema.\n\nIn fact, &quot;Blow Out&quot; has kept its impact as a thriller mystery with its political overtones as it mixes crime with the lives of influential people that might give viewers a point of reference between the movie and actual historical facts.\n\nWe are given an introduction to Jack&apos;s line of work as we watch scenes of the porno film that he is working on as a sound technician. The only thing that is needed is a real scream which the many actresses, either on the film itself, or being auditioned, can&apos;t produce. Whatever comes out of those women&apos;s throats are wimpy sounds, not a horror yell for help.\n\nJack, who is out one night recording sounds for future ventures, captures the shot that causes the &quot;blow out&quot; and makes a car plunge into a creek. Jack abandons everything and jumps to rescue whoever he can save. He is only successful in bringing Sally out of the water. This is the beginning of Jack&apos;s involvement into the mystery behind the actual fact.\n\nMr. DePalma&apos;s thriller is visually stylish. He photographed the movie in Philadelphia. The film has the excellent Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera. The atmospheric music by Pino Donoggio serves the movie well.\n\nJohn Travolta&apos;s career was in decline when he made this movie. He gives a terrific performance as the sound effect man who stumbles in a conspiracy to eliminate the witnesses to the accident. Nancy Allen is not as effective as Sally, the young prostitute at the center of the story. Being married to the director might have helped her land the part, which with some other actress might have paid off better. John Lighgow is perfectly creepy as Burke, the evil man. Dennis Franz has the pivotal part of Karp, the man who was able to photograph the whole incident.\n\n&quot;Blow Out&quot; is a must see for all Brian DePalma&apos;s admirers.",

There are some flicks that you don&apos;t have to take seriously and all you have to do is sit back and have fun watching. Sure, its silly but most 50&apos;s sci-fi is. Why is this worse than others? The music that is used is from other Arnold films most notably &quot;Tarantula&quot; and I&apos;m sure Universal used the same score for countless other movies. A lot of Arnold regulars pop up like Whit Bissell, Phil Harvey, Ross Elliott, Richard Cutting and of course Mr. Ziffel, Hank Patterson! Eddie Parker plays the monster here in make-up, not Arthur Franz and Parker was also in &quot;Tarantula&quot; in two roles. Both as lab assistance who die of that deforming disease. Troy Donahue in one of his early roles is Jimmy and he&apos;s especially wooden. But Arnold knows exactly how to tell a story no matter how silly and the scene with the giant dragonfly is fun, so is the whole movie.",

It&apos;s the Darkwolf, a vicious werewolf with a thirst for blood ~ and a lust for Josie, a sexy, unsuspecting woman with a mysterious power she in only beginning to understand. once the Darkwolf catches Josie&apos;s scent, nothing can stop his insatiable hunger to mate with her....and he&apos;ll kill anyone who gets in the way!!\n\n Overview : This movie did have some potential but it was lost somewhere along the way. The movie did move smoothly from beginning to end and the story was decent, but the acting suffered and the special effects weren&apos;t very special at all. The transformation scenes from human to wolf made me feel I just jumped into an XBOX game as I looked around for my controller. I did enjoy the few scenes were we SEE the wolf and the leftovers it strew behind him but that alone wasn&apos;t strong enough to hold this movie together.\n\n Jekyll&apos;s Rating : Some people are fans when it comes to the direct to video movies...I suppose I am not one of them. This one gets a 2 star rating from me....get it as cheap as possible if you must."

We have a very young and beautiful Daliah Lavi in the role of a very curious reporter and at the same time the daughter of a scientist, we have the natural and very convincing Gert Fröbe as Kommissar Lohmann and Lex Barker as a FBI agent and the excellent experts in villainous roles Werner Peters as Böhmler and Wolfgang Preiss as Dr. Mabuse. And Peter Sandloff&apos;s music is good, he being also the author of the music for &quot;Die unsichtbaren Krallen des Dr. Mabuse&quot; (1962).",

The famous Tempelhof airport is setting for six individuals who are stuck in the building, because of deep fog.  No aircraft can take off. &quot;Not even the Russians would dare to fly out&quot; - quote. Shot in beautiful ultravision - cinemascope - with a sexy Jazz music by composer Peter Thomas, you can breath the 1960s mood of Berlin.

      "name": "Biopic  shot in Spain  about the last Russian Czar with historical detail , luxurious sets and outstanding acting",
      "reviewBody": "Historical film correctly based on real events about Russian CZar Nicholas II (Michael Jayston , though press reports at time of pre-production said that Rex Harrison) , wife (first cinema film of Janet Suzman , and Audrey Hepburn and Vanessa Redgrave considered to play Alexandra) and sons Aleksey Nikolaeyvitch Romanov (Roderic Noble was chosen due to his resemblance) , Anastasia (Fiona Fullerton who had an interesting career as teen) , Tatiana (Lynne Frederick who subsequently married and inherited to Peter Sellers but she died early) . Czar Nicholas II, the inept monarch of Russia , insensitive to the needs of his country , is overthrown and exiled to Siberia with his family . In the film appears several historic personages as Kerenski (John McEnery) , The Queen Mother Marie Fedorovna (Irene Worth) , Trostki (film debut of Brian Cox) , Lenin (Michael Bryant) , Stalin (Hizeldine) , Rasputin (it was Laurence Olivier who first suggested Tom Baker to be cast and Peter O&apos;Toole was asked to play Rasputin) , he was killed by Prince Yussoupov (Martin Potter) \n\nThis overlong film contains drama , emotion and notorious deeds dealing with the over-detailed depiction of happenings preceding Russian Revolution until the deaths of Czar and family . Gorgeous sets and spectacular production design by John Box and Gil Parrondo ; being mostly filmed in Spain , as the Royal Palace of Madrid . It&apos;s marvellously photographed by Freddie Young in magnificence color . Evocative and sensitive musical score by Richard Rodney Bennnett . The picture is well directed by Franklin J. Schaffner . He directed excellent motion pictures as &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Patton,&quot; &quot;Papillon&quot;, ¨&quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, after the flop of his film titled &quot; Islands in the Stream &quot;, in which went on to coincide with the actor of &quot;Patton,&quot; George C. Scott, decided to embark on a project more commercial and successful as &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; , however ¨Sphinx¨ ,¨Lionheart¨, ¨Si Giorgio¨were others flops . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching \n\nThe picture based on facts , it begins when Japan&apos;s own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland. Russia is involved in a costly war with Japan over the Korean peninsula and the Czar rejects all recommendations that he bring the war to an end. War began in 1904 with a surprise Japanese attack on the Russian fleet in Port Arthur, without formal declaration of war and Russia is defeated by Japan . The Romanovs (Michael Jayston, Janet Suzman) are absolute rulers, among the last of their kind in Europe, living in luxury while the vast majority of Russians live in absolute poverty and take place revolts . As on January 1905 , Gapon (Julian Glover) began his march . Locking arms, the workers marched peacefully through the streets. Some carried religious icons and banners, as well as national flags and portraits of the Tsar. As they walked they sang religious hymns and the Imperial anthem, &apos;God Save The CZar&apos;. All of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the Winter Palace . Throughout the city, the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry, backed by Cossacks and Hussars; and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd . The official number of victims was 92 dead and several hundred wounded. By the time of Stolypin (Eric Porter)&apos;s assassination by Dmitry Bogrov, a student in a theatre in Kiev on 18 September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office . Because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose not to divulge Alexei&apos;s condition to anyone outside the royal household. In fact, there were many in the Imperial household who were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich&apos;s illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men . One of these was an illiterate Siberian , Grigori Rasputin (Tom Baker) , appeared to have some success. Rasputin&apos;s influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar, had grown stronger ever since 1912, when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at Bialowieza and Spala ,now part of Poland . The Czar&apos;s decision, against advice, to authorize a general mobilization in 1914 leads to disaster on the front . As the government failed to produce supplies, there was mounting hardship creating massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front in 1915, authority appeared to collapse , while Empress Alexandra ran the government from Petrograd from 1915 , and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers . At the end of the &quot;February Revolution&quot; of 1917 , Nicholas II chose to abdicate . He firstly abdicated in favour of Tsarevich Alexei, but swiftly changed his mind after advice from doctors that the heir-apparent would not live long apart from his parents who would be forced into exile .The abdication of Nicholas II and the subsequent Bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty&apos;s rule to an end. The fall of autocratic Tsardom brought joy to Liberals and Socialists in Britain and France and made it possible for the United States of America, the first foreign government to recognise the Provisional government, to enter the war early in April fighting in an alliance of democracies against an alliance of empires. In Russia, the announcement of the Tsar&apos;s abdication was greeted with many emotions . However , revolutionaries abound and the rise of the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin (Michael Bryant) and Trotsky (Brian Cox) , slowly begin to gain an advantage . Before the year is out the Bolsheviks will be in power and the Romanovs in custody. In Siberia takes places the eventual execution of the entire family - the Czar, Czarina, four daughters and one son - in July 1918.",

Long-time pro, Irving Cummings directs this well enough, but only Miss Russell puts any oomph into her role and the visuals mainly seem concerned with her head, making sure that she has an odd looking hat or hairdo that seems to change with every scene. She wears some dynamite dresses also; credit Travis Banton for the dresses. He seems to have specialized in gowning Carole Lombard in her movies.\n\nEveryone seems to be giving it the old college try, but by now the formula had grown pretty tired, sustained only by war time movie attendance and some hope that all those Rosies out there, busy riveting together planes and battleships would be able to spend their times in silly hats once the war was over and men like Brian Aherne would be free of the restrictions of bow ties.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, let me give an honest up front detail about my review process: This film is really a 7.5 to me, but i rounded up instead of down like i usually do, because i feel this movie is trapped between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThis is NOT an action, or adventure film, at all, like most big Sci-fi. Kinda barely even a sci-fi film, I prefer to call it Speculative Fiction, but most of all its a drama, while also not being exactly what that implies. This movie isn&apos;t a &quot;Family drama&quot; but it does focus in on familial bonds, its definitely not a comedy, but it stars relatable comic actors who inject a bit of levity into the situations. Its not any of those genres But it has elements of them all. (except, to be clear, action and adventure).\n\nTo me this belongs in a genre I really love that I&apos;m calling &quot;Meta-Modern Speculative Fiction&quot;, and the easiest comparison is basically ALL the films of Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Synecdoche NY, Being John Malkovich), but others that I&apos;ve loved are: Visioneers, Donnie Darko, Southland Tales, Sorry to Bother You, The Lobster, Poor Things, Get Out, Nope and the Tv Shows Legion, The Last Man on Earth, Maniac, I am a Virgo, and Devs. I could list a ton more but im getting away from the point.\n\nAll this type of media tends to take a Speculative fiction concept, usually with some surreal mystery/thriller element, and apply those to a character drama, with a philosophical and/or psychosocial tone. They tend to defy genre convention by combining Elements of those genres and others, and an often wildly oscillating emotional undertone, conjuring disparate negative and positive associations along the way.\n\nIn this case its mostly a time travel character drama, a little mystery thriller, and a peppering of other momentary vibes. It obviously shares a lot of tropes with Groundhog day but it tackles those in a totally different way that fans of Time Travel narratives will appreciate because it compresses a lot of the classic moments with clever editing techniques that fans of film editing will also love.\n\nGive it a watch if that sounds good, and if you already but you were expecting a different movie, please don&apos;t rate it poorly because it didn&apos;t match expectation, a lot of people like me want to see movies like this, and when the weirder movies tend to get downvoted due to being misunderstood it just gets tougher to find and support films like this.",

      "reviewBody": "Germany does not have a tradition of jokes about lawyers. Any Brit or American will definitely come up with three or four jokes like\n\n\n* My father is a lawyer. - Honest? - No, the regular kind.\n\n\nBut Germans, after all, do not have a sense of humour - or do they? Watching this film, you might definitely think they do. \n\nThis film is a documentary about three lawyers, Horst Mahler, Otto Schily and Hans-Christian Stroebele, who were active in the &quot;APO&quot; movement (an opposition movement outside Germany&apos;s parliament) and who used to defend RAF terrorists like Gudrun Ensslin, Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader later on. \n\nYou see old film material and even a few scenes from old &quot;Tagesschau&quot; news about demonstrations against the Vietnam War, and how the student Benno Ohnesorg is killed during a demonstration against the Shah&apos;s visit. This all influences the three lawyers and turns them against the state with its brutal police force. But hey, this was the 1960s and 1970s. \n\nLater on, Mahler and Schily get more and more mainstream, and it is quite spooky to see Schily making speeches in parliament (and occasionally sounding a bit like Hitler) and turning more and more right-wing. So he quits the Green Party and joins the Social Democratic Party and becomes a law-and-order man when he is Minister of the Interior. Mahler&apos;s development is even eerier, because he, formerly a member of the RAF, turns into a fully-fledged (neo-) Nazi who denies the Holocaust and is therefore sent to prison. \n\nThe only lawyer who has not turned into a joke of his former self is Stroebele, who sticks to his left-wing pacifist ideals. This is probably why he is the only Green politician who is directly elected to Germany&apos;s parliament and does not get his seat because of the Green Party&apos;s percentage in the elections. \n\nI very much liked this film because it gives you a good idea of the late 1960s and 1970s in Germany - a time I am highly interested in. I can still well remember the RAF times, seeing the &quot;Wanted&quot; posters in every German post office, and I was in Heidelberg when the RAF tried to kill US Army General FJ Kroesen.\n\nFor everyone interested in Germany&apos;s post-war history, this is a must-see. I&apos;m a brainy girl, not a brawny man, and so I found this film much more thrilling than any action film on offer.",

Her grandson is very ill and in the hospital. His only chance of survival is surgery in Australia. The medical expenses will be paid by the health care system, but the transportation, etc. must be provided by the family.\n\nMaggie does not have the money, and her son has been out of work for almost a year. Maggie is determined to get the money and goes off to London in a quest of employment of any sort. She is greeted with disdain by potential employers and employment agencies as she is an unremarkable woman with no experience or talent.\n\nIn an act of final desperation, Maggie enters a sex shop on a seedy street in London advertising help wanted. It is here that Maggie finds she has a talent much sought after by the clientèle of the shop. She is given the professional name of Irina Palm by her boss, Miki.\n\nIt should be obvious that there are going to be sizable repercussions from a modest widow so radically expanding her range of experience, and there are.\n\nMarianne Faithful and Yugoslavian actor Miki Manojlovic are extremely effective as Maggie and Miki - two people who, despite their ages, are able to learn and develop from their experiences.\n\nYou&apos;ll find that Irina Palm is a very slow moving film but one that offers a very different view of human nature. It is an intriguing slice of life.",

      "reviewBody": "Those two old pros, Jack Lemmon and James Garner, in their only film together provide quite a few laughs in what would normally be a very serious subject, a constitutional crisis.\n\nTwo former presidents, Lemmon a Republican and Garner a Democrat, have a real nasty rivalry going. But when current president Dan Ackroyd tries to pin a kickback in a defense contract scandal on his fellow Republican Lemmon things get good and nasty. Garner gets into it when he starts checking on which Republican really is the crooked one and stumbles on the murdered defense contractor.\n\nAfter that when the two presidents are nearly killed when a government helicopter blows up, they are on the run. They are forced into an alliance of convenience.\n\nDespite this description, it is in fact a comedy with these two men who even as ex-Presidents are used to having everything done for them. Quite amusing indeed when they&apos;re forced out on their own.\n\nIt&apos;s funny, but there are some trenchant comments about the state of politics and life in general in America at the turn of the new millennium. Lauren Bacall is in this oh too briefly as Lemmon&apos;s wife and Dan Ackroyd is the current president with John Heard as his Dan Quayle like Vice President.\n\nRepublican or Democrat most viewers will vote thumbs up for My Fellow Americans.",

In fact, &quot;Naked Killer&quot; doesn´t bore a second, because it satisfies in all sectors: fitted with elegant pictures that could be taken from John Woo´s 1980s-gems, heavy gunfights, violent killings and some naked female flesh this film will surely delight the fans of Asian action movies - and probably not only them! The sometimes campy acting doesn´t bother, however I liked the performances of &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;-star Simon Yam, main actress Chingmy Yau as Kitty, Kelly Yao as her mistress Sister Cindy and last but not least Carrie Ng as lesbian killer chick Princess. I´d give 9 out of 10 for this great sex´n violence-comic strip from Hong Kong! Highly Recommended!!"

Perhaps the biggest surprise about the movie is that it wasn&apos;t made earlier: Anderson&apos;s audio/visual exhibitionism depends as much (if not more) on sight as it does on sound, and her recordings alone give little indication of the imagination and humor of her stage act. Employing a dazzling array of electronic effects and state-of-the-art musical instruments (for example a functioning keyboard necktie), she dances, sings, tells peculiar stories, jerks around like a marionette, and in general puts on a show that&apos;s as much fun to watch as it must have been to perform, with none of the pretensions normally associated with mass media performance art.",

When I was an adult and saw it on video, I was astonished to find that the scenes are STILL impressive and creepy!  Considering how sophisticated special effects have become since &apos;Darby O&apos;Gill&apos; was made in 1959, that&apos;s quite a tribute to the moviemaking skills of the day.  The scenery is lovely, the actors skilful and wholeheartedly into their work, the music catchy and delightful, and really there&apos;s nothing not to like in this movie.  The duels between Darby and his nemesis, King Brian, are wonderfully funny, as each tries to outsmart the other.  The village characters are all well-drawn and likeable personalities.  Pony Sugrue seems more &apos;American&apos; than the others, but then, he&apos;s not supposed really to fit in in the village, and his punishment at the end is an enjoyable comeuppance.  Favourite scenes - the banshee and death coach at the end, as mentioned, and all the leprechauns dancing under the fairy mountain then riding their little white horses out into the night as Darby plays them a wild tune on his fiddle.  Don&apos;t be put off by the date on this movie; it&apos;s as good now as the day it was made.",

      "reviewBody": "Without the aid of their buddy Jackie Chan, the icons of Hong Kong cinema demonstrates that kung fu comedy exists before and after Jackie appeared on the scene.  Magnificent Butcher is one of the many examples of great Kung Fu minus the action superstar, the story follows many strands of the Kung Fu genre with masters and schools coming against eachother, complete with climactic battles and a heavy dose of boys own humour that is the template of this succesful era of kung fu.  What makes this one of the greats is its simple charm, Yuen Woo Ping breathes so much life into this movie by treating the audience to a feast of distintly Hong Kong movie ideas.\n\n Only in Hong Kong action could their contain a scene whereby a characters uses the infamous farting technique to shame his opponent, or a blind begger mistakes a water vase being held by Samo as a toilet, and in the same movie contain an attempted rape, knives being plunged into the stomachs and the lead actor smashing his enemies head with a pray stone in extra slow-mo. Only in Hong Kong would a director attempt to gel these distinctly contrasting scenes and attempt to convey a cohesive story.  And in Magnificent Butcher we have something close to success, as Samo effectively conveys emotions of comedy and extreme outrage in the blink of an eye. What is strange is how quickly these charaters forget their injustices and gripes which eventually lead to the climactic fight sequence where everything ends in triumpth, as we the viewer dispel with the plot and relish the movies subsequent closing.  Magnificent Butcher, or Lin shi rong, is part of the era of Hong Kong movie making whereby anything that makes the audience laugh and cry for its duration was deemed a success, as the emphasis of movies made in this era was fun twinned with an element of truth, and this calloboration between Yuen Woo Ping and Samo sets the precedent for nearly everything that has been great about Hong Kong cinema ever since.\n\n Kung fu comedy at its most shameless, an undeniable  classic for fans of Hong Kong cinema."

      "reviewBody": "The first story is set in present-day Montreal and centers on a recently divorced father of two girls, Antoine Godin (Kevin Parent), who leads a successful life as a professional DJ. Despite having found true happiness in his relationship with his girlfriend Rose (Evelyne Brochu), he feels a little remorseful for having left his ex-wife Carole (Hélène Florent), for whom he still cares deeply. Antoine understands that she continues struggling to move on with her life, heartbroken. And to make the situation in which they find themselves even more difficult, their eldest daughter persistently plays their nostalgic love song with hopes of reuniting her parents.\n\nThe second story is set in Paris in 1969 and focuses on Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis), a self-sufficient, loving single mother who becomes the embodiment of perseverance and selflessness as she promises to devote herself both physically and spiritually to her son Laurent, who has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. She spends every minute of spare time with her beloved young boy with the goal to elongate his limited life expectancy. One day, when Laurent begins to be infatuated by Véronique, a new girl in his class-- who, incidentally, also has Down syndrome-- Jacqueline is struck by an overwhelming feeling as she fears that her inseparable bond with the only person she loves will be be lost with time.\n\nUp until the very end of the film, it seems like the only link between both stories is the music the characters listen to (the jazz album &quot;Café de flore&quot; appears in the second story while a certain remix is featured in the first one), but as we progress further into this mystical mystery, we learn that there is something much deeper tying together the characters and their stories of love and loss. \n\nKnowing that &quot;Café de flore&quot; would be composed of intertwined stories, I was initially a little reluctant to seeing it and very worried that its structure would collapse within the first few minutes of the film. To my pleasant surprise, this modern approach to storytelling proved to be ultimately rewarding. I believe credit is due to the film editor, who is-- believe it or not-- Jean-Marc Vallée, again. It&apos;s nice to hear that he had control of almost every visual aspect of his own work of art. With Vallée&apos;s perfectly orchestrated editing, the audience is able to follow the story without ever sensing an abrupt switch between story lines. In the film&apos;s entirety, not once did I feel that some scenes were fragmented or disjointed from others. Vallée always progresses deeper into his creation by carefully and seamlessly shifting between narratives just at the right time, creating a smooth, fluid tempo. Briefly, everything flows like a river.",

      "reviewBody": "The World According to Garp is an unconventional film, to say the least. Not so much in the sense of how it looks, or how it is acted. More than anything the film stands out because it is a human drama that doesn&apos;t take a stance or one particular point of view. T. S. Garp is simply a man trying to live his life amongst all manner of eccentric characters and unlikely situations. And like life, things happen. People grow old. There are moments of joy. There are moments of tragedy. And people die.\n\nRobin Williams plays the title character known by most as simply &quot;Garp&quot;. His mother, played with dignified enthusiasm by Glenn Close, has brought him up all by herself. She is a nurse and during WWII, she used the sperm of a dying tail gunner who she happened to be caring for in his final moments. To call this woman a feminist would be a magnificent understatement. Her sexuality is never made that clear to the viewer but is is inferred by some around her that she is in fact a lesbian. Her only relationship with a man that we learn of is the encounter that produced her son, and she spends much of the film condemning the lusty ways of men and boys. As the film goes on, she becomes a famous writer and feminist leader. Garp spends much of his life trying to be a successful writer himself and raising a family, but he never seems to escape his mother&apos;s shadow.\n\nThe plot simply follows the life of Garp and his family members. A great many things happen to these people over the span of many years. Careers are made, children are born, affairs are had, and the joys of life are often shattered by terrible tragedies. Williams is decent enough as Garp. He maybe acts a bit too zany in the light-hearted scenes, but he nails the more dramatic ones pretty well. That&apos;s the amazing thing about Robin Williams. The guy is an absolute nut most of the time he&apos;s in front of a camera, but when he bears down and plays something serious, it&apos;s stunning to see how great his range can be. He is an undervalued actor. Glenn Close steals this film though in terms of acting. She owns every scene she&apos;s in much like how her domineering character towers over that of her son&apos;s. The supporting cast is more than adequate with John Lithgow getting major props for his daring turn as a transsexual with a heart of gold. The film seems to take its share of jabs at radical feminism as it depicts a sect of women knows as the Ellen Jamsians. These women cut out their own tongues to protest the similar fate of a rape victim. And boy do these ladies HATE men. An act of violence in one of the final scenes shows how fanatical they can be. (as if cutting out their tongues wasn&apos;t bad enough!) Each person who views this film will probably see something different in it, and those are my favorite kinds of films. There are moments of definite humor, surprise, hope, and tragedy. You will not be bored. The film is based on a popular novel by John Irving and is worth 9 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

      "reviewBody": "Barquero has really no excuse for not living up to its full potential. The inspired casting choice of piting genre stalwarts Lee Van Cleef and Warren Oates in opposite sides of the river against each other and the idea behind the film  a group of ragtag cut-throats led by Oates transporting rifles and silver after a successful raid at a nearby town to the Sonoran territory in Mexico and desperately in need to cross the river before the army gets them while Lee Van Cleef as the boatman holds the barq at the other bank and refuses to pick them up. That should have been enough to keep Barquero afloat and my terrible puns at bay (ahem).\n\nWhat really keeps the film down is the unpolished, roughly sketched script. The first and closing acts sustain interest through lengthy bouts of gunfighting but some kind of semi-compelling plot needs to be assembled for the middle act where sadly Barquero fails to kick the conflict into high gear, a hard feat to accomplish with a story that seems to invite conflict and could have gone into so many different places. Instead what we get by the end of act two is the good guys outwitting the bad and saving the hostage Warren Oates was keeping tied up and Oates half mad and desperate (as the army draws closer with every passing moment) shooting holes at the water and saying to his henchman &quot;I shot the river&quot;. Not particularly endearing, don&apos;t you think? Forrest Tucker steals scenes in the role of ant-eating Mountain Phil while Van Cleef and Oates seem to be representing two different western archetypes  Van Cleef the romantic hero eclipsed by the coming modernization of the west, represented in the movie by a bunch of squatters he&apos;s called to protect, Oates the rough-hewn, murderous son of a bitch, the gritty and hardboiled aspect of the western, pioneered at the time by spaghetti westerns of whose villains he&apos;s somewhat reminiscent of.\n\nDefinitely better seventies westerns to keep the genre aficionado occupied out there but it&apos;s worth a watch for its marquee value, Van Cleef and Oates a dream match made in heaven and both in pretty good shape."

In the meantime, she visits with a religious/healing guru to deal with her bouts of nymphomania. These occur whenever she hears certain music. While the plot/story may sound intriguing, it&apos;s actually a poor production. The acting and dialogue in this feature are far inferior to the &quot;Black Emanuelle&quot; series. The sex scenes are badly photographed. Mainly, it&apos;s just a jumble of indistinguishable limbs in extreme close-up (like legs and arms) and totally unsexy. Claudine&apos;s nymphomania song  (repeated every time she has an attack) also starts grate on the senses. Finally, Ajita herself is not my idea of a sex goddess."

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a bit of a story about the sins of the father tucked away underneath Gau ngao gau&apos;s (Dog Bite Dog in English) unrelenting violence, but it&apos;s small and wisps away like fleeting warm breath on a cold day.\n\nThe movie is about a Cambodian hitman played by Edisen Chen who gets hunted across the streets of Thailand for committing a brutal murder. Unable to speak the language and having no second thoughts about killing anyone in his path (e.g., man, woman, cop or otherwise) Chen&apos;s ruthless hitman attempts to make his way back to Cambodia. The road isn&apos;t easy and a small team of dedicated cops with their own dirty past attempt to stop him, almost by any means necessary.\n\nOther reviews are right on the money that this film is absolutely nihilistic. It&apos;s shot well, but also shot to make Thailand look as filthy as possible. Large parts of the movie take place in dark alleys, landfills, and the slums.\n\nThere are no redeeming values to any of the characters save for one character who gets caught up in the middle of it, but this isn&apos;t a feel good movie and all logical conclusions would point to an ending that satisfies the movie&apos;s main themes while you&apos;re watching it.\n\nThere aren&apos;t many fantastical or too many outlandish elements about the movie. It mostly maintains a realistic pace and outcome for the encounters, but the grit, grime, and fatalistic overtones might easily put most viewers off.\n\nI would say that if you have a happy movie lined up to watch afterward, definitely give Dog Bite Dog a go. If you&apos;re feeling depressed or down or sullen or nihilistic? Well, you might want to pass on this one until it&apos;s sunny outside and the birds are chirping a chipper tune.",

      "reviewBody": "Considering this film stars Anthony Quinn, Michael Caine AND James Mason, you probably would expect even more from this movie. Well, it&apos;s not a bad film but clearly it could have been better had the script been more interesting.\n\nDespite Michael Caine being listed first in the credits, he doesn&apos;t even appear in the film until the 25th minute. And, clearly, the star is Quinn as the story really centers on him and he&apos;s in much more of the movie.\n\nThe story is set in Europe and is about Steven Ventura (Quinn) and his hatred for Brizard (Mason). It seems Brizard is a drug lord and is responsible for the deaths of one of Steve&apos;s friends in the opening scene. But even though he is a US intelligence agent working for the Justice Department, Brizard seems legally untouchable. So, in desperation he hires a hitman to take out Brizard. Coincidentally, the killer turns out to be one of Steve&apos;s old friends, John Derey (Caine). So what&apos;s next? Watch the film.\n\nThe story looks real nice thanks to its location shooting throughout France. It also has a mildly interesting plot. But what kept it from being better for me was a decided lack of energy in the film....which is amazing considering all the killing, drugs and mayhem. I think the film&apos;s pacing tended to be too slow for the material. Still, it is interesting and worth seeing....even if Mason had a very odd French-ish accent!",

A crazy comedy that I only could compare with &quot;Hellzapoppin&apos;&quot;, a Hollywood production, or some Marx Brothers films.\n\nTotally implausible situations, lived by our heroine, Mirtha Legrand, so pretty and unreal that she even plays a window store mannequin, adopting the pose and keeping quiet and... nobody noticing the deceit!!!\n\nBut there are much more outrageous situations, like her being wrapped up in a Persian carpet, tied up in it and even kicked by the thieves --they don&apos;t know a person is inside the rolled carpet. \n\nThose thieves are behind a necklace valued at one million and a half Pesos (in 1950 the value of a Dollar was 15,20 Pesos --I checked it on the Internet-- and the whole film is a continuous pursue between police and robbers to see who will get first to that necklace. \n\nAll sorts of hilarious mishaps will happen during this desperate search by pursuers on both sides of the law.\n\nMirtha Legrand was an excellent comedy actress, safe when she had to play drunkenness... One cringes and feels the embarrassment she must have felt playing that scene.\n\nThe movie must have been planned for twelve year old boys, so, if you are able to go back to that time in you life, it&apos;s a very entertaining pastime. \n\nI enjoyed it very much. \n\nAs a matter of fact I swallowed it hook, line and sinker.\n\nI will never reveal who got the necklace.",

      "reviewBody": "A Vietnam vet police helicopter pilot is asked to test a new state-of-the-art helicopter.\n\nIf you appreciate Blue Thunder for its action sequences, 80s technology and a decent hit of LA nostalgia there is no reason not to enjoy it.\n\nThe plot is a passable excuse to get Roy Schneider and Daniel Stern into the titular chopper doing all kinds of mischievous things and there is plenty of amusement to be taken from this. Imagine a couple of teenage boys let loose with hi-tech surveillance kit in a vehicle that can hover anywhere, seemingly undetected, and that&apos;s the mentality on display.\n\nMost of the characters and the dynamics between them are hugely clichéd and not really explored in much depth or with any particular interest to me.\n\nThe plot does get vaguely engaging when the main conspiracy starts to unfold. There is one foot chase sequence involving someone bound and gagged that works very well.\n\nAll the downtown LA set aerial sequences that carry the movie to its conclusion are very well made, with production values and practical effects that hold up to the modern era. The flight stunts and use of model aircraft are blended seamlessly so that virtually everything feels real, apart from the final stunt, which has been built up so much during the movie that you somehow accept it as something that has to happen.\n\nSchneider has no real acting challenges, but his presence is enough to engage anyone who is a fan of his work. Stern compliments him well in their scenes together. Warren Oates, Malcolm McDowell and supporting cast are all solid.\n\nIt&apos;s a 6.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",

The big desert vistas contrast well with the daily routines and grim duties of the characters.\n\nI think &quot;Flashpoint&quot; is in a similar class with &quot;Breakdown,&quot; where roller-coaster events keep unfolding and remain unpredictable until the very end.

Well, then there are those who live in those places that seem oh so nostalgic to us, and can&apos;t wait to get away from it all. They face the realities of rural life that so many of us day-dreamers tend not to include in our imaginings. And it also becomes hard for us to comprehend what is it about our stress-filled lives that these people want, that they would put their lives in danger and risk everything for entering another country and be part of that life. Then we realize the ignorant and arrogant lives we&apos;ve been living: The luxury of taking survival for granted. \n\nFilms like &quot;In this world&quot; show us the journey taken in search for the promised lands. And we realize that the struggle for survival is common in every part of the world; it simply takes a different shape or form. The refugee&apos;s life becomes a story of adaption, rather than reaching a resolution. The idea of getting away from it all turns into realizing the lack of the void: that the frame of mind is what dictates what we want to get away from. Because it is so easy to find something to want to get away from, anywhere we live. Winterbottom&apos;s film captures these issues in almost documented reality of two brothers in search for the promised lands. It&apos;s almost as obvious of a reality right infront of us, as real and un-noticed as the image of the main titles super-imposed on a paint-peeling wall.\n\nWe see that we all are a refugee, running away from something, only to realize that we end up chasing a dream we will be running away from again later.",

What they discover is an island where the natives still practice voodoo and have started to bring the dead back to life.\n\nThis was the first zombie movie I had ever seen. I was pretty young, we had watched it on laser disc. What this did was awaken a love for this particular kind of monster. It is an Italian film, so if the words not matching people&apos;s mouths bothers you, this is not for you. There was no CGI and special effects of this kind were really in their infancy back then, so some of them do not hold up against more modern offerings.\n\nThis is a great movie though, including the zombie versus the shark. I have never seen anything like it since.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary is about Danny Williams, a filmmaker in the mid 60&apos;s tied to Andy Warhol and the Factory. Danny vanished at that time, never to be heard from again. I was expecting a detective story, but rather it is a story told in interviews about his contribution to the Warhol legacy and, more important Warhol&apos;s relationship (a few say sexual) with Williams. Along with commentary from people who were there, such as Billy Name, Gerard Malanga, Chuck Wein and John Cale, amongst others, Danny&apos;s mom, brother and sister speak. Approximately 10 years ago or so, I watched a documentary about Factory denizen Bridget Berlin, which I thought to be a total waste of time. In this film however she is very interesting. I never heard of Danny Williams before this, but the film shows some short works he did which are almost innovative in the use of light. The title of the film suggests that Danny committed suicide, as he vanished after working on a project with Warhol and seemed to be not his usual self. You will probably like Warhol less as a person after watching this, but see it anyway. The clear eyed recollections of the people interviewed are worth the time. The director Esther Robinson is Danny Williams&apos; niece. I don&apos;t know if she actually knew her uncle but I&apos;m very happy she made this film as an homage to his talent and legacy. Its a labor of love and if you are at all interested in Warhol, the Factory or the 60&apos;s, I recommend this film fairly highly.",

      "reviewBody": "If 165 minutes seems like a long time to watch a film about a Polish bricklayer who becomes a symbol for over-achievement under the Soviet state, well, it probably is, but the film is not as dry as it might sound, and it&apos;s worth watching. Wajda adds an extra layer to the story by showing a young woman director (Krystyna Janda) using filmmaking in the 1970&apos;s as a means of uncovering the truth about what happened to this guy, and it&apos;s interesting when we see that filmmaking two decades earlier had been a means of creating his image. Just as with the communist statues and artwork from the era which show clean-cut, strong, contented workers, it was a director who came up with the idea for the bricklaying challenge in order to extol the virtues of the ideal worker under communism. Despite all this, the bricklayer (Jerzy Radziwilowicz) has an endearing innocence about him. He really wants to do a good job and to set a record, and later fights to try to find his buddy who has been imprisoned. He seems like a symbol of the Polish people of the period, and it&apos;s telling this his fate remains unknown and ambiguous for most of the film.\n\nIn poking at the so-called Stakhanovite worker, those who outperformed others but then faced resentment and backlash, Wajda deftly shows how it was all based on lies. He also shows a worker falsely imprisoned, the corruption of the state, and the soullessness of the Soviet-era construction projects (&quot;what architecture,&quot; one muses), which is pretty impressive stuff to get produced in 1977, but then again, Wajda pushed boundaries throughout his career. I loved seeing the old archival footage of the actual construction of Nowa Huta and the anti-American propaganda, and I also loved the strength of Janda&apos;s character. She&apos;s a complete badass, striking her defiant poses in bell bottoms and set to 1970&apos;s funk/disco music. Wajda&apos;s filmmaking itself is a bit workmanlike but she helps bring it to life, and as with several of his other films, this seems essential as a document of Poland over the second half of the 20th century. I probably would have rated it higher in 1977, and even now debated a higher rating.",

However he has been training another mentor Jean code name &quot;Scorpio&quot;(Alain Delon) who is just been learning the tricks of the trade as a C.I.A assasin. C.I.A boss (John Colicos) feels that Cross knows too much and that he should be killed. He soons asks Scorpio to do the job, but he refuses. Scorpio is later arrested on phony narcotics rap and is blackmailed to do the job of eliminating Cross, so he accepts it. Cross however catches on that he is being by the watched C.I.A and the game of cat and mouse between him and Scorpio begins. He later takes refuge in with on old colleague (Paul Scofield) in Venice. Yet the question remains. Who is doublecrossing who? Who will survive the game? Who is good and who is bad? This a great film. Burt Lancaster was 59 years old and he had the ability to perform his running scenes as he is being pursued by Delon and another C.I.A hitman. He is proven to be a good actor who attributed the physical-athletic attributes in the film. Alain Delon gives a marvelous performance the man forced to hunt down and kill Lancaster. I give this film 10 out of 10**********."

The Skipper hold&apos;s himself responsible for their deaths even though he was cleared of any wrong doing by a Seaman/Mariner Court.\n\nLosing his nerve and getting drunk the Skipper hangs out all day and night, for six months, at the local Califorina Club drinking instead of going back out to sea on his ship the Bella Donna. Things change for the Skipper when he&apos;s approached by a young British duet of singer and dancer Su &amp; Lou, Patsy Kensit &amp; Elizabeth Hurley. The two are dying to get out of this boring ghost town of Gibraltar and sail to sunny and swinging Barbados in the West Indies. A trip of some 2,500 miles that would take over a month. \n\nThe Skipper needing a reason to go back to sea on his ship jumps at the idea that the girls proposed to him and the next day the Skipper together with Su &amp; Lou and their pet pooch Willard sails past the &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; into the wide open and dangerous Atlantic Ocean. It turned out to be a voyage straight into hell.\n\nGreat scenic and ocean photography with a number of spectacular sunrise and sunsets can&apos;t overcome the film &quot;Kill Cruise&quot; unconvincing script and totally unbelievable surprise ending. The ending is so off-the-wall that it makes you wonder if you fell asleep while watching the film and missed something that would make it at least plausible to the movie&apos;s story.\n\nA less then glamorous Elizabeth Hurley and down in the dumps-looking Patsy Kensit make up the trio, or quintet if you include the cute little dog Willard, on the cruise yacht Bella Donna. Thing start to get edgy when Su becomes jealous of the Skipper taking her friend, and possibly lesbian lover,Lou away from her as they both have a sexual tryst right in front of her. Su plans to murder the Skipper, as well as Lou, by first letting them drown at sea as they were both swimming, and making out underwater, by taking off with the boat Bella Donna. Later Su hides the insulin that the Skipper needs for his diabetic condition and his life is saved by Lou who finds it just in time, hidden by Su inside a world globe, just before in went into insulin shock. \n\nWith the crazed jealous and murderously inclined Su on deck the movie then immediately changes course where we see the three on board with Su &amp; Lou dancing and singing as if everything that we saw up until then was forgotten about. Then were hit with an ending that&apos;s straight out of nowhere.",

The structure of the movie - alternating between the past and present, with multiple intertwining plots - keeps the viewer hooked on how the story will unfold.  It unfolds gracefully and is enjoyable throughout.\n\nThe acting is exceptional.  Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker carry the bulk of the acting load.  They are fantastic.  The relationship between these very different young women is complex and satisfying.\n\nSince the movie is about women and the female roles are so strong, this movie has been dubbed a &quot;chick flick&quot;, but that pejorative is unfair.  This is good film making and those who like plot-driven cinema will enjoy this immensely.  This one is in my DVD collection.",

The cameraman is shooting a take on what firemen go through on an ordinary day when their ordinary day turns into extraordinary. They get a call to an apartment complex and get locked inside with what appear to be zombie like creatures.\n\nIt is a movie that I would place in between the 28 days/weeks movies and Cloverfield. It has suspense (will be great on DVD w/surround sound in the future) but some of the characters lack common sense. The fact that the movie is shot from one camera had some people disappointed since it didn&apos;t involve too much of a story as to what is being &quot;quarantined&quot;, but that is to be expected.\n\nI would say that the movie could have been a heck of a lot better with a solid story and a bigger climax/plot. It is worth your time to watch, but if you don&apos;t like shaky cameras like Cloverfield and Blairwitch Project, then I wouldn&apos;t watch it.",

      "name": "Anthony  Steffen in his ordinary role as gunfighter seeks vengeance against  some Confederate traitors",
      "reviewBody": "This is an Anthony Steffen vehicle playing his usual character as revenger gunslinger as playing a phantom gone back from the grave to revenge his own death . An avenge-seeking soldier returns from the dead to take vendetta on three officers who betrayed his unit in battle during Civil War. The mysterious gunfighter without a name rides and arrives in the town to stay for execute his mission . After gunning down some desperado who tried to kill him, he set out to return to get their vengeance. Can the mysterious gunfighter without a name stop the outlaw brothers ? . This violent Western is set on eerie outdoors and dark interiors , the star is a mysterious revenger, ¨a man without name¨ , who comes to avenge against nasty villainous . It deals about a gunfighter (Anthony Steffen) arriving a little town that has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, Hardware, Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and of course the Church. The drifter will take on a couple of brothers called Murdock (Paolo Gozlino and Luciano Rossi) and their hoodlums (Carlo Gadi) , being only helped by the gorgeous Alida (Rada Rassimov) .\n\nWell crafted Western with interesting screenplay written by main actor Anthony Steffen and director Sergio Garrone . Although atmospheric , it&apos;s also downbeat and sometimes just downright nasty. The story is almost terrific and creepy as the drifter comes to strange frontier town just in time to reckoning villagers and bandits . The film is made in somewhat similar style to ¨High plains drifter(1973)¨ , it has been said that is the uncredited inspiration and also ¨Pale rider (1985)¨, both of them acted and directed by Clint Eastwood , only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from past injustices and double-crosses .\n\nThe picture is well starred by Anthony Steffen-Antonio De Teffe- , he began playing secondary roles into typical examples of popular Italian films of the late 50s as sword and sandal epics, comedies, adventures and was with spaghetti westerns that renamed achieved worldwide stardom. Anthony Steffen may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados, but in his day, from the mid-&apos;60s to the early &apos;70s, Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics . The handsome, Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz de Teffè von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there, Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre, where he found his niche. Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood, however, Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction. His acting is often accused of being wooden , but in many manners is ideally suited to playing the steely-faced gunslinger synonymous with the genre . His others successes include well liked features as Seven Dollars to Kill, The last Mohican¨, ¨Train for Durango¨, ¨Gentleman Jo¨ , ¨Four dollars for Django¨, ¨Shango¨, ¨Arizona colt¨, ¨Apocalypse Joe¨ and several others. He was still enjoyable in other genres, specially Giallos as the successful The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave¨, ¨Death in Haiti¨ or The ¨Crimes of the Black Cat¨, a good example of Giallo where he played a blind pianist - one of his roles he most liked- , and ¨Killer Fish¨ . The motion picture is interestingly directed by Sergio Garrone . Sergio started his movie career as a screenwriter and assistant director before making his solo directorial debut with the spaghetti Western ¨Se Vuoi Vivere... Spara (1968)¨. He continued to helm several other spaghetti Westerns that include ¨Three crosses of death (1968)¨, ¨Django Il Bastardo (1969)¨ his best film , ¨Quel Maledetto Giorno della resa Conti (1971)¨ and ¨Kill Django .. Kill first¨. He subsequently directed a wartime movie as ¨The dove must not fly¨ and Pornonazis and other exploitation films . Rating : Acceptable and passable.",

Reconstructing reality must be more difficult and appear less convincing the further in time from the reality exhibited you get.\n\nThis is a very good story and very intelligent plot, the actors are all superb, especially Ed Harris, here young and fresh with many great roles ahead of him, and Max von Sydow as the honest German officer. Also Horst Bucholz is doing well like all the others, and of course Eric Stoltz as the prisoner. Helmut Berger adds an appropriate portion of nastiness as a very convincing fanatical German Nazi, in some ways he makes the deepest impression in his radiance of constant extreme but well controlled menace, and Cyrielle Clair provides the necessary female bit. \n\nIn spite of the obvious artificial construction of the plot and story, it is well worth seeing and rewarding indeed for those in chase of excitement, and for those who love Paris. It is all filmed in Paris and France.",

      "reviewBody": "THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (Universal, 1923), directed by Wallace Worsley, takes an important step in cinema history. While Victor Hugo&apos;s classic novel, published in the 1830s, had been transferred to the screen on several occasions prior to this 1923 adaptation, one of mention titled THE DARLING OF Paris (Fox, 1917) featuring Theda Bara, this production ranks one of the first lavish spectacles Universal had produced thus far, as well as a truly challenging performance for Lon Chaney (1883-1930) in the role of the deformed bell-ringer named Quasimodo. Remade several times thereafter, with the most famous being the 1939 adaptation starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O&apos;Hara for RKO Radio (interestingly not by Universal!), no two versions are exactly alike. In fact, the more recent adaptation transferred to the screen became the 1996 feature length animation musicalized version, but many of the remakes then and now do owe a lot to Chaney&apos;s artistic achievement of long ago.\n\nSet in fifteenth century Paris, Quasimodo &quot;deaf, half blind&quot;, is a deformed soul attending the gathering of the Festival of Fools. Among the celebrants are Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller), a gypsy girl, &quot;a child of mystery,&quot; who enters the city of Notre Dame and dances for the crowd, and Gringoire (Raymond Hatton), a poet-playwright attempting to act out his allegorical play with little success. The crowd encounters the hideous face of Quasimodo, and instantly acclaimed him as the King of the Fools. Normally regarded a monster, Quasimodo has his moment of glory becoming the center of attention before Dom Claude (Nigel De Brullier), the saintly priest, has him return with him to the cathedral. The evil Jehan (Brandon Hurst), has one thing in mind, his lust for the gypsy girl. He sends Quasimodo to abduct her, as witnessed by Phoebus (Norman Kerry), a captain of the guards (&quot;men yielded to his sword, and women to his smile&quot;), rescuing her from the hunchback. After Quasimodo&apos;s capture and punishment through flogging, it is Esmeralda, no longer fearing him, to grant him his request for water. Jehan continues his abduction plot on Esmeralda, but because of her love for Phoebus, makes her the accused and sentenced through execution for the stabbing of Phoebus, leading Quasimodo to repay the favor by coming to Esmeralda&apos;s aide.\n\nThe other members of the cast of thousands include: Ernest Torrence (Clopin, &quot;King of the beggars, enemy of the king&quot; and Esmeralda&apos;s &quot;foster father&quot;); Tully Marshall (King Louis XI, &quot;whose dungeons are always full, whose executioners always kept busy&quot;); Kate Lester (Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier); and Gladys Brockwell (Godule, the mysterious reclusive woman who feels gypsies &quot;should all be cursed&quot;).\n\nWith Chaney&apos;s many early screen performances starting in 1914, along with hundreds of characters and thousands of faces, he actually didn&apos;t reach true star prominence until after achieving the kind of success long overdue him with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. In spite of his feature billing, grotesque makeup and sympathetic gestures, Chaney&apos;s participation in this production is actually a supporting one. Much has been written about Chaney&apos;s makeup, a misshapen face with an eye that droops almost out of its socket, mouth with jagged teeth and twisted legs, wavy hair, but it&apos;s his character behind that makeup who really brings out his sympathy and human dignity. Not essentially a horror film, but rather a love story of two misunderstood characters, the hunchback and the gypsy girl. Unlike Victor Hugo&apos;s novel, this screen version details very little about Quasimodo&apos;s background, yet, spends more time bringing out the true heritage of Esmeralda. This carefully constructed production captures the simplicity of 19th century Paris, from the authentic Notre Dame cathedral down to the costumes, making this one a true classic of the silent screen. \n\nTHE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925) remain two of Lon Chaney&apos;s most famous screen roles. During the early years of video cassette distributions, these two silent features, which have become public domain titles, were the easiest to obtain. Released through various distributors means alternate versions, ranging from bad video transfers with no musical scoring, to clear picture quality with various types of underscoring, ranging from organ to orchestral, with the majority with the average time frame from 97 to 123 minutes. Blackhawk Video&apos;s version contained a Lee Irwin orchestral score with flute sounds, ringing church bells and cathedral chanting. Republic Home Video, along Critic&apos;s Choice contained organ scores, color tints and new title cards for its opening introduction. The only debit with Republic&apos;s home video transfer is having the final scene as Quasimodo ringings the church bell of Notre Dame for the last time, abruptly ending in freeze frame as the priest (De Brulier) walks towards him, not showing what follows. The print with the abrupt conclusion was the one used in the 1971 presentation of the 13-week series of THE SILENT YEARS as hosted by Orson Welles on public television. At present, many other video and/ or DVD transfers, do feature the original opening title credits and the complete finish focusing on the bell as it slowly stops swinging back and forth before stopping with the THE END (or rather FIN) title card reaches the screen.\n\nTHE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME occasionally appears on cable television&apos;s Turner Classic Movies as part of its weekly Silent Sunday Night presentations hosted by Robert Osborne. Due to a renewed interest into the life and career of Lon Chaney, &quot;The Man of a Thousand Faces,&quot; this best known version to the Victor Hugo classic should be the one film to consider and study.

At times impressive, with an endless cast list combining Chatsworth and British talent, its main defect is the presence (hamming it up parodying The Joker) of Bluebird owner Paul Chaplin, also credited with the stupid screenplay.\n\nHis partner at Bluebird - Nicholas Steele directed. He made many classic movies for Adam &amp; Eve a decade earlier, and here we get some impressive sets, particularly a lovely fairyland setting shot in the studio. The green screen, special effects and action scenes are pretty crummy.\n\nIt boils down to one&apos;s interest in orgy scenes, an overdone feature of many Bluebird releases. For me, Chaplin&apos;s amateurish, egotistical acting ruins the show."

Anne Parillaud, an actress I&apos;ve always found fascinating, is riveting as the lead character. Jean-Huges Anglade, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno provide a very strong supporting cast.\n\nThe characters were believable and it was refreshing to see a no-nonsense approach to a murder story, meaning if someone had to be killed, they were shot quickly with no questions asked. Some of the action scenes are brutal.\n\nParillaud&apos;s character is memorable. She can change appearances, from a hard- nosed hysterical animal to a real lady. It&apos;s also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a &quot;cleaner,&quot; a role he made famous four years later in &quot;Leon: The Professional.&quot; \n\nThe DVD provides either easy-to-read subtitles or a well-done dubbed version. If sound is important to you, you&apos;ll hear better stereo with the subtitled version.",

By the time we actually get to Laurie&apos;s story, I was ready to turn it off.\n\nNot the actors&apos; faults, although who could compete with the original cast? Not the music or videography--both sufficiently atmospheric.\n\nJust a script that plods on a story that&apos;s already a classic.\n\nIn sum, this version? An average job.",

This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in the international field with particular focus on the character development of one woman who seems to have everything.  In coming to terms with the truth of her lifestyle and the high price others have paid for her comfort, she becomes a heroine who must give up almost everything she has loved and felt identified who she is.  This movie is both heartbreaking and reassuring for its audience.  I highly recommend it as a thoughtful depiction of how ignoring politics can imply inadvertently becoming an accomplice."

Dracula is in charge of the blood bank.\n\nMahowny is a fascinating character. He&apos;s a cheap slob who drives an old car. Though he loves his girlfriend (Minnie Driver), he hasn&apos;t confided in her. In fact, he lies to her, as he lies to everyone. His god is gambling -- not money, just gambling. As Frank Perlin (Maury Chaykin), one of the guys who takes his action attests, &quot;He just wants to have the money to lose.&quot; \n\nWe watch Mahowny get in deeper and deeper, creating false loans and stealing from his clients. He becomes a VIP at an Atlantic City casino where he is given the best of everything and offered even more, but he&apos;s not going to do anything that takes away from his time at the tables. Unbeknownst to him, the Feds are interested in some of his associates and become curious about this Mahowny guy, thinking he may be in on a drug racket.\n\nThis movie will keep you hooked throughout. Hoffman is brilliant and even sports a Canadian accent (the film was made there and the real Mahowny is Canadian). Hoffman comes from my home town, and as we are close to Canada, he is familiar with the accent.\n\nThe rest of the acting is uniformly good, with the standout being the remarkable John Hurt as the casino owner who wants Mahowny to keep throwing money at the casino and will do anything to keep him there. The insight into the gambling world is amazing, and may keep you away from the tables the next time you&apos;re in Vegas or Atlantic City.",
