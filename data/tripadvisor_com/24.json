See waterfalls, old-growth forests, flowering meadows, and wildlife in their natural habitat. This experience on Mount Rainier makes your expected stops — but also ventures off the beaten path, with fantastic views and vistas, waterfalls, and park grounds. Walk or don't walk, you get the option. This tour travels all the way around Mount Rainier, and the different landscapes are fantastic. Four stops for trail walks and/or waterfalls are included.  May, June and late Oct, may have snow at Paradise, roads will be clear, but may need to return same route, and we've added extra walks if this happens.",

It's great going with someone local who knows where all the restrooms and water refill stations are AND the secret picnic spot with a beautiful view of the mountain!

We had great conversation along the way (it was a long drive by the way).  She gave me lots of great ideas visiting in Seattle where we could get around with public transportation by ourselves.\n\nShe was very considerate, making multiple stops for young kids, trying to balance between fun and educational, brining a cooler so that we could get lunch on the way (restaurant at the park was not fully operating yet).  The SUV was clean and conffy.  And she is a safe driver.   She did not choose the shortest route to get to the destination, instead she took the one with more to see, and better sceneries.  I can tell Cheryl did her best to give us a good time."

She will keep you safe, teach you about the Cascade Mountain Range, and will cheer you on as you accomplish a great workout. Emily is trained in CPR and Wilderness First Aid, she has hiked all around the PNW and the world (Patagonia and Mount Kilimanjaro...), and she is passionate about conservation. \n\nIn addition to a great guide, you'll also get access to needed hiking gear! For the hike, you will get a backpack filled with the ten-essentials (key hiking safety items), comfort items, snacks, and water. \n\nAll transportation is included. \n\nAll you need to bring is your sense of adventure! A camera, sunglasses, and hiking boots are also strongly recommended. ",

The weather was not on our side but I thoroughly enjoyed our hike up to this incredibly stunning lake. Emily added all those touches to our day trip - hot drinks in the car and a full packed lunch with snacks. She also helped us identify different plant and fungi species along our route which just made this even more enjoyable. Emily also helped me celebrate my friends birthday with a little cake to celebrate which really added the final touch to our amazing day out."

Emily contacted us when we scheduled the hike to find out what our interests were. She picked us up at our hotel, with coffee and muffins, then we drove out to the hike. She also packed a nice lunch for the hike. The whole hike was tailored to our interests plus Emily has a wealth of knowledge about Seattle fauna that she shared throughout. \n\nBefore booking I read another review that said hiking with Emily immediately feels like you’re on a hike with a friend and that’s 100% true. I’d definitely recommend this hike! (In fact, I already have to some folks on the way to our next destination!) \n\nFinally, I was glad to be able to support a small local business while exploring Seattle! It’s a great way to support the local economy while learning from a Seattle native."

I came across her guide by chance on TripAdvisor and have no regrets going on a solo hike with her.\n\nEmily is meticulous about her work, and will plan a hike for you based on your preferences as well as skill level. She brought me up for a private hike up Wallace falls and as a beginner to hiking, it was the perfect setup and place to start my adventure in the Pacific Northwest. Plus, Emily is an experienced hiker so you can count on her to get all the hiking preparation needed and safety measures sorted out so that you can enjoy your hike without worry.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the direct pickup and drop-off at my hotel, as well as the breakfast and coffee that she prepared for me prior to the hike. It just goes to show how thoughtful she is with every single part of the process.\n\nWere I to return to Seattle, I'm definitely booking her again for another hiking trip, and I give her my highest recommendation to all who are reading this. Choose Emily, for she is the best guide that you can get! :)"

We also were joined by a couple too. The small group was perfect. \n\nThe scenery and places to  hike in Seattle speak for them selves and I really wanted to Experience some of it.\n\nEmily’s attention to detail was amazing!  \n*in dialogue to see what experience you have and what type of hike you would like and uses that to give you several options to chose from!\n\nI was picked up from my hotel and dropped off there too which was great and Emily was very punctual!  Herself and her mum were very engaging, polite and kind! \n\nEmily provided equipment for the hike if you wish to use it, a prepared back pack with a lunch, essentials to keep us safe!  Also had some muffins/coffee and water during the commute in the morning!\n\nThe hike was done to the pace that we wanted and felt comfortable with! We never felt rushed, Emily had so much knowledge and stories and facts about the places we were going, also shared cool places to go see in the city of Seattle. \n\nWhat I also enjoyed during this hike was the passion Emily has for the outdoors and travelling. It made for a very enjoyable chat whilst hiking.\n\nI would 100 percent recommend booking a hike in the PNW with Emily."

It was the perfect little taste of the Pacific Northwest outdoors I was hoping for.  We started really early (7am!) but it was worth it because we beat the crowds on the hike, got parking, and made it back by 2pm so I had the rest of the day to do other stuff. Her planning and attention to details paid off.  The views were gorgeous and I got lots of great pictures I will cherish.  The hike was not too strenuous but it definitely got my heart rate up.  I appreciated that Emily paid close attention to what I wanted to do on the hike and thought of every possible way to ensure I was comfortable and enjoying the experience.  Emily is a young entrepreneur who is turning her passion for the outdoors into a small business so learning this made me even happier I chose to book the hike with her.  I highly recommend you consider booking her for your next PNW excursion."

    "description": "Believe it or not, there is an old growth forest in Seattle! Let’s cruise the scenic shores of Lake Washington and learn the incredible history of how it was “re-plumbed” while on our way to Seward Park where we will have fantastic views of Mt. Rainier (if the mountain is out!). This park is an incredible gem holding one of only 2 old growth stands left in the city. The trail through the old growth is flat, less than 1 mile long and it’s ‘flip-flop accessible’. After that, lets get some locally roasted coffee and head to West Seattle to explore the beaches of Elliot Bay. This tour is mostly on foot, so wear your comfy shoes and appropriate weather gear.\n\nWith a max of 3 people, or 4 if you all know each other, this is a personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places you won't read about in most guidebooks. these are the places I take my friends and family when they come to visit, and I'd like to share them with you too. Come explore with a 30 year local!\n",

This is personable; you and some friends with the owner of the tour on a journey soaking in the hidden treasures this city has to offer. Neighborhoods? Probably the most unique you’ll ever see. A culture in communities you can’t find else where. My view on Seattle has changed and in the most spectacular way. Coffee, food, cross walks, books you name it. Now I look at the ground beneath my feet and see a whole entire history below me. From streets, to buildings, to views there’s so much more going on than just those things. I’m new to the area and I always wonder “what the heck am I going to take my friends to do when the visit?” and it’s this. If you ever have anyone tell you they want to spend the day Seattle and see what it’s like, do your friends a favor and take them on this tour. I promise it’s better than moseying through pike place and the space needle acting like you know the joint. And if you’ve been here your whole life I’ll personally bet you 5 bucks you’d learn and see something you didn’t know existed."

    "description": "On any given day in Seattle, there are experiences to be had that cannot be scheduled…\n\nMaybe its a super windy day, a rare and perfect time for visiting the Sound Garden! Perhaps the resident orcas will decide to swim in Elliott Bay, so lets go see them. Maybe Jeff B. is having a BBQ at the beach house, so let’s hop a ferry and head west for a few hours! \n\nThis tour is a dealer’s choice tour, where you allow me to host a “best of the day” adventure. You can tell me what you are interested in doing, and I’ll craft a fun outing for us.\n\nNOTE: I chose Capitol Hill as a step on the tour, but the rest of the tour could be anywhere :-)",

    "description": "A first-rate adventure in our favorite 1,100 square mile national treasure – spend time on foot in our favorite places in Olympic National Park! Our team built this tour to reconnect with natural silence in powerful landscapes; Olympic National Park is recognized as likely the quietest place remaining in North America. We’re out to pursue the tranquility that has been part of how humans have experienced the world for millennia – as we believe silence is being rapidly eradicated in our modern age.\n\nFor three refreshing days, leave behind the bustle of the city to unwind in the beauty of Olympic National Park's pristine beaches, rivers, forests, and mountains. Follow in the footsteps of Roosevelt elk and black tail deer, discover tumbling waterfalls that feed into the crystalline Hoh River, decompress under a canopy of green as moss-draped Big-Leaf Maples spread upwards overhead.\n\nThis tour is all-inclusive, we'll take care of the details.",

We did a day trip to Ranier and then three days in Olympic by booking both trips one right after the other. This worked well, felt efficient, and we did not feel crowded nor uncomfortable sharing the experience with others.  Both guides were great, food was very good, the lodging in Olympic was excellent.  Would do it this way again, highly recommend."

Each day was filled with so many different places, I really felt like I got to experience the entire area. Evan was so knowledgeable and friendly and really enhanced the trip by all the background and context he could provide for everything. You can tell he is passionate about the area and does his research. Additionally, the lodge we stayed at was very nice, and the food provided was surprisingly good. I knew the company can accommodate dietary restrictions but I wasn’t sure what the vegan options would be. Turns out they were very thoughtful and delicious. Really I can’t recommend this tour enough! Thank you Evan S and Evergreen escapes!"

Our guide Sean was amazingly knowledgeable about everything to do with the park's plants and animals and history.   The must-do is the pre-dawn chorus at the Hoh Rainforest with Matt and Sean.  To hear the rainforest as it woke to the sunrise was amazing.  Matt and Sean's insights about the park helped us to better see, hear, and appreciate nature in a new way.  A few favorites included our picnic at Lake Crescent, sun sets at the beach, the view from atop Blue Mountain, our hobo dinner, smores around the bonfire, the tree of life, and the square inch of silence.   A few surprises included Sean pulling to the side of the road and taking us to an unmarked path that led to the most beautiful waterfall; a \"sunny\" day in the rainforest, and how cheery we all could be at 3:30am.  We were not fans of the mobile chalets, we prefer flushable toilets and hot showers, but we loved ending our days relaxing around the fire, looking up at the stars, and listening to the ocean in the distance.  Sean was a great guide and took care of everything down to the smallest details including snacks on the trail, bug spray, challenging our adventurous teen-age son, and entertaining us with riddles on the drive back to the ferry.  This was our first trip with Evergreen Escapes and we would definitely use them again.   A big shout out to Sean and Matt - Thanks for a great time and we will look for more \"quiet\" places.  ---The Family from Chicago"
