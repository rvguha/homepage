The movie was so desperately trying to be real that it actually got BORING. The act is poor, the camera is awful, the script is out of control. New plot lines appear all the time leaving the previous open topics unclosed (leaving the audience to decide for itself...woah! that is something we definitely have never seen?!?) I could hardly keep myself from drifting off. I think that movies like this give a bad name to the Balkan productions on the screen. Definitely not going to see another movie form this director!",

      "reviewBody": "The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O&apos;Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer.\n\nPlot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend&apos;s disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day.\n\nIt was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and he ordered for it to be completed in under three weeks time! Film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it&apos;s a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It&apos;s easy to see even now why a mid 1930&apos;s audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture.\n\nFrom the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There&apos;s also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It&apos;s a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank.\n\nIt stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air - a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high.\n\nSmall budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10",

It&apos;s a silly movie with an absurd monster, but there&apos;s a scene around minute 40 where the heroine encounters a shark that had me quite startled. The fish appears to be 2 meters long and its open mouth comes at the camera and then at the girl in several shots. Even if she was an experienced diver, this must have been an unsettling experience. And no, it&apos;s almost certainly not an animatronic.\n\nThis was a time when the psychotechnology of horror films was developing at its fastest, so you can see how the director (clumsily) tries to manipulate our fears. Crude films often teach us more than well-made ones.\n\nAs for the music, there&apos;s a distant similarity between Brummer&apos;s music and John Williams&apos; Jaws theme, but I doubt the link is real.",

      "reviewBody": "The previous posters comments about this film say something about the reviewer. Um...Chuck Norris and David Carradine??...what kind of movie did you expect with two KNOWN martial arts stars in it? High Plains Drifter? \n\nThis movie ranks as probably one of Chuck Norris&apos; best action films of his career and was certainly the basis for his very successful series character &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. With this movie we saw Chuck change from his old image of the blonde, California boy to the dark haired, bearded, tough guy Chuck we know today. Chuck&apos;s movies took on a slightly tougher edge from this film forward (i.e. Invasion USA, Code of Silence). And who can fault the addition of &quot;grasshopper&quot; himself David Carradine to the mix? A major casting coup for the film. Carradine camps it up as a drug smuggling, karate champ who taunts and ultimately tries to kill Texas Ranger McQuade. The dialogue and action are typical of the genre and the time period but for some reason this film stands the test of time like some of the John Wayne westerns of old. Chuck clearly wished to set himself in that &quot;lone, lawman, hero&quot; mold of Wayne with this film.\n\nThere is one shot in the opening sequence where McQuade walks into frame in silhouette with the sun behind him, bearing down on his enemy that is right out of the classic westerns of the 50&apos;s. That&apos;s the money shot of the film. Robert Beltrane (of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; fame) does a nice, early career stint here as the hapless, partner who forced to tag along on McQuade&apos;s heels, but who saves the day in some small way. Much like Tyne Daly did to Clint Eastwood&apos;s Dirty Harry in &quot;The Enforcer&quot;.\n\nAnd you just can&apos;t beat the final showdown between Carradine &amp; Norris, which ranks right up there with Chuck&apos;s other famous duel with Bruce Lee. It&apos;s Action Cinema Gold.\n\nAll in all, a great little film for people who like action heroes.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;S.O.S. Coast Guard&quot; benefits from the casting of Bela Lugosi as the chief villain. He adds a certain menace that only he can provide, what with that thick Hungarian accent and his patented menacing stare.\n\nCoast Guard Lt. Terry Kent (Ralph Byrd) discovers that the evil Boroff (Lugosi) has developed a deadly disintegrating gas which he hopes to sell to a foreign power (in this case, &quot;Morovania&quot;). The key component of the gas, an element known as &quot;arnatite&quot; is being smuggled aboard the freighter &quot;Carfax&quot; to Boroff&apos;s hideout. En route the ship runs into a storm and runs aground.\n\nNews reporter Jean Norman (Maxine Doyle) and her photographer Snapper McGee (Lee Ford) recognize the fleeing Boroff. While escaping, Boroff is pursued by Terry&apos;s brother Jim (Thomas Carr) who is murdered by Boroff. Terry vows to avenge his brother.\n\nMeanwhile, in order to hide the evidence of the arnadite, Boroff sends his hulking mute henchman, Thorg (Richard Alexander) to cut the cables securing the distressed vessel. The ship then sinks. Boroff enlists scientist Rickerby (John Picorri) to manufacture the deadly gas.\n\nBoroff has Thorg dive to the sunken ship to recover the arnadite. This leads to several death defying encounters between Terry and Thorg. Eventually Boroff is able to manufacture his gas and moves to ship it. Again and again Terry thwarts his efforts. Finally Terry and the Coast Guard bring the villains to justice in the final chapter, as we knew he would.\n\nI believe that this was the first time Republic Pictures used that &quot;melting/disintegration&quot; special effect. You can see variations of this effect in several of their subsequent serials.\n\nOthers in the cast include Herbert Rawlinson as Terry&apos;s commanding officer, George Chesboro, Carleton Young and in an early serial villain role, Roy Barcroft as Boroff&apos;s henchmen.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting to note that the name &quot;Boroff&quot; is a contraction of the name BORis KarlOFF. The name of the ship, &quot;Carfax&quot; is the same as the name of the abbey Lugosi as Dracula rented (i.e. &quot;Carfax Abbey&quot;)in &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931). Coincidence? Who knows?\n\nRalph Byrd would go on to portray comic strip detective &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in three Republic serials, a role with which he would be identified for the rest of his career.",

      "reviewBody": "Unlike `The Lost Continent&apos; (1951), this 20th Century Fox Cinemascope production had an ample budget -- but the money wasn&apos;t spent very well.  A good cast (Michael Rennie, Claude Rains, Jill St. John, David Hedison, and Fernando Lamas) are all part of an expedition that discovers a plateau in South America where dinosaurs still thrive.\n\nUnfortunately producer Irwin Allen elected not to use stop motion animation to create the dinosaurs. Instead, the audience is treated to two hours of disguised iguanas and enlarged baby alligators.  Irwin Allen also co-wrote the script, which is burdened by an excess of soap opera melodrama. The good musical score, however, is by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter.\n\nTop quality production values and good photography make the film easy enough to watch, but there&apos;s a tragic story behind `The Lost World&apos;.  Willis O&apos;Brien, creator of `King Kong&apos;, spent several years during the late 1950s making preparations for a big-budget remake of his 1925 version of `The Lost World&apos;.  He made his pitch to producer Irwin Allen and the big wheels at 20th Century Fox, showing them the hundreds of preproduction drawings and paintings he had done.  He succeeded in persuading them to make the film -- but Fox refused to let O&apos;Brien do the film&apos;s special effects, substituting the poorly embellished reptiles instead.\n\nFrom all reports, O&apos;Brien&apos;s version would have been the greatest lost-land adventure movie of all time.  Irwin Allen&apos;s lack of vision is puzzling in view of the fact that in 1955 he produced `The Animal World&apos; with animated dinosaurs by Ray Harryhausen and Wills O&apos;Brien!   See my comments on `Animal World&apos; for more info."

He got a lot of help from the second director of the movie who is a much more experienced director: Ali Taner Baltaci. Ali Taner Baltaci directed movies Vizontele and Vizontele Tuuba perfectly before. Cem yılmaz was starring in Vizontele.\n\nI could say 7 up to 10. worth to see.",

      "reviewBody": "A drama queen&apos;s wet dream. It offers up a magnificent, almost epic gloss of the melodrama of at least 14 characters. The problem is that with a Robert Altman-sized cast crammed into 2 hours (Altman would take 3 or more), and screen time distributed more or less democratically, it&apos;s hard to get to know the characters--but some are very compelling anyway. The film is narrated and edited ridiculously, as if a novel had been tossed into a blender. Most scenes feel like they&apos;re less than a minute long yet are packed with dialogue. You might wonder if the filmmakers are trying to obscure script problems by making routine exposition an unusual chore.\n\nHowever, the film&apos;s melodrama is presented in a lushly dark, romantic, Gallic way. There&apos;s something heady about the experience. And the film has some extraordinary settings. The cemetery is one of the most stunning locations since Scarlet O&apos;Hara walked through the endless Confederate dead. And the train, crowded and zipping through the French countryside, is metaphoric in an undeniably physical way. Since Americans don&apos;t support public transportation, esp. trains, this experience struck me as unique."

It&apos;s been a pleasure to see it again on the European ARTE channel and to realize that it survived well the time. I enjoyed it again and not only for nostalgic reasons.\n\nAlain Delon and Lino Ventura were &apos;monstres sacres&apos; of the French cinema of the epoch. Delon was at the pick of his sex-appeal, and Ventura was always interesting enough to catch even the emotional interest of the girl in the film. They look painfully young here, but were fully achieved actors already. \n\nThe action story is quite standard, sure we have seen much better and thrilling since, but the quality of the film resides in the feeling of adventure it radiates, in the exquisite choice of many of the locations and in the sincerity and charm of the relation between the characters. There are a few more French films of the time that have a similar quality and memorable scenes of friendship which push them over the average conventional level of the commercial European cinema of the time. &apos;Adieu l&apos;ami&apos; also with Delon is another that comes now to my mind. These movies have still something to say to the cinema fans of today.",

Well over 50% of Black Sunday can be defined as a thriller and it is not until the later sections that it gets into disaster-movie-mode. As I am a fan of Bruce Dern (he deserved top billing here!) and an even bigger fan of composer John Williams - I liked the whole movie!\n\nToday&apos;s younger viewers might be turned off by some sections of the dated photography (rear projection all over the place) but to a middle aged viewer like me the photography was no problem.\n\nThe above mentioned John Williams score sounds more like a Jerry Goldsmith action score for Capricorn One (1978) or The Swarm (1978).\n\nI probably like sister film - Two-Minute Warning (1976) - just a bit more but both flicks are a knockout."

      "reviewBody": "Extremely dated a decade later, this &quot;award-winning&quot; Brad Armstrong opus has the demerits of most of his Wicked super-productions: not mere hubris but essentially forgetting what he&apos;s supposed to be doing. The talented actor/director has achieved legendary status in the Adult industry, partly due to the fawning cronyism endemic to this &quot;outlaw&quot; culture, but he wastes a lot of his time on bloated ego-tripping spectacles. I vastly prefer the craftsmanship and ingenuity of his small-scale stories.\n\nFilm, reportedly shot on 35mm rather than video, is surprisingly short, running only 83 minutes compared to the 3 or 4 hour lengths of comparable epics. It is marketed on 2 DVDs with fancy packaging like other big-budget porn in the wake of the success of Digital Playground/Adam &amp; Eve&apos;s hit &quot;Pirates&quot;, but this type of production has become as extinct as the dodo bird.\n\nThat&apos;s because audience preferences have changed drastically, and most porn consumers rent, down-load or stream an individual scene (running perhaps half an hour) and have lost interest in Adult feature films. \n\nWorse yet for Brad and this project&apos;s legacy, it is edited with flash frames and agitated clipping that works against the continuous sex representation preferred by a public only interested in getting off. Brad&apos;s artistic and sometimes intellectual pretensions are wasted and pointless.\n\n&quot;F*cK&quot; actually falls into Armstrong&apos;s occasional forays into abstract erotica, the art form perfected by &quot;Andrew Blake&quot; or whoever was using that nom de porn at the time. There&apos;s no narrative, no characterizations and no dialog, just Jessica Drake narrating pompous (no script credit either) descriptions of male and female evolution over the decades. The misogynist and even racist overtones of what Brad presents are par for the course, as in most porn this type of baiting the viewer is considered a plus -written off as &quot;naughty&quot;, iconoclastic or just part of the outlaw tradition. I found it offensive merely from a &quot;that&apos;s stupid!&quot; point of view.\n\nWith big-name cast, shooting schedule covering a two-week stretch, lavish sets and costumes, and shooting on film this commanded a far bigger budget than typical 2006 porn, especially compared to gonzo quickies which, after all, were earning plenty of money for pornographers back then. But what does Brad come up with? Six concise vignettes (each too short to be a modern-day streamer) that mainly look nice, but are boring and devoid of interest.\n\nOpener is a Conan the Barbarian clone, with Tommy Gunn sitting on his throne in slavish imitation of the iconic Schwarzenegger still that sold the original, humping two exotic breast-plated femmes: busty stripper Exotica and striking blonde Lori Lust. So confident is Brad in his craft and power of persuasion, that he quickly sabotages all the time and effort that went into styling and costuming by having Tommy wearing a rubber - the safe-sex Wicked policy of using condoms adhered to throughout the film, despite its inappropriateness to the fantasy scenes depicted. Statistically, the % of video titles released in 2006 featuring condoms would likely be less than 1%.\n\nIce La Fox is an interesting choice to portray the goddess Kali in the next vignette, giving blow jobs and hand jobs with her other arms portrayed by &quot;helping hands&quot; Jeneveve Jolie and Wicked contract star Carmen Hart.\n\nHart returns as part of an ensemble portraying a misogynistic dinner party in which she and other beauties (contract star Kirsten Price, Katsumi and all-time fave Mia Smiles) are carried down the staircase literally on platters to be &quot;served&quot; to the assembled gentlemen. This dumb orgy is carefully choreographed by Brad, right down to Mia getting her facials and drinking spunk from a goblet where one of the studs has deposited it. Most striking element is merely Mia having big breasts a decade after her initial stardom (and the way I remember her, still fresh and unscathed by the porno wars). \n\nBrad plays the race card for punning reasons in a silly segment presaging today&apos;s IR craze. The bosomy and under-appreciated Trina Michaels guest stars as a dominant modern woman, on her bed heavily bejeweled with her furs and two Dobermans. Brad has the two fierce black dogs morph into Black porn stars Sean Michaels and Mr. Marcus to hump Trina, condoms flying. Michaels gives Michaels some long-dicking in her posterior, yet no d.p. is delivered by the stingy auteur, just requisite facials.\n\nJessica Drake stars in the remaining two segments: first in a four-girl daisy-chain of babes bedecked in Lady Pompadour hairdos and outfits supposedly portraying living dolls. This exercise emphasizes anal sex as well, with dildos and even a dildo-achieved d.p., and is clumsily staged so as to feature all-time Sapphic great Felecia (her name misspelled consistently in on-screen credits) but render her unrecognizable.\n\nFinale is likely the most successful segment, titled &quot;Android&quot;, but originally called &quot;Robot&quot; on the clapperboard shown in the &quot;Making of&quot; featurette. (That plus bonus filler is on Disk 2 of the set, when in fact all the footage would have easily fit without any compression on a single disk). Eric Masterson with his platinum blond haircut is the scientist who creates her as a perfect woman, and then indulges in typical fetish-genre (see: Tanya Hyde or Dana Vespoli videos) medical instruments porn, in which a speculum shows us the inside of superstar Drake&apos;s pussy and when she&apos;s not fitted with a bejeweled butt-plug has Eric reaming her with a metal dildo. That&apos;s entertainment!"

Yes, everybody knows this movies is not hilarious but that&apos;s not its goal, it&apos;s a movie about how Simon Pegg&apos;s character tries to overcome his fears. I found it funny from time to time but mostly I loved Pegg&apos;s acting and most of all I loved the direction. The animated part at the end of the movie is awesome, that alone makes the movie worth watching",

The visuals were absolutely stunning, especially the scenes of the brumbies galloping freely.\n\nThe basic premise of the story about the Man&apos;s obsession for the Silver Brumby was excellent.  The medium of the mother relating the story to her daughter was also handled well, but some of the other scenes with the mother and daughter distracted from the flow of the film. Especially the scenes with the kangaroo.  To me they seemed disjointed as if they were just thrown in hodgepodge.\n\nOverall I loved the movie and will watch it again for the Australian scenery and horse scenes.",

The pair and their three kids (not-real life) are up against a villain who really doesn&apos;t like noise. The sound design is some of the best in recent time. The sound and sometimes (often) lack there of make this movie. Krasinski shoots to precision with a pretty good story to match. Are there a few inconsistencies? Yes, but there is never a time this movie lost my attention. Your nerve will be challenged and your skin may crawl, but don&apos;t let that stop you from watching this riveting feature.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m absolutely amazed at the awful reviews people have given this film. I thought it was great!! Ok, I did have the advantage of seeing it on tv last night just after Van Damme&apos;s DREADFUL &quot;A.W.O.L&quot; but i still reckon Rocky 5 is a gem of a movie. Forget his voice (which CAN be irritating at times), Sylvester Stallone has the sharpest mind in Hollywood and he&apos;s highly accomplished in every field of movie-making. Boxers are the roughest and toughest of people but they&apos;re still human with the same feelings and vulnerabilities as everyone else &amp; I think Stallone deserves MEGA respect for the compassion and understanding which shines through all 5 of the Rocky series. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s an emotion or a situation a boxer could face that Sly hasn&apos;t covered - and covered convincingly. The problem this film has always faced is that it appeals to a different, more thoughtful audience than the first 4. It&apos;s much more of a &apos;drama&apos; than an &apos;action&apos; movie. Take it as it is, and dramas don&apos;t come much better. The &apos;sugary&apos; scenes between Rocky &amp; his son are always particularly savaged in listings magazines. But what do they know! I found them genuinely touching. Here&apos;s a guy with a limited intellect desperately trying to reach out to his son and not really knowing how to express himself. Stallone CAN act! Talia Shire was electrifying &amp; Richard Gant deliciously horrible as the thinly disguised Don King. &quot;Touch me &amp; I&apos;ll sue!&quot; I remember seeing Rocky 4 at the cinema in 1986. At the time it seemed wonderful, but, all these years later the &quot;isn&apos;t America wonderful&quot; theme has aged badly and the flag-draped ending is just embarrassing. Rocky 5 hasn&apos;t aged a bit and remember Stallone was FORTY FOUR when 5 was made. He looked pretty damn good. The fight sequence near the end is as good as anything in the first 4. Yes! People were standing up in the theatre and yelling, every bit as much as a real fight, and this wasn&apos;t even &quot;in the ring&quot;. I always remember the muffled roar of the audience when Stallone looks to camera just for a couple of seconds and we all knew Tommy Gunn was finally going to get his arse kicked. Sheer entertainment. I&apos;ve heard Stallone is fond of saying to newcomers: &quot;Forget the art. It&apos;s a business.&quot;  Maybe it&apos;s because he thinks like that, that he produces such wonderful art. For me, Rocky 5 has to be 8 out of 10."

The story of how a journalist claws his way to the top while bedding a whole row of society ladies might, one would have thought, have struck a resonance with Goebbels, who as film minister had the opportunity to ban it if he wished - but apparently he wasn&apos;t blessed with sufficient self-consciousness to recognise the implied dig. Even if its contemporary satirical intent is perhaps overstated, the film is a real pleasure to watch - most notably for poor Lizzi Waldmueller, who was killed by shellfire towards the end of World War Two and who here sings the film&apos;s catchy theme &apos;You have luck with the girls, Bel Ami&apos; surrounded by a bevy of cartwheeling can-can dancers. Good too (as always) is Hilde Hildebrandt as one of Duroy&apos;s society lovers."

I unequivocally recommend &quot;American Pimp&quot; to those select few &quot;squares&quot; who seek to broaden their knowledge of &quot;the game&quot;. It should also be required viewing for all &quot;players&quot; or erstwhile &quot;macks&quot;. Quite often, documentaries inevitably reveal the filmmaker&apos;s personal views, at which point the myth of objectivity dissolves. Not so with the Hughes brothers dissection of pimpology. Most if not all myths surrounding these gentlemen of leisure are exploded within the flick&apos;s first few frames. It doesn&apos;t matter how much the Hughes brothers show you- it&apos;s obvious they&apos;ve just scratched the surface. If the pimp game was Disney World, all of us squares would be snapping Polaroids on a tourbus rolling past the parking lot. And there is an ironic symmetry in the knowledge that both square and pimp are outsiders to each other&apos;s worlds, overlapping through hoes, cash, and the law. Pleasure is the business of a gentleman of leisure, and a suitcase full of classic tunes on the soundtrack smoothly transports one into the life of  &quot;yac&quot; and custom-fitted suits. But for all the glory, there is also exile and regret. The inclusion of archival film and television footage is strategic and precise, lending an historical perspective to the Pimp of the Now. Wake up and smell the cologne. Pimpin&apos; ain&apos;t no joke."

Of course the thugs are pretty smart, and will catch on pretty fast. The story is okay. Did the u s border patrol really have the budget for fighter planes, with mounted guns in 1937? Maybe. It&apos;s all fun, silly, and pretty simple. Directed by charles coleman. He worked on some HUGE films, but always as second unit. This is the first film i had seen that he directed himself. Charles quigley died pretty young at 58. And this appears to be the first film where rita cansino was credited as rita hayworth. At 19, with columbia pictures.",

You see some of the city sights and also the famous Jewish cemetery but not in a tourist fashion, it all serves the romantic atmosphere of the movie: romantic in the fashion of Hoffmann and the German doppelgänger idea. Paul Wegener is far away from a modern day movie star, but he was one of the top German theater actors of the days. He fully embraced the concept of movies and even directed some. The author Hanns Heinz Ewers produced some dangerous Nazi books later on, but this one is a major achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a semi-guilty pleasure. In some ways it retains the sheen and talents at the waning days of the big studio machine, and that&apos;s a plus. It&apos;s soapy, melodramatic and over-the-top, which is certainly entertaining if you don&apos;t look for Art with a capital A. And there is a visual lushness in the cinematography not to mention the emphasis on physical lushness, eg Troy Donahue and Diane McBain, and some of the other characters, all dressed to the nines in suits, ties, contrasting sharp vests, crinolined party dresses, preppy red v-neck sweaters backdropped against a blue sky on an impossibly handsome blond Adonis. I can&apos;t even say anymore if Troy Donahue is a good actor. I just like watching and listening to him, and I think he does have a certain conviction- his earnestness - which lends authenticity to his performances. Others call him wooden. I think he&apos;s more than good, and under-rated. (And my eyes can&apos;t get enough of his physical beauty.) Then there&apos;s Diane McBain, who I scantly know but is right up there with Donahue - breathtakingly beautiful. Claudette is okay, but the part itself is anachronistic and annoying - a bit long-suffering and stoic, as her parts often are - in a role that demands she ignore a cruel, brutish, crass man she marries. And rounding out the pluses, I love Max Steiner&apos;s lush, anachronistic score. The negatives do abound: the script is a bit shrill and melodramatic, which you expect of soap operas of that period. I can&apos;t decide if Karl Malden is dynamic or excessive, though he&apos;s always effective. Connie Steven was never my perky cup of tea. Dean Jagger caught my attention as a gentle father-figure, and touched me deeply. Ultimately, my feelings are colored by the bias of nostalgia. I very young when it was released, and have some residual nostalgia for what I remember and miss from that era. Someone twenty years old would find it mostly silly, I think.",

Miss Ming character also gives us some nice touches of craziness.\n\nBesides the comic situations, there is a more serious tone. The movie shows us the rigidity of the retirement system, from which a number of people are excluded, as they are anyway excluded from the whole economical system. A few moments in the movie also make us feel how getting old can be a wrecking for these people.\n\nSo there is both fun and sensibility there, and Gérard Depardieu is good at conveying both. This is his best role for a great while and it proves that he stills has something to give.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is often good and funny, but sometimes &apos;s not focused enough. The story tries to cover a lot of themes, genres, and plot implications which doesn&apos;t always work. The best parts are the ones which deal with Charlie/Irene complicated relationship, in which you never know for sure if she&apos;s manipulating him from the beginning or not. One funny thing was the homage to Mafia movies, such as The Godfather. Some lines really hit their targets, too (Well, it&apos;s not many if you consider the size of the population, comes to mind).\n\nThe acting is very good, and the best thing of the movie. Jack Nicholson plays an incredibly dumb character, that gets wonderfully developed by the end. He has a great comic timing. Kathleen Turner is very good, she has a great chemistry with Jack, and can look innocent and the moment after a total bitch. Besides, she ha a great, calm, sure delivery. Anjelica Huston is very funny playing mean / jealous / spoiled / manipulative/sweet, though lack of screen time hurts. The supporting are all great, and the one who plays the Don is hilarious, with his sadistic way of saying his lines.\n\nThe direction is simple, but has some original shots, it works with this material. It&apos;s mostly steady camera. The music creates a contrast; it&apos;s quite cheery and happy, and that makes the movie funnier. It&apos;s a very dark comedy in my opinion, and sometimes a romance drama. It&apos;s worth watching, and original, but not a masterpiece. 7.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "The title of this film is appropriate and describes well what the outcome of the conflict will be. Gerard Depardieu, working with co-director Frederic Auburtin, take us back to a not too distant past to an easier time. The flavor of the film is typically French.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to see why Mina, the ravishing looking young woman at the center of the story, seems bored with her present situation. She has married a man that is, in some ways, a loser, to her eyes. Georges doesn&apos;t seem to share the same interests Mina, especially for the movies. Georges, an unemployed man, prefers to spend his time at the local pub, playing cards and drinking. As a couple, one wonders what has kept them together so long. She is a beautiful woman and it&apos;s hard to see what attracted her to Georges.\n\nMina, on the other hand, jumps at the offer she gets from Claire, a wealthy woman in her town, who offers her a job as a housekeeper. When she meets Matthias, Mina loses all inhibitions and becomes involved with this man that is the opposite of her husband. Tommy, the son, plays a significant part in the affair. Mina has involved him from the start; this young man, instead of being horrified by what his mother is doing, shows a perverse side when he goes along in keeping his mother&apos; secret.\n\nThe last scene of the film offers a poignant reflection on the movie in that Mina and Georges&apos; separation is permanent, as their lives have taken them in different directions.\n\nCarole Bouquet is a gorgeous woman. By pairing her opposite Gerard Depardieu, the contrast is even more evident. Despite of the costumes she is made to wear, one can see in her Mina an elegance that tells us she does not belong in this marriage, or this town. Mr. Depardieu&apos;s Georges is a man that reacts with resignation to the break up. By being philosophical, after trying to reason with Mina, he conveys to us that he knew this would come as their relationship went nowhere.\n\nCharles Berling, is seen as Matthias, an engineer who is in charge of the construction of the bridge. He is a married man, who will probably will end the affair and go back to his wife, as most of these romances have a certain time span. Stanislas Crevillen, plays young Tommy. This boy shows a cruel side toward his father, although nothing seems to be wrong in their relationship.\n\nThis film has elicited some negative comments in this forum, but in spite of that reaction, the movie will be appreciated for the frankness in which these people tell one another where they stand and for not beating around the bush in denying or hiding the truth. Adultery, after all, is a fact of life that shows its ugly face in all types of society.",

      "reviewBody": "In post-war Vienna, four sergeants, each from a different occupying power, share a jeep patrolling the International Sector at the heart of the old city. They get along pretty well -- American Ralph Meeker and Russian Yossi Yadin had actually met during the War -- but when Viennese Viveca Lindfors enters their view, matters become confused. She is waiting for her husband, Hans Putz, to be released from internment camp in Hungary. Word comes he will be in the next batch, but he fails to show up; he escaped just days earlier. It&apos;s obvious he&apos;s making his way to Vienna and his wife. Meeker, the French sergeant, and the British one are pretty easy-going about the situation, but Yadin has orders to capture him.\n\nIt&apos;s a well written, shot, and acted drama about the attitudes of the non-coms; even as the tension surrounding the Berlin Air-Lift roils international relations, Vienna is a city in which the occupying powers are still cooperating. Unfortunately, the last half hour is shot at night-time, and the print I looked at was pretty dark, so it&apos;s sometimes hard to tell what&apos;s going on during the pursuit of Putz. Still, there are plenty of good moments here, and it was time well spent watching this.",

Sooo many TV shows and movies have been filmed there. They frame the shots so that the Hollywood sign doesn&apos;t show in the background. It&apos;s always cool / nostalgic / comforting to see in movies.\n\nBut I digress -- this sequel actually isn&apos;t that bad. The first one is terrible, but this one is only marginally dumb. Yes it&apos;s bad, but not as bad (or annoying) as the first one.\n\nMichael Gross from Family Ties is in it! And a young, cute Hilary Swank. The bad guy&apos;s name is Bojesse -- if you can name another dude who has that name I&apos;ll give ya a nickel.",

It had the usual twists and turns or Asian horror and great moments of suspense. For the first time in years i actually jumped out of my skin at one point, and not in the cliché American horror way, this film is really smart, and well made. I was almost in tears at a few points because the storyline has some really sad parts; but any horror that triggers emotion, except for just fear, always makes it a better film in my opinion.\n\nI think it is definitely worth watching if you get the chance to, its probably the best horror i&apos;ve seen in a while.",

The irasible Storekeeper who Will works for pretty well sums up the local attitude after the Newspaper man Kingsley sent arrives &quot; Where&apos;s the box? &quot; He asks, assuming young Stoneman has died in the course of the race. &quot; Don&apos;t You get the Newspapers here ? &quot; the shocked reporter responses and passes him several.\n\nI enjoyed Mackenzie Astin&apos;s performance, but it didn&apos;t surprise me, He&apos;s Sean&apos;s brother and the son of John Astin and Patty Duke who both did a fair bit of acting. David Ogden Stiers&apos; character was almost strictly Charles Winchester. I also liked Kevin Spacey&apos;s reporter out for the &quot;big story&quot; who in a sense was the biggest underdog of all... Imagine getting to page One in the midst of a World War from the K 9 section. uplifting , though not too believable. There&apos;s also that scene where wealthy gambler Angus McTeague visits Will in the dog shed and offers him 3000 dollars to drop out of the race. The Boy is sorely tempted and after He leaves, lead dog Gus gives him a almost disgusted look and Will says &quot; I didn&apos;t take it... did I ?&quot; No. young Stoneman is not cowed by anyone or anything but Gus the dog and is not all that nice... just human. Could it really happen ? doubtful, but then it is Disney.",

She reminded me of all the spoiled, obnoxious girls you avoided like the plague in college. So what&apos;s left? Fine performances, well, more like cameos really, by LaPaglia, Hannah and Thomas and Julie Christie does a strange turn as a Jewish mother. Yes, that&apos;s right.

      "reviewBody": "LA TRATTA DELLE BIANCHE (WHITE SLAVE TRADE) is a sensationalized and semi-tawdry melodrama about a prostitution ring. The women in the cast are a who&apos;s-who? of sexy Italian actresses of the period: Eleonora Rossi-Drago, Silvana Pampanini, Tamara Lees, and Sophia Loren (Sofia Lazzaro). Marc Lawrence plays white-slaver Marquedi, a kind of two-bit Jimmy Cagney from American 30&apos;s gangster films, a genre which this movie attempts to emulate. He recruits trade by sponsoring marathon dance contests. Rival gang warfare over prostitutes, with the girls stuck in the middle of the fray, forms the nucleus of the film. Vittorio Gassman is Michele, a sleazy hanger-on for the vice syndicate. He and Lawrence both vie for Silvana Pampanini&apos;s affections. It&apos;s a film that is quite watchable and entertaining but which contains very little depth. There are several very lurid episodes including the brutal beating of Eleonora Rossi-Drago. In both Britain and the U.S. the picture was cut by 30 minutes to a 67 minute running time, atrociously dubbed, retitled to GIRLS MARKED DANGER and dumped in the U.S. by distributor I.F.E. into the grind houses and drive-ins. It was not reviewed by any of the major newspapers although Variety documents it twice. Its director, Luigi Comencini, has made quite a few good films in his career including the legendary BREAD LOVE AND DREAMS and BREAD LOVE AND JEALOUSY (FRISKY) with Gina Lollobrigida, the Italian &quot;Boys&apos; Town&quot; film PROIBITO RUBARE, and an excellent adaptation of Elsa Morante&apos;s novel LA STORIA. This must qualify as an interesting guilty pleasure and although it is a distinctly lesser effort of his, it bears reviving and re-evaluating just to see this cast of actresses together in one film."

Only one that I didn&apos;t love is Parash Pathar.\n\nSatyajit Ray is my favorite filmmaker and all of his movies are master pieces. It is hard to find a fault in any of his movies. Acting is always very good, yet subtle. Background score is never over the top. There is no cheap melodrama and the viewer is encouraged to make his own conclusions. Even a minor actor not acting up to par has a jarring effect. It is like watching a blemish on an extraordinary piece of art.\n\nSo I was quite surprised by this movie, as the lead character Paresh Chandra Dutt was overacting a lot. So were some other actors. While in almost all Ray&apos;s movies characters are very real here they are caricatures instead and there is no subtlety to be found. Also the story never took an unexpected turn, it is another morality tale centered around philosopher&apos;s&apos;s stone. Though you can find Ray&apos;s touches here and there, there are not enough of them to save the film.\n\nThough it a good film when compared with other Indian films of the same period, it doesn&apos;t in any way compares with Ray&apos;s other movies. I would recommend it only to Ray&apos;s die hard fans like me. Though I didn&apos;t really liked the movie I didn&apos;t consider it a waste of time either.",

And, apparently well spoken in many different languages, including her well regarded French, and English, and I presume other languages not known to me at present.\n\nShe said something profound earlier in the film; if I paraphrase, it was something along the lines of, &quot;dreams are better if they are not fulfilled.&quot; Ironically, this was the case in the unusual circumstance the characters found themselves in in this film: Szilvia, needed a surrogate, to bear a child (since she was infertile), to obtain her inheritance from her soon to be departed father. Enter, Irene (Isabelle Huppert), a Jewish girl to satsify her request... BUT, as soon as the &quot;baby&quot; entered the equation, this so called dream; this so called convenience to obtain Szilvia&apos;s rich father&apos;s estate, became incredibly complicated. As you would expect, emotions are rarely left aside. Especially when a baby, and a wandering husband; and an elegant Irene are standing across from you. Who wouldn&apos;t be intimidated by that? Perhaps it would have been better if this wasn&apos;t actualised... The plan sounded too good to be true; where one can only dream of it, and nothing more. Who knows?\n\nThen we have the looming Holocaust ever present in the background. Along with this film being incredibly interesting, it did serve me well to empathise with what it may have been like at that time and place. Anyway.",

Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in McDonalds.\n\nHitler isn&apos;t mentioned by name, since America wasn&apos;t at war at the time they was filmed, but it&apos;s pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!\n\nThere seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black &amp; white films of the 1930&apos;s and &apos;40&apos;s. Blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along. And then there is the type we know from later films like &apos;The Night of the Living Dead&apos; and &apos;The Evil Dead.&apos; Still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in various movies over the years. \n\n&apos;Revenge&apos; features the former zombie type, although, these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens. One black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair, looks like a young Don King.\n\nAs to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that&apos;s where he makes his mistake. Even though he lets her keep her strappy heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead, she&apos;s not happy about it.\n\nIt all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the tale must be, never, ever, turn your wife into a zombie, it&apos;s just asking for trouble....\n\nThe film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish, but never rises above it&apos;s poverty row origins. Not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; came out in 1976, the summer that I started playing little league. I know I am not breaking any new ground when I say that this film is a classic, but hopefully I can educate some of the younger viewers and posters as to how realistic this film is, in some ways.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that anyone who has ever played organized youth sports has had a Tanner Boyle, Timmy Lupus and a Kelly Leek on their teams. This is just how it is, and for better or worse, it is one of the galvanizing factors that make youth leagues etch themselves indelibly into the memories of all those who have participated in them.\n\nSecond of all, kids curse. I don&apos;t know who the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; out there are, but they should look back into their own memories and try to figure out just when they learned to use the F-word. If you didn&apos;t learn it from your parents, you learned it from other kids. Granted, not all of us knew exactly what the words meant at that age, but we still used them. It was a small measure of rebellion at the age of seven.\n\nWhen Tanner Boyle makes the comment that the team is filled with &quot;niggers, spics, Jews and now a broad,&quot; it would be a crass, hateful comment if it had come from an adult. Yet, as a youth, Tanner gets a laugh because we all know that he doesn&apos;t really mean it, he is just repeating what he has heard at home -- not to condone what might have been said over the Boyle dinner table. The proof of this is obvious when Tanner &quot;takes on the seventh grade,&quot; and makes a valiant attempt to preserve Timmy Lupus&apos; honor before he gets thrown into a garbage can. Regardless of Tanner&apos;s racist remarks about the team, and his shunning of Lupus, &quot;Lupus, why don&apos;t you sit over there? (abbr.)&quot; he is willing to fight for those same people.\n\nThird, (sorry for the digression), that&apos;s what parents are like. It is a truth that goes down through the ages: when it comes to their children, all adults are a-holes. When it comes time to see their children strive to excel at something, they become the obnoxious, bullying, chest-beating sh**s they have warned their children not to be. For the most part it is an extension to the children for what the parents&apos; couldn&apos;t be in the first place, e.g. a good shortstop.\n\nAnd Fourth: Losing. There is something about those pinstripes and even the moniker &quot;Yankees&quot; that make some of us want to do violent things to a couch. Mind you, I am not a native southerner, nor am I a Red Sox fan. I am just a man who can see the fact that pinstripes and the word &quot;Yankees&quot; symbolizes a corporate juggernaut that tries to annihilate the concept of fair play. For the Bears to ultilmately lose to the &quot;Yankees&quot; is just. They got beat. Perhaps it is an irony that this movie came out one year after the last choppers left Saigon, that defeat was in the air, so to speak. \n\nThere was still a message to this movie. A message that I have carried throughout my adult life. A message that Churchill had during the Blitz, and Giuliani had in the post 9/11 rubble. Once again, a line from Tanner Boyle: &quot;Hey Yankees, you can take your trophy and shove it up your ass. Just wait until next year!&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Strange Cargo&quot; is a 1940 film starring Joan Crawford and Clark Gable that leaves the usual story lines behind - romantic comedy, kept woman, rags to riches - as it weaves an allegorical tale of escaping prisoners and a Christ-like figure who accompanies them. Gable is Andre Verne, a prisoner on Devil&apos;s Island who escapes with several other prisoners (Paul Lukas, Albert Dekker, Eduardo Ciannelli, J. Edward Bromberg and John Arledge). During the evening count, he&apos;s almost found missing but another man, Cambreau (Ian Hunter) replaces him in line. He then boards the boat to the mainland with them and Julie (Crawford), probably a prostitute, who is escaping also from a lecherous bounty hunter (Peter Lorre).\n\nThe prisoners fall on hard times as they escape through the woods and also while at sea when their water becomes tainted. Cambreau gives each prisoner comfort and helps them to confront the evil that brought them to Devil&apos;s Island, helping to bring them peace at last. This is not lost on Julie who sees a chance for redemption. Verne, however, isn&apos;t interested.\n\nThis is a very simple story beautifully directed by Borzage. The atmosphere of the film is dark and haunting. There is no preachiness. The sheer power of Cambreau and his sense of faith is what brings the prisoners solace. Hunter is majestic in the role. Gable is appropriately tough, and Crawford brings depth to Julie, who thought she knew what she wanted. The rest of the cast is top-notch.\n\n&quot;Strange Cargo&quot; seems like a film that was made in the early &apos;30s with its Christian parable. This was the last film that Crawford and Gable made together. Its powerful message makes this a fitting ending for a fine MGM team.",

It&apos;s honestly worth watching this movie just for the opening scene alone which is just incredibly well done in all aspects and portrays some of the horrors that the soviet troops would have witnessed when arriving there.\n\nOverall this is a highly entertaining war movie, fantastic CGI for the time, everything is well shot, the set pieces are gorgeous and even the acting and characters are well done.\n\nAll that said this is of course a Hollywood production, don&apos;t expect much in the way of historical accuracy and definitely expect a silly love story (though not the worst) and everyone speaking English with poor Russian and German accents.",

      "reviewBody": "Last night I saw &quot;The Lover&quot; on video. I couldn&apos;t speak or move for a few moments after the final credits.  I just sat there, half staring, half crying.\n\nA poor French teenager from a dysfunctional family is leaning over the railing on a barge sweating through southeast Asia.  A meticulously groomed Chinese man in a three piece white suit is staring at her, telegraphing that if this isn&apos;t, for him, love at first sight, it is at least his obsession for the next two hours of film time. He, gingerly, aflutter in a stereotypically feminine way, approaches. She is blase, rock hard.  He offers her a ride.  In the back of his chauffered limousine, they sit in opposite corners.  While he is looking out the window, inch by inch, his hand moves toward hers. With contact, she looks even more bored, even more blase. By the time he gets her to her school, her head is thrown back, and his hand is in her lap.\n\nThe actress playing the teenager looks, in various shots, to be anywhere from a naive and buglike fifteen to a jaded twenty three. Since much of the rest of hte movie is devoted to full body nudity and graphic scenes of sexual intercourse, her youth, both as an actress and as a character, was an issue when the film was first released. I didn&apos;t see it for that reason.  I was convinced it was exploitation of men&apos;s fantasies of making it with a child.\n\nBut the film didn&apos;t feel that way to me at all.  To me, it seemed to capture really well the un self conscious power and ammoral curiosity a teenage girl experiencing her sexuality for the first time can experience.  I was grateful for that.  I&apos;ve never seen anything else like it on film.  It&apos;s so rare that a woman is allowed to f*** and not fall in love, to retain a curious, animal look even during orgasm.\n\nThe sex scenes talked to me.  They communicated as much as the scant dialogue the personalites, desires, strengths, weaknesses, of the characters.\n\nThis would have been a very different movie -- a much shorter and grimmer one -- had the man, the &quot;Lover&quot; of the title, been anything other than what he was.  He was not a rapacious, exploitative beast. He was, rather, a romantic.  Confused, worshipful, easily hurt. Chinese in a time and place when being Chinese made him less than she in some way, in spite of his relative wealth and her poverty. Vulnerable, because he was so in thrall to her, and she was merely curious about him, and hungry for physical pleasure.\n\nMany scenes in the movie spoke to me loudly about race, power, sick family systems, money, sex.  I don&apos;t want to describe them for fear of spoiling this movie for anyone else.  But I&apos;ll mention -- the scene where he takes her ratty family out to dinner, their disdain for his race, his effort to not reveal that he is insulted, and how he deals with his pain once he gets her alone.  His wedding.  Her waiting for him;  his never coming.  Her resonse to the pianist playing Chopin on the ocean liner.\n\n&quot;The Lover&quot; -- thumbs up."

But what he has here is true; sophisticated, intricate and rewarding. Viewing is definitely recommended.\n\nThree boys, Dave (Tim Robbins) Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) are reunited after the murder of Jimmy&apos;s nineteen year-old daughter. Immediately, a whodunit case arrives. Sounds average, dunnit?...\n\nNo. It&apos;s much more than average. What might appear as a normal murder mystery is more. The acting, particularly from Robbins and Penn, is immaculate. Robbins is still recovering from child sexual abuse along time ago. Penn, so realistically and amazingly, mourns over the loss of his daughter. Laurence Fishburne (playing cop Whitey) is as smart talking as ever, whilst Kevin Bacon gives a solid performance as the homicide cop investigating the case.\n\nThough the film becomes a bit uneven towards the end, this tough, brutal and uncompromising; but still, a masterpiece, and the best work Eastwood as done in years.\n\nFinal Analysis: 9 out of 10",

But I still didn&apos;t watch it although after I&apos;d seen Kenneth Branagh&apos;s Belfast (2021) then I thought surely I was brave enough to watch this. Of course it turns out that it is not at all terrible or harrowing and it becomes to be more like a romance. There is still some killing and fighting and burning but nothing like as it could have been. It begins well but becomes just a bit silly towards the end. I also thought that Helen Mirren was fine but no idea how she had an award at Cannes. She had been fantastic in The Long Good Friday (1980) and also Hussy the same year and even rather brave with Caligula (1979). I guess that it was difficult doing, The Cook, the Thief &amp; Her Lover (1989) but was one of her best but Cal is only okay.",

The difference was the direction, screenplay and the music.\n\nGovind Nihalani has made a really slow paced movie - but it is never boring. With a lot of slow motion scenes interweaved with the actual storyline the movie moves at anything but a fast pace. However no bit of the movie is boring, superfluous or unnecessary (apart from a couple of songs at the end - but someones got to please the masses).\n\nAll the characters put in a great performance - not the least being Tabu and Ajay. There were some good songs but by the end of the movie they seemed out of place.\n\nAll in all Thakshak is a different action movie. Not too much gruesome violence but with a lot more intensity and power in the dialogues and in the acting. I would easily give it a 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "SPOILERS.\n\nI first saw this some years ago and found it impressive but maybe I&apos;ve seen Lawrence of Arabia too often in the interim. It owes a lot of Lawrence, appearing as it did four years after. As in Lawrence,a lone British officer is sent to the desert to set things straight. He&apos;s mysterious, a paradox. He rides camels and gets into battles with the enemy. He fails in his mission.\n\nWell, Charlton Heston as &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon doesn&apos;t really seem too mysterious when you come down to it, even though he himself tells us, &quot;My life is not an open book. Not to you, not to any man. Not even to myself.&quot; Yet he&apos;s a pretty normal guy. People keep calling him &quot;vain&quot; behind his back but it doesn&apos;t seem like vanity to me when you&apos;re trapped behind the lines and expect the British, who sent you there in the first place, to come and get you out.\n\nActually Heston is pretty good. His mass is imposing. His uniforms are splendiferous. His acting doesn&apos;t shoot out the lights but he&apos;s convincing because Gordon is well within his range. Olivier, as the Mahdi, &quot;the expected one,&quot; the kind of rabid charismatic warrior that religions seem to generate on a regular basis, gives a little better performance because, let&apos;s face it, he&apos;s a more efficient ham. You killed to prevent killing, he tells Gorden. &quot;I kill to prevent more killing. Tell me, Gordon Pasha, where is the difference?&quot; And he holds both his hands up and gives them a little twist, while looking slyly out of the corner of his eyes at Heston. For Heston such techniques would be infra dig. Olivier plays this in blackface, by the way. All of the Egyptians, as well as the Sudanese, are in blackface. Man, these Egyptians are dark. Not just swarthy. Not even dark like sub-Saharan Africa is dark, but a shiny bluish-black like a freshly polished boot.\n\nIt&apos;s not a bad film and it does describe Gordon and his predicament in intelligible terms. We&apos;re never at a loss for what&apos;s going on. But Lawrence of Arabia, inevitably, keeps springing to mind. And Khartoum seems plodding by comparison, especially in the direction. You may remember, to take a single example, the scene in which Lawrence and his irregulars blow up a train and then puncture the cars with machine gun bullets. Lawrence shouts for them to cease fire because the passenger cars are being turned into lacework. Nobody hears him, so he fires a flare. No one pays attention, so Lawrence must run out in front of his own guns screaming at his men to stop shooting. Finally the firing sputters raggedly to a stop.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing like that here. In this movie, Gordon generals a battle on horseback with the Madhi&apos;s supporters and everybody -- every one of the extras -- runs to his mark and does what he&apos;s supposed to. The battles are full of the same extras in long shot, slashing away at each other with scimitars or whatever they are. Nobody seems to get dirty. The dialogue is strictly functional. And one has to think of Lean&apos;s USE of the desert setting. That fulsomely ominous vermilion sun peeking up over the flat spirit level of a horizon at dawn. We have the desert here too, but it might almost have been a painted backdrop. It isn&apos;t a presence. Dearden uses a lot of swooping helicopter shots as if to say, &quot;Wow -- what a vast emptiness.&quot; But we don&apos;t get to KNOW it. We don&apos;t get to see its rocks or its animals or is leisurely dust devils. It might as well be a studio jungle as a desert. \n\nThe score is good, though. It borrows from Eric Wolfgang Korngold but it&apos;s effective -- sweeping, majestic, and rife with breast-bursting button-popping imperial sentiment. \n\nIn the end it&apos;s a watchable epic movie. If you haven&apos;t seen Lawrence of Arabia, rent the two of them and show them in succession -- if you can stay awake that long. It&apos;s the difference between a good-enough movie and a great movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the kind of drama that breaks your heart over and over again without a moment to recover. It&apos;s NOT an easy film to watch. But that&apos;s what makes North Country so extraordinary. Charlize Theron plays Josey Aimes, a young mother who leaves her abusive husband and returns to her hometown to start a new life and support herself and her two kids. Almost immediately, we learn that this is a woman who has been judged, criticized, and ostracized and called a &quot;whore&quot; ever since she became pregnant in high school. Josey takes a job at the local mine because it&apos;s the best paying job she can find, and she&apos;s determined to give her kids a comfortable life. She and her female co-workers are reminded every day how unwanted and unwelcome they are at the mine. They are physically, verbally, mentally, and sexually abused on a daily basis. After being physically attacked and threatened, Josey quits and starts to fight back by suing the company for sexual harassment.\n\nI was finally pushed over the &quot;tears threshold&quot; when Josey&apos;s dad stands up at the miners&apos; union meeting and defends his daughter for the first time in her life. After that, I was sobbing on and off for the entire duration of the film. While the entire cast is perfect, I believe the Best Supporting Actress Nomination must go to Frances McDormand who injects some much-needed comic relief into this bleak-but-brave story. Movies about rape and abuse are never easy to watch, but North Country is such an important story to hear. We as women need to be reminded that women before us suffered and fought for what we take for granted today.",

The American version, directed by the same filmmaker, has done nothing towards clarifying the muddled story and, aside from the great opening sequences, is just a straight-forward recreation of the same suspenseful sequences that somehow don&apos;t play as well. I&apos;d suggest renting the original instead.\n\n5 out of 10.",

This 64 minute film is equally on par with the visionary scope &amp; execution of any American, British, or whoever&apos;s science fiction films from the era. And doubtlessly influenced generations of filmmakers who managed to see it, from Mario Bava through Dan O&apos;Bannon, the Skotek brothers &amp; James Cameron, maybe even yourself.\n\nAs chance may have it the film&apos;s standout effects sequences are better known than some may be aware of. This was one of three Soviet scifi epics who&apos;s American &amp; UK rights were purchased by Roger Corman in the early 1960s -- &quot;Nebo zovyot&quot; (1960), or THE SKY IS CALLING; &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; (1962), or PLANET OF STORMS; and &quot;Mechte navstrechu&quot; (1963), or A DREAM COME TRUE, also known by the more descriptive title ENCOUNTER IN SPACE.\n\nAll were high-profile state run projects celebrating the spirit of adventurism &amp; collective pride that the Soviet people took in their somewhat troubled space program. The Soviets couldn&apos;t put a crew on the moon or Mars or Venus, so they made movies depicting what their fantasists thought it might be like. One of the most striking aspects of the production is the hardware employed. Not just the highly touted, complex and eye popping model effects -- which put even animation greats Gerry Anderson &amp; Derek Meddings to shame -- but the hands-on hardware of the production designs. The space suits, interiors of the spacecraft, tools, computers, devices and contraptions. They all have a kind of visual authority to them that is quite convincing and far from someone stapling a muffin tin to a foil suit to simulate a respirator.\n\n&quot;Nebo zovyot&quot; (also made by this film&apos;s director, Mikhail Karzhukov) took us into space on a sobering, realistic tale of astronauts who put aside the glory of exploration to help the otherwise doomed crew of a rival power&apos;s mission to Mars. Pavel Klushantsev&apos;s more well known &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; actually managed to put its crew on Venus where they &amp; their robot helper encountered all manner of fascinating adventures, though they never met any of the alien damsels who&apos;s haunting presence was only hinted at. Then Karzhukov was brought back for &quot;Mechte navstrechu&quot; where he got to deliver on the promise of alien contact back on Mars. Those Russians got around.\n\nThe premise is actually quite engaging: Loyal party scientists intercept a message from outer space sent by an alien race seeking friendly contact &amp; cheap Russian made cars. An alien emissary is dispatched in the form of a fetching, curvaceous woman looking great in a spacesuit who&apos;s craft crash lands on the windswept surface of Mars. A highly trained Russian crew is sent on a death-defying mission to save her, with various technical problems creating conflict &amp; loss, with some obligatory heroic sacrfice. There&apos;s some flag waving to be sure (though not as obnoxiously as &quot;Nebo zovyot&apos;s&quot; proletariat Worker Day parade ending) but its not like our movies didn&apos;t do the same or worse. The story is more focused on the human interactions of the crew, one of which is of course a foxy Russian babe who could evoke détente just by fluttering her eyebrows. She must have been a hit at the state owned radio factory she worked at for her day job.\n\nNow, the way Corman imported the films was to chop out some of the dialog sections, re-staging new scenes with American audience familiar actors to tell what usually ended up being a perversion of the original story. Then entirely new English dialog would be dubbed over that often had nothing to do with the original Russian stories. See BATTLE BEYOND THE SUN, VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET, and VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN for the other results, all of which are still quite entertaining. The bulk of this film was used by director Curtis Harrington for a charming little movie called QUEEN OF BLOOD (or PLANET OF BLOOD on the AIP TV print which legions of us remember from Saturday afternoon Monster Movie Matinees) that anticipated ALIEN with a less friendly alien emissary tagging a ride back on a human ship for Earth. Leave it to Roger Corman to find unwholesomeness in the most hopeful of scenarios, though good call on snagging the model effects sequences.\n\nThe original unedited Russian version is apparently circulating on an obscure commercial Divex format release from Germany, though I have only been able to find a copy of it so far. Aside from some truly sappy musical segments it is an astounding technical achievement, though I do miss Basil Rathbone imparting dire urgency on the proceedings. The two films couldn&apos;t be more different even if they share the same core 45 minutes or so of footage (plus some additional inserts from the other two Russian films in QUEEN OF BLOOD -- it&apos;s hard to keep track of them!), and its still a fascinating experience for any fan of science fiction cinema.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not going to lie, I was looking forward to Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The production team behind it, in combination with the history of the IP (not to mention the absolutely bonkers trailer) made it seem like Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) level intensity was the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, we were looking at a Jupiter Ascending (2015) a la, a movie with enough sheer lunacy to justify a watch despite being seriously flawed.\n\nSo it&apos;s to my surprise and partially to my chagrin that Valerian is neither of these things - not really. It is a painfully sincere movie that is positively aglow with its own ingenuity, like a toddler is with his own finger painting. And believe it or not, that kind of innocent hubris does save Valerian from quite of few scrapes and contrivances here and there. Yet when the day is done, there&apos;s no denying director Luc Besson&apos;s newest sci-fi space adventure is simultaneously too sloppy and too well made to enjoy.\n\nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is based on a series of French science fiction comics which chronicle the adventures of Valerian (DeHaan) a roguish space cop and his damsel-esque partner Laureline (Delevingne). After their latest mission inadvertently puts them in possession of the film&apos;s magical sci-fi maguffin, they make their way to the fabled space city of Alpha. Once they get there however, all hell breaks loose and our heroes find themselves scrabbling to rescue their superior, Commander Filitt (Owen) from an unknown group of aliens.\n\nThe highs of this movie are near euphoric with some of the most creative and convincing examples of world-building seen this side of blockbuster cinema. The technology, the habitats the creature design et al. are all so refreshingly fun with the city of Alpha being the clear standout of all the marvelous filigree. Alpha at times feels like an ever shifting character in the film, assimilating worthwhile ideas from Star Trek (1966-1969), &quot;John Carter of Mars,&quot; &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; and all points in between. What&apos;s more, the worlds that are created here, you feel like you can come right out and touch them. They practically beg to be explored and thanks in part to the script, you get a decent if breezy tour of Alpha via Valerian and Laureline&apos;s fast-paced adventure.\n\nYet the lows in this movie are almost embarrassingly low, with every bad decision sticking out like Chris Tucker in cheetah print. The problems start almost immediately. Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne for all their efforts are sorely miscast as our heroes; trying desperately to pull off a Han/Leia vibe with the chemistry of flat soda. Much of it can&apos;t be helped of course; partially due to their age they look less like grizzled space cops whom by their own admission &quot;have seen it all,&quot; and more like children playing dress up. You can also just tell what little direction they were given was limited to them hitting their mark and reading their lines, never mind emoting or interacting with the space in any meaningful way.\n\nThere&apos;s also the issue of the plot, which on its own merits is fine and even a little illuminating on paper. Yet due to the way the story unfolds, we&apos;re given everything we need to piece together the themes very early on. Its clear Luc Besson (who also wrote the screenplay) doesn&apos;t want to bog the movie down too much with Avatar (2009) -level messaging. Gadgetry can be argued to be its own reward. But because the movie is in such a rush to whisk us to the next show-stopping set-piece, it all but ignores its problematic elements. Elements that include but are not limited to: a simple &quot;noble savage&quot; vs. militaristic boogeyman narrative, human (alien) trafficking being treated as a fumbled plot device, an alien race modeled after feudal Japanese stereotypes that actually eats people...\n\nYet despite big, big, BIG problems, Valerian still manages to eek out enough good ideas worthy of a tacit recommendation. The bustling city of Alpha, reminiscent of Venice during the Renaissance or Baghdad at the height of the Abbasids is certainly worth a look. Of course if the imagination inherent in a far-future sci-fi smorgasbord isn&apos;t enough to entice you, and you&apos;re more concerned with say story, plot etc. then I say read the graphic novels instead.",

There are points that seem implausible and ask the audiences&apos; indulgence but they are forgivable and do not detract from the story Travolta and Vaughn give solid performances and for me, Buscemi is always fun to watch. Don&apos;t expect the reaffirmation of the virtues of being an involved parent. Expect to finish your popcorn and rasinettes.",

Every time the film becomes a little too dramatic, the director has something funny happen to lighten the atmosphere, which makes for a sweet and touching film. Also, all the characters are complex, so that bad characters do good things and good characters do bad things. Nobody is perfect and nobody is all bad, which makes the film even more realistic. It&apos;s similar to the more recent Get Real, but Beautiful Thing is definitely better. This is without a doubt my favorite gay film. Only the British can make a film this good!",

One wonders if it&apos;s going to be a realistic crude harsh war movie, as we have grown accustomed to in the last years, or a romantic poetic depiction of this folk hero/legend.\n\nAs one gets into the film, one discovers it&apos;s both things. There are several sub themes. The jealousy and competitiveness between brothers, the strong contrasting point of views from how the German pilots lived and saw the war as compared to their infantry mud submerged counterparts, the beauty of the initial sportsmanship displayed by Richthoffen and many other airmen in their practice of war, the love story, and many more.\n\nPerhaps the most appealing to some of us is the gradual turn of things towards the impending tragedy, how the characters seem to express it just in the way they look at each other and how this epic sized hero, well represented by the unknown actor Tomas Koutnik, embraces his fate with a powerlessness and dignity that reflects the whole of humanity&apos;s ultimate choices when faced with the certain end: play out the role you&apos;ve been assigned in this life with dignity.\n\nCongratulations to this director, his craftsmanship, the actors, the staff, and let me not forget specially that wonderful Lena Heady who is very sensual and sublime!",

A very good action film, condemned unseen by many in the west, it represents at least a change of pace by showing the Muslims as the good guys and the Americans as the bad guys. The movie is actually very strongly against terrorism (the Sheikh in the movie criticizes the terrorists who wants to behead an American journalist, and prevents this from happening) but is also against American ignorant meddling in the Middle East. Most of all, though, Valley of the Wolves is a terrific action movie. And Billy Zane - who has apologized to the American press for appearing in this film - has actually one of the best performances in his career as a real meanie.",

Chan-wook Park,  I&apos;m sure few people know of him outside of Korea but talent like this can not go unoticed for long.    I knew nothing of this film or Mr. Park before seeing it at the Seattle International Film Festival.   Human (political?) isolation permeates the film,   connectiveness to others whether familial or conjugal comes with a steep price to pay.   Vengence to reclaim honor is a staple in Asian cinema,  Mr. Park&apos;s &quot;Revenge&quot; completely sidesteps the tired honor formula making us question what happens when normal folk take revenge into the realm of pyschotic?    This is the type of film that  you and your friends will passionately discuss over STRONG drinks afterwords,  there is no nuetrality in opinions, like Solondz&apos;s &quot;Hapiness&quot; you love it or hate it.   As the film ended,  a packed house gave a tepid applause, not because of a lack of enthusiasm, a collective numbness left a pall over the audience,  a raping of all the senses.  Like Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Crash&quot; and Tarkovsky&apos;s &quot;Stalker&quot;,  one becomes defeated by a hypnotic sense of forboding,  you are forced to endure it, pummeled into submission.    The violence is very graphic,  but as much as Mr. Park show&apos;s, it&apos;s what he doesn&apos;t show that makes him so talented,  the subtle use of sound to advance the film is outright brilliance.   Like Takeshi Kitano&apos;s early films,  the extreme violence is never gratuitous yet the like offbeat humor, very unsettling.  &quot;Sympathy For Mr. Vengence&quot; is not  &apos;dark&apos; it is uncompromisingly bleak,  ah but bleakness never looked so good!"

And by the time he plops to the sandy desert. He is then discovered by a driver, Charles Dump (Mario Adorf) who at first was thinking about killing him but in some weird circumstance, he ends up saving his life by pulling the bullet that was stuck inside his shoulder. He does this by driving to a somewhat deserted small mining town who lives with a crazy girl, Jesse (Mascha Rabben) he sometimes calls her as his daughter and an crazy overweight lady, Corina (Betty Segal). And the Kid warns Charles about a guy expected to show up, his nickname is Sunshine (Anthony Dawson) as the somewhat deserted mining area was supposed to be their meeting place.\n\nThe movie was supposed to be in German but is dubbed into English and called &quot;Deadlock&quot; and by watching it, it is reminiscent to better movies made before it from &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and Point Blank and others.\n\nSome of the existing problems with this is the fact that both Charles Dump and the Kid had opportunities to take advantage of the situations and both did not! Such as Charles Dump had the opportunity to just continue on driving as well as ignore the Kid at the opening and he did not. The Kid had the opportunity to have a gun battle with Sunshine and he did not. All this is asinine if you ask me.",

Still young, Chiyoko is approached by a film maker to star in his new film; she accepts and sees this as a chance to find mysterious man. She become a huge success, but she is always empty, never finding the man she loves.\n\nSatoshi Kon has created a wonderful film about the lose of love and the extraordinary lengths one woman will go to find it. What makes this an interesting watch is that when we go into Chiyoko&apos;s past, Genya and his camera man also walk around in her past; interacting with people. But its just not a trek through her past, her memories meld with the movies she has made; as the movies parallel her life on her journey of finding her love, but also time in history. The scenes we see are from the movies she has made, but the story is her own life; her reality and her imagination have just crashed into one another.\n\nThe animation here is just visually amazing. Satoshi Kon&apos;s character designs are so unique they set themselves apart from another animations. All the backgrounds are so detailed and textured. What i find great is that Satoshi Kon adds that tiny bit of surrealism; adding more dimension and thought, here its how Chiyoko&apos;s memories meld into the movies she&apos;s starred in. Satoshi&apos;s script is so deep and full of angst. Its hard to watch this woman on her quest for love always failing; yet she blindly keeps going no matter what.\n\nAt great movie about the journey of love and how its never ending; in this world and the next.",

With the recent revival of pro wrestling, it is a shame that this film stays buried in the MGM/UA film library.  All the Marbles, is the story of the California Dolls, 2 very attractive lady wrestlers seeking wrestling work and fame in seedy blue collar cities and towns of Mid America.  Their manager is Peter Falk.  They hope to leverage their good looks and athletic talents into the major league of pro wrestling.  This film had a first rate director, capable cast, and was well written.  It was a shame that it failed at the box office.  While lady wrestling is not currently mainstream, things are changing, women can be stronger and better trained and more and more people are watching wrestling.  Weekly pro wrestling attracts more TV viewers than weekly baseball.  Hey MGM, how &apos;bout putting All the Marbles back on TV."

      "reviewBody": "Take note all you horrible makers of today&apos;s movies. This is how you make a bad movie. You do not bring in a stupid 80&apos;s mall queen, make a film with monsters that are clearly not there, and you do not skimp on the gore and nudity! No, you make a monster out of stuff just laying around, you have young gals that look like they would be more at home in an adult film, and you have lots of gore and nudity like this film does! Is it a good movie, absolutely not, but it is certainly very enjoyable to watch. Though saying this one is absolutely not good may be being a bit to harsh as I actually enjoyed the story here a bit more than other &quot;Alien&quot; knock off movies of this era. Heck, I enjoyed watching his film more than &quot;Alien 3&quot;, though that film was clearly better done this one was more entertaining and I was never bored. The film starts out kind of weakly though as dude and his robot pal have a pointless space battle. I do not know who or why they are fighting these people, I don&apos;t think it is our business. Once they go to the planet of Xarbia though things really pick up. The guy in the ship is some sort of problem solver and the problem they are having on this planet is that an experiment has gotten a bit out of hand. Killed a bunch of animals and has now retreated to a cocoon. Well it is not to long before it gets out and of course some idiot could have easily ended the entire movie by being a bit more careful, but then the movie would have ended even sooner than its very short running time of 77 minutes. Lots of gore ensues as the creature mutates forms from time to time and its purpose is soon to be known. During this time you get the typical scientist that does not want to harm the creature, but capture it and an even more laughable attempt at communicating with the beast. You also get lots of boobies from the two females at this little research place. Like I said it was a fun watch, the monster looks okay in some scenes and in others it looks bad, kind of like a blown up garbage bag. However, even when it looks bad it is there unlike so many computer generated monsters of today. The film could actually use a bit more time as they could have added ten minutes and had even more deaths and the death of the one guy trying to fix something was weak compared to others. The cast is all right, the lead guy being rather good. One of the females was super hot, the other with the more blond hair was just okay. Just wished they would make cheap movies like this instead of the boring stuff they do now. I am betting this is actually cheaper to make and a lot more fun to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Kevin Bacon directs this bizarre story adapted by Hannah Shakespeare from Victoria Redel&apos;s novel about maternal obsession providing his wife Kyra Sedgwick with a role to spotlight just how fine an actress she truly is. The story is disturbing but vitally interesting. There are problems with the film, the most annoying one being that the dialogue is practically inaudible due to the miking and, more so, due to the musical score which covers all the lines to the point of making the movie seem like a silent movie with music from the pit! Such a shame, because it SEEMS like this is a good script with a lot to say.\n\nEmily (Kyra Sedgwick) is damaged goods, a woman neglected as a child who is determined to have a baby and raise it on her own, lavishing the child with all the affection and attention she desperately missed. After numerous attempts to get pregnant from any available man, she finally succeeds impregnation with Campbell Scott and gives birth to Paul (Dominic Scott Kay) who becomes her entire reason for living. She sequesters Paul form the world, gives him everything a child could want - except association with peers. Her obsession grows to the point of mental illness and the results are devastating. Along the way Emily and Paul encounter people who seek to intervene in their lives: these people are played with great style by cameo roles of Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, Matt Dillon, Blair Brown and even some of the Bacon&apos;s own children! It is a star cast obviously committed to Kevin Bacon&apos;s vision of this star vehicle for Sedgwick.\n\nThe pacing, cinematography, and acting are all first rate. If only the ugly and senseless music hadn&apos;t submerged the dialogue (oddly enough the score was written by Michael Bacon!), this would be an Oscar contender.",

Jake Taylor is back as a coach helping Manager Lou Brown guide the misguided. Roger Dorn is back with an even larger ego. Announcer Harry Doyle is outspoken as ever, but I think he made a bigger impact in the first movie.\n\nCharlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Tom Berenger, James Gammon, Margaret Whitton and Bob Uecker reprise their roles with relish. Well, Berenger probably could have phoned in his part. Added to the mix are Omar Epps, David Keith and Takaaki Ishibashi.\n\nBatter up and take your cuts. This is fun to watch back to back with the first gathering of baseball cut ups."

      "reviewBody": "THE PERFECT MAN is another one of those fluff romantic comedies that just keep recycling - single mom and pseudorebellious daughter make everything work after plotted plans go astray. This is one of those films that you rent because the video store is closing and you need a somnolent-inducing DVD. But in the case of THE PERFECT MAN there are some nice surprises!\n\nJean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) is a 40ish single mom who bakes specialty cakes and can&apos;t land a man. Whenever she gets close to a commitment or when she is passed by, she runs, family in tow, to a new city, new friends, new opportunities to find a man before she is too old. Her daughters Holly (Hilary Duff) age 16 and little Zoe (Aria Wallace) go along with the transplanting moves, understanding and supportive of their mother but yearning for some permanence. The newest move is to Brooklyn: Jean is welcomed back to a bakery of friends, Holly finds reasons to like her new school (friends female and male) and Zoe starts on a run toward a spelling bee. Since Jean is so desperate for a man, she is swept off her feet by a fellow baker who is sweet but otherwise fairly low on the food chain. Holly and her new friend Amber (Michelle Nolden) plan a way to capture Jean&apos;s attention from a created secret lover, their information comes from Amber&apos;s restaurateur Uncle Ben (Chris Noth) who tells them the secrets to winning a woman&apos;s heart.\n\nLet the games begin: first flowers, then gifts, then letters, then email, then I&apos;m, and Jean feels as though there really is someone special out there who loves her. But as all games go, this one has its successes and major failures and as Holly grows to understand her mother&apos;s dilemma, she finds her own in her reluctance to accept the fact that her friend Adam (Ben Feldman) has fallen for her and wants her around. From that point it is a comedy of errors until the final frames where, as expected, all works out for the best for everyone.\n\nShallow, yes. Been there, done that, yes. But the surprise is the growth of Heather Locklear as an actress! She has come along ways from her &apos;Dynasty&apos;/&apos;Melrose Place&apos; days as basically set decor and has accepted her age gracefully, coupling that with a nuanced acting ability that makes her a welcome &apos;newcomer&apos; to the screen. She is worth sitting through this little yawner, making it come alive every time she is on screen. Grady Harp",

From carefree youth to dying day Dunne gives an incredibly restrained yet powerfully emotional effort of a woman who signs her own death warrant to the American ideal.\n\nRay Schmidt is one elusive chick to the men chasing her. On to the traveling salesman con she also rejects the well intentioned local boy with promise Kurt Schlender who nevertheless remains persistent. One day at the train depot she&apos;s introduced to Walter Saxel (John Boles). The two hit it off and embark on an on off affair until the day they die.\n\nDunne endures the highs and lows of the relationship with a low key melancholy, much of it reflected in her eyes and long silences that reaches the audience and speaks volumes. The tragic chemistry between the two is evident in many of their scenes as they knowingly play out the doomed affair that will never attain respectability with a wan despair.\n\nStahl along with cameraman Karl Freund provide one fine background after the next with some beautiful set pieces as well some tender two shot close-ups of the star crossed lovers conflicted by their desperate passion for each other and the &quot;proper &quot; thing to do. A top rate tearjerker.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film as part of the Cinemuerte Horror Film Festival in Vancouver recently, and I have to say that I did enjoy it, as silly as it was.\n\nThe characters were affable, the zombie and gore effects were solid, and the storyline was good fun. You actually got to like the three &quot;losers&quot; and the preppy-rich kids were fun to hate. Don&apos;t listen to the person who commented on &quot;bad acting&quot;, because they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about. There was no bad acting in this movie at all. The actors were all very natural, and seemed like real teenagers, despite the fantastic situations they were in. \n\nAnyway, when this film will reach DVD on North American shores is hard to tell, but if you like 80&apos;s-style teen comedy flicks, and are a fan of zombies and gore (there are some gross and violent scenes, but nothing as extreme as what you&apos;d see in a Romero film, and they&apos;re mostly played for laughs), then this film is good for a laugh and worth renting. It&apos;s certainly better than most teen flicks coming out of Hollywood these days!",

Carlo Aquino is one of the best actors of all time. If only, Tom Taus can be added here, this would be the famas best movie of the universe since the big bang of bang bus by dirty sanchez and ramon. If only cytheria was here.\n\nFor Me, kokey is the embodiment of all the love in the world. He is like E.T. with cancer and aids at the same time. This movie has a lot of lessons. in fact, it showed me that &quot;time is gold,&quot; and &quot;kids, no dunk.&quot; Someday, i want to become like you because Kokey, you are so A-OK.",

Our night was ruined because of this, it just put us all on downers, and everyone left early.\n\nThis was a flat stale piece of un-funny junk, no wonder people take to downloading movies, they feel they don&apos;t want to risk parting with their money.\n\nI could direct and write a much funnier movie than this dribble with my eyes closed. I feel really sorry for these great actors who were dragged into this mush. Although I am sure they had a great vacation together in Hawaii and enjoyed the pay cheque, it did not do their reputations to great.\n\nThis film was painfully dull to watch, so much it hurt, and now to add insult to injury I have got to go all the way back to the video shop to take the damn thing back.\n\nSigh!"

      "reviewBody": "O.J. Simpson: Juice on the Loose (1974) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nIn between THE CRAZIES and MARTIN, director George A Romero and producer Richard Rubenstein made this documentary, which shows what a special player O.J. Simpson was in college as well as in the NFL.\n\nObviously, when you watch this documentary today you can&apos;t help but think of what happened to Simpson after this was made. Obviously this film just covers him up until 1972 as we get his football career as well as some brief bits of information about him moving into movies. There&apos;s even a mention of THE KLANSMAN that he made.\n\nOne really can&apos;t help but think of what happened after these events but at the same time, for the most part, this was a pretty good documentary. I&apos;d argue that its 47-minute running time drags at times but there&apos;s still a lot of interesting information to be had here. The film has O.J. speaking throughout so we get to hear his thoughts on his career as well as what else he wants to do in life. There are some moments of his first wife speaking as well as clips of O.J. and his son playing.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for something ground-breaking then you&apos;re not going to get it here but it is fascinating seeing how Simpson was looked out during this period. There are interviews with several of his coaches and team mates as well as A.C. Cowlings and Howard Cosell. Fans of Romero won&apos;t find any of his trade mark stuff here as this was pretty much just a job."

      "reviewBody": "I watch upwards of 300 movies a year and use IMDb like a fiend, but only this movie has ever compelled me to register and comment. &quot;Shooting Dogs&quot; is a BBC Films/UK Film Council film about the genocide in Rwanda that was ignored whilst the international community pontificated about the language used to describe what was going on (i.e. &quot;Acts of genocide&quot; vs &quot;genocide&quot;). The film focuses on the desperate plight of 2500 Tutsis seeking shelter in a school-cum-UN military compound. It goes some way to explain the history of the situation and the events surrcounding the genocide.\n\nWhat makes this movie special is that a number of the production crew are survivors of the Rwandan crisis, and are telling their own stories. As macho as i would love to sound, i had tears in my eyes and felt the pain, hopelessness and indignation - and those are things that no director can claim to have brought to life for me in anything i&apos;ve watched until now (the closest was probably the magnificent &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;). Nothing is held back, and not should it be. The horror here is not graphic close-ups, but the shocking disregard for life that leads to the slaughter of newborn babies with machetes, the abject impotence of the UN and how tribal loyalties can turn the closest of friends into murderers.\n\nFor those who have lived in Africa (as i have), what is portrayed here is all too real. Like is said by one BBC reporter in the movie, in the Balkans the people were white and they could have been your own mother, but in Rwanda its worse than numbness - its just another dead African. Ignore your preconceptions, assumptions and instant reaction to skip to the next title because its not familiar, it wasn&apos;t in the cinema and Hotel Rwanda didn&apos;t appeal to you much. The impact this movie had on me was that profound, and i&apos;d urge anyone to watch it to understand what happened there.\n\nAnd when the credits come up and you&apos;ve had time to think it over and resolve that it should never happen again, i&apos;d say one word to you: Darfur. It just happened again only recently.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie came onto the scene with very little fanfare. It isn&apos;t a CGI powerhouse. There&apos;s no Matrix/Kill Bill style fight scenes. But what it lacks in modern trends it more than makes up for in a good old fashioned revenge plot. Touting a story that would have been fit for a Clint Eastwood flick like Outlaw Josey Wales or Hang &apos;em High, the Punisher takes the viewer on journey into the soul of a gritty vigilante. Thomas Jane plays the lead role to perfection, his voice acting is incredible. Although this isn&apos;t your daddy&apos;s (or Dolph&apos;s) emotionless Punisher. He is much more cerebral here than in most of the other media he has popped up in, and more human, but not any more humane. Using the tried and true style of fist fights and pyrotechnics this movie keeps the character rooted in his all too mortal persona. The supporting characters turn in equally descent roles, the likes of John Travolta worked well, although nothing outstanding. No doubt about it, Thomas Jane ran away with this one. He&apos;s just a normal guy doing super-normal things, with a lot of gunfire and explosions to boot. If you are in the target demographic (Male aged 17-30) you will definitely enjoy this film. If not, proceed at your own risk.",

      "reviewBody": "Johnny Apollo was Darryl F. Zanuck&apos;s attempt probably at Tyrone Power&apos;s request to give him some more challenging material. Up to this time Power&apos;s films were mostly either costume period dramas or screen comedies. For the first time Ty is in modern dress and in a drama.\n\nPower fits the title role of Johnny Apollo rather well. The name is a spur of the moment creation for Robert Cain, Jr. who would be called a trust fund baby today. His widower father Edward Arnold&apos;s indictment for some white collar securities violations has put Power&apos;s rather well ordered and soft universe to a sudden end.\n\nPower tries to play it straight, but can&apos;t make a go of it. Circumstances put him and gangster Lloyd Nolan together. And Power discovers he&apos;s got a talent for the rackets. He also attracts the attention of Nolan&apos;s girl friend Dorothy Lamour. \n\nJohnny Apollo is a good film with crackerjack performances by the cast that Henry Hathaway directed. It&apos;s probably best compared to MGM&apos;s Johnny Eager where Louis B. Mayer was also trying to broaden their studio&apos;s heartthrob Robert Taylor&apos;s appeal. Johnny Eager is the better film, but no one in Johnny Apollo need be ashamed of anything.\n\nBest performances in the film are from Nolan as gangster Mickey Dwyer. Nolan was never bad in any film he was ever in. Second best is alcoholic mob attorney Charley Grapewin.\n\nDorothy Lamour was brought over from Paramount for this film, playing a part that Alice Faye or Betty Grable might normally have been assigned to. She gets two of her best movie songs to sing, This Is The Beginning Of The End by Mack Gordon and Your Kiss by Frank Loesser and Lionel Newman.\n\nJohnny Apollo is a fine gangster film from a studio that normally did not do that particular genre. At least at this time.",

      "reviewBody": "Whats not to like about this movie? Well, the violent and the dark, at times manic context which prevails in a good share of the scenes, together with the perversity thats being thrown at you in the most unsubtle way. Nick Nolte&apos;s Brennan must be the most foul,intimidating and maniacal cop figure ever portrayed since Orson Welles&apos; Captain Quinlan in &quot;Touch of evil&quot;. He pulls off a great performance, although not very pleasant to watch (nor listen, for that matter).\n\nWhats there to like about this movie? For one thing, there is Armand Assante and what most likely is the role of his career, even if its a supporting one and he gets only a couple scene stealers. He demonstrates how great he can be if given the right part. And his role is very interesting, an archcriminal with feelings, brought out by a woman who may not even love him.\n\nJenny Lumet was also good in her role, although I missed more interaction between her and Assante&apos;s character. Timothy Hutton, although overshadowed by Nolte and Assante in turns (inevitable really), proves again that he is a solid actor.His performance is not spectacular(as the role doesn&apos;t allow it), but its worthwhile. Another great presence by Patrick O&apos;Neal as the sly and cunning district attorney with a criminal past and ties to Bobby Texador(Assante).\n\nSidney Lumet is the master of socio-political drama/comedy/thriller. Here he mixes all three into an enjoyable, intriguing and satisfactory work. This film deserves more attention than I believe it got. But again, looking at its &quot;walk on the wild side&quot; perspective, it really couldn&apos;t have become a blockbuster hit an average person chooses to watch on video or DVD on a Saturday night.",

      "reviewBody": "Pluses: 1. Great cast. Really good chemistry among them. Terrific performances from all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets better with every film she makes. 2. Story keeps you guessing until the end. 3. There are references in it to some popular films in the genre (that are likely film maker favorites) from the past 30 years or so. 4. Director shows great promise while still early in his career. 4. Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.\n\nMinuses: 1. We&apos;ve probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There&apos;s a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.\n\nSince the film has the word &quot;Cloverfield&quot; in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn&apos;t. Using Cloverfield in the title was likely just another reference to a favorite film.\n\nSome people didn&apos;t understand the ending. Huh? They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn&apos;t Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be. The actions of Winstead&apos;s character at the end of the film make perfect sense in light of a monologue she delivered earlier, which apparently was ignored by those whining about the ending.\n\nDon&apos;t listen to the naysayers. It isn&apos;t high art, but it&apos;s an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.",

      "reviewBody": "I wont ever get anything worthwhile as far as true scares with Leprechaun. Maybe if I were younger the effect would be with a stronger, stranger response, because the make-up- which is extremely well-crafted- and the un-hinged demented brilliance of Warwick Davis could be creepy for a kid. As an adult, however, a LOT of this is quite silly, the kind of flick that might&apos;ve been presented as the St. Patrick&apos;s Day special on the grind-house circuit back in the 70s. Which means that what it lacks in any sort of quality and carries with idiot characters, it does a good enough job of making up for it as a comedy. There&apos;s next to no real character development at all, but who needs with then with a little green man running around...excuse me, riding around (on a variety of little goofy vehicles). The writer&apos;s make a self-conscious effort to make it in a predictable style, at least at first (they also waste no time getting to the Leprechaun at the start). The director Mark Jones makes shallow attempts for &apos;different&apos; angles at times (lets do a quick tilt here, a little extra grand-guignol there), but it&apos;s really the Warwick Davis show at the end of the day, and the crazy situations that come out of his dogged attempt at one thing- his pot of gold! \n\nA funnier side too is just suddenly seeing the name Jennifer Ansiton in the opening credits- a first time acting job that feels very much like one. She and the rest of the main human characters are pretty standard as somehow able enough to stay on their toes with such a wretched little s.o.b., but it goes without saying you&apos;ll come across the very inane dialog exchange or just tepid moment of &quot;acting&quot; (Mark Holton as Ozzie is an example of this). Meanwhile, the Leprechaun rides his tricycles and scooters, and sometimes runs like hell (in truly over-the-top action sequences), and its usually a gas if not entirely workable as horror. Whatever cheap thrills do come around, its never anything totally exciting. But I wouldn&apos;t trade some of the Leprechaun&apos;s classically mad turns of phrasing (&quot;This old Lep, he played one. He played pogo on his lung&quot;). That little near 4 foot ball of comedic bravado makes the picture somewhat memorable, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;d have fun again watching it again some time soon. Cleverest bit of old-time cliché logic: the Leprechaun&apos;s ability to talk in other voices ala the Terminator as a trick on those around the corner. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Just a few cameras placed in two or three spots in the courtroom. it is a court that deals with small crimes. The movie could so easily have been one of &apos;human drama&apos; or &apos;human condition&apos;, or another easy cliché.\n\nBut the director tactfully avoids doing such a facile movie. In the silences, in the gazes exchanged you can see a black guy charged with marijuana dealing, be transformed from young boy to old man. you can actually see it in his eyes when his verdict is told. you can see what law does, and how it does it.\n\nyou can literally see class, gender and race in this simple movie. simple here is something that is attained after hundreds of hours of shooting, editing and a lot of thought. You can see how law with all the sincerity fails to deliver justice.\n\nBut most important is the pace of the movie, and the editing. First it gets us acquainted with the legal process, the characters are introduced, the judge, the prosecutors. We get familiarized with the setting, the bench, the process. These are done through the cases of characters that we can easily associate. Just when we are done we move to more complicated cases, that of the Arab thief, that of bans from France... It introduces us the process enough and leaves us at the right place to look through it ourselves. And the two conclusive sessions, of the nerdy sociologist -that just would not get what law is about- and of the guy who is just-too-honest-for-the-law are simply great. Such humor and mind boggling, simple, ambivalence."

      "reviewBody": "Arthur Miller&apos;s knockout play The Crucible was published in 1952, so it always struck me as odd that we didn&apos;t get a film version until 1996- after the Cold War ended. It&apos;s been a decade since I saw the 1996 adaptation, and I wasn&apos;t impressed by it. I don&apos;t totally remember why, but I thought it was a mistake to actually show the girls engaged in witchcraft-like activities and thought the ending was a bit abrupt, cutting off Proctor&apos;s prayer on the gallows. But as it turns out, it actually wasn&apos;t the original film version. The first was a French movie from 1957- The Crucible, or The Witches of Salem.\n\nI did like this version better. Although it too shows the girls engaged in witch-like activities (indeed, in this version Abigail appears to be a bona fide witch), it seems slightly more restrained. All of the subject matter involving the supernatural and the political made this movie intriguing and compelling to me. After watching 15 minutes or so, I knew I wanted more. The 1957 film definitely borrows from Miller&apos;s play but in a way it is its own take on the Salem witch trials of 1692. It manages to get its point across adequately. It does strike me as odd that the French and Germans would take interest in a witch case from America when Europe had many brutal witch hunts of its own- but setting the story in Salem is true to Miller&apos;s story which is the obvious inspiration.",

      "reviewBody": "Underrated. I won&apos;t belabor relating and describing the plot, because that&apos;s been recited nicely by numerous others. I&apos;ll simply return to my one word point. Underrated. Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance, an award she earned and much deserved, I still say underrated. This film really never got on the public&apos;s radar the way it should have, probably because there are no big-name actors featured as box office draw. Joe Pesci was as good as it gets that way. In 1991 he was the hottest name in the cast. But has Joes Pesci ever established himself as a leading man who could carry a movie by himself? I ask that in open-ended wonderment, and certainly not disparagingly. Just asking, is it fair, has it ever been fair, to expect Joe Pesci to carry a film?\n\nRegardless of Joe Pesci&apos;s latent starpower, this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave, not only in their interactions with one another, but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts, beyond any of their individual levels of genius, certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them. Competent though they may have been, these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants. You ever wonder why this singular performance 15+ years ago and counting remains Marisa Tomei&apos;s magnum opus? That might be one big reason why. The Germans have a word for this. It&apos;s called gestalt. \n\nMy inclination is to give most of the credit for this winning final product to director Jonathan Lynn. It seems obviously to be his creation. Who else singularly deserves it? Along the way it would have been such a cheap trick and easy thing to surrender to the obvious, but Lynn didn&apos;t do it. This is a story built around stereotypes. New Yorkers. Ethnic Italian New Yorkers. Southerners. Small town southerners. Southern justice. Southern small town justice with New York Italians in the dock. It would have been so easy to traffic in those stereotypes, to over-the-top cash in on them, to submerge the movie in them and to exploit them for all they were worth. These people could have been made into cardboard cartoons of themselves. Surely the Englishman Lynn was thusly tempted, but it was a temptation he mainly resisted. Oh, almost obligatorily, he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that, but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes, he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction, indeed in an uplifting direction. Just as there are no cheap tricks in this movie, there are no cheap shots either. People are not ridiculed for who they are or where they are from. It rises above that. Lynn raises it above that. Yes, the regional differences that exist are juxtaposed. And yes, we get the fact that cultural differences divide these characters. But the beauty of it is that no one is treated unfairly. In fact, the viewer comes away with the feeling that these are all good people. \n\nJoe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are given a broad canvas to create great humorous art, bouncing one, two, three liners or more off of each other, at the other&apos;s expense. It&apos;s the game they play with each other, the nature of their characters&apos; relationship, and it&apos;s fun to watch. And this must be said: not only does Marisa give an exquisite performance, she is an utterly delightful feminine creature to watch here. As for the southerners, in not taking the bait to exploit the southerners as dumb hicks, Lynne actually captures part of the true but rarely portrayed essence of the south: polite gentility. Lane Smith embodies that essence. And Fred Gwynne? He practically steals the show, and would have were it not for Marisa Tomei.\n\nWhat has been going through Joe Pesci&apos;s and Marisa Tomei&apos;s heads for the last 15 years? What is wrong with their agents? These two needed a sequel. If not a sequel, then more film(s) together. The dynamic between them was too good to just be abandoned. We should have been treated to much more of them together.\n\nAs a trial lawyer let me say that the portrayal of courtroom events, while certainly not perfect, is more than adequate and passable. One thing that is accurately captured is the fish-out-of-water experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a far-flung rural county. This depicton conveys the essence of what that&apos;s like.\n\nThis movie deserves more recognition. It is clever, funny, and fun. I recommend it. If you haven&apos;t seen it, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself.",

With his intense anger and hatred for the exploiters and supported by good looks his performance is quite impressive. Kazan is a genius with his direction, all the main actors are superb starting from Brando, Quinn and the bad guy. I can&apos;t imagine why &apos;they&apos; gave the Oscar to Gray Cooper for High Noon when Brando&apos;s performance in Viva Zapata clearly outdid Gary&apos;s, I have seen both the movies and Brando deserves it without a second thought. Well, Brando didn&apos;t care and that&apos;s the best part, he certainly is the BEST in method acting and this movie shows just how talented and gifted as an actor he was. \n\nThe movie overall is a classic, poetic, rebellious and based on the life of the revolutionary Zapata in Mexico. There are a number a similarities with Che Guevara, war tactics and the way he lives and spares no one when it comes to his ideals. It&apos;s must watch for the lovers of classic, artistic cinema."

      "reviewBody": "In London, the lawyer Kate Beckenham (Natascha McElhone) is near to her wedding day with her fiancé Graham (Valentine Pelka), when she is invited to defend a heritage case against the brilliant lawyer Jack Sullivan (James Frain), who has never lost a case in court. The twenty-one years old American Mirella Burton (Parker Posey) is disputing fifteen millions of pounds and some properties against Gerald Burton Jr (Charles Dance), the inherited son of her deceased husband. During the trial, the romantic Kate falls in love for Jack, and sees the case in another perspective.\n\n&quot;What Rats Won&apos;t Do&quot; is a very British romantic-comedy, but also very pleasant. In spite of having many jokes with the British peculiarities and behavior, the enjoyable story is very supported by the nice cast and the good chemistry between the gorgeous Natascha McElhone and James Frain. In the end, love wins and this movie entertains, without being special. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Um Caso de Amor&quot; (&quot;A Love Affair&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bees&quot; is a gloriously awful animal attack thriller marked by some truly incompetent filmmaking, a ridiculous script, and some hilariously insipid acting. The story involves the corporate smuggling of killer bees into America, which causes a massive swarm such as the country has never seen. The scientists desperately trying to solve the problem (John Saxon as the egghead hero, the ravishing Angel Tompkins as his love interest, John Carradine as her German accented father) realize that they&apos;re going to have their hands full.\n\nLed by director Alfredo Zacharias (&quot;Demonoid&quot;), the filmmakers here miss any horror in the premise by bungling almost every action scene. Most of the time, the only possible reaction to the goings-on is laughter. Granted, some of the humor *is* intentional - there is an occasional priceless line such as &quot;That&apos;s adding incest to injury.&quot; When it comes to the insect cast, we have a practical cast of thousands, and regarding the human actors, Saxon gamely tries to look serious, and Carradine is as genial as he&apos;s ever been. Mexican icon Claudio Brook appears early on as Tompkins&apos; husband. There&apos;s even an appearance by the &quot;President&quot;! Highlights include a good ol&apos; boy hiring kids to procure bees for him so he can treat his rheumatism with bee stings. There&apos;s a fair bit of violence and a couple of impressive vehicle crashes. Everything is capped off with a delightfully idiotic music score (composed by Richard Gillis) that completely works against any suspense that Zacharias and company might otherwise have created. The ending is priceless and right in tune with so many other ecologically themed thrillers of the 70s.\n\nWarner Bros., the makers of &quot;The Swarm&quot;, went so far as to pay off New World, the American distributors of this flick, to delay their release so the two movies wouldn&apos;t be in direct competition.\n\nFive out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this documentary a couple of months ago and I had a very enjoyable time knowing a little more about Brit rock sensation The Smiths. Simple and safe, and very informative the project makes a summarization of the group, their albums and the singles that made them one of the most important groups of the 1980&apos;s. Interviews with producers, musicians who knew them during their fame years (1982-1987) sharing stories about the group formation, the act on stage or on studio; and there&apos;s also some music fans who share their views on some particular tracks and albums. Archive interviews with lead singer/composer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr are also featured but no updated words from theirs or Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce appears.\n\nMost of what it&apos;s told I knew beforehand, other stories and facts were completely new to me (mostly related about Craig Gannon&apos;s brief stint with the band and the man himself appears here; and the late Tony Wilson has plenty of good stories to share about Morrissey&apos;s early years. It&apos;s a real treat); but it worked for me. Haven&apos;t seen many other documentaries or specials about the band so I can&apos;t compare with others unless some epic documentary with all the band members sharing their views and their stories come along.\n\nIt&apos;s a fine documentary, no question about it, but it can be problematic or annoying to hardcore fans who have their own personal opinions about a particular album or one particular song wheneve the people featured here starts to express their opinions on those issues. Sometimes it&apos;s hard to keep on listening to those - there&apos;s a whole criticism against &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; that not only is a very underrated album but it also happens to be Moz and Marr&apos;s personal favorite of theirs. If interested in the story and their career is quite interesting to follow, just pay no mind to the personal insights of the figures interviewd. To new fans, this is highly recommended. 9/10.",

These facts lead him to a journey throughout his life, an inside journey. &quot;The other&quot; is the man that he is not any longer, or the one that he is never going to be (other professions, other backgrounds).Life, death and time. The film is simple in appearance: Juan takes a bus and walks along the streets, meets different people, changes his name, etc. but it invites you to feel and understand his experience, that is human experience. Juan is very well performed by Julio Chávez and the characters look like people in a dream. In fact, I think that if it would have been a dream it wouldn&apos;t make any difference. i do not recommend this film to very young people, of those who like action and a clear argument. It is a film for people in the forties who like to think and discuss about important things in life.",

Which means that men are all the same no matter what planet they derive...\n\nFor a robotic-like Barry Stokes it&apos;s a complicated (and often risky) lesson of love and jealousy in what&apos;s an offbeat triangle within a low-budget science-fiction horror, with plenty of intended downtime...\n\nGiving the feel that cult director Norman J. Warren&apos;s PREY is actually more of a deliberately slow-paced arthouse thriller, and, filmed in England with British actors, the acting&apos;s quite good when it really shouldn&apos;t be...\n\nFeaturing the more feminine and once straight Glory Annen (with an unseen backstory involving an ex-husband), who&apos;s given either loving/controlling kisses or dirty/frustrated looks by her shorter-haired yet equally attractive Sally Faulkner, the most fun is how the bickering couple tries figuring out this strange male visitor, who winds up like a benign, manipulated little brother of sorts...\n\nMeanwhile the taboo exploitation gets sporadically intruded upon by what hardcore horror fans want much more of, like gruesome body count deaths by the alien, particularly while sporting full fangs, an interstellar wolfman, who, despite having plenty to watch (as a voyeur along with the intended male audience) has very little to do.",

Its artistic value is way less than of an average TikTok video.\n\nIt&apos;s got a bit a vibe (not of a horror movie, but of a sad despair incoherent swamp), but you would spend at least 2 minutes of your life staring at an old&apos;s man portrait.\n\nWaste of time.

      "name": "Love Hurts, Literally",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fingernails&quot; is a film that tries to grasp the complexities of love with a literal, and somewhat bizarre, twist. The premise of a test, requiring the sacrifice of a fingernail to determine true love, is as intriguing as it is absurd. This oddball concept, though, is the backbone of a narrative that oscillates between deep introspection and sheer melodrama.\n\nThe film shines in its portrayal of human emotions and the desperation to find and affirm love. The performances, especially by the lead actors, are commendable. They successfully navigate through a script that is at times heartfelt and at others, bordering on the ludicrous. The movie&apos;s exploration of love&apos;s multifaceted nature and the inherent loneliness in seeking its validation is thought-provoking. However, the plot meanders, often getting lost in its own philosophical musings and leaving viewers wondering if the narrative could have been tightened.\n\nThe visual storytelling in &quot;Fingernails&quot; is a mixed bag. Cinematography adeptly captures the sterile, clinical atmosphere of the Love Institute, juxtaposing it against the emotional turmoil of the characters. But the literal &apos;fingernail test&apos; scenes are a bit too on the nose, almost comical, undermining the film&apos;s attempts at gravitas. The subplot involving Anna&apos;s relationship with Amir and the ensuing ethical and emotional dilemmas adds layers to the story but also muddles the central theme. The film&apos;s climax, intended to be a poignant resolution, feels rushed and somewhat unearned, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Fingernails&quot; is an ambitious film that gets points for originality but falters in execution. It&apos;s a movie that will make you think and cringe. It&apos;s not a masterpiece, but it&apos;s definitely not a nail-biter either - pun intended. For those who enjoy unconventional love stories with a touch of existential dread, this movie might just be a quirky addition to your watchlist.",

The storyline is completely believable in that a desperate guy played by Thomas Ian Nicholas aided by his good buddies that he also convinces to assist him and themselves,{they don&apos;t need to much convincing mind you} to cook up a scheme to &quot;meet as many women/girls as possible, by putting advertisements in the paper and creating a fake casting call for a movie that really doesn&apos;t exist! A person definitely gets the sense that this cooked up idea may have been attempted in the past by &quot; guys looking to meet and date as many women as they can&quot;. Ask any producer or director and they will tell you that casting calls routinely can draw literally hundreds if not thousands of people that want to audition for parts.I have seen most of the National Lampoons and this rates up there for believability,acting skills, realism and humor. At the premiere I happened to sit next to a very well known &quot;movie critic&quot; and for what it&apos;s worth he gave it &quot;two thumbs up&quot;!!! &quot;A MUST SEE SLEEPER COMEDY THAT WILL BE COMING OUT IN THE THEATRES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 07 !!!!!!!!!!!!!1",

I TRULY did believe him. His voice is soft and melodic and based on the above review I learned he is an actor. The cinematography is stunning. How they get cameras in certain places I will never know. What pleased me the most was that their is barely any talking during the scenes. The narration is during breaks not OVER the cinematography. The visuals are crisp and clear and a joy to behold. I am truly trying to get my children to watch this from start to finish, I snagged one during the snake and egg scene, which I will not spoil for you, but which is AMAZING. Do yourself and your family a HUGE favor and try to catch this wonderful, wonderful film/documentary. From start to finish it is a joy.",

      "reviewBody": "Athletes often face a rough mid-life period as their skills diminish and their careers wind down, since their sport so defines who and what they are. This topic has great potential for drama and poignancy, yet few good films have been made on the subject. This movie has a beautifully sad central love story, with aging minor league ballplayer Billy Wyatt (Mark Harmon) remembering the (then) older woman who inspired him so many years before (Jodie Foster), and trying to come to terms with the route his career and life have taken. So, he returns to his hometown, connects with his high school best friend (Harold Ramis) and starts looking into his past for answers, while much of the film plays out in flashback, recounting his bittersweet teen years, when everything was ahead of him but his own goals and motivations were elusive. What makes the film watchable is the complexity of the central relationship, as the mature Billy realizes that the most important woman in his life arrived when he was too young to appreciate her. \n\nThe movie is quite beautiful to look at with its clean-scrubbed view of small town life and high school sports, and the characters are engaging to follow. This is not a great movie by any means. Like Billy Wyatt himself, this one just misses hitting the major leagues, but it IS enjoyable in a low key way, and the lack of interesting movies on this potentially interesting subject makes it a bit special.",

      "reviewBody": "TCM aired this Christmas Eve this past year. I can&apos;t believe so few people have seen this judging by the 20+ reviews and 500 votes. It is an undiscovered gem waiting to be found. Hopefully with more airings around the holiday it will build a much deserved following.\n\nThis is such a charming film with two superlative stars - Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. While they both play roles they easily inhabit - her as the tough broad and him as the good-as-gold good guy - they both bring such warmth, charm and ease into their portrayals as to seem like a warm pair of gloves on a cold&apos;s winter night.\n\nI love the references to Indiana. Both of my parents were Hoosiers and we went back to visit many times for reunions and Christmases. So much of the film seemed like a visit home to me. &quot;Back Home In Indiana&quot; is such a great melody, as was &quot;A Perfect Day&quot;. Wouldn&apos;t it be great if families still gathered &apos;round pianos for a sing-a-long? MacMurray&apos;s farmhouse was such a wonderfully authentic set. \n\nWouldn&apos;t all of us love to be welcomed into a home like this, with so much love and warmth. There are so many nice old-fashioned touches, like popping corn over the fire, stringing popcorn for the Christmas tree, making popovers, a church bazaar, and a New Year&apos;s Eve Barn Dance. There is a wonderful touching scene when the spinster Aunt is letting Stanwyck borrow a gown of hers - only to find out it was a wedding dress she never got to use. I had to laugh at all the undergarments that went along with it (corset, bust lace, hip lace, etc, all to make a woman appear curvier). At one point she asks Stanwyck the size of her waist, which she answers is a 25 or 26. The Aunt says when she was young, they thought 19 inches was big. Ouch, those corsets must have hurt!\n\nThere are many different moods to this film which made it so interesting. At times, it felt like a screwball comedy, then a noir-ish piece, there&apos;s drama, and there&apos;s romance. I think this is a film the whole family can watch as it will appeal to most everyone. This one will have you laughing and tearing up at sentimental moments. A true classic that should be more appreciated today.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an awesome spaghetti western that deserves more recognition from fans of the genre.\n\nThe story is a classic tale of revenge. The &quot;Hero&quot; is a villain himself, in true spaghetti fashion. He is wronged to such a severe and violent degree that one can&apos;t help cheering him on as he brutally hunts down and kills the men who betray him and leave him for dead. There isn&apos;t a single boring moment in this movie.\n\nThe acting from all the cast members is above average for a Eurowestern. I especially like Robert Woods&apos;s maniacal laughing as he torments the victims of his vengeance. It&apos;s a nice touch- definitely the kind of thing that makes these Eurowesterns so fun to watch.\n\nLallo Gori&apos;s music score is fantastic. It has a style all its own, and manages to sound great without trying to imitate Morricone. The organ music parts are especially cool.\n\nThere is even a little touch of Poe at the end, as the buildings begin to crumble around the tragic characters.\n\nI really can&apos;t say enough about this movie without giving too much away, so see it for yourself if you can find it!",

Just couple of hours of stylish cinematic shots (obviously Amal Neerad) of dudes running around shooting at each other sauteed with saucy humor and not-that-bad BGM. And that climax shows the humanity after all we all are just mortals swimming in this fish ball, doing all sorts of crazy things to each other, in the end we all embrace that sweet sweet relief with a raging party before the good sleep. There are no foes at the party, only friends. Party on fellow mortal, do not go gentle into that good night.",

After failing to cut a deal with the mob over the dealings of the diamonds he smuggled, he&apos;s stopped in a dark alley by a dangerous hit-man (played by Leslie himself), who tells him his life will be turned upside down and he won&apos;t even be able to rob a gas station. Up until this point, &quot;Dog Walker&quot; appears to be a straightforward narrative; this is about to change. If I do have issue with &quot;Dog Walker&quot;, it is that very little of it makes sense, although that all changes in the end when true motivations are revealed and everything wraps itself up quite neatly. This is a very noirish mood piece, funded by Leslie using his own money, shot on film, and featuring many of the greatest actors of the business, plus the jazzy blues score that became Leslie&apos;s trademark. Highly recommended for any fans of the adult film industry, Leslie, or film in general. 10/10",

There were only a few good laughs. A lot of scenes that were presumably meant to be funny didn&apos;t really work even for this propitious audience. \n\nThe characters of this movie were all pictured rather one-dimensional and I didn&apos;t really feel for any of them. With 130 minutes runtime this movie was at least 30 minutes too long and I was kind of bored at the end. \n\nThe two previous efforts of Peter Thorwarth (&quot;Bang, Boom, Bang&quot; and &quot;Was nicht passt wird passend gemacht&quot;) were much more enjoyable for me. So I recommend to rather watch these and to skip &quot;Goldene Zeiten&quot;.",

Hangal, Asrani and Late Utpal Dutt.\n\nKusum disregards her family&apos;s efforts to get her married as she is obsessed with the actor, Dharmendra. Tired of her antics, her uncle contacts the actor to show her the realities of life.\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee fondly known as Hrishi Da was known for making family oriented films which a middle class can relate to themselves and Guddi is one such film in which a teenager girl gets attracted and infatuated towards and actor after seeing larger than life cinema industry and after spending some time in between the film making process and watching the shoot she gradually realizes the pros and cons of this industry and gets disenchanted.\n\nHrishi Da deserves an applause in making such a realistic film without showing anything larger than life and it gives a feel that everything is happening in front of you and you&apos;ll feel yourself as the part of the film.\n\nActing in the film is good and Jaya Bachchan nails her role with perfection. Utpal Dutt never disappoints and have to say that he proves that he was one of the main pillar of the film. Dharmendra was superb and it was hard to describe if he was acting or he was in his natural state. Sumit Bhanja, Sumita Sanyal and A. K Aangal were also impressive. Asrani leaves a mark in his limited screen appreance.\n\nScreenplay of the film is superb and will keep you hooked. Songs were melodious and ending could&apos;ve been little more stretched but still the film never disappoints.\n\nIf you are looking for a family oriented realistic film than this is the film for you. A Must watch.",

But this suffers two major problems. The first is the length of this movie. At almost 2 hours, it is way too long. There is no reason for a 2 hour Conan movie. It feels stretched out, and too slow in many parts of the movie. Too much of the story is a meandering mess.\n\nThe second is the comparison between Jason Mamoa and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Jason is no Schwarzenegger. He has half the charm and half the presence. I still like Jason Mamoa, but he&apos;s no Arnold.\n\nI do appreciate the attempt. They try their best with a big scale production. The stunts are good. The battles gets pretty big. Stephen Lang is a good bad guy. And Rose McGowan is great as the creepy weird Marique. If only they scale back the running time to a more manageable length. This could have been just good enough to recommend.",

Maybe I should&apos;ve, because the first two parts of Halo Legends proved very interesting, and made me appreciate the universe and backstory of this series a great deal more.\n\nAfter that, the remaining five shorts are a bit of a mixed bag, as is to be expected from an anthology film, but I generally found more good here than bad. The most memorable of the bunch, beyond Origins, is probably the wacky very anime-esque episode following Spartan 1337. That one was actually pretty funny, though I can imagine it annoying series diehards, because it kind of makes fun of the Halo series in general.\n\nHalo Legends fluctuated between the most and least seriously I&apos;ve ever taken a piece of Halo media, and for that, I have to hold a weird amount of respect for it.",

      "reviewBody": "Connie (Ricki Lake) lost her mother at twelve in Hoboken, New Jersey. Because she did not get along with her father, Connie left NJ at 18 and went to NYC. Unfortunately, she immediately hooked up with a low-life named Steve and became pregnant. Steve was less than thrilled with the news and threw Connie out of the house. Although she works as a waitress for awhile, when her delivery date draws near, she finds herself broke and homeless. The next day , Connie boards a train she thinks is the subway but which turns out to be a railway to Boston. There, she is befriended by handsome, rich Hugh and his new and very pregnant wife Patricia. The train derails. Hugh and Patricia are killed. But, by a twist of fate, Connie is mistaken for Patricia and finds herself and her new baby in a private hospital, as befitting the wife of a member of the rich Winterbourne family. She meets her new mother-in-law (Shirley MacLaine) and her &quot;husband&apos;s&quot; twin brother, Bill (Brendan Fraser) and goes home to a posh, Boston mansion, complete with servants. Just how long will she be able to fool everyone into thinking she really is a part of the family? This is a nice little film for the proverbial romcom fan. MacLaine is wonderful as the matriarch of the wealthy family and Fraser is his usual handsome, quirky, affable self. Lake seems a bit miscast as the girl with a big secret but fulfills her role adequately. The sets, costumes, and production values are very high. Do you love improbable plots and unexpected, humorous romance? Make a date to see Mrs. W. and you will be in your element, absolutely.",

      "reviewBody": "With Mani Rathnam and A R Rehman linked to a project, one cannot be in to much doubt that if nothing else the music is going to be mind blowing.\n\n But that was not the case with Saathiya. It not only had mind-blowing music and score it was one of the best movies of 2002. \n\nThe music and the respective picturisations are excellent, especially in the case of the title song Saathiya&apos;. My other favorite song is the tongue in cheek song Choori  pe Choori&apos;. However all the other songs are very pleasurable as well. The main question was how would first time director Shaad Ali perform on this story, that would be a remake of Mani Rathnam South-Indian movie be as good as the original?  Would he produce an art movie piece as his father (Muzaffar Ali) has done with movies like Umrao Jaan, or would he deliver a commercial piece? What one can be sure of is that Shaad has taken the craftsman of his fathers art movies and put them to commercial use, and delivered a movie that is unique, professional, modern and outstanding.\n\nThe acting is excellent as is the story line. Having liked Rani from Ghulam to K3G, is wonderful to see her finally taking the lead in a role that does her justice. Her realistic portrayal of Suhani, a modern genre women dealing with the trials and tribulations of married life is excellent. Having not seen anything of Viveks before, is was a surprise to see an actor of his young caliber holding such presence on screen, that it overshadowed SRK. It is evident that this actor will reach high strides in his coming career.\n\n For a change this movie actually delivers a subconscious message, something not commonly done in bollywood movies. The message is lifes to short, tell those around you how much they really mean to you&apos;.  Taking this to heart, I can truly say that I loved Saathiya."

The film makers were able to take actual clips of Alfred Hitchcock from his movies, movie promos, his &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; introductions and archival footage and create an odd documentary-like film about the Cold War and a doppleganger for Hitchcock. I was concerned, however, as the idea of taking famous dead folks and putting them into your film without their permission brings up a HUGE ethical and legal question. I have no idea whether or not they obtained permission from his daughter--I sure hope they did. But even then, it seems wrong. However, putting this debate aside, what did I think of the film? Well, frankly, after the initial interest wore off, I found all the clips very disjoint and the film a bit dull....no, very dull. Plus, why, exactly, did they choose to use Hitchcock other than they had a great impersonator and the clips?! An interesting experiment but a film that I think would satisfy only a very small group of film viewers. I would prefer to see the original clips strung together--as Hitchcock&apos;s movie promos and other appearances were often brilliantly funny.",

My friends talked me into seeing this (instead of a good movie), promising to each pay me the cost of admission if it turned out to be as awful as we had been warned. &quot;Oh, the critics are never right,&quot; they said. Yes, the critics are right about this film, and at least I won the bet, but it was a painful way to earn 50 bucks. \n\nLawrence just makes a fool out of himself. The premise is worthless to begin with: frantic dad sticks his nose in his daughter&apos;s business as she begins her college career. There is no humor in that. Somehow, it gets worse. The writing is abysmal; of note are the endless babbling speeches by Lawrence, pre-school intelligence level gags, stereotypical characterizations that went out with the dinosaurs, and horribly executed slapstick scenes. The direction is zero: it just poses Lawrence in your face like he&apos;s doing a stand-up routine, while other nameless characters do a lousy job of trying to pretend they think he&apos;s funny. The amateurish cast&apos;s irritating over-acting makes this cinematic flop even more torturous. \n\nThe audience, like the daughter character in the film, will want to escape from Lawrence&apos;s manic ramblings as quickly as possible. Expect this one to have a very short general-release lifetime before it gets shelved in the 99 cent video grocery store bin, and mercifully forgotten.",

      "reviewBody": "How far are you willing to go?  How deep can you go into the world of pro-wrestling, and the life of pro-wrestler Bret &quot;The Hitman&quot; Hart?  This is it!  This film will take on a journey closer to the life of Bret Hart, and closer to the life of a pro-wrestler.  Wrestling is fake, yes.  But what&apos;s it like behind the stage, where the stories are created, and the matches are planned?  And what transpired during the time in which Vince McMahon planned his betrayal of Bret Hart?  You won&apos;t see anything quite like this for a long time!  &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot; documents Bret&apos;s life from his childhood to his relationship with his father, his family, and his relationship with Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation.  It&apos;s never boring, and me, being a former pro-wrestling fan, I came to appreciate what tasks the wrestlers had to undertake.  I also strongly agree with a lot of what Bret says in the film, that pro-wrestling has become bloodier, raunchier, and more inappropriate for children than anything, simply for the sake of ratings.  You come to feel sympathy for Bret, knowing the hardships a pro-wrestling really does have to deal with.  It&apos;s also tragic to know that soon after this film was made, his brother Owen Hart was killed in a stunt at the WWF.  Vince McMahon has indeed, gone too far for the sake of beating Ted Turner&apos;s WCW ratings.  I highly recommend this film for someone who likes pro-wrestling and wrestler Bret Hart.  If you don&apos;t like wrestling, this film will make you come to feel respect for the man, and the people involved in the wrestling business"

A pleasant counterpoint to &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;- yes, admittedly much more of a striving to be cheerful/optimistic bit of propaganda than &quot;Best Years&quot;, but similar in tone nonetheless. I also recommend this film for the intriguing casting of Robert Walker (best known as psychopath Bruno Antony in Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;) as Jennifer Jones&apos; somewhat wishy washy yet ultimately tragic boyfriend- the infamous scene where Jones tearfully bids him farewell as his battlefield destined train departs is classic. Genuinely emotional. Not one of the all time best movies I have ever seen, but certainly worth a watch. Probably of interest to Shirley Temple fans, too, as it is one of her &apos;young adult&apos; roles."

      "reviewBody": "The film evolves around Max Manus as one of the central heroes of the young Norwegian resistance during the World War II. Together with Gunnar Kjakan Sønsteby, Gregers Gram and the other brave youngsters not willing to see the free Norway become a part of the German Nazi empire The Third Reich.\n\nAfter the fun flick &quot;Bandidas&quot; no one expected Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg to be able to do such a correct and true told story of one the Norwegian resistance heroes. But they have managed to make a great film, without messing up in any way.\n\nWe get the feeling that the heroism was not just a one-sided thing. For every action the resistance made, more civilians had to die. Max Manus, brilliantly played by Aksel Hennie, was an adventurer, and very lucky to be one of the survivors, more than once thanks to the cold-minded Gunnar Kjakan Sønsteby, warning him about the reality of it all.\n\nThe film also shows the psychological effects on the adventurer, who got to be a heavy drinker during the war, and after. Being a hero is just a part of the whole story.\n\nA strong part of this film is the human relations. The boyish ways and friendships. The love-story is beautifully made. One can really relate to the persons. That&apos;s good acting as well! Some find Fehmers girlfriend as unnecessary. I don&apos;t agree. This is to show that the Nazis had both charm and feelings too. This gives balance as well. \n\nSome have been criticizing the Norwegian resistance for being young silly adventurers. Some of this might be a little bit true, but what they did, and what the sacrificed, is impressive. Most of us would not even think of trying, or dare, to do anything as to stop an invasion of a big and threatening force. Thank God for the likes of Max Manus. He never stopped believing that the Germans could be beaten, even though he was far down after losing his friends one by one in the battle for freedom.\n\nA solid mark is given for true storytelling of brave young spirits, making Norway what the country is today.",

      "name": "Character First, What A Novel Concept",
      "reviewBody": "In some sideways alternate universe I&apos;d like to believe Mike Judge is a Judd Apatow or an Edgar Wright, which is to say a modern comedy director whose upcoming projects are actually followed with any degree of anticipation. Of his two previous live-action films, &quot;Office Space,&quot; for its flaws, has a special place in my heart and I appreciated &quot;Idiocracy&quot; more than most. So along comes &quot;Extract,&quot; a subtle, straightforward comedy about the little things in life. You know, inane neighbors, workplace politics, sexual frustration, male gigolos, and horse tranquilizers.\n\nOkay, maybe it&apos;s not all that subtle, but &quot;Extract&quot; is less boisterous than Judge&apos;s previous films while retaining their biting, sardonic banter and oddly believable caricatures. Probably the reason the director&apos;s work hasn&apos;t caught on with mainstream audiences is that their stories and characters are always paramount to their gag writing, which in turn gives them a comparatively low joke-per-minute ratio.\n\nThe plot itself isn&apos;t as interesting or ambitious as &quot;Office Space&quot; or &quot;Idiocracy&quot; respectively, but the terrific casting and low-key performances keep &quot;Extract&quot; charming even when its story falters. Particular scenes and sequences sag around the middle of the film, and the plot lines never dovetail as well as they probably could, but the narrative, while simple, is strong enough to shield the film from ever becoming an outright bore. \n\nJudge&apos;s respect for his storytelling transcends the temptation to pack the film with gimmicky gags or disposable pop culture references, which is refreshing in comparison to the blisteringly unfunny and now highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time, sequel green-lit, &quot;The Hangover.&quot; Jason Bateman of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; fame returns as another corporate mogul, though of considerably less affluence than Michael Bluth, and the role, unsurprisingly, fits like a glove. It&apos;s not exactly a retread for the actor either, who exhibits an empathetic vulnerability that hasn&apos;t existed in his previous roles.\n\n&quot;Extract&apos;s&quot; Joel Reynolds is an interesting antithesis to Michael Bluth in that he offers a completely opposite take on the pragmatic modern businessman. Michael is a man who assumes his hardest work has yet to come, where Joel considers his dues paid, and at the outset of the film, is looking to sell his plant and embrace an early retirement. Joel is indicative of Mike Judge&apos;s greater analysis of the American working class, and reminiscent also, though not in a derivative sense, of Peter, the protagonist of &quot;Office Space,&quot; in that both characters long for a life outside of the workplace. Michael Bluth wants to work; Mike Judge&apos;s characters have to work.\n\nThe rest of the cast, including Mila Kunis as a con-woman catalyst, J.K. Simmons as name- challenged manager, and Ben Affleck as a worldly hipster doofus, all perform admirably. &quot;Extract&quot; is its cast, and there isn&apos;t a bad performance in the bunch.\n\nJudge&apos;s latest is a film that really needs to be taken on its own merits. It&apos;s a warm, entertaining if unambitious film that may not be as funny as some expect, but is never unfunny, if that makes any sense. \n\nIf you&apos;re not laughing, it&apos;s because the film isn&apos;t trying to make you laugh, which is almost a foreign concept in modern comedy and sure to leave some audiences cold. That being said, there isn&apos;t much reason to rush out and see the film either. If you&apos;re interested in something (somewhat) more mature when &quot;The Hangover 2&quot; hits theaters, &quot;Extract&quot; will make a pretty good rental.",

Liked the account of actor Alan Alda&apos;s telling of his dad-Robert Alda&apos;s-experience as a singer and straight man there. Also was touched with Chris Costello-daughter of Lou Costello-and her account of her dad&apos;s tragedy of having his infant son drowning while he was supposed to do his radio show which he did despite that happening especially when they showed the baby&apos;s picture. And then there&apos;s the audio of one Blaze Starr-the woman who was once involved with my state&apos;s (Louisiana) governor Earl Long-who died last June. The interviews seem to have a haphazard quality as it goes from one tangent to another. Still, Ms. Zemeckis has nothing to be ashamed about in covering this long-neglected subject of this part of the entertainment world from days gone by being recorded now. So on that note, Behind the Burly Q is highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "DASTAN (1950) could have been a truly haunting classic had its director Abdur Rashid Kardar approached it with the fatalistic style of his brother-in-law Mehboob Khan; fyi, Kardar&apos;s wife, Hindi film actress Bahar Akhtar, was the elder sister of Mehboob Khan&apos;s 2nd wife Sardar Akhtar (the original &quot;Mother India&quot; in Mehboob&apos;s AURAT-1940). This film is a Hindi remake of the 1948 Hollywood film ENCHANTMENT starring David Niven, Teresa Wright, and Jayne Meadows. Comparing the two films, DASTAN is actually the slightly better of the two films. However, DASTAN was designated to spotlight the legendary Hindi film heroine Suraiya; she sang her own songs ! In spite of this almost prodigious talent for a screen heroine, Suraiya is overshadowed by the overwhelmingly stunning screen presence of Veena (a Hindi film star in her own right). Veena (born Tajour Sultana in Quetta, Balochistan) was the most beautiful actress in the history of Hindi cinema, second to none. Veena was a screen siren like no other in that her bewitching looks combined with her powerful voice and modulated style of delivering dialogues made her leading men come across as boys. And this film is no exception...Even with big name heroes of that era: Raj Kapoor, Suresh (real name Nasim Ahmad), and Al Nasir (Veena&apos;s real life husband). A real oddity of casting has Al Nasir playing his wife&apos;s &quot;brother&quot; in this film; in Indian culture especially of that era, this would have raised some eyebrows. When Suraiya&apos;s character &apos;Indira&apos; has her climactic scene in which she stands up to Veena&apos;s &apos;Rani&apos;, Veena owns the scene just by the glare in her eyes. Veena was too powerful a screen presence for any of her co-stars throughout her 40 plus year acting career. This film is highly recommended in it&apos;s own right, but a must see to behold the Hindi screen siren Veena. DASTAN was the 3rd highest grossing film of 1950 earning over Rs. 65 Lakhs, just behind SAMADHI (Rs. 75 Lakhs) and BABUL (Rs. 70 Lakhs); in the year 1950, 65-75 Lakh rupees would be like Rs. 650-750 Crores in 2015. Photographs of Veena available via the internet do NOT do her justice. Viewers would have to see her films in good quality prints to grasp Veena&apos;s beauty. DASTAN is one of them...While AFSANA (1951) co-starring Ashok Kumar &amp; Pran, NAJMA (1943) co-starring Ashok Kumar &amp; Yakub, and HUMAYUN (1945) co-starring Ashok Kumar &amp; Nargis are notably some others; in this latter film, Veena&apos;s character portrayal summed up her entire screen persona: She was hard enough to kill you and soft enough to disarm you...",

Not only Kurosawa&apos;s most well known film, but the most widely recognized Japanese film ever made. This movie will forever be known as a milestone in motion picture history.\n\nThe story revolves around a village that has become a group of bandits&apos; common looting and pillaging ground. The villagers cannot take this any longer and go to town to hire warriors to defend the village from the bandits. A wandering ronin, Kambei (Takashi Shimura) agrees to help them and with his help, they recruit six others that agree to take the job. The seven samurai teach the villagers how to stand up to the bandits and defend themselves. Finally, when the time comes, they engage in a fierce battle with the attacking bandits.\n\nAbout once in every 20 years or so we are gifted with a film that has the meaning, power, richness, and technique that The Seven Samurai has. I cannot urge anyone enough to see this film, the images are true cinematic poetry rich with so much emotion that I cannot even describe them in words. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa&apos;s works, then please see Seven Samurai... you will witness the true beauty, excellence and magic that the art form known as film is capable of.",

The massacree of the forest of Quebec&apos;s north is the subject of this film, but it goes beyond that : it&apos;s\n\nthat political blindness, sold to the big money makers that&apos;s in cause. I&apos;m not really an ecologist, but I was angry when I saw some of the images of the film, and hear what Desjardins had to say about these politicians and big money makers (most of them Americans). Who runs this planet? 40 guys who had all the money? Killing the forest that way it&apos;s just horrible! So that&apos;s why I think everybody should see this film. You&apos;ll be angry too and that&apos;s really rare that a documentary movie goes to that point (Roger &amp; me did that, but not as far as this one). Director Richard Desjardins is a poet and singer, and it&apos;s also rare that a man of words, a true artist, takes risks for that kind of issues.",

Yet he is too shy and fears rejection for the person he is, hence he comes up with a plan with unexpected results.\n\n&quot;Eating Out All You Can Eat&quot; is very entertaining! The story is positive, though there are many clichés but they are not overdone. Acting is good, especially by Rebekah Kochan who plays the character Tiffani. The jokes are funny without being rude, which is refreshing. I find the ending very heartwarming and touching, as a very pleasing ending is seen. There is an extra scene at the end after the credits, make sure you stay behind for it!"

      "reviewBody": "There was real potential for &apos;The Forsyte Saga&apos; to be a good film. The casting did sound odd but with performances this talented there was a chance that they could have pulled it off. It was from a studio with so many classics under its belt. It looked incredibly handsome seeing its advertising and stills. The source material is absolutely brilliant, though did worry that because it is so rich it would not lend itself well to merely a feature length film.\n\nWhich were my feelings exactly when getting round to seeing &apos;The Forsyte Saga&apos;. It is watchable and has a number of obvious good things, but with more consistent pacing and more suitable casting it could have been a winner but turned out to be instead an interesting and noble disappointment. Proof too that when it comes to adapting the source material for feature length it is best leaving it alone, and the vastly superior television series from the 60s showed that it works much better adapted as a serial/mini-series.\n\nGood things are quite a few. It is a very handsomely mounted film, especially the quite exquisite photography and the costumes won an Oscar for good reason. The other best thing is Errol Flynn, this was courageous casting for a role he on paper sounded wrong for and would have been quite different for him. He however was one of the few actors that came off well, showing that he can do dramatic and less sympathetic roles and does so in an admirably restrained way. Walter Pidgeon is also charming.\n\nBronislau Kaper&apos;s score is lush and induces a lot of emotions. The main theme is one that is not easy to forget. Greer Garson has some affecting moments.\n\nShe also doesn&apos;t always look comfortable or like her heart was properly in it, Eleanor Parker would have been a better choice. Janet Leigh does her best and brings some charm but her role is practically a plot device and has nothing to it. Worst of it is a too old and far too cold Robert Young, who has no charm or likeability. The characters seemed underdeveloped, with the one exception being Soames. The direction seemed rather pedestrian.\n\nMuch of the script was very stilted and rambled. The film did need a longer length and more of the story elaborated upon and taking longer to unfold. There was no substance to the storytelling either, to me there was very little tension and emotion and it all feels undernourished. A tighter pace was also in order and there are similarly scenes that drag as a result of padding out material that works a lot better in mini-series format.\n\nOn the whole, watchable but there was a potentially good film in there somewhere that doesn&apos;t materialise. 5/10",

Mainly about teen hood Caine (Tyrin Turner) and his life with fellow South Central L.A. pal O-Dog (Larenz Tate), among other events of that time, I found the whole thing a little upsetting with what I&apos;ve now found out had the most use of the f-word of any of these black movies I&apos;ve been watching these last few days, not to mention the constant violence. Still, it does get better when Caine&apos;s possible girlfriend Ronnie (Jada Pinkett before becoming Mrs. Will Smith) offers a possible out by moving out with her and her son Anthony (Jullian Roy Doster) to Atlanta. But then another girl he fooled around with named Ilena (Erin Leshawn Wiley) tells him she&apos;s pregnant and...oh, watch the film if you want to know. In summary, Menace II Society didn&apos;t really pick my interest until the last 30 minutes and I started to see it in a whole new light. So on that note, I highly recommend it with reservations.",

      "reviewBody": "In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: \n\n***** To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. I think in many ways &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe &quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;.\n\nWhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.\n\nThis movie still packs a wallop and I&apos;m very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****\n\nI&apos;m very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It&apos;s a Wonderful Life, arguably, The Best Years of Our Lives&apos; Oscar wins, including Best Picture, were very well-deserved. \n\nI&apos;ve just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.",

      "reviewBody": "The demonisation of director Veit Harlan resulting from his notorious film &apos;Jud Suss&apos; has been well documented. A year earlier he made &apos;The Immortal Heart&apos; which although not one of his greatest has touches of the master film-maker that he undoubdtedly was. It is a biopic covering the final years in the life of Peter Henlein, inventor of the world&apos;s first pocket watch and based upon the play &apos;The Nuremburg Egg&apos; by Veit&apos;s father Walter. Henlein is played by one of the greatest actors of all time, Heinrich George and playing his wife Ev is Kristina Soederbaum both of whom were to appear in &apos;Jud Suss&apos;. Ev is much younger than Peter and one cannot help but sympathise with her as she lies in bed each night hoping for some &apos;tender loving care&apos; whilst he is downstairs slaving over his invention. Bearing in mind that he has a wonky heart it is likely that had he fulfilled his marital duties he would not have lived long enough to invent the watch! Unsurprisingly they part but are reunited just before he expires. Their scenes together are excellent as his single mindedness is in contrast to her strong emotions. Ironically Kristina plays the inventor&apos;s third wife whilst also being the third wife of the director! Excellent support also from Paul Wegener as Henlein&apos;s doctor. There is a great sense of time and place here as we really feel we are in 16th Century Nuremburg. Despite an indifferent print one can still appreciate Bruno Mondi&apos;s work as lighting cameraman. One of the most striking features is the inspired use of the music of J. S. Bach especially in the opening and closing sequences. Far from being a classic this piece has a great deal to recommend it and like all of Harlan&apos;s films, including &apos;Jud Suss&apos;(!) is worthy of consideration.",

The real main character is the big dog, Buck, and his transformation from house pet to sled dog to alpha male of his own hybrid Timberwolf pack.\n\nThis movie in its form could not have been made with real dogs. Instead they used state of the art motion capture to generate realistic animation for the animals. This is covered quite nicely in a series of &quot;making of&quot; extras on the movie disc.\n\nHarrison Ford, almost 80 now, is very effective as the narrator and the old prospector that befriends Buck. This is a really good movie, at first the sight of an animated Buck threw me off but soon it made no difference, the story is so good.\n\nI watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie."

It´s hard to completely dislike an attempt at a full-blooded Danish supernatural horror movie, but the result is a bit too loose and even amateurish at times, but Gonzalez earns an A for effort and is a talent to watch out for. Definite cult possibilities, though.",

      "reviewBody": "It was an interesting enough idea, I suppose, to set a series of Sherlock Holmes films in the &quot;modern day&quot;...at the time, the WWII era...but those who are familiar with the first two Rathbone/Bruce films might be thrown off by it. When the rights passed from Fox to Universal, the two stars were retained, but apparently our two heroes stepped through a hole in the space-time continuum. The Fox films were Victorian period pieces, whereas Universal took the opportunity to utilize Sherlock Holmes in the series of modern-day B-movies into which this entry falls, several of which were fairly standard wartime propaganda...pretty much the order of the day for Hollywood films circa 1942-1945.\n\nWhile the film may boast some entertainment value, the plot is actually quite silly. Sherlock Holmes (sporting a remarkably bad haircut) has been charged with the task of guarding Dr. Franz Tobel, the inventor of a bomb sight (which, when you see it, will give you an idea of what the film&apos;s budget was) that will apparently revolutionize airborne warfare. Holmes&apos;s task is to keep Tobel safe (at which he fails) and to keep the bomb sight out of the hands of the Nazis. When Tobel is abducted, Holmes must unravel a coded message before his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty does. Though the credits state that the film is an adaptation of Conan Doyle&apos;s story, The Dancing Men, only the code itself is taken from said story. And a small reference to another story, The Empty House, also shows up early in the film. Apart from that, you&apos;ll find no Conan Doyle here.\n\nInterestingly enough, what makes Tobel&apos;s bomb sight so remarkable, apart from the fact that the bombs seem to land where they&apos;re supposed to, is never expounded upon...leaving the viewer to assume that both Allied and German bomb sights were abysmally inaccurate, as both sides are clamoring to get their hands on one that actually works. Probably not the best way to bolster confidence in the Allied fighting machine...but then, logic is scarce in this outing. Holmes relies just as heavily upon chance and educated guesses as he does upon deduction, and it&apos;s the bumbling Watson (who was never bumbling in the original stories) who inadvertently provides the solution to the major stumbling block (despite the fact that the solution should have been obvious to someone as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes).\n\nAll in all, this film has its moments, but fails to live up to the legend of the world&apos;s greatest detective. Rathbone is a fine Holmes and Bruce (despite the almost unforgivable dumbing down of the Watson character) does a good job, as well. But much of the supporting cast seem to be phoning in their performances. The production values are rather noticeably low and the script is fairly ludicrous. I still watch this one from time to time, and certainly prefer it over Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (the first Universal Holmes entry)...but I can&apos;t help but think that Sherlock Holmes deserves better than this.\n\nInteresting sidenote - This film contains the series&apos; one and only reference to Sherlock Holmes&apos;s hypodermic cocaine usage. As Holmes is describing to Moriarty an elaborate hypothetical death scenario involving an intravenous needle, Moriarty interjects &quot;The needle to the last...eh, Holmes?&quot; How this managed to slip by the censors at the Breen Office (which, at the time, strictly forbade such references) is perhaps the one great mystery to be found in this film.",

However,   the poor English dubbing make  his performance hard to judge."

      "name": "An entertaining Indian crime thriller from the 80s with some strong female performances",
      "reviewBody": "The 80s in India were famous for producing the worst commercial films but here is an exception. Not that Sippy&apos;s &apos;Satyamev Jayate&apos; is a masterpiece of any sort, it&apos;s simply an entertaining and engaging crime drama about corruption, lust, betrayal, abandonment and revenge. Though the ending is predictable, the situations leading towards are engaging and we meet some interesting characters. For an 80&apos;s film, it&apos;s reasonably well shot.\n\nThe characters of the &apos;good&apos; guys are well written as we see shades of gray. However, the &apos;bad&apos; guys appear to be slightly one dimensional but the writer does explain reasons behind some of the character&apos;s attitude. For example, we can understand why Anupam Kher&apos;s greedy character is such a jerk to his wife.\n\nVinod Khanna is mostly alright as the alcoholic cop but he fails to convince in the drunken scenes. Asrani provides some comic relief. Shakti Kapoor&apos;s Bagha is menacing and Anupam Kher is OK as the jackass lawyer husband. However, in spite of being a male-dominated film, &apos;Satyamev Jayate&apos; belongs to the women. Anita Raj is brilliant as Arjun&apos;s former lover Vidya while both Madhavi (as Pooja) and Meenakshi Sheshadri (as Seema) steal the show with their heartbreaking performances. Two scenes I found very disturbing were Seema&apos;s gang rape and Bagha forcing Pooja to clean the table. It is Pooja and Seema, with whom that the viewers ends up sympathizing most.\n\nBappi Lahiri&apos;s music is very pleasant. Only two songs are fully picturised and I like both the songs. &apos;Dil mein ho tum&apos; is a very romantic song sung beautifully by Asha Bhosle and &apos;De Rahi Duwayen&apos; is a sweet song about a brother and a sister.\n\nThere are a few plot holes and situations that should have been better explained. For example, what makes Bagha tap Arjun&apos;s telephone? All in all, if one is trying to dig up some good commercial Hindi film from the 80s, &apos;Satyamev Jayate&apos; may be among the rare few. It&apos;s not a gem but has entertainment value."

Rita Hayworth was an up and comer of about 19 when this was released in 1937. She played her part with real maturity and ability. She had natural beauty even then and is seen wearing shorts as part of a girl&apos;s softball team. Not a big deal but thought I should mention it. Rita is an innocent girl but is involved with a gangster type pretending that he is a businessman. He is waiting with his cronies to make a lucrative deal which is a phony, then split. The two girls are on the same softball team and end up in danger from the gangsters. That&apos;s about all I can say without this being a spoiler. You&apos;ve got the idea. By the way Guinn &quot;Big Boy&quot; Williams is in this as the police lieutenant. This movie was quite a bit better than I had expected and was well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Bond again in an electrifying movie that scored a new hit in the action genre . The immortal agent 007 , whose deadly precision , sourness , irony and irresistible attractive is perfectly portrayed by Roger Moore. This time he investigates the killing one his colleagues who appeared dead with a Russian egg Faberge of incalculable price . He undergoes an incredible adventure with spectacular pursuits until a chilling countdown , leading to a possible nuclear holocaust . This time OO7 taking off an elegant villainnamed Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) living in India, as Bond tries to stop him but the maniacal nasty wreak all sorts of havoc until Bond steps in and the heinous mastermind schemes to put a nuclear bomb at a circus whose owner is Octopussy (Maud Adams ,the only Bond girl who repeated acting , she previously played ¨The man with the golden gun¨) . Nobody does it better...thirteen times. James Bond&apos;s all time action high. Roger Moore. James Bond 007 . Nobody does him better. James Bond&apos;s all time high\n\nThe film contains excitement, emotion , lots of action , suspense , gorgeous women (a beautiful Kristina Wayborn) and extreme nasties (Jourdan , Steven Berkoff , Kabir Bedi) . The plot tosses in every cliché including the obligatory intervention from MonneyPenny (Lois Maxwell), M (Robert Brown) , and Q (Desmond Llewelyn) . Before essaying the role Bond , Roger Moore honed his suavity in the series as ¨The Saint¨, hence he adds a humorous-tongue-in-cheek dimension to Ian Fleming&apos;s famed creation as the connoisseur (women and wine especially) spy hero , starting his role Bond with ¨Live and let die¨. Film displays gimmicks and silly set pieces that usually marred the best Moore outings . In spite of a moving opening sequence and some thrilling scenes along the way the Bond-Moore series is starting to look a little bit tired , just as its main star . John Barry&apos;s music is unforgettable ,as always , and including a colorful cinematography by cameraman Alan Hume. An agreeable screenplay and more believable excitement with cliff-hangers situations come to mind ; still, this solid outing isn&apos;t a bad Bond and it does star the most sympathetic OO7 . This is one of the more watchable entries based on a short book by Fleming with the same title ¨Octopussy¨ and stars Roger Moore in top form as 007 and adding an assured direction by John Glen .",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Diary of a Shinjuku Thief",
      "reviewBody": "I was wondering which of the films will prove to be the one big alternative, experimental experience, and to my surprise it had to be Nagisa Oshima&apos;s Diary of a Shinjuku Thief. As the festival director Gavin Liu had explained in the pre-screening introduction, this is a rare screening of the film, and the owner of Kinokuniya bookstores is actually the man playing the Kinokuniya store manager in the film, as are many of the performers playing themselves, being non-actors going their own real thing as captured on celluloid.\n\nIt&apos;s a treat all right, but I suppose it&apos;s an acquired taste that I still haven&apos;t cultivated. One of the draws to this film is because I&apos;m curious to see how Shinjuku, the hotbed area in Tokyo where ail things youth and underground take place, looked like in the swinging 60s, having been there in two consecutive years already. The film opens with a crazy introduction of a man forced by a group to strip down to his underwear (a rather flimsy one that barely protects his modesty), being accused of stealing some pipes, before the group start to cower when they see his tattoo. Then we&apos;re thrust into the narrative proper that deals with the titular bookstore thief Torio, cheekily nicknamed Birdtop (Tadanori Yokoo), as the camera follows behind him through the extremely packed Kino bookstore - where you can&apos;t help that people around just happen to gaze into the camera – until he gets nabbed by the eagle eyed salesgirl Umeko (Rie Yokoyama) for taking a book out without paying for it.\n\nIn fact he does so twice, and besides to experience the high from pinching things, a challenge he throws to Umeko later on in the story, I suspect he does so because he&apos;s got quite the hots for Umeko, an attractive though complicated lady, that even the store manager probably sensed something brewing between them, and offering not to report Birdtop to the cops, but to gift him some books as well as cash for both Birdtop and Umeko to spend. That essentially launches them into having some time off if you will to visit everything else that Oshima&apos;s intended to put into his film, with 4 different writers that will inevitably lead to a kaleidoscope of ideas, bringing forth the massive melting pot of different folks with different strokes.\n\nPresented in sections split by intertitles that tell the time (worldwide to local, and other nuggets of trivia such as the weather condition at the time) the film is almost documentary in nature come this point, and interchanges between black and white and colour which I still have to figure out why, other than to not miss out in capturing the vibrant colours present in particular performances and scenes. There&apos;s a visit to a sexologist whose area of research may challenge Kinsey&apos;s, and a talking heads styled interview with a group that&apos;s focused predominantly on sex, where it gets expressed verbally, and later on, having numerous sex scenes which had to justify its R21 rating in Singapore.\n\nLike the earlier films, this one is also rich in music such as Juro Kara coming on at every opportunity with a guitar, though the tunes were not quite up my alley. It&apos;s like a musical of sorts at times when characters inexplicably appears and break out into music. And while the story becomes more perplexing, I gave up trying to piece the narrative together since it was clearly abandoned to showcase various performances available at that era in Shinjuku. In that respect this film will work relatively well in capturing things that will inevitably be lost as time goes by, and for the modern audience to experience what it was like then, especially those vaudeville theatre styled acts. The other scene I thought I enjoyed until it proved to be outstaying its welcome involved Umeko walking by shelves of books, and quotes from the literary masters call out to her through voiceovers.\n\nThe film ends with a montage of scenes involving some protests with the police out in force. I suppose this would have echoed the feelings of those who did not agree with the film, some having to walk out before they get to the scene. A rare treat, but one that calls for an acquired taste to thoroughly enjoy.",

Along with such disturbing films as &apos;Ichi the Killer&apos; or action films like &apos;City of Lost Souls&apos;, he produces touching stories like &apos;The Bird People of China&apos; or &apos;Guys From Paradise&apos;. The first hour and a bit takes place in a prison, where businessman Kohei Hayakawa (Koji Kikkawa, who was also in Miike&apos;s City of Lost Souls) gets thrown into prison for possession of heroin and quickly finds that without money and bribes there&apos;s no hope of escaping. Whether he&apos;s guilty is not the question, rather how much money he&apos;s willing to give to the corrupt warden, and judge, and lawyer, etc.. He gets thrown into a jail cell with three other Japanese men and when they find out he&apos;s in for heroin possession he is instantly their best friend. The base of the story is betrayal, and how when things are going right it seems like you can trust everybody, but as soon as you wind up in prison all of those connections forget about you, or do something to betray your trust. It&apos;s this common understanding that unites the Japanese men in prison, and they hold their end through some very thick trouble. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s Miike&apos;s best work, but it is definitely a solid film, and proves he is capable of much more than shock cinema. Rating: 25/40",

      "reviewBody": "I was too young to have known anything about this game when it was played in real life, but it was definitely more than a game. It concerned world politics and the cold war. The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don&apos;t know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don&apos;t miss this one."

      "reviewBody": "Read through all the reviews of this movie. Big fan of the first two myself and just got back from watching this. Pretty surprised that nobody has articulated the real reasons why this movie doesn&apos;t work.\n\nFirstly, if you didn&apos;t enjoy the first or second movie all of this probably won&apos;t be very relevant. I would have thought that most people watching the third would have likely seen and enjoyed the other films in the series.\n\nSo, why is this the weakest film in the series? Anybody&apos;s review who criticises it based on a unrealistic plot or implausible action is missing the point. This might be obvious but there are numerous reviews citing these as the reasons for the film being average/bad. It&apos;s also an important part of the formula that worked well in the first and second films.\n\nThe reason this third effort doesn&apos;t work as well and is not as enjoyable is due to a variety of factors - TONE and PACING probably being the key reasons and also areas where it departs from the previous instalments.\n\nBy tone i mean a few things. Is there ridiculous over the top action in this film? Yes, most definitely, but the problem is in how it is being presented. The other movies made you laugh in their almost comic book presentation and stunts. This film is genuinely trying to sell itself as a serious action movie. They completely took the humour out of all the potentially very humorous moments through the more &apos;arty&apos; editing, over the top score dramatic score (soundtrack definitely plays a big part of the different tone in the 3rd movie) and generally lousy script.\n\nThis leads on to the pacing, which is far too slow at times. Way too much dialogue between Statham and the girl. Yes we know the character fairly well but the movies were always about the action and less the dialogue. Jason Statham is capable but the script can&apos;t really be saved here.\n\nSo, a dramatically more realistic Transporter movie but sucked dry of all the humorous and fun tone that made the previous instalments so much fun. As I said there are plenty of silly and deliberately humorous moments but the way it was constructed and presented meant I wasn&apos;t laughing anywhere near as much as I was in the other films. This in conclusion is the main failure of Transporter 3 - 5/10 just for being a new movie in an otherwise cool franchise.",

Jones as a bumbling staff officer, a &quot;love interest&quot; and a sub-plot showing the protagonist, played by Bill Holden, as an agonized alumni of a Korean POW camp.  In one of several galling items, he has made an attempt on his own life before the action began, but he is accepted as a test pilot anyway--which is absolutely bogus. Aircraft manufacturers are portrayed badly--which, in the main, the relevant history doesn&apos;t support.  Disregard of orders is treated with unrealistic indulgence by a commander.\n\n Read Scott Crossfield&apos;s autobiography for some corrects on this.\n\n On the other hand, some of the action is simply great.  A mythical bomber develops a metal fatigue problem in the air, which another pilot cannot duplicate.  Several weeks later, the plane&apos;s wing once again fails and this time it costs a third pilot his life. (My personal take on this--there&apos;s a big difference between &quot;fixing&quot; the blame and fixing the problem.)\n\nAt this point and at several others, the film is a worthy complement to the Edwards AFB scenes of &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.  The photography is simply stunning."

It provided me with a rare chance of stepping aside from the weary problematism of civilization, into an area most immediate to human nature. Being outcast, murder, suicide and all the problems of existence are treated here with great simplicity. Life is taken as it comes and people are alien to dramatism. Overall serenity dominates this non-dramatic environment. A great musical setting contributes to the the naive perception of being and the inner peace with which the viewer is left.

Set in a world where nothing makes sense and lightly attached to reality,a small 15th century country declares war on the United States hoping to lose.This rather easy plan is thwarted when the country&apos;s naive field marshal wins the war. It&apos;s not quite a masterpiece,but if you&apos;re a fan of British comedy lead by its finest Peter Sellers,this movie is a great way to spend your evening and have a couple of laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "Can&apos;t say I fell in love with this movie but it has a certain appeal to it. As far as cheesy, overblown, 80&apos;s, B-action movie flicks go, this is being a petty enjoyable and good movie for what it is! \n\nThere were certainly certain aspects about this movie that I appreciated. One was its story. Not that it&apos;s being much good or anything cleverly written but it at least takes the movie to plenty of good places and meets some good characters along the way. And how many actions movies set in rural Africa are out there anyway? The movie is great and unique already, just because of that.\n\nAnother thing I also liked about the movie and its story was that Dolph Lundgren was being both the villain and main hero of the movie. There isn&apos;t really being a main villains in this, since Dolph Lundgren is already on the &apos;wrong&apos; side and along the way switches sides, as he is growing more and more sympathy for his objective and their cause. the transitions his characters go through are pretty good to watch and gives the movie and its story something extra and more depth. It&apos;s probably also part of the reason why this movie is often being regarded as the ultimate Dolph Lundgren movie.\n\nAnd this movie also definitely benefits from Lundgren&apos;s presence. He&apos;s a very charismatic lead, even while he doesn&apos;t speak an awful lot. He handles all of the action very well, both the hand to hand combat scenes as the ones in which he has to handle a large gun.\n\nThe action itself is always something decent enough. Certainly nothing that blew me away but there are still some large setup moments that are great to watch and definitely something the &apos;80&apos;s action movie lover should enjoy and appreciate. \n\nIt&apos;s still being a totally silly and overblown action movie of course but if you&apos;re able to take it as just that, you&apos;ll most likely have a good time watching this movie.\n\n6/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Seemed like it had a cool idea going but it didn&apos;t really seem to get going.  Characters were not really developed enough.  The relationship between the costume maker and Irma Vep character did not get off the ground.  When things got interesting the movie was over. I would recommend it but only so as to view French film talking about itself.",

As Willie Stark he reeks of the abuse of power we have seen in the year&apos;s since. Never again does Crawford turn himself loose in a role that was really written for him. (In Highway Patrol all the chases were shot on private land - Crawford&apos;s driving license was revoked for numerous DUI infractions). You can&apos;t leave out Mercedes McCambridge. She is the perfect second lead. Her performance is filled with depth. Mercedes is the role model for today&apos;s woman. Tough yet filled with compassion.  She and Crawford provide sensation entertainment without one frame of CGI.  If you haven&apos;t seen this film, rent it, buy it or go to a retrospective. Your film going life is incomplete without a viewing."

You don&apos;t stop thinking &quot;why it has ended like this (after the first scene there&apos;s a retrospective)? what has happened?&quot;. The director Krzysztof Krauze plays with you decently, because you make your own vision of what will happen and after awhile you see you were not right. But &quot;Dlug&quot; is not only thrilling. It has a lot to think about. Some say that there are a few illogical things in the scenario, but anyway it seems realistic. There is no happy end, and there is no good character in whole picture. Everyone makes tragic go even more tragic. As good as it gets, actors make great creations, especially Andrzej Chyra as the &quot;terrorist&quot; (I live in Poland and believe me that&apos;s actually how illegal borrowing does finish).",

      "name": "Anti-war drama comes off as hollow",
      "reviewBody": "American director Edward Dmytryk headed to Italy to shoot &quot;Anzio&quot;, one the most lopsided World War II epics to come out of the 1960s. Despite some good intentions, this film fails as both an anti-war drama and an action piece.\n\nThe film stars Robert Mitchum (&quot;The Enemy Below&quot;) as Dick Ennis, a cold and cynical war correspondent that does his work on the front lines with the infantrymen. When the squad he is accompanying gets cut off behind the German lines due to an ambush, he must pick up a gun and help them fight their way back to Allied lines.\n\nThe movie has a lot going for it, right from the start. Every actor looks comfortable, especially Mitchum. Robert Mitchum has never been one of my favorite American actors, simply because he always seems to be acting  despite the dimensionality of the part, Mitchum can never seem to break out of a box. Here, he looks to be having plenty of fun and seems quite natural in the role. Mark Damon (&quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot;) provides the necessary dramatic opposite as an infantryman who can&apos;t seem to agree with Ennis on his policies. Arthur Kennedy (&quot;Attack and Retreat&quot;) is the exact opposite of Ennis&apos; character as the incompetent General Lesley, who takes too much time establishing a solid beachhead and allows the Germans to launch an offensive, pinning his men down on the beach. Peter Falk (&quot;Situation Normal, All Fouled Up&quot;), on the other hand, is totally wasted as Corporal Rabinoff, a soldier who has become addicted to combat. Earl Holliman (&quot;Armored Command&quot;) is the Sergeant in command of the squad, and he makes the most out of a clichéd-role by giving his character personality. Be sure to watch for Robert Ryan, Anthony Steel, Arthur Franz and Patrick Magee as Allied Generals.\n\nThere is only one big battle sequence, which expertly staged and filled with tanks, extras and big explosions. However, its effectiveness is limited because of two key flaws. Primarily, American soldiers are seen to stand up in the open and rush German machine-gun nests, only to be mowed down by overwhelming enemy fire. Secondly, there&apos;s a ridiculous scene in which Ennis and a soldier engage in a discussion about the war right in the middle of a fight, despite the fact that bullets and artillery shells are landing all around them! The final, small-scale, climactic showdown with German snipers was much more suspenseful, due to some excellent editing and great music score.\n\nOne major flaw in the film is, unfortunately, the script. It&apos;s as if &quot;Anzio&quot; can&apos;t decide if it wants to be a gung-ho flag-waver, or a downbeat, anti-war story. The first half the film is filled with humorous, almost slapstick scenes, although some of Mitchum&apos;s dialog hints that this is going to change  and it does, in fact the focus turns around 180 degrees. Throughout the second half of the film, the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters discuss issues of personal sacrifice, what constitutes above and beyond the call of duty, etc until it&apos;s been repeated so much that you can&apos;t stand to hear anymore. For all of this discussion, the conclusion is pretty forced. Mitchum says something along the lines of, &quot;Men kill each other because they like to. Maybe if we all sit back and realize it, we could stop the killing and get along.&quot; That statement defines over-emphasis. Instead of being a history lesson about the real Anzio campaign, the film turns into a social commentary on Vietnam.\n\nThe on-location shooting served the proceedings well, as the film looks like sunny Italy in every frame. The scene in the Italian house looked excellent, and Dmytryk uses wide angles throughout to show off the scope of the Italian locales. The score ranges from victorious and rousing to mournful and depressing, which contributes a great deal to the mood of some important scenes  such as the entry into liberated Rome and the significance of one character&apos;s death in the sniper sequence.\n\n&quot;Anzio&quot; is a mixed bag, but despite a lack of focus on one theme, it manages to be entertaining and satisfying as a drama, with enough well-staged action scenes to hold it together and help obscure the muddled anti-war sentiments.",

Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner play two brothers who climb a mountain - but the characters and motives are very different, and there are twists in store when they reach the top.\n\nTracy is always watchable, and this is no exception. He plays a simple man, a good climber and a deeply honourable person. His younger brother (a very beautiful-looking 26-year old Robert Wagner) is everything he isn&apos;t: greedy, lazy, shallow and petulant. The climbing scenes are terrific. Even if you aren&apos;t interested in climbing (I&apos;m not) they are so precise and tense you will find yourself mesmerised. But it&apos;s really the actors, and the relationship between the two characters, who hold your attention.\n\nIf you find this film on TV it&apos;s likely to be in the afternoon. And it&apos;s a very good way to spend a couple of hours. The cliché is unavoidable, but they really don&apos;t make them like this anymore!",

The plot may appear simple but the way it is portrayed in a thrilling way throughout without any flaws, introducing each role at appropriate time with most of them strongly connected to the main story(though i feel one or two characters not very needed to the film,we can give it up as they don&apos;t deviate you from the plot)is really superb.\n\nHello movie goers, don&apos;t even think to miss this movie. Go for the movie mainly for KamalHaasan who has taken really painful efforts and excelled in all ten lovable characters and i promise the movie will hold you up providing a 3 hour non stop entertainment in terms of action,special effects,comedy and a thrilling adventure no matter any genre lover you are..",

Movies like &quot;Duplex&quot; and scenes like the toilet scene in &quot;Along came Polly&quot;, that&apos;s really not my cup tea.\n\nTara Reid and Terence Stamp is the only thing pulling this movie up, she does a good job playing the daughter, while he is the father and the boss of Kutcher.\n\nAshton Kutcher is playing Tom Stansfield a employee of the creative department in Jack Taylor (Terence Stamps) company. He is looking for his big break, but Jack isn&apos;t the easiest guy to be around. Lisa Taylor (Reid) gets Tom to watch her daddy&apos;s bird, while she goes to a party. This is where everything really starts falling apart for Tom.\n\nThe only part of this movie that I found funny, involved Jack Taylor, being the really mean boss. Other that that the only highlight was Carmen Electra falling in the fountain, and could have been in a &quot;miss wet t-shirt&quot; competition. \n\nOnly watch this movie if you are a die hard fan of Ashton Kutcher, &apos;cause he is the main character, and none of the other actors is really involved in this movie, or if you love movies like Duplex, and other similar movies, which are even more embarrassing to watch.\n\n2/10 and never to be seen again.. EVER."

The premise- virus spread by birds threatens to overrun the world- is sound enough in and of itself. The special effects and fight choreography are professionally done. And the film is very well photographed. In fact, if you put on a good CD and run this with the closed captioning on you might really enjoy it.\n\nBut no film can be better than the performances by the actors, and these actors couldn&apos;t do worse. I don&apos;t know that they&apos;re really inept or untalented actors. But they were born in Germany and as best I can tell are trying to perform in English, so you get some really off the wall line readings.\n\nWe&apos;ve seen this story before. Young man goes to his grandfather&apos;s home after the old man passes away. On the way into town he and his friends meet a couple of cute girls and run afoul of some local louts. The sun sets, the zombies come out to play, mayhem ensues.\n\nBut because of the inept acting it&apos;s almost impossible to feel any connection to these characters and the screenplay doesn&apos;t really develop them as individuals.\n\nThe more I write, the more I think my concluding sentence in the first paragraph is right. In fact, there are so many clichés on parade here- wow, German cops live on donuts, too!- that you might not even want to run the closed captioning.\n\nFootnote: Definite kudos to the director for being named Wolf Wolff. Please, Lord, let that be his real name. I don&apos;t see any major directing career for the man, but that is a totally righteous name."

      "reviewBody": "Having read some of the more negative reviews on this site, all I can say is that they all seem to have the same complaint in common. Namely, non-acceptance of certain plot contrivances. \n\nSo let me say straight off: if you are the sort of person who didn&apos;t like Inception because it made no sense, or the sort of person who didn&apos;t like The Matrix Trilogy because it made no sense, or indeed the sort of person who didn&apos;t like any of David Lynch&apos;s films because (ahem) NONE OF THEM MAKE ANY SENSE...in short, if you are an incurable pedant, you will not enjoy this film and you might as well stop reading this review. Seriously, stop reading, don&apos;t watch the film and go calculate Pi or something.\n\nIf, however, you have an appreciation for tightly-edited, emotionally engaging, aesthetically pleasing cinema with a brilliant soundtrack and at times breathless pacing, please allow me to take a few minutes of your time.\n\nHanna is the story of a teenage girl who lives in total isolation with her father. She has vague memories of her mother, and these memories, combined with her (literally) encyclopedic knowledge fuel her desire to leave the relative safety of her father&apos;s protection in the frozen hinterland of northern Finland.\n\nIn a way, I don&apos;t want to say any more than that. If you&apos;ve read the other reviews on this site that give away more, then I&apos;m very sorry for you, but if not then suffice it to say that her father&apos;s motivation for keeping her in this state of isolation appears to be protection, combined with a desire to train her in survival/assassination skills, in preparation for...well that would be telling. \n\nOf course, you don&apos;t need me to tell you that she leaves her father&apos;s protection and the story proper begins. As Chekov said &quot;One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no-one is thinking of using it&quot; and boy, does that rifle get used. \n\nSaoirse Ronan is brilliant as Hanna. At times seemingly invincible, at others pathetically vulnerable, owing to her complete inexperience of the world. We see the world from her unique perspective as she struggles to understand non-familiar interaction, the natural ease of recreation and even the basic electrical appliances that we all take for granted.\n\nThe story moves us from one location to the next, painting a rich tapestry of colour and culture, whilst simultaneously (and somewhat comically) contrasting Hanna&apos;s desperate need to traverse these territories with the bourgeoisie&apos;s seeming obsession with &quot;experiencing&quot; as many of them as possible.\n\nThe acting is solid throughout. The only truly great performance comes from Ronan, but Tom Hollander, Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana all turn out good performances that serve the picture well.\n\nHowever the true credit for this film has to be laid at the feet of Joe Wright. None of his previous films could possibly prepare you for Hanna. Wright&apos;s mastery of both a tight, intricate plot such as in Atonement, combined with his incredible skill in making this beautiful, thoughtful, action-packed coming of age story mark him out as a director of real class.\n\nIt is true that Hanna suffers from a few plot holes, but that plot is delivered in such an appealing, exciting and above-all entertaining film that anyone who isn&apos;t compiling continuity errors for some god-awful TV programme that relishes in the fact that THIS ISN&apos;T REAL LIFE, IT&apos;S ACTUALLY ONLY A FILM!! should have a blast letting this film take them along for the ride. \n\nIf you want reality, watch a documentary. If you want a very good fiction, watch Hanna.",

I saw this film at the Tribeca Festival and then again when it opened Aug 08. This film is truly one of the best docs I have ever seen. It is fantastic and opened my eyes and ears to one of this country&apos;s national treasures. I have not seen any other footage of Anita before I saw this. I have looked and could not find anything out on her. Except the 30 seconds clips on her web page. This docs shows her in all of her incredible splendor and humor. She is feisty and honest and just plain cool. So Rotten Tomatoes gives her 100% since the Tribeca opening, pretty impressive and finally a film that really matches the critical acclaim.",

      "reviewBody": "Ok... I&apos;ve read through most of the posted comments posted before this about this movie; I find that some people love the music, but think the characters are thin; some hate Eddie Murphy&apos;s presence, and think the love story is stupid. Well, your experience with a film is individual, I guess.\n\nThat said, I&apos;ll follow the trail and state why I loved watching this movie not once, but several times:\n\nFirst of all, I&apos;m far from being a fan of animated Disney classics. I&apos;m in that age between child and adult(currently 23), where everything is a rebelry. Most of my viewing pleasures is action or its like.\n\nMy original incentive for seeing this movie was to please a friend of mine, who has a long-life fascination for oriental culture (read: karate films!). When Mulan was released in Denmark, a single copy with the original voices track (usually all animated Disneys are dubbed into danish with good result) was shown in a local theater. Asking a couple of girls out, we went and saw it. Ok, I was blown away. Before I had left the cinema that day, I too was captured by chinese history and culture. The singing and music I was prepared for; I knew The Jungle Book and Aristocats from childhood. The songs didn&apos;t mean anything to me, other than that they were few - good for me. (Some of them do kling to the ear - irritating for me!) I quickly realised Eddie Murphy was on the voices cast. I started liking the movie right then. Some find him malplaced in a Disney epic, but fact is that the business of animating classics is profiting well these years in bringing in already established names to the animations; Tom Hanks in the Toy Stories, Mel Gibson in Pocahontas, Robin Williams in Aladdin, and who else I don&apos;t know of. These names sell the film before the film have a chance to sell itself. (The danish producers, by the way, have stolen this idea when dubbing the films, using local media stars for the voice cast.) Well...it did work for me. Eddie Murphy is not as funny in this production as he is in others, but what the heck...he can&apos;t exactly use too much harsh language, it IS a children&apos;s flick. But with the room he got, his speedy tongue made me laugh again and again. I have later seen Aladdin, and find Eddie Murphy&apos;s achievement as funny as Robin Williams&apos;. That Eddie Murphy chose this project was an interesting and probably very clever career move. Later, when I studied the rest of the cast list, I noticed a lot of chinese names. That very much pleased me. Who other than Chinese people to tell a Chinese tale to Westerners? I found some old friends, Soon-Tek Oh and James Hong, people who had worked with Chick Norris in the 80&apos;s. Pat Morita as the emperor made me smile. B.D.Wong I remembered from Jurrasic Park, but Ming-Na was new to me (had to look her up in IMDB, was stunned not to have known her before (Ok, I went wow!)). Harvey Fierstein as a ploppy little soldier and Miguel Ferrer as the Hun leader I found the perfect voice-choice for their characters...other names rang also. Anyway, a lot of the above have only value after you&apos;ve seen the film. When you are an Atlantic ocean from most of the sales pitch, the film had to sell itself. It did - for me, anyway. Before then, I knew little about China and her history apart from things here and there (read: karate films!). Meeting angient China like this totally threw me away. Wership of the ancestors, the power and position of the emperor, I found myself lost in the dream of a world long gone; I loved the image of a China with different traditions but still found myself attracted to the pro-Disney story about a girl standing up to a culture&apos;s sexist prejudice. (I do find the plot a bit silly, actually, but I let myself be taken away...it&apos;s just a Disney.) Agree, the characters lack a little bit, the love story of Mulan and Shang should perhaps have had a few more frames to play with. The project was a little bit tuned down from the Disney board of directors, but honor to all who worked with it: You people did a good job! The computer animation used for the Great Wall and the attack of the Huns startles me again and again; Not many live movies can do the job as good.\n\nSo that&apos;s what Mulan is for me...The dream of ancient China and Eddie Murphy&apos;s speedy tongue. I accept the term classic. I have the damn thing on video now (English language) and must prevent myself from seeing it too often, in fright of one day getting tired of it."

The daughter (Jodhi May) is bullied in school, where her classmates call her father a &quot;traitor&quot;. Finally, the mother (Barbara Hershey) is arrested. The daughter then truly begins to see the oppressive system through the eyes of the black population.\n\nThe whole story resembles that of the Rosenberg children, right down to the fate of the parents (Mrs. Slovo was assassinated in 1982). And it is so horrible to think that this vile agenda was in power for over forty years. There may be some things in life that we will never be able to get over.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Goud&quot; (= Dutch for &quot;gold&quot;) is a Dutch documentary film about Holland&apos;s national ladies&apos; hockey-team. It focuses on their preparation for and performance at the world championships hockey in Spain, 2006. You will understand that the Dutch ladies won this tournament, beating Australia in the final.\n\n&quot;Goud&quot; is a lively and well-made film, providing good entertainment all the way down. However, it strongly focuses on the inter-human &amp; social developments in this ladies&apos; community. On its male trainer, too, who tirelessly tries to build up a strong team spirit.\n\nPeople knowing about team-sports may be disappointed that equally important matters like technology in handling a hockey-stick, tactics during a match, and building up physical endurance, are very much neglected.\n\nMy last words are for the ladies themselves. As far as I can judge, their recorded behavior provides a fairly adequate picture of themselves.",

      "reviewBody": "Some folks are partying, a girl named Lou is dragged somewhere by a guy. Next the girl meets with some girlfriends complaining about not feeling well. They joke that she&apos;s pregnant. Some sinister guys are collecting urine from females in a fridge. One of them has her lips chewed off or something.\n\nLou in the meantime starts feeling weirder and weirder and sicker and sicker and indeed starts developing a belly. But that doesn&apos;t keep her from getting high non-stop. She has some weird visions. All this takes place in some poor town with a Marine base. There&apos;s an awful lot of talk and taking drugs and ridiculous music and silly visions.\n\nAt some point Lou meets a woman who seems to have some idea what&apos;s going on. She tells her that someone has implanted her with something. She suspects the government is behind this. With her help Lou tracks down some of the bad guys and we more or less find out what they are up to.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t take long for Lou to be full term and to give birth and here the movie manages to surprise. Some other characters also make an appearance and things do get interesting.\n\nAntibirth focuses on a bunch of ugly people doing ugly things and who listen to hideous music. It&apos;s not easy caring about any of them or what&apos;s going on, which isn&apos;t really much. This is one of those movies, where everything that is said matters. At this pace the movie would have been a solid 2/10. But then suddenly the ending is pretty surprising. The movie works toward something, you know or hope that something interesting will happen, but at the same time you quickly give up. But then suddenly the movie does deliver and it changes one&apos;s perspective of the entire film for the better. Clearly a lot more could have been done with this script and the budget should have allowed for a better movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Objectified is a rather dated, but still interesting documentary about objects and their importance in our society. One of the main things that I remember from the film is the absolute genius of the plastic, practically disposable chair that is made out of one piece that it could be made in one mold. One machine clamps coat closed, and in the next second the man pulls out a chair. Everywhere you will see this chair in different designs but the key is one piece of plastic, one single mold. Sometimes it&apos;s not the most beautiful design that wins. But the most utilitarian reminded me a lot of my visit to the Design Museum in Cologne, where I saw fantastic chairs, tables and other early design objects as well as an IBM Selectric typewriter, an iPod, an iMac and other objects that I have once owned. Design is important in our life. Look at the rounded corners of the phone you&apos;re holding. I enjoyed objectified\n\nTranscribed by Otter.",

      "reviewBody": "Well I didn&apos;t watch this show on cinema, I watched it about 2 months after the actual premiere and it is showed on cable TV.\n\nWell the story was quite good, it tells about 2 individuals that had problems with love (similar to each other) and apparently been told in both male and female point of view, is quite original but still fall short to grab the audiences. The fact that they used unknown actors has its own pros and cons. Some actors actually put a spice on the movie but the other just made the movie look dull, and destroying the over all illusion.\n\nNow the major problem is on the mise-en-shot, the director or the producer can spend more money on lighting or learn how to use it properly. I mean don&apos;t they know that neon light give out green light. If they going for the Matrix green look that&apos;s understandable but the matrix uses high power neon light to clear up the shadows. The second thing is the shadows, there&apos;re so many shadows build up on the actors, especially neck and below the eyes, and this just make the over-all scenes look dull. Don&apos;t get me wrong I know they use lighting in certain part of the movie but people haven&apos;t you heard about white balance and if you mess it up already use the gamma correction or the RGB color balance or even re-shot. Believe me re-shooting is better than leaving the scenes as it is, since one of the major factors of a movie is over all visualization.\n\nMoney is not the problem here believe me I seen movie with very little budget do wonders, oversea and in Malaysia it self. The Blair Witch Project, The beautiful washing machine just to name a few. The camera shouldn&apos;t be a problem also, is you can used film in all of the scenes be different. Michael Mann Collateral and the up coming Miami Vice used Digital video and it looks great, is different some people might not like it but is has that x-factors that put it on different class above the rest. Or you can change the frame rate to 24p, some high end digital camera has that now like canon XL-2, hell some short film uses mini dv cam and the visualization looks amazing.\n\nWell I guess is just they did spend more time during the post production period and do a bit more research on how to handle things. If they did that believe me it will make this movie a much better movie. Neither the less it was a good effort, hope they&apos;ll learn from their mistake and correct it on their next project.",

      "reviewBody": "In THE RETURN, a businesswoman is drawn to a small town where a woman was murdered 15 years before. The murderer was never caught although suspicion fell on the slain woman&apos;s beau. The businesswoman, played by a dark-haired and rather subdued Sarah Gellar, sees the face of this woman in dreams and even in mirrors. She tracks down the woman&apos;s boyfriend, whom she seems to know, and eventually they sort out the mystery and uncover the real killer. The ending contains a twist that most murder mystery fans will have guessed much earlier, but it came as a shock to me, as I am not particularly good at this kind of thing (although I knew what happened in THE SIXTH SENSE as soon as Don Wahlberg shot Bruce Willis, the result of my years working as an ER orderly). Gellar is low-key and acts just unnerved enough by all the odd doings to be believable. The film is shot mostly in monotone, and this adds to the brooding atmosphere. Sam Shepherd has a small role as Gellar&apos;s dad.",

However the story is pathetic and the movie can&apos;t quite get off the ground because of it. There are some crude heavy handed attempts at character development but they are awkward and sophomoric. The fight scenes are fun but it&apos;s obvious the camera tricks were used to cover up the lack of skill of some of the fighters. Yumiko Shaku is a rare gem of a human being, it&apos;s a pity her skills and beauty were wasted on this skimpy retarded plot.",

      "reviewBody": "Kanji Watanabi is a quiet, melancholy man who has spent all his life behind his office desk doing sweet eff-all. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.\n\nThis is Akira Kurosawa&apos;s masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody&apos;s life- how we don&apos;t even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi&apos;s quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it&apos;s one of the greatest film performances of all time. \n\nNot everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it&apos;s pretty long. Many people today, especially young kids, would find it boring. Well, let &apos;em. There&apos;s no need to worry about them, they&apos;ll always have Pirates of the Carribbean, they&apos;ll always have The Matrix. Leave Ikiru and films like it to the true lovers of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Farinelli is not nearly as awful as I feared it would be. It&apos;s similar in many ways to Amadeus. Like Amadeus, it has glorious music beautifully performed. Like Amadeus, it tells a good (if melodramatic) story. Like Amadeus, it has a marvelous period feel. Like Amadeus, the characters in this story have the names and occupations of real people, but their portrayal on the screen is not even caricature: a caricature necessarily starts with something recognizeable.\n\nFarinelli was famous in history not merely for a phenomenal voice and outstanding musicianship and musical connoisseurship, but for poise, dignity, and perfect-pitch judgement of human character; he is portrayed throughout as a hysteric. Handel is shown as a pompous, bullying nervous wreck verging on the psychotic, quite at variance with all reliable accounts of his humor, sturdiness, practicality, and reputation for scrupulous probity toward his musicians and singers.\n\nHandel could not have said, to Farinelli, during the latter&apos;s first sensational season with the Opera of the Nobility, that he would never write another opera, and not just because Handel was no faux-Freudian opera queen: Lady History inconveniently discloses that after that 1733-34 season Handel composed and presented Ariodante, Alcina, Atalanta, Giustino, Arminio, Berenice, Faramondo, Serse, and Imeneo; his last opera, Deidamia, went unperformed, but several in that list were significant successes, and some were revived more than once.\n\nThe two rival opera companies in London went down the drain more or less simultaneously, notwithstanding the enormous draw of Farinelli for the Nobility company, and notwithstanding the high quality of the music of its principal composers (Porpora, Hasse, undervalued today) and the stupendous quality of Handel&apos;s music (also undervalued); rather, the people with the money to afford the (by our standards) enormous ticket prices had simply lost interest.\n\nOne commentator here is skeptical about many &quot;period&quot; details. And rightly: for starters, that&apos;s not the way boys were castrated, but you don&apos;t need to know the truth. Relax, just enjoy the music and the costumes and the actors chewing the scenery."

There are several messages along the way:  1) Some humans are more beastly than animals; 2) Forgiveness is a powerful healer; and 3) Protect the wilderness, for it contains many wonderful things that are not always apparent to us.  This movie is a family favorite!",

For me, producing more with less always seemed an outcome of cinematic expertise.  That kind of Minimalism makes this movie great.  The themes and situations displayed in this movie are so relatable, and i bet you&apos;ll find your self giggling (for a wide Spectrum of reasons: from sympathy to embarrassment).  It&apos;s light and have a natural flow, the acting is very authentic and sensitive.  The script is superb, and the camerawork also contributes to the &quot;Ostlund experience&quot;, together forming an honourable picture.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an Oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one Arabian nights¨ with plenty of incredible adventures , fantasy , witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad (attractive John Justin) who loses his throne, he then escapes thanks to a little thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They arrive in Basora where Ahamad and the charming princess (gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love . But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar , Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog . The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring , a flying mechanic horse , a magic bow , a flying carpet and of course the colossal genie (overacting by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu , the magic eye , the figure of goddess Kali with several hands , among others.\n\nThis remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time . Produced by London Fim&apos;s Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger , Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogue writer and actor as a Sultan fond to mechanic games . The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting , then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming , in especial on location in Grand Canyon Colorado . The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda , Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile , though today are dated and being urgent a necessary remastering because of the colors are worn-out. Furthermore, one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa . This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will appeal to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs.",

The growth of the character is so forced and out of place and the environment just leads to more questions and confusion.\n\nThe humour is forced and lackluster and if you&apos;re looking for a heartwarming comedy then this isn&apos;t the show for you. I personally wouldn&apos;t recommend this show to anyone. The only redeeming factor of this show is the adorable baby but they somehow manage to ruin it by using a voice-over for cheap comedy. I can remember scenes that would have been much better had the baby not said anything.\n\nHowever I can&apos;t discount the fact that people who enjoy Korean-based TV shows would enjoy it because a favorite actor of theirs is in it. I don&apos;t know any of these actors and I&apos;m reviewing it based solely on my enjoyment.",

Yes, it&apos;s a fairly basic plot which could never be described as &quot;feel-good&quot; but that isn&apos;t (and it never was) a priority. No, its priority is the heart and soul that was put into it.\n\nWhat we got here is a satirical view on the middle class situation with anti-death penalty as it&apos;s theme throughout the runtime. The guy in the film is literally out of luck and after having to marry the executioner&apos;s daughter things begin to change for him for no good. Nino Manfredi&apos;s performance as Jose Luis is superb, Jose Ibert is just as splendid.\n\nThe screenplay is crammed in Kafka-esque tone to expose the bureaucratic horror with one of the grotesquely funny and Powerful final scene. The ending is easily one of the most memorable ever, it&apos;s just so heartwrenching and profound.",

Runata has been in Arkanar for years and is viewed as a form of God.

The sets, sounds and particularly the visuals are quite extraordinary with tunnels of mud, death and excrement seemingly stretching on forever and full of decaying people barely existing in their squalor.

      "name": "The Finest Work of Lamberto Bava I&apos;ve Seen Yet",
      "reviewBody": "Italian horror director Lamberto Bava&apos;s directorial debut, &quot;Macabre&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Frozen Terror&quot;) is a tale of passionate obsession, murder, madness and some blind guy who fixes saxophones. A mother has a secret love, and the blind man slowly but surely stumbles upon it... which takes a bit longer when you&apos;re blind. And when he finds out who it is, things get a little creepy. Okay, a lot creepy.\n\nThis film has received some heavy criticism from horror historians Travis Crawford and Jim Harper, and for my review I&apos;d like to address their concerns, as I believe they&apos;ve made some crucial points.\n\nCrawford is mostly praising in his words, calling this film &quot;a humid hothouse hybrid of Tennessee Williams and Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, but questions Bava&apos;s ability to create his own work. He points to Bava&apos;s own words, giving credit to Pupi Avati, a more accomplished Italian director who co-wrote this film. Crawford says Avati &quot;had a significant degree of input into the overall creation of the film&quot;, &quot;shaped the stylistic approach&quot; and even &quot;dictated&quot; the &quot;restrained, subtle technique&quot;. With Avati also being the one to find the newspaper article on which the story is based, it seems as though this should be credited as his work, with Bava as more of an assistant or apprentice.\n\nCrawford notes that it would be &quot;cynical&quot; to point out that Bava&apos;s best work came under the guidance of an accomplished director, or even to say that his other notable film -- the &quot;Demons&quot; series -- were supervised by Dario Argento. But cynical or not, and as much credit as Bava deserves, it&apos;s a fair statement to say that his collaborations are much stronger than his solo career. (With regards to &quot;Demons&quot;, the style is certainly not like Argento&apos;s other work, so how much credit he deserves is debatable.) Harper is also critical. While highlighting this as &quot;a complex and increasingly bizarre tale&quot;, he pins the style as reminiscent of Mario Bava, Lamberto&apos;s father. Like Crawford, he also notes that Bava&apos;s films went downhill after &quot;Demons 2&quot; (1986), when Bava went solo. Where I agree most with Harper is his labeling of the &quot;unfortunate&quot; ending as the &quot;only truly sour note&quot;. I can&apos;t reveal what the ending is, but it doesn&apos;t fit the film at all and takes what would otherwise be a great film and lowers it to slightly better than average. A shame... perhaps it would have been best to cut the last few minutes entirely.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a mystery that paces itself and has a few very gory moments, &quot;Macabre&quot; is a worthy choice. While not on par with Argento&apos;s work, or Fulci&apos;s, it&apos;s a solid effort from Lamberto Bava and any Italian horror fan will like it. Others may be turned off by the slow pace, poor dubbing and inferior sound and picture quality (a staple of Italian film for some reason). Why won&apos;t more Italian films come with subtitles? Enjoyment of this film is a matter of taste. But the rich depth of these characters is a welcome change of pace from the splatter scene.",

      "name": "Thrilling Belmondo movie packed with noisy action , violence , plot twists and high body-count",
      "reviewBody": "Nail-biting Jean-Paul Belmondo film , full of frantic action , intrigue , twists , turns , a lot of murders and a suspenseful as well as surpring ending . This is a French ¨Polar¨ packing thrills , emotion , non-stop action , good performances , spectacular pursuits , and a moving finale . It concerns a French secret agent nicknamed L&apos;Alpagueur , he&apos;s really a free-lance spy from the French secret agency . He is sent to execute a dangerous mission : to kill a series murderer . He&apos;s put on the investigation about L&apos;epervier , a serial-killer who employs young boys to help him robbing banks before killing them . To attempt to communicate a jailed witness he&apos;s put in imprisonment . After a daring getaway he encounters some tracks about the heinous killer . And so begins a relentless manhunt . As L&apos;epervieris (Bruno Cremer) being relentlessly chased by L&apos;Alpagueur (Belmondo). Some animals get away with Murder, rape, torture. Doesn&apos;t it make your blood boil? Well - THE HUNTER did something about it.\n\nThis is an intriguing film that contains frenetic action , suspense , thrills , double-crosses , chases , violent denouement and anything else . Not the least bit believable , but quite entertaining , especially towards the end. It&apos;s one of those roles in which Belmondo does things , which is what made him so attractive as a New Wave anti-hero . He&apos;s still playing the anti-hero, of course, but there are no heroes , just middle-aged , corrupt people , thugs , and an extremely villain assassin . Belmondo lets you see the years and weariness creep up on him , particularly in the scenes with Bruno Cremer . Mostly , though , he is what the title of the movie suggests , a thorough professional , who takes well-calculated risks that confound the people who attempt to stop . He&apos;s just doing a job as a bounty hunter , and as always he survives , as Belmondo is a complete show , as he runs and leaps ; he escapes , and executes his own stunts . Belmondo sports an inimitable smile while jumps , shots and kills ; as usual , he combines action with sympathy . The movie highlights result to be the thrilling getaway and the final confrontation between Belmondo and Bruno Cremer . Enjoyable acting by the two main star names , Jean Paul Belmondo and Bruno Cremer . Belmondo steals the spectacle , as usual at the time , playing splendidly the secret agent who&apos;s double-crossed and is bent on taking his sweet vengeance on those who betrayed him and bring war along the way . Belmondo makes as his own stunts , in fact he always performed all the stunts himself but ceased to do so after the accident during the filming of ¨Hold Up¨(1985) . Interesting and twisted screenplay by Philippe Labro himself , along with Jacques Lanzmann , though it has some flaws and shortcomings . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Jean Penzer , considered to be one of the best French cameramen , who photographed various Belmondo films . Wonderful soundtrack by Michel Colombier , including a catching and emotive leitmotif .\n\nThe picture was successful at box office , ranking one of the highest grossing movie of its year in France . The motion picture was well written and directed by Philippe Labro , though it contains some gaps , shortfalls and some non-sense scenes . Labro is a writer and director, specially known for Tout peut arriver (1969) , The Heir (1973) and L&apos;alpagueur or The Hunter Will Get You (1976). Journalist, songwriter and author , his parents are deemed Justs having sheltered members of the family of Maurice Bernart . He was an expert on action genre , and realized various vehicles for famous French actors , such as Yves Montand (Chance and violence ), Gerard Depardieu (Rive Droite, Rive Gauche) , Claude Brasseur (La Crime) and, of course , Belmondo (The Heir , L&apos;alpagueur or The Hunter Will Get You) . The director Philippe Labro was a disciple and a great friend of Jean-Pierre Melville, who died three years before this shooting. Rating : 6/10 , acceptable film for Jean-Paul Belmondo fans and action aficionados .",

      "reviewBody": "I heard about AiVA while searching for ways to start an acting career. Being a huge fan of anime and manga I decided to give this DVD a shot. If was unable to establish a career as a stage actor I could have some education on the other option of being a voice actor as well. It arrived in the mail about a week later and from the second it booted up in my DVD player I was enthralled. I won&apos;t spoil it for you, but it&apos;s rare that you&apos;ll have so much fun starting up a DVD. As I watched for around 2 hours, I actually had to take a break and come back to it to digest and continue to absorb more. I didn&apos;t completely do that by choice; this DVD literally has that much info on it. Everything that every person said was important and had a substantial amount of value to my future. I&apos;m no journalist and I don&apos;t plan on writing an epic review of this, though it truly deserves one. But, I can not recommend this DVD enough if you are at all interested in having voice acting be a part of your career or your whole career. While this DVD has been marketed towards anime fans, it is undoubtedly worth much more than that. It will fill you with confidence as you hear the struggles, trials, and tribulations of other voice actors who have been exactly where you/I are and have made it doing what they love. I was actually somewhat jaded by anime around the time I ordered this as I was more interested in live-action stuff, but this struck a cord with me. It not only re-ignited my passion for anime, but built several other layers for my passion for acting and theater in general, to which I was still new to at the time. I hope it does the same for you. It is well-worth a purchase.",

It&apos;s plagued with bad acting, impossible feats and a paper-thin plot, just like the other drifting/tuning movies that have sprouted since Fast&amp;Furious. Seeing this movie with subtitles is absolutely necessary, though I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some very bad dubbed version, seeing as Malaysian apparently has a lot of slang words in English, but it was still funny to hear them talking in a style that would make Kimi Raikkonen jealous. \n\nOnto the really important parts: the drifting is good, the driving is very good, and the action isn&apos;t too over the top, yet everything else manages to be very annoying to say the least. The editing is probably my biggest problem with it, since it made the characters look wooden and for some very awkward moments. Any attempts at drama are half-baked and predictable, but one thing I have to give this movie props for is that there is no formulaic happy ending. We never truly find out what happens in the end and a lot of questions are left unanswered, which most probably is to lead to a sequel, but also meant that all the stupid scenes could be erased from my memory. Hopefully this will be a breakout movie for many of the ones in it, but stand alone, it&apos;s not much worth it.",

Sure, it&apos;s a macho-man movie, but it works, and to see the talent (both actors and ex-pro ball players) on the screen, this is a movie you can watch over and over. By the way, it was refreshing to see the widescreen DVD version which was just released."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a pretty weird experience, watching this movie. An affectionate, warm-hearted reunion for Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, it is also a bittersweet farewell to an old era of movies. It will probably appeal only to fans of the duo, as they once again go through their familiar motions (Spencer&apos;s mutterings, Hill&apos;s smiles, bean-eating, fist-fighting, helping the poor, etc.), only this time there are some serious dramatic moments as well. On the other hand, considering their age, you can&apos;t help but wonder if perhaps this film should never have been made, if they should have retired more gracefully a few years earlier. But if you insist on seeing it, try to avoid the DVD version, as the image has been blown up way out of proportion to fill the entire screen - perhaps in keeping with the tradition of the awful full-screen versions of the &quot;Trinity&quot; films (to which this film is without a doubt an unofficial sequel - I wonder why they couldn&apos;t make it &quot;official&quot;).

I certainly don&apos;t remember the part where Ford Prefect gets a labotomy and mumbles throughout the book. In fact, Ford had no presence in this movie whatsoever! In the book he&apos;s witty, charming, mischievous. In the movie, he&apos;s a zombie. The scene where he&apos;s scarfing down beer at the beginning isn&apos;t even explained! It makes no sense without explaining that he&apos;s trying to minimize the effects of hitchhiking.\n\nZooey feels like she&apos;s reciting her lines.\n\nArthur is just some guy in this story who makes funny faces once in awhile.\n\nSlartibartfast obviously had the same acting coach as Mos Def since they were basically the same character (mumbling, weird pauses..).\n\nKudos to Sam Rockwell as I kinda liked his Zaphod, but even that character fell apart at the end.\n\nThe ending. Whoah boy! Talk about dumbing the movie down for mass consumption and completely screwing up the events in the books. So I guess there&apos;s not going to be a prehistoric earth in the second movie because SURPRISE Earth was completely restored and everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nBlech.\n\nI keep hearing &quot;True to the spirit of Douglas Adams!&quot; Maybe the guide, the heart of gold and the parts that didn&apos;t have actors in it.\n\nTry the BBC version. Sure, it didn&apos;t have the special effects budget, but it retained the story and the &quot;spirit of Douglas Adams&quot; much better."

      "reviewBody": "The first Warlock film with Julian Sands and Richard E. Grant was great - original, fun, a bit gory, and suspenseful. It had pretty well defined characters, and a plot that moved. (I bet the movie would have been terrific if it&apos;s budget had been about 3 times bigger for special FX.) I Feel the second installment Warlock: The Armagedon, was okay, but a bit cheesy with the magic druid theme going. Though the plot was a bit dodgy because they weren&apos;t chasing after the warlock, the improved FX and magical scenarios made the movie palatable.\n\nThis third installment though is pathetic. The editing is horrible, the film drags on and on for the first 40 minutes or so. The lead character is very flat, and the Warlock is also quite flat. Although that is kind of how the warlock character has always been portrayed, calm, cold, and collected, which worked when the other leads where quite animated, but is terrible here with the boring lead. At least there are the side kicks in W3 to spice things up, as the two leads are excruciatingly lame characters.\n\nAs the film is slow at the beginning, one doesn&apos;t know if it is going to be about the house, or about the Warlock. And I think that where they missed it. If they had focused less on the &quot;haunted house&quot; aspect early on, and more or flashbacks with the warlock, it may have turned out better.\n\nIf you are a fan of the previous two Warlock films its worth renting, but prepare yourself for boredom and disappointment.\n\nIf you&apos;ve never seen the previous Warlock films, skip this one, rent Warlock (1989) and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a broad range of quality in every realm of cinema...\n\n...take the western genre, for instance. You&apos;ve got classics like SHANE and RIO BRAVO, and plenty of junk like DESERT MESA and THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN. Great musicals such as SINGIN&apos; IN THE RAIN have antipodes like THE APPLE, and for every masterstroke of comedy like DUCK SOUP or THIS IS SPINAL TAP, you have a GIGLI or IT&apos;S PAT at the ass-end. I think it&apos;s safe to say that the horror genre&apos;s good/bad ratio gets a bit more skewed toward the negative. Then, of course...there&apos;s porn...\n\nCan we critique both mainstream and adult films using the same obiter-dicta? Of course we can&apos;t, though there&apos;s clearly a similar spectrum of quality. In the case of porn, however, for every OPENING OF MISTY BEETHOVEN, there&apos;s at least a thousand TEENAGE CYCLE SLUTS. Be that as it may, most folks would probably agree that pretty much any old pornography is able to serve its intended purpose...\n\n...except, maybe, for one...\n\nBAT PUSSY was whipped-up circa 1970 by an as-yet unidentified personnel, and I don&apos;t foresee anyone stepping forward to atone for this magnolious coup-de-maître any time soon. The single known print moldered for decades in the musty back-room of a long-standing porn theater, where it was ultimately rediscovered in situ by mere chance. Now that it&apos;s been unleashed upon the world, this impossibly unarousing gutterball sinks the opposition for WORST PORNO OF ALL TIME accolades, a sash which it will undoubtedly wear for many years to come. Unsightly old cretins exchange spit-and-vinegar bellicosities while loitering drunkenly in loose-fitting birthday suits...that, friends, is the fatal thrust of BAT PUSSY, a stultifying avalanche of graveolent unerotica which will not only deter you from touching your nasty pudendum-virile, it will motivate you to saw the damn thing off with a steak knife. Watch in frozen terror as a gelatinous hambeast with a four-story beehive and world-weary, shoe gazing milk-bags goes down on a pugnacious old bogan so scuzzy that a Bangkok call girl would refuse to scrub his back. Her face is crimped in sour disinclination as she spit-shines his fetid, wilting knurl with all the tantric artistry of a dog eating peanut butter. He reciprocates with equal inertia, administering a lethargic consecution of flicks and nibbles with such cowering disrelish that you&apos;d think he was defusing a bomb with his tongue. Never in the history of blue cinema has the &quot;beast with two backs&quot; been quite so repellent...but I reckon that&apos;s to be expected when the participants despise each other and look like they should be ringing a bell in a tower.\n\nOn a slightly more positive note, there&apos;s the titular superheroine...she&apos;s three zip-codes away from hot, but I suppose she might do in a &quot;last call&quot; pinch. You&apos;d expect her outfit to be skintight and sexy, with a whiff of Emma Peel fetishism, right? Pffft...she sports a lumpy dime-store Halloween costume, bobbing about town on a huge rubber sit-and-bounce ball. The aforementioned characters eventually merge for an appetite suppressing menage-a-trois, replete with jiggling flab, erectile dysfunction, and conjoint lack of interest. To top things off, it&apos;s crudely shot on grainy, cut-rate filmstock which makes the Zapruder footage look hi-def by comparison.\n\nThere&apos;s a cringeworthy otherness innate to this smutty side-show which is as strangely compelling as it is potently miasmic. It compounds the interpersonal animus of SHUT UP, LITTLE MAN, the mirror-shattering visual pestilence of GUMMO, and a rancorous surrealism resonant of early John Waters projects. If it spurs any stiffness in your tonk, chalk it up to rigor-mortis.\n\n5/10. In summary, BAT PUSSY is utterly rebarbative adult entertainment with the Plutonian sapor of a Diane Arbus photo, and it&apos;s wrought with less artistic refinement than a snuff loop from El Salvador. Hold your nose and dive in."

Furthermore one has the feeling that the makers were forcing themselves to make a cult film, and that always falls through.\n\nBel Ami 2000 is after 33 years certainly not 2000-proof.",

      "reviewBody": "Given the commercial and critical success of director Dany Boon&apos;s earlier film Welcome to the Sticks, it is peculiar that his next project, Nothing to Declare, endured a straight-to-DVD release in France. This is despite its superb sense of humour, engaging interplay between characters and generally fun, light-hearted feel. \n\nThe story, set in 1993, centres on the racist, trigger-happy Belgian Ruben (Benoit Poelvoorde), who is paired up against his will with Frenchman Mathias (Boon) in their effort to police the Franco-Belgian border. Compounding the strenuous partnership is the fact that Mathias is secretly dating overprotective Ruben&apos;s sister (Julie Bernard). Also intertwined in the story is the oafish Jacques and trying wife Irene, who turn to smuggling contraband between the borders to make ends meet, as well as the world&apos;s most incompetent drug ring and their short-tempered boss.\n\nRight off the bat, it&apos;s clear that Boon has a talent for ensemble directing. Although he and Poelvoorde share the lead, each fringe character enjoys ample screen time to tell their story and draw audience engagement, while all potential loose ends are appropriately tied up without leaving any individual&apos;s fate hanging in the balance.\n\nHumour is consistent throughout Nothing to Declare. Following a slow start, the film employs varying instances of physical, visual and verbal comedy, the latter of which is accentuated by the consistently tense, tight interplay between certain pairs of characters. The arguable highlight occurs as the criminals attempt to disguise their van as an ambulance for the purpose of drug smuggling, but honourable mentions must also go to Ruben&apos;s crude, xenophobic dad and the &apos;pimping-out&apos; of Mathias&apos;s patrol car.\n\nBoon casually addresses the fine line between patriotism and racism with this film but, like all good comedies, it permits pure entertainment to take priority, without falling into the trap of becoming too preachy, political or divisive.\n\n*There&apos;s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you&apos;re looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I&apos;d also love to hear from you.*",

      "reviewBody": "Love Phobia is standard formula stuff: it&apos;s cute and funny for an hour and then makes you cry for another hour without dashing your hopes for a happy ending. It&apos;s executed extremely well with quirky bits throughout. If you like this kind of movie this is a grand slam home run. It&apos;s an interesting allegory as well but I don&apos;t want to give away too much.\n\nLove Phobia is about a girl, Ari, who claims she has a curse and that bad things will happen to anyone who touches her. She also claims to be an alien. The film starts off with her as an elementary school kid who befriends a young boy, Jo-Kang. After he touches her one day he comes down with the measles. Ari mysteriously disappears the next day. Ten years later she reappears just as mysteriously in Jo-Kang&apos;s life, and then disappears again. Ten years later, or so, she returns to Jo-Kang again and her true story unfolds.\n\nHye-jeong Kang plays Ari as a teenager and as a young woman. She is not only cute beyond words, she&apos;s one of Korea&apos;s best young actresses. This is something that sets Korean melodramas apart, they use real actors and actresses instead of flavor of the month idols. From &quot;The Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Oldboy&quot; to this, with a half dozen well-received films in between, including the controversial and complicated &quot;Rules of Dating&quot; ... Hye-jeong Kang, at just twenty-six, is on a roll. Seung-woo Cho is also very good as Jo-Kang. Both are convincing as teenagers and as young adults, a testament to the Korean epidermis, perhaps, as much as thespian prowess.",

      "reviewBody": "PLENTY cast such a spell on me. It is one of those films which has a mood and tone all of its own. It is sombre, dreamy and elegaic. And it features a little seen, yet compelling and masterful central performance from Meryl Streep, who lights up the screen with the type of intelligence and female strength one laments the absence of in contemporary film.\n\nBased on David Hare&apos;s play, PLENTY (like so much of his work) boasts wonderfully complex, multi-layered roles for women. Meryl Streep and Tracey Ullmann excel with the intelligent dialogue given to them by this incredible writer - and despite the plethora of strong male actors surrounding them, it is the women whose stories move and interest us the most.\n\nWhat I love about PLENTY is that so much about it is anti-Hollywood. Its convoluted plot is often incoherent and dreamlike, its dependence upon memories and the co-existence of past and present present challenges for audiences who normally would be sign posted in the &apos;correct&apos; direction. It has an impressionistic, hypnotic feel, and the film&apos;s characters, especially Susan, are unappologetic and potentially dislikeable people. Its narrative resoultion is ambiguous, refusing the closure of more traditional dramas. Here we have a film which refuses to pander to the demands of the mainstream, and for that it is to be applauded.\n\nIs there anything new that any of us can say about Meryl Streep??? This is a must for admirers of the actress, and a must for anyone with a penchant for riveting, deeply intelligent acting. Meryl grabs the part by the throat, investing Susan with a compelling defiance, a fierce intelligence, a sensuality, and a restrained beauty. Watch out for the dinner party scene. I forgot there was anyone else in the room (a room which included Sir John Gielgud and Charles Dance!) Such command, such depth, and such naturalness. This is an actress of phenomenal depth and magnificent expression. And such wonderful chemistry with the other actors! (Even Charles Dance who reportedly was a bit of a diva on set!! I wonder if this helped to enhance the fiery antagonsim between them on screen?)\n\nIn sum, PLENTY is deeply complicated, but give it time, watch it more than once and you will be rewarded. For its thoughtful direction, its searing, intricate dialogue and its mesmerising acting - this is a film that deserves to be seen by much larger audiences. Bravo Queen Meryl!!",

Years have passed since his death but people won&apos;t stop worshipping him since he established himself as a real cult figure. This documentary emphasizes the immense creativity of Jackson and his timeless music. It&apos;s easy to understand how he has always had free access to the heart of billions of people including all his colleagues and employees. The truth of his greatness is palpable throughout the documentary, which is able to immerse the audience in the massive hysteria of the 80s that surrounded Michael Jackson. &quot;Bad 25&quot; was made by people who truly cared about Michael and his art and it shows.\n\nThe documentary also focuses on the work ethic of the superstar and how he set the unachievable standards of the music industry.\n\nIf you are looking for a great piece of the history of Michael Jackson &apos;Bad 25&apos; is the answer.",

A bit talky at first, but gains momentum as picture goes on. Lush scenery, although some process shots look...well like process. Peter Finch is good as the head of the tea plantation and is a bit ruthless at times. Good guy Dana Andrews shows up as a good romantic interest when needed. Whom will Liz end up with? The elephant stampede at the end is well worth the price of admission. By the way, the DVD transfer is great. Worth a look just to see the 50&apos;s style filming..No sex, violence, foul language.

The storyline is a bit different, yet will be instantly recognisable to millions of Indians living in joint families much influenced by their elders! And also about pride, and resentment and ultimately regret and forgiveness.\n\nMusic is good and well-integrated into the film; in fact a turning point of the plot is during one of the songs. Dialogue is characteristically Bedi, who spurned the more melodramatic tendencies of a lot of films and Phagun has characters talking in his direct and down-to-earth, realistic conversational style.\n\nIt is certainly good family entertainment and recommended to all who like our Hindi films to be a little less absurd. Director Rajinder Singh Bedi contributed to some quality writing in Indian cinema through films like Madhumati or Abhimaan. If you like this, also watch his other directorial venture, Dastak.",

Both Hanks&apos; and Ryan&apos;s &quot;unsuitable&quot; partners appear to be perfectly nice people, yet the movie casually dismisses them over one little flaw apiece--the woman laughs like a hyena and the man has terrible allergies. Both characters behave very well, considering the way they&apos;re treated by others. Hanks&apos; girlfriend in particular desires a medal for putting up with his brat of a son, who is rude to her at every opportunity.\n\nI also had difficulty warming to Hanks&apos; son, although he is certainly preferable to the young girl who keeps expressing everything in initials.\n\nOn the bright side, there are many engaging supporting characters, including Rob Reiner as a fellow architect. Also of note are the rich homeowner, the dotty babysitter and Rosie O&apos;Donnell as Ryan&apos;s editor and friend. Thankfully, few to none of their scenes involve the annoying children.\n\nMany of the jokes are funny, the best coming when Hanks and a friend ridicule the weepy reaction of many women to &quot;chick flicks&quot; by sobbing as they recount the plot of &quot;The Dirty Dozen.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "A bunch of American army boys waste away their time at camp, horsing around and yelling obscenities at each other while they wait their next posting. The style is gritty and raw. There are no Hollywood glamour shots of pretty boy stars, Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum or Joseph Gordon-Levitt; there is just confusion over where their day is headed. Before long, the team is manning a road blockade. Director Kimberly Pierce keeps the framing and the editing tight in this opening sequence and shoots the intensity high into the clear-blue, Iraq sky. Each car that approaches the young, scattered soldiers could be a disaster. One second they&apos;re lusting over a girl back home, the next they find themselves in the middle of a full- on ambush. The lot of them all fall into line and show what good soldiers are made of  boys that become men in a moment&apos;s notice without thinking. And then they fight. Moves are made in as calculated a fashion as is allowed in the back alleys of a foreign land. Some of the men live and some die fighting. Within minutes, STOP-LOSS has you and then without warning, the film suddenly turns into a hip-hop musical montage, establishing the stop- and-start pulse of the film that ultimately leaves it for a loss.\n\nIt has been nearly ten years since Pierce made her fearless directorial debut with BOYS DON&apos;T CRY. It was a commanding assault on the viewer&apos;s nerves with each scene building panic and mounting anxiety. You were never given a chance to breathe and the tragic story it told became unforgettable as a result. This is why it is all so strange to see her impose breaks upon the viewer. Not only does it grind the flow to a halt in the dirt but it also exposes the need to repackage the current wave of Iraq war themed films. On the one hand, it makes some sense to cut the film together in an MTV-inspired style to market the war to the generation that is actually fighting it (it should also be noted that the film is MTV produced). On the other hand though, this approach subsequently comes across as a compromised version of Pierce&apos;s potential vision. That said, perhaps the new design is necessary in order to get the film&apos;s important message across and heard.\n\nThe message in this latest condemnation of the Iraq war effort is to bring attention to the &quot;stop-loss&quot; process. The term itself refers to the army&apos;s right to force soldiers into another tour of duty at the end of the term they voluntarily signed up for. It is only supposed to be invoked when the war is still ongoing so you can imagine the outrage felt by Brandon King (Phillippe) as he is expecting to be signing his discharge papers and is told instead that he is shipping back to Iraq. Infuriated by his government&apos;s backdoor approach to get around the lack of a draft, Brandon goes AWOL in search of a way out. While taking advantage of the soldiers that enlisted freely to fight for their country is appalling enough, it becomes even more so when you see how messed up the returning soldiers have become after balancing being boys and being men in such devastating situations. Pierce&apos;s subtle presentation of the young men of Middle America is smart enough not to exaggerate their psychological damage but their table manners speak volumes to make her point. These are men who cannot carry on a conversation without recounting atrocious experiences they suffered through and have no concept of how uncomfortable they are making everyone around them. Another tour of duty could reasonably crush them if it doesn&apos;t kill them. With that in mind, Brandon&apos;s escape is not just warranted but imperative.\n\nAt one point, Brandon makes a homecoming speech to the people of his Texas town. Midway, he is overwhelmed by how much he has been affected by the simple sights and smells of his home and he cannot go on. Everything he was fighting for becomes clear to him but a fellow officer interrupts his speech in favor of a more crowd-rousing message. People don&apos;t want to face the reality of the war; they just want to hear that their side is winning. And while Pierce&apos;s point is important and still firmly made, it is impossible to feel as if this film that took so many years to make is actually the film she intended and not a film that was designed to profit from a specific market. Still, it is worth applauding for providing a product that will be most enjoyed and appreciated by the demographic that is actually fighting on the front lines as opposed to an older generation that until now has been able to just sit back in the theatre and quietly criticize the war from afar.",

Proof that she was a great poser, and a lousy dancer, but as she has said herself, she was &quot;far from being a professional dancer&quot;. She is very appealing despite the fact that neither my husband nor myself could contain our raucous laughter during her dance scenes. Her sparkle and sense of fun are evident throughout, she is in great shape, and her ever-changing and playful facial expressions are absolute treats to see. \n\nPlus! You get to &quot;Hear Bettie speak!&quot; in addition to seeing her jump around - uhhm I mean dance. \n\nThe best part of the DVD is a silent, black and white arcade film loop of Bettie created for those old-time coin-activated peep-show viewers....Bettie gyrates up to a point, then the screen is suddenly blocked out with a caption telling the viewer to insert coins to see more of the film. This of course occurs at a regular basis through this particular short, as it did when those types of films were originally shown. Classic camp!\n\nThere are also appearances by a rather famous, albeit scary-looking drag queen from the time, and some professional strippers who could have passed for drag queens...but I bought these really just for the Bettie Page segments; these two DVD&apos;s are a must-have for Bettie Page fans."

That&apos;s a good thing for a horror film because not too many really disturb me. It has become one of my favorite horror films, and the reason for this is that it has such an original story, memorable characters, and it doesn&apos;t care who it grosses out! From the few people who hated this movie, they&apos;re obviously weak-stomached or perhaps even members of &quot;Society&quot;???\n\nIf you can&apos;t stand bizarre horror movies in the vein of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deranged, Hellraiser 1 and 2, Motel Hell, etc... then you probably will not enjoy this film...especially the last half hour. This is not for every audience and clearly doesn&apos;t pretend to be.\n\nI&apos;ve owned the video for years and recently also bought the Unrated DVD, i must say it is great finally having a very clear picture and sound...in it&apos;s uncut form! They just don&apos;t make many shockingly good horror flicks like this anymore..."

      "reviewBody": "Since this movie was covered fairly early on by the MST3000 crew (along with &quot;Rocketship XM&quot; and &quot;King Dinosaur&quot;), my initial perception of this movie was something on the lines of &apos;Ehhhh, pretty cheesy&apos;, although it was clearly one of the better films they covered. Undoubtedly I saw the chopped up 93 minute version, instead of the longer, more coherent original version mentioned by other reviewers. \n\nHowever, I saw a standalone DVD edition on sale at a clearance store and picked it up for a couple of bucks on some obscure impulse, and one fine evening I gave it a spin. \n\nYou know...in spite of the dated message and foreign cultural references and the problematic dubbing and &quot;Engrish&quot; translations, &quot;1st Spaceship To Venus&quot; does have a certain quality about it that I&apos;ve come to respect. There&apos;s a certain gravity and solemnity to the proceedings. There&apos;s a certain wildness and inventiveness to the art direction and the sound design. And while none of the actors here are going to win any awards (or even by remembered by American audiences), if you pay attention you will see humane, approachable performances (undercut by poor dubbing) that make the film much more watchable than glib junk like &quot;Rocketship XM&quot; or space flight oriented stuff out of the Roger Corman sausage factory. \n\nWhen I first saw &quot;1st Spaceship&quot;, I had the impression that it definitely had an East European vibe to it, and the only Slavic speculative fiction author I was familiar with was Stanislaw Lem (whose best known work is probably &quot;Solaris&quot;, although my favorite piece is &quot;Non Serviam&quot;). Sure enough, this movie turns out to be based on a Lem piece from decades back. Lem&apos;s dispassionate, Kabbalistic voice and speech rhythms, and his gift for oddly moving plots and characters somehow survived the adaptation to film and the tiny budget and the &quot;Engrish&quot; translation, leaving a dignity and substance to the proceedings that many contemporary American sci fi flicks can&apos;t match. \n\nNo, this will never be anyone&apos;s first choice for a space opera shoot-em-up, but under the crappy dubbing and hacked-up editing, the sympathetic eye can see that there is some good work being done here. A good item to add to the collection of the sci fi completist and archivist.",

How hot is she?. There are other aspects to consider like decent gore that looks like syrup, steamy sexual situations, cheesy rock music, and strange performances.\n\nThis isn&apos;t by means a movie I could recommend to you fellow Horror fans, I could only recommend it if you are into early 90&apos;s Horror (very peculiar).\n\nIf you can stand cheese and sleaze, this may please you.",

It&apos;s supposedly based on a true story (but aren&apos;t they always?) about a family who encounter a particularly nasty spook in their house.\n\nThis is a film where I can find many positives and only one negative. The good things are the setting (if you ignore the occasional Sky Digital dish in the background). They do a good job of portraying seventies England. The actors are also all believable. The film centres quite a bit on two young girls. Kids in films (and especially horror films) tend to be either highly annoying, or just totally unlikeable. However, I found these two girls quite endearing and hopefully they will have a long acting career ahead of them. Also, it&apos;s quite creepy. The scares are sometimes predictable, but they&apos;re there nonetheless.\n\nAbout the only thing that&apos;s negative is that - as far as story-telling goes - is that there&apos;s nothing new here. Hollywood has been churning out these sorts of films for years and all you have here is a British (period) version of one of those types.\n\nIf you&apos;re in the mood for an easy-going British horror flick, definitely give this one a go. Just don&apos;t expect anything revolutionary.",

      "reviewBody": "Half Ticket is a laugh riot. An absolute classic from Kishore Kumar and director Kalidas.\n\nHalf ticket is the story of Vijay(Kishore Kumar) who is a fun loving son of a rich industrialist. He is always doing some pranks. His father becomes fade up of his pranks and habits, drives him out of the house. He then decides to go to mumbai but he does not have money for ticket. He them disguise himself as a crazy little boy who is half witted. At railway station a thief Raja Babu(Pran) hides a dimond in Munna&apos;s hip in bid to escape from police. And the rest of the story is how Raja Babu tries to retrieve his diamond from Munna while Munna/Vijay and Rajini comes close to each other.\n\nThis movie&apos;s biggest strength lies in the lead actor Kishore Kumar, and he ensures this is one man&apos;s show. He is simply brilliant in each frame. Absolutely crazy act and you will just love the accent and speech tone of Kishore Kumar.\n\nMadhubala looks lovely and both of them KK and Madhubala looking so good together. Both of them have amazing chemistry together and even their scenes are crazy ones.\n\nDirector Kalidas ensures there is no any dull moment in the movie. An absolutely crazy movie which is fun to watch.",

I rented it because a friend recommended it, but I knew little about it, and I know it played in theaters in fall 1998 for under 2 weeks.\n\nThen I watched it.\n\nI was really into this movie. It kept me wondering about all of the characters and it had a really good mysterious, dark and kinda funny atmosphere the whole time. What stood out the most was Vince Vaughn&apos;s character: Not since Jeffrey Combs in The Frighteners (my second favorite film of all time) has there been such a strange/hilarious intentions-completely-unknown-till-the-end character and you don&apos;t know whether to laugh at him or to be afraid of him. Terrific! The other characters in this freaky town the film takes place in are all superb, too. Sarcastic, hilarious, white-trash everywhere you look!\n\nThe film is great on a murder mystery level, great on a thriller level and good on a comedy level, and is never boring for a second. Rent it now, but I&apos;ll put out a warning: The movies soundtrack (100% country) will not thrill everyone.\n\n8.5 out of 10. (It deserves 9, but that&apos;s what I gave Frighteners and that film was better)."

Â“Good HairÂ” and other Dubious Distinctions is a film which attempts to incite meaningful conversation.  The film is well paced and beautifully shot.  Interview segments are juxtaposed against footage of the filmmaker as she prepares for the birth of her third child challenging the viewer to admit to the common practice of mapping Â“desirableÂ” traits unto unborn children.  Through personal stories, historical discussion and sociological analysis the film functions as a critique. A loving one which offers a message of strength and hope in the face of cultural practices which work to damage the self-esteem, and possibly, life chances of those whose physical characteristics have been defined as less desirable by their family, friends and neighbors.

      "reviewBody": "The dance with the devil based on novelist László Krasznahorkai&apos;s novel about the aftermath of the fall of communism for sure has to rank very high up when it gets to unconventional motion pictures. Filmed in beautiful black and white by Hungarian director Béla Tarr in the early Nineties, the movie consists of twelve parts and lasts seven and a half hours with single tracking shots up to ten minutes, often with very little or only repetitive action on screen. And it rains and rains and rains. Make no mistake: Despite its length Satantango is not an epic narration, but rather achieves long lasting impressions by pointing the camera on banalities inspired by the bleakness of the scenery, perfectly enhanced by the director&apos;s choices what to show and how to show it in order to induce a trance-like reaction in the viewer. And while doing so Satantango mesmerizes, shocks, devastates, enthralls.\n\nThe time line is a bit unclear and episodes overlap or could have happened the same way at another time. Yet there is a main thread of story about a con-man in the messiah&apos;s disguise, a seemingly eternally lasting dance in the very middle, and an essential episode about a little girl representing the core of the film - a symbol of the disillusionment and victim of betrayal, desperately searching for ways to exert some power herself in her forlorn reality. Not that much is happening in Satantango, and some things remain vague, but reality is also transcended at key points adding to the allegorical impact. The aesthetics of the experience and its ultimate conclusion will remain with those who are open for it.",

Despite this, &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; certainly does bring another high-quality piece of family entertainment to the big screen.\n\nSurprisingly, the film&apos;s story is quite strong. Based on the retro cartoon of the same name, &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; centers on a highly intelligent dog named Mr. Peabody (excellently voiced by Modern Family star, Ty Burrell) who adopts a young boy named Sherman (also excellently voiced by 8-year-old Max Charles). Peabody takes Sherman on adventures through time with his super advanced time machine known as the &quot;Way Back&quot;. After a series of incidents, the duo must travel to different time periods and eventually have to fix a potential hole in the space time continuum. \n\nMany recent films based on retro cartoons (such as the abysmal &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; and &quot;Smurfs&quot; films) have failed to provide a good screenplay to accompany its animated hijinks. This film, however, is packed with witty dialogue and good morals about unconventional families, fatherhood, and childhood struggles. Mr. Peabody and Sherman are surprisingly deep characters. The fact that Sherman has been raised by a dog does eventually cause a rift between the two. In the beginning of the movie, Sherman is teased at school and called a &quot;dog&quot; because his father is one. Also faced with his own maturing, Sherman wishes to do more things on his own. Peabody, meanwhile is apprehensive of Sherman doing things on his own, as he fears inside that Sherman will outgrow him. This is quite a lot of conflict for a &quot;kid&apos;s movie.&quot;\n\nLuckily, the thematic elements are interspersed with charming humor and exciting visuals. Each time period is filled with beautifully animated landscapes and enjoyable characters with top-notch vocal performances. In 18th century France, Marie Antoinette (voiced by Lauri Fraser) is portrayed as a bubbly, naive, cake-obsessed aristocrat who is constantly stuffing her face with dessert. In ancient Egypt, palm trees, pyramids and towering statues show a clear rose gallery of effort from the animation team.\n\nIt&apos;s also worth pointing out that this film has some of the finest voice acting I have ever heard in an animated feature. Ty Burrell and Max Charles bring believable emotion and jocularity to Peabody and Sherman respectively. Burrell gives Peabody a suitably intellectual and clear sounding voice, giving an extra jolt of likability to the character. Max Charles shows an excessive amount of talent for an 8- year-old (probably younger when the dialogue was recorded), making Sherman a believable young boy with a roller-coaster of emotions throughout. An all-star supporting cast including Steve Colbert, Ariel Winter, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton, Dennis Haysbert, Allison Janney, Leslie Mann and even Mel Brooks are certainly a treasure to listen to as well.\n\nIn regards to its historical accuracy, though this film does certainly have its share of jarring anachronisms (such as heart-printed underwear and an actual working flying machine made by Leonardo da Vinci), there is certainly a decent amount of informative elements in the historical scenes. Kids may actually be delighted to learn about how Marie Antoinette helped ignite the French Revolution and how George Washington didn&apos;t really cut down a cherry tree. The film makes the wise decision of being a colorful family adventure film while still having some informative elements. LA Times&apos; film critic Betsey Sharkey recently criticized this movie for being &quot;too smart for its own good,&quot; saying: &quot;Mr. Peabody&apos;s &quot;teaching moments&quot; will sail right over the heads of kids while requiring adults to pay attention.&quot; With all due respect, Ms. Sharkey, I feel like the &quot;teaching moments&quot; are what make this movie stand out from other family fare. The fact that the filmmakers bring some education to the screenplay really shows that they have faith in a kid&apos;s ability to watch a movie.\n\nIn all fairness, one common criticism I do somewhat understand is the film&apos;s somewhat convoluted second act. Without giving anything away, I do have to admit things get pretty hectic. However, after many years of watching movies with time travel, I&apos;ve learned to put down my complaint notebook and enjoy the movie. Let&apos;s face it: it&apos;s pretty much a guarantee that a movie involving time travel will have at least a couple of plot holes. Even excellent time travel films like &quot;Looper&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot; have plot holes. However, those discussions are for another day.\n\nAt the end of the day, &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; is a beautiful, funny, and even heartfelt film that families from every background will get a kick out of. It is enjoyable to watch, and I dare even say it&apos;s one of Dreamworks&apos; best efforts to date.",

Geraldine Farrar is a little too much on the overacting side at stages, but she makes a passionate and fiery little Carmen who scratches and bites her way through life.  Wallace Reid is a charming Don Jose, driven mad with love to the tragic conclusion. The video version I saw has some Farrar arias tacked on with stills from the film, and the whole is extremely affecting.  Joan the Woman is better but this is still a fascinating little piece."

I really don&apos;t know whether the people from the West who aren&apos;t that familiar with Asian culture, that too the rural culture would really relate well to this movie. But I think it&apos;s one of the most interesting movies I&apos;ve ever seen, to be frank. I&apos;ve seen the rural life in India and kinda lived it a bit too and I was kinda really surprised by the similarity that I could find in this movie, be it regarding the gender bias or the illiteracy thing or the domestic violence that illiterate women have to tolerate and just live as if they are born to bear that kind of treatment from sadistic husbands.\n\nAs much as I was amazed from the similarity that I could find, I was spellbound by the kind of story telling that this movie was. You would never feel bored although the story goes at a very slow pace, although towards the end it gets to your nerves. The acting by every one of them is appreciable as you never feel that they are really just playing the character in the movie. \n\nI&apos;ve been watching Korean movies for a while now and have become a big fan of them since, and I certainly think this&apos;s one of the best among them. For those who have watched &apos;Oldboy&apos; or &apos;I Saw the Devil&apos;, you would know what&apos;s the kind of gory it would reach. It&apos;s truly &quot;Korean&quot;, in every way.\n\nIf you are a K-movie fan then you would certainly love this one! This one is going into &apos;My Collection&apos;!",

Right at the get go I&apos;m sold.\n\nMix in a bunch of action, cheesy effects and acted acting, drugs, dark themes and a kick ass weapon (a scoop net with a blade at the net and a knife at the end of the shaft) to name a few things and you get an in-your-face B-movie comedy.\n\nHow do you review a movie that constantly walks the lines of absolute balls to the wall comedy, constantly breaks the fourth wall and makes really bad puns? Well, like any other movie I would guess. But to be honest, this is one of the funniest movies that I&apos;ve seen in recent times. It&apos;s just stupid enough, and has more than enough intelligence to realize that it&apos;s stupid to make it enjoyable. The setup is amazing, and the ridiculousness of the setup to the movie makes it perfect as a B-movie. It shouldn&apos;t be considered a B-movie just because it has a low budget, the majority of the movie is actually funnier than a hundred new A-movies that has a lot of money attached to it. The writing really puts it over the top, kudos to Ross Pattersson.\n\nTo be even more honest a review doesn&apos;t even give this movie the praise that it deserves. Even though this movie has bad ratings it deserves a whole lot more credit than people are giving it, or rather denying it. Just watch it, broaden your perspective, bro.",

      "reviewBody": "The Good: This was an informative, compellingly structured documentary on the genesis and evolution of LA gangs. The story is told via an oral history by first generation gang members and then proceeds to unfold with more contemporary members (and ex-members). The film contains a high degree of advocacy (especially in the final 30 minutes) that seems reasonable.\n\nThe Not so Good: The director clearly lays the blame for gangs and gang violence on Caucasians. Although there is no disputing that institutionalized racism of slavery on up to the end of segregation definitely created gross economic and social injustices, the director fails to make a compelling case that whites directly caused inner city blacks to wage war on each other for decades. The director touches on some of the more salient factors, such as factory jobs (i.e. unskilled labor) opportunities disappearing, but fails to identify that as a root cause. Instead, we are presented with numerous examples of institutional and individual racism--including conspiracy theories involving Iran-Contra, J. Edgar Hoover, LAPD, et.al. Nowhere within this otherwise excellent documentary does the director touch on individual responsibility, personal morals, etc. Gang members (including murderers) are presented as victims of society. The director focuses much attention on the Black Panther and US movement of the 60s and 70s however this narrative is presented mostly to advance a conspiracy theory of how the FBI sought to destroy the groups, ultimately resulting in a lack of political power and community disarray. He goes on to try and blame the influx of drugs into the community as an orchestrated effort by Washington to fund the Contras.\n\nThis film is good and worth a viewing. It provides an interesting insight into the evolution of LA gangs as well as how some African Americans perceive history. Unfortunately the director focuses too much time on trying to shift blame away from the violent trigger-pullers who admittedly were, and are, his friends. He is trying to shape history in a way that absolves his community of responsibility for the violence in order to empower them to find a way out of that lifestyle. This film presents that case well (although not compelling to me); hopefully it will help the next generation steer clear of joining gangs."

      "name": "&quot;Man of the Year&quot; is a very good political thriller/comedy that will suffer at the box office because of its misleading marketing campaign.",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Man of the Year&quot; tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television show. On his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about. One day on his show, a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for President of the United States. After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for President and low and behold wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position. A funny yet serious political thriller ensues \n\nMan anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns. &quot;Man of the Year&quot; is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in-between its comedy routine.\n\nBut enough about marketing, lets get down to the film itself.\n\nI really liked &quot;Man of the Year&quot; even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. One of the many things I will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward. I really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it. Some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don&apos;t understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right.\n\n&quot;Man of the Year&quot; talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn&apos;t about candy coating them. I also think the whole political subplot, while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic. Also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed.\n\nAs far as acting goes, I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but I personally still think he is funny and he&apos;s a good serious actor as well. This is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. Also it&apos;s nice to see Lewis Black co-star in a decent film. Again I like Black when he appears on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful. This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them.\n\n&quot;Man of the Year&quot; was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who has brought us such films as &quot;Rain Man,&quot; &quot;Good Morning Vietnam,&quot; and &quot;Wag the Dog.&quot; Levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it. Like I said I know a lot of critics didn&apos;t like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but I thought it fit in nicely. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a fine job with this film.\n\nIn the end, don&apos;t go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you. It does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama. It&apos;s not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn&apos;t a typical Hollywood film. It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn&apos;t really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn&apos;t end the way I thought which made me happy. It&apos;s a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what&apos;s going to happen next. I think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing.",

It seems to portray some kind of Munich high society which German filmmakers love (f.ex. Rossini) but who no one else in Germany really cares about. Besides I doubt that it exists in the way they like to portray it. So what&apos;s the point then? What&apos;s the point... Good question which could sum up the experience one has by seeing this movie which is not good nor bad. And this is the worst kind of movie... A bad movie at least leaves the pleasure to make sarcastic comments... This one here... nothing...",

      "name": "Very good horror anthology by specialist company Amicus",
      "reviewBody": "The early 70&apos;s were golden years for the British horror industry Hammer produced their last goodies, while there was another company who specialized in making the so-called `horror-omnibuses&apos; During a reign of approximately 10 years, Amicus brought forward anthologies going from nearly brilliant (The House that Dripped Blood) to very bad (The Monster Club).  Tales From the Crypt surely belongs to their greatest achievements as well and it guarantees an hour and a half of delightful horror entertainment. Five stories are presented to us, and at least four of them have an above average quality level. (Sir) Ralph Richardson appears as the host. Disguised as the Cryptkeeper, he shows the unfortunate dead of 5 people who descended into his vault \n\nThe film is based on a fifties comic book success formula, which also resulted in a popular spin-off series in the early nineties. The protagonists are always doomed and these tales show their regress into death Each of the stories has its own, unique setting and atmosphere and, together, they cover pretty much all the favorite horror topics. Yet, 5 stories is a little exaggerated and therefore aren&apos;t fully elaborated\n\nEspecially the first story suffers from its own shortnessIt involves a bitchy woman (a stunningly beautiful Joan Collins) who kills her husband, but finds herself trapped in her house while an escaped lunatic lurks through the windows. This first story is pretty bloody and tense, and I wish it had been a little longer (if it were only to look at Collins some more). The second story by far is the worst of them all and I feel they should have left this one out. The storyline has nothing new to offer and the acting is uninspired. Tale number three stars horror-legend Peter Cushing and he&apos;s the good guy for a change! Cushing is a lonely man who offers presents to the neighborhood children and throws parties for themI guess this wasn&apos;t an issue in the seventies yet! Or was it? Cushing character is hated by his next-door neighbor, but eventually avenges himself. The fourth story is my personal favorite since it really breathes an almost unbearable morbidityit&apos;s a variant on the famous monkey-claw myth, which provides the owner with 3 wishes. This chapter is really chilling and the scenery is great! It also has the best make-up effects and adorable twisted humor! The final story is very ingenious and chilling as well and it entirely takes places in an institute for the blind. The new manager introduces a whole lot of economy measures, while he&apos;s living a life of luxury. At one point, the inhabitants won&apos;t take it anymore and they show him what being blind feels like",

      "reviewBody": "I would expect a movie directed by John Malkovich to be intense and specific. The Dancer Upstairs is that. It is a political movie that while popular in Europe, does not tend to draw well in the United States. Too bad.\n\nThe story tells the tale of a lawyer who has left the law looking for a better system. I don&apos;t know that becoming a police detective is that much better, but it serves the story. The story is set in a nameless Latin American country -- which also suits the story line.\n\nDetective Lt. Agustín Rejas (Javier Bardem) has left a law firm where he was a junior partner, to join law enforcement -- with a conscious. He can give a break to a traveler whose papers are not quite right and he can be relentless in his pursuit of a terrorist.\n\nRejas has been victimized by the politics of his country. His father lost his coffee farm to the soldiers. His view of the judicial system has seen a rapist become president of the country. But still, Rejas finds joy in his beautiful dancer daughter and his wife -- who has a political mission of her own. Then he meets the free spirited dance instructor for his daughter.\n\nRejas works in a corrupt society where the fiscal corruption goes hand in hand with the moral and political corruption. The central government is all too ready to suspend civil rights and to put military law into effect. The military killing innocent people is fine as long as it suits the party.\n\nRejas attempts to live the just life and must deal with the corruption the best he can. This conflict is the heart of the movie. As he says, he has feelings about his father losing his farm and he is the Gary Cooper type.\n\nJavier Bardem is excellent in the pivotal role. Juan Diego Botto does a very credible job as Detective Sgt. Sucre.  Laura Morante is intoxicating as dance instructor focal point of the story.\n\nI give this move a 9 for great story and suspense, excellent direction and fine acting. There is no sex and very brief nudity. The violence does tend to be horrific and there are depictions of cruelty to animals -- both central to the plot. This is far less than the typical Jason or Chainsaw movies gore.\n\nI consider this an excellent direction debut for John Malkovich and look forward to his next feature film effort. It feels like Malkovich will fill a role similar to Robert Redford in films he has directed.",

      "reviewBody": "In Afghanistan, during the Taliban regime, women are forbidden to work and to walk on the streets without the company of a male. The teenager girl Osama (Marina Golbahari) cuts her hair and dresses like a boy to get a job and support her widow mother and grandmother. There is no men in her family, since her father and her brother were killed in previous Afghan wars, and the family has no means of survival. When Osama, disguised as a boy, is called by the Taliban to join the school and military training, the boy Espandi (Arif Herati) tries to help her.\n\n&quot;Osama&quot; is a spectacular film, based on true events, and the interpretation of the amateurish cast is so perfect that sometimes the movie looks like a documentary. It is amazing how different from Western cultures is the life, religion, streets, houses of the Afghan people, and how repressed the women are in this evil system. Although being aware of many atrocities of this fanatical power, through articles in newspapers and magazines, this movie is so real and impressive that makes the viewer feel in the skin the difficulties of the life of this poor people. This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban. In accordance with the interview of the director Siddiq Barmak in the Extras of the DVD, Marina Golbahari was accidentally discovered four days before the beginning of the shootings. The girls had never watched a movie in a theater, and did not have a TV. Two days before the beginning of the shootings, Barmak met Arif Herati, and decided to create a special character for him, not foreseen in the original screenplay. The boy requested the director to buy his dogs to accept the invitation. This movie was awarded many international prizes, among them the Golden Globe (Best Movie),Golden Camera (Cannes Festival) and Best Movie (London Festival), and certainly deserves to be among the IMDb Top 250. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Osama&quot;",

I wish they would put it out on VHS or DVD as it is a very funny movie about an American girl who goes to a Sicilian village and becomes the scandal of the town because all the women are sure that she is plotting to be with their husbands. Father Antonio is the town priest who is very funny. Jessica, the American girl, rides around on a motorbike which is very scandalous for a their small village. If they ever put this movie out on VHS or DVD be sure to see it if you have Sicilian or Italian ancestry, or if you just want to laugh a lot.",

The writer-director Bahram Tavakoli has skilfully &amp; successfully changed the setting to Iran. The characters though are unmistakably Williamsian: dreamers trying to escape from the harsh realities of life. The mother (Fatemeh Motamed-Aria) dreams of finding a husband for her crippled daughter (Negar Javaherian). Her son, &amp; the main breadwinner in the family (Saber Abar) hates his job in a warehouse &amp; really wants to be a poet. He spends most of his free time at the movies. When, at his mother&apos;s behest, he invites his best mate (Parsa Pirouzfar) to dinner at their house, it appears that a suitor may have been found for his sister.\n\nHere Without Me showcases an acting master class. All the actors are excellent but the two female leads are outstanding (Motamed-Aria won the best actress award at Montreal Film Festival). Though it is difficult to escape the film&apos;s theatrical origins, on the whole this is a very successful adaptation which compares favorably with the best Hollywood adaptations of Williams&apos;s works. Recommended."

He is just about to end his crime career and turn into a laid-back life with a future millionaire Italian wife , Antonella Arnaldo (Erika Blanc), and a career as Formula 1 driver . But then he is being forced from Einstein (Fernando Sancho) to do a final job . As Tony Carrera, is forced to accept one last robbery at Amsterdam , on the eve of his marriage to the wealthy heir . As Tony has to carry out a heist at a fortress guarded by the army and where he must steal a mysterious suitcase . Instead of breaking into the vault from the outside, Tony hides inside the vault and take the target. After that, it happens many car chases and intrigue and he eventually arranges to get away with &quot;the secret plans&quot; . Along the way , Tony is chased by Comisario van Heuven (Antonio Casas) , and his Italian fiancée goes after him .\n\nCo-production Spain-West Germany (FRG)-Italy; Cinematografica Associati (CI. AS.), Hape-Film Company GmbH, Moncayo Films . Typical Euro spy movie with regular ingredients : thrills , noisy action , fights and helicopters . Our valiant , easy-going playboy/driver/thief takes on a powerful criminal organization while pull off a risked robbery and subsequently , being mercilessly pursued . Euro spy movie with usual tippings : car pursuits , crashes , chases throught the famous Amsterdam canals, strange artifacts , simple helicopters and explosive women . It has some flaws and gaps , as it does tend to get a bit old , including repetitive nature of some pursuit scenes , but it has big fun , so it cares . Thomas Hunter gives a passable acting as a brave robber in his last dangerous mission . Hunter has a bon vivant air about him that makes him great to see . Co-stars two Eurotrash starletts such as Erika Blanc and Gila von Weitershausen who today continues to act regularly for German television .Along with a plethora of familiar Spanish/Italian/German secondaries , usual in Euro-spy , Spaghetti or Peplum , such as : Walter Barnes , Fernando Sancho , Antonio Casas , Oscar Pellicer , Alberto Farnese , Gérard Tichy , Enzo Fiermonte , Frank Oliveras , Franco Ressel , among others .\n\nIt packs a cololorful and atmospheric cinematography in Panavision and Eastmancolor , though a perfect remastering being really necessary because the image is washed-out , photographed by cameraman Victor Monreal in terrific locations from Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands , Enkhuizen, Noordzeekanaal, Noord-Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands , Milan, Lombardia, Monza, Milan, Lombardia, Roma, Lazio, Italy , Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. And a thrilling musical score in the seventies style by composer composer Gianni Marchetti . The motion picture was regular wriitten/produced but professionally directed by José Antonio De La Loma , and it definitively worth checking out if you are a fan of Euro spy genre . Loma was a craftsman and real creator of ¨Quinqui sub-genre¨ . As Jose Antonio De La Loma , in his usual botcher style , filmed the successful trilogy : ¨Perros Callejeros I , II¨ and ¨Ultimos Golpes Del Torete¨ and he even made a female version : ¨Perras Callejeras . His style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog and attempted to take a position in favor of outcast people . Jose Antonio De La Loma chose young and natural actors as Angel Fernandez Franco ¨Torete¨ and Bernard Seray who played their parts to the hilt , unafraid of filmmaker&apos;s unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters . In ¨Perros Callejeros¨ series we see their troubles growing in such streets , slums or &quot;barrios&quot; from Barcelona and outskirts and other coastal places and some fine locations . In these films Jose Antonio De La Loma showed the ugliness of those &quot;barrios&quot; , toughness and cold existence . In his youthful De La Loma worked as a teacher in the Chinese barrio of Barcelona and he lived poorness and isolation . As he hired true delinquents who used their peculiar slang and particular behaves , all of them give a certain realism to these offbeat films . ¨Tres Dias De Libertad¨ was absurdly directed by Juan Antonio De La Loma who had a long career including titles as a writer and a filmmaker in all kinds of genres , as Western : ¨Professional for a massacre¨ ,¨Texas Kid¨ ,¨Clint the solitary¨ , ¨Return of Clint¨, ¨The last Mohican¨, ¨Seven pistols for Timothy¨ , ¨Viva Carrancho¨, ¨The Boldest job in the West¨, ¨Blood at sundown¨or ¨Porque Seguir Matando¨ and Action : ¨Metralleta Stein¨ , ¨Razzia¨ , ¨Explosion¨ , Squadron: Counterforce¨or &quot;Playing with Death&quot; , ¨Goma 2¨ , ¨Tony Carrera¨, &quot;Playboy to Kill&quot; and several others.",

I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There&apos;s a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don&apos;t do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn&apos;t have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that&apos;s love, er, actually. Nice little film.",

This tribute to her reflects his emotional farewell to her through the medium they both loved, and includes a powerful montage of moments from some of her films (like The Ascent)... which in Klimov&apos;s hands becomes part of his overwhelming testament of loss. You can almost feel his tears on each frame of this film, which is a moving work of art in it&apos;s own right. Larissa is never self indulgent, and manages to be private and public, sad and, somehow, glorious at the same time.\n\nAlongside Come and See, this is probably Klimov&apos;s best - and certainly most personal- film.",

Not only is it not funny, but also the whole situation seems stupid and the &quot;conflict&quot; almost nonexistent: having married for the second time, a gentleman and his young wife prepare for their wedding night. All of a sudden, while the bride is changing in her chambers, the first wife drops in, and refuses to leave. She threatens to scream (tough, isn&apos;t it?), and to avoid this, the hubby immediately turns to jelly and begins hiding the woman in the house. There&apos;s a lot of forced confusion and secrecy for the first half of the film, and nothing very interesting in the second. The viewer is left wondering, why the hell doesn&apos;t the 6&apos;4&apos;&apos; hunk just tell the bitch from hell to go back from where she came from, but instead starts acting like a nervous little schoolgirl. Somewhat weird editing (illogically inserted closeups) doesn&apos;t make things run any smoother. Ilse Werner, who showed talent as both a versatile actress and a musical star during the WW II, hasn&apos;t much to do and seems herself rather bored. Some good interiors and handsome (albeit not very effective or comic) Curd Jürgens, also some forgettable songs at the beginning and the end. Pretty lame programmer, but helps pass 90 minutes or so if you like old films.",

The film is alert, full of action, we see a little Amsterdam, we see a little Hong Kong, there are some pursuits, many many shots, everything justified. What is missing? A beautiful girl!

      "reviewBody": "RELEASED IN 1975 and directed by Duccio Tessari, &quot;Zorro&quot; stars Alain Delon as a new Spanish governor in Mexican California in the 1820s. With the populace of Nueva Aragón under the oppressive rule of corrupt Colonel Huerta (Stanley Baker), the foppish governor becomes the masked adventurer, Zorro, to bring justice. Ottavia Piccolo plays the noble hottie; Enzo Cerusico Zorro&apos;s mute servant; and Moustache a bumbling fat bastage soldier.\n\nThe version I viewed cut out an entire half hour, so I might raise my rating if I eventually see the longer version. Nevertheless, there&apos;s enough good in the short version to make this colorful European rendition of Zorro worth catching if you like swashbuckling adventure flicks with joie de vivre (&quot;joy of living&quot;), like &quot;The Musketeer&quot; (2001), &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and, of course, &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998). \n\nI&apos;m familiar with protagonist Delon from a couple of his prior films, &quot;Texas Across the River&quot; (1966) and &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1971), where he struck me as a striking, charismatic actor; unfortunately, he&apos;s not well known in the USA. Regardless, he&apos;s just perfect for the role of Zorro. Meanwhile, Piccolo is mind-blowing as the honorable senorita. The closing elongated sword fight is possibly the best bout of fencing put to celluloid, next to the one at the end of &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995). \n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours (with a widely circulated 87 minute version) and was shot in Almería &amp; Madrid, Spain. WRITERS: Giorgio Arlorio (story) and Giorgio Arlorio (screenplay). \n\nGRADE: B",

      "reviewBody": "A crude primitive excuse for animation! This film was begun in 1942 and not completed and released until just months before Japan&apos;s capitulation. The Japanese had been attempting to perfect animation since the early 30&apos;s and by this time still hadn&apos;t a clue what the hell they were doing! I have a BG in animation and WWII. This story follows the Momotaro (peach boy) legend but updates it. He&apos;s the sole human on his side, yet they fight the Brits who are all human. The animation indicates that while the Japanese tried hard, they were still in the stone age as far as mastering animation. Look at the pans of the L3Y&apos;s taking off, look at the character turnarounds! Absolute disaster! In reality the taking of Singapore was accomplished by ground troops. Percival and his staff are laughably portrayed as horned demons as per the Momotaro legend. I think the print has been modified and updated. Only good as a curiosity.",

      "reviewBody": "This film features Laurel and Hardy in a very familiar plot. As is often the case, the boys go out to play and lie to the wives about it--with disastrous results. This type of situation was featured in several films made by the team (such as THEIR PURPLE MOMENT and BLOTTO) and was remade very closely in SONS OF THE DESERT. In fact, after Laurel and Hardy, this same plot was reworked on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and even &quot;The Flintstones&quot;! \n\nIn this film, Stan and Ollie go out for a good time and meet two ladies who eventually ask them back to their apartment. What they don&apos;t know is that the wives suspect the boys are playing around and one of the lady has a boyfriend who is a professional boxer! The wives actually catch them in the act but Stan and Ollie don&apos;t know it--and there is a very, very long segment where the boys make up lie after lie to explain themselves. This leads to an expectedly violent confrontation. The end was cute and repeated very closely in BLOCKHEADS. While there&apos;s a lot of familiar material in this short, it is very well done and funny.",

The same might be said of the film itself, which represents director Istvan Szabo&apos;s bid for a wider slice of international box office. Unfortunately, what begins as a mild but engaging Murphy&apos;s Law comedy (complete with labor disputes, political arguments, artistic conflicts and so forth) soon devolves into a phony feel-good melodrama, with all the comic frustrations of the early scenes jettisoned in favor of a predictably stormy off-stage romance between the conductor and his temperamental superstar diva (Glenn Close). A few incidental pleasures and an attractive, charismatic cast (presenting the entire European community in a fascinating microcosm) aren&apos;t enough to hide all the obvious shortcomings, including (but not limited to) shoddy lip-synching, unnecessary voice-over commentary, and the assumption that listening to Wagner is like dying and going to heaven.",

Also referred to as &quot;13&quot;, the title-switcheroo proved unlucky for everyone, maybe most especially Sharon Tate (who does look gorgeous and has one neat scene where she changes a toad into a dove). Tate wanders through the film in a passive fog, and is later the victim to a whip-snapper; she gets an &apos;introducing&apos; credit here, just as she did for 1967&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Make Waves&quot;, though neither film is memorable nor uses her adequately. Poor miscast David Niven has nasty bags under his eyes, and his repartee with old friend Deborah Kerr (brought in after Kim Novak was either let go or dropped out) has no nuances--they seem like strangers. ** from ****",

I&apos;m not gonna spoil anything about &quot;Death Note&quot;, but as you can imagine, as with every spin-off, you have one major character from &quot;Death Note&quot; appearing in this movie.\n\nThis character is none other than &quot;L&quot;. A mysterious but very funny character, with some very weird and funny addiction habits. I don&apos;t know if this spin-off is based on an anime too, but I can say, that apart from a really fresh and exciting beginning, this movie lacks many things from the original &quot;Death Note&quot; (series). The actor who plays &quot;L&quot; (the same guy who played him in Death Note too) is fantastic in his role depiction. True to his anime roots, but only as much as the story allows him to be.\n\nAnd there lies the problem. This movie is way too serious (a few absurd moments still exist) and way too dramatic. A shame then, that the thriller elements can&apos;t save the movie either. The best moments lie in the comedy or character (mostly L) bits, but even those can&apos;t save the movie entirely. My tip: Watch both &quot;Death Note&quot; movies and the anime series instead!",

      "reviewBody": "In 1819 a little steamboat named the Savannah crossed the Atlantic Ocean. It was something of an experiment, as no ship running on steam had ever crossed the Atlantic (this was only a dozen years after Robert Fulton made steamboat travel on American waterways possible). The Savannah ran out of wood before it reached America, and had to use sails to complete the voyage, but it is usually accredited as the first trans-Atlantic ocean liner. It&apos;s day was brief. The Savannah was wrecked in 1821.\n\nReally successful ocean steamship travel did not begin until 1837-39. The Savannah was considered an example of waste and futility. But while sail travel was still advancing between Europe and North America (it would not be until the 1830s to 1850s that sail travel reached it&apos;s apogee with Donald McKay&apos;s wonderful clipper ships) the success of steam travel in American waterways could not be ignored. The British were the ones who decided to return to what the Savannah pointed to - in 1837 the steamship &quot;Royal William&quot; successfully crossed the Atlantic from Great Britain. But it went to Canada, not America. Still the future of steam travel on the Atlantic was inevitable.\n\nThis film is about the first attempt to cross the Atlantic from Liverpool to New York City in 1837. Will Fyffe is the engineer who designs the steam engine and boat, with the assistance of Douglas Fairbanks. Fairbanks had been first mate to a sailing ship captained by George Bancroft, who is naturally not to happy about losing a good mate and watching a future rival transportation method. Fairbanks is also romancing Margaret Lockwood, Fyffe&apos;s daughter. The film follows the trials and tribulations of the Fyffe and Fairbanks, until they get their chance. When they meet with a breakdown in the ocean, and a violent storm the crisis of the movie arrives. I like this film, so I won&apos;t spoil how the crisis is overcome.\n\nOne curious point. The boat that Fyffe and Fairbanks build is captained by &quot;Lt. Roberts&quot; (of the British navy). In history &quot;Lt. Roberts&quot; was the captain of the steamship &quot;President&quot; which was the largest in the world in 1840 - 41. In 1841, when headed for England, the &quot;President&quot; disappeared forever near Nantucket shoals off Massachusetts. It had over 100 people on board (a large number at the time) including Lt. Roberts. Lord Charles Lennox, son of the Duke of Lennox, was also lost, as was his close friend the actor Tyrone Power (the great grandfather of the movie star of the 1930s-1958)."

A madman is running around at night and killing people just for kicks. We follow the main characters who are at a mansion and start to become victim to the madman. Soon Professor Arthur Hornsby (who is working on a serum to revive the dead) will marry the pretty Mary Rinehart (Sally Blane). But, it is during this night that her uncle (Tully Marshall) is slain. So on another night the will is read a loud to see what everyone gets. Soon fear strikes the hearts of some of people believing they may soon be killed due to what the will says. Oh dear! The murders continue by the gutsy killer as he is committing them right under the cops&apos; noses.\n\nOne negative point of the film is that an uncredited Oscar Smith plays the role of Martin the chauffeur. He is African-American and plays the role 90% of the time completely terrified for &quot;comic relief&quot;. While he can be funny I found the role to be very typecast for that time for the black actors and sadly may not have received correct recognition for his role. If you can allow for this you may enjoy this old time B&amp;W horror film.\n\nOne final note the ending is quite interesting as the killer reveals that he will come back from the dead to haunt you if you tell other people the plot twist. Phew! Thank goodness I did not do that!",

And as far as Gwen Paltrow&apos;s accent is concerned, I must confess I wasn&apos;t too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!\n\nI am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside. The film&apos;s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like &quot;Death Wish III!&quot;\n\nThe English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings. McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story."

      "reviewBody": "Bela Balazs returned to Hungary after the War to help rebuild its film industry. He scripted this film which has been classified by some as an example of &apos;socialist realism&apos; because he was a committed Marxist. This is debatable as Balazs was dismissed amid hardening political attitudes and died alas, in 1949. If one has to attach a label then I think that of &apos;neorealism&apos; is far more appropriate as I sense there is more than a passing nod here to Rossellini&apos;s &apos;Rome, Open City&apos; of 1945. It also calls to mind de Sica&apos;s &apos;Shoeshine&apos; of 1946 especially in its depiction of the children. Just a theory of course. The children in this have been utterly dehumanised by the horrors of war. They are gradually made to feel worthwhile and given hope for the future by the philosophy and civilising influence of Artur Somlay as an elderly classical musician despite their initially wanting to hang him! The run down castle that they have made their home is attacked by fascists and to give themselves courage they whistle the &apos;Marseillaise&apos; that he has taught them. A truly marvellous moment. The scene where Suszsa Banki as Eva shoots her abuser is a splendid piece of film making. Director Geza Radvanyi and his cinematographer Barnabas Hegyi have given us some wonderful images here especially in the grouping of the children. The editing alas leaves a lot to be desired and the score is rather intrusive especially in the earlier sequences. Radvanyi changed his style in the 1950&apos;s with varying results but he would never again match this in terms of immediacy, vitality and above all, &apos;heart&apos;. Good to know that the talent and vision of Bela Balazs were recognised in 1957 by the founding of a studio bearing his name.",

      "reviewBody": "An entry into the horror genre from legendary Czech director Vera Chytilova involving a group of teenagers in a remote ski lodge in the mountains, one that quickly distinguishes itself from others with this kind of premise. For one thing, it&apos;s cast with teenagers playing teenagers (as opposed to the 20-somethings typical to American films), which gave it authenticity in the mannerisms and appearance of these characters. For another, while the kids are in danger and strange things begin to happen, we really have no idea where this is going to go, in contrast to films that simply have one person after another being brutally murdered. So, I liked those things about it.\n\nI also liked the depth of meaning underpinning the drama. It&apos;s a study in human nature, how people tend to turn on one another, particularly when under great stress. In this case that comes from the camp supervisors, who give them a requirement that of the eleven teenagers, one of them must be sacrificed, and then coolly sit back and observe. There are clear parallels to authoritarian governments here, something Chytilová was all too familiar with over the two decades that followed the Soviet crackdown of the Prague Spring, which give the film another dimension.\n\nAs a drama it also has its moments, like the writhing around in the snow and the scene with the snowman, but its story also felt a big fragmentary and not quite fully formed. It was also a mixed bag on the visual effects and edits, with some of them a little rough around the edges, like zooms that seemed random. However, the atmosphere created feels so incredibly real that when shock moments occur, they really pop, as opposed to films that feel manufactured. Worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "This well-done document provides both information and human interest in its two stories.\n\nTold in parallel, we follow two Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses. Joseph Kempler is a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust. He lost his faith as the deaths mounted and the horrors of the concentration camp unfolded for him. Yet in his camp, a separate barracks housed the Jehovah&apos;s Witness prisoners, partly to segregate them from the non-Aryans and partly to reduce the proselytizing. These were political prisoners who by following the tenets of their religion refused to swear allegiance to the Fuehrer and the Fatherland. They could leave if their would sign a &quot;loyalty oath&quot;. As Joseph lost his faith, he become aware of these protesters, was able to attend clandestine meetings, and eventually took on their religion. We are told his story, including his reconciliation with family members (including a daughter he had pretty much abandoned).\n\nThe other story is about twenty-something Seth Thomas, who follows the faith along with the rest of his family. His &quot;auto de fe&quot; comes about with his need for a transplant to replace his (congenitally) diseased liver. He can&apos;t have blood products, so the medical establishment won&apos;t do the transplant. Eventually UCLA (?) agrees to do an experimental bloodless surgery. With huge risks, he agrees; and his father will provide the partial liver donation. The whole family is faced with the risk of losing two members but are steadfast in their belief that&apos;s it&apos;s the right way to live (or die).\n\nA lot of history is filled in around these two stories. We find how many of our rights are due to the fights the Jehovah Witnesses have undertaken: they do not vote, they do not protest(?), but they do litigate.\n\nIf you are the type to answer that particular knock on the door with &quot;No thanks, get lost&quot;, this movie will make you want to ask a few questions, if for no other reason than to exercise nearly-found respect.",

Almost every frame is mesmerizing, but it feels distracting rather than enlightening. The impeccably filmed images work to mask a lack of insight. Not a terrible film, but the novelty of the subject matter will bring it more attention than it ultimately deserves. It&apos;s also derivative. It borrows heavily from Errol Morris.

      "reviewBody": "Simple-minded fun is ensured from this charmingly light-hearted suburban family comedy penned by John Hughes, produced by Aaron Spelling and starring the likes of Michael Keaton (after his break through performance in &quot;Night Shift&quot; the year before), Terri Garr and the comic actor Martin Mull. There&apos;s just something about &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, while it didn&apos;t have me in stitches it seemed to be a pleasant farce which remains quite likable with its repetitive, if accidental gags caught in real life situations (some being over dramatised e.g. the sitcom daydream sequences to enliven the humour) and the daily chores that fill a housewife&apos;s cycle. Keaton is a good sport finding him in plenty of red-faced and grinding situations that soon begin to affect his mental state of mind. Keaton balances the right moods in an amusingly bright turn and goes on to prove how well of a versatile actor he was. When the tables are turned for Garr&apos;s character that&apos;s when she comes out with a wholesomely good performance and a fine show-in by Mull as her smarmy boss. Also in small parts are Jeffrey Tambor and Christopher Lloyd. Stan Dragoti&apos;s breezy direction lets it unfold and Hughes gimmicky material is quite snappy with its banter, but satirical with its vision (despite the silly slapstick) without losing any of its warm-hearted appeal.",

(He still cracks the occasional joke and has his quirks). The story is nothing new, essentially, ex triad member (Played by Max Mok) goes straight so he can be happy with a newfound love, but gangs are hard to get out of... This film also reeks of the late 80&apos;s with it&apos;s colossal cell phones and small boxy cars, as well as the music and clothes, but in my opinion it just adds to the experience.\n\nOverall the actors did their jobs well and the underrated Max Mok is cool as the main character. Although this movie isn&apos;t a masterpiece it is an entertaining watch and it is interesting to see a young Stephen Chow in one of his first major roles.",

French movies are very important for the European movie-scene and Toutes ces belles promesses is a movie to be captured. The story involves a young woman, traveling to an elder women and places from her (and her dead parent&apos;s) past, after breaking up with her friend and discovering that her father had an affair with that women. During these actions all kinds of memories come up and she talks about it. Females are the central figures in this picture, so we are constantly shown what kind of emotions the main characters go through, how they feel about their lives and relationships. The whole story has been told already for several times in other ways, but the acting en direction makes it all interesting and beautiful. I would have liked it to be more compelling, but the honesty of of tout ces belles promesses was more important to me. I gave it 8/10",

He plays the usual very nervous but convincing madman, a role that suits him so good. Every movie with him is like watching a one-man-show. Remove Louis de Funès from this movie and you just have a bleak story nobody is interested in, but with the best comedian France has ever produced it&apos;s just different. I rewatched this movie just to enjoy his gimmicks and facial expressions, like most people do.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a could-have-been that starts out on an attractive premise, but fails to deliver and ends up looking like the makers were too ambitious and wanted to make a horror movie that would work on different levels, with more than just one basic plot line, but ended up with a messy movie that really goes nowhere, just like the tube that the protagonist gets into at the beginning.\n\nThe movie begins with a sequence in the sewage system of London, where two employees are doing their maintenance work. Suddenly, something goes wrong and they&apos;re attacked by someone or something that we don&apos;t get to see. Then it switches over to a party, where we meet Kate (Franka Potente), a young woman who needs to leave to meet her friend. She goes to take the underground, but falls asleep while waiting for her ride. When she wakes up, the train has arrived, but there&apos;s nobody at the station. She gets on the underground, only to find out she&apos;s all alone there too...\n\nThe introduction is certainly appealing to the horror buff, and we&apos;re led to believe that we&apos;re in for a movie that will explore our fear of being trapped, the &quot;underworld&quot; (both in a real and metaphorical way), the dark, claustrophobia... Instead, the movie soon chooses to follow a different plot line, which, in my opinion, is much less interesting and much more conventional, more oriented to commercial success and to please those viewers who look for easy scares and blood-packed, gory scenes. The ending isn&apos;t fulfilling in the least, and seems sudden and not very well written or connected to what we&apos;ve already seen."

      "reviewBody": "Nick Bloomfield is a filmmaker that goes out to find the truth or try at least.   From Kurt and Courtney to Tupac and Biggie he always opts for the most controversial story he can get his hands on and he always rubs people up the wrong way without trying so hard like Michael Moore does in Bowling for Columbine.   \n\nAileen was mad.  She went through so much abuse in the years she was alive it probably became a natural thing to happen to her.   She knew the wrong people, she had the wrong job and she never had the chance to get her say. She talked and talked a lot about what really happened and I think at the end of it all she didn&apos;t care about living as she had spent a good decade behind bars.   The interviews that Nick has with Aileen are highly documented and explain a lot of her personality and who she really is but a lot of the time it was questionable about her insanity.   Through the public eye she was a monster that deserved what was coming where other people looked at her in a different light and took pity because of her abusive up bringing.    The movie Monster was a stunning portrayal of who Aileen really was and how down and out she was even before trying to get back up.   She was whisked through so many relationships and whether or not they were abusive relationships they always left her scared and feeling unwanted.   I got the impression that sometimes when she was prostituting herself she was looking for one man or woman to come along and take her away from all the hurt and pain she must have been feeling. For Jeb Bush to let the execution of Aileen go ahead was an absolute outage as far as justice goes because though she may have wanted it from time to time legally she shouldn&apos;t have been executed.   She had so many past happening going through her head she didn&apos;t know the right from wrong and because of constant abuse of male figures in her life since she was a little girl you couldn&apos;t really say that she wasn&apos;t mixed up and was fully sane to be executed.   \n\nNick bonds with Aileen a lot through the documentary and a lot of the time Aileen does go back and what she says which just puts you in place where you don&apos;t know what to believe but this is such a fascinating story and is a subject that isn&apos;t brought up enough in this day and age because things that happened to Aileen are happening right now to one woman or even a man in nearly every country.   Physical Abuse is a subject that people don&apos;t like to discuss in general because of the horror that follows it but if it was an issue like it should have been with Aileen then I think many people could be saved and to understand there story you have to listen to what they have to say which is what nobody did when coming to Aileen.   Bloomfield again creates something which gives you food for thought and as much as he wants to find the truth again he doesn&apos;t, only a number of conspiracy theories which I always find appealing because it leaves you thinking more about the truth."

Deadlock was one of the first movies to feature the newer, heavier Hauer, who uses his heft to the advantage of his characterization, creating a slightly ridiculous figure (who goes from a ludicrous pony-tail for his duel-to-the-death to a sort of swami outfit to something that looks like it ought to be upholstering a chair in a whorehouse) who is not quite up to the circumstances he finds himself in, but perseveres anyway.  Smart, but hardly a criminal mastermind, his Frank is teamed with an especially charming Mimi Rogers.  Hardly surprising that they go from insults to clinches, but it is appealing that the main thing keeping them apart (their abysmal track records in romance) is what, thanks to empathy, helps bridge the differences between them.  The sci-fi gimmick here is really beside the point.  What counts is the presence of several skillful actors and their deftly drawn characters.  Stephen Tobolowsky is especially amusing, and he has the movie&apos;s best line:  &quot;You nonconformists are all alike.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "A Sci-Fi masterpiece stunningly mounted and directed . Almost beyond the imagination . . A strange adventure into the unknown ! . After being contaminated by what may or not to be radioactive mist , a good man finds himself turning smaller and steadily shedding the inches and pounds until he reaches actually minuscule proportions . A suburban husband named Scott Carey (Grant Williams) begins to shrink because of exposure to a combination of radiation and insecticide and medics (William Schallert) are powerless to help him . He becomes a media darling but starts to feel humiliated and expressing cruel anger against his wife (Randy Stuart) . In his home&apos;s basement he battles lethal threats as spiders , floods or drops of water in an endless and surreal environment . At the ending terminates in a strangely and moving religious assertion of what it really means to be alive.\n\nUniversal classic of the 50s with numerous unforgettable scenes including a rousing showdown with a giant cat and a common house spider. Good performance by Grant Williams in that a strange fog causes him to dwindle becoming into unfortunate man who forces him to view the world in a diverse light than ever before. Intelligent and brooding screenplay by Richard Matheson with many memorable dialogs and including philosophical and pantheist speeches ; furthermore based on his own novel . Joseph Gershenson&apos;s impressive score with thrilling strains. Fine special effects highlight and good Art Direction by Alexander Golitzen .\n\nThis well-edited motion picture is compellingly directed by Jack Arnold in his best foray into the Sci-Fi genre. He reigns supreme as one of the greatest filmmakers of 50s science , achieving an important cult popularity with classics as &quot;The Creature from the Black Lagoon,&quot; and its follow-up titled &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot; that was a nice sequel . &quot;Tarantula&quot; was likewise a lot of amusement . This &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; attained his greatest enduring cult popularity , it&apos;s a thought-provoking and impressive classic that&apos;s lost none of its power throughout the years . Arnold&apos;s final two genre entries were the interesting &quot;Monster on the Campus&quot; and the outlandish &quot;The Space Children¨ . It&apos;s followed by an inferior Sci-Fi comedy titled ¨Incredible shrinking woman (1981)that results to be a semi-spoof , being directed by Joel Schumacher in his first movie , with Lily Tomlin , Charles Grodin and Nead Beatty. Rating : Better than average . Well catching for amazing acting, philosophical and existential argument and really peculiar transformation .",

I thought the interchange romance development was very interesting. Giving complexity to the film. Putting one in a different time, 1950&apos;s or place, Australia. Surrounded with such amicable characters and so human. The idea of preparing a book of their love while waiting to come to Australia seemed so romantic. Making this film probably more something a romantic person would like to see. There should be more pleasurable films like this one, because it still brings a smile to my face to think of it now. Which must be a good sign. If you like love-films, I can definitely recommend watching and enjoying this splendid film.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie begins with two kids climbing up the walls of a canyon and falling into a rattlesnake pit. Because they are so disfigured by the repeated snake bites the local sheriff calls in an expert by the name of &quot;Dr. Tom Parkinson&quot; (Sam Chew Jr.) who works at a nearby college. Although puzzled by the numerous bites he doesn&apos;t really offer much help until other cases begin to emerge. After that he and a female photographer named &quot;Ann Bradley&quot; (Elizabeth Chauvet) are led by their investigation to a top-secret army compound which seems to be in the in the middle of all of the incidents. Now, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven&apos;t seen it I will just say that this wasn&apos;t terribly bad as far as films of this nature are concerned. Personally, I didn&apos;t think the acting was too bad considering the awful script and some of the ridiculous scenarios the actors were given. That said, although I typically enjoy movies of this type I thought this particular film wasn&apos;t nearly as good as it could have been and I have rated it accordingly.",

My recommendation is to listen to the song, then not bother watching the rest of the film. \n\nIt does not take long to realize that the familiar story has been changed odiously and unforgivingly to fit another vision that is nowhere near as quaint and clever as Twain&apos;s. The writers have hijacked the famous title, changed the story, sanitized it in a way that recalls the censorship cases of the past, removed the authentic dialect, extracted the charm, and added music. We might ask why.\n\nApparently, to serve their own agenda. Then why not create this other story under another title, rather than usurping Twain&apos;s reputation? The result they have achieved with this modified piece is as inauthentic as a Bach fugue with its notes changed. Those who celebrate Twain&apos;s writing skills, his peerless wit, and his hard work preserving the native dialects of his time and location will find this to be a shallow (and dishonest) tweaking of Twain&apos;s timeless classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Beaufort is a remarkable war movie, with a cinematic style that really says something about the war and the situation in which the troops are in. the story is told through the eyes of the main character, Liraz, who&apos;s awareness of himself and the nature of the battle he&apos;s in gradually deepens into a sharp and original view on war and fear of death. the tension that is created throughout the film is a result not of fast paced action events, but through a series of scenes that takes the viewer into the world of this outpost, with all its claustrophobia, and mixed emotions that include the thrill of danger and numbness toward tragedy, but also simple fear that cannot be overcome. I recommend this movie to everyone.",

Of course, I&apos;m not a Soviet Union fan, but the movie always was something very magical for me. Mostly because I emphasized with the princess (my childhood was all about princesses) a lot. Now I watched it again and I feel surprised by their acting and visual effects (for that time and place). But the biggest impression for me was princesses costumes. I mean, I have never seen a better dressed princess in my life! This movie might seem like a dream (in a funny way), but I recommend to watch it at least for costumes. They are unforgettable.",

      "reviewBody": "The film Dive! Is an interesting look at the dichotomy between the excess of American&apos;s consumption of food and the scourge of hunger that still affects this country every day. Filmmaker Jeremy Seifert takes the viewer from dumpster fulls of what he considers perfectly good food, to food shelves that can&apos;t keep up with demand. The act of dumpster diving at first seems almost grotesque, but as the movie progresses you see how he chooses his garbage. The gag reflex in the back of your throat actually begins to relax. The incredible amount of waste, almost half of all food in America is thrown away, really does make dumpster diving almost acceptable, even reasonable. In addition to the facts and figures, dumpster diving and meals from said dives, there are the requisite attacks on Corporate America that every documentary in the last thirty years include. The filmmakers focus is Trader Joes but he never actually gets an interview with anyone in the company, so it&apos;s rather anti-climatic. Overall it&apos;s an interesting film worthy of the 52 minutes it takes to watch, but you may want to skip the popcorn for this one."

      "reviewBody": "Telly is one of a large group of young friends who live for sex, drugs and pleasure with little thought of responsibility or morality.  Telly in particular loves sex with girls even younger than him, and they all have to be virgins to please him.  However one girl who has only had sex with Telly finds herself testing positive for HIV.  She sets out to find him before he can spread the disease any further. I saw this when it came out as it entered the UK in a rage of tabloid anger and middleclass `we&apos;ll all be killed in our beds&apos; style furore.  Back then I was maybe more giving or maybe more determined to appreciate it simply because I thought the papers had overreacted.  I still think the tabloids kicked up a storm for nothing but now I see past the worthy face the film has on and see it in a different light.\n\nThe film is worthy, no doubt, those individuals who live like this do exist and are a real problem to themselves and others, however the film tries really hard to shock us.  Nobody in this film is `normal&apos; or in anyway considerate  they all only care about themselves, they are all open to rape a girl who says no, or beat someone to near death for bumping into them. This leads us to think that everyone is like this and to all be shocked. Yes  some (many?) young people like sex and drugs but how many live like this?\n\nBut the film wants to over-blow things simply because the shock value adds value to the subject.  So we have rape, beatings, AIDS being spread, children barely 10 smoking weed etc and the film has a mix of shock but also a sort of sensationalisation about it  like Clarke is rubbing his hands behind the camera ad directing, saying `worse, worse, more, more etc&apos;.  This only stops for the final shot and line where the film condemns this but up till then you&apos;d be forgiven for not seeing the judgement.\n\nThe cats are most unlikely versions of Kevin Smith&apos;s Jay but without the crude wit or charm  they make Jay look like a man about town.  I  know that&apos;s there characters but some of them just deliver crude skater stereotypes.  I know they&apos;re all first time actors but still  several have done better since.  Fitzpatrick is OK but his character is one-dimensional and we never get to see him have deeper stuff to deal with.  Pierce is again a cartoon but at least appears to have something else behind his eyes  shame he&apos;s dead now.  Sevigny is good as is Dawson but that&apos;s mainly because they do have something of value to say.  The rest are just all there to `shock&apos; us  `oh, look&apos; says Larry Clark `they&apos;re doing drugs, there&apos;s girls kissing girls, there&apos;s fights and shocking sex  isn&apos;t it all lovely and terrible!!!?&apos;.\n\nOverall it&apos;s worth a watch maybe once simply because this is a lost world that I&apos;ll hopefully never see.  But don&apos;t get sucked in by the film pretending to be important or smart  it&apos;s neither simply because it only wants to shock us and it revels in every disgusting or shocking frame."

This film, along with the excellent Goodfellas, Awakenings, Night and the City, A Bronx Tale, and Cape Fear highlighted a great actor&apos;s resume. He hasn&apos;t done many great films in a while, but his acting chops speak for themselves. He stars here as David Merrill, a blacklisted director in Hollyweird, who&apos;s basically accused of being a communist and certain government factions want him to name names. His performance, although subdued, is very solid as he struggles with the decision to either report his friends, who are thought to be Communist in order to rescue his once promising career, or refuse to give up any names so their lives and careers won&apos;t be destroyed also. There&apos;s a moving scene between Merrill and congress as they bombard him with questions and accusations. This is probably the most memorable scene, but I thought it tries to wrap the film up in a neat little ball, as opposed to letting us know exactly what went on in those supposedly communist meetings Merrill was a part of, and what was discussed there and who attended these meetings.\n\nGeorge Wendt does a commendable job as Bunny Baxter, even though it&apos;s difficult to see him other than Norm from Cheers, but I digress. Annette Benning and Patricia Wettig also give solid performances in this forgotten little film based on a true story."

If you appreciated &quot;Into Great Silence&quot; or &quot;Vision&quot; or &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; or even &quot;2001&quot; you will appreciate the poetic quality of this film. It is important for us to slow down occasionally and allow some films to affect us without the necessity of being slammed over the head with noise and speed and highly charged emotions. After all, for a film placed in its time, that is a more realistic portrayal of life during those centuries. This film illuminates the artistic process and aims of the artist. We are fortunate that the makers of this film dared to create this unique journey into a canvas of one of the world&apos;s great artists."

      "reviewBody": "Third movie-version of the Fannie Hurst novel, following successful adaptations in 1932 and 1941, this time with the glossy and unmistakable Ross Hunter touch. Susan Hayward is hardly a &quot;back street gal&quot; here, she&apos;s a would-be dress designer from Lincoln, Nebraska who has a meet-cute with returning soldier (and married man) John Gavin, apparently the sole heir to a department store chain. It takes a few reels to get these two together, but in the meanwhile our heroine goes to New York and then to Rome as the assistant to one of the top fashion designers in the world. Once Gavin catches up to her in Paris--and the gossip hits the fan--audiences can clearly see how dated this plot has become: a sharp, successful businesswoman wouldn&apos;t be shamed by her extra-marital affair, she&apos;d be applauded! It isn&apos;t believable in the slightest, though producer Ross Hunter&apos;s penchant for luxurious suffering reaches almost an unparalleled peak here. The only thing Hunter can&apos;t quite fix is the chemistry between Hayward and Gavin; the stars have a comfortable, kiss-on-the-forehead type of love relationship (no big sparks), while Susan treats smitten Charles Drake so badly he completely vanishes from the scene! Vera Miles is a hoot as Gavin&apos;s alcoholic wife (&quot;I almost forgot we had kids!&quot;), while the screenplay pulls one astounding melodramatic event after another from its hat. For lovers of these woozy romantic pleasures, &quot;Back Street&quot; would be hard to top. *** from ****",

Beginning with Terence Hill, whom I love not just as a &quot;sidekick&quot; to Bud Spencer, but he&apos;s especially good in those movies.\n\nI only watched this real life adaptation and not the sequel it spawned ... they might have done some things better there once they learned the ropes ... I did watch the French version of this ... which was especially funny because of the way they pronounce Lucky Luke ... I never thought of it be uttered that way. Anyway back to this and the movie is quite ok/decent, but not really that great. You got some interesting mannerisms by Hill and some throwbacks to the comics. One I especially liked was the &quot;talking horse&quot; (well it&apos;s more thinking horse, but we can hear its thoughts ... Jolly Jumper for the win) .... I was missing Rantanplan to be honest - but again maybe the sequel had him in it.",

      "reviewBody": "An energy dome (the titular &apos;wall&apos;) periodically materialises on the snowy taiga that causes people to apparently enter their own past, perhaps as part of an alien attempt at communication. The premise is similar to the superior &apos;Solaris&apos; (1972). Both films find isolated researchers studying an inexplicable phenomenon that may be sentient and attempting to communicate with the Earthlings through visions extracted from their memories. Neither film offers much in the way exposition. As most of &apos;The Mysterious Wall&apos; takes place in, or around, a cabin and the Wall itself is depicted as storm-clouds, the film is not nearly as interesting as &apos;Solaris&apos;, which takes place in a space-station orbiting the titular planet, looking down on what might be a sentient ocean. &apos;The Mysterious Wall&apos; is quite talky and not a lot happens as the researchers discuss the phenomenon, comment occasionally on bureaucracy, and eventually venture close enough to the wall to seemingly be transported into an event from their past, where the people they interact with may be aliens. Despite being available on-line with English subtitles, the film appears to be obscure and surprisingly little has been written about it (at least in English). Likely only of interest to dedicated fans of the genre or of Soviet cinema.",

James Nesbitt was very good in the roll of the boys father although his &apos;northern&apos; accent was a little strange, and its always nice to see Daisy Donovan in anything\n\nOnce the film ended the audience must have applauded for about 5 minutes, something I have not witnessed for some years now.\n\nSee this film, tell your friends to see it and go again with them.

After a decade of abuse, Mr. PARK decides that he has had enough and declares war. Mr. PARK hires a motley crew of characters and waits for the gangs to strike again to take his revenge: One Punch has a punch powerful enough to take out Fedor; High KickÂ’s feet move faster than his brain; Big Bluff has jaw muscles that never stop moving; and Body Twist Throw can literally hurl anything and everything within reach. Mr. PARK is ready, but a group of high school rebels attacks instead and sends events down an unexpected road. Though One Punch and his friends have been hired by Mr. PARK they refuse to simply obey his commands. Also lingering around the station are Pebble and his friends, whose only wish is to rob it. ThereÂ’s a bus full of escaped convicts whose bus is filled with the wrong gas, and a real biker gang looking for revenge on One Punch and his friends. Lastly are the police looking for the runaway cons. Every minute that passes takes Mr. PARK further and further away from his original plans.",

Ferrell is a likable guy and plays likable characters, but often his films feel a little too much like extended Saturday Night Live sketches; even if they&apos;re funny, they just don&apos;t have that much to them.\n\nBut I love The Other Guys. The premise is unexceptional, a mismatched buddy movie about two undistinguished cops who stumble into a big case, but the movie is wildly funny.\n\nOne of the things I love about this movie is how everyone plays it straight. Ferrell is almost as low key here as a cop-accountant as he was in Stranger Than Fiction, and while the movie is often extremely silly, no one in it ever gives a hint that they know it (although Ferrell has a few over-the-top moments that have that SNL cartoonish feel to them that I could have done without). Wahlberg doesn&apos;t act like he&apos;s making a cop movie parody, he acts like he&apos;s making a cop movie. There is a certain odd realism in moments where the heroes pull off something clever or dazzling and take a moment to be impressed with themselves.\n\nMainly though, this movie is just really, really funny. I could not stop laughing.",

This is supposed to be a family film, but Bruce Cowling isn&apos;t a family film type villain. He&apos;s an ordinary guy who succumbs to the traditions of gold fever. Fred C. Dobbs never got as psychotic as this guy when he decides he doesn&apos;t want to split the strike that his partner Paul Kelly has uncovered, neither with Kelly or Ann Doran widow of a third partner who has a son Gary Gray.\n\nLassie is called Shep in this film, but it&apos;s our beloved collie just the same. Shep is the only witness to what happened to Kelly. Man can&apos;t prove anything that can stand up in a court of law, but the collie knows the story and the collie settles accounts in a manner worthy of a Corleone.\n\nThe Painted Hills is from MGM&apos;s B picture unit. I&apos;d give this one a look, not as bad as some reviewers make it out.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, let me say that I&apos;m an Okada Junichi fan. That being said, this movie was average, if not below average. The plot has no commendable twist or turn, the motif old and not creative at all, and there&apos;s not much to &quot;learn&quot; from this movie that makes you go &quot;Ahhh&quot;. Like other reviews on this board, I have to agree, &quot;What is this movie trying to say?&quot;. For me, the theme of loneliness of a 35 year old woman was way better portrayed through the character of Kimiko and her relationship with Koji. I have no idea how the main couple could carry the &quot;35-year-old lonely woman&quot; theme. The interaction between her and her husband, plus her &quot;loneliness&quot; is just not seen nearly enough! One would think Toru and Shifumi love each other because they both are very good-looking! Um, so, this movie is not that good in my opinion. However, every one completed their part very well. Kuroki Hitomi-san was very beautiful and classy, Okada Junichi is expressive with his eyes and voice as usual, but my favorite will have to be Terajima Shinobu-san, who plays Kimiko. Not only does her character has depth, but her acting was good on its own. Through her, and her only, I see the possible loneliness of a woman who&apos;s trapped in a boring life, with a husband she doesn&apos;t love (or has grown out of love for him), and who yearns for something more than just the everyday life cooking in the kitchen and doing housework from dawn to dusk.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film as part of the Rotterdam Film Festival 2012. It has no logical story line, no moral and no clear happy end. Yet it is entertaining for the whole duration, with absurd dialogs and even more absurd turns of events. The tone is set during the opening credits, where we listen in on a radio reporter answering phone calls from people with the utmost idiotic opinions about an imminent invasion of aliens. The latter appearance in the sky forms the trigger for the rest of the story.\n\nThe story goes on by following our main character (Luca) visiting a &quot;professional lady&quot; (that is what she calls herself) in an even more absurd settings of a furniture showroom. And I could go on endlessly with recalling subsequent events, rolling over each other with only a skeleton story to tie them together. But still, it is much more than a series of sketches, so read on.\n\nThe word &quot;drama&quot; in the announcement loosely relates to something that happened in Luca&apos;s youth between his father and his mother. It should serve to explain Luca&apos;s non-existing relationships with women, but psychology as a science is stretched to the limits here. It does not matter very much, since all other things that happen in this film are not very scientific either.\n\nWe get to see some aliens, with sub-standard appearance, of which I can only say that they look &quot;traditional&quot;. The aliens are smaller than us, but with relatively large heads and large eyes to compensate. Apart from seemingly having mysterious powers to cure people, any other technical or mental abilities remain uncertain. We don&apos;t see any high-tech devices, and we don&apos;t even know they have some.\n\nAll in all, undeniable entertainment for the full 95 minutes. Do not expect a consistent plot, for you won&apos;t get one. It is not memorable for years to come, but it has no such pretenses.",

Even Morricone did sound for this movie! As all Belmondo aficionados know, the script and plot has not to much of importance but here it is quite good! Also he does some stunts in this movie also! Only thing with this movie I don&apos;t like is that I haven&apos;t found it with Englis subs or translation. So I have seen it in my language long time ago (about 20yrs) and lately with different languages. I am Belmondo fan but I like this movie best also because his choice of car/cars in here. He is driving Lotus Super Seven which is superb sportster in the world! Anyway, go and see it!",

The wreck contains a potion that of course, one of the crew members has to drink. The potion turns out to be a formula that turns people into reptile like monsters that will eventually spread their symptoms to everybody else on board.\n\nWe have seen this all before. The Thing, the Alien series, The Deep, etc all have one idea or another that were thrown into this film. You have got the creature that takes over people&apos;s bodies(Alien, The Thing), the blood supply being depleted by the creature(The Thing), the remainder of the crew trying to escape the ship in a limited amount of time before it self destructs(Alien), and the scene where all of the guys are sitting around eating, talking about sex and other things(Alien).\n\nThis movie could have been a lot better if they had thrown something original into it. Why not use more comic relief? That may have spiced up the film a bit. However, the film is not that bad and if you cannot find anymore decent sci-fi horror films to view, this one may just be up your alley.",

Meanwhile Ryu and Lee realise that there is a mole inside their agency that keeps Hee one step ahead of them.\n\nOther reviewers have said that this film is a good addition to the `heroic bloodshed&apos; genre of Hong Kong cinema, with it&apos;s gory bloodshed and bullet ballets.  However I personally feel that this is to do the film a disservice  the film doesn&apos;t just lift that style but rather delivers a solid thriller story line with plenty of well directed action.  The plot is a detective story with the added boost of the terrorist attacks.  It has a couple of nice twists along the way that work pretty well.  The downside is that the plot occasionally makes minor jumps that are hard to follow, for example an action scene is immediately followed by a scene where the same characters are in a different situation, this happens twice and threw me a little.  But these are minor problems.  The political arguments are not too complex  one reviewed said to go and read up on Korean history before seeing Shiri, this is far from necessary.  It is quite simple but doesn&apos;t get in the way of the bigger thriller story line.\n\nThe action is not of the slow-mo OTT type seen in The Killer or Hard Boiled but is more like the extended gun battles seen in Heat.  Yes, they are a bit OTT but they aren&apos;t as heavily stylised as in many HK movies.  Instead the tension comes from the excellent direction.  Using a handheld camera really makes the gun battles feel intense and very close to where you&apos;re sitting. The action does have some HK clichés but these are still well delivered.\n\nThe cast are all well Han Suk-Kyu (Ryu) does well with the action as well as the romance subplot with Kim Yoon-jin.  The rest of the cast are good  even the comedy odd-ball is good value, compared to the occasional Hollywood comedy character that can be grating.\n\nI haven&apos;t seen too many Korean films but this was a particularly good thriller with intense action.  Overall I enjoyed this film and fully expect America to pick up on the fact that it has action AND a workable story and commission a remake pretty soon.  Wouldn&apos;t you rather see the original first?"

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m bursting with good things to say about this film. Japan&apos;s (maybe the world&apos;s) greatest actor playing one of Japan&apos;s greatest heroes is already goosebump inducing. In fact, all of the cast is stellar. As the other comments have pointed out, if you don&apos;t know the story of the Shinsengumi, you&apos;re at a disadvantage. This is a sort of Japanese Iliad, a real life story of heroism and tragedy. Everybody in Japan knows the names of the leaders of the Shinsengumi in the way that American children learn about George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. The good news is that the DVD program notes are fairly encyclopedic. They cover the major characters, places and events. Serizawa&apos;s entry mentions that &quot;his hobbies include drawing, long fights on the beach and driving foreign invaders from his homeland.&quot; \n\nThe film starts out well by including the ugliness of the Wolves of Mibu period. Hijikata is portrayed in a very dark way. Toward the end, Kondo actually says that Hijikata did all the dirty work so that Kondo could keep his hands (and soul) clean. Even though the Shinsengumi are the heroes, there is a point where you will be yelling at Hijikata to commit seppuku. The shogunate is a mess and you end up rooting for Kondo&apos;s devotion to the shogunal party at the same time that you want the shogunate to dry up and blow away. The film manages to be nuanced and yet get you jumping up and down yelling at your television.\n\nThe production is beautiful, everything that you would want a samurai film to be. The costumes of the Shinsengumi are semi-accurate, unlike the beautiful but wrong ones in Gohatto. Although the pattern is correct in this film, the real colors were much more lurid. In real life, they must have looked like a troop of murderous peacocks as they charged through Kyoto. The exterior shots are gorgeous and the interior shots are lovely as well, although everybody seems to have brand new tatami at every point throughout the movie.",

Which is no surprise considering all of the previous work of Aldis Hodge and Danielle Deadwyler.\n\nEdwin Hodge also was a nice surprise, cause I only remember him in them Purge movies but he did a solid job here.\n\nYes, the other review is correct compering Parallel to Coherence sinse they both share a pretty similar premise.

      "reviewBody": "This comedy is centred on ad-man Dan Edwards and his wife Val. They have been married for nineteen years; he is content but she is feeling a lack of attention from him. It doesn&apos;t help that their friend, committed bachelor, Ernie Brewer always jokes that not marrying her was this biggest regret. Eventually she wants a divorce; something that comes as a surprise to Dan. Friends suggest they take a second honeymoon in Mexico to put a spark back in the marriage... events lead to everything getting even worse.\n\nComedy is one of the more selective genres; what makes one person laugh might leave another cold... while this was definitely corny at times it certainly made me laugh. There are decent jokes throughout especially once they head to Mexico... even if the depiction of that country is less than flattering in a way that probably wouldn&apos;t be allowed in a modern film. Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were fun as friends Dan and Ernie and Deborah Kerr was equally solid as Val. Cesar Romero&apos;s performance as the Mexican who seems to do everything; easy marriage, easy divorce, run the town hotel etc., is a highlight. Also notable is Frank&apos;s daughter Nancy who plays Dan&apos;s daughter Tracy. On the down side I could have done without Dan&apos;s &apos;comedy Scotswoman&apos; mother in law... she even played the bagpipes! Overall this won&apos;t amuse everybody but I found it to be a fun and inoffensive comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "Cheaply-made and over-simplified account of the life and times of the most notorious gangland figure of The Roaring Twenties; clearly intended as exploitation - with liberal doses of nudity and foul language to embellish the typical blood-soaked exploits - the Fox film was produced by Roger Corman (who was associated with any number of similar genre efforts, released in the wake of BONNIE AND CLYDE [1967] and which became an even greater commodity after THE GODFATHER [1972]).\n\nAs Capone, Ben Gazzara chews more than the scenery - as he obviously has placed something in his mouth to help &apos;authenticate&apos; his delivery! Similarly, so as to give the impression of realism, the script continuously precedes scenes with the date and year when the event depicted is supposed to have happened; still, this doesn&apos;t prevent the film from appearing clichéd most of the time! Curiously, the film ends with Capone on parole going mad in some luxurious mansion - a turn of events which, as far as I know, is completely fabricated.\n\nWith the various real-life characters and myriad factions on display, one is prone to lose track of who&apos;s killing who and why - but, for all that, the carnage is constant and moderately well-staged (though, at one point, Corman inserts footage from his own film THE ST. VALENTINE&apos;S DAY MASSACRE [1967], also a Fox production!). The cast is made up of veterans like Gazzara, Harry Guardino and a cameo by John Cassavetes, and newcomers such as Sylvester Stallone (a pretty good pre-stardom role as Capone&apos;s right-hand man who eventually has his boss ousted!), regular baddie Martin Kove (as a thug from a rival clan) and lovely Susan Blakely as Capone&apos;s young but free-spirited moll.\n\nNeedless to say, the film doesn&apos;t do justice to the character (seen in countless other gangster pics, the most significant impressions perhaps being those given, Method-style, by Rod Steiger in AL CAPONE [1959] and Robert De Niro in THE UNTOUCHABLES [1987]) - but neither is it the disaster Leonard Maltin claims, having slapped a BOMB rating to it! By the way, while the print on Fox&apos;s R2 DVD is O.K., the audio is pretty lousy (often displaying a distracting hiss).",

This film is meant to be cliche. So it&apos;s made more like a rom com teenager movie.\n\nEven though it can be a one time weekend movie for you if you don&apos;t have anything to watch and if you&apos;re a music lover. This movie has the best songs from &quot;Bahaara To Sadka Kiya&quot; and much more.\n\nThis movie was something new in Bollywood. There&apos;re also similar movies of that time like &quot;Anjaana Anjaani&quot; &quot;Dostana&quot; n all. These supposed to be entertaining dramas nothing more than that.\n\nSo if you wanna relive the fresh air of bollywood you can watch this movie. You won&apos;t regret it.",

It is similar to Warfront, another powerful WW 1 film produced by Germany long after the war was over. Both films have strong anti-war sentiments, which are much-deserved. After all, who in their right mind thinks that either of these films show the glory of war? War is a filthy, gruesome business, where hours of tedium are punctuated by a few minutes of unbelievable violence. The cinematography of this film and Warfront was magnificent. The camera captures everything you might imagine about the horror of WW1 and some things you can&apos;t imagine. The acting is first-rate and understated, and the direction is impeccable. My grandfather was in this war, and would never talk about it. Now, I see why. Men sleeping while standing in close quarters in holes in the ground, steeped in urine up to their ankles, getting gassed, and enduring bombardment for up to 8 days at a time in the dark. How humans survived these conditions is beyond my comprehension. Must be seen to be appreciated.",

      "reviewBody": "This screwball comedy brings together some great dramatic actors in unaccustomed comedic roles.  The results are mixed (but mostly good), with some terrific slapstick and some pure drivel.  Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them, only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes, they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over. Meanwhile, Paige is running her own scam on Jack (Jason Lee) who owns a bar resting on prime real estate worth $3 Million.\n\nIt is mostly pratfall humor, with lots of sight gags and general nuttiness, which is often uproariously funny.  The whole idea that the diminutive Paige could have been spawned from the Amazonian Maxine is implied comedy at its finest, leading us to conclude that Paige&apos;s father could only have been a midget.\n\nGene Hackman completely steals the show as the wheezy billionaire.  Hackman, who is one of our national treasures as a dramatic actor, shows magnificent range, and he turns out to be the best comedian of the bunch.  Sigourney Weaver is also in rare form brandishing some bodacious outfits and undergarments.  She is especially funny as Olga, trotting out impressive broken English and even doing some vocals accompanied by a Russian balalaika band.  Ray Liotta gives a lighthearted and funny performance as a chop shop owner who can&apos;t get over his love for Maxine, even though he knows she scammed him.  Jason Lee&apos;s understated nice guy portrayal serves as the perfect counterpart to Jennifer Love Hewitt&apos;s bratty vamp.  The perennially cute Hewitt still can&apos;t seem to transition into grownup roles.  No matter how sexy they make her up (and they do quite a good job with her considerable attributes), her pubescent mannerisms and delivery still make her come off as a teenage harpy.  In her defense, this is what the role required, but it doesn&apos;t do much to move her out of her character rut.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of good fun here that is often dissipated by puerile absurdity.  Still, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly delivered by Weaver and Hackman, that make this a better than average comedy.  I rated it 7/10.  Fans who like seeing Sigourney and Jennifer in sexy outfits will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "First time of watching this simple silent, and of course I like it as I wouldn&apos;t comment on (subjective of course) crap! It&apos;s a plain tale of a love triangle set on the Isle of Man, the woman (Ondra) falls in love with the best friend (Keen) of her absent husband-to-be (Brisson). Thanks to having to get round the censorship rules, you have to pay attention about 48 minutes in (out of 82 minutes running time on my tape) although it should be fairly obvious what was going to happen. As the immortal Bard, Charlie Chaplin said in The 1942 Gold Rush &quot;Buzz Buzz Buzz&quot;. As Ondra stays dressed I can only surmise that this was the angle from which Hitch got his kicks.\n\nAnd Anny Ondra is wondrous to behold, she was a real beauty who still looks modern all the way from &apos;29 and worth the price of any DVD alone. She held my attention anyway, and whatever the outcome of the story would have been I would have been on her side!\n\nBut what she saw in either of her lovers is beyond me I&apos;m afraid - Brisson couldn&apos;t stop laughing and Keen looked as if he&apos;d never smiled in his life. It&apos;s not quite up to the level of Flesh and the Devil, but there&apos;s so few British silent films extant that it&apos;s well worth a look, or even just to view Hitchcock&apos;s early efforts.",

To make a film about the ongoing war between two tribes who have the same forefathers and have to share a piece of land is not easy!! The only way, in my opinion, to make a film about it, is to make it light and transparent. And that is exactly what Elia Suleiman does. Absurd scenes (the Palestinian beauty who turns into a Ninja and destroy the acrobatic Israeli marksmen), but also very subtil stories about Palestinians who make life miserable for each other in the Occupied terretories. He uses several biblical symbols (eating eggs, killing a snake) and uses repetition to show how life gets by when you&apos;re living like subhumans. My cup of tea!!",

This film was a harmless romantic comedy just like the millions out there: Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days- all of which are rated PG 13. I am so angry at the blatant discrimination in the rating of this film. Because it portrays lesbians FAIRLY (meaning, no one freaks out about their sexual orientation), it is rated R. And this might be no big deal. I mean, after all, we can all watch this film as adults. However, the blatant discimination makes me angry. And furthermore, making this film, like thousands of other films about LGBT people unavailable to a younger audience further isolates and &quot;other-izes&quot; LGBT people. Its not right."

      "reviewBody": "Having first watched the movie at 14, I remember being struck by hearing the word &apos;govno&apos; (sh*t) for the first time ever on the then-still-Soviet TV (I bet it really was *the* first time in history  anyone wants to add this to trivia section?:)... What an open boldness and freedom, I thought! As years passed, I was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting, but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my 14-y.o. impression: helplessness. There&apos;s an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie, of primitive degenerate tide (embodied by Sharikov) sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas... It&apos;s a great metaphor of Russian revolution in general, inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to &apos;upgrade&apos; the lower classes, only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it... An extremely fine and talented piece, wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form. Symbolically enough, the movie itself marked the end of the Soviet movie traditions era before the Hollywood tsunami had knocked them over  for good, it seems, judging by most current Russian movies (most of them labeled &apos;blockbusters&apos; in prerelease!!! trailers and posters:).\n\nFunnily, that &apos;govno&apos; episode is in no contradiction to Efenstor&apos;s comment above re rude language of current generation... From what I&apos;ve already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this, but it was not. A mild word by current standards, it was way too rude back then, and just rude enough to show the true nature of all Sharikovs... BTW, re Efenstor&apos;s lament, it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon, especially for Russian speakers, where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation! But I join in regret that ALL the meaning in today&apos;s teenager&apos;s talk may be expressed by cusswords. I feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that&apos;s most efficient for the task:) Well, this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them, or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it.",

His most famous student was Marin Marain (1656-1728), played by Gerard Depardieu (both pere and fils). He was accepted as student but told perhaps a bit too dismissively that although he played well he was most fit for public squares and perhaps the Court, the latter held in deep contempt by Sainte-Colombe.\n\nSubsequently we indeed do see Marain bouncing a pole on the the Royal floor (apparently they way they conducted back then) leading a group of Court musicians in what was simply the music of the age, i.e., pomp and circumstance, but within the context of the story hopelessly dull and inartistic. Can the story mean simply that music should have feeling? Or is there more? A prevailing cliche is when there are no longer words to describe, that&apos;s where music starts. Is that good enough? What would Monseiur de Sainte Colombe say about that?\n\nThere is a subplot involving love interest that informs the theme. As indicated above, the young Marain is played by Gerard&apos;s son with the latter taking over as the adult. Wow, how often does that happen? Depardieu fils is impressive. There are fairly long music passages that the uninitiated might find a tough go but it is a well-made film, meticulously so. Well worth it for those who hang around.",

      "reviewBody": "Kronos is slightly different from other 1950&apos;s/Atomic age sci fi&apos;s as the &apos;monster&apos; that threatens the world in this one is a massive robot, Kronos. This was released on video in America as part of the excellent Science Fiction Gold collection, of which I have a copy.\n\nA giant object crashes into the ocean and turns out to be a flying saucer. Scientists are sent to investigate, but one of them gets possessed by an alien and starts acting strange.  At the same time, something strange rises out of the ocean and turns out to be a giant robot, Kronos.  Two of the scientists land on top of it by helicopter to examine it.  It then starts going on the rampage, destroying everything in its path.  A nuclear bomb is dropped on it to try to destroy it, but this makes things worse as Kronos uses nuclear energy to get stronger.  A method is found to destroy it in the end though and turns out to be a success.   \n\nFor a low budget movie, the special effects are quite good and the music score is rather creepy.\n\nThe movies stars 50&apos;s sci fi regulars Jeff Morrow (This Island Earth), Morris Ankrum (Invaders From Mars), John Emery (Rocketship XM), Robert Shayne (Teenage Caveman) and Morrow&apos;s love interest is played by Barbara Lawrence.  Morrow, Ankrum and Shayne also appeared together in The Giant Claw, made the same year as Kronos, 1957.\n\nThis movie is a must for fans of 1950&apos;s sci fi, like me.\n\nRating: 3 and a half stars out of 5."

During the Cold War the USA supported some pretty nauseating folks, El Salvador&apos;s regime was one of them. The unnamed Central American country where the action takes place is El Salvador.\n\nCharles Bronson is a retired hit-man who takes a commission to avenge the death of Theresa Saldana&apos;s husband, a journalist critical of the regime. The guy she holds responsible is Joseph Maher, known as &apos;El Doctor&apos; a bloodless sadist of distinctly non-Latin origin who apparently holds the rank of torturer in chief.\n\nIt&apos;s Maher&apos;s performance which you will remember from The Evil That Men Do. He&apos;s a man who apparently studied under Joseph Mengele and learned the trade well. He has but one weakness, for his lesbian sister, Antoinette Bower. Bronson plays on that to get his man.\n\nAlso note some good work from Raymond St. Jacques as Maher&apos;s number one assistant and from John Glover a sleazy CIA station chief in Central America who apparently Maher and company can call on for help.\n\nJose Ferrer is in the film all too briefly at the beginning as he hires Bronson on Saldana&apos;s behalf. He&apos;s always been a favorite of mine, I wish there was more of him here.\n\nAs for the climax, Director J. Lee Thompson took his inspiration from Tennessee Williams&apos;s Suddenly Last Summer. Some very eerie parallels to what happens to Sebastian in that film.\n\nI like The Evil That Men Do because it deals with evil as an entity unto itself. We just have to remember 9/11 to realize that. The Doctor is pure evil and we rejoice in bringing him down.",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing the trailer for this movie and checking out the cast and filmmakers I made this a must see at this years Sundance Film Festival. The combination of Alexander Payne (Sideways,Election,About Schmidt) producing and Michael Douglas playing wacky gives hope for another great dramedy along the lines of Little Miss Sunsine and Sideways. King of California easily meets those hopes and for many it will be much more enjoyable then those former films. The movie features Douglas as Charlie a recently released mental patient with a whimsical fascination for buried Spanish treasure. While Charlie has been away his 16 year old daughter Miranda played by Evan Racheal Wood has managed to avoid child services, dropped out of school and support herself and their home by working full-time at Mcdonalds. Upon Charlies arrival home Miranda finds that life was much easier without Charlie around, not only does she have to support their home but now she has to take care of her unstable father. Persitent with his intent to search for a mythical buried Spanish treasure Miranda begrudgingly agrees to help him. The movie finds its humor and warmth in the moments shared between Charlie and Miranda during their treasure hunting through developed suburbia that leads them to a unlikely final destination. In the end the real treasure may not be the gold after all but the love between a daughter and father.\n\nThe ever developing Evan Racheal Wood is solid in the role of Miranda, the whole movie develops through her narration and her acting is effortlessly touching. Michael Douglas is outstanding and in true form here, from start to finish he&apos;s a joy to watch, this is easily his best performance since Wonder Boys. This will definitely be one of the best movies in 2007, expect praise a plenty for Douglas come awards time.",

Instead, &quot;Silvio Forever&quot; part with biographical notes of adolescence and childhood of the character with lots of news and interesting curiosity, but declines due to report and to see &quot;gag&quot; (unfortunately actually made ​​by Berlusconi) and other anecdotes you may very well look on Youtube and who is informed about the character already knows. I was expecting a cut more biographical, what that this film is not so satisfactory, though it is certainly smooth and enjoyable for those who want to get an idea about the man who is Silvio Berlusconi. Too bad the movie is released before his res judicata and does not mention all the legal troubles of the subject.",

I heard someone call it the &quot;Christmas movie for people who don&apos;t like Christmas movies&quot; and the quest to find it was on.\n\nThis is the story of a Christmas in which the emotionally wounded family of a Church of England clergyman come home and attempt to have a happy holiday. What happens is not your typical happy tearjerker, nor is it a Christmas nightmare. Its a reasonably realistic, as much as films of the time could be in 75 minutes, look at a family of emotional cripples as they all try to put their lives back on track. The ending while hopeful is far from certain, so much so that I cursed the fact that it didn&apos;t go on another five or six hours, my sole complaint about the film.\n\nA word of warning, don&apos;t abandon the film until you get to the end. I wasn&apos;t enraptured of the film for almost two thirds of its running time. I was interested in what was happening but I didn&apos;t know if I liked it, and then suddenly all of the pieces were in place and it became this charming atypical jewel of a movie.\n\nForget Its a Wonderful Life, watch this instead, its so much more real.",

Sordi&apos;s corruption is so complete, his ability to sound convincing at every stage, that he seems to be unaware of what a lout he is.

      "reviewBody": "At first glance, we all know that this will never be a great version of The Three Musketeers but with all the flying ships and the swashbucklery, we can still give it a try. The film ends up pretty fun. Even with all the silly nonsense and the modern stuff scattered in the film. The cast made it enjoyable. The 3D is surprisingly good. But in the end, it&apos;s just another blockbuster. The film also had troubles to its pacing and the writing is a bit modern. The Three Musketeers won&apos;t end up as a classic but it can be fun in some times.\n\nThe baffle goes to the director. Paul W.S. Anderson is an unusual person to direct a film like this since he&apos;s more of a futuristic action movie guy. Adding some steampunk and plenty of slow-mos. The film didn&apos;t end up being too faithful to the original story. The director just wants to feel comfortable to his style. Modernism, Cool Devices, Hot Women, and Slow-Mo. The pacing is problematic in the second act. It shows the plan of the villains and in parts, you won&apos;t notice that it already passes another day.\n\nThe other thing about the second act, the Musketeers are mostly absent. It shows more of the antagonists and their plans. It&apos;s like Transformers where the titular characters only appear when there&apos;s danger and mostly focuses to a kid and the villains. But here, the titular characters are not bland.\n\nSome of the cast made their scenes enjoyable. Logan Lerman does his thing. Not quite appreciating though. But his female fans will love it. The actors who played the three musketeers gives plenty of personality to their roles. Matthew Macfadyen is pretty cool as Athos. We don&apos;t get to see much Luke Evans but he is cunning as Aramis. Ray Stevenson is as usual, funny and had much character. In the antagonists, Christophe Waltz has many style of being a villain. Orlando Bloom looks like he&apos;s enjoying but a little threat in his little scenes. Mads Mikkelsen is the only serious villain among them. Milla Jovovich does her swagger and seductiveness but a little personality.\n\nThe action is pretty cool. But so much slow-mos. Just like in Resident Evil Afterlife. Slow-motion to make it cool. Anderson started these excessive slow-mos in Resident Evil 4. Maybe he thought these things will affect the 3D or maybe he just wanted to be cool. It&apos;s cool enough but when the musketeers was helping D&apos;Artagnan to fight Rochefort&apos;s army, there is one moment of this scene that looks too similar to 300. When Athos was slashing them but here there are no blood. No matter how violent they kill, you won&apos;t see a single drop. The 3D is surprisingly good. It&apos;s almost like a gimmick but this gimmick is actually good. Swords, Bombs, Pointy Objects, and other stuff.\n\nThe production design is decent. The costumes and the setting are well made. The CGI were obviously good. The flying battleships and some CGI swords. CGI bombs. CGI background. The music score fits the whole theme but every single score repeats in every scene. The writing isn&apos;t good. Too modern. They said the S word but it&apos;s funny anyways.\n\nFans of the original story will definitely be disappointed with this adaptation but if you are in for some steampunk, slow-mos, swashbuckling swordfights then try watch this. It will not remain a classic or one of the best. It&apos;s not really trying to be the best. It&apos;s just a version with futuristic elements or it could be just a 3D gimmick. The movie wasn&apos;t bad as I expected but it has those flaws that aren&apos;t easy to ignore. It just wanted to be fun. It&apos;s good to watch as an action film. As an adaptation, it&apos;s good to watch right now but someday it&apos;ll be forgotten or ignored. But really, this is fun.",

That experience can never be recaptured.  I don&apos;t know why this movie doesn&apos;t make the midnight movie tour in college towns.  That way it might have some of the same impact.  Also when it came out in 1978 it is hard to explain how big John Belushi was unless you were there and saw it first hand.  It&apos;s still funny on the small screen, but only if you see it uncut.  Never watch it on a network, they cut out most of the jokes!"

      "reviewBody": "I had no idea what this movie was about beyond the very brief description on its IMDb page, and I thought it was going to be a little drama about the Irish poor trying to make the rent. Boy, was I wrong. It&apos;s almost a remake of Kentucky Pride in plot and structure except told from a purely human perspective. Taking the racing world from a different angle, we see a more cohesive experience with an ensemble approach that almost comes together well enough to work. The Shamrock Handicap ends up sharing a key failing with a lot of early narrative features, though, that really holds it back.\n\nBack in the Old Country the O&apos;Hara family is a landowning clan with tenants, but the family is beginning to fall on hard times with a tax collector arrives and demands five years back taxes. Despondent, the patriarch of the family, Sir Miles (Louis Payne) decides to take his three horses to town to sell to cover the cost. Ordering his servant Con O&apos;Shea (J. Farrell MacDonald) and horse trainer Neil (Leslie Fenton) to demonstrate them in town to an American buyer, Orville Finch (Willard Louis), Sir Miles becomes eager to sell at the highest price, but Neil, while demonstrating the jumping skills of the first two horses, can&apos;t quite say goodbye to the third, Dark Rosaleen. He botches the jump, but Orville can see talent when he sees it and offers to bring Neil to the United States as a jockey. He&apos;s eager to go, but his has to promise to Sir Miles&apos; daughter, Sheila (Janet Gaynor), that he will send for her when he gets rich.\n\nThe movie feels like it&apos;s setting up to be just Neil&apos;s story through its first act, but the short running time and plethora of side characters turns it into an ensemble piece. There&apos;s heartwarming stuff throughout providing pretty consistent entertainment around a host of Irish people coming to America and finding a new home. The first and foremost is Neil, hitching along with Finch and getting injured in his first race (just like Virginia&apos;s Future in Kentucky Pride). His efforts to make friends with the other jockeys leaves him with friends in the face of destitution after Finch had bet everything on him. At the same time, the O&apos;Haras and O&apos;Sheas come to America as well, lured by the overly positive letters that Neil had sent home. Sir Miles was happy to leave his tax bills behind for the promise of a new life in America, but hard work is what greets him, as well as a family of his former tenants who have made well and started a thriving business.\n\nThis ends up all clashing a bit with the story of finding family again in the New World not really gelling with the large race that ends the film. It&apos;s easy to see Ford&apos;s love of interesting side characters in this early part of his career because they tend to end up dominating the films, especially the shorter ones. If The Shamrock Handicap was thirty minutes longer, it would more clearly be about one thing (probably Neil and the race) while the rest would end up feeling more like support. However, because the movie is so short, all the different aspects end up dominating to largely the same degree, diluting what would have been the central point. None of this is really bad, but it just clashes up against itself.\n\nThe end race needs to be noted on a technical level. The corresponding race in Kentucky Pride was pretty much incomprehensible because it was filmed in black and white, without sound, and entirely from cameras hundreds of feet from the action. With the horses being so small on screen, it became impossible to discern one from the other. Ford learned a lesson there, and his horserace that ends The Shamrock Handicap is actually shockingly well put together. He used a greater variety of angles to sell the action, including studio shot closeups of the actors in front of rear projection to fake it, providing the audience with a view inside the action to help guide us and inform us of what&apos;s actually happening. It&apos;s a far more interesting look at a horserace than before.\n\nI think I sound like a broken record about ensemble pieces, maybe even closed-minded. Why not just enjoy the nice side-characters along with the central story of a jockey learning to get back on a horse? Because the two sets of stories end up feeling like their from different movies rather than parts of the same film. Cutting out the O&apos;Sheas and O&apos;Haras adventures in the New World would do little to affect the storytelling of Neil, and vice versa. They don&apos;t feel vital to each other, so while they might both be fine, they don&apos;t really belong together.\n\nIt&apos;s a step up from Kentucky Pride, but The Shamrock Handicap isn&apos;t quite the whole film experience that Ford was capable of. It&apos;s got some entertainment to it, but ultimately it&apos;s a bit too fractured overall.",

      "reviewBody": "It Happens Every Spring (1949) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nHilarious baseball movie has chemist professor Vernon Simpson (Ray Milland) coming up with a formula that will repel wood. He then decides to fulfill a life long dream of playing professional baseball so he ends up pitching for the St. Louis Cardnials and plans on leading them to the World Series with his magic trick. This film has gotten pretty rave reviews all around but there was a part of me that felt a bit off going into the movie because I was curious to see how a comedy was going to work when the main guy was basically cheating at a sport. Well, purist will have no trouble because the fact that he&apos;s cheating never comes into play because the viewer will be too busy laughing. After watching this film I couldn&apos;t believe that it wasn&apos;t better known consider it&apos;s about baseball, features a wonderful, Oscar-winning actor and most importantly it&apos;s incredibly funny. You&apos;d think the joke of a baseball magically moving around a bat would wear thin after the first time but it doesn&apos;t and in fact it keeps getting funnier as the movie moves along. I&apos;m not too certain how they did the special effect of the baseball moving in all sorts of wacky directions but there&apos;s no doubt it&apos;s one of the funniest things in any sports movie. What also makes it work so well is that Milland is, as no shock, excellent in the role. He&apos;s a very serious actor and he plays the part here very seriously and this adds to the charm and even helps us believe the events that are going on. He doesn&apos;t look or feel like a baseball player but that&apos;s pretty much the point of the story as he walks off the streets and becomes the greatest pitcher in baseball history. Jean Peters does a nice job as his girlfriend with Paul Gouglas, Ed Begley, Ted de Corsia and Alan Hale, Jr. adding great support. Apparently MLB wouldn&apos;t allow any real teams or real player cameos in the film because of the cheating but it&apos;s their loss considering how wonderful the film turned out and in fact there&apos;s really no need for any famous faces to show up as the film is strong enough not to need them. Bacon&apos;s direction is top-notch throughout as he perfectly handles the rather screwball moments but most importantly is Milland and the fact that you like him and want to see this scheme work."

It doesn&apos;t pull its punches - farming, science, hunting, the lot. Its probably a bit ruff n ready compared to todays production techniques, but every bit as relevant now sadly. Needless consumption of factory farmed meat, replica drugs, cosmetics etc create the demand for this abuse and its still growing. I thought at the time that this film would make the difference, but it was ignored - suppose everyone prefers blissful ignorance whilst the animals scream. Well I can hear them and its all because I saw this film when I was a teenager. Please watch this - you should know what&apos;s happening in all those big sheds you drive past on days out in the country - its not nice..",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen a Korean movie after along time even though my logic kept requesting me not to do that as its my exam time. But I have to say that it was worth it. Though the movie has a theme which is very common in Korean movies but it has touched a few areas which are rare. I was praying for the movie not to end but it end and left me very emotional. The coordination and contrast between Japanese and Korean is shown in a good fashion. The story moves around a Korean boy who meets a Japanese girl in Kyoto and many events starts to take place between them which seems quite natural. Like many Korean movies it starts with the comic flavor, get romantic and becomes very sentimental as the story builds on. The ending is something that everyone like and hope to see. If you are an emotional guy or gal then you may feel a lump in your throat as the movie ends. It also shows a few things about Japanese culture as most of the movie events occur in Kyoto, Japan. You may learn a few words of Japanese language and get a good taste it. One may not be impressed by the story as nothing is new in it but its a very good pastime and I am sure you will be entertained and thats what a movie is all about, isn&apos;t it?",

      "reviewBody": "Murder By Decree may not be quite perfect. Donald Sutherland is both underused and out of place in scenes that felt somewhat thrown in, the ending is a little tacky and lacking in mystery and the pacing in the middle has a tendency to be on the stodgy side. It is however still a solid and entertaining film. Murder By Decree is a well-made film, the sets and costumes are very evocative, exuding a gloomy and quite chilling atmosphere, and the beautiful photography does nothing to detract from that. Bob Clark&apos;s experience in the realm of horror made for great use, his directing shows him in his comfort zone. The music is very haunting and effectively orchestrated without being overbearing, while the script- while occasionally getting bogged down by politics- is thoughtful and literate with some nice bits of humorous banter between Holmes and Watson, and the story is complicated yet suspenseful and engaging. Apart from Sutherland, the acting is excellent. Genevieve Bujold is the standout of the supporting cast in an eerie performance and John Gielgud, David Hemmings, Anthony Quayle and Susan Clark are also great. The leads are what make Murder By Decree, with Christopher Plummer a very human and commanding Holmes and James Mason perfectly cast as a subtly composed Watson. All in all, a solid and well done film, worth checking out definitely. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

All the characters in the story become interconnected and realize that as much as their problems are personal they need the company of others to help them through life. The idea that &quot;you are your own worst enemy&quot; is thematic here and the quirky lifestyles of these Philly dwellers help ease the tension in what could be very uncomfortable dramatic scenes. Its been hard to find a romantic comedy that stays away from sex and the city like characters or tween indie pastel colored cult movies. Arlen Faber offers us a tasteful unpretentious refreshing and funny kick back film. And for the record this movie wasn&apos;t overly godly, something that I was afraid of when choosing what to see at Sundance. The religious themes are pretty minimal and I don&apos;t leave the theater thinking that I need to rethink my relationship with God or religion.",

      "reviewBody": "Although Rock Hudson did finally excel in comedy genre as well as his one laudable effort in &quot;Giant,&quot; during the scene where he is one-on-one performing with Robert Lansing (playing the maintenance sergeant) Hudson comes off a poor second. The quiet power demonstrated by Lansing simply staggers the imagination and causes it to catch its breath. It was not just a case of &quot;underplaying,&quot; but rather bringing forth such great depth to the role&apos;s character and demeanor. One of the most underrated of our excellent American actors, it is a shame we couldn&apos;t have seen Robert Lansing in many more, larger roles on the big screen in Hollywood&apos;s truly major films. What did the casting directors miss here? Much, in my opinion."

A roast goose from the gas station, a cheap sour red wine, a red cabbage in a most beautiful white color and an unidentifiable brown sauce...the dinner is a disaster! Edith tries to remain positive even after Jutta decides to replace her small Christmas tree with her big &quot;artsy&quot; white tree.

      "reviewBody": "Andre Techine and Eric Rohmer are my favourite directors, but I have to admit that I enjoy watching Rohmer more. I held the two in the balance, and the balance went towards Rohmer, for his sheer joy of existence. Techine shows very often transitory joys, especially at communal celebrations and like Rohmer he has pleasure in showing youth and its seemingly endless possibilities. Rohmer&apos;s very young women show seldom extreme pain, whereas in Techine male youth is troubled to the point often of despair. In Rohmer it is the female that he holds dear and in Techine it is the young male. But the balance between the two took a lot of hard thinking. Techine is strong on France&apos;s troubled history and in Rohmer it is not such a strong focus. In &apos; Les Innocents &apos; ( why am I the first to review it ? ) he portrays a toxic France where the Arab population is on one side and the French are on the other. Both sides in this film live in a balance of hatred/love and for the French the balance falls on the side of hatred more than love, even forming a &apos; militia &apos; to kill and maim the Arabs. This film is as troubling as &apos; The Battle of Algiers &apos; but Techine tackles the issue from a more personal point of view. He has his handful of characters and it is in this that the drama plays out. Sandrine Bonnaire gives a fine performance as a woman from the North of France travelling to the South, and there she is witness to the tragic world around her. She falls in love with two men, one Arab, the other French, and both these men are entwined in a struggle to the death because of the terrible political issues. Simon La Brosse plays the Frenchman; a young man tortured in body and soul. ( I have to mention for those who are unaware that La Brosse took his own life at the age of 32; a tragedy in itself for such a good actor.) Surrounding this trio are others; Jean Claude Brialy playing an equally tortured homosexual, and a deaf and dumb teenage boy who idolizes the young Arab. I will give no spoilers, but this infernal situation builds to a climax that I found unbearable to watch and that gave me nightmares. I never want to hear the word Coma again. This is a gentle warning to more sensitive viewers who have near death fears. As for the film in itself it is essential Techine and is a great film. His themes are returned to; the Strauss Waltz and its mysterious meanings, the use of rain and ambiguous hetero/homo relationships, and the magic of his imagery, sometimes surreal, sometimes unbearably realistic. I urge viewers to find this elusive film as it adds to the complete portrait of life that Techine is such a master in portraying. Life in all its brutality and beauty. To avoid this director&apos;s films is to avoid cinema.",

Noone is insured for not to get into such situation, like the main characters of that movie. And such people need help from those that were more lucky in this life.\n\nYou can clearly see in the movie, what a great impact that help gives to a person with autism. Loving, caring people near.. Strong movie, that raises a lot of emotions, thoughts and questions.. If you care about society, making world a better place, you should definitely watch this.",

      "reviewBody": "Any film that starts with Hammond organ music during the credits does not promise much, and in this Heimatfilm poor Sonja Ziemann has to put up with no less than three suitors, one more nondescript than the other; ah well, all three give very firm handshakes. This Heimatfilm has the most interesting love story I have ever seen, as one of the suitors (Paul Klinger, man&apos;s best handyman) falls in love with her when she offers him to run her petrol-station (no pun intended), thàt is passion à la Heimat. Another suitor is a former English pilot (reference to WW2) , whose visiting parents (the father played by Willy Fritsch, who has lost nothing of his charm) speak remarkably fluent German: in the Heimat everybody soon forgets his own roots.\n\nBesides all the terrible cliches of the genre and the utter seriousness of it all, this one has less than mediocre direction and is edited with a plough-share. Among all this horror it is Hans Richter who makes the best of it as one of the &quot;Landstreicher&quot;  and who saves the viewer from drowning himself in the Brunnen vor dem Tore.",

      "reviewBody": "To me, this is one of those rare movies which open a door to another world - in this case, the bleak world of France during the Second World War. The movie is in French, but as an English speaking person, there was ample time for me to digest the subtitles and the action taking place on screen. I found the characters to be well rounded and real, with only a few minor hiccups. The acting is superb and very believable. Surprisingly, for a movie with such a supposedly sad theme, there were a few times when I found myself having a good old belly laugh, even though this movie is not a comedy. The humor comes from the ridiculous, but so real situations and/or some of the characters idiosyncrasies. Probably a bit like watching someone consciously avoid slipping on a banana peel, only to be run over by a Mac truck. In my humble opinion, this is a very well made and highly entertaining film."

      "reviewBody": "Paula (Janine Turner) has moved her family to the small city of Hope Springs, after a divorce. She has a daughter, Sarah, who is sixteen and deathly afraid of dogs. This is because she was once attacked by a dog and she still bears the scars above her right eye. Sarah wears dark glasses on most occasions and is pretty bored with her new place of residence. A teenage boy in the neighborhood makes friendly gestures toward her but she will have none of it. Paula also has a son, Zach, who loves his new clubhouse. After finding two dogs in the woods, Zach installs them in his secret home away from home and hopes to better their lives. Paula, herself, works as a nursing home administrator. On the job, she meets the modern version of Nurse Ratchett (Lesley Ann Warren) and the nice visiting doctor. Zach gets the idea to bring the dogs to the home when an elderly resident (Charles Durning) suggests he can keep the canines in his closet! Meanwhile, some nefarious men are looking for the dogs, for they learn in the newspaper that the furry ones have been credited with curing illnesses. Outcome, please? This is a sweet movie but there is almost too little of the darling dogs! With so many story lines, the cute canines are not on the screen nearly enough, in this viewer&apos;s opinion. Then, too, dogs and cats are credited with extending lives, but it is never explained why the mutts in this film can actually cure sickness. Nevertheless, the film has a low key charm and messages that are welcome. The cast does a fine job, although the man playing the doctor is somewhat lacking in the male lead category. Warren is a stitch as the overbearing nurse. That being said, the nice script, costumes, sets and direction make this a good choice for any family viewing. You might even play host to another miracle, that of the whole family watching and enjoying the same darn movie. Doggone, now that is incredible.",
