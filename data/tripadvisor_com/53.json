Once I purchased the tour, I was given clear and easy instructions to follow on how to download the app. I was happy to learn that once downloaded, it could be used offline. The app worked great and was able to follow my movements and provide interesting facts with each location I was walking past. I’m glad I did this type of tour and will be looking to do this in other cities."

Expect some unbelievably good truffles, bars and drinking chocolates from across the globe. \n\nAs you eat and drink your way through local culture, your knowledgeable guide will share stories and insights from their personal experience as a lover of Northwest food.\n\nBy the end we hope you can express your own views as to what makes the Seattle food scene so special. \n\nCome eat with us!\n\nMust be 21+ to participate",

We spent a lot of time at the Snoqualmie Waterfalls, Gas Works Park and Boehm's Chocolates. We got some fabulous pictures with the Fremont Troll and at Kerry Park. At the end of the tour, we were taken directly to the airport. This is the perfect tour to take if you have a long wait between your cruise docking and your evening flight."

The fried chicken at Cookies Fried Chicken was amazing and my husband got to try Rainier beer while which is something he had been wanting to do for a long time.

Our fantastic and knowledgeable guide Will, took us to three bars: Bizarre Brewing,  Skål, and Fair Isle Brewing—all featuring their refreshing own spin on what it means to be a brew house in this Scandinavian town. Snacks—like Seasonal Skewers at Skål—were included at each stop. (Although not “Viking,” a bucket of fried chicken at Cookie’s Country Kitchen was too irresistible for our group to pass up.) \nAlong the way, Will brought us up to speed on a bit of Ballard’s history, taking us to see the salmon fish ladders at the Ballard Locks, and walking through its lovely park and gardens. We even made a quick stop in front of the National Nordic Museum to see its towering troll guard, Frankie Feetsplinters, created by Danish artist Thomas Dambo. \nIf you’re up for a some local brew and bites—and history—while taking a stroll through Seattle’s own Scandinavian streets, this is the tour for you."

It turned out that it was just the two of us and Laura on the tour,  but she treated us like good friends… she was so kind as to immediately flex the tour to better accommodate us, the weather, and a few things we confessed we’d really like to see/experience!

The staff knew him and each place had that welcome brew-scene culture.  He hooked it up with some great food, as well.  At the start, he asked us what we wanted our afternoon to include, so in addition to some brewery spots, he prioritized taking us to the Ballard Locks.  Will had stories to tell about the history and function of the Locks, and it really just felt like visiting a friend and them sharing about their city.  At the end, he shared some additional recommendations (and what to skip!) around Ballad and Seattle Downtown.  Great spots, personalized wanderings, and easy conversation.  Thanks, Will!"

The food samples were fantastic but the backstories provided by our guide Kasey were the best part of the day.   Kasey shared so much history about how Pike Place Market came to be as well as stories about many of the owners and employees you will see in the Market.  Six (6) stars for Kasey and the tour!"

He was so knowledgeable about the history of the market and the foods served there, but he was also open to learning new things like that in France the dauphinoise (which we had at La Panier and was amazing) is a side dish, not a savory pastry.  The tastings were great, well curated, and plenty to keep you from feeling hungry.  I only wish there were more opportunities to sit during the tour.  I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone!"
