Less bulky looking than other down jackets. Small fit worked well for 5&apos;2&quot; petite woman, though sleeves a bit long. Lake color beautiful.

I had about 1-1.5&quot; of extra space between my toes and the end of the shoe. I went to try on the shoes in person so I could exchange them for the correct size. I ended up exchanging for a pair that were 2.5 sizes lower than my usual shoe size (Euro 39.5). If you&apos;re able to try these on in person before buying, do it! I was also told by an associate that they have a tendency to loosen up and stretch to about a half size larger with use. They seem like great shoes so far now that I have the correct size!",

They fit fine but the heel area hugged my heel a little too much and sat a little higher than other shoes I tried.

        "reviewBody": "Just got back from a ride in this helmet and realized I hadn’t dropped a review yet! I’ve spent several months with this thing, and it’s the one on my head the most over the other options I’ve got in the garage. In short, it’s excellent. There’s nothing I would change. The fit system, while not a licensed BOA design, is a well executed one that I’ve had zero issues with, and is easy to adjust on the fly when I’ve realized it isn’t tight enough and my glasses start smacking off the underside of the brim. I LOVE the aero magnetic clippy vent covers, not so much for the aero benefits, but because this makes it a true year-round helmet! I actually started my ride in the cold today, and as it (and I) warmed up, I simply just reached up and popped the covers off and stuffed them in a pocket. Super easy, so adaptable. I have a 59cm circumference head right on the dot and I just barely sneak into a medium comfortably. I only snug down the ratchet a few clicks, which is how I like my helmets to fit. I still have room for a super thin cycling cap or balaclava. However, consider sizing up if you’re borderline. The fit is probably the most oval-shaped I’ve worn. I have what I would consider a normal ovalish, roundish head, and this one fits the longest and narrowest compared to my POC, Bell, Lazer, Giro, and Smith helmets. I wear a medium in all of these brands. Glasses storage is flawless, some of the best I’ve ever had in a helmet. If you’re interested in this helmet, reach out to your friendly neighborhood Gearhead and let’s get you rolling!\n\n#CompetitiveCyclistGearheads #BackcountryGearheads",

Great for early spring riding when temperatures are still chilly and removing the vents to get some airflow as the temperatures rise makes for comfortable riding—the opportunity to be a bit more aero when riding is fun, too. I purchased the Nani colorway and the finish has some nice design details. \r\n\r\nI&apos;ve loved riding in this and look forward to continuing to do so.",

        "reviewBody": "I really like the helmet for the features like removable air panels, fidlock magnetic strap, aero design......but it ends there. Let me explain. From day one after buying this helmet which let me say I did plenty of homework on my next aero helmet and it came down to this one and the Rudy Nytron with the Ekoi AR14 close behind. I went with the Sweet Protection LE version for color visibility. Was impressed by look and feel upon arrival but immediately noticed the rear occigrip did not tighten and hold, rather as soon as you dialed it in and let go of the dial wheel it slipped every time! Not good! So eventually contacted the manufacturer and fairly prompt response and they stated they would ship me a new occigrip system to replace the defective one. Has never arrived! Followup took days for response and their only defense ismit comes from overseas!  I get packages in about a week from even China!  Not acceptable in my book as it is safety related. I will be replacing this helmet and scorching their CS whenever I can as they either did not send it or have yet to! Doesn&apos;t matter......should have been state-side easily in a month. Buyer beware if you get a defective unit as to warranty being used!",

Fit is great, arguable one of the best looking helmets in my opinion, and it breathes incredibly well. Best part is the aero covers. I find myself wearing it with them off primarily, but as the weather gets cold, I like being able to reduce some of the airflow to keep my head a little toastier. Highly recommend this helmet.",

Light swing weight, adjustable for poling on flats, ergonomic hand grips, long section of ribbed eva form that is good thickness for gripping down on uphill side, breakaway straps if you get slid. ONLY suggestion for next version is a truly articulating basket around a ball (see the black crows version) that automatically adjusts to whatever slope angle you&apos;re on. THAT would be the perfect pole!",

Auto release straps means I don&apos;t need to teke the straps off in the trees. Very balanced weight and the rotating basket is actually a genius idea. I am so happy with them!\r\nCons:\r\n-I don&apos;t like the pink print, so I will probably paint over it.\r\n-there is a a very thin/narrow and kinda flimsy part connects the strap to the pole. It&apos;s already showing signs of wear and tear after 5 days of skiing. I can&apos;t see it last for long so I hope Salomon provides replacement straps in the future once needed.",

The drop was designed to be 103 mm as stated on every reseller website, with information from Specialized (so not the fault of resellers like competitive cyclist). However the company that prides itself in engineering and charges premium prices by boasting about the same could not get 103 versus 130 right. These handlebars have a drop of 130 mm, NOT the industry-distinguishing 103mm claimed. It&apos;s not just a typo either, the packaging lists the drop at 103 and the description talks about the comfortable shallow drop. Did someone drop the ball in design and engineering, manufacturing, quality control? Seems to be all three! Response to me from Specialized was that AFTER I notified them they checked and yes, it is 130 mm. But then, no solution, they signed off with a &quot;happy pedaling&quot;. In other words &quot;you customers don&apos;t matter and you pay the price for our mistakes&quot;.  So confidence inspiring! :)",

This was especially prevalent on anything nylon. Just for day-to-day wear it covered my seatbelt and my laptop bag strap with gray fuzz. I was pretty sure that if i were to wear it backpacking or similar I would have been left with no material anywhere in the vicinity of any straps. \n\nProduct returned based on shedding.",

I replaced an Assegai and DHRII with the Xynotal DH casing in the rear and Enduro casing in the front. Probably could&apos;ve gone with enduro casing on both and been fine but these things are designed for exactly what they claim; loose over hardpack, square rocks and massive amounts of grip over it all. The compound is pretty soft on the these tires and Im a bigger guy. So, I may go through 2-3 sets per season due to the soft compound but Im okay with that because the performance is amazing on these things. Truly what Ive been looking for in a tire for Colorado!",

Would you rather shout at someone; &quot;HEY LOOK MY BIKE IS CUSTOMIZED!&quot;, or whisper it with a grimace that makes that immediately triggers jealousy.  Needless to say - that&apos;s what these lockrings are.  subtle little reminders that you have paid the utmost attention to your bike.\n\nOnly reason this is 4/5 stars - these cassette tool splines didn&apos;t play nicely with the 2021 preload adjuster on chris king hubs (rear only).  you could probably file down the top, but I care more about my precious hubs than the splash of color.",

I did not have the chance to use them in deep powder yet, but I have seen quite a lot of snow in the glades and felt like I had a lot of support and float. On the groomers I had more problem than with my frontside skis, but I assume its because of the larger width and the more important rockers I am not used to have. Yet, I was surprised by their stiffness and the speed I could reach comfortably knowing they are not made for this type of skiing.",

The pockets are not like what is shown in the photo, they are only a few inches long at breast height so can’t put your hands in them, and very awkward to use them at all. Even putting a dog bag in them because it’s difficult to get in and out, and then you have a lump right on your chest. Highly recommend other Marmot gear, but not this one.",

        "reviewBody": "I have 50 miles of hiking on these shoes. They are a well made approach/hiking shoe. I would definitely consider this an approach shoe because it has the stronger toe cap and the sole flex is very stiff. They have broken in over these 50 miles I&apos;ve put on them on the trails and just day to day wear. Over all the shoe is exactly what I have come to expect from a Salomon hiker. Top notch quality. When it comes to fit, that is where these differ from other hikers I have had in the past. I will state I am a low volume foot (based on alpine touring ski boots and cycling shoes). The foot entry hole on my pair of Ultra Alpine X are larger than Salomon Ultra I have had in the past. And larger than Speedcross as well. Because of the size of the shoe entry and the stiffness of the sole, I got heel slippage, thus got blisters on the inside and outside of both left and right heels on my first 4 mile hike. This is the first time any Salomon had given me blisters straight out of the box. I have worn them with various thickness of socks, and I still have heel slippage. Salomon are my reliable shoes. I was disappointed, but also see what is happening. Ultimately this is a shoe that does not fit my foot well, and I am a low volume foot. I do believe a mid to high volume foot would work in these shoes with no issue. They design, style, and construction are top notch as I would expect from Salomon. I just will be looking for different models that best accommodate a low volume foot.",

They are a half size smaller than my Hokas, Lowa running shoes and Saucony as well as Salomon running shoes.\r\nI bought them for winter walking, daily wear and light hiking through the cold and wet PNW weather.  They are sturdy, stable and well cushioned, but there lighter weight options out there if you’re actually going to use them for hard use hiking.  I can easily wear a mid weight sock with my normal size.  I’m not a fan of the cinch laces used through the Salomon lineup and would prefer standard laces, but am a big fan of approach style, lace to toe.",

Regardless of that, i have wrote Gathr outdoors twice now and have yet to receive any response back in regards to a warranty for this tent. im very disappointed at this time with the lack of customer service i am receiving. My previous experience with buying higher end products is the customer service is impeccable, But this is not the case with Gathr Outdoors.

Unless the kids destroy this, I suspect it will last me a long time.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty lightweight and the semi-freestanding setup doesn&apos;t make it too difficult to setup, just stake out the base 1st and then it&apos;s nearly the same.\n\nOne thing that does annoy me if I haven&apos;t set it up for a while, because it&apos;s an assymetric tent, is knowing which is the front and which is the back for the rainfly. Yes, they color code the straps and loops and everything but more than once I&apos;ve been off by one attachment point and had to shift the whole thing and it&apos;s not hard to reverse the entire pole assembly thing by having it upside down.\n\nWhat helped me a lot is to simply write with marker &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; on the body and fly as these are the parts the really need lined up as the sides can be easier to get off by one corner. It just slows things down and if I have the little ones running around, a 1-minute adjustment can easily turn into a 5-minute adjustment as the kids love to sit on the body or fly when it&apos;s not suspended. I&apos;m all about making the pitch easier and I found actually labeling things made the process easier where there&apos;s only one-for-one point to match up instead of several.\n\nOh yeah, also labeled the footprint which makes things easier for knowing which side to pitch into the wind as the backside should be into the wind for aerodynamics.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this as part of a gear upgrade as I now have two kiddos, aged 9 months and 2.5 years that I wanted to take with me on backpacking trips. So I needed more room than my old 2-person backpacking tent had.\n\nI&apos;ve got to say, I&apos;m super pleased with this tent. The design is a little strange at first. You stake down the tent to the ground and rely on the tension created from this process to then complete the assembly, so in that regard the ability to drives stakes all the way into the ground is important so I bought a hammer/hatchet for that purpose. \nThe pole system is also a little odd - not bad, just odd - in that it combines the function of three poles into one pole system. It&apos;s difficult to explain in text, but it isn&apos;t that complicated and is really a clever design. \n\nThe whole thing rolls up into a bag instead of a traditional stuff sack which is also cool. You can unroll the bag that the tent comes in and use it as a doormat once you get it set up.\n\nIn terms of room, there is plenty for our family of four. There&apos;s a door on either side, one big and one small. Two pockets on the ceiling and two loops as well to string up a light. \n\nSet the whole thing up in 15 minutes moving at a leisurely pace. Breakdown / storage in the neighborhood of 20 minutes. Again though, this is also while dealing with my kids etc. If you were going for speed, you could probably have it up in about five minutes. \n\nI would recommend setting it up in the backyard before you get out on your camping trip though. As I said, the design is clever but it is not like any tent I have seen before so you&apos;ll want to be familiar with it so you aren&apos;t trying to figure it out for the first time in the cold or if you&apos;re racing against sunset. \n\nUsed it five times so far in 40 degree night time weather. It&apos;s kept us warm and I haven&apos;t noticed any defects. Overall I&apos;m very impressed. I also bought Kylmit&apos;s two person sleeping bag and sleeping pad to use with the family and recommend those as well.",

        "reviewBody": "The Maxfield 4, definitely fits four people. Maybe even more if you&apos;re willing to squeeze in or if you&apos;re smaller in size. Most recently used it on a cross-country road trip with two dogs. Plenty of space, even with two dogs that love to move around. \n\nWhen it came to setting up, my first time was a bit tricky, but after getting a hang of it, set up is easy and straightforward, even if you&apos;re setting up alone. The poles and it&apos;s corresponding attachment points are color-coded so even on your first time you won&apos;t have to fumble around figuring out which pole goes where. \n\nWhen it comes to taking down and packing away the tent, it does not come with a bag, instead it is a sack that rolls up. This removes the hassle of trying to perfectly fold a tent so it fits into it&apos;s bag. Place all the gear on the sack and roll it up. Next time you need it, just unroll and all your gear is there. With it all packed up, it is light and easy to carry. \n\nWith the assembled tent, the vestibules are awesome for keeping smelly gear outside of the tent, but also still kind of inside the tent. If it&apos;s hot and sunny, you can double the vestibule flap as a sunshade (it&apos;s not intended, but definitely works) if you attach it high instead of the ground. If it rains, there was no issue with getting wet whatsoever. However, I did not experience torrential rain, just light to medium rainfall.",

My husband is 6? and I?m 5?7? and sitting upright is comfortable but the front edge of the seat is firm and was not overly comfortable on the back of the thighs. If you slouch back it?s just high enough from the ground that we wanted a foot rest. So, we opted to return for the low loveseat hoping it will be the more comfortable option for us. Shout out to customer service rep who walked me through the return/exchange process and ensured that we could reuse our promo code to purchase the low loveseat!!",

I ordered this one thinking that it was the lower model, however it is working out ok.  Super heavy, so that limits how far it travels from the car. It is comfortable for what it is.  Wish they would come out with a new lighter model and maybe switch back to the shorter one.",

They feel nice for a rubber grip (I&apos;m an ESI Chunky fan and nothing will ever top those). These are much better than the cheap grips on Amazon and more comfy than the grips at big box stores like Target/Walmart. If I ever need a cheap grip again I&apos;m going with these.",

Typically I fit a Smith ski helmet in a Medium perfectly and in the Strutter I wear a M/L. I do have a averageish/narrowish head. Helmet is adjustable, comfortable, and looks great. \n\nEvery helmet fits different but for long days on the river kicking it with the crew or cruising some waves I always grab this one!",

The helmet felt like it was squeezing the sides of my head, but felt find on the forehead and back of my head, almost as if it was shaped as a very oblong oval. I could sense that wearing it all day on the river would be a recipe for a headache, so I returned it. It seems like this is a common issue for folks based on the comments below. Otherwise, I liked the adjustment features and look of the helmet.",

The chin straps are a little bulky but they also offer a lot of adjustment so it&apos;s a good give/take.  I have purchased two of these helmets.  The first one broke after two years of use...the break was a packing error, my bad.  Bought the second one without hesitation.  I use it for kitesurfing.  LOVE IT!",

I think I have a fairly normal head shape and fall right in the middle, even towards the smaller side, of the M/L size range. Without any of the extra padding, this helmet is bizarrely narrow and crushes my temples with immense, painful pressure. I read the booklet that came with it and had everything adjusted to be as loose as possible to start the fit process, but just couldn&apos;t have the thing on for more than a few moments without getting terrible headaches. In addition to this, the stitching and basic texture of the black cover over the hard foam shell is just not nice on my head. I have a shaved/bald head and it irritates my skin like no other helmet. The black material isn&apos;t very soft and the stitching at the edge over my eyebrows is downright painful. All in all, I&apos;m really disappointed in this helmet considering all the great things I&apos;ve heard about it from others. Maybe I just got an off one, but it&apos;s definitely not right for me.",

I use this shoe as a commuter shoe (15 miles each way) a couple of times a week on a Niner RLT RDO and just wear  them all day at work.  I like a stiff shoe, so wearing them all day at work is not a problem for me.  What is a problem, is that Ride Concepts told me the spd cleat would be fully recessed.  Well, if you stuff it all the way to the back of the cleat track it is, but I like mine about in the middle, which on these shoes makes the cleat just slightly proud = clicking on the floor if you do anything other than walking in a straight line.",

It&apos;s packable, a good value, and keeps me dry! I wear this jacket constantly up here in the Pacific Northwest. Only issue I have is that the sleeves come up a tad short, but most of the time I don&apos;t even notice. I&apos;ll also mention that the jacket&apos;s waterproofing will only go so far, but the only time that has ever been a problem is when I&apos;m cycling in the pouring rain for extended periods.

        "reviewBody": "Giro Empire SLX Shoes: Unparalleled Performance and Stylish Design\n\nWhen it comes to cycling shoes, finding the perfect balance between performance, comfort, and style is paramount. The Giro Empire SLX Shoes effortlessly deliver on all fronts, making them a top choice for discerning cyclists. With their lightweight construction, exceptional power transfer, and sleek design, these shoes are a game-changer in the world of cycling footwear.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Giro Empire SLX Shoes is their incredible weight. Weighing in at a mere 175 grams, these shoes are incredibly light, making them ideal for riders looking to minimize excess weight and maximize speed. The lightweight construction doesn&apos;t compromise on durability, as the shoes are made with high-quality materials that ensure long-lasting performance.\n\nThe power transfer provided by the Giro Empire SLX Shoes is truly unmatched. Thanks to the Easton EC90 SLX2 carbon fiber outsole, every watt of power generated by the cyclist is efficiently transferred to the pedals. This translates into a noticeable increase in speed and overall performance. Whether you&apos;re sprinting for the finish line or conquering a challenging climb, these shoes provide the support and responsiveness needed to push your limits.\n\nComfort is of utmost importance during long rides, and the Giro Empire SLX Shoes excel in this area as well. The shoes feature a SuperNatural Fit Kit, which allows for a customizable fit. With three arch support options, riders can tailor the shoes to their specific needs, ensuring maximum comfort and minimizing the risk of discomfort or pain. The breathable Evofiber upper promotes excellent airflow, keeping your feet cool and dry even during intense rides.\n\nIn addition to their exceptional performance, the Giro Empire SLX Shoes also boast a sleek and stylish design that sets them apart from the competition. The minimalist yet eye-catching design is a testament to Giro&apos;s commitment to combining form and function seamlessly. Whether you opt for the classic black or one of the vibrant color options, these shoes are sure to turn heads on the road or at the local coffee shop.\n\nThe attention to detail in the Giro Empire SLX Shoes is evident throughout. The replaceable heel pads ensure longevity and make maintenance a breeze. The traditional lace-up closure not only adds to the shoes&apos; aesthetic appeal but also allows for a more precise fit, eliminating pressure points and maximizing comfort. The reflective elements on the shoes enhance visibility in low-light conditions, prioritizing safety on the road.\n\nIt&apos;s worth mentioning that the Giro Empire SLX Shoes may not be the ideal choice for riders who prefer the convenience of a quick closure system like BOA dials or Velcro straps. While the laces offer a classic and secure fit, they may require more time and effort to adjust compared to other closure systems. However, for those who appreciate the timeless charm of laces and don&apos;t mind the extra minute or two spent tightening or loosening them, this shouldn&apos;t be a significant drawback.\n\nIn terms of sizing, it&apos;s important to note that the Giro Empire SLX Shoes tend to run slightly small. It is advisable to try them on or consult the manufacturer&apos;s sizing chart before making a purchase. This will help ensure that you select the right size and experience the optimal fit for your feet.\n\nIn conclusion, the Giro Empire SLX Shoes are a testament to Giro&apos;s dedication to crafting top-tier cycling footwear. Their lightweight design, exceptional power transfer, customizable fit, and stylish aesthetic make them a standout choice for serious cyclists. While the lace closure system may not be for everyone, those who appreciate the traditional charm and don&apos;t mind the extra adjustment time will find these shoes to be a perfect match. So, if you&apos;re ready to elevate your cycling experience to new heights, slip into a pair of Giro Empire SLX",

After my fifth ride in the new SLX l noticed two divots out of the toe on my right shoe.  A first for any pair of my Giro’s.  The new SLX is light with a glove like fit but the material is thin.  Compared to my other pairs I’m a little concerned about the durability of this shoe.",

Despite them calling it “ like new “ condition, I received about 1/3 of what I paid for it.   Sorry I wasted my money on it.

        "reviewBody": "Skied a half dozen days on these so far in Colorado in all conditions. Very intuitive and easy ski to read. This is a fun one-quiver ski for someone who likes to ski in a quick, light, and nimble style (fast and tight turns). Playful, forgiving, center oriented, easy to slarve. Very agile in the bumps and trees, carves well, and performs adequately well in powder as a soft ski with a relatively high amount of rocker. Relatively short turning radius (19m @ 182cm).\n\nThis ski is not for someone who likes to ski relatively fast, making big, wider-arcing turns. High amount of rocker and soft tips means the ski chatters noticeably though I still find it to be a good carver due to lateral stability under foot. In mixed conditions, the ski wants you to float over crud rather than slash your way through it. It lacks the muscle and stiffness for the latter. If you are looking for a ski primarily for piste skiing / groomers this is also not the right ski. It&apos;s a playful ski for more playful terrain and skiing styles.\n\nSo, this isn&apos;t a ski for everyone but so far suits me really well and I&apos;m loving them. If you&apos;re more of a painter than a blacksmith, you may like these too.",

I tried on as many different brands as possible and settled for the Oboz. I really like that they are wider to accommodate my slightly wider feet, and the support and stability of these boots is great. \nHowever, after only 2 years, the rubber around the toe started to peel and compromised the waterproofing. One of the worst things is to spend so much time and money to get a great boot only to have them fail after 2 years. The second worst thing is to be in the mountains of Wyoming with wet feet in 9F snowy weather....",

        "reviewBody": "I love my wide Oboz Bridgers, they&apos;re well made, rugged, and comfortable. I originally ordered the regular width version and the toe box was just too tight while everything else fit perfectly for my low volume duck feet. The boot fits a half size small to begin with but even going up to an 11.5 (usually 11) they were still too snug in the toes.\n\nSo I reordered the wide version in 11.5 and perfection! Just enough room for happy toes while getting a secure fit over the instep and through the heel. Love these boots for light to medium duty hiking. FYI, these are not heavy duty boots though and won&apos;t survive long if used for off-trail duty. But for day hikes on rough trails and backpacking these are perfect.",

My fingers are always cold starting in early Fall and my older gloves weren&apos;t keeping me warm.  I got the Hestra Moon Mittens hoping the extra insulation would suffice during daily dog walks. They are super warm and perfect for that purpose. They are thick so not the most dextrous for handling buckles and zippers, but the trade off is the warmth. The length from my wrist to top of middle finger is 7.75&quot; and I ordered a size 9. I haven&apos;t purchased this company before so I don&apos;t know if that is on par with their other sizing. The 9 Moon Mitten gives me a small buffer of space/air between the end of my hands and the inside seam, which for me is spot on. I love my new mittens.",

        "reviewBody": "Received these on July 18th, 2024 and have been using them regularly since, fit very well and true to size, consistent with other Altra shoes I&apos;ve used. I run around 15 trail miles a week in these and other shoes, did a few 20ish mile backpacks and an 80 miler in these shoes. Just like the Olympus 5 design, the strips of Vibram are delaminating from the sole in under 2 months of what, in my opinion, has been moderate use. Will not be warrantying these this time, assume it&apos;s a consistent flaw again. Why not just use a full covering of Vibram for the sole?? All of the extra padding in the heel rubs horribly if you have repeated movement in the ankle outside of the neutral position (not great for a trail running shoe). Have never had this experience in a half dozen Altra shoes before.",

I decided to try the Olympus 6&apos;s and have been very pleased. The Vibram soles are grippy and durable with the same plush cushioning that I enjoyed with the Hokas. The Olympus runs about 1/2 smaller than the Hokas which caused the hassle of sending back a pair. There was a break in period for the cushioned heel but felt much better after a week. I&apos;m wearing them for a rim to rim later this month and if they do well with that, I&apos;m hooked.",

The shoes have only been used for light road running and treadmill running, less than 100 miles on them so far and the tongue is already delaminating with inner foam exposed. The shoes are comfortable, which is the only reason I didn&apos;t give them 1 star. But for nearly $200 after taxes and shipping, you&apos;d think the quality would be good enough to last more than a month before beginning to fall apart. I was already planning on buying a second pair until I saw the tongue falling apart today. Incredibly disappointing and makes me extremely hesitant to invest in more altra shoes in the future.",

I love this shoe and use it primarily for outdoor F3 workouts in which we cover lots of different terrain and do some high impact work. Over the years, the shoes have narrowed a bit, but this one is pretty true. I did find however that the heel pad is problematic and actually removed it to make room. The grip is amazing and the only complaint I have is that the sole at the heel is quite wide. I&apos;ve caught it a time or two in the last few wears. I have a sz 15 foot, so I can&apos;t be picky, but these will be a definite repeat.",

I&apos;ve never had blister issues with the Olympus in the past but this new &quot;pillow&quot; just compresses and all that folded fabric and stitching rubs like crazy.

I purchased these for trail running on small gravel/dirt trails around the beach trails in the hills of the SoCal coast. Nothing technical, just a good sturdy and grippy shoe. The structure and protection level in the Olympus 6 is perfect- the toe has protection and the edge and bite of the sole works great. I was also looking for cushion and I would say the cushion is cloud-like. The reduction in fatigue from long runs is really noticed. The shoe is sturdy, but the comfort is level 10. By far my favorite 10+ miler trail shoe I&apos;ve ever worn. I have to order another pair as these quickly became my dailies. I work in film production and I have lived in these since I purchased them. And not that I care, but I&apos;ve gotten more compliments and asks about these shoes! The best- I can&apos;t say it enough.",

It feels like it&apos;s not holding my Achilles in the right spot so it&apos;s contributing to heel slip issues. If it was moved up a bit it would hold in the right spot and my foot would locked in. Would also love to see about 2 more inches in the laces! Going to wear these for a few more days to see if the heel pillow breaks in some, but majorly bummed so far. Hopefully the heel settles some and the lock in gets better! If they fit your foot and that pillow hits the right spot, these will be incredible.",

        "reviewBody": "I have owned multiple pairs of these shorts for over 7 years now and they are unbeatable. I think the fit may have changed slightly since the migration from Brion to Brion II, but then again I could have just gained weight...although I still have the smaller size and they fit, so either I stretched them out or a change did occur. \nWhat I love about these shorts is they aren&apos;t too stretchy or loose. You want the short to fit you with some movement but not just be holding on with your belt because they stretch so much. These shorts are pretty much wrinkle free and always look great. You can dress them up with a nice Polo and loafers or dress them down with a T-shirt and tennis shoes. I recently picked up the grey-blue color (I believe its new for this year) and really like it. Not Navy, but a medium blue with a hint of grey hence the name. I love that other than the zip fly there are no other zippers on this short. Recently picked up a pair of shorts that were comfortable but they had zip front pockets,.... so uncomfortable, especially if you place your hands in your pocket. The metal button and just overall feel make this short a long term staple in your wardrobe.",

Easy on/easy off. It&apos;s only snowed once so far so I haven&apos;t given them a real winter workout, but they were warm and comfortable and dry.

The summer heat here in North Texas is BRUTAL, and every bit of cooling available is welcomed; this top should be quite breathable, and also useful as a base layer in cooler weather. Seems to be the usual top-quality Castelli construction.\r\nA word on sizing: I have a lot of Castelli items...I&apos;m 5&apos;11.5&quot; 34&quot; chest, 32-33&quot; waist, slender in upper body; most Castelli jerseys in size M fit me just fine, a snug &quot;race&quot; fit. Castelli&apos;s stuff seems to run generally on the small side - I&apos;d ordered this item from a retailer in Europe in size M, but was too small, had to return; this size L from Comp. Cyclist fits me just fine.",

Riding in temps running from upper 20s to the mid 50s these have kept my feet warm and toasty.  \n\nThe overlapping flap on the top of the shoe does a really good job of keeping out the mud and road spray.",

The soles feel great on the pedals (Saint) and interface (best way to describe clicking in and out? ha ha) as smoothly as you&apos;d expect with a Shimano combo. Feel as good on the bike as when hiking the bike. We will see what the winter weather bring, but good so far.",

I wear an 8 in almost everything, 8.5 in New Balance &amp; Saucony running shoes, 8.5 in my Keen hiking boots but everything else always an 8. I ordered an 8 and will have to send back because I need a 7.5. They insole feels amazing. I just wore them around the house for a little bit to make sure that I wanted to send them back. So sad that I have to reorder because I want to wear them now.",

Incredible system, the 4 point locking system makes my split feel solid - I literally can&apos;t feel a difference between my split and my resort board. The polymer does a great job preventing ice buildup, transitions have never been a problem for me even in cold/wet conditions. The touring brackets are just as bomber, the toe locks in solid and the dualspeed risers are a lifesaver for hiking the steeps of the wasatch. Kudos to the engineers at karakoram for this work of art!\n\n*To the &lt;5 star reviews: DO YOUR RESEARCH. The product description clearly states that Connect bindings need tour pin adapters in order to run this interface.",

This material is much heavier and has a cotton mixture in it and doesn’t breathe like the other capiliene shirts I have gotten that are Patagonia. It doesn’t drape as nicely and just like wearing a bag.  So if you’re used to the nice thin capiliene shirts that I was accustomed from Patagonia don’t buy this. I do not enjoy wearing this shirt at all. It’s much too thick and too much weight and doesn’t breathe. Can’t return it I have worn it to see if I can get used to it for a day but no. I am so saddened that I didn’t stick to the old and familiar and this one cost more also. Thought it would be cute but boy was I wrong!",

I wasn’t sure if the difference would be worth the reinvestment from my traditional Explorer bindings.   I’m really happy with how easy the Charger is to operate.  Blown away actually.  Just like  you’d expect from Union, they ride great downhill when on decent.   I keep these on my split set up and have now picked up a pair of Union Rovers for my set of Explorers to keep them in the mix.",

And It smells lovely to boot.  Your chain does get dry quickly in super dusty conditions so be prepared to reapply regularly.  But it&apos;s not really a big deal if you&apos;re doing a good job of maintaining anyway.  I just find I have to use it more often than some other lubes.  That said, this is one of my favorites to use.",

        "reviewBody": "This is the best key ring that I have ever had.  I have been using the Kanken Keying for over 6 months now and it still looks brand new.  It is super durable and doesn&apos;t get scuffed or scratched.  The bright color (acorn) makes it easier to find my keys when I am leaving home, but I also link my work keys to that keyring specifically to be able to find them quicker amongst my other keys.",
