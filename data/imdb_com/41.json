      "reviewBody": "Some movies require you to take the &quot;reviewers rule book&quot; and toss it.\n\nThis is one of them.\n\nThe writer/director Darren Paul Fisher appears to be one of those rare auteurs who releases a work every four or five years and then disappears or hibernates or goes back to his home planet.\n\nThis is an extraordinary film. Even now I not sure if this is a love story sugar-coated with one of the most complex metaphysical scripts of all time, or a metaphysical script grounded in a wonderfully odd love story.\n\nHowever, as one of the main characters quips in the very last scene, &quot;Does it even matter?&quot; \n\nThe film is mesmerizing and engaging and challenging. It makes the MATRIX look like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The scenes in the present with the adult cast are perfect and flawless, but the flashbacks with the child actors are beyond even that, they are hypnotic.\n\nA great film by a gifted auteur. Memorable. Enjoyable. Astonishing.\n\nHighly recommended",

      "reviewBody": "Few other nations can capture the beauty of family drama with such subtlety and grace as the Japanese can. Perhaps it is a blessed legacy left behind by the master Yasujiro Ozu who in his lifetime made over 50 films, all of which are family dramas that often dealt with generational gaps. Japan, more than any other nation struggles with the problem of generational gap, being a nation that has continued to endure conflict between the young and the old, the traditional and the modern. Stepping into Ozu&apos;s shoes is the acclaimed director Koreeda Hirokazu, whose films &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; and &quot;After Life&quot; has already garnered universal praises.\n\n&quot;Still Walking&quot; begins as a family reunites to commemorate the death of one of its members. With new members joining the family and old wounds resurfacing, everyone tries their best to pass the two day gathering with as little problem as possible. Sounds simple doesn&apos;t it? Well, therein lies the plain and subtle beauty of the film. From a few words exchanged between the grandfather and his new grandson to the laughter of three children as they caress a blossoming flower, these simple moments will linger in your mind with tasteful resonance long after the film.\n\nWhile watching the movie, I found it hard not to be immersed by the beauty of Japanese suburbia. I could picture myself - like the characters, taking a stroll on a simmering summer day with the cool breeze in my hair as the gentle picking of guitar strings play in the background. Or perhaps eating lunch and drinking cold ice tea on tatami mats as the wind-charm tickles with the slightest vibration. &quot;Still Walking&quot; is a meditation on life and death that may just move you to tears...without even trying.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching Ohm Kruger from the somewhat distant perspective of the next century and remembering what kind of ruthless and apartheid state the descendants of the Boer War veterans created after World War II you certainly have a different vision of the film and the time it portrayed and the time and place it was created. Ohm Kruger was a centerpiece propaganda effort for Joseph Goebbels and the German film industry during the Third Reich.\n\nEmil Jannings plays a stout and resolute Kruger who fought at the head of his Boer people for the life of the two Boer Republics, his own Transvaal and the Orange Free State. It&apos;s a brilliant performance as good as The Blue Angel or even the films that won him the first Oscar for Best Actor in the American cinema.\n\nThe best propaganda will contain just enough truth to make it believable and Ohm Kruger does have some uncomfortable truths in it. Cecil Rhodes was indeed a scheming rogue with big ambitions which were fueled exponentially with the discovery of gold in the Transvaal. Like oil today its discovery excited the British who had already pushed the Boers out of the Cape Colony. Not that his Boers were the simple yeoman farmers. In fact they liked the idea of gold on their turf as much as any British people. The film shows Rhodes and his company looking to buy Boer land, but Kruger wants a law passed forbidding sale of land to foreigners.\n\nWhat they can&apos;t buy they take. Which in a nutshell is the key to the Boer War. Kruger and his Boers fought back, but in the end lost mainly because of a method of war that was introduced by Lord Kitchener the British commander. Round up the civilian Boer farmers, destroy the farms and put them into camps to concentrate them. Hence the term concentration camps, invented by the British in that war.\n\nAll this was of course to justify the Nazi use of the same. Those camps for the Boers were no fun, they were not properly sanitized, people did die in them for lack of food and proper care. But what they weren&apos;t were systematic death machines used for the eradication of whole different kinds of people. That the Nazis perfected on their own.\n\nIn fact like good little Nazis the horrific climax of the film is the wholesale massacre of women and children in one of the camps that was commanded by an actor looking much like Winston Churchill, smoking a cigar with an English bulldog. Churchill was in the Boer War, but as a correspondant and he was captured by the Boers and later escaped to write an exciting book about it. He never was commandant of the camps, in fact was a new Tory Minister in Parliament when this was going on.\n\nWe also see a scotch swilling Queen Victoria always supplied with a flask by her faithful retainer John Brown who was already dead by the time of the Boer War. The Germans even when they had a parliament had a strong man minister in Bismarck and a succession of tools after him reporting to Kaiser Wilhelm II. Parliamentary democracy was not a concept grasped by the Germans so they were shown a ruling as well as a reigning Queen Victoria played by Hedwig Wangel. In fact she summons the Prince of Wales from the Folies Bergere in Paris to her deathbed to give her the charge of keep all the nations quarreling else they unite and finish us. And of course that&apos;s what Hitler was trying to do unite the nations against the only countries left in the fight against him at the point that Ohm Kruger was released, Great Britain and her Commonwealth partners and former colonies.\n\nIn all this very little mention is made of those who made up the vast majority of the population the natives of South Africa. British missionaries come in for their share of dissing when they&apos;re shown in one scene dispensing Bibles on one side and rifles on the other while teaching the natives to sing God Save The Queen. Later on Kruger confronts a native chief who has a British rifle. Just how many American westerns were made with the plot of evil white men arming the Indians for some nefarious purpose? But again it&apos;s good to remember these are the folks whose descendants instituted apartheid in the true Aryan racial tradition. Speaking of America, it gets barely a mention here, we were not in the war and the Nazis had hopes still of keeping it that way.\n\nOhm Kruger as a piece of propaganda fulfilled its mission. One will most certainly be reinforced in Anglophobia if one sees it. It&apos;s battle scenes and the scenes of the Boers mobilizing as a nation to fight tyranny from outside are impressive technically. It&apos;s a brilliant piece of film making, but the source has to be carefully considered.",

Watch it again!"

      "reviewBody": "Recent social history is very hard to capture through drama and Alex Cox must be grateful to have such a good plot device (a far from standard love story) to carry us through this difficult and much misunderstood period of history.\n\nPunk rock was born to be a cult. Through all the headlines and publicity the central music barely scrapped the US charts: The Sex Pistols one studio album only just crept in to the American top 100 and they  were viewed more as a novelty act than the next big thing. Only when the whole thing was tamed and popified did the thing take off, by then renamed &quot;new wave&quot; to differentiate between the new and old school.\n\n(By this time the Pistols had long since self-destructed.)\n\nIn the beginning, the Sex Pistols were more a private party than a band, indeed they often played them instead of more normal gigs. The original punks were anti fashion and anti everything, attracting misfits of all kinds and colours; although art and fashion students made up the majority. This really was an open house with prostitutes, homosexuals and exhibtionists being equally welcome.\n\n(This is accurately depicted in the movie.)\n\nSid and Nancy were from this hanging-on group and although joining the group as bassist  and groupie respectively (Nancy tried to get it on with most of the band) they were never more than window dressing. The Pistol sound was Lydon/Rotten&apos;s voice and Steve Jones&apos;s power chords. Sid never even played on the records.\n\nIt is notable that many icons manage to have an icon haircut (Elvis, Rolling Stones, Beatles all set hair fashions) and amazingly SV even managed one himself with his perfect spikes. His look, his life and his early death made him a cult, but he didn&apos;t leave a legacy behind other than a series of half-hearted drunken rants.\n\nHard to see how Oldman could do more to be Vicious other than lose a few years. SV died at 21 and Oldman is clearly older (28 at the time of filming), but that is my only quibble. Chloe Webb (as Nancy) is also good, but annoying, like a dog that won&apos;t shut up barking and chewing the furniture, until you just accept it. A life consisting of drugs, sex and TV - often consumed all at the same time.\n\nAlex Cox&apos;s direction (possibly because he knew the punk movement first hand rather than through the papers) is first rate - like Quentin Tarantino lite - but he is  just as much a flash-in-the-pan as Sid and Nancy himself. He can&apos;t make a mainstream movie, because all he is interested in is man&apos;s ugly underbelly and without major acting talent these things look self-indulgent and even amateurish.\n\nHowever this is a moral look at drug taking - not the &quot;fun before it gets serious&quot; moral - the &quot;its never a good idea full stop&quot; one. Sid is a child, Nancy is barely any more than a child, but more street-wise. Too lazy for work she used oral sex like most people use a credit card.\n\n I like this film because it has something to say about undeserved fame, what you do (or the few choices you have) after your fifteen minutes is up and how empty headed people with no agenda get treated in this big bad world. Whether you want to spend time learning all this is up to you, but it is very well done if you do.",

The actors are doing an OK job, and the lead actress is a beauty.\n\nThe CGI is OK, and the sets have that dark gloomy mood to it. The action sequences was OK choreographed as well.\n\nIf you like CP movies, then why not. Just don&apos;t expect Bladerunner, though even that was deemed doomed in its day. This is a paced action flick, with some love and emotion in to it."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I&apos;ve seen in some time.\n\nTo have a good movie, you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever.\n\nAnother thing, there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won&apos;t say who), the book makes it clear that it&apos;s a long, soul-searching process. In the film it&apos;s quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again, I won&apos;t say who), it seems artificial.\n\nI realize as a Christian it&apos;s unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I can&apos;t in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would&apos;ve been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind, but that&apos;s the way I see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Jerry Warren, Harold Daniels and (if we can believe the credits) Reginald LeBorg all had something to do with putting this movie together. Jerry is famous for importing Mexican movies, adding new scenes and releasing them as &quot;new&quot;. CREATURE OF THE WALKING DEAD and CURSE OF THE STONE HAND come quickly to mind. He also directed MAN BEAST and introduced to world to &quot;Rock Madison&quot; an actor who never really existed! Harold Daniels directed the original version of BAYOU (1956) which was spiced up with &quot;Adults Only&quot; footage a few years later and re-released as POOR WHITE TRASH. Reginald LeBorg had worked with stars Lon Chaney and John Carradine previously in things like DEAD MAN&apos;S EYES, THE MUMMY&apos;S GHOST and THE BLACK SLEEP. The combination of these three culminates with a movie that is . . . well . . .unusual to say the least.\n\nThe small town of Wydeburn (it seems to only have 20 residents) is controlled by the feuding DeSade family. The good warlock Andre (John Carradine) controls half the citizens and bad warlock Belial (Lon Chaney) rules the others. Andre tells us that Belial has a cloven hoof but we never see it. Chaney&apos;s limp is no doubt due to an attack of gout which he was plagued with for the last years of his life. He does sport a nice pair of horns though. Another member of the family is supposed to be a werewolf and to be fair we do get a brief insert shot of the man wearing what is meant (I guess) to be a werewolf mask! Another DeSade brother (Tom Drake, who costarred with Chaney in THE CYCLOPS back in 1957) comes home with a doctor colleague (Andrea King, best remembered from THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS) to save his sister (Delores Faith) from what he believes is the family madness. Without spoiling too much of the plot (actually the directors did that themselves!) he soon learns that not all of Life&apos;s mysteries can be explained away in medical books!\n\nContinuity is barely there and scenes jump around so much you have to wonder who did the editing. At one moment Carradine declares he is tired and must rest yet in the very next scene he is in the living room talking about the family history! Watch how Delores Faith is wearing high heels when she leaves Carradine&apos;s house but is barefoot when she arrives at Chaney&apos;s place. Everyone I this picture had experience with the genre and I can only assume they did the best they could with a budget that from probably non existent from Day One and three directors all going in different directions. Katherine Victor from THE CAPE CANAVERAL MONSTERS shows up long enough to initiate a new member into Belial&apos;s coven. One name &quot;Adults Only&quot; star Sabrina (qv THE ICE HOUSE)shows up as a harem dancer.\n\nIf you think Roger Corman&apos;s THE TERROR (1963) is all over the map plotwise sit down and try to watch this movie! It&apos;s too incoherent to even to be funny. Oh well, call me a completist but I&apos;ll watch anything with Lon and John in it. Nice try, guys.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie over the internet so the streaming video quality left a lot to be desired; still I think I got a pretty good idea of it. It was one of the last movies Franco made before he and Lina Romay dove headfirst into the Spanish hardcore porno industry, not emerging until the late 90&apos;s to do a bunch of crappy shot-on-video &quot;comeback&quot; projects with American scream queens and fanboys that they&apos;d obviously met at international horror conventions. Personally, I always felt Franco&apos;s career had been in a long, slow decline since the early 70&apos;s when Soledad Miranda died. This movie, only marginally better than the aforementioned hardcore and SOV flicks, is yet more evidence of that.\n\nEven for a Franco film, it&apos;s pretty plot less taking place at some seaside brothel where beautiful women are held as sex slaves and forced to do various erotic performances for the jaded European client√®le. &quot;Linda&quot; is actually the younger sister of one of the performers and more of a secondary character. She flees her boarding school ostensibly to rescue her sister, but stops at a friend&apos;s house for some reason where she falls in love with a friend&apos;s brother and takes time to frolic in the surf with him while her sister&apos;s life is in imminent danger. It really seems like two different movies (both of which are pretty boring) until the end when everything comes together in a pretty unsatisfying denouement.\n\nLinda is played by Katja Bienert, one of strangest actresses Franco ever worked with. As slimy as it is when directors like Larry Clark cast twenty-year-old actresses that look fourteen, it at least makes more sense than casting someone like Bienert who easily looks twenty, but was only fourteen at the time! (I originally thought the IMDb info. that she was born in 1966 was a mistake, but the real actress recently wrote a letter to &quot;Video Watchdog&quot; magazine confirming that she really was that young). For what it&apos;s worth Franco keeps her out of the graphic sex scenes here, but her character is so superfluous to the whole story I don&apos;t why she was in the movie at all (let alone the title character). All the other characters, including the older sister, are pretty attractive but are obviously German sex performers rather than actors. I definitely wouldn&apos;t recommend buying this no doubt hard-to-find title even if you&apos;re a Franco fan, but it&apos;s worth watching over the internet I guess."

      "reviewBody": "To think that I used to accuse King Hu of doing injustice to the wuxia genre with boring storytelling and slow action, I must have been on crack at the time--as his best works completely transcend elements of conventional film-making. In A TOUCH OF ZEN, It&apos;s not the story or the action that stands out; although they are part of the system, they are secondary to the theme of spiritual enlightenment, which is what counts in Buddhist philosophy. When the abbot confronts the East Chamber agent, the art of combat is strictly utilized by the abbot to guide the agent to &quot;put down his sword, and attain peace with Buddha.&quot; There is a haunting sight when the bookworm scholar is amused by his tactic which fooled the agents. He thinks he has reached the peak of perfection, but then he sees dead bodies lying around who have suffered from his tactic, and the only thing on his mind is a woman whom he lusts. As book-smart as he is, he still suffers from worldly affair like everyone else. Only at the end when he accepts Buddha is he able to live in peace.\n\nAside from the philosophical points, ZEN also scores strongly in establishing mood, suspense, and fascinating visuals. The Jiang Hu in this film feels incredibly authentic, and the rich mise-en-scene is refreshing compared to the limited Shaw Bros studio offerings. I loved the photography throughout; it beautifully captures the spiritual wonder of ancient Orient. In framing still shots, King Hu chiefly employs medium and medium close-ups, mounting his camera at an upward angle so we can always see beyond the characters, perhaps to suggest existence of higher wisdom.\n\nOne observation I would like to propose is that although ZEN is probably a milestone in Chinese cinema, it would be a minor masterpiece compared to the best works from 60s Japan. The lush photography and haunting images from KWAIDAN come to mind as a comparison. No doubt, King Hu also learned a few tricks from the likes of Kurosawa, such as pointing his camera at the sun which occurs frequently in ZEN.\n\n[9/10]"

      "reviewBody": "I was curious about this movie since it had caused so much controversy with Tom Cruise in the main role. Personally I think he was after all not a bad choice for this part and all in all I am very happy that there is an American movie that shows the different side of Germany and Germans in the Third Reich (there was a time when in every Hollywood Movie the villain were always Germans). But Americans, who in general don&apos;t really have much understanding of history, fail to realize that Hitler wasn&apos;t voted into power by the people. As a matter of fact, he only received 36,8 % of the votes in the election. Though this made his party the leading one, he could only gain power because the¬†politicians of the other parties thought they could control him. Once Hitler was able to turn Germany into a dictatorship, it was extremely difficult to form any resistance. So much as cracking a joke about the Fuehrer was reason enough to be imprisoned, investigated and executed. Organizing a conspiracy meant risking not only your life, but the life of everyone even remotely associated with you. And you could never be sure who you could trust or who might be a spy or simply rat you out for personal gain. This is where this movie falls a little short, because it shows Stauffenberg and others simply talking freely about their plans and their convictions. Yes, I get that it is very difficult to portrait this conflict and the tremendous danger in a two hour movie, but I can&apos;t help it, I just feel that it doesn&apos;t give the audience a real picture of how daring this operation was and how nerve wracking this must have been (remember, this was the third attempt of Stauffenberg. He had the explosives with him two times before and had to abort ... each time risking detection). If you really think this through, you can not have enough respect for their courage. And I can&apos;t help but to point out, that most people don&apos;t even have the civil courage to demonstrate and protest in a free country with a democratic government.\n\nBottom line: great movie and you should watch it. Just be reminded, that this is a very watered down version of history.",

Suddenly Buddy shows that he too can play, but at the same time there are two kidnappers around trying to find animals to act in their circus and they intend on snatching Buddy. When Josh&apos;s team the Timberwolves land in the finals with Buddy&apos;s help Patrick proposes to Jackie. Josh sees this he runs away from home and Buddy goes missing. I found it strange seeing a dog play for a team not that I live in America nor do I know too much about the rules to American football and I never thought I would see a dog play in a team, but miracles do happen...that and a good dog trainer...Good movie very suitable for kids.",

Unfortunately those scenes are few and far between. Additionally the ghost instead of being scary is just... funny. There is one scene which builds up superbly (the scene on the stairs), but when you see the ghost all scare factor dissipates\n\nThe script however is nice and given better acting and directing (plus some more cash budgetwise) this movie could really do some rounds across the Asian horror loving international audience.\n\nMost of what works is the premise of an teenage orphan being left by her sister to live by herself in a rundown and creepy apartment. The detachment makes you wonder if she is truly being haunted or is this just a reaction to the feeling of being abandoned by her sister.",

      "reviewBody": "A funky little film that was the first effort by &quot;Mummy&quot; director Stephen Sommers. Cliched, unbelievable plot is played in a light-hearted manner by leads Matt Lattanzi (My Tutor) and Loryn Locklin. Co-star Grant Heslov later had a major role in &quot;Congo&quot;, while veteran character actors M. Emmett Walsh and Geoffrey Lewis are recognizable from various roles in other films. Somewhat of an ode to director Sommers&apos; hometown of St. Cloud, MN, the film&apos;s plot involves high-school kids trying to raise money for their school through illegal road races. Yeah, right. The film is helped by a great soundtrack of 50&apos;s &amp; 60&apos;s teenybopper staples, and by the fact that none of the major players take themselves too seriously. Trivia alert: Matt Lattanzi is the ex-husband of Australian songstress Olivia Newton-John. Oh, and by the way, being that this was filmed in St. Cloud, yours truly has a &quot;blink and you&apos;ll miss it&quot; cameo in one of the football scenes&apos; crowd shots. (As if anybody CARES, I&apos;m wearing a red winter jacket and ski mask.)"

      "reviewBody": "Excruciatingly bad. That&apos;s my takeaway from this movie. As other critics have stated, this is just one big infomercial for Steve Harvey&apos;s book. I will go a step further and say it&apos;s a big ol&apos; &quot;that-a-boy&quot; from Steve to himself. Gag me now.\n\nThe plot is non-existent. The &quot;movie&quot; is just an array of vignettes that sloppily intersect and form silly lessons from the &quot;great one&quot; (Harvey) about relationships. The characters are just there. There is no real development except the trite, predictable &quot;I see the light now&quot; that brings the manufactured happy endings to each vignette. The writing is HORRIBLE. The production is low-budget. The list goes on of things that make this &quot;movie&quot; forgettable.\n\nHowever,there are small but significant peeps of light through the otherwise dark cloud that is this ode to Harvey. The all-star cast tries really hard and sometimes succeeds at making this horrible script entertaining. I will highlight Michael Ealy&apos;s character as a ray of sunshine. The combination of his looks including those piercing eyes and his acting chops make his character appealing and dreamy, despite his being mismatched with the older-looking Taraji Henson. Gabrielle Union does a decent job with her character and she and her beau have the most interesting, believable story line of the movie. The numerous cameos would be kind of cute if they didn&apos;t leave you with the impression that their inclusion is just yet another way for &quot;the great one&quot; to show he is &quot;somebody&quot; and that he &quot;knows people.&quot; I digress as I find myself getting back to the negative even in the paragraph I had reserved to show the few positives of the movie.\n\nBottom line, this is an ego-driven &quot;I love myself&quot; fest of Steve Harvey. I am wholly disappointed in the Rainforest crew who produced it, as I thought they would have grown more in their movie-making than they have apparently. They are still putting out low-budget, poorly-constructed films. It seems the only difference is that they are getting paid more now to do so. It&apos;s a shame. They had the opportunity to make this movie a quality movie. It could have been so much more than it was.\n\nYou will not regret skipping this movie.",

The opening sequence gripped me and from thereon in I couldn&apos;t wait to see what happened next. The story develops at a great pace with some lovely twists and red herrings. Yes - some may see them coming but even so, it doesn&apos;t detract from a hugely enjoyable and often disturbing story. The direction and cinematography was also were superb - some great camera work and use of (sometimes washed out and grainy) colour and slow-motion. Highly recommended viewing before the inevitable Hollywood treatment. (CGI deer - ouch - &apos;nuff said!)",

      "reviewBody": "Les Visiteurs (1993) is probably my favorite French movie; I&apos;ve watched it loads of times and I think the entertainment value is through the roof. It&apos;s a movie that does nothing wrong, and I have awarded it a coveted &quot;10&quot; rating.\n\nIt was only a month ago that I learned of the existence of the somewhat low-profile 1998 sequel, Couloirs du Temp. I scrambled to find it, and now I have. I was afraid it might be terrible (as most of the few user comments here are certainly pretty hard on it), but to my delight it was pretty damn good. Of course not in league with the original, and several plot points were rather contrived, and a number of the gags went a bit out of hand, but overall I had a great time watching it. There were lots of laughs, lots of crazy situations, and lots of really good ideas. This sequel afforded us the chance to get to know Cousin Hube&apos;s side of the family, which I thought was brilliant. I think most of the inspiration and fun from the first movie were excellently maintained here, and I was impressed with the substance and complexity of the story. And I loved the way the soundtrack riffed the &quot;Back To The Future&quot; theme!\n\nI almost want to rate this sequel an &quot;8&quot;, but several factors contribute to its ending up a &quot;7&quot;. Some of the plot developments weren&apos;t great, and the end in particular seemed to just complicate matters unnecessarily, while not being especially intriguing.\n\nProbably the single biggest thing that was wrong with this movie was that Hube&apos;s fianc√©e was played by a different actress than in the first movie. This was a real shame, I thought.\n\nThus, a 7 out of 10 rating, but an entertaining and hilarious movie none the less! Absolutely recommended for fans of the original.",

This movie is mainly dialog and philosophy with only a few action scenes. The plot keeps you guessing and it attempt to subvert most common tropes, leaving you wondering who the good and bad guys are. I found the ending disappointing. While it had a great twist, it felt unsatisfying, however I notice the other ITOH movies are similar. I suspect the attempt is to subvert our common expectation of an ending, which it does well, but leaves us with an unsatisfying feeling. While not a classic, such as Ghost in the Shell, its well worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Arachnid (2001) 4 out of 10 stars Time to Read: 2:20 min\n\nBASIC PLOT: A pilot, some scientists, a few natives, and some mercenaries, go into the jungle... They all go for different reasons, but they all find the same thing. It&apos;s death, and it&apos;s form is arachnid!\n\nWHAT WORKS: *SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE AWESOME! For a low budget monster movie, I was impressed by the sophistication of the special effects. They are good enough to be believed, and there&apos;s not too much CGI, and what there is really works. It&apos;s definitely a throwback to old school monster movies, and that&apos;s a good thing!\n\n*DR LEON&apos;S VOICE IS AWESOME! Jos√© Sancho has the most beautiful voice, it&apos;s like cotton candy to my ears. I could listen to him talk for hours, he should do books on tape.\n\nWHAT DOESN&apos;T WORK: *LOREN MERCER IS A B*TCH Mercer&apos;s (Alex Reid) insipid whining makes her the most unlikable character, but we&apos;re supposed to believe Valentine (Chris Potter) is attracted to her? Why? There&apos;s no reason why he would be, so a lot of the movie doesn&apos;t make sense.\n\n*DR. LEON&apos;S CONSTANT SQUABBLING WITH MERCER HAS NO POINT It also doesn&apos;t make sense. Yeah, she&apos;s a b*tch, but there&apos;s never a real reason given as to why they are always fighting.\n\n*THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE especially in the opening scenes. I don&apos;t know if this was just on the platform I was using (Tubi), or if it&apos;s that way on the DVD too, parts were almost unwatchable.\n\n*IT FEELS LIKE THE NATIVES ARE JUST HERE TO GET ATE and that&apos;s not cool.\n\n*WHY DOES SUSANA SUDDENLY FREAK OUT, when she&apos;s been chill as a cucumber for the entire movie? It&apos;s stupid! Susana (Neus Asensi) has been the voice of reason, putting Mercer in her place, and remaining calm when no one else does, throughout the entire movie. Why then, would she suddenly freak out, and run screaming into danger?\n\n*HENRY CAPRI - ARACHNOLOGIST, SHOULD HAVE MADE IT Henry Capri (Ravil Isyanov), the quirky spider guy, who looks like Squiggy from Laverne &amp; Shirley (1976), should have made it. It seems like throughout the movie, the people you want to make it, don&apos;t, and the people who irritate you, do.\n\n*THEY KILL THE MAMA SPIDER, but leave the eggs, soon to hatch into babies? Capri says if only one gets loose, it could destroy the human race, but they go off and leave 100&apos;s of eggs, when they could just as easily set them on fire. WTH?\n\nTO RECOMMEND, OR NOT TO RECOMMEND, THAT IS THE QUESTION: *This is a remake of the 1957 Lon Chaney Jr. Classic, The Cyclops (1957), (available on Tubi). If you like monster movies, I&apos;d recommend watching both, so you can compare. They both are very low budget, but that&apos;s part of the fun. The special effects in Arachnid (2001) are much better than they should be, elevating it out of obscurity. It&apos;s a fun way to turn your brain off, but only watch and rate if you enjoy silly, low budget, monster fun. If not, go listen to NPR, or something.\n\nCLOSING NOTES: *THIS IS A LOW BUDGET MONSTER MOVIE, please keep that in mind before you watch/rate it. These types of movies have a much lower budgets, and so your expectations should be adjusted.\n\n*I HAVE NO CONNECTION TO THE FILM, or production in ANY way. This review was NOT written in full, or in part, by a bot. I am just an honest viewer, who wishes for more straight forward reviews (less trolls and fanboys), and better entertainment. Hope I helped you out.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Eaten Alive&apos; is a profoundly stupid movie, but despite that, or more accurately, BECAUSE of that it&apos;s extremely entertaining trash. It rehashes plot elements (and even footage) from previous Italian cannibal movies and adds a Jim Jones-ish death cult in for good measure. Italian exploitation star Ivan Rassimov plays Jonas, the cult leader, Janet Agren (Fulci&apos;s &apos;City Of The Living Dead&apos;) the sister of a missing woman, and Robert Kerman (Deodato&apos;s infamous &apos;Cannibal Holocaust&apos;) the man hired to find her. The cast also includes Paola Senatore and Mei Mei Lai, both favourites with cult/sleaze buffs. The version of &apos;Eaten Alive&apos; I watched was the British cut which has most of the more infamous scenes censored or completely removed. I really don&apos;t know if this was a good or a bad thing. I believe most of this stuff was recycled from earlier Lenzi films or &quot;borrowed&quot; from my fave cannibal movie &apos;Mountain Of The Cannibal God&apos;, so if you&apos;re familiar with this genre you&apos;ve probably seen it all before already. Anyway, most people run away screaming from this kinda stuff, but if you&apos;re into movies like this you&apos;ll find much to enjoy here. Neither the best nor the worst cannibal movie, but definitely worth a look."

Regretfully, the first half or so is quite plain and protracted, and contains questionable plot elements, e.g. why the police looked on the disappearance matter so seriously. Inclusion of Nazi topic into a Latin American society is not fresh either. True, there were some interesting twists, but the very end could have been more concrete or revenge-related, the current one created a kind of vacuity, no quivering.\n\nCharacters seems realistic, but apart from Clara Lago as Bel√©n, there were no catchy performances, preferable particularly in case of events happening in limited space. But all in all, La cara oculta is a far-above-average thriller, with its duration of less than 1,5 hours.",

      "reviewBody": "First leading role for Brad Harris - A sandal film about Goliath\n\nYes, you read that right! This sandal film, which was released in West German cinemas on December 8, 1961 as DIE IRRFAHRTEN DES HERKULES and is also known as &quot;Goliath contro i giganti&quot; and &quot;Goliath Against the Giants&quot;, is not a Hercules film, but was called that for marketing reasons. In his first leading role, the American bodybuilder Brad Harris, who was discovered as a film star as a visitor to the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, plays the figure of Goliath, who experiences various adventures in a kind of mythological magical world. The film was directed by Guido Malatesta, and alongside Sergio Sollima, Gianfranco Parolini also wrote the script. As a director, he would make many more films with his super star Brad Harris.\n\nThe king was murdered in Beirath. His insidious advisor Bokan (Fernando Rey, best known from &quot;Brennpunkt Brooklyn / The French Connection&quot; (1971)) wants to persuade the king&apos;s daughter Elea (Maria Fie / Gloria Milland, born in Sardinia in 1940) to be the victorious war hero Hercules/Goliath (Brad Harris ) is her father&apos;s murderer. Elea senses that this cannot be true, flees to the muscle-bound hero on the ship and has to go through many adventures with him before the real regicide can be unmasked.\n\nOther roles include: Nello Pazzafini (1934-1996), who developed from a football player to a stuntman to a sought-after supporting actor and later played well by Bud Spencer in &quot;Sie nannten ihn M√ºcke / They Called Him Bulldozer&quot; (1978) and &quot;Banana Joe&quot; (1982). Should be beaten. The former rugby player Mimmo Palmara (1928-2016) who appeared in the two Hercules films by PeplumSuperStar Steve Reeves (1926-2000) as his opponent and as his stunt double. The child actor was Gianfranco Gasparri (1948-1999), who as Franco Gasparri was supposed to become the star of the trilogy about &quot;Mark il poliziotto&quot; (1975), but was unfortunately paralyzed after his serious motorcycle accident in 1980.\n\nThe film was shot in Spain and in the Cinecitta studios. The equipment often doesn&apos;t seem that convincing. You couldn&apos;t really keep up with Steve Reeves&apos; films, even when it came to the script.\n\nIn the film, Goliath has to fight against a sea monster, the Amazons, a gorilla, lions and giants. Brad Harris (1933-2017) has a lot to do in his first leading role, which was to be followed by many more. The special thing about this actor was that he could do his own stunts and was later the stunt coordinator in many of his films (including the many German adventure films in which he appeared). This gave him a successful film career until the 1980s.\n\nDefinitely recommended for all fans of the peplum genre as the &quot;birthday&quot; of genre star Brad Harris!",

      "reviewBody": "TV&apos;s Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno&apos;s fourth in a series of Italian made sword and sandal flicks he starred in during the 1980s. Sinbad succeeded two Hercules films and one titled, The Seven Magnificent Gladiators.  He reprised roles played by US musclemen, such as Steve Reeves and Gordon Scott, who worked for Italian studios in the early 60s making loads of sword and sandal flicks. In fact, Lou&apos;s efforts along with other flicks such as Conan, the Deathstalker series and Lee Horsley&apos;s Sword And The Sorcerer were part of an 80s&apos; revival of the 60s&apos; sword and sandal/sorcery genre.\n\nThis version of Sinbad was apparently intended for TV but never made it. Beefed up special effects grace this movie version. However, any Sinbad film has to be compared to the three gems made by Ray Harryhausen, the most successful of which was The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad in 1973. Ray&apos;s meticulously worked stop motion special effects leave those in Sinbad Of The Seven Seas standing, and that&apos;s the point; this film is so wooden. The plot calls for Sinbad to bring home some special stones so that his pal the Prince can marry his beloved Princess who is being held by an evil wizard (John Steiner). He sets sail with a crew that includes a Viking and a Samurai warrior and overcomes such adversities as a laser beam shooting monster and soldiers that rise from the dead. His last feat finds him wrestling himself . See this if you like Lou Ferrigno (he still looks great and has let his curly hair grow out Afro style) and/or sword and sandal pics - just don&apos;t expect to be riveted to your seat."

      "reviewBody": "As the greedy, conniving Regina Giddons, Bette Davis gives a fascinating performance which ranks with her very finest. Tallulah Bankhead had her greatest stage success playing Regina on Broadway in 1939. Wyler wanted Davis to portray Regina with a more sympathetic &quot;hot house&quot; flavour, but Bette was adamant that the character was a witch in spades: the resulting performance is striking.  Regina Giddons is a classic example of a character movie viewers love to hate.  Carl Benton Reid is great as the equally greedy brother and Dan Duryea is fine as Leo the crumb.  As Alexandra, Teresa Wright is almost annoyingly innocent in the beginning, but she wisens up considerably towards the end of the film: &quot;Why, Alexandra, you have spirit after all. I used to think you were all sugar-water&quot; says a frankly impressed Regina.   As the alcoholic flibbertigibbet Birdie, Patricia Collinge is perfection personified: a truly memorable portrait brilliantly enacted.  Herbert Marshall is fine as the tragically deceived Horace who shouldn&apos;t depend on his &quot;lovely&quot; wife to fetch his heart medicine for him. A magnificent example of a great play transferred to film, Wyler&apos;s guiding hand is patent throughout: they definitely don&apos;t make films like this anymore - no matter what the cost."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Steven Soderbergh is a genius with a camera. Just admiring the shots, angles and movement of the camera in his films is worth the price of admission. Here we get a fact-based story from the book by Kurt Eichenwald showing us what happened when Mark Whitacre became one of the most famous corporate whistle-blowers of all time ... he exposed price-fixing at Archer Daniels Midland, the ag-giant.\n\nMatt Damon takes this quasi-caricature and turns him into a comedy act along the lines of Jim Carrey in Liar, Liar. OK, I&apos;ll admit, there is more subtlety here than in that one. Still, the voice-overs by Damon&apos;s character provide the ramblings of a madman - an ADD, embezzling madman.\n\nThere is so much comedy here that it is easy to forget what heinous crimes the senior management of this company actually committed - and how arrogant to think they could get away with it. This again shows that many in the corporate world are the equals of even the most corrupt politicians. Power and Greed are all-consuming.\n\nWhile, I don&apos;t know the details of the real story, it was interesting to watch Whitacre&apos;s interacting/playing with the FBI agents (Scott Bacula and Joel McHale). They want to believe him and are actually crushed when his game is exposed.\n\nA real Soderbergh touch is the casting of both Smothers Brothers in unrelated roles. Very nice. It is very difficult for me to believe that someone as intelligent and shrewd as Whitacre could actually be so, well, goofy. But it does add an entertainment element to the film. I will say it is not at the level of far superior &quot;The Insider&quot; or even &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot;, but it is quite watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "Jacob&apos;s Ladder is a superbly crafted film that transcends mere entertainment and becomes an experience much greater than the sum of its parts. When you watch movies such as this, you are unleashing very powerful forces that short circuit your natural ability to remain in control. Much akin to narcotic addiction or hypnotism, upon first viewing you will be unable to think, act, or even believe apart from the intense feelings Jacob&apos;s Ladder inspires.\n\nTim Robbins is Jacob Singer, a warm and genuinely likable Vietnam veteran who, in spite of earning an advanced doctoral degree, chooses to find employment working for the U. S. Postal Service. We learn in bits and pieces as the plot unfolds that his service in Vietnam included a very frightening battle, and the events set in motion on that fateful day parallel what could be his descent into madness.\n\nJacob&apos;s life suddenly begins to resemble Hell. He is literally chased by confusion, fear, and death, he sees unbelievably terrifying images, has horrific experiences that whether real or imagined are too frightening to bear alone. His only comfort comes in the form of the woman he lives with, Jezzie (the late Elizabeth Pe√±a), and his chiropractor, Louis (Danny Aiello). Each of these people&apos;s relationships with Jacob represent more than just the roles they fulfill in his life-they are absolute forces at battle for his sanity, and possibly even his soul.\n\nHis torment begins to include the past as well, the undeniable love he still has for his ex-wife and painful memories of his son Gabe, who died tragically in an accident (played by a young Macauley Culkin). As all these elements of the past, present and future collide in shocking hallucinations, Jacob slowly begins to suspect he could be the victim of a secret Army drug experiment gone terribly wrong.\n\nWith a haunted desperation, he embarks on a journey to find out what on earth happened to him-only his visions / flashbacks / flashforwards have become so delusional that reality and fantasy are hopelessly interwoven and nothing is as it seems. All that is decipherable is good and evil, life and death. And at the end of his nightmare, all he has to do is choose.\n\nThat&apos;s all I will share of the story. I&apos;m not going to do you the disservice of spoiling the experience this movie is. Suffice it to say, there is much more to know, and nothing left to tell.\n\nMeanwhile, there is not enough that can be said of Robbins&apos; performance. Although he has had &quot;more important&quot; film roles, never before or since has Robbins portrayed naked human emotion so effortlessly and without artiface; though this will not be his most remembered role, it is his personal best to date. Also in top form is director Adrian Lyne. Likewise, Jacob&apos;s Ladder is by far his personal best, though he may remain better known for his other more commercially successful films, such as Fatal Attraction and 9 &amp;1/2 Weeks.\n\nJacob&apos;s Ladder is not a horror movie as some may deduce; It is human drama, masterfully disguised as a supernatural thriller. The basic elements of Jacob&apos;s Ladder have been plundered several times over the past few decades by technicians such as as Shyamalan who aspire (but fail) to be artists, and franchises like The Conjuring that aspire (but fail) to be art. We have been suckered by flashy films with clever plot twists that cheat us on story, characters, and technical excellence, and in so doing we have lost the discovery of real feelings while the lights flicker before us.\n\nFilms such as Jacob&apos;s Ladder are set apart from the rest of the pack because you don&apos;t just watch stuff like this, you feel it too.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Liquid Sky&quot; (1982 - 114 minutes), film written, produced and directed by the Russian director Slava Tsukerman, can be considered a classic underground cinema full of fantastic realism. Liquid Sky means &quot;heroin&quot; in the New York slang of that time. This is a scientific fiction movie whose scene is the world of the fashion and the heavy drugs in Manhattan.\n\nThe plot seems comic but the result is surprising: a flying saucer lands on the penthouse&apos;s roof of a famous model called Margareth [the actress Anne Carlisle, who also interprets the androgynous model Jimmy]. A very small alien creature hidden in a spaceship of the size and format of a little signature TV antenna, captures the energies of the place, earning force through a substance produced in the human brain at the moment of orgasm. So, the extraterrestrial exterminates one by one, the partners of the model. These events are followed by a German astrophysicist that also researches Ufology. The film presents a savage sense of  humor and an elaborated visual technique through blown up colors, fluorescent makeup, melting forms, many neon and ultraviolet lights."

      "reviewBody": "Surprisingly, a lot of controversy has started around it in Germany. Many Jewish NGOs and notable persons like Marcel Reich-Ranicki criticize this movie, saying that making a Hitler-Satire offends the memory of all those lives murdered in WWII. They say, this movie ridicules Hitler&apos;s evil and therefore makes him human (Err, what else was he? Elephant?) PC-drivel. I couldn&apos;t care less.\n\nThe problem with this comedy is, it is not funny. Levy was obviously concerned about exactly these reactions and therefore included a morality play about Gruenbaum&apos;s attitude and difficulties. This in itself is a bad idea, but it sinks this wreck of a movie even faster by being overemphasized with no end.\n\nTo make a biting satire about Hitler, you have to go all the way like &quot;To be or not to Be&quot; did. If you&apos;re not the man to do it, don&apos;t try.\n\nAwful, boring, not funny, hypocritical, totally irrelevant and definitely not recommended. I am not a friend of Helge&apos;s surreal antics, but he didn&apos;t deserve to sink in this tripe."

Once thought a lost film, Venus of the South Seas was recently restored by the Library of Congress. This film has historical significance for the use of primza color in some underwater scenes and generous use of tinting and toning throughout and the new print was stunning. However, the melodramatic plot was tedious, the direction (by Kellerman&apos;s husband James R. Sullivan) was clunky and as an actress, Kellerman was a great swimmer. I was glad to see it, but once was enough. Viewed at Cinesation in Massillon Ohio in October 2004.",

Oh, and did I mention the rapids?\n\n&quot;Up the Creek&quot; just goes to show that the right elements in any movie, when they click, make the experience all the more pleasant.  For instance, if you want to make a movie about a bunch of losers that compete for their college in a water rapids race against college twerps that are richer, meaner and, in one case, more militaristic, it helps if you have a cast like mentioned above.\n\nIt also helps if there&apos;s a dog on hand like Chuck the Dog.  He&apos;s smart, he&apos;s helpful, he knows how to attack where it hurts the most and he plays a mean game of charades.  If all dogs were this smart, humans would be in a lot of trouble.  \n\nAnd those rafting scenes: top notch.  Not a lot of detail goes into most movies like this.  But when they go to that extra trouble, it works.  These guys actually did brave the rapids for this flick, the nuts.\n\nThis would make a solid rent alongside &quot;Animal House&quot;, that is how good &quot;Up the Creek&quot; truly is.  Besides, how many slob comedies do you know that try to visually quote the final scene in &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;?\n\nSeven stars and a twenty-one canoe salute for &quot;Up the Creek&quot;; it serves up the comedy.",

I was so excited to watch this when I read about it a few months ago as I interpreted it to be a feel good-little bit of sadness-overcome by fuzzy warmth at the end type of movie.\n\nI was disappointed when it was over because I felt more sad and unsatisfied than anything. For some reason, the sad parts stood out to me more and weren&apos;t dominated by what should&apos;ve been happy parts. I feel that they could&apos;ve done a lot more with this story and the incredible actors.\n\nIf you love all things Christmas, please don&apos;t let my review deter you from watching and formulating your own opinion. You might love it! I just didn&apos;t.",

Every character played different way to express best scenes and especially about Kajol actress and Prabhudeva and AR Rahman Music. I have been big fan of Kajol since Kuch kuch hota hai movie she is amazing actress and found few movies very such big hit in 2000s.\n\nStory is completely moving around one Girl and love story between two guys really much appreciate story narration. Prabhu deva dance in songs are big asset. \n\nA Girl wants to become Nun and how her life is turned, its a super story screenplay. AVM productions presented in golden jublee celebrations they don&apos;t forget this movie ever. Its a such huge big hit to All Star Casting Director and Music Director. so many awards won especially Vennelave Vennelave song its a ultimate song ever and beautiful choreography got a national award.\n\nAny way as a big fan of kajol i satisfied with movie lot and lot and found best romantic musical love story.",

Coming from Australia, and not Au fait with Scandinavian cinema and actors, I thought hers as Monica was superb. \n\nYes, it did get a bit schmaltzy, but, hey, this is Xmas time: how many Hollywood films cover this territory? It is a Universal sentiment, and, if it is encompassing of the &quot;gay&quot; community. why not? I did shed a tear. And in my book, any film that makes a 66 year old cry, has something going for it!!!!",

Plus he&apos;s not a very effective ninja. He spends what feels like half of the film&apos;s running time chained to a post in someone&apos;s basement. Jackson, who served as Joe&apos;s sidekick in the first two movies and then Sean&apos;s in the third, would never have settled for that. He would have ripped the post out of the ground, and then ripped off his own sleeves before pulling two giant machetes out of his underwear and kicking some ninja ass.\n\nSpeaking of Jackson, this is the first film in the franchise that doesn&apos;t have Steve James in it, and when he&apos;s absent, you realize how much he made the series in the first place.\n\nI did enjoy the Mad Max band of ruffians who appear mid-way through this movie living in some kind of dystopian society. I&apos;m not really sure where they are supposed to be or why they&apos;re all living like characters out of &quot;Ready Player One,&quot; but I could roll with it.\n\nIt&apos;s not like the &quot;American Ninja&quot; movies were ever movie masterpieces to begin with, but the third and fourth installments make you realize how relatively good the first two are.\n\nGrade: C-",

      "reviewBody": "Director Soumya Sadanandan&apos;s ambitious debut feature film, Mangalyam Thanthunanena (Sacred Thread of Marriage), based on the chronicles of a fresh matrimony life (especially in Kerala) is relatable to the core but is only letdown by its amateur screenplay and sketchy, cliched comedy. I am actually impressed by the lead actors&apos; - Kunchacko Boban and Nimisha Sajayan - performances more than anything in the film which goes on and on about a husband&apos;s dependence on his wife&apos;s not-so-much riches. He often finds himself at the mercy of his wife&apos;s gold ornaments which he pawns to get rid of his overgrowing debt that could one day bring permanent turmoil to their matrimony. How the characters develop their future together might make for a great watch for today&apos;s husbands but for me, it just is a haphazard comedy drama about the institution of marriage that stops being fun after the 20th minute. The comic relief by Hareesh Perumanna is noteworthy and so is the annoying performances by Shanthikrishna and Molly Kannamaly. If you are a couple already in matrimony or looking forward to it, get a whiff of Sadanandan&apos;s product and you will get a fair idea how marriage sometimes works. But don&apos;t believe everything it says. TN.",

      "reviewBody": "Er√©ndira is a dark fairy tale covered in the blanket of magic realism that has become Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez&apos;s trademark. Director Ruy Guerra has devoted a lot of attention to upholding the surrealistic undertones of the novel. The story itself unfolds like a bizarre daydream that follows a 14 year old Er√©ndira as she is plagued by the &quot;wind of her misfortune.&quot; It is the wind that causes Er√©ndira to burn down her grandmother&apos;s lavish villa. Upon seeing the ruin and ashes the Grandmother informs Er√©ndira that &quot;it would take a lifetime to back the debt you owe me.&quot; And so begins the young girl&apos;s life of prostitution. In order to earn back her money, the Grandmother sells Er√©ndira to countless men, day and night. It is only when Er√©ndira meets angelic Ulysses that her tortured life seemingly begins to change. Perhaps the most brilliant aspect of this movie is the role of the Grandmother, played by Irene Papas. She is carried around on a throne-like chair, wears grotesquely gaudy dresses and devours cake by the handful; all while dispensing cryptic advice to Er√©ndira. The power that the Grandmother has over the life of Er√©ndira is shocking yet morbidly interesting, as is she. This strong presence is the reason that her character commands the most attention in the film. Her greed and apparent indestructibleness is quite possibly representative of the many corrupt and powerful organizations and politicians that are present in Latin America and throughout the world.\n\nEr√©ndira is a compelling movie to say the least. It is funny yet eerie, intriguing yet grotesque, and I thought it was amazing. Everything from the sound effects to the costumes work together to create the web of magic realism that dominates the film. If you like slightly dark stories of Latin American culture with a magical twist, Er√©ndira should be your first choice."

The ethical dilemma of leaving a field of battle (in this case the Alamo)to try and save the lives of loved ones is a powerful theme. The repercussions to John Stroud, Ford&apos;s weary but stalwart character, are scorn, accusations of cowardice and worse. The best part of the film are the sweeping shots of the Texas plains. The movie is well-composed, capturing the majestic plains and hills with a strength of purpose that demands an emotional response. One of the early films of Jeanne Cooper, who is a favorite of mine.",

Shame it turned out to be ¬£20 too much.\n\nThe plot of the movie is basically a really watered down version of Jean Claude Van Damme&apos;s Cyborg, about a post-nuke world where three heroes, Mitchell, Costas Mandylor(of Fist of the North Star fame) and a woman I&apos;ve never heard of called Kathleen Kinmont actually fight Fender from Cyborg, now called Lucifer, but played by the same actor in a worse costume. Lucifer&apos;s little brother is the dorkiest attempt at a villain ever, and the movie is quite frankly a nightmare, with the only things redeeming it for me being the fact that Sasha still works, and that future Terminatrix Kristanna Loken has a small role(far too small).\n\nThe action is dull, the characters dumb, and the story rehashed from a hardly classic 80s Van Damme vehicle, the worst of it is, the movie has the cheek to not even do this in a funny way, it&apos;s just plain crap. Avoid this, and any other movies directed by Art Camacho.",

      "reviewBody": "The blatant plug first: If you haven&apos;t seen this film, you have deprived yourself of one of the great performances of all time. Do not miss the opportunity, order it, buy it, or just plain rent it at once.\n\nWhen I was a boy my father introduced me to this version of Scrooge. I can remember how we had to all sit very quietly whilst he recorded the soundtrack from our TV using a mike onto his tape recorder. From there on in, every year at Christmas the tape would come out and we would listen to the soundtrack complete with the introduction music to the adverts. Eventually the tape became a cassette and then we had the video.\n\nNow I am the owner of this magical film on DVD and there has not been a year pass me by that I haven&apos;t sat and watched the film at least once.\n\nThe joy of watching this version has never left me, and as other commentators have remarked, Alastair Sim as Scrooge, seems to provide everything that you could want in the part. The transition from miser to benefactor is handled well, with Sim fighting the spirits all the way: &quot;I&apos;m too old to change&quot;. The dizzy happiness of the final scenes in stark contrast to the character in the opening of the film.\n\nEverytime I see this film I find myself captivated by the way Sim manages to find an inner character to Scrooge, one that has not previously revealed itself. The young Scrooge played by George Cole, may not be the nasty money grabbing character whilst interacting with his sister, working for Fezziwig, or courting Alice, but he doesn&apos;t have that intoxicated happiness, there is still something sour about him.\n\nPerhaps that is what truly makes this film. If the novel is about redemption and a rediscovery of humanity, then Alastair Sim finds it in abundance within his portrayal.\n\nI cannot reach the end credits without undergoing some form of renewal myself. The characterisation carries you with it. I have seen and heard this film at least 50 times and I still smile to myself whilst waiting for the words : &quot;Cratchit! you&apos;re late.&quot; the attempt to keep up the old Scrooge breaking down very quickly.\n\nPerhaps some more people in the world could do with a revelation such as this Scrooge undergoes. Would it be so bad if we all felt at times that: &quot;I don&apos;t deserve to be so happy&quot;.\n\nThe other part I have always enjoyed is that of Kathleen Harrison as Mrs Dilber. Throughout she plays the put upon house keeper with great style. The comments she makes at Old Joe&apos;s are telling in their rightness and her initial reaction to the transformed Scrooge is bewilderment and terror in equal measure.\n\nI am relieved to read that I am not alone in this world in being able to quote almost every line, and some of the these have become catch phrases in my family: &quot;I always know&quot; seems to be a favourite of my father :-)and a meal cannot pass without &quot;ha&apos;penny extra&quot; being put forward if more bread is requested.\n\nSo to finish - let the enthusiasm of the other contributors and myself encourage you to at least try this film. And now to get this in the post: &quot;I&apos;ll send it to Bob Cratchit. Label, label, label, label, must have a label.&quot;"

And I have to say I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all.\n\nGuardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn&apos;t end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.\n\nI have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it&apos;s this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.\n\nThe plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie&apos;s long duration.\n\nThe soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.\n\nDue to the movie&apos;s high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.\n\nIn the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It&apos;s simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "About a year ago I was tickled pink with Diary of a Wimpy Kid, a film adapted from the first book of a successful series by Jeff Kinney. I suppose it did decent business worldwide to warrant a follow up film, adapting from the second book in the series called Rodrick Rules, where the premise is focused more on within the Heffley family, in particular between Greg (Zachary Gordon), now in seventh grade, and his older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick), while yet still holding onto its quirky comedy and shenanigans set in school.\n\nDavid Bowers, who did Flushed Away and Astro Boy, takes over from Thor Freudenthal to direct this installment of the wimpy kid, though still retaining some signature elements such as the animation design which come directly from the books. We&apos;re reintroduced to the Heffley family, and it&apos;s pretty amazing how the sheer amount of incidents and subplots start to take their own life, providing slices of life moments from puppy love to sibling rivalry. There&apos;s Greg&apos;s infatuation with new student Holly Hills (Peyton List) with whom he tries too hard to get acquainted with, his friendship with best friend Rowley (Rober Capron) taking a hit because he refuses to be Rowley&apos;s sidekick for a magic show in the town&apos;s talent contest, and the continuing bullying of Rodrick on Greg, one which culminated in the latter running around in his underwear at an old folks home. \n\nThose are but three of the many comical situations found in this installment, coupled with a house party that cannot be mentioned, but of course there&apos;s no smoke without fire, and what worked here is that most times things get set up for the fall only much later, coming in as sucker punches complete with rip tickling delivery. There&apos;s no wasted scene in the film, and everything sprawls out and collapses back nicely, in part I guess having a source material laying out a roadmap for the narrative to follow, with nice little easter egg touches that connects this film to its predecessor, such as the remnants of the Cheese Touch.\n\nDon&apos;t expect very sophisticated direction here, as it may look and feel like an extended sitcom episode. But in all honesty the little tales that make up this film are nothing to scoff at, made all the more fun by the myriad of side characters / caricatures. There are still three more books to go, and I&apos;m unsure if they will be turned into movies, though if they do, it better be fast before the child actors all grow up. Definitely recommended, and for its targeted demographics, I&apos;m sure this will speak volumes to them, especially on its message of blood being thicker than water, and how siblings, no matter the rivalry, will always be subject to a quick patch up.",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I enjoyed this deeper look in to that universe. The movie really does feel like one giant glorified DVD extra for that trilogy and I mean that in a good way. Deeper layers are revealed and the intrigue is as good as what we&apos;ve seen before even though the character motivation isn&apos;t as strong across the board. Renner is fabulous as the second generation super spy. My only real complaint about this installment (because it does feel like they are blatantly building for three more films) is that the resolution has no real teeth. Still, it&apos;s a very good effort from a very good cast with hints and touches to the Bourne films of the past.\n\nOverall, a thumbs up and a very enjoyable time at the cinema."

      "reviewBody": "This is Elvis at his total peak as a stage performer and ultimate 20th Century musical icon. The King has often been criticised at this point in his private life and career for one aspect or another - the separation from Priscilla, the reliance on prescribed medication, the extra pounds added to his waistline, the abundance of cover versions in his stage act, etc., etc. But what people fail to realise - here was a man who naturally was suffering with a certain amount of stress at this particular phase of his showbiz and personal life, especially having contracted glaucoma and having to cope with a gruelling touring schedule. Elvis might have been carrying a few extra pounds since MGM filmed him on and off stage in his previous documentary, but he still looked in peak physical condition and could certainly move and shake better than any would-be contender to his throne - check out &apos;Polk Salad Annie&apos;, the opening credit montage of &apos;Johnny B. Goode&apos; and the energetic displays of on-stage Karate routines. Elvis had just recorded some future classic hits at this point when the movie was being filmed namely &apos;Always On My Mind&apos; and &apos;Burning Love&apos;. The other songs that had been certified global hits just before filming commenced for &quot;On Tour&quot; were &apos;An American Trilogy&apos; and &apos;Until It&apos;s Time For You To Go&apos;. The inspirational album &apos;He Touched Me&apos; had just given Elvis his second grammy award in five years, and three of the gospel numbers on the album were to be featured rehearsal performances in &quot;Elvis On Tour&quot;. A couple of months later The King embarked on another concert performance milestone with a full weekend of sell-out shows at New York&apos;s Madison Square Garden - John Lennon, George Harrison, David Bowie and Paul Simon were in attendance. The album recording of the Saturday night concert at The Garden achieved gold status. Before the pinnacle of the record-breaking &apos;Aloha From Hawaii&apos; Satellite Concert in January 1973, &quot;Elvis On Tour&quot; had been nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Documentary - it ended up as the winner. So, as anyone can see here, there were so many high points that are frequently overlooked in the year Elvis1972. And, as for performing such covers as &apos;Proud Mary&apos;, &apos;Bridge Over Troubled Water&apos;, and &apos;I Can&apos;t Stop Loving You&apos; - he did them His way!",

Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.\n\nAfter almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.\n\nThe script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.",

      "reviewBody": "Each new installment of the &quot;Step Up&quot; franchise is a step down from the last. &quot;Step Up Revolution&quot; stars Kathryn McCormick (&quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;) and Ryan Guzman. The story is about a group of dancers called The Mob, which performs flash mobs all over the city of Miami. In order to win a YouTube contest with a grand prize, each of their performances are filmed and put online to get the most views that they possibly can receive.\n\nSean (Guzman) first meets Emily (McCormick) at a party and she eventually joins The Mob. However, they soon find out that some successful businessman is planning to tear down The Mob members&apos; neighborhood. This businessman just happens to be Emily&apos;s father. Didn&apos;t see that one coming¬Ö\n\nThe rest of the movie involves The Mob using their talents to protest and win their neighborhood back, while Emily is conflicted between her father and her new crew.\n\nMy expectations were pretty low going in, but somehow this movie is even worse than I had expected. Yes, the dancing is incredible and the choreography is quite inventive, but it doesn&apos;t make up for the awful acting and overly familiar story. Kathryn McCormick and Ryan Guzman had no chemistry, nor do they have much of an acting background. The plot is extremely predictable and the script is as cheesy as it gets.\n\nThe only enjoyable scenes are those that involve dancing. The rest is tough to sit through. There are a few cameos in an attempt to somehow connect the fourth &quot;Step Up&quot; to the previous two, which was a nice surprise.\n\nIf you loved &quot;Step Up 2: The Streets&quot; and &quot;Step Up 3D&quot;, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll love this one too. It&apos;s incomparable to the first &quot;Step Up&quot;, which is less of a &apos;dance movie&apos; and more of a movie that includes dance within it.\n\nI give &quot;Step Up Revolution&quot; a 4 out of 10. If it weren&apos;t for the amazing dancing, I&apos;d give it a 1.",

Excellent lighting, beautiful camera-work and the beauty of the backdrop of pre-ww2 Denmark, with its forests and hills and clear blue sky. With a budget that was unseen for European movies, the many different locations and expensive props, this film was one of the worlds first &quot;blockbusters&quot;, earning the production company over three hundred thousand danish krones(appr. 50.000 us dollars), making the director as famous as a danish director have ever been.

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s impossible not to like Jacque Fresco or to not be charmed by his enthusiasm. There&apos;s no doubt that he&apos;s a gifted stylist, immensely hardworking and sincere, and that he has synthesized most of the &quot;futuristic&quot; notions of the 20th century. You can see the influences of Bucky Fuller&apos;s geodesic structures, the streamlined vehicles of Norman Bel Geddes, Oscar Niemeier&apos;s curvilinear architecture. He&apos;s assembled a world-view that&apos;s appealing and might well be an improvement over what we have now. For that, he&apos;s something of a treasure.\n\nHaving said all of that in his favor, even his newest creations are dated and, almost without exception, simply replace existing problems with other problems he does not seem to see. Countless examples present themselves in this documentary.\n\nFor example, he posits &quot;cities of the future&quot; which are saddled with the problems that have always plagued utopian city planning, from Le Corbusier&apos;s &quot;Ville Radieuse&quot; to Niemeier&apos;s Brasilia. First, the resources, energy, tools, etc., required to create these cities is vastly greater than creating an organically-grown city. This is a mistake that Fresco repeats again and again. He posits huge &quot;prefabricated buildings, assembled by robots&quot;. Instead of actually being a step forward, all this does is to shift the labor and energy from where it is now (construction crews building on-site) to construction crews building prefab modules elsewhere, and then requiring the energy to move them to the site, AND to create (and provide materials and energy for) the robots to assemble them. There is no net savings; indeed, there&apos;s a net LOSS in efficiency, all for the sake of &quot;futuristic&quot; prefab buildings and robot assemblers. Every &quot;automated system&quot; he suggests comes at a huge cost in materials, energy, manpower, etc.\n\nSecond, people simply don&apos;t like living in symmetrical cities; they&apos;re soul-crushing. Every city ever been built upon a symmetrical plan has been a failure. Most have become housing projects, slums or demolished just decades-on. And it&apos;s far more difficult to demolish and ethically dispose of &quot;futuristic&quot; buildings than ones made of say, brick and wood. (Monsanto&apos;s fiberglass &quot;House of the Future&quot; defied nearly all attempts at demolition and even after being chopped up, became toxic landfill.) It&apos;s unlikely that anyone a century from now will bemoan the loss of the &quot;grid city&quot;, but people will always feel attracted to chaotic jumbles like Bruges, Carcassonne or Carmel-by-the-Sea. Humans are organic and they just naturally relate to organically-evolved settings.\n\nThird, the inflexibility of planned cities is antithetical to growth and change; two things that every city needs. Fresco says that the central hub of the city will house all of the shopping facilities. With that limitation of space, a finite number of businesses can be accommodated. Which ones will be allowed there? How can they grow as they succeed? Cities aren&apos;t closed systems; they need to be flexible.\n\nTwo huge failings of Mr. Fresco&apos;s vision are those of energy demands and of materials. He speaks of aircraft that will operate by electrostatic power (something he explains by the wrong-headed analogy of squeezing a peach pit between your fingers to shoot the pit across the room. Sorry but the air cannot produce pressure against two opposite sides of an aircraft to squeeze it along). The fact is that, barring many magnitude-orders of technological advancement, &quot;electrostatically-powered aircraft&quot; are about as sensible as nuclear-powered autogyros. He touts a variation of the trusty &quot;futuristic monorail&quot;, not acknowledging that monorail beamways are FAR more expensive and difficult to build and repair than traditional railway lines, and are extremely inflexible for growth or change.\n\nLikewise, he never mentions what &quot;futuristic&quot; material his ambitious building projects will use. To make a large building shaped like a potato chip requires a material that can be formed in complex curves. What to use? Fiber-reinforced resin? The Futuro houses of the &apos;60s used that; they&apos;re a nightmare of maintenance and repair (or disposal). Ditto concrete sprayed over forms. And integrating doors and windows into complex-curved structures is problematic (ask anyone who has built a geodesic dome). Metal alloys are hugely expensive. The amount of aluminum required to build a million new homes would increase the unit cost many times, and there&apos;s not enough aluminum ore on the planet to build 100 million such homes.\n\nHis &quot;car of the future&quot;, with its &quot;self-repairing body&quot;, covered with photovoltaic skin and equipped with radar and computer to prevent collisions, is a nightmare of complexity, materials and energy cost, and repair and disposal challenges. All of that technology just so drivers can pay less attention to driving? One could learn something from proponents of &quot;appropriate technology&quot; who might instead suggest building bicycles enveloped in bamboo and fabric streamlining. Of course, they&apos;re not &quot;futuristic&quot; looking, but in their favor, they can be built at home by most reasonably handy people out of cheap materials that can easily be repaired and recycled.\n\nIt&apos;s not enough to come up with an appealing form that looks sleek and desirable; a designer must also understand materials and their limitations. Does Mr. Fresco? If so, he never touches on it; he just trots out one epically ambitious structure or vehicle after another, as if the shape will overcome the challenges of materials, construction, economy, repair or disposal.\n\nOne thing I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Fresco about is an hour into the film where he very cogently explains why humans create superstitions, and how they hold us back. Bravo to him for that, and for challenging our species to do better than we have thus far. But all of the ambition in the world, unless coupled with a good understanding of what it takes to make dreams reality, is little more than window-dressing. Mr. Fresco dresses a window beautifully, but brings us no closer to the future. Still, the film is highly recommended for retro-futurists and dreamers. And in an ideal world, he would have every resource needed to build those dreams.",

      "reviewBody": "THE ARRIVAL OF WANG is a little-known, low-budget Italian sci-fi movie about a female translator, fluent in Mandarin, who finds herself undertaking the most unusual job of her career when contacted by a mysterious government branch. It starts off promisingly, provoking a sense of mystery and foreboding with its &apos;dark room&apos; premise, but sadly it gets more and more ridiculous as the story progresses.\n\nThe main problem I had with the production is its reliance on CGI effects which look fairly ridiculous. A key twist early on had me bursting into laughter rather than being frightened as the female lead was. This transforms it into nothing more than an extended episode of THE OUTER LIMITS (circa 1990s), one which feels dragged out in places. Little happens, and when it&apos;s all over you wonder how they managed to fill the running time out.\n\nThere are some decent scenes and elements here, including a torture sequence or two which prove to be fairly hard-hitting, but I did find the story falling apart as the finishing line approached. The twist ending is anything but surprising, while the acting is little to write home about. It is a shame, because I believe with tighter realism and more focus on the human aspects of the tale this could have been great rather than average.",

      "reviewBody": "Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev&apos;s reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director&apos;s cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.\n\nFortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind&apos;s stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.\n\nThe ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia&apos;s greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky&apos;s imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.\n\nThe movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia&apos;s unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev&apos;s own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.\n\nIt is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don&apos;t know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.\n\nIt is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce&apos;s Finnegan&apos;s Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky&apos;s own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.\n\nTarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a 1981 Australian post-apocalyptic action film directed by George Miller. The film is the second installment in the Mad Max film series, with Mel Gibson starring as Max Rockatansky.\n\nI grew up with the Mad Max films and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Is my personal favorite best epic Post-Apocalyptic Action Classic Science Fiction film. I always loved The Road Warrior to death this film stayed in my heart. Fury Road and The Road Warrior are Equal for me so I am ranting them 10 and I always tried to take the first film of the Max series as the best one in the franchise but I couldn&apos;t, because it is just too dark is not post apocalyptic film enough, it has Drama between the film and the plot starts slow which becomes really boring. The Road Warrior is the opposite of Mad Max which just stayed in my heart and I just love this movie to death and I always will. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior&apos;s thrills.\n\nMel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max&apos;s slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There&apos;s not a moment in the film when we aren&apos;t rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang.The Humungus and Wez for me were the best villains ever in the film. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film&apos;s few humorous moments. And also he has a lot of scenes and a lot of things to do in this film. Like flying that flayer helping Max saving him, fighting against Humungus thugs. Emil Minty as The Feral Kid is awesome. The old man as the narrator from the beginning of the film is The Feral Kid, I love the relationship between him and Max. That&apos;s what I love in this film the acting is TERRIFIC from the actors. Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman is beautiful and fantastic in this movie. I seriously loved how she acted towards Max that he isn&apos;t trust worthy, he needed to win her trust. I love Max&apos;s dog he was so better than in the first movie the other dog was. You could even see a personality in this dog. \n\nI love this movie to death and will always be in my heart Forever. For me Mel Gibson is the only Mad Max Rockatansky!\n\nGrade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 Awesome Post/Apocalyptic/Action Classic/Science Fiction film.",

So they put cheap funny flics like this one together. There are Nazis, Extraterrestrials, Cyborgs, a Spanish gold treasure and of course there¬¥s Franco Nero as the always drunk Soldier of Fortune, who has to pull it all off. As you can see, they didn¬¥t let anything out. And, I think, it works. The FX are cheap but enjoyable, the pacing is fast (it has to be regarding the really dumb plot) and the acting is quite reliable (of course Franco Nero is great as ever and there¬¥s also Hollywood veteran George Kennedy as a Nazi Villain). Director Nello Rossati did the also very enjoyable sequel Django Strikes Again before. A Movie you might check out, too.",

He is not helped by Hessler&apos;s direction, the strengths showed in the earlier `Scream And Scream Again&apos; seem to have disappeared, and replaced by sheer shoddiness (some of the murders are very badly staged).  A more imaginative director was needed to compensate for the script, especially in the case of the repetitive dream sequences which pepper the film.\n\nBy this time Vincent Price had jumped ship and was replaced by Jason Robards Jnr.  An odd choice, as aside from being too contemporary for this period setting, he is also, dare I say it, too good an actor for this material.  It really needed an actor, who like Price, had a strong sense of irony.  As a result Robards just looks flat.  Lom comes across much better, but again ham-fisted direction by Hessler sometimes makes him look absurd (the worst offender is when Lom follows Robards; it&apos;s staged so badly that a blind man would have noticed Lom).\n\nIt&apos;s a mess, but despite its many faults it is entertaining enough, the frustrating thing about it is that you get the feeling that given a better script and a more imaginative director (and Vincent Price instead of Robards) this movie could have been very good indeed."

      "reviewBody": "The year is 1997, and World Peace seems to have come, with most classic weapons of mass destruction having been abandoned. However, orbiting the Earth there is the European/American space station FLORIDA ARKLAB, capable of controlling the weather at any location on the planet underneath. A civil project by nature, it might be abused as an offensive weapon, since it could deliver devastation to any potential adversary simply by creating natural disasters such as storms and floods. No wonder the space station soon becomes the central point in rising political tensions between East and West, next stop World War 3 (as indicated by the German tagline (transl.) &quot;The end of our future has already begun&quot;). We&apos;re following the main protagonist Billy Hayes, an astronaut aboard the station, as he wades through a plot of secrecy and sabotage trying to tell friend from foe in the process.\n\n This film is the first &quot;real&quot; movie by Roland Emmerich, and knowing his later works, it is, simply speaking, surprisingly good. First off, it was and is a visual treat by any standard, with well-crafted models and a set-design that made a point in trying to look as realistic as possible. At that, it is visually reminiscent of many other movies from that era (Star Wars or Moonraker, to name some), but doesn&apos;t fail nearly as badly as some of them do; it simply looks good. And what&apos;s more, this movie has a story that makes some sense and won&apos;t let you leave your seat until it is resolved. The acting is good, the characters are well drawn and partly are in for some surprise. The general mood is by no means optimistic, this is definitely a Cold War scenario, which nowadays of course has the tendency to make you chuckle, considering that 1997 looked totally different than portrayed in the movie.\n\nBottom line: if you know later Emmerich blockbusters such as ID4 and Godzilla, you definitely notice his handwriting in this one, and seeing the path he took from here on makes sense. But much unlike said later works, this movie excells not only in the audio and CGI department, but also has something like characters and storyline. People liked ID4 as a cineastic lollipop, but as a film, this one is far better than most",

This is by far one of the best films I have seen so far this year. 8/10\n\ncriminally underrated"

Rather lovely, most of them except for the annoying fade to black at the end of each and every one. To appreciate this, or rather to not be offended, I suppose you have to accept that the female form is appealing, and accept that a young girl can initiate an affair with an older man.\n\nBesides the appeal of the balletgirls and the way they are displayed, there&apos;s the story.\n\nIt isn&apos;t much of one, surely insufficient for most commentors, and the fact that it is so slight seems to rile them a bit, as indication that the nudity was all that mattered.\n\nBut the elements of the story that do exist are what I call &quot;folding.&quot; Usually the purpose of folding is to place the viewer in the movie, and that&apos;s the case here.\n\nWe have an artist in the writer/director who represents young girls in the nude. He and we have a surrogate on-screen, in a character who is an artist (a sculptor) and represents young girls in the nude. The titular Laura is a dancer, inviting viewers.\n\nSo far, the fold is ordinary. By the thinnest of plot devices, our sculptor goes blind after starting a sculpture of Laura. So she offers to be the model, allowing him to caress her on every part, sufficiently to make a clay copy, which he similarly caresses. She, meanwhile has a crush on him and seduces him during this process.\n\nSee the fold? We not only get to look but touch, and that touch is returned.\n\nNo, ma&apos;am that&apos;s not a slight story. No, not at all.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "reviewBody": "Well, whaddaya know, the &quot;MiB&quot; have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been hogging the cinemas while the &quot;Men In Black&quot; go missing-in-action. No matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.\n\nAnd with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US$215-million production, it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.\n\nWill Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The &apos;odd-couple&apos; have their work cut out for them when extra-terrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K&apos;s existence, it&apos;s up to him to venture through time, look for a young K (now played by Josh Brolin) and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.\n\nI have never been a fan of time-travel plots and I still don&apos;t like them. However, the time-travel subplot here is just to provide the &quot;Back To The Future&quot; fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative, as well as the mood and tone of the movie, are light-hearted, fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again, it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones&apos; can generate so much mirth. The Smith &amp; Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.\n\nOne of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3, we have a &apos;twist&apos; that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still, the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker&apos;s creature designs and make-up rendered in 3D. The &apos;monster show&apos; does not disappoint, especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes, there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hoover-bikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole, Agents J and K still provide the &apos;L&apos;. - limchangmoh.blogspot.com",

It&apos;s fairly standard but enjoyable enough with plenty of action to keep an average peplum fan happy. The fighting in particular is good with Ursus flinging and clobbering the thugs with abandonment. Trial that Ursus has to do prove his innocence is quite good, especially the bit where the elephant is pulling him to the arrow points sticking out of the wood. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was Ursus&apos; kid brother as he was annoying and nosey.",

      "reviewBody": "I never saw this movie in the theaters (it seemed like another Leo-mania &quot;no REAL talent&quot; type of film), but I remember a friend recommending it to me one night about 5 years back.  Since I love sword fighting movies/3 musketeer flicks, I just had to give it a try. Plus, I had seen the previews, and they looked interesting.  Well, let me tell you...from the opening scene to the ending credits, I was hooked with this film!  It grabbed my attention, and was just pure fun!! I don&apos;t know why this movie got such a low rating on IMDB.  It may not be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but it&apos;s surely a great, fun, entertaining film!\n\nFirst of all, the cast is great.  I mean, have you seen so many good actors in one film?? Byrnes, Depardieu, Malcovich, DiCaprio, and Irons.  All such a WONDERFUL cast, with good acting.  I liked Leo&apos;s duel roles too.  At first I thought it would be cheesy, but Leo delivered it well!  He played both roles of Louis (bad king) and Phillipe (good king) so diversely!  I liked how he had you loving one king, and totally despising the other!  Someone also mentioned the way Leo totally changed characters with his &quot;eyes&quot;.  THe &quot;EYES&quot; say a lot, and Leo nailed it.  I almost had to ask myself if this was the SAME actor playing Phillipe!\n\nThe plot was good (eh...might have been predictable, but still...great), the cinematagraphy was awesome, the music was moving, the sword fighting/action was cool! I absolutely loved Gabriel Byrnes in this movie.  He was so great as D&apos;Artagnan (sp?).  John Malcovich was perfect for his role of Athos too. I really felt his pain.  I have both the VHS (older) and the DVD version (hey, it was on sale for 9 bucks!! lol) of The Man In The Iron Mask, and the DVD version (although not a whole lot of extras) has a nice directors commentary.  It really tells the director&apos;s vision for the film and all the behind the scene info.  I STILL can&apos;t believe that this movie was his FIRST film!!\n\nVery entertaining movie.  I really don&apos;t know why people dogged this movie so much.  It was SOOOO much better than that &quot;OTHER&quot; more RECENT musketeer movie that came out called &quot;THE Musketeer&quot;.  UGghgh...what a dissapointment!\n\n But The Man In The Iron MASK is DEFINITELY a movie worth giving a try."

The plot, about a nurse in the terminally ill department goes to seek her childhood friend, is not enough to keep attention. Besides, neither the main character, nor any of the side characters seem to have anything appealing to keep the viewer amused. All we see is gray buildings, unfriendly and non attached people; for one hour this is still okay, but given the length of this movie it is simply too long. I have watched this movie on DVD and had to take a break more than once, just because of boredom. Technically speaking, there were no serious flaws in the plot, but its appeal was simply not enough. If you have any choice, there are much better movies made in Hungary than this!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie appears to have many names. Vychislitel is the original Russian name but in English it appears to be called Calculator, in French Titanium and in German Titanium ‚Äì Strafplanet XT-59. The English title is, as far as I understand it, the one closest to the original Russian name.\n\nI have to confess that I had some problems following this movie since the original language is, of course, Russian and my Russian is a wee bit rusty as in non-existent. Therefore we had to watch it dubbed which is something I normally never do. Unfortunately the French are lousy (arrogant) when it comes to foreign movies and even on a Blu-ray disc they can generally only be bothered to include a French sound track if the original movie is not English. Thus we had to watch it in French and my French is not really good enough to understand all the nuances.\n\nAnyway this is a fairly decent little science fiction movie. Not a great one but definitely decent. The story is perhaps not the most innovative around. On a planet rather hostile to human life with a totalitarian government controlling the inhabitant&apos;s lives in minute detail, including who they marry etc¬Ö a group of condemned prisoners are let loose on the planets surface where they are expected to die. Naturally some of them do not but manages to undertake a journey which brings them to a secret hideout with the means to escape. The movie tells the story about their journey.\n\nThe reason we bought this movie was because me and my oldest son saw the trailer on TV (I know, you should never buy a movie based on the trailer) and it looked quite cool with some original special effects. There are indeed some cool looking special effects in this movie. The black and hostile landscape are quite cool and it is filled with some rather original life forms. All of them very hostile towards anything biological that moves of course.\n\nUnfortunately the movie did not appear to be made on a very high budget. The monsters and the scenery are quite cool as I wrote but a lot of the movie is spent on people walking, people talking or people arguing. A lot of the cool stuff was shown in the trailer though. Having said that, the scenery and the acting was still quite decent although, as I also said, I did struggle a bit to follow all of the interactions.\n\nAs a whole it was an interesting movie if you are a science fiction fan but people looking for a special effects and action loaded movie will probably be disappointed. I did not feel like a waste of time for me (I am a science fiction fan after all) but it was not a &quot;wow this movie was good&quot; moment either.",

They looked good even if they weren&apos;t called upon to act. What is the point in Hollywood making films like this with a budget so small that the movie appeared to have been made in one afternoon. Indeed frequent shots of the submarine showed the same seagulls unmoved! If Burroughs weren&apos;t already dead I think seeing this film might have killed him anyway.

Two other women have love troubles as well--one has a fiance whose father won&apos;t hear of his marrying a chorus dancer, the other has turned her back on the gorgeous Marcello Mastroianni (also at the beginning of his career--his name is even misspelled in the credits!) to marry a millionaire gargoyle and is having regrets.\n\nOddly, though Gina and Marcello went on to stardom, the one who seems like the best bet for it is Tamara Lees, as the gold-digger, who is far better looking than Gina, indeed very similar to the ravishing Gene Tierney, counterpointed with a quiet intensity. Go figure!\n\nYou can see this movie on the website rarefilmm (note the two m&apos;s).",

      "reviewBody": "Du skal √¶re din hustru was restored last year by Palladium, the original company that released it in 1925. It was also released on DVD along with the likewise newly restored Vredens Dag, Ordet and Gertrud. These are actually the first ever releases on DVD by the Danes themselves of their most important films. It took some time but the result is splendid, at least as far as Du skal √¶re din hustru is concerned. The current version is free from scratches and dirt and comes with the original Danish intertitles. It runs for 107 minutes.\n\nHaving seen the other early Dreyer films (before Jeanne) both long ago on the screen and on DVD relatively recent, I must say that this remains for me without doubt the most interesting one. Indeed it is great! This is because its success is purely cinematographic: Although based on the popular 1919 play &quot;The tyrant&apos;s fall&quot;, it strikes me how little it resembles a stage performance; how well the natural acting (not in any way overacted) is integrated in the two or three small rooms of the troubled family&apos;s apartment, not least how excellently the scenes are constructed, and especially the lightning, which is never too bright, yet bringing out every detail in the house. It is a joy to see this environment come alive; a cross between a petit bourgeois and an upper working class world, as well as to study the many objects appearing from another time: The carefully hung pictures on the walls, the always-burning oven (it is winter) with its place for the kettle, and all the small oddities from a hundred years ago (well, almost). Indeed Dreyer himself paid utmost importance to it; he constructed everything from scratch to look exactly like a Christianshavn apartment, and he made sure that the camera always was positioned around the characters like it was another ghostly member of the family. We are drawn into the surroundings in a way that a theatre stage never could manage, and the actors are shown in their best possible manner, where only a small wink or a troubled gaze is enough to indicate what goes on inside them and how they interact with one another. This is a huge step forward from the previous films by Dreyer, and indeed from most other films at the time. \n\nAs the plot is well cared for by other posters, I will not bother here with any details but must say that I find the relationship between husband and wife to be as realistic as could be hoped for in a 1925 movie: Viktor may be a tyrant but only a household tyrant (they can be bad enough). He is cross, not violent. And Ida may be the typical suffering and under-appreciated wife but she bares her lot with great dignity. She loves him and supports him because she understands that his loss of business gives him hard times; he can barely support his family, yet he must appear like a winner to the outside world. The children seem to understand this as well, particularly the sympathetic and obedient Karen but also her younger brother Frederik, who must nevertheless endure some humiliating punishment. They seem to know every possible little detail that Viktor craves, and they try not to makes things worse for him. That leaves the rebel of the house, Viktor&apos;s old nanny, who provides both comical relief and some clever revenge structures. They all tell so much by playing so little, it is as if the story could be told almost by their gestures alone, without the need of the abundance of intertitles which to me are only stating the obvious. We can see what&apos;s going on; every frame tells a story and every cut makes us notice how swiftly the action can change from the tense to the out of hand. Dreyer is really himself the master of the house as far as editing is concerned, often creating fast moving scenes by making movement continue from one shot to another in a masterful way that was not common at that time. Today it easy to overlook such important details and consequently loose much of what makes this film special. \n\nWhen first released, the film was an outstanding success, both with the critics and with the audiences, both in Denmark and abroad, most notably in France, where Le Temps saw its simplicity and attention to small details as a great example to be followed by French directors. In 1925, that included at least Jean Renoir, whose first films were not free from stagey drama and overacting (Nana...). The official Carl Th. Dreyer website provides both this review and others, although you need to brush up your Danish to read them (Well if James Joyce could do it...): It seems that the Danish critics all agreed that this was the best Danish film yet. The site also provides the full manuscript with many scenes missing from the current print. I think I remember seeing a beautiful scene where Karen, full of sisterly love, washes the nude Frederik, who is standing in a basin in the kitchen, but it is now missing. It is, however, shown on a still photo that is both on the DVD and on the Dreyer-site. Was it censored? Or is it just my dirty imagination? There are also some hilarious fantasy scenes in the manuscript, including one where Viktor is horsewhipping the entire family who are pulling him around on a wagon, that were either not filmed or cut somewhere along the way.\n\nAnyway, the film as we have it in the current print remains one of the most moving of its era, as good as the similar ones by Murnau and Pabst from around the same time (say Tartuffe and Geheimnisse einer Seele), and that for me is as good as domestic cinema ever got in the twenties.",

      "reviewBody": "Title: FW Murnaus Faust (1926) \n\nDirector: FW Murnau \n\nCast: Gosta Ekman, Camilla Horn, Emil Jannings, William Dieterle Review: \n\nHaving seen Murnaus Nosferatu and having enjoyed it immensely I had to check out some of his other films. Faust quickly caught my attention. After Murnau made Nosferatu, he was given the opportunity to do whatever film he wanted..and they gave him the huge budget to do it. The result was an impressive, visually stunning, supernatural film.\n\nGod and the Devil are fighting for who gets to control humanity. They do a wager, they decide that if Satan (aka as Mephisto) can corrupt Faust then all of humanity would belong to Mephisto. After the wager is on, Mephisto spreads the plague throughout Fausts town and people start dying. He decides to call upon the powers of darkness to help people out.\n\nFirst off, more then anything, this movie is a true visual feast. How Murnau made this movie with the limited resources he had at the time is a true testament to his talent as a filmmaker. Heck, it was 1926, before make up fx, before stan winston, before blue screens and CGI, before anything! Yet, he managed to create an incredibly rich film. Heck this guy even managed to do a crane shot in the movie! In a scene where Faust and Mephisto are flying through the sky&apos;s...the camera swoops over a landscape filled with waterfalls, mountains and cliffs...all in one shot! I was actually amazed how with their limited technological resources Murnau managed to do this type of shot back in those days.\n\nThe imagery is amazing...starting with Mephisto spreading his gigantic black wings over Fausts small town. I kid you not when I say that, that image is one of the coolest images I have ever seen on any movie. Images of the horsemen of the apocalypse riding the sky&apos;s....angels with swords, Faust conjuring up Mephisto by reading from his book...man this movie was really something to behold. Its all wrapped around that black and white aura that gives the film that eerie feel. Kinda like the same feeling I got when I watched White Zombie. I love black and white horror visuals. And Faust was full of them.\n\nOf special interest to me was that scene where Faust conjures up Mephisto by reading some words from a book, its truly a great movie moment with an incredible supernatural feel. The visuals of those circles of light emanating from the ground up towards the sky...that was amazing. And actually I think that scene influenced Francis Ford Copolla in Bram Stokers Dracula because he uses the exact same image of circles of light emerging from the ground.\n\nFaust fantastical imagery truly demonstrates that Murnau had complete and total control over everything that he showed on the screen. The snow, the wind, the shadows, the lights...all perfectly handled to create the exact mood and feel that was required at them moment. Its quite obvious as well that this movies benefited from a much much bigger budget then Murnaus previous films. The sets look a lot like those on Caligari at times, the detailed miniatures are very well achieved and the extras are plentiful.\n\nThe performances are great, better then in Nosferatu. They are sometimes a bit exaggerated, but not as much as in other silent films I&apos;ve seen before. On this one, the performances seemed just right to me. Of special mention is Emil Jannings as Mephisto. This guy played Beelzebub with some real relish. The character comes off as evil, treacherous, calculating...and he does it all with this smirk on his face. Great character. The make up on him is great and he kinda reminded me at times of Bela Lugosi as Dracula. But overall, hes performance was the best in the film. I also really enjoyed Camilla Horn as Gretchen, her scenes with her baby in the snow were great not only in the acting department but visually as well.\n\nOverall, Id recommend this movie to those of you interested in German silent cinema. Its really something to see how even in those days, the imagination and creativity was there. And even the limited technological resources couldn&apos;t hold them back from creating a truly beautiful, haunting, spooky, supernatural film. For those of you who enjoyed films like Murnaus Nosferatu or Robert Wienes The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari then you will most certainly love Faust.\n\nI would certainly say it is far superior to the films mentioned before, yet for some reason doesn&apos;t get as much recognition. Check it out schmoes for a slice of the best horror silent cinema ever. Definitely worth a look.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Age of Innocence&apos; is a rather atypical film, at least from the point of view of the social environment in which the story takes place, for Martin Scorsese&apos;s filmography. Made in 1993, it stands chronologically in his career between the horror thriller &apos;Cape Fear&apos; and the mafia-controlled investigation of the gambling industry world in &apos;Casino&apos;. Most of the action takes place in New York, the city where Scorsese was born and which provides the stage for many of his films. But the era is in the eighth decade of the 19th century, and the characters belong to the super-rich American world, people who, after accumulating colossal fortunes, aspired to a social status that would compete with the European big bourgeoisie and even with the nobility across the ocean. It is the story of a romantic triangle bound by social conventions, with heroes who act largely according to the patterns dictated by the manners and morals of the time. We are apparently a long way from the world of crime and the physical violence of many of Scorsese&apos;s other films. And yet, this social environment can prove, in many ways, just as cruel and ruthless towards those who try to break its rules.\n\nThe story takes place in New York in the 1870&apos;s, where the young lawyer Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to May Welland (Winona Ryder). Both are born in families that belong to the high society of the city. May&apos;s cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), is newly returned to New York after a disastrous marriage to a financially ruined Polish count. At first she is ostracized by society and vicious rumors spread about her, but as May&apos;s family boldly supports the countess, she begins to be accepted into the city&apos;s rich and respected circles. Newland becomes her lawyer, but gradually falls in love with the woman who lived in Europe, is sophisticated and free in conceptions and tastes. This relationship jeopardizes Newland&apos;s future marriage to May. The question is if and where can the characters find happiness. In the fulfillment of true love or in the stability of the family, according to the accepted social norms?\n\nThe film is a screen adaptation (which is said to be fairly accurate, but I have not read the book) of a novel by American writer Edith Wharton. It reminded me of the novels of her contemporary, the English writer John Galsworthy, which inspired a famous BBC television series: the same manners and social conventions that stifle genuine feelings, the same moral and social dilemmas. To connect with the book, Martin Scorsese uses copious off-screen voice comments (read by Joanne Woodward). I usually hate encountering this technique in cinematography, which in my opinion is mostly a visual art, but here it fits well. The narration flows smoothly and interestingly, but in order to appreciate it, the spectator must like the nuances in the words of the characters and should be interested in the epoch and the historical details. Martin Scorsese is at his best at reassembling the mansions, filming clothing, dishes, art objects, porcelain, and cutlery used by the people who fill these buildings, recreating the atmosphere of a growing and ever-changing city. Acting is wonderful. Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer give two of the most significant performances of their careers, managing to create the atmosphere of a passionate affair that never goes physically beyond a kiss or a handshake and is expressed in words but especially in looks. The whole team of actors, in fact, is exceptional, and the quality of the film results from the visual part (extremely mobile camera) but also from the gestures of each character. &apos;The Age of Innocence&apos; is a film that rightly earns the status of a cinematic classic, and that will last for a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "I read that this film has been labeled by parents as a &quot;Disney Bomb&quot; because it&apos;s too scary for their young children. Parents who take kids to see any movie need to be aware of something: if it&apos;s rated PG there are likely going to be scenes that your six year old will not enjoy -- even if the name Disney is attached to it. The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney&apos;s own Mickey&apos;s Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The plot should be familiar to just about anyone who has been alive sometime during the past 150 years, and the fact that there are spirits (ghosts) in the story should also be a red flag to parents. Especially since two of them are downright frightening in just about any version of the story.\n\nThe truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The dialogue is taken nearly word-for-word from the book, and the look and feel of the film brilliantly capture what you would imagine wintertime in London in the 19th century to be like. A few of the special effects are a bit over-the-top, but most work well and add enough pizazz for cynical modern-day audiences. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone.\n\nOnce every few months I&apos;m dragged kicking and screaming to see a new film. I can&apos;t stand wasting my hard-earned dollar on the crap Hollywood throws at us these days, but every once in a while I&apos;m pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoy a movie. This was definitely one of those rare times.",

The ones who have lost someone to onforeseen events will know the tearing feeling of wanting to speak to the deceased person for just one more time. In Another end, this wish becomes reality for Sal, who has lost his wife Zoe in a car accident. With the help of a technology that takes Zoe&apos;s memories and thoughts and plants them into a host, he gets to speak to his love again.\n\nPiero Messina has created a touching drama, that masterly depicts the different feelings of loss: the longing, the pain, the unanswered questions, the words unspoken, the wish to just die - all in contrast to the happiness created by the person&apos;s memories. The outstanding performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Renate Reinsve, combined with the touching music (by Moderat among others) and excellent camera work create an atmosphere, that stayed with me long after the movie was over. At times the movie reminded me of Inception, one of my favourite movies. I saw the movie at the world premiere at Berlinale and read a few reviews by critics that stated the movie was just a copy. But it is not a copy at all! It is even better and hits completely different which might not be understood by people who have not gone through the same loss before. For the ones of you who are not as lucky I can only recommend this movie to you on your journey to closure. 10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a very cute story that while done on a tight budget kept my attention focused on what transpired. The acting was incredible when kept in mind that it was such a young main cast with the exception of the older well-knowns that came in to take on some of the other opposing heavy roles. I really like Ronny Cox and was glad to see him as a good guy in this even though he can portray a villain like none-other when called for. I also like Harris Yulin a lot so it was always a pleasure to see him as well. Colin Farrell seemed to actually live this role which is why he was perfect for it. I&apos;d have to say that his acting talent has sagged to a lower level in his recent choices though. Maybe he became lazier or doesn&apos;t feel the need to try as hard anymore...who knows!? The action scenes were believable even if they were by no means near an epic-sized proportion. Ali Larter is pretty hot and is a decent actress! I&apos;m really surprised she isn&apos;t in a lot more films because she definitely has my vote! She&apos;s realistic and is able to keep forming varying reactions to the different situations she encounters. Overall a much better movie than I thought and am glad I finally got a chance to enjoy it.\n\nFinal Trail:\n\nMovies: Not worth the high ticket prices.\n\nDVD Purchase: No, only for the reason that I&apos;d only watch it a couple more times in this life.\n\nRental: Makes for a great adventure night!",

It is absolutely the best presentation of the politics of man and our inability to ever resolve the major issues of our existence.  Peter Weiss has fully captured the unending struggle between the politics necessary to obtain freedom versus that which enslaves.  The best parts are the discussions between Sade and Marat as to the results of freedom versus dictatorship and capitalism versus socialism.  The entire story provides a voyage through the human comedy and shows the inability of humanity to ever figure out the real truth of our existence and relationship to each other and our socitey. The result is a better understanding of the sinusoidal flow of the give an take of our history.",

      "reviewBody": "What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there&apos;s an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can&apos;t achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?\n\nA great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher ¬ñ but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20&apos;s without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we&apos;ve since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.\n\nWhat truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980&apos;s, grew up in the 1990&apos;s, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980&apos;s technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.\n\nAbove all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor ¬ñ a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers&apos; talents. I&apos;m eagerly waiting for other outings by these young folks.",

      "name": "Affleck&apos;s second matches realism of the first and the fine ensemble carries the rest",
      "reviewBody": "Ben Affleck&apos;s second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he&apos;s no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; succeeds, so does &quot;The Town.&quot; Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on &quot;The Town,&quot; however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.\n\nIt starts with the cast and the performances he gets from them. In 2007, he helped Amy Ryan to a supporting actress nomination, and that&apos;s ignoring the other talents in the film such as Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris. In &quot;The Town,&quot; he gets Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner in his first major film since his breakout in &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; and Jon Hamm in his first major film since TV&apos;s &quot;Mad Men&quot; took off. He also gets a pair of up-and-comers in Rebecca Hall and &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; star Blake Lively. And that&apos;s not to mention Pete Postelthwaite and Chris Cooper. Next to &quot;Inception,&quot; it&apos;s the best ensemble cast of the year.\n\nBased on the Chuck Hogan novel &quot;Prince of Thieves,&quot; the film follows a team of bank robbers from Charlestown, an area notorious for grooming the best at intercepting armored cars and taking down banks. As with &quot;Gone Baby Gone,&quot; also based on a novel (by Dennis Lehane), the city of Boston and the people and culture are as important to Affleck as the plot. He&apos;s sure to let shots of the Charlestown bridge and Fenway Park soak in amidst the ever-building pinch the main characters are in.\n\nDoug MacRay (Affleck) and his buddy Jim (Renner) and a couple others pull off a bank job in the opening scene, but when it doesn&apos;t go exactly as planned, they&apos;re forced to kidnap the bank manager (Hall). To make sure she didn&apos;t see anything and can hand them on a platter to the feds (led by Jon Hamm&apos;s Special Agent Frawley), Doug trails her, only to find himself falling for her.\n\n&quot;The Town&quot; is one of those crime dramas/bank-job action films that while not revelatory for the genre, executes everything well and sticks to a character-driven story in order to stay meaningful. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it floats in between the drama, never becoming too much of a guns &apos;n robbers flick, but also not slipping into crime melodrama for too long. Affleck&apos;s performance as MacRay acts in accordance; it&apos;s tastefully understated and he lets go of the machismo that has marred a few of his previous roles.\n\nThe film also has an unexpected but much appreciated sense of humor. In a mile-a-minute crime drama/thriller, you don&apos;t expect to laugh the way you will in &quot;The Town,&quot; which speaks even more to the writing and Affleck&apos;s versatility. Even if there are some plot conventions and no-surprise characters (as good as Hamm is, he&apos;s playing every other quick-witted FBI guy in films), the dialogue is sharp, the story is exciting and the way we are so easily able to see things from MacRay&apos;s perspective as the bank robber who wants out makes up for any use of convention as a crutch.\n\nThere&apos;s no doubt that if &quot;The Town&quot; becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high-profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors, he&apos;ll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

The special effects weren&apos;t really all that effective. The story just didn&apos;t have any cohesion and as such never gain ed any momentum to draw the viewer in.

      "reviewBody": "After the disappointing effort of the first Scooby-Doo film I wasn&apos;t much enthusiastic about this &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot;. But to tell the truth this film handled the characters better and the climax more interesting, at least in terms of the identity of the villain. It remained true to the original cartoon storyline in the sense that the character of the villain appeared earlier in the film. The dialogues also got better, though abandoning thick sense of humor was impossible. It failed to develop enough chemistry between the members of the gang, which is in fact faithful to the cartoon where in my opinion the characters are quite one-dimensional.\n\nThe CGI of Scooby himself has improved only slightly. The monsters could have been designed better, although there are touches of nice imagination e.g. the candy floss monster. The most irritating parts were unnecessary hip-hop dance sequences. Besides such points, Scooby Doo 2 deserves more praise than its prequel.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Butter&quot; penned by upcoming writer Jason Micallef has plenty of flavor. The story is fun and uncomplicated. Yes, there are not-so thinly veiled political undertones that enrich the film, this is an easy watching fun film. I thought Micallef did a fine job balancing the very real world of butter sculpting competitions from the Great Plains states and the absurdity of this unreal black comedy. \n\nOlivia Wilde is a tour d&apos; force in this film. She plays the drifting, sexy Delilah with control and command. No doubt she steals her scenes or is allowed to steal the scenes from the rest of this straight laced line up of characters. \n\nNot to be out done, Jennifer Garner offers a fresh and unpredictable performance. We have grown to love the often tender Garner, it was fun to hate her this time. \n\nTy Burell gives us more of what we love him for. Mr. Kicked in the Groin, has never been more masterfully perfected than by Burell. \n\nIf I could I would buy stock in Yara Shahidi. This young actress will win your heart and have you rooting for her from her first scene. Shahidi is surrounded by a strong cast but she finds her own light and performs above the fray. \n\nThe art direction, photography, costumes and other creative rolls are completed well within the expectations of well funded Hollywood backed indie film. \n\nThe Weinstein Co with their RADiUS distribution are are again testing the VOD prior to theatrical distribution model. Only time will tell how this will work out but Itunes users are popping for the $9.99 rental. I think the multi-platform distribution model will be perfected and small projects will benefit in the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps isn&apos;t the sharp, critical film that its makers want you to think of it as. The sequel to the supremely influential, endlessly quotable original from the 80&apos;s is a dull whimper about what triggered the present financial meltdown and though it&apos;s cut from the same cloth as the original, it possess all of the bark yet, sadly, none of the bite.\n\nGordon Gekko is a name that defined an era. Played by Michael Douglas twenty three years ago, he reverberated in the minds of viewers as a ruthless, amoral investor without a soul. Years later, the sequel finds him released after serving his prison sentence. Cut to seven years after his release, and its 2008, the dawn of the financial crisis. Gekko is now known as a speaker publicly vilifying the notion of greed in corporate America while simultaneously, and some would reckon quite ironically, publicizing his book inspiringly titled &quot;Is Greed Good&quot;. A loner who travels in subways, he is estranged from his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan, androgynously unglamorous) who is engaged to a young trader named Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). Jake bumps into Gekko at one of his speeches (the films finest scene) and the two form a mentor-prot√©g√© relationship that irks Winnie but allows Jake to benefit by plotting revenge from Bretton James (Josh Brolin, the films principle villain), suspected of being responsible for the suicide of Louis Zabel, a close friend and confidant of Jake.\n\nIf the film sounds like a mess of relationships, then it is. As muddled as Stone&apos;s own political activism it has no clarity on what its trying to say. From trying to rationalize the reasons behind the market crash to the impulsive nature of human behaviour, it doesn&apos;t get either right. Not helping are the actors that Stone assembles. It&apos;s a mystery to me why Shia LaBeouf is constantly being thrust down viewer throats in film after film by studios convinced he is the next best thing. He is not, and despite being dressed up in expensive designer garb, cannot pass off as being anything more convincing than a working intern. His relationship with Gekko has none of the enticing quality that Charlie Sheen&apos;s Bud Fox did and a cameo appearance by Sheen only underscores this disparity. Douglas himself has none of the limelight. He has some powerful lines, but feels largely sidelined by the revenge/relationship/murder subplots and behaves uncharacteristically, especially in the very last scene (these were probably added as an afterthought). After showing some promise of returning to his incendiary, often infuriating filmmaking style and point of view with his previous film W, director Stone seems to have gone back to being comfortable working with drab studio approved material.\n\nNot only was the original Wall Street a tremendously entertaining film, but one that was blessed with the critical foresight of its maker. The sequel partially entertains but does not have a new perspective. It is neither critical nor insightful and could have, with the same script and actors, been the work of a lesser director than Stone. The films themes are also impersonal - none of the characters suffer directly from the financial crisis the way they did in the original, they suffer from their own incompetent decision making, a sharp departure from how the original handled and fused stock trading with personal loss and gain.",

It turns out to be a fun ride.\n\nChristine Brown is a loan officer in L.A. and is trying to get the position of assistant manager. She decides that in order to impress her boss, she has to be tougher. So when an old gypsy woman comes and asks her for a third extension on mortgage payment, Christine denies her that. Feeling shamed, the old woman puts a curse on Christine, and sends a demon after her. Her life is suddenly in ruins, but with the help of a fortune teller, and his Latin American friends, Christine attempts to rid herself of the demon, before it takes her down to hell. \n\nthe ending of the film is more than somewhat controversial, and in fact you could even spend the rest of the day going over it in your mind, trying to figure out what the Raimi bros were thinking. In fact considering what they choose, the entire story is kind of pointlessly staged, but at least it is fun. Raimi takes us on a crazy ride, we the viewers are treated to a handful of shocking and humorous moments, many of which directly resemble, the Evil Dead flicks. You can tell from this that after fifteen years, Raimi is still a master at horror. He has tackled every genre but it is clear now that he is most at home with this genre. I would not say it&apos;s lovable, but it doesn&apos;t disappoint either.",

The fact that it is a &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot; - made in Italy a week after the Spaghetti Western was born - and its a rock n&apos; Roll musical exists tickles me to no end!\n\nThe songs are catchy and memorable...even if you don&apos;t understand what they are saying. I&apos;m shocked this movie didn&apos;t get on the Midnight movie circuit. It has everything Rocky Horror has.. but its not a parody or spoof of the Spaghetti Westerns..as they just started making them a year or two prior. &quot;LIttle Rita of the West&quot; is its own glorious creation.\n\nThere are some scenes where it drags. Mostly one or two in the middle ..and at the very end. There is one moment with Terrence Hills character that brings up a personal story for him..but gets totally dropped not 2 minutes later and never brought back up.. but at that point, you don&apos;t care as it doesn&apos;t effect the main and Rita&apos;s story at all.\n\nWhy people rate this below a 7 out of 10 baffles me.",

We watch him throughout the whole film, wondering, Is he really just that sure of himself, or is he dangerously deranged?  That question will take you through right to the end. Between Rupert, whose basement (in his mother&apos;s house) is decorated like a comedy club, and his oddball chum (S.Bernhard), there&apos;s considerable pathos.  Jerry Lewis gives a lot of insight into the real person behind his easygoing public persona.  \n\nPart of what makes this movie so compelling is Scorsese&apos;s decision to keep the musical score to a minimum.  Music could force the viewer to a conclusion that isn&apos;t entirely accurate.  Listening to Rupert&apos;s endless exchanges Jerry, and everyone who stands in his way -- as is, without musical coloring -- enhances the &quot;squirm factor.&quot;\n\nAnyone who has been in the uncomfortable position of coming to regret being nice to someone will relate to this movie.  It&apos;s a must-see, and despite being more than 20 years old now, it is not a bit dated.\n\n/r",

I especially like the sound of the blaring guitar note that repeats while the five vengeance seekers are tied up and baking in the sun. Closer to the end of the film we are treated to some cool zoom shots and great music as the adversaries face each other in the street. It&apos;s great, dramatic spaghetti style action. The characters look a bit too clean cut for a spaghetti western, but the rest makes up for it.\n\nPeople that like revenge stories will love the part where a slow painful death is gleefully delivered to a rapist as his victim watches. Great stuff!",

      "reviewBody": "Four friends gather for a weekend trip that turns into a nightmare when three of them end up stuck inside of a sauna.\n\nThere&apos;s not much to go on other than that for a synopsis but movies banking on a claustrophobic vibe have tackled even bigger challenges. One only has to think about Buried, featuring Ryan Reynolds all alone and six feet under. A good screenplay featuring rich characters and interesting conflicts could probably have carried 247¬∞F but unfortunately, this wasn&apos;t the case here.\n\n247¬∞F features cookie-cutter protagonists who follow the usual formula but without much savvy and no heart. Of course, you&apos;ve got the prototypical troubled girl as the main character. Her carefree hot female friend. The cynical jock who is the hottie&apos;s insensitive boyfriend and of course, the more down to earth dude who may or may not hook up with our heroin.\n\nGeorgia is a country that more and more international productions are turning to for cost-effective shooting, so I suppose they might as well turn to making their own movies. This one has the look and production values of a typical American straight-to-video. The problem here is the story, the screenplay. The movie begins by highlighting the past of Jenna, a now quiet girl who survived a car accident but lost her boyfriend. 247¬∞F takes place three years later, as a medicated Jenna still struggles to get past that tragedy. Unfortunately, the screenplay and direction never make this gripping.\n\nOne could hope the story would finally take off once the three characters get stuck inside but this is not the case either. There is no character development, not much in the way of interesting conflicts. No smart thinking and not much drama unfolding other than the three of them successively losing their temper or arguing pointlessly. All of this intersecting with a few scenes featuring people on the outside going about their business. Will the three find a way out? Will someone on the outside help them? Those two questions are what 247¬∞F is all about but unfortunately, the screenplay doesn&apos;t build much suspense. The audience is simply left waiting with very little sense of anticipation being built up.\n\nScout Taylor-Compton is adequate as Jenna. The other protagonists are played by standard B-movie actors probably picked because they are nice too look at. The music score is decent. There are no major faults as far as cinematography... but as a whole, this is below average film making with no heart, because such a story demands a much richer screenplay.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that despite this being listed in the horror genre, there is very little here that qualifies the movie as such. (I personally did not mind and I did not lower the rating for that, but think it deserves to be mentioned so that others won&apos;t be disappointed)",

With opening credits that seem to fit a Eurospy feature rather than a Western, music that swings between traditional fair and electric keyboard and absolutely horrid comic relief, this is a film with a tonal and identity crisis. The dubbing is iffy and the sound design leaves out much detail besides characters speaking (well the important ones anyway, there is many a scene where ancillary characters speak with no word to be heard) and the camera work is amateurish and unimaginative. The characters are weak and the plot, though naturally following A to B in that particularly Italian style, is nevertheless unenjoyable. This film also commits two further sins of an egregious nature, utterly wasting the casting of Margaret Lee as she is given practically nothing to do with her brief screen time and then not even having the decency to show her off either for a bit of eye candy to compensate. What a shame, she deserved better.\n\nAs much as I and many others enjoy Spaghetti Westerns, one does have to admit that they can in many cases be dime a dozen and not worth the viewing. For me, Djurado is most definitely one of them.",

      "reviewBody": "1992 was the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus landing on American soil and there were three prominent movies made to cash in on this - 1492, Conquest of Paradise and the film generally regarded as the most historically accurate of the three, Carry On Columbus. They were all crap I think, with the Carry On one being voted the worst British film ever made in 2004 by film professionals. Its not entirely unfair, as it really is a hopeless pile of garbage. It makes Cannon and Ball&apos;s Boys in Blue appear like Police Academy and the other Carry On films appear...better. The script is dreadful and the acting performances dire. It truly is alternative comedy, i.e. An alternative TO comedy. So, hop onboard the good ship Asinine on its voyage to the laughter-free zone.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure if someone has hot as Jennifer Aniston were to offer you to touch their butt, I&apos;m sure almost every male out there would jump at the chance of doing so without thinking twice. It&apos;s a no brainer offer, and a teaser of course to a larger, more sentimental story out there about the relentless pursuit of love, the romanticism attached to wanting to be with someone, without being consciously bogged by the harsh realities of life and survival. With affairs of the heart, to me at least it&apos;s a seizing of opportunities presented, rather than to adopt the wait and see approach.\n\nThe hook for the film, written and directed by Stephen Belber, is of course that much talked about scene between Aniston and Steve Zahn, the former being Sue, an art saleswoman who on a business trip had stayed at a motel, which Zahn&apos;s Mike is the night manager of his family&apos;s business. Smitten by none other than her buttocks, Mike crafts simple yet really strange excuses just to be close to Sue and talk to her, and the initial scenes which they share in her hotel room, is something that both actors brought out superbly ‚Äì the awkwardness, the suspicions, and that hopeful look that something good might arise from all of the nonsense.\n\nThus began Mike&apos;s obsession with Sue when she allowed him that grace to fulfill a fantasy, and that translated to the borderline of stalking, where he dumps everything, and pursues her across state lines. Turning up at someone&apos;s workplace unannounced can have a very chilling effect, especially when one is only nothing more than an acquaintance and a one- nighter, to pass time and in an attempt to claw out of loneliness. After all, anything else is better than being holed up in your hotel room playing Solitaire on a computer.\n\nManagement is pretty much about the idealistic and pragmatic lenses that we wear from time to time in our view of romantic relationships. Here, it&apos;s a Mr Idealistic versus Ms Pragmatic in the approach. In Mike, we see someone with a hope of going beyond his comfort zone of his parents&apos; business, in the pursuit of a romance that he only wishes to turn out positively. There&apos;s no plan, there&apos;s no ulterior motive, there&apos;s only the want to be with someone and spend time with her, pure and simple. Heck he doesn&apos;t even have enough money to begin with.\n\nFor Ms Pragmatic, it&apos;s all about the plan, where such a situation will lead to, Complications arrive through the introduction of her ex-boyfriend Jango (Woody Harrelson), an ex-punk band member who is now an established businessman. This means a nobody Mike is against a somebody Jango, and presents a choice for Sue to choose ‚Äì the one for that undying romance, or the one who can pay the bills and allow her to continue hiding behind charitable causes to coast through life without spontaneity that the former may bring. It&apos;s a matter of love for genuine love of a person, or a love that is a matter of convenience and timing, which in itself is truly sad because you know that there&apos;s a compromise, which may not be for the better.\n\nThe film also went beyond the usual romantic elements, and tried successfully to insert other aspects of relationships such as family (Mike&apos;s Mom and Dad played by Margo Martindale and Fred Ward respectively), and friends. The role of Al (James Hiroyuki Liao) as Mike&apos;s best friend was curiously interesting as well, as here&apos;s an almost mirrored character in having a waiter working in his parents&apos; restaurant business too. Despite being present only in the middle act, Al&apos;s role served as comedic fodder, and to catalyze that life changing idea for Mike in learning to let go, but never forgetting.\n\nIn many ways, the character of Mike had reminded me of a younger self where caution is thrown to the wind with the chasing of skirts, in the same way zoning on that singular tree while forsaking the forest, never mind the issues of incompatibility that loomed in the horizon. Not a very wise move of course on hindsight, but given the intoxicating passionate nature then, I suppose that was that. Naturally between then and now I had realized that there had been irreversible change in our characters probably, and the ones in the past vaguely seem like distant characters who only remotely resemble who they are now.\n\nBut Management somehow was more hopeful and optimistic in nature, and I suppose that suited the movie just fine, bringing you through the stages of passionate infatuation to love through the power of naive sincerity. With an excellent selection of songs in its soundtrack, Management may just end up as a surprise when I compile my top 10 list for the year. For those who are looking for that little extra in a romantic comedy, then Management may just be that little gem which will set you thinking.",

(example - his tossing away of everything in the apartment without care). and just why would he care so much about Lola? a person he has not had contact with for decades! again - not enough character development to support the obsession and misery he endured on her behalf. it&apos;s just wasn&apos;t believable. and why would he steal the automobile? the telephone conversation he has with his father in which the father psycho analyses his son is just pointless by the time it shows up in the story.\n\nthe only shining actor is geraldine chaplin! she is marvelous as the caring but dominating neighbor and not enough of her side of the relationship with the mother is made clear. the writer is too mysterious with his implication that Lola and the mother had something going in their &apos;friendship&apos;. then the little Mexican boy - what? was that suppose to be Lola&apos;s son? not made clear. and the cemetery scene - again - what? sorry this flick is just too full of who, what, when, where, holes; and then he goes back to his lover in France. if you are a person that likes incomplete plot lines - check this movie out!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;80 Minutes&quot; seems at first as if it will be a low-budget version of &quot;Crank,&quot; but with an unexpected and fairly effective plot twist at the climax, it morphs into a low-budget version of an entirely different film, which I will not allude to, so as to avoid spoiling the surprise, other than saying it was an excellent film with first-rate talent. While 80M is limited by its budget, it manages to retain the moral and emotional B-story of the other film. \n\n80M isn&apos;t a great film, but it offers several satisfying plot twists, humor, witty banter and a lot of heart from its central characters. Production values are barely sufficient to convey the story. The three central characters deliver interesting performances, but many of the supporting characters lack depth. It&apos;s not without its faults, but it has its moments.",

S. soldiers infiltrating a Japanese stronghold with guns a blazing and tankards of firebombs billowing in the dark skies.\n\nWar is hell unless your name happens to be Captain Tom Reynolds (Frank Sinatra) in which case you get to enjoy first rate dinners and mixed drinks at fabulous hotels and view a naked Carla Vesari (Gina Lollobrigida) taking a bubble bath. Most shockingly, good old blue eyes restrains himself from jumping in that bubble bath with the Italian sexpot Gina Lollobrigida, and abruptly walks out of the luxurious hotels bathroom that is bigger than most families entire homes.\n\nSo, I must admit this Worl War II genre film was grossly exaggerating what war in the 1940s appeared t be like. Of course when the Chinese soldiers try to take advantage of a few dead American soldiers by looting, the courageous Captain Tom Reynolds places protocols aside and come hell or high water he seeks revenge alongside a small band of American soldiers.\n\nHoo rah! The war will be won with good old blue eyes leading the charge. I give the film a passable 6 out of 10 IMDb rating.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1987 in Germany, and the social problems reach a point where there are constant riots and chaos. In the middle of this problems, a group of 6 radical anarchists created a bomb that never exploded... 12 years later the bomb explodes and all the clues point to them. Now they must reunite, and try to eliminate the proofs because now they have grown up, some have children, some have promising careers... and some got stunk in the past.\n\n&quot;Was tun, wenn&apos;s brennt?&quot; is a very good movie by promising director Gregg Schnitzler that tells the story of this band of former radicals after 12 years of changes, social and personal. The movie flows at good pace, with good humor and feel-good attitude. Add to the mix an attractive young cast and you get this light comedy.\n\nProbably, that is both its greatest attribute and its greatest flaw: the fact that it has a lot of potential for being a deep character study filled with dark humor, but instead chooses the way of being a light hearted comedy with an upbeat tone.\n\nThe movie has very good camera-work, although it has that Hollywoodish feeling that may turn some people away. Those &quot;Hollywood&quot; moments are what probably hurt the film the most, with clich√©d scenes that distract us from the point for the sake of getting emotions.\n\nBesides its light tone, the movie manages to deliver its message; past returns to burn you. While Tim (Til Schweiger) and Hotte (Martin Feifel) are still living in the past, the rest of the gang tries to forget it, and ultimately it returns to burn them.\n\nThe acting was actually better than expected, with Matthias Matschke as Terror, the former punk turned lawyer (!) stealing every scene he is in. Also, it is worth mentioning the appearance of Klaus L√∂witsch as an old cop who still remembers those days before the fall of the wall.\n\nOverall an enjoyable movie that despite its Hollywoodish tone (complete with feel-good ending), it manages to be fresh and more inventive that most Hollywood light comedies. It&apos;s definitely worth a rent. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The World Moves On (1934)\n\n** (out of 4)\n\nFlat look at two families, the Warburtons and the Girards, who are bound by marriage in 1825 and form a business that places parts of the family in England, America and Germany. All is well until WWI breaks out and soon the families are torn on all issues. I&apos;ve read numerous reports saying that director John Ford never cared for this film and rumor has it that Fox was really hounding him to film screenplays the way they were written and not to go so far off track. Rumor has it that Ford did exactly that here and turned in a pretty lifeless movie just to prove a point to the studio. Of course, this has never been proved to my knowledge but if you watch the film it&apos;s easy to see why this might be the case. I&apos;ve seen dozens of films from the legendary director and there&apos;s no question that he&apos;s made some duds throughout but THE WORLD MOVES ON should have been a classic but the end result is so lifeless that you can&apos;t help but think there was something going on behind the scenes. Ford has always been great at showing patriotism but that&apos;s missing here and it plays an important part of the picture. There are many actions scenes scattered throughout but none of them contain any energy and they come across so flat that it seems like they just set the camera up and started shooting without trying to do anything special. This is especially true during some horrendous comedy moments with Stepin Fetchit, which are just so embarrassing that you really wonder what the director was thinking. I know Fetchit appeared in several Ford films and the image that he plays rubs a lot of people the wrong way but no matter how you view it the way the character here is used is just bad. Performances are pretty good from the leads (Franchot Tone, Madeleine Carroll, Reginald Denny) but they&apos;re certainly letdown by the direction. The look of the film is quite good and there&apos;s a very interesting story here but sadly it just never comes to life. I think with more care there&apos;s a classic movie here."

The performances range from dull to embarrassing, and all of the jokes fall painfully flat.  We are treated to what is essentially the same scene over and over again: a man and a woman have sex in a bedroom.  Here we find none of the adventurous nature of Michael Ninn&apos;s Perfect or the Mitchell brothers&apos; Behind the Green Door; only safe, repetitive love scenes.  The entire three hour (three friggin&apos; hours!!!) production reeks of the mainstream.\n\nIn contrast, the commentary track is quite entertaining.  Morgan, Stormy and... the other guy (Randy Spears maybe, I can&apos;t remember) seem to have pleasant rapport, and Morgan&apos;s jokes about one actor&apos;s grotesquely loose scrotum are downright hilarious (scrot-adactyl!).\n\nIf you don&apos;t have my aversion to mainstream product, you may be able to squeeze some enjoyment out of this movie.  Just remember to bring your fast-forward button."

John Wayne had come a long way from his low budget Lone Star film days.\n\n The film is considered a Western take on The Mutiny on the Bounty.  The relationship between Tom Dunson and Matt Garth is deeply complex.  Although they&apos;re prepared to kill each other, deep down they still respect for one another.  This relationship is based on control, idealism, respect, and trust.\n\n It takes a fascinating look at the cattle drive during the Wild West.  The film shows the responsbility that went with driving cattle across country and the different road blocks that many riders were faced with.  Red River(1948) shows that the cattle drives were a cowboy&apos;s main source of work.  City Slickers(1991) would do a wonderful homage to this Howard Hawks classic.\n\n Tom Dunson, Ringo Kid, and Ethan Edwards to name a few are some of the best characters played by the duke.  He exhibits here that he was a great actor as well as a great Hollywood star.  Its a shame that his best performances were overlooked by by many people during his lifetime(he&apos;s definitely a superior actor compared to the likes of Stallone, Arnold, and Willis combined).  It was actually filmed during 1946 but was shelved for two year due to a legal battle with Howard Hughes.\n\n Montgomery Clift stands out on his own as Matt Garth in acting next to John Wayne.  Walter Brennan is excellent in the role of Tom Dunson&apos;s sidekick. Red River(1948) was one of the best film to come out of 1948.  Red River(1948) contains a trademark flirtious man-woman relationship between Matt Garth and Tess that also evident in some of the director&apos;s other works...I.E., His Girl Friday(Walter &amp; Hildy), Ball of Fire(Potts &amp; O&apos;Shea), To Have &amp; Have Not(Harry &amp; Slim), The Big Sleep(Phillip Marlowe &amp; Vivian Sternwood), and Rio Bravo(John T. Chance &amp; Feathers)."

You always get the feeling she&apos;s just about ready to snap a full on crazy - but that kinda IS what is interesting about Sharon Stone. Sort of a female Jack Nicholson, but hotter in heels and a skirt.\n\nThe movie gives a snapshot of how we can all get lost in drudgery and mundane life. So don&apos;t view when you&apos;re really depressed. The film does a nice job with symbolism and there&apos;s an incident that unites the characters and pulls the story together. Good film to watch on a chilly night with some cocoa and buddy so you can have the discussion about how you feel SO much better about YOUR life and would NEVER slide into one of the character&apos;s way of life.\n\nI&apos;d give it a B-",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just finished watching The Bird People in China and have skimmed the other reviews on IMDb. Like most of the others, I do enjoy Miike&apos;s work, though not to the level of unconditional love that seems to be common here. In my limited experience, around nine Miike films so far, none have been a waste of time and several are fairly amazing. Notably Audition, though definitely not for the faint of heart.\n\nThis film left me with mixed emotions. It truly has touching moments, but it also suffers from common issues with Miike films... disjointed structure, unmotivated action (particularly from the Yakuza character), a bit of excessive violence, a kitchen sink approach to ideas... every possibility explored, even when simple would have been more effective, and finally a liberal borrowing from other films. In fact I&apos;m surprised this hasn&apos;t been mentioned in other reviews. Miike clearly took much of the premise and emotional content from the movie Local Hero. A corporate drone begrudgingly travels to a remote village and, to his amazement, is touched by the locals and the lifestyle. There&apos;s more to the similarities but I don&apos;t want to give away too much. Though I will note that he pays homage to his source material by throwing in a Scottish song as a major motif. I also didn&apos;t buy into the ending... it seemed to detract from the more realistic aspects of the film.\n\nAll of this aside, the film is worth seeing. The scenery is amazing and fairly unique, the photography handsome (considering the budget), Masahiro Motoki as Wada is quite good (as he was in Okuribito/Departures), many of the secondary characters are wonderfully drawn (another Miike specialty), it&apos;s genuine and funny at times, and it takes you on an unusual journey, an actual adventure... rarely a dull moment.",

Help comes in the unlikely incorporeal form of several ghosts - thieves who were executed for their crimes and who now seek to atone for their misdeeds. Things get really crazy when the Comtesse plays host to a foreign prince (Hans Clarin), but is arrested when her royal guest&apos;s jewels go missing.\n\nThe supernatural silliness sees the ghosts helping Charlotte with chores around the castle (these scenes employing plenty of fun old-school special effects), cooking up a recipe to become corporeal again, and in the amusing final act, trying to convince the Comtesse&apos;s love interest, Martin Hartog (Heinz Baumann), that they exist, to no avail (he&apos;s too drunk to appreciate their spooky shenanigans). For me, though, the film&apos;s most memorable moment comes when Hartog assumes the role of the castle&apos;s tour guide and proceeds to lead the visitors through the rooms at speed, everyone wearing roller skates hidden by oversized shoes (having said that, the &apos;race to the moon&apos; final scene is also extremely wacky!).\n\n6/10.",

On the other hand, the Anti-Japanese propaganda seems a bit overdone to an European audience who doesn&apos;t watch Kungfu flicks for the politics. But that is naturally a point an Asian audience will feel different about, so I&apos;ll ignore that and give 7 of 10 stars, anyway.",

The preparations call for both a rock- and a brass band, a mens choir and little children dressed up as bells to visit him at home. Meanwhile is son Hille is trying to study for his exams. Also causing a lot of distractions is elder sister Sibylle (the redheaded sheep of the family), leading to many confusing flashbacks involving their ill tempered father. On top of this the whole town seems to be going crazy: striking garbage men spoil an adulterous woman&apos;s fun, while nearly all the animals at the local pet shop die over night. Does it have something to do with the water or are the nearby factories to blame?\n\nShot documentary style with incredibly long and elaborate shots that would make even Brian De Palma jealous, we are constantly looking over peoples shoulders or even at their backs. Most scenes feature disconnected background noises like workmen in the street, alarms going off or church bells ringing (especially when our whiny narrator Hille interacts with girls ¬ñ talk about being obvious). It succeeds in giving the viewer a feeling of unease (the titular Unheil) and makes us expect something awful to happen at any moment. But the uneventful finale serves up more questions than answers. For aspiring steady camera operators and analyzing art house lovers only.\n\n4 our of 10 (for the camera work)"

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;Rollerball&quot; movie from 1975 was brilliant because although the film was violent, it was much deeper had a lot to say about humanity--our love of violence and how easily we can be led and controlled with sports. The film was brilliant on so many levels. So, some brilliant persons thought it was a great idea to update the film...make a new version which removed all the wonderful social commentary and left us with violence and not much more. Is it any wonder that the film is currently rated #39 on IMDB&apos;s infamous Bottom 100 List? After all, folks who loved the original were sure to be angry when offered a slick but neutered version of the classic.\n\nEarly into the film, I could see why many viewers disliked this remake. The game was totally changed. Instead of the relatively simple roller derby-style game, this one includes ramps, tunnels and explosions. But the part that got me was how confusing the new game was...and the announcer even said that the game was too complicated to explain!! Didn&apos;t this make the filmmakers the least bit concerned?! In addition, the film featured all sorts of eccentric players--with court jester hats, dragon masks and more. Now remember...the original film was AGAINST folks in the game standing out and being unique! To top it off, Jean Reno&apos;s character then is heard that he&apos;s happy that the integrity of the game has been maintained...unlike in other sports! Huh??\n\nThe bottom line is that if the original film had never been made, &quot;Rollerball&quot; (2002) would have still been seen as a poor film. But in light of how many people loved the original and well crafted it was, watching this film is sure to frustrate most viewers....especially since a remake didn&apos;t have to be terrible and mindless.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake doesn&apos;t get enough respect. George A. Romeo didn&apos;t get his original film copyrighted, so he ended up not making any money off the film because it wound up in the public domain. With this 1990 remake, he scripted a remake of his original film that&apos;s quite loyal to the original story and vision, but this time it&apos;s in color and amped up with plenty of gory and very realistic special effects. Of all the zombie movies ever made (and that&apos;s quite a few after the zombie film comeback following 28 DAYS LATER and THE WALKING DEAD), this film is the only one I can think of where the zombies really look like corpses (though the zombies on THE WALKING DEAD are quite good too). Romeo turned the directing reigns over to special effects maestro Tom Savini who does a fine job behind the camera. The special effects in the film are top-notch, AND even if Savini wasn&apos;t credited for the special effects or makeup on the film, his influence on capturing realistic corpses come to life cannot be denied. Tony &quot;Candyman&quot; Todd takes on the role of Ben, Patricia Tallman is Barbara, Tom Towles is a nicely obnoxious Mr. Cooper, and Bill Moseley is great as the short-lived Johnny. What&apos;s most fun about this film is how the story stays so loyal to the original film, outside of thankfully making Barbara a less helpless character, but that when the film deviates from the original for the last 25 minutes, it&apos;s kind of a mindblower for anyone who grew up repeatedly viewing the original film. It&apos;s like Romero added another half-hour of the story taking place after the events of the original film! On the downside, the film does feel rather stiff and even corny at times, but it&apos;s still one of the best zombie siege films out there.",

All the felonies that brought him in the news are not really my business. My only interest goes out to his directing skills and I can safely say he&apos;s one of the few directors out there that approach the genre with the right attitude. &quot;Clownhouse&quot; was a remarkable debut, mainly depending on atmosphere and suspense rather than on gruesome butchering. The plot handles about 3 escaped lunatics terrorizing 3 siblings in their house when they&apos;re home alone around the Halloween season. One of the brothers ¬ñ the youngest ¬ñ suffers from a severe clown-phobia and, since the madmen are all dressed up as clowns (they killed the clowns of a traveling circus), it will be one spooky fight for survival.\n\nSalva uses some clever camera angles and a ghastly soundtrack in order to increase the tension and this works perfectly. Also, the costumes and clown-grimaces are efficiently creepy¬Öeven better than Pennywise, still the prototype of clown-terror. The petrifying portrayal of the clowns will unquestionably cause some viewers to develop phobias, too. The acting performances are overall decent. Adolescent Sam Rockwell, who&apos;s very popular nowadays, plays the oldest of the three brothers. It&apos;s always intriguing to see successful actors in their earliest roles. Well, what are you waiting for?!? Send in the clowns!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Jeremy&quot; is a lovely story of two rather awkward, sincere teens who meet, fall in love, and part on a very sad note. Robby Benson is perfect in the title role, smart, funny but not obnoxious, quietly full of feeling for this little girl he&apos;s in love with. Glynnis O&apos;Conner is Susan, one of those shy, sincere girls that only seemed to exist in the &apos;70s. The New York City locations add a perfect backdrop to their story.\n\nThe sweetness and sincerity of the two leads is really something to behold, with no glamorizing or slickness thrown on to wreck it. Am I nuts, or was this a better time to be a teenager? I&apos;m old enough to remember when the kind of sincerity seen here was prized, and not that uncommon. For their first date, Jeremy offered a showing of &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; for crying out loud -- and Susan was thrilled! I&apos;m afraid most teens now would sneer at this. The music alone would sink it for most, yet at the time I&apos;m sure it was well-received. I was sad at the end of this not just because of the heartbreaking situation faced by Jeremy and Susan, but because of how far it seems we&apos;ve all gotten from the simplicity and sweetness seen here.",

      "reviewBody": "I had very low expectations going into this movie. It has absolutely no marketing or buzz factor (hence I am the first to review it on IMDb) and Matthew Lillard seems to be beyond his prime. Although the plot seemed very original and intriguing. After watching the film, I must admit I am hungry for more. The ideas are unique and the the story is beyond catchy. Without giving away spoilers, the story reminded me of looking at a photograph within a photograph. At first glance it seems too abstract to be realistic but once you uncover the idea behind it you are left memorized. Lillard gave a stunning performance beyond what I thought he was capable of. It&apos;s not just a slasher horror, yet an intense mystery thriller that could have twisted in any way, shape or form towards the end. After everything unraveled I found myself wanting to watch it again to full grasp the plot in a new light. Here we have a prime example of true film screen magic where it does not take a hundred plus million dollar budget or an A-list actor/actress in order to entertain. I give this movie a strong recommendation for anyone who appreciates it&apos;s respected genre and the art of film in general.",

What strikes me is that this was a time when states felt and acted more like small countries. It was rare for criminals to be persued across state lines because each was simply focused on their own territory and had their own budget. But this case is one that helped make all law enforcement rethink how things were done and began working together instead of individually.\n\nBased on the information in this film, I definitly believe Eric was assaulted rather than that he picked up hitchhikers. Otherwise, the crooks wouldn&apos;t have been hovering at the mechanic garage as if threatening. Because according to them, Eric wasn&apos;t yet under duress but he clearly was, according to the mechanic.\n\nIt was also a time when most citizens were too honest, like Eric&apos;s family. If it were in modern times even the most honest of us would have pretended to be Eric and signed all those documents it would have taken to get the records faster from the bank.\n\nAnd clearly the private detective is who cracked the case, God bless him.\n\nI think the garage should have been liable somehow for withholding information. They all covered for the guy or guys who pocketed the money even in the face of an investigation of a missing person. If that info had come out sooner the case could have been solved much sooner.\n\nI think people who don&apos;t believe in the death penalty are the ones who hold onto the idea of &quot;life&quot; actually being the life of the convict. Those who do are the ones who know that the only way to truely stop a serial killer for good is to take away his life - or disable him like cut off his arms, but ironically, people would think that&apos;s even more cruel and they&apos;d probably be right. To me, death is too good for them but I sure don&apos;t want them on the street.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a truly wonderful film.  It is an adaptation of the 19th century romantic poem by Alexander Pushkin about the tragic love affair between Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes) and Tatyana Larina (Liv Tyler).  Evgeny has inherited his uncle&apos;s provincial estate and goes to the country to put his affairs in order.  While there, he befriends Vladimir (Toby Stevens) who introduces him to Tatyana, the sister of his fianc√©.  Tatyana falls madly in love with Evgeny, but he brutally rejects her and leaves to return to St. Petersburg.  Upon returning years later to find her married, his regrets ignite into a passionate and obsessive love for her.\n\nThere has been some criticism of the fact that this film was produced by Ralph Fiennes to give a project to his sister Martha (director) and brother Magnus (original music).  Well, if this is the high quality wrought from Fiennes nepotism, we need more such collaborations.\n\n In her feature film directorial debut, Martha Fiennes gives us outstanding imagery, precise period renderings, innovative camera work, and dramatic lighting.  The locations, sets, costumes and props were fabulous. I especially loved the furniture.  The scenes on the dock by the mill in the fog were eerie and chilling.  One shot of Liv Tyler in a rowboat, shot through out-of-focus reeds in the foreground, was pure art.  The extreme close-up of the inking of the love letter added to the power of the emotions being written.  Remi Adefarasin (¬ëElizabeth&apos;) added wondrous cinematography to the list of filmmaking kudos.\n\nRalph Fiennes delivers another superb performance as Evgeny.  In the early scenes, he is cavalier, self absorbed, and arrogant to the point of being despicable.  His stoical dismissal of Tatyana was ice cold.  In the later scenes, he delivers a character so pathetically tormented by love that he wins back our sympathies.\n\nThis is by far the best performance I have seen by Liv Tyler.  She was poised, graceful and lovely, and gave an extremely dignified performance. With this role, she has proven that she can move beyond the troubled teen type and play a character with substance.\n\nThis is intelligent and inspired filmmaking.  I rated it a 9/10.  The pacing is deliberate, so action junkies will want to pass on this film.  However, for those who can savor a compelling love story with splendid imagery, this film should not be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "Damiano Damiani&apos;s 1966 film &apos;A Bullet for the General&apos; is one of the first examples of the Zapata Western, a sub-genre of the Spaghetti Western that mostly dealt with political themes during the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century. Gian Maria Volont√® plays El Chucho, the leader of a Mexican bandit gang who earn their pay selling arms to revolutionaries - he meets with a suave gringo named Bill Tate (played by Lou Castel) who claims to be on the run from the law and soon finds himself inducted into the group and deep in the heart of the Mexican revolution.\n\nDespite the simple sounding premise &apos;A Bullet for the General&apos; displays a great depth of character as the protagonists relationships shift with the plot before inevitably exchanging roles. The first hour or so seems like a standard western affair with lots of the usual train hi-jacks and bandit raids, but as the characters develop and their relationships become more strained we see some marvellous performances from the suspicious El Chucho, his brother El Santo (a fanatical Christian revolutionary played by Klaus Kinski) and the cool and un-flustered Bill &apos;Ni√±o&apos; Tate.\n\nThe doubt displayed by El Chucho towards Tate really sets up the finale, and as the film nears the heart of the revolution Tate&apos;s motives become clear - but that doesn&apos;t stop Damiani pulling a nice twist at the end, endearing Volont√®&apos;s character and providing a juxtaposition to the characters he made famous in some of Sergio Leone&apos;s classic Spaghetti Westerns. In a film dealing largely with role-reversal this is particularly apt.\n\nI didn&apos;t quite know what to expect from &apos;A Bullet for the General&apos;, I hadn&apos;t previously heard of the director and apparently this was his first foray into the Western genre - but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Providing a good mix of action and politics with commendable performances from Volont√®, Kinski and Castel &apos;A Bullet for the General&apos; is an intriguing and unique example of the Spaghetti Western and well worth your time whether you&apos;re a fan of the genre or not.",

Scriptwriter Solinas, himself, describes the film as a more accessible version of his screenplay for &quot;The Battle Of Algiers&quot;. Violent, stylish and with a refreshingly leftist point of view, the film wears its &quot;Yankee go home!&quot; message proudly on its sleeve.\r\n\r\nNow fully restored from the original Italian negative materials this forthcoming DVD release from Argent Films is the longest and most complete version of A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL available.",

      "reviewBody": "While the often noticed aping by Bertolucci of his hero Godard in this early film is quite true (even the film itself admits its debt to Godard right on screen), there is more here than mere imitation. Whether intentional or not I saw plenty of other influences from Bunuel, to the paintings if Rene Magritte. A loose, examination of schizophrenia; an inhibited intellectual young man spawns a separate self who is confident, aggressive and revolutionary. \n\nWhile vaguely based on Dostoyevsky&apos;s &quot;The Double&quot;, this is very much it&apos;s own story, and a hell of a lot of fun. I found Bertolucci&apos;s surreal playfulness more inviting than most of Godard&apos;s work from that period. It asks many of the same questions, and has much of the same distain for modern consumer society, (and film narrative conventions) but does it with an absurdist sense of humor that give rise to some moments that now seem as much &quot;Monty Python&quot; as they are French New Wave. \n\nThe most egregious Godard rip-offs can be annoying (sudden inappropriate music, etc), but they are for the most part mercifully brief. Mostly this is more influence and homage than theft, and creates a time capsule that still has relevance and interest, and pleasure in the watching. Pierre Clementi does a fine job playing the two different versions of the hero Giaccobe.",

A mix of French existentialist passion and a confused, complex east European feel add to its allurement.\n\nHow a film can so loosely, and yet successfully, hold together activities in the present, the past, Australia, Belgium, London, Bradford and Indonesia is mystifying.\n\nIt is certainly not a film to be understood in one sitting.\n\nA first viewing is just an invitation to go deeper. A second and third viewing starts to draw out the cinematic metaphors.\n\nThe grading, purchasing, teasing and cleansing of wool and its parallels with the stages and issues of the principal characters&apos; life experiences and relationships is subtle, if not initially tenuous.\n\nBy a fourth or fifth viewing the imagination is likely to be open to understand and build upon the film&apos;s light under currents and the key issues and challenges faced by each character.\n\nHowever, just like gliders going around in circles seeking the thermals to rise higher, so too are the characters realising that they too are trapped in respective professional, relational and emotional impasses, and that they need to look for guidance to navigate a safe landing.\n\nEveryone needs time to reflect, and yet that one commodity is in short supply for all concerned.\n\nFor each character help to confront their hurts and take steps towards a healing arrives, sometimes in unlikely forms - always out of the blue.\n\nEnjoy.",

She has to be the most beautiful woman ever, even compared to any Hollywood actress. After the song the film was going quite well Tusshar Kapoor had taken care of the whole movie but when the new actor ( I don&apos;t know his name) who played Ranveer Oberoi a business man &amp; he does not like to waste time, he spoiled everything I did not like him as an actor or his character. The story of the film is really old I knew the ending half way though the film but the cinematography was excellent. The songs are terrific composed by one of my favourite music composers Pritam. Every song is good and I like the remix version of the song Miss you everyday better than the original. Tusshar &amp; Kareena were the best, Ayesha Takia was OK but the other guy who played Ranveer was terrible someone else should have taken his place. I just don&apos;t understand one thing that when Tusshar &amp; Ayesha met the first time in Rocky&apos;s birthday party Ayesha&apos;s hair was flying all over when she was in front of Tusshar, how can there be wind indoors?, was there a fan in front of her? &amp; if a fan was in front of her then why wasn&apos;t Tusshar&apos;s hair flying? Overall 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Well, this drama has a very simple basic premise: it tells love stories of four couples with their own paths. Though it initially seems everything is OK, finally all their stories come into sad endings, just as the title indicates, &apos;Sad Movie&apos;. I&apos;ve been admiring Korean dramas for their fresh and original ideas, and this drama is no exception. Though some finds similarity with western movie (especially for its multiple storyline), it has been quite successful to develop its own distinctive feature, strong idea. Most casts are well-known actors (at least in Korea and Asia), and it surely delivers, they add significant points for this drama with their nearly flawless acting. And one more: great music, especially for emphasizing the &apos;sadness&apos; factor in the last part.\n\nSo, why don&apos;t I give it a 10? The reason is, there should have been more scenes. After finish watching this movie, you may wonder if there are missing scenes. Indeed the storyline is well developed and rather easy to follow, but quite possibly, you need to see this drama more than once (or read the spoilers) to perfectly understand the whole plot, for instance: &apos;how could she become XXXX&apos; or &apos;how suddenly he XXXX&apos; (I don&apos;t want to give spoilers, so I just write XXXX). This drama would be perfect if produced in a mini series (like Winter Sonata), but since it was produced as a single-episode drama (through noticeably plays longer than average single episode) some scenes were forced to be deleted, or never shot, where it could leave you clueless for a bit... And with all due respects to Korean cinema, and without decreasing my admiration for their brilliant ideas as I stated above, this is one problem I&apos;ve found in most Korean movies I&apos;ve seen: great ideas and storyline, but often lack proper (and often important) scenes to qualify for perfection.\n\nSimply said, if you like Korean (or in general, Asian) romantic drama and you don&apos;t mind the not-so-good ending, give this one a shot. Despite its flaws, it&apos;s still worth watching. Not the best Korean movie I&apos;ve seen so far, but it still deserves two thumbs up. It will not waste your time and money. And even if you have to watch it over and over again, to fully understand the plot, like I&apos;ve said, you will enjoy doing it. Trust me.",

But I had seen nothing until Noriko&apos;s Dinner Table. I haven&apos;t seen Suicide Club yet. I hope to see it soon, but in truth it doesn&apos;t matter: right now I consider Noriko&apos;s my new absolute &quot;best movie ever&quot; and that doesn&apos;t depend on what it&apos;s part of or what other films has ever directed its author.\n\nThere are personal reasons behind that election, of course, but then, isn&apos;t every election personal, and what other meaning could hide behind the word &quot;My&quot; in &quot;My Favorite Movies&quot;? \n\nOf course my familiar history or situation is or was extremely confusing, unstable, unhealthy, and unusual. But, maybe roleplaying is more than Japan&apos;s main existential issue. Maybe it&apos;s our entire culture&apos;s main existential issue. &quot;The actor behind the mask&quot;, as in &quot;Riding Alone for Thousand of Miles&quot;. The hidden heart, clouded in fat and entertainment and busy-ness, entangled in meaningless liasons that produce meaningless families; the confused heart that can only be brought out (exorcised) using a knife. And a camera. \n\nThe movie is divided into chapters, one for each of the main characters. And thus the viewer can achieve what the characters themselves can&apos;t: understand other people&apos;s motives and feelings. \n\nThis is my first review BTW, and will probably be the last. I&apos;m not into sharing my views or anything like that... But in this case the impact was extreme and the reviews here weren&apos;t doing it justice so far.",

      "reviewBody": "When his boss has a heart attack, mob hard man Chili Palmer finds himself working indirectly for Ray Barboni. Barboni&apos;s instance on picking through his books and finds the case of a dry-cleaner who owes money but is dead. With pressure to cover the debt himself, Chili sets out to find the man who he knows isn&apos;t really dead ¬ñ his search takes him to LA where he follows up another debt in the form of Harry Zimm. Zimm is a producer of trashy movies and Chili sees him as his way into the movie business and out of loan sharking ¬ñ businesses that he realises are actually not that different.\n\nWith the release (and drubbing) of the sequel, I decided to take the chance to watch the original film again and review it because I hadn&apos;t seen it since it first came out a decade ago. The story is potentially quite messy as it has quite a few threads with different characters coming and going quite quickly and it is to its credit that it manages to hold it all together and bring it off satisfyingly well. It doesn&apos;t have a great deal of depth of course but it only aims to be slick and it manages to do this pretty well considering. The script has plenty of injokes to match the slick dialogue and narrative and the story does move along in a manner that is enjoyable on several levels. I think claims that it is &quot;hilarious&quot; is maybe taking it a bit too far because it isn&apos;t really laugh out loud funny more than once or twice but it is entertaining in a stylish and slick way that makes it quite fun to watch.\n\nThe cast really help and the majority of them give enjoyable performances even if the aforementioned depth isn&apos;t there for them to do a great deal with. Travolta enjoys a funnier version of the role that gave him his mid-nineties comeback with Pulp Fiction and he handles himself well ¬ñ as slick as he is sleek and with a really cool presence that is important since the character is nothing more than cool presence. De Vito does really well sending up movie stars (specifically, if we are to believe all we read, Dustin Hoffman) but Russo seems to be an addition with nothing specific to do despite her still being enjoyable. Farina can do mobsters in his sleep so at least here he gets to enjoy himself at the same time; Lindo is a good match for Travolta and is a good bit of casting with good support from Gandolfini. In joke cameos are &quot;take it or leave it&quot; so they are not critical to the film but Keitel, Baldwin and Marshall stand out as being in there.\n\nOverall this is not a film that is hilarious or one that has great character development. Rather what it is is a slick story told with style and swagger ¬ñ much like Chili himself. The plot threads are helped by not ever having a lot of detail behind them to be picked up but they are still potentially messy and the film does well to bring them all together in a pleasing and knowing fashion. The starry cast is good value and all in all the film is entertaining; which was all I really wanted from it in the first place."

From the totally pointless/unrelated cheesy opening scene of HF on a shooting range, the lake chase scene, the whole buddy buddy chemistry (or total deliberate lack thereof) to the non stop annoying phone ringing or maybe the complete lack of an interesting plot? Some of these should have given away to most people the real intentions of this film.\n\nThe &apos;love&apos; scene with Harrison Ford should be the last clue to anyone blind enough, that this is really not to be taken seriously and can be considered made specially for Mystery Science Theatre.\n\nThe film is called &apos;Hollywood Homicide&apos;, I believe, so titled as to ruffle some Hollywood feathers with the notion that Hollywood has been killed by the never ending rain of terrible buddy cop movies. The real joke is that some suit somewhere probably OK&apos;d this as a real action movie.\n\nIn fact, the funniest thing is that some people took it seriously and enjoyed it as a serious action movie.\n\nThe chases are deliberately over the top lame (I mean really, really bad), the dialogue is so silly and pointless it just makes you laugh, the character development is totally non-existant, the cliches flow non-stop, the whole side plot of internal affairs is placed there because it&apos;s in every buddy cop movie, etc, etc. How anyone took this movie as a serious action film is beyond me.\n\nI give it 6/10 because, it&apos;s hilarious in places (in a MST kind of way), I agree with their intentions (THE COP FILMS MUST END!!!). Just please, don&apos;t take it anything more than a parody.",

This is about children being playful at first, cruel then and almost sociopaths as the story evolves. However, at times the film feels manipulative and that&apos;s why I can&apos;t give it more than 5 stars. The children are often so obnoxious and irritating that you just want to walk out of the theater. I understand that this is a part of the director&apos;s plan, but I prefer these things to be served in a more subtle way, that would have made the result so much stronger. The child actors are very good.",

Dom discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer.

Except for the tedious 1933 musical &quot;Going Hollywood&quot;, I was impressed by all of Bing&apos;s works and his sweet, aching crooning. \n\n&quot;Waikiki Wedding&quot;, sumptuously set in Hawaii, is one of Bing&apos;s best efforts, featuring such remarkable and beguiling tunes as &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot;, &quot;Sweet Is the Word for You&quot;, and &quot;Nani Ona Pua&quot;.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; as the best sounding song in the movie, the Oscar-winning &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; is really my favorite after repeated viewings.\n\nBing plays a publicity agent Tony Marvin working for a pineapple company taking part in a native wedding feast and becomes involved in a scheme to escort a beauty contest winner, played by Shirley Ross. Ms. Ross has a nice, appealing presence and does a very good job playing Bing&apos;s love interest and the &quot;Miss Pineapple Queen&quot; winner on her trip to Hawaii.\n\nI also enjoyed George Barbier, Martha Raye, Bob Burns, and an interesting early appearance by Anthony Quinn as one of the Hawaiian natives.\n\nFrank Tuttle&apos;s direction gets a little slack in the second half, but the music and Bing&apos;s timeless singing are all you need to enjoy &quot;Waikiki Wedding&quot;."

Rodriguez himself was never aware of his huge success, as well as most other Americans. This film traces two hardcore fans as they trace clues around the globe trying to find out what happened to this man. Did he commit a gruesome suicide as rumors say? If so, when and where? Almost nothing was known of this mystery man. The film unfolds a story that cannot be believed by any party. Not the South Africans, nor the filmmakers, or any member of the Rodriquez family. A story that you would swear would not be possible in this day and age of digital communications.",

I felt like I was the only guy over 20 at the theater, which I guess isn&apos;t surprising anymore. Did think there would be more adults, however, because the Green Lantern was something we read in my generation. Not sure if it&apos;s even around anymore. Being a fan of the comic book I had to go see it, and I was intrigued with the movie. After I got home I jumped on the computer and read the reviews. I was very disappointed with the professional reviews that cast stones at it, while at the same time, regular folk like myself thought it was a pretty good stab at the DC comic book version. I guess I look for something different when I go to the movies. I go to unwind and enjoy myself for a couple of hours, and Green Lantern worked for me."

Harrelson has never been better and Foster more than matches him all the way. It&apos;s emotional and engaging and genuinely painful at times. I had always thought how hard it must be to carry out such a job but had never really considered just what psychologically damage it could do long term to the person doing it. Harrelson depicts a man who has been doing the job far too long brilliantly and Foster in turn shows just what it can do to you initially. It&apos;s a perfect blend and the chemistry is excellent from start to finish. Deserves a much wider release and is with out doubt one of the best films of last year.",

No running water , a heating which breaks down ,pupils who do not care about what he teaches.Boisterous children who do not feel like going to secondary schools , because it would be a waste of time :every boy&apos;s ambition is to become a hunter ,and if he does not learn at an early age ,he will never be able to learn the tricks of the trade.\n\nSo what about learning history ,Luther and the Reformed religion?In a convential movie, the teacher would bring his reluctant students to &quot;true&quot; knowledge .The young Inuits eventually come to dominate their teacher : little by little, his way of life comes to resemble theirs,not the other way about .\n\nThus revivified by the people he wanted to educate (and their parents who were not really friendly,nay hostile :the lady hardly thanks the teacher who helped her boy to carry the heavy can ),he feels the &quot;call of the wild&quot; :then the movie becomes almost entirely a documentary (which it was, in parts,since the very beginning).\n\nThere are wonderful scenes of seal hunting ,with a snow storm which forces the men to build an igloo (which was always a shelter during the hunting time,and not a house where they live,as many children still think!);we are treated to the delight of an aurora borealis ;we are told an old legend , an &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; for Inuit kids;and because life is made of small pleasures and big griefs, we attend two funerals .(the minister is a woman ,which may puzzle some Catholic viewers.)\n\n&quot;Une Ann√©e&quot; Polaire &quot;(which in French sounds like &quot;Scolaire &quot; (school year),it&apos;s all this and more ;a great way to go off the beaten track of the French cinema .\n\nLike this ?

Catherine Deneuve has never been more believable as an &quot;ordinary housewife&quot; and her co-stars are just as impressive and convincing. Georges Delerue&apos;s music insures that the viewer gets all dewy-eyed at all the right moments. The result is what used to be called &quot;movie magic&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "So yeah, I started watching this and somehow or other I ended up watching the credits roll. That already puts it ahead of most movies. Partly I was just sort of fascinated, like watching a car wreck. Kind of wondering what would happen next I suppose. But at the same time I was genuinely entertained.\n\nThe dialogue is quite intelligent and very well delivered. And the story is interesting although tricky to follow if you don&apos;t speak the language and are depending on subtitles. Some very good acting by basically everyone. It&apos;s very fast paced which probably keeps you from being overwhelmed. You just don&apos;t get a chance to get mired in trying to figure out wtf is going on. I think there is a message behind this madness but I&apos;m not sure I understand it.\n\nWhich brings us to Experimental. It is a very non-linear film at times. The story doesn&apos;t start at the beginning but it does end with an ending, more or less. There are many many many jump cuts. With dialogue split at times between several different actors and even the crew stands in at times. The crew/camera is sometimes visible filming the scene, as if it&apos;s a movie about making a movie. Sometimes a scene is split between 2 different locations with the actors being in a different state of appearance and cutting back and forth between the two quite rapidly. I could probably say more here. But I won&apos;t.\n\nAnd that leaves Exploitation. And boy oh boy is there a lot of naked flesh on display! Both male and female full nudity with a few closeups. There is some implied homosexual content. There is a lot of swearing.\n\nThere is so much nudity that at first it seems like it&apos;s purely for titillation. But it isn&apos;t just young and attractive people. There are mature and less perfect bodies as well. Quite strangely there is no actual sex in the film. It is mentioned and one girl describes her molestation in somewhat disturbing detail. But there is no actual sex scene. So the nudity is mainly non-sexual in nature. Nonetheless, there are many times when the actors could have worn clothing or even underwear - but they don&apos;t. Some scenes seem to be simply included for effect. So yeah there&apos;s exploitation.\n\nTo bring this to a close: Should you watch this? Certainly! But you will need an open mind. And don&apos;t let your children watch it unless you are there to answer their questions.",

For its budget, or lack thereof, it&apos;s a dark miracle!\n\nRemorseless, insane, yet fascinating, Joe isn&apos;t easily forgotten. A cult icon in his native Brazil, Marins went to great lengths to preserve and project the character -btw, the fingernails are indeed real!- in his everyday life. Such dedication pays off!\n\nHaving passed on this past February (2020), we can be sure he looks upon our world and laughs satanically..."

      "reviewBody": "1974&apos;s &quot;A Black Ribbon for Deborah&quot; made three appearances on Pittsburgh&apos;s Chiller Theater (under its simplified US title &quot;Deborah&quot;), the third by special request, but found few fans or even a cult following in the decades since. Marina Malfatti stars in the title role of infertile bride Deborah Lagrange, whose scientist husband Michael (Bradford Dillman) acknowledges that what she wants more than anything else is a baby. Her obsession with children manifests itself in psychic fashion, as she first anticipates a circus acrobat&apos;s fall, then almost kills a medium, Herman Ofenbauer (Gig Young), with forceful energy during a demonstration. The journey home is interrupted by a vehicle that crashes off the road, resulting in the husband badly shaken, his pregnant wife fighting for her life. Eventually Deborah befriends the woman, Mira Wener (Delia Boccardo), whose calming influence comforts Michael, but it&apos;s only the calm before the storm as Deborah reveals herself to be pregnant, despite her doctor&apos;s assurance that it would take a miracle for her to conceive. It&apos;s difficult to warm up to any of the characters, particularly the often hysterical Deborah, though an obviously disheveled Gig Young provides necessary exposition while pumping some life into the draggy narrative. Dillman can do little with his one note character, who truly loves his wife but remains helpless to provide what she needs. With her short Mia Farrow-style hair, the attractive Marina Malfatti looks decidedly unappealing, keeping the audience from identifying with her increasingly shrill and unbalanced plight. No true Giallo, though there are some otherworldly goings on that carry a measure of frisson, but only for those viewers who manage to stay awake. Stephen Boyd&apos;s &quot;Marta&quot; was another Italian psychodrama that aired on Chiller Theater, featuring the considerable charms of Marisa Mell to carry it through in far more intriguing fashion than this turgid soap opera can muster.",

Like I said, it&apos;s no &quot;barn burner&quot; as far as innovation of movie plots, but it&apos;s funny at times and cute to see these actors can be silly and have a fun time.

Bonus at the end credits, that scene with Danning is repeated over and over again. 5 out of 10.",

This movie is really not meant to be taken too seriously.\n\nOnce we realized that, we actually enjoyed some of the bizarre moments they threw in there. The lawyer&apos;s strange family, the clerk at the shop ordering pizza, etc. I mean, there are so many totally random, bizarre little nuggets of humor that we were laughing in spite of everything else.\n\nEven the terrible Irish accents (that I couldn&apos;t quite place at first... I thought it was just a really thick Canadian accent, but then it kept changing the more the movie went on).\n\nSo, just sit back and chill and be ready for one heck of a strange ride.",

She lives in a palatial palace and is the general nuisance of her college. her class mate Mohan is from a lower back ground and studious . after the initial teasings and misunderstandings she starts liking him. she takes him to Bangalore and promotes him to GM of her hotel chain . She goes abroad for some work. in the mean time his mother Dubbing Janaki arranges his marriage with her brother&apos;s on Nalini. Mohan , unaware of Radhika&apos;s feelings agrees to this marriage and both start living happily with his mother in his new palatial bungalow . A few days later when Radhika returns , she expresses her feelings for Mohan who is shocked . He tells her that Nilini is carrying and he has no intention of divorcing her. Radhika tries to buy him and his mother with a lot of money but both refuse to let go Nalini. In a frenzy , unaccustomed to hearing No , Radhika falls down and commits suicide . At the same time Nalini gives birth to a baby girl . Radhika&apos;s spirit enters the child and starts tormenting the family . Baby Shalini starts by killing Mohan&apos;s mother who had refused her money proposal . After the initial doubt , Mohan starts believing that indeed Radhika&apos;s spirit has entered Baby Shailini and tries his best to get rid of her . Nalini refuses to believe all this . Jayshankar also calls a famous exorcist Satyaraj ( in one of his early roles ) to invoke Radhika&apos;s spirit to find out the cause of her suicide . A lot of spells , violence , exorcism later , all becomes well and Mpohan , Nalini and Baby Shalini start living with each other happily again . Over all a nice movie without much artificial special effects about ghouls or spirits. Baby Shalini is a treat to watch as a cute child with violent streaks . Mohan is very good as a gullible hardworking manager , obedient son and husband and then a deranged father , Nalini looks and acts nice as a housewife . Radhika is fine wearing modern dresses used to her riches and fancies . Over all a nice movie .",

That scary (oh so scary) scene in the fun house haunted me for a long time.  And Bette Davis, she is awesome."

      "reviewBody": "Two dedicated albeit crackerjack cops (Sylvester &quot;Sly&quot; Stallone and Billy Dee Williams) are on a new case: They must apprehend a slick, nefarious international terrorist and not to mention notorious criminal mastermind, Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer). Wulfgar&apos;s schemes thrive on the destruction of World Order and democracy. The two detectives, whose beat have always been the petty criminals of the street, have at first expressed animadversion when they are forced to nail the wily villain, Wulfgar. They have never encountered such an eluding antagonist before. No longer can the cops use conventional tactics, but they must resort to new, fresh methods...\n\nFor Wulfgar dissembles his identity with several incognitos, thus making him a tougher target to capture.\n\nNIGHTHAWKS is a well-mounted, well-paced thriller that puts the accent on suspense (with some bloodshed of course).  NIGHTHAWKS is a neat powerhouse! The movie contains riveting chases, a spectacle for a final confrontation, and an aggressively structured formula throughout the entire film. There are lots of opportunities for combustible moments in this film as well.\n\nWhat makes NIGHTHAWKS standout even greater and better than the ordinary action flick is its emphasis on characterization and morals.  NIGHTHAWKS does a terrific interpretation of how fascinating and surreptitious the terrorist bad guy is compared to a troublesome criminal.  Whereas the latter simply relies on survival and desperation in the derelict streets, the former is a very intelligent person with a respectively high I.Q. and an organized purpose. His mission is clear: to fight the oppressors who have destroyed his native land and people. The terrorist covers his tracks well and moves from location and location, making his presence less conspicuous. As for the heroic cops, Deke DaSilva (Stallone) manages to preserve ethics first when making a judgment before decisive action. He knows when to call out the shot.  DaSilva refuses to jeopardize innocent lives just for the sake of shooting down the villain, and in most cases, he has earned a level of propriety.  DaSilva&apos;s testament to moral values is also well demonstrated in NIGHTHAWKS.\n\nRutger Hauer gave a genuinely eerie and chilling performance as he portrays a very psychotic but also very convincing villain with a substantially bad attitude. Overall, NIGHTHAWKS is a high caliber action film. This &quot;above and beyond the call of duty&quot; type quality of motion picture is a consistently thorough and memorable film. This ranks among the finest cop dramas ever composed and for over a decade, this film&apos;s reputation and aura have managed to stand the test of time.  NIGHTHAWKS is a recommended hit.\n\n RATING: *** out of ****."

This movie does have a lot of Nudity yes, very true, but boobs only and nothing else not only that. The movie was able to make a Porn stars life very sentimental and interesting and it wasn&apos;t even unbalanced like &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; This movie had a very steady pace and had it&apos;s comedic moments when the Teenagers wanted to have sex with a pornstar therefore used all there brainpower and ingenuity and the characters Themselves realised it. Therefore they realised that if they input there brainpower and ingenuity to other forms of work they can make it! They can do something with there lifes.\n\nNot only that This movie is a lot more like a Drama then a Comedy, The moments where one of the friends fell in love with the porn star had a lot of Puppy Love and Sentimental moments where there acting shines and you got to know the characters much more. This movie also shows better emotions of how the friends Friendship and cares for each other in comedic ways.\n\nThis movie is very well done, it&apos;s not the most stylistic but the story is there, do not be fooled with the title of the movie, if you don&apos;t mind Boobs then you wouldn&apos;t mind this movies Nudity. The Jokes aren&apos;t even over the top like American Pie or Teen movies made in America. There more realistic like how one would that to there friend about sex.\n\nVery well done 9/10 for me!",

      "reviewBody": "BEAR CUB (CACHORRO) is a delight! This joyous film has the wisdom (and courage, if US standards are applied!) to open the doors and windows depicting a segment of the gay population who are healthy in attitude, in lasting relationships and friendships, and who don&apos;t swerve from addressing issues such as AIDS, single parenting, recreational dalliances, the dangers of drugs, and the importance of family. It is honest in dialogue, in casting, and in demonstrating that all people are subjected to the same ups and downs, no matter their sexual proclivity.\n\nPedro (Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez) is a successful dentist, a warmly human man who is surrounded by caring friends - primarily men who call themselves &apos;bears&apos;, a subunit of the gay population identified by hairy faces and bodies, stout husky physiques instead of the usual gay image of the perfectly carved gym body, and a live-and-let-live philosophy of upfront honesty, warmth and caring for their extended families. Pedro is openly gay, a fact that his widowed sister Violeta (Elvira Lindo) and her 9-year old son Bernardo (David Castillo) happily accept. When Violeta and her current paramour Borja (Cali Caballero) decide to vacation in India, Bernardo is left with Pedro for the promised two week stay.\n\nDuring their time together Pedro and Bernardo bond, Bernardo is introduced to Pedro&apos;s friends and is entirely comfortable by the healthy relationships he sees. Pedro is not partnered (his lover Eduardo died...) but he dates openly with Bernardo&apos;s knowledge. When Pedro is in his Dental Office, baby sitter Lola (Diana Cerezo) introduces Bernardo to go-go and other parts of the world outside and becomes a happy trio with the two males. News comes that Violeta and Borja have been arrested in India for drug trafficking, changing the two-week vacation into a time indefinite absence. Pedro and Bernardo adjust.\n\nThings take a turn when Bernardo&apos;s estranged grandmother Do√±a Teresa (Empar Ferrer) enters the scene, haughty, disapproving of Bernardo&apos;s living situation, and taking advantage of the absence of her hated daughter-in-law to attempt to gain custody of Bernardo, &apos;the only thing I have left in life.&apos; Due to some unfortunate twists of behavior and fate, Do√±a Teresa gains evidence to blackmail Pedro, not only because of his sexual outings photographed by her investigator, but because she discovers Pedro is HIV positive. In her attempts to denounce Pedro we discover the Bernardo already knows of his uncle&apos;s HIV status (as well as Violeta&apos;s) and Bernardo pleads with Pedro not to let Do√±a Teresa take him away. A compromise is reached and Bernardo is sent off to a coed school in Valencia.\n\nHow all of these twists and turns resolve constitutes the surprising ending of this excellent film: each of the characters is shown to be wholly three-dimensional, even Do√±a Teresa, and the overriding importance of family and compassion and love rules the day. The ending is open ended, allowing the viewer to select the way to conclude the story.\n\nDirector and co-writer (with Salvador Garc√≠a Ruiz) Miguel Albaladejo is a master at finding the core of truth in each of his characters, their individual life styles, and the unfettered joy of living uncompromised lives. The cast is extraordinary: Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez is a natural actor, David Castillo is completely believable as Bernardo, and the remainder of the cast is outstanding. The original music by Nacho Canut and Olvido Gara is so in keeping with the tone of the film. Yes, there are some consensual sex scenes in this film, but they are treated with respect and decorum and without them the flavor of the film would be lacking. This is a refreshing film about the sanctity of love - and it just happens to be populated with one of the most lovable gay groups ever created! Highly recommended.\n\nGrady Harp",

All right, there are some clich√©s, naiveties, implausibilities and stock shots (but aren&apos;t they part of the guilty pleasure we get from such chapter plays) but there are redeeming qualities: a convincing duo of actors (virile without Stallonian excesses), ok fight stunts and a galloping rhythm, whether the scenes are on land (in a car), in the air (in an airship or a flying wing) or under the sea (in a submarine). Plus some clever finds, including the final revelation of the identity of the big bad guy. To be consumed without moderation... provided you have kept your child&apos;s soul.",

It was a bit of a last minute pick, and it has been my favourite film so far, and probably one of my favourite films in general. To be simple, I will just say that this film is about life and the emotions and experiences that we all go through within it. Christopher Plummer plays a 75 year old man who after the death of his wife is finally able to explore his homosexuality, and we see him come to life through this experience. It is not only about him, but mainly about his son played by Ewan McGregor, whose relationships with both his mother and father shape him as a person. These relationships and his own romantic relationships make up the core of his character, and it is through love, loss and discovery that the three main characters display an authentic view of humanity. It is an original film, and requires a certain audience, but I recommend that everyone should see this true gem.",

      "reviewBody": "This early silent movie by Ozu is a one of the typical example of the simplicity of the director. This movie takes place almost in the same environment with very little changes, students bedrooms, mountain resort, sky sloops and bedrooms again. The external scenes are unfortunately a little bit spoilt by the early cinema technology, but still there are some rather catching shoots, one worthy considering is the one where the directors shoots the young man and the wanted lady from behind while they are side by side enjoying the landscape. The two male actors are quite into their part as the student playboy and the shy bookish boy, while the girl looks just like a mere inanimate object around which the whole plot is carried out, but her lack of expression and preferences is perfectly undertaken by the actress and definitely wanted by the director.\n\nOn the whole it&apos;s a nice easy film, that shows how young students lived like in those days, besides we get to know that things have changed little and that some things are common in any part of the globe. The typical love-triangle is well carried out and in the end the friendship between the two mates is not spoilt by their misadventures and neither the playboy nor the shy could take advantages of the young lady. Moreover all their efforts ended up to be vain, but since they are young and happy they could accept the fact without regretting to much about it. Ozu tells us perfectly how sometimes we should laugh at our youth mistakes or bad luck, instead of letting them driving us crazy. To make a long story short: a brief worth seeing piece of youth everyday life."

      "reviewBody": "So many people have complained about the Gertrude Lang character (Alicia Witt), Holland&apos;s interaction with her, and the purpose of the character, and I am simply amazed at the hostility.\n\n1) &quot;Playing the sunset&quot; was Holland&apos;s way of getting Gertrude to relax so she could play the notes fluidly. They both knew that she didn&apos;t sound professional, and wasn&apos;t going to. The idea was to get her just above the level of making a fool of herself as she did the first time he called on her in class. Then she could, and did, perform in the band without dragging down the whole ensemble.\n\n2) Her goal was not to be a professional musician. Did no one else hear her speech about &quot;I just wanted to be good at *something*&quot;? She listed all the fabulous achievements of her parents and siblings, and concluded, &quot;I&apos;m the only one who&apos;s...&quot; The missing word would have been &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;worthless&quot;. Or &quot;a failure&quot;. Thirty years later she&apos;s the governor (not the mayor!), because in 1966, Holland helped her gain confidence for the first time.\n\n3) She wasn&apos;t &quot;wasting&quot; Holland&apos;s efforts by going into politics. Art, music and theater education don&apos;t exist solely to create professional artists, musicians and actors. They also exist to give young people an opportunity for change and growth, even if they never use a paintbrush again.\n\nI liked that plot twist. Almost every high school has an alumnus who has achieved something in art or entertainment, but a lot of people sell one painting or appear in one film and become a hero to their home town. But there are only fifty states, and it takes an extraordinary amount of drive to become governor of one of them. It&apos;s unlikely that she would have taken that first step towards empowerment without Holland."

Told in a somewhat more lengthy manner, it&apos;s less about the action elements and more about the relationships between the characters.\n\nPaul Valery is caught stealing jewelry and goes to prison. His treacherous accomplices get away with the loot. Professor Kr√ºger (Van Johnson) and his assistant Gloria (Lucretia Love) free Paul (afterwards he looks like Antonio Sabato again) and subject him to facial surgery. A new break should rise. But Paul has a desire for revenge. This is especially true for Hans Fischer (Klaus Kinski)...\n\nGreat music by Carlo Savina, typical Italian flair, but the production doesn&apos;t really get going. Director Roberto Bianchi Montero didn&apos;t cover himself with fame. But it&apos;s definitely enough for friends of the genre and the actors involved!",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Liegen lernen&apos;, which could be translated as learning to lie down, is the story of Helmut, played rather dryly by Fabian Busch, during that period of life when one tries out relationships until one decides what one wants from life. Although the political developments leading up to and after the unification of Germany are kept audibly and visibly as a recurring feature, they are only a backdrop to the tale, and do not form or even affect the plot.\n\nBecause of the dryness of Helmut&apos;s character, the voice-overs throughout the film are necessary for the viewer to get an insight into his personality and development. Whilst there have been many more interesting lead characters, the realistic handling of the feelings and conflicts of this crucial phase of personality building makes the unfolding of the plot somewhat fascinating.\n\nThe same story with identical characters of both sexes could have been told in any city or larger town in any modern country, but at least the changes in East Berlin add an extra deepness to the drama of economic progress, which in the context of this film are kept even more moderate as I personally have experienced in West Germany.\n\nThe film is directed by Hendrik Handloegten, but, as in many Rainer Werner Fassbinder films, especially &apos;Berlin Alexanderplatz&apos;, whilst the male roles are convincing, the female roles do not quite seem to fit into the background in which the events take place. They are fun to watch, but simply not realistic enough to be convincing. Britta, played by Susanne Bormann, lights up the screen and enhances the entertainment value even more than Gisela, played by Fritzi Haberlandt, and the others.\n\nThe pace is sometimes too slow, and, although the female characters are in some ways too extreme, in other aspects they fail to generate as much contrast as those in &apos;L&apos;Homme qui aimait les femmes&apos; or even &apos;Dr T and the Women&apos;. However, this is understandable because this film is not attempting to portray the infinite variety of the female character in modern society, merely following a particular man&apos;s life in an important period of his life.\n\nThe film is entertaining, but fails to make the most of the dramatic possibilities.",

      "reviewBody": "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) ****\n\nStarring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen Director: Spike Jonze   Running Time: 113 minutes   Rated R (for sexuality and language)\n\nBy Blake French:\n\nIt is not every day that I use words in my movie reviews such as unique, creative, inventive, imaginative, original, fresh, mesmerizing, and unmatched. Under the circumstances of &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea, I find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved. Everything about it is labyrinthine, intriguing, and very funny. It is one of the years best films, and should be well presented come Academy Award time.\n\n &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; details the relationship between Craig and Lotte Schwartz. They basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside. Lotte is a typical, unattractive homemaker while Craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer. Desperately searching for employment, Craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall, forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk around.\n\n One of those employees is named Maxine, a highly seductive co-worker of Craig&apos;s. When he asks her out for a beer one night, Craig experiences lustful thoughts about her, and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herself.\n\n As you can see, the household isn&apos;t exactly a joyful situation. All things change, from blossoming sexual confusion to inner self-esteem, when Craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office. It is tucked away, hidden acutely well in a dark corner, which is found mysteriously by accident when Craig droops a paper behind the cabinet. After Craig explores this deep miniature, seemingly endless hallway, he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, then spits you out along the roadside afterwards.\n\nWow, sounds like &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; doesn&apos;t it...well, sort of.  Craig first tells his co-worker about his discovery, who continues to think he&apos;s nuts. Then, after explaining and showing this portal to his wife, who is hysterical, Maxine begins to believe Craig, and concoct a devilish idea. To sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity. The tagline: Ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can.\n\nIt is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between Craig and then Lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved: the couples dead-end lives are lifted in glory. This creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act. Perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads; Lotte and Maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists. The two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of Malkovich, and the other experiences the actual Malkovich. It is a beautifully crafted structure, with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picture.\n\n Also first rate here are the performances. Although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in, they do a wonderfully energetic job. Cameron Diaz is flawlessly cast as Craig&apos;s sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife, and delivers us a comically riotous character. John Cusack as Craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer, and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character. Also quite good here, John Malkovich, who has much more of a difficult role than one would think. He has some hard scenes where Craig controls him while inside his mind, which requires great skill to perform.\n\nHowever, better than any performance, and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot, is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of &quot;Being John Malkovich.&quot; With such a penetrating, magical atmosphere to it, it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing. Although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film, wouldn&apos;t it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama, or perhaps as a spiritual awakening picture.\n\n Regardless, the film still has an oddly powerful message to it, which I will not, nor do I ever directly reveal in any of my reviews. You see, since different individuals come from different backgrounds, and thus see things differently. It is because of this that I do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own. But I will say that &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; might not overtake the box office, but for appreciative movie patrons, this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to come.\n\nBrought to you by Gramercy Pictures.",

      "reviewBody": "I stumbled onto this film being shown 5/14/2006 on Spike TV. The stunning production work caught my eye in the opening battle scene. The color photography throughout this film is first rate. The film is entertaining from beginning to end. According to IMDb, this is the only film Jet Li has directed. His direction is first rate. This is a Chinese version of a film of soldiers fighting and coming home from the war, in this case World War 2. The film primarily focuses on the exploits of one soldier returning to a town where his buddy, a lieutenant in the marines, lives. He becomes involved in the life of his friend, the friend&apos;s daughter and the goings on in their town. The town is occupied by some American sailors who like to run roughshod over the Chinese occupants. Conflicks take hold. There is a style in this movie of words that I cannot find, but it is entertaining and at a very high level than the few pictures that I have seen out of China. There is a wonderful &quot;gritiness&quot; throughout the movie. Two scenes that demonstrate this is the group of Chinese soldiers playing their little wind instruments marching down the street and the fight scene in the driving rainstorm in the bar. Great movie!(added 05/15/2006-The style of this film for some reason reminds me of GUNGA DIN).",

      "reviewBody": "Patently predictable and lame sci-fi / horror thriller, the umpteenth variation on the familiar &quot;Alien&quot; story. (But hey, at least they&apos;re up front about what they&apos;re ripping off.) A sextet of scientists work deep underground (five miles beneath the earth, to be exact), not knowing the full extent of what their work entails. It seems that the twisted, eccentric genius in their midst, Newton (Kevin Alber), is doing - you guessed it - cutting edge genetic experimentation, from which he hopes to profit big time.\n\n&quot;Alien Terminator&quot; is a yawn-inducing example of the &quot;same old, same old&quot; when it comes to this kind of genre storytelling. The filmmaking isn&apos;t so incompetent, or cheap, that it makes one laugh, unfortunately. It&apos;s just boring. Everything about is is just barely adequate, without the redeeming nature of unintended chuckles. It&apos;s too hard to care about this tale, or about its characters. The actors aren&apos;t unlikable, but their characters are just inane. The incredibly sexy Maria Ford offers some fun playing a tough talking, Ellen Ripley style action babe. The most endearing guy is the doctor, ironically named &quot;Coach&quot; (Bob McFarland), who disappears from the story too soon. Alber is very annoying playing the greedy oddball with the hidden agenda. And yes, folks, since this is a production of Roger Cormans&apos; New Concorde company, you can expect a dose of sex and partial nudity.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to imagine even die hard aficionados of this variety of entertainment being quite enthused by this one.\n\nFive out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The spaghetti western is a curious subgenre of exploitation cinema. The best ones are brilliant, and in my humble opinion there aren&apos;t any truly bad ones out there. There are just a whole lot of them, maybe hundreds, that simply... exist. Like &quot;Death at Orwell Rock&quot;, for instance. It&apos;s not a particularly bad western, it just isn&apos;t any special or memorable whatsoever. The film follows the typical structure of a stranger arriving in a corrupt town, and gradually it becomes clear that he&apos;s on a personal mission to settle an old vendetta. It&apos;s watchable enough, and the script does contain one of two ingenious moments (like an identity swap and a feisty finale), but it doesn&apos;t differ much from the previous 10 you have seen, or the next 15 spaghetti westerns you&apos;ll watch. There are a couple of familiar Italian cult-faces in the cast, like Luciano Pigozzi and Nello Pazzafini, and they deliver largely on autopilot, just like director Riccardo Fredo whom I prefer when he makes gothic horror movies or Gialli.",

      "reviewBody": "Written by the director of the famed Trinity comedy western films and directed by man who helmed 3 of the four official Sartana films, this outing works and doesn&apos;t at the same time.\n\nThe story of two greenhorn brothers fighting against a gang terrorizing ranchers is trite and only provides a reason to bring together the two main characters of the movie, Ace of Hearts/Cemetery (played by Garko) and Duke (played by Berger). Both are uber-cool bounty hunters who know and respect each other well and find themselves in a situation where they are working for opposite sides. Whenever these two actors are on the screen, either together or solo, the film is interesting. The direction is uneven as well, sometimes it&apos;s very stylish and well photographed, other times banal and full of gratuitous zooms. The script might have worked if the English actors who were chosen for the greenhorn brothers weren&apos;t so miscast. Bruno Nicolai&apos;s theme for the film is great but, like many of these films, it is repeated to the point of near insanity. The audio is very muffled in the English soundtrack and the print going around at this time is slightly cropped.\n\nSo it&apos;s not a complete waste of time, if a better print ever shows up I might watch it again.",

      "reviewBody": "Certainly this has to be ranked as one of the most forgettable films GREER GARSON and ROBERT MITCHUM ever participated in, a film that went from bad to worse once it was handed over from one director to another at least three times.\n\nIn the end, nobody wanted to take credit for it and it&apos;s easy to see why there is no &quot;Directed by&quot; credit on the screen. It&apos;s a mess. Not only did the directors quit, but ROBERT MONTGOMERY began filming in the Richard Hart role until he dropped out and was replaced.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of the film is the handsome seaside setting and house that Garson lives in, until a stranger comes along (RICHARD HART) to inform her that her husband (MITCHUM) is dead and that he was Mitch&apos;s best friend during World War II. Garson is soon offering Hart shelter and their relationship seems to be heading toward a romantic involvement when the very much alive Mitchum returns to town, seeking to resume his former life.\n\nActually, these are the ingredients for a potentially strong enough story--so one has to wonder why the film turned out so disastrously. Mitchum was reportedly annoyed with Garson when she required, according to him, &quot;125 takes to say &apos;No&apos;.&quot; (Knowing Mitchum, this could have been a slight exaggeration!!) Nevertheless, he often spoke disparagingly of the whole project.\n\nCan&apos;t recommend this one unless you are a staunch Greer Garson fan and won&apos;t mind the punishment.",

Unfortunately, he was mostly prolific in Spain, and therefore little known in the United States. I wonder what other gems he has to offer and how easy they would be to track down...\n\nThis film also features the debut of Ingrid Pitt, which has to be worth something. This is a cheap horror film (invisible dinosaurs are about as inexpensive as it gets), but having Pitt in there makes it quite important in retrospect...",

The Orchestra Music, I believe was by John Barry was also wonderful. Reminded me of the kind of great music in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; and even a one song in &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;. It really moves you and you&apos;ll never forget where you first heard the songs. The main theme is &quot;Peggy Sue&apos;s Homecoming&quot;, or is it &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; by John Barry; its one or the other, for sure . I wish that Hollywood would bring out more shows like this...some romance, nostalgia, no real violence, no swearing AND yet it was a hit! Wonderful! I must admit that I&apos;m a nostalgia fan and movies like this one, all the back to the future shows have me fascinated. Perhaps it&apos;s because we often find ourselves daydreaming of the good old days and simpler times...far removed from the hectic pace of today. Heck, I even love watching reruns of the Waltons! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone...cozy up to your TV with a good friend, make some popcorn, put a fire on and ENJOY! How could anyone NOT love this movie!"

Rather than turn them into effigy, he allows them to have epiphanies, realizing their inner hollowness, and taking different paths to self-fulfillment. &quot;Teorema&quot; means &quot;theorem,&quot; and in this case, the mysterious, beautiful stranger embodied by Terrence Stamp offers proof of a certain Italian bourgeois family&apos;s misgivings. Pasolini here offers a lucid statement, less political than Bunuel, but just as poetic. His execution, however, is dry and hokey, as Stamp encounters each family member almost mathematically. While the actors provide genuine emotion (particuarly in facial expressions, which Pasolini, in his entire body of work, has shown overwhelming appreciation for), the structure of the film is so tight that he almost sucks the life right out of his message. It&apos;s a curious film, though, not completely lacking in entertainment value. In a way, it plays out like a sonnet or other tightly structured poem type. Recommended is &quot;Porcile,&quot; made by Pasolini, with similar themes, but presented more organically.",

The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it&apos;s characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it&apos;s movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."

There&apos;s some hilarious scenes, and the acting is a riot. My favorite guy is the doctor with the glasses. I was so sad when he died. Half of the cast and the Drones look like the directors&apos; neighbors. They don&apos;t even bother to do another take when they trip over their lines.\n\nOverall, not bad but there&apos;s better bad/good movies. Like Never Too Young to Die!"

Lots of would be comic impersonations.\n\nThe film is handsomely mounted on a small scale by the great Rohrig &amp; Herlth team and was probably nicely filmed by Franz Planer, even if the U-Tube copy is fuzzy and wobbles as if it was copied off a projection on a bed sheet."

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised to see zero reviews in IMDb for this classic, one of Michael Raven&apos;s best features. How quickly they forget.\n\nIt features Julia Ann in a terrific role, playing against her title beauty as an evil scheming character who torments our sympathetic heroine Stormy. The two actresses have teamed up several times on screen, and this was an important feature in which one Blonde goddess sort of passed the baton to an up and coming future and similar icon.\n\nThe costumes, styling and visual style suggest 1940s film noir, but shot in color. Stormy and sympathetic co-worker Devin Lane slave away at Julia Ann&apos;s business, but Julia becomes jealous of Stormy&apos;s beauty and the attention paid to this underling. It soon becomes apparent, amplified by the clever character names in Raven &amp; George Kaplan&apos;s script, that this is an adaptation of Snow White (with a dollop of Sleeping Beauty thrown in).\n\nSo will Stormy hook up with Erik Prince, played by Brad Armstrong as a suave businessman hatching big deals with Julia Ann? Or will the evil villainess, named Ellen Queen, prevail? It all unfolds in stylish visuals shot by Raven himself, and several dramatic scenes worthy of a mainstream film. I&apos;ve been watching a number of Michael Raven clunkers lately, but this baby counteracts a lot of the bad karma those losers generate. \n\nDefinitely a must for any Julia Ann fan and a fitting introduction to the great career unfolding for Stormy Daniels."

For example a dubious woman, an elder man who knows the jungle (Whitman) and an old Nazi from Germany (great as ever: Pleasence). Not only are they trying to outwit each other, but they also have to fight blood thirsty crabs, crocodiles and other animals, and not to forget a vicious tribe of Indios who like to behead their victims as soon as they capture them.\n\nRene Cardona jr. surely didn&apos;t have that a big budget for this film, but he certainly does the best with it. Concerning gory effects, that is. In the most outrageous scene, a hapless adventurer gets his eyeballs ripped out by the vicious crabs, a scene which has to be inspired by Lucio Fulci&apos;s notorious spider-scene in &quot;L&apos;Aldil√† - The Beyond&quot;.\n\nThis film is very trashy, but it&apos;s better entertainment than any other adventure film I know (the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-trilogy included), and it boosts a great role for horror veteran Donald Pleasence (as a really unpleasant guy) and enough nasty bloodshed to please every gorehound who wants to see something else for once.\n\nThat&apos;s what I call good, mindless fun!",

Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!\n\nThe plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before.

I am an odd 40 plus man who enjoys fluffy teen movies and romcoms when I&apos;m in the right mood, so this looked like it might be fun.\n\nYa know what? It IS fun. The title character could so easily have been a brat, and even at the beginning when she is little miss rich girl she comes across as likable, and I feel this is due to very good casting with a girl who is sweet but not at all sexual or threatening.\n\nThe basic storyline isn&apos;t exactly rocket science, and only differs from similar movies because it has a very lovely horse in it, not to mention the ever reliable Kris Kristofferson. The film is made through the top notch casting, the bubbliness of the lead actress and the delightful way it flows along without asking too much of the viewer or getting at all dull.\n\nWatch the trailer, and if that makes you curious give it a go, because it&apos;s a good film that should suit the whole family.",

      "reviewBody": "For those who do not play chess or know anything about it, the game is something that is commonly referenced in books, poetry, movies, etc. It is seen as somewhat of a metaphor for happenings in real life. For those who play chess and are in love with the game, it is something of an art or science, or something cosmic that is unexplainable. They may often be frustrated as to why the majority of society does not share their passion.\n\nChess has survived for thousands of years and is arguably the hardest game in the world. Through the eons, if there is one name or one master that has towered above anyone else, it is the American Bobby Fischer. When Fischer defeated Boris Spassky in 1972, the match created more publicity than any other chess event in history (even more than when IBM&apos;s computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1996). A lone American had defeated the mighty Soviet chess machine during the cold war. What should have been just the beginning of an already great career for Fischer, it was actually just the end.\n\nBobby Fischer made one of the great disappearances of any famous person of the 20th century. He did not die, but was as elusive as Bigfoot after he won the world championship. For those who encountered him only would end of becoming frustrated because they realized he was slowly going insane. 20 years after winning the Championship (1992), Fischer reappeared to play Spassky for another match. When he appeared, it became even more obvious that the man had lost his mind. When the September 11th attacks happened, Fischer shocked the world when he applauded the acts on a radio program. He never played again and passed away in 2008.\n\nThis HBO program is fantastic in that it is presented in a manner that is suitable for those who barely know anything about chess or those who know the intricate details of Fischer&apos;s career and life. It keeps the viewers&apos; attention by playing nice music in the background throughout. The program shows numerous photographs and television footage that most people have never seen. The central focus of the program is the Fischer - Spassky match of 1972, but it juxtaposes all kind of other topics such as Fischer&apos;s family and love life, and his affiliation with a cult group. The program even has Henry Kissinger talking about the match. Kissinger had encouraged Fischer to follow through with the match when Fischer was about to not show up. But, the program does not blame Fischer&apos;s religious obsession with chess for this mental breakdown. It posits that it could have been a possibility.\n\nI will have to strongly disagree with one part of this documentary. It stated that when after Fischer won the world championship, he was arguably the most famous man in the world (aside from Jesus). I find this really hard to believe. One because Fischer was a merely just a chess champion and (2) there were many other gigantic figures at that time; Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon, Chairman Mao, just to name a few.\n\nIn the end, the enigma will always remain the enigma. Nobody really knows why Fischer quit playing after 1972 or what caused his mental disintegration. Even though he forfeited his title to Karpov in 1975, why did he completely give up playing even tournaments and simuls altogether? What we are left is speculation. Many chess lovers will proudly proclaim that Fischer was the best player of all time. There maybe some truth to this, but I believe Garry Kasparov finally deserves this title. This is because Kasparov was willing to take on all comers, human beings or computers. Kasparov did this for almost 3 decades. Kasparov defeated an ongoing Champion Anatoly Karpov (one of the top 5 players ever) 5 times and he continued to defend this title beating brilliant and talented young players - Ivanchuck, Shirov, Topalov, Anand, Short, Leko, Kramnik, Kamsky, and so many others for another 2 decades.\n\n*Please do not comment if you are going to get into a &quot;greatest ever&quot; debate - it will be yet another endless discussion and will lead to nowhere.* Fishcer&apos;s story is one of the great tragedies of chess, but in the short time that he was brilliant, he shined so brightly that it continues to illuminate to this day. Although his life ended to a sad decline, keep in mind, we remember and admire him for what he produced.",

Laws of Attraction is a rather well-worn comedy though that lacks sparkle. Two top divorce layers battle it out and eventually get romantic about each other. If the script sizzled it might be able to hold a candle, but it doesn&apos;t - which is a great shame given the great performances (Pierce Brosnan also does well, appearing far less wooden than in his James Bond roles). The whole film has a rather contrived feel to it that no amount of acting talent can salvage. Throwing in a bit of Irish countryside seems gratuitous in the extreme, a bit of cutesiness for the American box-office.",

Thus, follows a series of comedic moments, that lead to a long-drawn culmination.\n\nAs a film, &apos;Deewana Mastana&apos;, at best, can pass off as a time-pass entertainer. To be really honest, it&apos;s mainly Govinda&apos;s fantastic performance that works the most &amp; he is without a doubt, the biggest strength of the film. Sure, there are moments that truly bring the house down, but, in the second-hour, the film drags itself a bit too much &amp; loses pace.\n\nThe Writing Material is entertaining in the first-hour, but slips quite a bit in the second-hour. David Dhawan&apos;s Direction is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are passable. Songs are hummable.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Govinda, Govinda, Govinda. He delivers a fantastic performance, and owns the film. Anil Kapoor is alright. Juhi Chawla does well. Anupam Kher is top-notch. Johnny Lever is genuinely funny. Shakti Kapoor is fair, while Satish Kaushik leaves a mark. Salman makes a cameo in the climax.\n\nOn the whole, Watch it for Govinda.",

      "name": "Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is basically a bromance).",
      "reviewBody": "What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren&apos;t  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You&apos;ve got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That&apos;s it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can&apos;t. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don&apos;t understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik&apos;s best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that&apos;s  okay, since this isn&apos;t THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw&apos;s two henchmen don&apos;t get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it&apos;s a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it&apos;s the Magneto helmet or  Mystique&apos;s everyday clothes, you are always admiring &apos;the look&apos; of  what&apos;s on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven&apos;t been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.",

Well, if you say this film is a satire on the Polish Communist years, then, the question easily arises why more than 50 % of Poles still recollect the Soviet years with a great warmth and nostalgia? Let&apos;s put the political problems aside. The movie, then. It is a shame to have made such a shallow and humorless try in the style of Monty Python but with much more cynical (and not funny) sexual innuendos, with less humor and less tact. The top (or, rather, the bottom) of this vapid film is the moment when a dwarfish man get into a female vagina and thus gives her gratification. This borders on with the pornography and leaved you with a deep disgust. I only may ask why such a talented director made such a bad and senseless work?",

As children, the three grew up as close friends, with young Merle desperately in love with Freddie. Once they grow up, of course, hormones kick in and both men fall in love with their younger playmate. Then, with WWI breaking out, Merle makes the choice to follow her heart, but with unforeseen consequences. . .\n\nMy mom always roots for Herbert Marshall&apos;s character when she watches this movie, but I think it&apos;s just because she&apos;s partial to him in other movies. There&apos;s nothing wrong with Fredric March&apos;s character, and it really does feel like he loves Merle just as much as Bart. But, just in case you prefer Bart, you&apos;ll be in good company. \n\nPersonally, I like Enchantment and the 1978 version of Four Feathers better, but there are some cute moments. It gets a little far fetched towards the end, but isn&apos;t that what old movies are for? A little tears, a little romance, and a little melodrama over a wartime setting. If you agree, check out this classic.",

      "reviewBody": "How to approach beautiful, crazy Zen in a way that makes sense to us in the West? In a way that it, and this film, can actually inform us.\n\nThis problem, one of translation, was inherited by cinema. China conceived this poetry where humane dispassion is passionately sung about, where a flower looks back at us looking at it, but we know of Zen from Japan, us here most likely from their cinema. Perhaps even without knowing it.\n\nBut when the most fascinating form to express it in came along, so did Mao. Japan shouldered the task to do what the Chinese couldn&apos;t, with their affinity for broken symmetries and abstraction cultivated in the tea room, but even here we concede to a certain unfamiliarity that keeps these things at a distance. Teshigahara makes some general sense to us, but he&apos;s not really opened until we learn about ikebana.\n\nHow to bridge the rift then? Which is bigger than we think because we have the words, &apos;emptiness&apos;, &apos;desire&apos;, &apos;self&apos;, but mean by them wholly different things than the Buddhist.\n\nWhich is to say; having been brought up in a culture that distinguishes between the omnipresent creator who created something out of nothing and us as creatures separately placed in that world to atone for an original, ancestral sin (which means that the world itself is the punishment), or still swears by Descartes&apos; old stratagem that we are because we think, how can we begin to wrap our heads around notions of emptiness as actually soothing? What are we to make of Zen poems that speak of death, which so terrifies us, as merely the echoes of bamboo flutes returning to the bamboo forest? \n\nWhen Zen Master Ikkyu says that &quot;I&apos;d like to offer something to help you; but in Zen, we don&apos;t have a single thing&quot;, take his word for it. He&apos;s being a bit of a smartass, but that&apos;s because he wants you to listen for a moment. Which is to say that if we come to this looking for something, a taste of Zen that will guide us home, we&apos;ll likely have to struggle to stay awake long enough to realize that there is nothing to be offered.\n\nMore precisely, nothing to be taught. But if we become aware instead? If we come to embody what the film does? We are related with various aspects of the teachings here, how ego and desire bind us, how in stillness of mind we can free ourselves of those bonds. The illusionary burden of duality. But as the young monk meditates, a cow breaks free of her captivity. So what to do?\n\nDown in the city, the monk offers up his alms&apos; bowl in the middle of the busy marketplace. This is where stillness of mind attains proper meaning, in the sound and fury. \n\nBut again, if the film has few words to impart, and it does, like a visual mantra which in repetition calls for us to concentrate on the texture of the sound itself, what are we to take from it? Perhaps a few pointers to wisdom, mere signposts on the road.\n\nMost importantly, meditational absorption (the actual Chan/Zen). Again we may be troubled by our inclination to regard images here as symbolic, as meaning something else, a flying crow or a cow leading a boy, when things are actually simpler; which is the most complex they can be. This is not a mystical work, things here mean what they are. If it is difficult to come to terms with this, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve been so accustomed to grasp &apos;flower&apos; by what stored ideas we have of &apos;flower&apos;. Descartes again.\n\nBut to depart is to arrive, as the dying Zen master says. To send the mind out is to see it come back again. Isn&apos;t that cool? So how to depart from established notions? How to look at the flower as it looks back at us, to actually do this? \n\nOne of the great contributions of Zen to this conundrum is the koan, the enigmatic phrase whose purpose is to tie our tongue so that we may reflect in silence. There is a koan asked of the novice in this, which points towards the kensho, the awakening of the true self. The title of the film is another. Life is the most complex; how to gather all the different notes we can feel played out in us into a single harmonious music? And how to play that music, actively, joyfully, as it plays us? \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to these, other than what we embody through our experience. Embodying this is enough. And by this I don&apos;t mean a fancier version of being &apos;mesmerized&apos;. I mean be one with it, like the calligrapher becomes one with his brush, the haiku poet with his blank paper. Hear what is said, then be quiet as the question answers itself.\n\nSomething to meditate upon."

I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What&apos;s up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?",

      "reviewBody": "I have watched my fair share of Post-Apocalyptic movies and I thought I would probably like this one but it honestly didn&apos;t really grab me in a big way.\n\nWhen the movie starts up and it said Directed by Franky Schaeffer, I remembered I had seen a movie by him yonks ago, &apos;Booby Trap&apos; I think it was, which was another PA movie but if my memory serves I don&apos;t think it was as jokey as Rising Storm is. To set the tone of RS it starts out kind of like a parody of the opening sequence of Blues Brothers, with the character that is played by Galligan collecting his brother from Prison upon his release...it even makes the joke about the absence of the nice car they used to own. \n\nAs the movie slowly progresses we learn about the wastes being governed by a Televangelist, which is a unique plot point but doesn&apos;t add anything interesting to the movie. The brothers set off on their adventure, get up to some low-brow high-jinx and eventually meet up with two women whom end up becoming their companions. Will they bring down the dictatorship? Will they live to eat McDonald&apos;s again? Will Bill Katt make a small but significant appearance more than once? You have to watch to find out...but I thought this was really a bit drab, only half the jokes seemed to work and even then they were very mild. If you are still interested then by all means, head into the wastes for the VHS!"

Not that &quot;Scandal&quot; is in any way hypocritical; I mean what&apos;s the point of making a film that&apos;s largely about sex if you leave out the sex!\n\nJohn Hurt is a superb Stephen Ward. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is perfectly cast as Christine Keeler, Ian McKellen, with a largely bald wig, is an unusually sympathetic Profumo and Bridget Fonda is great fun, and Golden Globe nominated, as Mandy Rice-Davies while the story itself is one of those juicy, gossipy affairs we never tire of hearing about. Throw in a great sixties soundtrack and a Pet Shop Boys/Dusty Springfield closing number and you really can&apos;t miss.",

And this movie right here goes extremely silly in many cases, which seems to have alienated a lot of the main protagonists fans. His fan base should be used to the brand humor, but it seems many did expect something different from this outing.\n\nI don&apos;t think the movie is nearly as bad as many have made it or anywhere as bad as it was received financially. There&apos;s quite a lot of good jokes in this, but again they obviously didn&apos;t work with the big crowd. I had other issues, especially with Michael Herbig. He doesn&apos;t seem able to shake off his TV past. It still seems from time to time that he tries to look into the camera. Still if that&apos;s the only criticism you have of course, that shouldn&apos;t block your viewing pleasure. Especially because he surrounded himself with a great cast. Not his best effort, but way better than you might expect",

They are holding off until they can grab everyone, so Craig has to continue the impersonation. However, the bad guys have a plant in the Surete.\n\nI&apos;s a nice spies-vs-crooks thriller, with an able cast that includes Brenda de Banzies, David Kousof, Gerard Oury, and Eric Pohlmann, running from Paris to Marseilles. Of course it&apos;s almost all shot on sets, with a few stock photos to lend that ambience so desired by big movie concerns. Guy Green directs with an eye owards thrills more than character exposition, and the ultimate solution is not what I expected, which is a good thing in the murky world of the CIA.",

      "reviewBody": "James Riddle Hoffa was probably one of the most enigmatic union leaders in this history of our country. As an important labor organizer during the over the road trucker strikes in the 1930s, he accomplished many things that made possible the emergence of the Teamsters Union as a major political force for several decades afterward. At the same time, he fell into a trap that bedevils many a fighter who perceives her/himself as a &quot;people&apos;s champion&quot;- he convinced himself that he had to fight fire with fire, and in the end, it devoured him. Secondly, Hoffa did not have the money, the support or the political sophistication of a Robert Kennedy. This&apos;ll finish you in the United States. Despite all our bombast about law and order, the country loves its shady political characters charming and slick, or the medicine show man, witness: Clinton, Reagan, Bush. The awkward and openly coarse need not apply, witness Nixon, Hoffa, Lott. David Mamet understands that, and that&apos;s why his version of Hoffa&apos;s life works. \n\nMamet&apos;s Hoffa knows the Kennedy family built their fortune out of rum running to a large extent, and he sees no difference between their corruption and his own compromises. At least, Hoffa tells himself, his own deals with the devil serve something larger then his immediate family, they serve the membership of the union. And this was very true, which is why a fair number of Teamsters still swear by the name Jimmy Hoffa. Nicholson&apos;s snide asides to his &quot;betters&quot; completely captures the class war basis that motivated the actual man&apos;s actions. Anyone who has been through an actual labor dispute and has been witness to the patronizing communications that come through a company eager to crush a union effort knows full well what fired up Jimmy Hoffa, even as we turn aside from the path he took.\n\nThe film succeeds because De Vito, Nicholson and Mamet understand what pushed the labor movement forward, and they understand its contradictions. Most important, they understand why those contradictions overwhelmed a man as gifted as Jimmy Hoffa, and this is what makes it better then your average Hollywood drama about labor. Hoffa is a film about working class attitude that gets beneath the usual dismissals of working class concerns, and as such, deserves respect. The powers that be have every legend about their leadership. It&apos;s time the working class was allowed legends about its own once again, provided we understand that they are legends, and therefore laden with much myth. The very real larger then life qualities of Jimmy Hoffa, however, make this a film worth more then one critical glance."

Typical of director Joffe, the film peers deep into the character of Vatel, around whom swirl politicking and wickedness, with such depth and dimension as to make the plot of secondary importance. Replete with sumptuous sets, elegant costuming, and epicurean delights, the film fills the eye and whets the palate as few films can while it paints a portrait of a sensitive and honorable man who makes the supreme sacrifice for dignity.\n\nA superb watch for those into period films painted with delicate brush strokes and subtle nuances.",

      "reviewBody": "Back in the early 70&apos;s, when his name wasn&apos;t yet a synonym for insufferably crappy hand-held camera horror stuff, Ulli Lommel actually was quite the promising and visionary young (barely 29 years old) director in his home country Germany. The powerful impact of &quot;The Tenderness of Wolves&quot; alone is already more than enough evidence to back up this statement. This is a thoroughly unsettling and disturbing drama/horror hybrid based on the true facts in the case of one of the most notorious European criminal figures of the previous century. Fritz Haarmann was a German pedophile and serial killer of young adolescent males during the Interbellum period and made nearly 30 victims in only five years of time. Haarmann makes his money by trades food and goods on the black market that he himself falsely confiscated by pretending to be a policeman. This is also how he picks up young lads in the train station and lures them to his apartment loft. Uncle Fritz probes for homeless boys and eventually murders them by biting their throats; which gave him the nickname &quot;The Vampire of Hanover&quot;. The atrocities became even more inhuman when Fritz, together with his lover/partner-in-crime Hans Grans, sold the hacked up flesh of the victims on the black market. &quot;The Tenderness of Wolves&quot; is definitely not an overly graphical or tasteless film, but the subject matter is sickening and the whole portrayal of pedophilia is beyond disturbing. Haarmann pretty openly declares his affection for young boys and his entire surrounding either deliberately ignores this or even considers it to be the most common thing in the world. Only his neighbor from the apartment below suspects his psychopathic tendencies and attempts to alert the authorities, but that fails as Haarmann actually had connections with the police where he worked as a &quot;rat&quot;.\n\nThe sequences in which Haarmann is intimate with his victims are extremely discomforting, but at the same time they make the film all the more powerful and hauntingly realistic. It seems unthinkable in this modern day and age, but it was so easy for twisted perverts to pick up unsuspecting and youthful victims. Especially in times of poverty and despair, like the case in Germany between the two World Wars. Every time Haarmann comes near a boy, you can already assume the poor kid&apos;s fate is sealed, like the runaway drifter at the railway station or the boy at the carnival. Whenever he approaches a kid, your skin is guaranteed to crawl, because his voice is so stern and despicable. &quot;The Tenderness of Wolves&quot; also benefices from a more than decent re-creation of the depressing era and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì the incredibly brilliant and courageous performance of lead actor/writer Kurt Raab. He truly depicts Fritz Haarmann exactly like an emotionless and depraved monster ought to be depicted. This certainly isn&apos;t a film that is suitable for all tastes (and even the most hardened cult fanatics need to feel in a certain state of mind to watch it), but it&apos;s undeniably a unique experience and easily one of the top five most unpleasant yet fascinating things I ever watched. Moreover, after witnessing the unforgettable tour-de-force accomplishment that is &quot;The Tenderness of Wolves&quot;, it&apos;s all the more difficult to accept that Ulli Lommel is nowadays directing junk entitled &quot;Zombie Nation&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Cannibal&quot; or &quot;BTK Killer&quot;.",

And despite I do get some laugh I did quite enjoy it as much as I could.\n\nBrief: Ed the lonely man was dump a year earlier and never was able to get over it; and now his boss gives him an ultimatum - if he could not come up with brilliant ad campaign his ass is history. He was given the time of two day to do so unfortunately his brother have other agenda for him this weekend, to get Ed to finally get laid and move on.\n\nOkay, I didn&apos;t find the film to be terrible or anything but I wish they should have polish the script a little more and add something new to the movie of this type. The story is same old as one would have known. The good thing about the movie is real life footages, which help the movie in great way with originality and humor.\n\nThe casting of the movie seem to be the best part of the movie with Brendan Fehr as little loser kind of brother and Chris Klein as a womanizer elder brother, both of them give a fairly good acting but it seem Chris might have gone over board with his enthusiasm. And the women in the movie aren&apos;t that bad looking.\n\nAdvise: If you do not like toilet humor, I wouldn&apos;t advise you to see it. And if you do, you probably know that these movies mostly involve sex and nothing else, therefore I will not talk about how were the directing, lighting, and cinematography etc. Just tried to relax and enjoy the movie lightly.\n\nReason To Watch: Series of Real Life Footage, Brendan Make Pretty Convincing Loser.\n\nReason Not To: Not As Funny As It Suppose To Be, The Story Ain&apos;t That Good.\n\nRecommendation: Yes, But Only Worth Enough For If It On Cable Itself.\n\nRating: 5.5/10 (Grade: D+).\n\nRate Y/N After Read.",

While the 1st part was refreshing and suspenseful, the following one was repetitive and went over the top. What about &quot;Final Destination 3&quot;? It&apos;s a some kind of combination of two previous installments. In the film seriousness coexists with comedy, while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy, most of all, stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like &quot;death will never defeat me&quot; and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus, the film is intentionally laughable at times. What&apos;s more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides, the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That&apos;s it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up, this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.",

      "reviewBody": "I have seen The Amazing Colossal Man several times and is one of Mr BIG&apos;s better movies.\n\nAs a plane crashes just before an atomic test at Camp Desert Rock, Glenn Manning goes to see if there are any survivors despite the danger. The bomb goes off and he gets caught right in the middle of the blast. He suffers 90% burns but doctors are very baffled when they take his bandages off to find him without any scars at all. Gradually, he increases in size and eventually, he goes on the rampage through Las Vagas and kills Major Lindstrom when he injects him with a formula to reduce him in size with the needle. Manning is shot by the Military and falls into the Colorado River but is not dead...\n\nOne of the better parts of the movie is where Manning kills the Major with the needle he was going to inject him with.\n\nThe cast includes Glenn Langan as Manning and 50&apos;s sci-fi regulars Cathy Downs (The She Creature), Russ Bender (It Conquered the World) and James Seay (Killers From Space). Most of the cast are used to fighting giant creatures looking at other sci-fi movies they were in at this time.\n\nDespite the low budget, this movie was fun to watch.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 5.",

      "reviewBody": "When I found &quot;Amelia 2.0&quot; I didn&apos;t even read the synopsis for the movie, nor did I know anything about the movie, I just picked it up and decided to give it a go.\n\nFirst of all, I must say that writer Rob Merritt definitely came up with a very interesting and entertaining story here. And better yet, it is a story which raises a lot of questions in the audience as you view it, in terms of your own views on the issues being dealt with throughout the movie. And for a movie to be able to raise that kind of questions, that is something that I find rather impressive.\n\nThe special effects and CGI effects in &quot;Amelia 2.0&quot; were quite good and really worked in favor of the movie. And for a Sci-Fi movie of this nature then having special effects is definitely a plus. If the movie had less impressive CGI, then the movie would have been much less enjoyable or convincing.\n\n&quot;Amelie 2.0&quot; has an ensemble of good acting talents, which were for the most part new faces to me. And I do enjoy watching new actors and actresses on the screen, as there are no associations to other previous characters linked to the performers. So that was a definite plus in my book. The actors and actresses in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, and that was working well in favor of the movie.\n\nDirector Adam Orton did a great job in bringing writer Rob Merritt&apos;s story to life on the screen.\n\nThe characters in the movie are quite well-rounded and they have very distinct personalities and traits. And the dialogue throughout the course of the movie was well written and delivered by the various actors and actresses.\n\nThe movie makes use of way too many short shots of random and pointless images that serves absolutely no purpose to the movie, aside from being fillers. That was particularly true for the first 10-15 minutes of the movie.\n\nI really enjoyed how this movie raises some issues and questions about humanity, the ability to replace the body in parts or as a whole, and how the soul fits into all of this if you take a religious stand on it. But also how traditional and inbred thinking stands in the way of technological advancement and the fear of embracing new and innovating things that break up with how things traditionally are and have been for a long, long time.\n\nI have a feeling that this movie might be very underrated and slip under most people&apos;s radar. However, I can most strongly recommend that you take the time to sit down to watch &quot;Amelia 2.0&quot; if you have the chance.\n\nThe ending of the movie was not really one that did the movie or the storyline much justice, and it felt just like it was a very, very wrong way to end the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Legendary comedy duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello play sidewalk salesmen / con artists Slicker Smith and Herbie Brown, who get into trouble with the law. To avoid being arrested, they cut into a line which they think is for a movie showing. Surprise, surprise...they&apos;re now on their way to enlist in the Army! Resigning themselves to their fate, they get another surprise when the cop who tried to arrest them, Michael Collins (Nat Pendleton), turns out to be their drill sergeant!\n\nBud &amp; Lou earned this initial feature film vehicle for Universal due to their success on radio, and they really make the most of it. These guys really were naturals at their craft, and perform their material breathlessly. In order to get things to feature length, some time is devoted to musical numbers - especially by The Andrews Sisters - and a major subplot about spoiled rich boy Randolph Parker III (Lee Bowman) butting heads with his former employee Bob Martin (Alan Curtis) while they both aggressively pursue camp hostess Judy Gray (the very lovely Jane Frazee). But the movie is never more entertaining than when Bud &amp; Lou are on screen. Some real hilarity comes from the way that they frustrate Collins with their antics; there are inspired moments of silliness. Bud is also a joy as he keeps devising ways to get Lou into trouble - note his ingenious method of helping Lou shed one pound so Lou can meet the maximum weight requirement.\n\nLively and engaging, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; is directed with brio by Arthur Lubin, features some catchy music (&quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;), and wraps up in a traditional &quot;misfits make good&quot; manner. The supporting cast also includes folks like Samuel S. Hinds, Harry Strang, Nella Walker, Carleton Young, Tom Tyler, and Shemp Howard. It&apos;s good fun, and paved the way for further Bud &amp; Lou big screen adventures.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "name": "An indecent review",
      "reviewBody": "In the late fifties a large industrial complex was built near Schwedt, in the GDR. This low budget film tells about the voluntary participation of the brigades of the Freie Deutsche Jugend in the building up, and as such belongs to the so-called Aufbau films. The FDJ was an organization similar to the YMCA, so the youth affiliate of there the Bolshevist Party. The boys and girls are strongly motivated to build a new socialist society, but they lack the skills and knowledge. This is remedied by Tomas Breitsprecher (played by the famous actor Manfred Krug, who was also a jazz player), an experienced civil engineer. However, Tom is not really a textbook character, and in particular has a bad reputation with women. Besides, he has never joined the party. Nevertheless, the construction proceeds rapidly, even though a bush fire temporarily has a devastating effect. Tomas has several collisions with Sigrit, the local FDJ secretary (played by Christel Bodenstein, apparently also a well-known actress), but this soon turns into a love affair. It becomes clear that the early marriage of Sigrit with another party member has been a mistake. The romance between Tom and Grit unfolds rather secretly in the fields and in an attic room. However they ascertain their mutual dedication, and it seems sincere. Since the film ends together with the summer, the final outcome of the affair remains unknown to the viewer. Marriage was by no means sacrosanct in the GDR. A large part of the film is devoted to the dialogs between Tom and Grit, in short phrases (Do you love your man? Yes. Does he love you? Yes. Doe you have children? No. Do you love your man? :silence:). I guess the texts merit a careful analysis, which I have unfortunately omitted up till now. For me the intriguing part of the film is the sketch of the party life in those first GDR years, since it shows the attitude that the state tried to promote among their people. Already the Soviet Union had its Subbotniks, workers doing voluntary overtime. In the Bolshevist philosophy, he workers should be willing to exploit themselves, and would experience their work as a fulfillment, or at least a dire need. Interestingly the rubble women in the GDR, who cleaned up the debris caused by the allied bombardments, did their job unpaid. On the other hand, the women in the FRG (western Germany) were recompensed for the same work. At first sight, the voluntary activity seems sympathetic. On closer examination, it can hardly have been really voluntary, and was based on social pressure, or at best on manipulation. In addition, volunteers seldom act in a professional and efficient manner. In the end, it is probably best to give any decent work performed a fair pay. With this bold remark I end my rather indecent review.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;They Wanted Her Body... To Save The World!&quot;\n\nAIP is a company that produced a treasure trove of low budget direct-to-video films that specialized in action movies, as the company name implies. Being a low-budget production company, you would think they would have been familiar with their forebear &quot;American International Pictures&quot; the original AIP. Why they used that name is a bit puzzling. Even though they made other types of genre movies, it was with action that they hit their stride. Although they ceased production in 1994, they left behind a legacy of VHS gems such as: &quot;White Fury&quot;, &quot;Kick Or Die&quot; , and &quot;Shredder Orpheus&quot; (Maybe they weren&apos;t all gems) Reviews for those three will be forthcoming.\n\nIf you are watching &quot;Alien Seed&quot;, there are three possibilities: 1. You are obsessed with aliens and have seen every other movie or TV show dealing with aliens ever made.\n\n2. You are obsessed with AIP movies and have seen every single one ever made.\n\n3. You are an Erik Estrada fanatic. There is no other reason you should have any interest in this direct to video cinematic sludge.\n\nTrying to ride the coattails of other popular alien flicks such as &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Demon Seed&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;E.T&quot;, while borrowing liberally from each one, the final product has the production value of the E.T. video game for Atari, which was subsequently buried in the Nevada desert, as all copies of this should be.\n\nThe plot: Apparently some broad was impregnated by the Alien Seed. In the movie this is referred to as an &quot;IBI&quot;. It was claimed this was a term used by Alien experts. That is highly doubtful. To pad out the running time there is a lot of chasing, shooting, and Erik Estradding around. It is not clear what is going on and to further pad out the running time on top of a pretty extensive pad job, there are several alien related dream sequences.\n\nThe acting is typical AIP acting, you know what you are in for. To the untrained eye, the acting may seem &quot;bad&quot;, but it is amateurish fun and you can&apos;t help but smile. Unfortunately, the film stock is shoddy, dingy and grimy looking, making it a tough sit for your vision.\n\n&quot;Alien Seed&quot; was directed by Bob James and it is his only directing credit to date. The writer Douglas K. Grimm was in the immortal AIP classic &quot;Elves&quot; with Dan Haggerty as &quot;Dead Santa&quot;. Additionally he directed the Traci Lords vehicle &quot;Laser Moon&quot;.\n\nThis desperately needed more Erik Estrada. It seems strange to say, but it is true. Estrada&apos;s portrayal of Dr. Stone, the villain of the piece, livens up the otherwise dreary proceedings.\n\nIf you have seen every episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Night Of The Wilding,&quot; and &quot;Twisted Justice&quot;, and need your fix of Estrada, watch this today!\n\nComeuppance Review by: Ty &amp; Brett \n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",

This is all about oddballs.\n\nThe good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.\n\nThe actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.\n\nThe bad. Since it&apos;s so bizarre, it won&apos;t please everyone.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don&apos;t think you&apos;ll see your run of the mill kind of film and you&apos;ll have fun.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Acid House&quot; is a series of three short stories penned by &quot;Trainspotting&quot; novelist Irvine Welsh, and true to his style, it is inspired by a terribly bad acid trip. Being a huge fan of Irvine Welsh, I had high hopes for this film, but I was also aware that it would most likely not be as good as Trainspotting. It wasn&apos;t, but a good movie all the same.\n\nThe first story is about a 23 year old soccer player who is booted out by his mates, gets kicked out of his parents house, looses his girlfriend, and looses his job all in the space of a few hours. After all this, he &quot;meets God&quot;. The second concerns a very disturbed couple with a newborn baby, and their wacky neighbor who moves into the flat above them. And the third, and best, of them is about a young man who is struck by lightning after taking a hit of acid and his soul is transfered into the body of a newborn baby. Very strange stories, only Irvine Welsh could have done these.\n\n As a movie, it has all the basic ingredients, save for a few dodgy dialogue bits here and there. All the actors involve give their best, and it was a pretty satisfying and mind boggling experience. It isn&apos;t as well laid out as &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, though, so people expecting a new &quot;Trainspotting&quot; might not get what they expect."

It&apos;s gets funnier every time he says a line.  One starts to wonder about the extremely low standards the girl must have in men.  Then there&apos;s an Australian croc hunter, loud and obnoxious, but with a tender side, blah blah blah.\n\nThe film moves along okay until the ending, which is not only utterly unbelievable, but anti-climactic as well.\n\nOverall, a somewhat below average creature feature, but the CGI was perhaps a bit better than usual.  I wouldn&apos;t exactly recommend it."

The latter is handled in a very early 20s European style reminiscent of the heady days of Maurice Tourneur.  The modern &quot;American&quot; sequences are too static, though, and the story is just a superficial melodrama that doesn&apos;t involve me too much.  Cary Grant plays his early character type from the Mae West films with far less interesting results.  One thing that is cool is that the club sequences give one an idea of what Dietrich&apos;s famous cabaret style might have been like.",

      "name": "The debut of AB&apos;s baby and Lolo&apos;s sis",
      "reviewBody": "After the success of Border (1997), J.P. Dutta came before the Indian audience with Refugee (2000) whose lead pair at that time was known as AB&apos;s baby (the offspring of Amitabh Bachchan) and Lolo&apos;s sis (the sister of Karisma Kapoor). J.P. Dutta had planned to launch Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s son, Abhishek through a movie - Aakhiri Mughal but due to certain reasons, he had to shelve that project for good and instead he introduced him alongwith Kareena Kapoor, the high-profile daughter of Randhir Kapoor and Babita and the younger sister of the top heroine (those days), Karisma Kapoor.\n\nAll things said and done, Refugee starts quite promisingly with the first encounter of the debutant hero and the debutant heroine with the illegal crossing of the Indo-Pak border at Bhuj (Rann of Kutch). The heroine belongs to a Muslim family coming from Bangladesh and can be categorized as the Bihari Muslims who had to migrate to the East Pakistan (later turned into Bangladesh) at the time of partition of India. The problems and woes of the Bihari Muslims are very pertinent because partition did not help them and to be frank, affected them quite adversely. Still the attitude of the Pakistanis towards them is negative and they look upon them in a derogatory way. Had the well-recognized director concentrated on this relevant issue, he would have made a much better and admirable movie. However he got confused between making a serious movie and a romantic movie. And it&apos;s this confused storyline of the movie which has made Mr. J.P. Dutta to fall flat on his face.\n\nThe hero who calls himself a refugee because he does not have any name except this identity and carry the job of helping the willing people cross the border illegally to earn money, falls in love with the teenager girl of the family whose marriage is the burning issue before the elders. The romantic track is definitely fascinating and the soul-soothing songs have made it all the more attractive and memorable. The dialogues of the movie (penned by J.P. Dutta&apos;s father, O.P. Dutta) are also praiseworthy in this regard. However the rest of the movie is studded with utterly illogical sequences and incidents. The action sequence seems to have been inserted in the movie quite superfluously.\n\nThe narrative and the treatment of the plot has a clear imprint of the movie-making style of J.P. Dutta. However it renders a lesson also to the prospective filmmakers that the narrator should be clear in his mind as to what he has to narrate and what should be the logical conclusion of his story. If he, himself , is not clear about what he wants to convey, how can his product become a good one ? The actors have done their parts quite well. Jackie Shroff and Sunil Shetty, being the BSF officials of India and Pakistan have done justice to their defectively crafted roles alongwith Sudesh Berry, Anupam Kher and Reena Roy. An actor of the calibre of Punit Issar has been wasted in an insignificant role. However the best performance is definitely of Kulbhushan Kharbanda, the head of the illegally migrated Bihari Muslim family. His dialogue - &apos;Bangladeshi Hona Koi Gunaah Hai Kya ?&apos; (Is it a sin to be a Bangladeshi ?) underscores the path which the movie should have followed to be a meaningful and purposeful one.\n\nNow for the young and fresh lead pair who was better known for its family background at that time - Abhishek Bachchan has done well in some scenes and is quite pathetic in some others, i.e., he has delivered a mixed bag of good and bad performances. On the other hand Kareena Kapoor is so natural as if she were born before a movie-camera. I rate her performance in this very first movie of her as her best till date (even better than that of her in Jab We Met).\n\nCinematography and technical aspects are up-to-the mark. However the unnecessarily intruded action scenes are not that impressive as in the other movies of J.P. Dutta. The length of the movie is also on the higher side. The climax is quite indigestible (Kareena giving birth to a child on the border) and looks ridiculous.\n\nMusic is the biggest asset of this movie. The team of Anu Malik and Javed Akhtar has done a memorable job and Anu Malik quite deservingly won the national award for the best music director for his work done for this movie. The song Panchhi Nadiya Pawan Ke Jhonke is, in my opinion, one of the best twenty Hindi movie songs of all times. The other songs - Aisa Lagta Hai, Taal Pe Jab Ye Zindgaani Chali, Raat Ki Hatheli Par Chaand Jagmagaata Hai, Mere Humsafar Mere Humsafar and Jise Tu Na Mila are also worth listening to again and again.\n\nI recommend this movie to all the fans of Kareena Kapoor and others too who are interested in watching a lovely love story blossomed on two different sides of the Indo-Pak border, alongwith memorable songs.",

Fonda and Bridges are both terrific, as usual, and the story of their meeting and falling in love along with the moral rebirth that love sparked in both would have made a fantastic movie.  Jeff Bridges is the USA&apos;s stealth great actor:  he quietly nails every role without an ounce of flash.  His chemistry with Jane Fonda (hell, he has chemistry with every actress he&apos;s ever costarred with) is the best reason to watch this.  Unfortunately, the heart of the plot is a lackluster murder/conspiracy story which undermines the rest.  It takes &quot;The Morning After&quot; from a &quot;must see&quot; to a &quot;see if there&apos;s nothing better.&quot;",

Realism obviously isn&apos;t to be expected.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: A bomb-sniffing dog is fired from the police force for a high profile mistake. That night Cad (Patrick Warburton) dognaps him, Cad works as a henchman for Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) a mad scientist, who injects him with an elixir. The dog escapes, but now has superpowers. He&apos;s adopted by Dan Unger (James Belushi) a security guard - an ex-cop, who&apos;s a widower with a moody teen son, Jack. While Barsinister and Cad plot to catch him and take over the city. \n\nDinklage hams it up and Warburton dumbs it down to amusing effect, while its always good to see James Belushi in screen. I watched it with my young son, and we both enjoyed it. He was the target audience, and I enjoyed it for what it was. \n\nI have seen much worse kids movies...",

      "reviewBody": "Joe D&apos;Amato approached Lucio Fulci and asked him to make a movie based on short story &quot;Porte del nulla&quot; Fulci himself wrote. Fulci made the movie and Joe D&apos;Amato then added some footage and edited and &quot;Le porte del silenzio&quot; or &quot;Door to Silence&quot; was finally finished. It&apos;s basically Fulci&apos;s attempt at making a psychological horror. Problem is, anyone with a little bit of functioning brain can understand what the idea of the movie is relatively quickly and after that we are left with mostly silent protagonist who drives a lot through the countryside encountering various problems that slow down his journey or make him confused and afraid. One would think that all those silent scenes are perfect for the main character to have many monologues or maybe think about what&apos;s happening to him and we as an audience can hear those thougts, you know, so the character gets at least a little bit character development, but no. Melvin is, simply put, a boring and unlikable main character. He&apos;s rich, arrogant and prone to getting himself into danger. He tries to cheat on his wife two times during the movie and he&apos;s just not interesting at all. And then, when you realize that you understood the whole point (or plot twist, if you will) of the movie (which isn&apos;t very original) before it even ended and that the main character is boring and that there aren&apos;t any hallmarks of Fulci&apos;s work like gore and nudity at least to give you something to look at, you conclude that the movie isn&apos;t really good. If anything the best thing in the movie are the nature shown and (sometimes) the music. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is not the worst movie ever and it&apos;s functional. It&apos;s refreshing to not receive the same thing from Fulci from time to time. But in the end, the movie is boring and I see no reason for you to watch it if you are not a Fulci fan. 5/10! I don&apos;t recommend it...",

      "reviewBody": "In 1849, in the Archipelago of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, the drunken Ariel Neel Auguste (Emir Kusturica) and his partner Louis Ollivier (Reynald Bouchard) kill for a futile motive (to see if he is fat or just big) the fishing boat captain Coupard (Michel Daigle). Nell, who stabbed the victim, is sentenced to die with his head severed in the guillotine while Louis is sentenced to hard labor. During the transportation to the prison under the custody of Captain Jean (Daniel Auteuil), there is an accident and Louis dies. While spending his days in the cell waiting for the guillotine and the executioner, Neel is invited by the captain&apos;s wife Mrs. Pauline (Juliette Binoche) to help her in her garden and becomes her prot√©g√©. Later he has a process of rehabilitation helping the locals in minor works and becomes very popular in the island. When he saves the building Caf√© du Nord and her owner from sinking in the sea, his popularity increases and nobody but the governor and politicians of the council wants his death. Neel marries Eleontine Jeanne-Marie, but sooner he is informed that the ship Marie Galante has just left Martinique bringing a guillotine. Now the Governor and politicians need to find an executioner in the population to execute the sentence.\n\n&quot;La Veuve de Saint-Pierre&quot; is a beautiful dramatization of a story of rehabilitation and intolerance. I do not know whether this event is partially true or not ‚Äì there are references in Internet to this story but in sites that I can not trust ‚Äì but this movie is wonderful. The story and screenplay are engaging and very well written with powerful lines; the direction of Patrice Leconte and the performances are top- notch, with Juliette Binoche extremely beautiful and elegant as usual and showing a magnificent chemistry with Daniel Auteuil; the cinematography and costumes are wonderful. Based on my adjectives, it is unnecessary to say that I loved this movie. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Vi√∫va de Saint-Pierre&quot; (&quot;The Widow of Saint-Pierre&quot;)",

John Malkovich does an admirable role and that is important for the link between viewer and the close universe. the fragility of the scenes. and the voice of Malkovich as its frame."

Paul and Charles travel to the countryside to the manor of Charles&apos; stepfather, the millionaire Th√©o Van Horn (Orson Welles) that is married with the young H√©l√®ne Van Horn (Marl√®ne Jobert). Paul is welcomed by the family and along the days, he learns that Charles and H√©l√®ne had a love affair, and Charles wrote love letters to H√©l√®ne. One day, Th√©o gave a party for two hundred people and the letters were stolen. Now they are blackmailed by the thief that demands a large amount to return the letters and Paul helps H√©l√®ne to pay the blackmailer. When the extortionist requests more money, Charles and H√©l√®ne forge a burglary, but the plan does not work well ending in a tragedy.\n\n&quot;La D√©cade Prodigieuse&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Ten Days&apos; Wonder&quot; is a slow-paced dramatic thriller by Claude Chabrol. The story based on the Ten Commandments is very well acted but unfortunately it is not difficult to foresee the twist since the number of characters is only five. This DVD has not been released in Brazil and I have just watched a DVD from Pathfinder Home Entertainment. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles and in some moments it is very difficult for a non-native in English understand the pronunciation of Orson Welles. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;10 Dias Fant√°sticos&quot; (&quot;10 Fantastic Days&quot;)\n\nNote: On 09 December 2024, I saw this film again.",

      "reviewBody": "Even in the greatest stories, there are chapters that aren&apos;t quite as strong as the rest. The Olsen Gang series is no exception. After three extraordinarily ingenious films in a row(and before that, &quot;...Runs Amok&quot;, which marked the start of the period of perfection for the franchise... I suppose this could be argued to mark the end of said period, but if my memory serves me right, the next film pulls the level up again), and one particularly amazing coup in the previous film, it was to be expected that the quality would fade somewhat. After a quite funny opening scene ending in a very memorable line, followed by a very unusual &quot;release scene&quot;, with some playful music and editing, the film never begets few laughs. And the bigger issue; the writing. Too many new things are thrown somewhat carelessly into the mix, and few of them work or are used properly. B√∏rge is sorely missed. Did we really need a new opposing gang? Or B√∏ffen made into a right-hand man with homemaker tendencies? The role of the ever-so-slightly dim hit-man with brutal methods fitted perfectly, for Ove Verner Hansen and the films. Let&apos;s face it, with the ineffective police force displayed in the series, we need a proper adversary for Egon. He is a criminal mastermind, after all. Bringing back Holm Hansen was good, but the man hardly had anything to do at all. Hallandsen was a joke and a far too easy victim. Federspiel&apos;s small character is quite good. Arthur Jensen&apos;s similar-sized role provides some of the greatest laughs. The idea of Kjeld having to do house-work seems mostly like a half-hearted attempt at playing with the briefing sequence, something that they did better in one of the previous films(I believe it was the seventh, &quot;...on the Track&quot;, but don&apos;t hold me to that). While some fun does come from it, the addition of Paul Hagen&apos;s character Mester Hansen could easily be done without. He&apos;s not used for anything, much like most other new characters. Claus Ryskj√¶r does garner some laughs as the neurotic computer-expert constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but he hardly adds anything. Some funny scenes and a memorable plan or two, including the one involving the Danish section of The World Bank(containing bits and machinery reminiscent of the works of the Dane Storm P.), but overall one that you can skip without missing too much. The car-chase reminds one of the earliest of the films of this series, and that&apos;s not what you want to be thinking of while enjoying these (later, better) films. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the franchise, those who insist on watching all of the films. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Seemingly modeled after DEAD OR ALIVE, starting off with a stylistical hodge podge of slow-mo gunfights and paranoid posturing and sizzling in the finale with a fair share of comic-book outrageousness, Rekka succeeds as a movie not for being ultraviolent or particularly graphic (it is neither by Miike standards - although still violent enough to raise a public outcry if it was the work of a mainstream American director), not because yakuza underlings get shot full of holes or Riki Takeuchi scowls like a bulldog as he shoots rocket launchers in the middle of crowded streets (DOA homage anyone?), not for the sound and fury, but for the moments in between. In that respect, Rekka is antithetical to DOA. Whereas DOA dragged through a drab and lifeless middle act to arrive at an exciting conclusion, Rekka sustains itself through moments of quietude and intimacy. In between the outbursts of violence, Miike gives us life as lived. Takeuchi&apos;s friend giving him advice on his hair dye. The glances between Takeuchi and his Korean girlfriend. The dingy eateries, night clubs and neon-lit streets - Miike prowling Fukasaku&apos;s stampin&apos; grounds half a century after the patriarch of the yakuza film first pictured a different kind of postwar Japan.\n\nIn the end, Rekka works so well as a movie because Miike restrains the child within him eager to shock and impress and embraces the dramatist who observes the small moments of life. The plot is mostly forgettable, something about the son of a yakuza boss going on a spree to avenge the death of his father while a gangland conspiracy festers behind and a war between the different fractions is about to break out, and Takeuchi in the leading role scowls a little too much for my liking. But overall, this is as good a yakuza flick as I&apos;ve seen from Miike, violent, funny, occasionally beautiful, imaginatively conceived but hastily executed (as with most Miike films), a thoroughbred Miike flick bearing all his trademarks, one aimed at both the heart and the gut. Not a masterpiece of any kind but a worthwhile movie."

The second movie is about how Alex saves the horse and gives it a purpose in the world with the help of Mickey Rooney.

      "reviewBody": "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!!!¬Öhaving read the book not only once, in German but also in French, I was impressed by this movie adaptation of the French classic novel by Guy de Maupassant (5 August 1850 ‚Äì 6 July 1893) . \n\nI must admit however, that the events happen very fast (it is very hard to pack such an intense and complex story into 160minutes) and it&apos;s mainly fully understandable to those who have actually read, loved, discussed and grasped the novel. The movie incorporates many swift innuendos and hints at passages taken directly from the novel. It is is very accurate to, and there are even scenes and dialogues straight from, the novel. The relevant essence of 19th century French society rules is obvious. And even though the director skips some of the specific historical and political details, the viewer gets indications and references to catch on. The actors/characters from the book, especially the ladies in question, couldn&apos;t be cast more perfectly Uma Thurman, the immaculate representation of Madeleine int he novel, Kristin Scott- Thomas, ditto as Virginie with her age, looks and temperament and Christina Ricci, down-to- earth, less intellectual but utterly sensual (maybe with a little exception of Ricci who played Clotilde&apos;s character perfectly, but should have been more voluptuous physically). \n\nRobert Pattinson impersonated the poor protagonist George Duroy, without name nor heritage, however street-smart and snobbish, yet still sensitive and compassionate arriviste George Duroy, just as I imagined so many years ago upon reading the book. You might despise or pity, but you will always love him in the meantime. Beautiful authentic settings, costumes and props and the soundtrack just gets under your the skin, courtesy of . If you still question Robert Pattison as an actor (which I did, but do no more) then at least you may praise the direction of Declan Donnellan &amp; Nick Ormerod¬Ö. for ¬Ö the movie is simply¬Övery good, VERY Good indeed...",

      "reviewBody": "Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.\n\nIs the movie still funny? Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fianc√©e&apos;s father. During a night of drinking with the &quot;Wolfpack&quot; (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fianc√©e&apos;s brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don&apos;t remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City. \n\nHangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didn&apos;t deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesn&apos;t help that Galifianakis doesn&apos;t have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples. \n\nTodd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of R-rated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire three-act structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him. \n\nBottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the original---except it&apos;s in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangover&apos;s appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know it&apos;s coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter. \n\ndiac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis",

      "reviewBody": "A self-indulgent yet enjoyable fantasy by Woody Allen, where he models his style after Fellini&apos;s &quot;8 1/2&quot;. Allen plays a world famous film star/director not unlike his real self, who&apos;s now approached a mid-life crisis and has tired of making &quot;funny movies&quot;. Though he&apos;s become embittered, he reluctantly agrees to be the guest of honor at a weekend celebration where the best of his films are going to be shown. While there he has to contend with sycophants, obnoxious autograph seekers, childhood flashbacks and different women on a surreal journey to self-realization. Woody received some hard knocks from fans and critics for making this type of highly personal movie, but I think it&apos;s very stylish and dream-like. Photographed in glorious black and white. *** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "In the independent drama &quot;Lightning Bug&quot;, Bret Harrison stars as Green Graves, a tormented dreamer whose only aspiration is to become a horror film makeup artist. Graves struggle to reach his goal is plagued by his unlucky mother, Jenny (Ashley Laurence) and his new highly abusive stepfather, Earl (Kevin Gage). But Graves does everything in his power to keep dreaming and to help that dream stay alive is his girlfriend and amateur actor, Angevin Duvet (Laura Prepon).\n\n&quot;Lighting Bug&quot; is a relentless drama about one boy&apos;s struggle to overcome his abusive surroundings. Everything from his alcoholic stepfather, hopeless mother and white trash surroundings are all key plot points to keep this boy in check. What is strange about this film is that it is being marketed as a horror film when really it&apos;s an unforgiving drama.\n\nThe best part of this film is the stalwart performance by Bret Harrison, who is a relative newcomer to film. He has so much emotion and personal depth in a lot of scenes. He is a great find. I will look forward to seeing more from this kid.\n\nI have always liked Ashley Laurence and her portrayal of a lost white-trash single mother is captivating and so unforgiving that I often forgot it was her.\n\nAnother thing I really liked was the film&apos;s original music from singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney. It brought so much extra flavor to the film.\n\nThe biggest problem with the film is that it never lets up. It is just so depressing and relentless the audience is never allowed to breathe or laugh. I also really got annoyed with the sub-plot involving Laura Prepon&apos;s character&apos;s mother. This is such a tedious subplot to create even more conflict for the boy. He gets enough at home.\n\nIf you happen to see this film, enjoy the performance of Bret Harrison but prepare for a very bumpy and dark ride. (3 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer (dwkish@shaw.ca) DVD Details: &quot;Lightning Bug&quot; will be released from Anchor Bay Home Entertainment on August 9. The DVD features 2 audio commentaries with director Robert Hall and one featuring Ashley Laurence and Laura Prepon. The DVD also includes a music video from Kevn Kinney and some deleted scenes. The DVD itself is smartly packaged and it is amazing how much extra stuff there is here for such an independent film.",

      "name": "RIN-TIN-TIN: The Dog That Made Warner Brothers Possible.",
      "reviewBody": "2023 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of Watner Brothers which today is one of the largest multimedia conglomerates with the ownership of an incredible back catalog of movies from companies that they have outlived (RKO, MGM, United Artists, Allied Artists to name a few of the better known ones). But it was a noble animal that first paid their bills and became the world&apos;s first canine superstar. There were dog stars before Rin-Tin-Tin such as Jean the Vitagraph dog, Shep the Thanhouser collie, and another German shepard named Strongheart but none became the worldwide phenomenon that Rinty did.\n\nThis Kino Lorber Blu-Ray continues their ongoing partnership with the Library of Congress in restoring and releasing silent movies to home video. It features the first Rin-Tin-Tin vehicle WHERE THE NORTH BEGINS from 1923 and then his very successful later feature CLASH OF THE WOLVES from 1925. It makes for an interesting contrast to see just how much success changed the style of the Rinty movies. Most people prefer the later, flashier CLASH OF THE WOLVES but I found WHERE THE NORTH BEGINS far more engaging. With its smaller budget and no name stars (not to mention the former&apos;s irritating comedy relief), NORTH tells its story simply and effectively.\n\nNORTH opens with an introductory title card that gives the back story of Rin-Tin-Tin. He is one of a group of puppies found on a World War I battlefield. A soldier named Lee Duncan kept two puppies, one male the other female, and named them Rin-Tin-Tin and Ninette after two French children&apos;s dolls. Nimette died on the way over to America but Rinty thrived and was trained by Duncan for dog shows. His remarkable ability to carry out a wide variety of commands got him noticed by a Hollywood agent who thought that he would compete well against other dog stars. He was signed to a contract and the rest is history.\n\nThe plot of NORTH is one that would be recycled many times in later Rin-Tin-Tin movies. It is inspired by Jack London&apos;s CALL OF THE WILD. A crate containing a puppy falls off a sled and is found by a pack of wolves. They raise it as one of them and once he grows up, he becomes their leader. We then meet the human characters: a Canadian trapper, his fiance&apos;, and the villainous trading post boss. He sends the trapper out to sell furs then has him ambushed and left for dead. He is found by Rinty and they form a bond as they make it back to the trading post. Rinty exposes the villains and he and the couple live happily ever after.\n\nIn CLASH OF THE WOLVES, Rinty is once again the leader of a wolfpack. Unlike NORTH which uses real wolves, this pack is mostly German shepherds. A fire forces the wolves into a Western town to find food. Rinty is injured on the way and is nursed back to health by a young Charles Farrell (2 years before 7th HEAVEN) who has discovered large deposits of borax. The town surveyor wants it for himself so he ambushes Farrell who is then rescued by Rinty. Together they expose the surveyor and all ends well. Farrell&apos;s girlfriend is played by June Marlowe (Miss Crabtree from the OUR GANG series) and the extremely unfunny comic relief is provided by &quot;Heine&quot; Conklin (no kidding).\n\nLike other releases in this Kino Classics / Library of Congress series, it&apos;s pretty much a bare bones affair with only a commentary by film historian Anthony Slide on CLASH OF THE WOLVES, the only bonus feature. Nevertheless the transfers are excellent with the prints looking quite remarkable considering their age. I&apos;m a little surprised that Warner Brothers didn&apos;t issue a special 100th anniversary commemorative edition to honor the canine star that made Al Jolson, Jimmy Cagney, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, 3D, and now BARBIE possible but then, most success stories don&apos;t want to acknowledge their humble origins...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic."

It seems that the bad prediction of Fatima in this movie seen in the cup of tea was really concerning you. You passed few months after acting in this movie in a so strange motorcycle accident. I saw this movie. This is not the best movie you could have done but somehow it is so much you. A racist defending the rights of every man and woman. A &quot;new rich&quot; defending all the &quot;old poor&quot;. A pacifist defending all activists. A fat man attempting to give food to most of hungry men (Restos du Coeur). I have never been able to understand exactly who you were Coluche. One thing is sure, you died too early and every one of your warnings has been verified to be correct. The politicians from all sides in most countries are as you described them when you were alive. You were so right to make fun of all of them. As I am writing this note, TV5 International in its show &quot;Envoye special&quot; is reporting about Darfour and its horrors... Coluche, may be you are better off wherever you are now. Thank you anyway.",

It has a nostalgic feel for fans of the show, but it looks rather simple. As for the acting, Max and Phoebe save the day. Colosso scenes are very entertaining and should definitely have been seen more on screen. Ms. Wong is quite funny and contributes to the laughs. Don&apos;t expect character development or a good plot. This is a production that will only please the followers of the series. A better script, effects etc. Could have made the movie a bit more interesting. Suitable for those who want to have a good time with their family and have some laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "The first half of That Certain Feeling is a gauzy, undramatic look at two people who pretty much just fall in love at first sight. The second half is the story of two people who love each other trying to forge their path in a world of harsher reality than either of them expected, filled with wonderful moments and touching scenes. It really is a tale of two halves with the first feeling like competent but unremarkable silent filmmaking and the second half feeling like highly accomplished and perceptive silent filmmaking. Freed from working under Harry Langdon and newly hired by Harry Cohn at Columbia, Frank Capra seemed to be showing that he was already capable of much more than managing a comedian&apos;s pratfalls.\n\nMolly (Viola Dana) is a poor widow with two children who dreams of marrying a millionaire. At the same time, Andy B. Charles Jr. (Ralph Graves), son of the restaurant magnate A. B. Charles Sr. (Burr McIntosh) who owns the ABC Restaurant chain, is living large on his father&apos;s dime and testing his patience for his wayward ways. Leaving her job one day of working at a cigar counter in a department story, Molly accidentally runs into Andy, discovers he&apos;s a millionaire in an amusing bit of business dealing with an open-top bus and Andy&apos;s car, and they are instantly smitten with each other, having a night out and quickly marrying.\n\nNow, this business takes the first half of the film, and it&apos;s pretty typically lightly amusing but never all that engaging. There&apos;s no dramatic tension behind anything, just a rich guy and a poor girl instantly falling for each other with the smallest of obstacles quickly overcome. Some of those obstacles are amusing (there&apos;s some business with a waiter that Andy tries to keep standing up to hide he and Molly kissing by manipulating the server with a cane), but it&apos;s ultimately just light and frothy entertainment without much bite or weight for about forty minutes (depending on the speed of the presentation, mine was slowed down).\n\nThe second half is far better, though, and I dare to call it kind of great. It all starts with Senior cutting Junior off completely because he&apos;s convinced that Molly is just a gold digger out for Junior&apos;s money. She tries to leave him as a favor to Junior, but Junior won&apos;t have it. They end up determined to make a life together, no matter how they have to manage it. See? There&apos;s dramatic stakes around this. They have a real obstacle, Senior&apos;s insistence on keeping them apart or at least away from his money, and they have to overcome their own poverty to build a life together. It&apos;s not groundbreaking storytelling, or anything, but it is solidly built storytelling.\n\nAfter some amusing business around Andy being completely unsuited for physical labor, he comes up with the idea of selling boxed lunches to his fellow workers, directly competing with his father&apos;s business. Molly ends up running it, and we get our first full dramatization of the American Dream from Frank Capra. It&apos;s all about a vision and hard work, providing a better product at a better price than your competitor and succeeding because of the combination of it all (and not one scene of filling out a business license for some reason). It&apos;s satisfying to watch, but it gets even better when Senior, trying to figure out why his thinly sliced ham restaurant business is in the opening stages of failing, shows up at the little sandwich factory.\n\nWe get bits of farce as Senior sees Junior but doesn&apos;t know that Molly is Junior&apos;s wife, thinking that Junior is just the place&apos;s bookkeeper, all while Junior helps Molly with negotiations from behind her glass door, playing with the conventions of silent cinema as Junior tries to get himself understood by his wife in assorted ways. I think my favorite is when he covers the words on boxes to send specific messages.\n\nIt&apos;s kind of amazing how satisfying the second half of That Certain Thing really is as the young couple triumph through their own gumption. Performances are all solid with Graves pretty much just charming his way through the film and Dana having the larger gamut of emotions to carry, which she handles well.\n\nThis Frank Capra character...I think he may go places in the movie business. If only he can get the first half of his next film to work better.",

Unfortunately, the film fails to carry the expectations.\n\nBadri (Allu Arjun) is trained by a warrior-saint Bhishma Narayan (Prakash Raj) to protect the temple Badrinath in Takshashila. All goes well till the charming young girl Alakananda (Tamanna) walks into the temple along with her grandfather. Her grandfather wants to save Alakananda from her Aunt (Aswini Kalsekar) who wants Alakananda to be married to her son. Alakananda had insulted her Aunt sometime for calling herself the wife of a Bellary-based factionist. Badri goes on to save Alakananda and at the same time Alakananda falls in love with Badri. Meanwhile, Bhishma Narayan wants Badri to succeed him but for that, he will have to remain a bachelor. Rest is how Badri and Alakananda unite.\n\nThe film stands on a weak story and adding further, the screenplay simply drags on and on. A few flaws to be noted in the screenplay, the way Alakananda falls in love with Badri is not at all convincing, the whole sequence of the fight with the naxalites was unnecessary, the end is too formulaic. First of all, what is this way of taking revenge? Marrying son to the person who insults her! It appears funny. Also, the songs pop-up without any situation favoring them. They try hard to remain on your lips on your way home but fail. The only fair composition are Nath Nath and Nacchavura. The dance by Allu Arjun is thoroughly enjoyable in the first-half but gets monotonous in the latter.\n\nThe production design is class. Cinematography is first-rate. The sets and locations are wonderful. Costumes are well designed. Choreography explores the dancing abilities of All Arjun to the fullest. Background score is superb. Sound design is top- notch. Also, the movie has a novel idea, obviously gone waste in an enterprise like this - a well composed English song (In the night) has been used in a Telugu film, probably the first film of its kind.\n\nComing to the performances. Allu Arjun holds a straight face throughout. Needs to improve. Fights are good and so is dancing but fails in acting. Tamanna has improved but still goes over the top at times. Prakash Raj gets limited scope but the make-up is good. Aswini Kalsekar is perfect. Post Johnny Gaddar, Phoonk, All the Best and Rakta Charitra, this is one film which will remain as a gem in her career. The actors who portray her husband and son are fair. The comedians are wasted, all of them. Only the one who accompanies Tamanna and her grandfather gets some scope. Rest are wasted. Grandfather is good.\n\nOn the whole, the film is likely to do good in the initial weeks, but business after that seems tough. Spend a few bucks for the wonderful cinematography, background music, locales and fights. Else, avoid it.",

And some navel-gazing by the director, who uses again the &quot;un homme et une femme&quot; title song.\n\nBut all is forgotten after you watched Villeret ,a gifted actor who disappeared too soon.",

Howard Hawks labours to create setting, mood and pace introducing genuine characters are colourful for the flaws they have as their positive points presenting heroes one can empathise with, people with three dimensions, not thin caricatures that popular many of today&apos;s movies.\n\nNo character empathises this more than Dean Martin&apos;s broken down drunk Dude. Nicknamed &quot;Borachon&quot; by the Mexicans (Borachon is Spanish for &quot;Drunkard&quot;) Dude battles with the demons that drove him to drink as he desperately tried not to let down Sheriff Chance, John Wayne, who believes in him more than he believes in himself.  Dude&apos;s pouring back of a glass of bourbon into the bottle is one of the most life affirming scenes ever committed to film.\n\nWayne never really does anything other than play John Wayne and Hawks spins on this playing with the ethos of the man.  The same steadfast values that mean Wayne&apos;s Sheriff John T. Chance will not release the prisoner Joe Burdette back to his murderous gang leave him stiff and awkward in front of Angie Dickinson&apos;s love interest &quot;Feathers&quot; creating perhaps the quintessential John Wayne movie in which the Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett&apos;s screenplay explores the depths of the ideals that Wayne stands for.  This is a movie about not just about redemption, but about the reasons for a tough redemption in a World in which collapse and lawlessness are easier options.\n\nAnd when Dude pours his Bourbon back, affirming that even though he cannot be the man he was but he can still be a good man, you will not be wishing it was film in bullettime."

      "name": "Kingfisher Elvis! He croons to the ladies, catches tuna, and cooks a good meal...",
      "reviewBody": "A bit odd, but generally pleasing, colorful Elvis Presley vehicle casts the singing star as a tuna fisherman who longs to buy his own sailboat; he takes a job as a nightclub entertainer (nearly usurping former-girlfriend Stella Stevens) and balks at women who want to buy him things in exchange for his affection (another poor guy with principles!). Stevens is a tough broad who looks like she&apos;s been around a bit, though she&apos;s still a better fit for Elvis over newcomer Laurel Goodwin, who twinkles like a bobby-soxer. Elvis actually shows great passion for Goodwin (kissing her in the rain, even speaking of marriage), but she just doesn&apos;t seem his type. Musically, Elvis goes International: singing Chinese, dancing a Spanish Tango, crooning Calypso. In the rock &apos;n roll opener, he sings, &quot;I&apos;m just a red-blooded boy and I can&apos;t stop thinking about girls&quot; (if he didn&apos;t like girls, what color would his blood be then?). The prettiest song, &quot;Mama&quot;, is sung not by Presley but rather The Four Amigos, while Stevens seems to do her cabaret act in between various arguments. Goodwin (secretly rich) takes a job in a hat-shop, but why--to prove she has principles too? The script makes no sense, and the hot-headed character conflicts are contrived, but Jeremy Slate is a convincingly wormy adversary for Elvis, and E.P.&apos;s performance is blithe and easy-to-take. **1/2 from ****",

      "name": "Sensitive and tragic love story , stunningly danced , concerning a woman is cursed by a bewitched love",
      "reviewBody": "This is the story of an Andalusian gypsy woman called Candela (La Polaca) living in Cadiz . It regards a haunted young girl being mysteriously harassed by his ex-lover and every night she goes to the place where his old lover died to dance with his ghost . It starts with a bloody confrontation between a violent man and a passionate gypsy , both of whom are dueling for the heart of the pretty young girl . As Diego S√°nchez (Rafael de C√≥rdoba) has dead in a razor fighting , although Candela affection goes on . The Diego&apos;s ghost is still obsessed with Candela&apos;s soul . After Diego&apos;s death at the hands of a contender falling by a cliff , but he continues to haunt Candela . Candela finally comes to realise that her ex-lover was unfaithful to her , and lives still . Thing go wrong when a fortune teller reads her the game cards and predicts tragic misfortunes . Meanwhile , a new suitor named Antonio (Antonio Gades ) ,falls really for Candela.\n\nIt is fundamentally a tragic melodrama with ballet scenes , that&apos;s why it is musically riveting , it is almost, also , perfect and laced with glimmer photography , particularly shown on the spectacular and sensitive dancing set pieces . It was a big success and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film , but lost to ¬®Jiri Menzel&apos;s Closely Observed Trains¬®. However, it won the &quot;National Syndicate of Spectacle, Spain&quot; award . This is the quintaessential Dance film features brilliant and frenetic choreography and embellished thanks to its chromatic aesthetic and a high-caliber Flamenco score , adding sensual re-creations of love , passion , betrayal , and jealousy . Freely based on ¬®El amor brujo¬® , as the film filled out the story with spoken dialogue , but nevertheless used the entire score of the ballet , along with additional songs and dances performed by characters in the film. El Amor Brujo (Love, the Magician, literally, Spell-bound Love or The Bewitched Love, sometimes translated as Wedded by Witchcraft) is a ballet composed in 1914-15 by Manuel de Falla to a libretto by Gregorio Mart√≠nez Sierra . In 1916, Falla arranged a rendition of the work for sextet and small orchestra and the following year he made a concert version, also for small orchestra . Later, he fashioned a piano suite from it and finally , a second ballet version (1925) that features expanded orchestration, elimination of the narration, small cuts and plot changes, and a different order to the numbers . The work is distinctively Andalusian in character with the songs in the Andalusian Spanish dialect of the Gypsies. The music contains moments of remarkable beauty and originality ; it includes the celebrated &quot;Danza ritual del fuego&quot; (Ritual Fire Dance), &quot;Canci√≥n del fuego fatuo&quot; (Song of Wildfire), and the &quot;Danza del terror&quot; (Dance of Terror) . As the entire location knows about the haunting , but still brands Candela as crazy because she dances every night with her husband&apos;s ghost (&quot;Danza del terror&quot;) . Candela, now a widow, is free to establish a relationship with Carmelo, but continues to be haunted by her husband&apos;s ghost . As Candela gets advice that a ritual dance is necessary to cast the ghost off (&quot;Danza ritual del fuego&quot;), but it does not work . The great trio starring formed by three spendid dancers : Antonio Gades , La Polaca, Rafael de C√≥rdoba are well accompanied by a fine support cast , such as : Nuria Torray , Morucha , Jos√© Manuel Mart√≠n , Fernando S√°nchez Polack and the famous cantaor and guitarrist Camar√≥n de la Isla .\n\nSpecial mention for the colorful cinematography by Francisco Mar√≠n and G√°bor Pog√°ny in Eastmancolor set on an elaborate on shanty locations- at gypsy slums , roofs and beaches- in which a lot of dancers dancing splendidly . This 1967 film was well directed by Francisco Rovira Beleta winning several nominations and awards as Academy Awards, USA 1968 Nominee Oscar Best Foreign Language Film ; Moscow International Film Festival 1967 Nominee Grand Prix : Francisco Rovira Beleta ; National Syndicate of Spectacle, Spain 1967 Winner Prize of the National Syndicate of Spectacle Best Film Rank: 1st place ; Premios ACE 1973 Winner Premio ACE Cinema - Best Actress La Polaca. Other film version are as follows : 1949 by Antonio Roman with Miguel Albaic√≠n , Elena Barrios , Manuel Dicenta ,Emilia Escudero , Ana Esmeralda , Pastora Imperio, Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠n , Arturo Mar√≠n . And the best rendition 1976 by Carlos Saura with Laura del Sol , Emma Penella , Cristina Hoyos , faithfully based on the ballet , starring and choreographed by Antonio Gades. It was the third in his trilogy of dance films, following Bodas de sangre (Blood Wedding) and Carmen.",

Of course the  writing is already on the wall when Vartan takes Lopez to meet his  crazed mom. No chemistry between Lopez and Vartan makes the whole  production fail early and by that time Fonda&apos;s over-the-top role (still  not quite sure why Fonda agreed to be in this movie) is not enough to  sustain the audience&apos;s interest. Fonda and Lopez end up behaving like  spoiled teen-aged girls who are each vying for Vartan&apos;s full attention.  Wanda Sykes is also along as Fonda&apos;s very annoying  assistant. Fonda deserves much better and the audience does too. 2.5  out of 5 stars."

Having read the original Russian novel and being a fan of Mel Brooks, I was curious how the two would come together. I was rather apprehensive, knowing how Russian literature usually suffers in translation, but hopeful that Brooks would somehow make something of it anyway. The film disappoints on both counts - there&apos;s precious little of the original in it, and Brooks isn&apos;t at his best here either. Moody is actually OK as Vorobyaninov, but the casting of Langella as Bender is just plain wrong, as he cannot possibly convey the depth and subtlety of the original character. Langella alone is enough to kill this film for anyone familiar with the book. None of the uproarious humor of the novel is anywhere to be found, while the few semi-funny visual gags are merely typical Brooks slapstick and have nothing to do with the source material. And even those aren&apos;t among Brooks&apos; best. However, having expected the worst, I wasn&apos;t exactly disappointed. An OK little comedy, if you don&apos;t expect too much. If you want more, read the book."

      "reviewBody": "The Man Who Fell To Earth is ultimately a frustrating film. The phrase &apos;the sum of its parts is greater than the whole&apos; definitely applies. At times it&apos;s brilliant and original, but it&apos;s effectively brought down by its overlong running time and relentlessly obtuse presentation. It begins very promisingly but falls away in the final third, where it just loses focus and direction. Visually, as can be expected from Nicolas Roeg, it&apos;s often quite excellent, with his usual bold editing techniques in place too. The cinematography is very good and David Bowie certainly looks the part. Roeg certainly had a thing for using singers in lead roles. He also utilized Mick Jagger in Performance and Art Garfunkel in Bad Timing, and Bowie like those other two is used to good effect. He doesn&apos;t really need to act very much; Bowie in the mid 70&apos;s was an almost alien-like creature to begin with. I thought Candy Clark was very good as Mary-Lou. She brought some warmth to the proceedings which was appreciated.\n\nLike Roeg&apos;s work in general, there is hardly any humour here. He was primarily a visionary auteur and The Man Who Fell To Earth is undoubtedly a work that allows him to express himself in a highly personal way. But unlike in Performance, Walkabout, Don&apos;t Look Now and even Bad Timing the technique never seemed to achieve an overall whole. My feeling is that I would need to re-watch this movie in order to develop a better appreciation of it. On first impressions, it&apos;s a collection of great moments within an impenetrable whole. A very strange film though.",

What carried the viewer through its predecessors (great retro design, music etc.) now isn&apos;t enough for a really good movie. The story itself could be summed up too quickly. The preparation for the big thievery starts almost from the beginning of the film and it&apos;s justification is really poor. What can be really enjoyed are the colorful visuals and a bunch of stars that seem to enjoy themselves. All this prevents a worse vote. To me it seems that Hollywood is running out on ideas at the moment. Sequels are obviously attractive from a financial point of view but bear the risk that they are produced and conceived not careful enough.",

But, in the end, everything is nicely bundled and the emotional resolution is accompanied by the satisfaction of knowing how all the principals fit together.\n\nThere may be a remake by Tarentino, but he&apos;ll be hard pressed to find a kid as cute as the one in this flick.

The World War Two epic has been done a thousand times, but this one is different. Michael Caine is his brilliant self, supported ably by Nigel Davenport and Nigel Green in this film which has drawn comparisons to the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; but, I believe, strikes ground of its own. Andre de Toth directs with a style that was well before its time, giving this film something others lack - longevity. A top flick worth seeing. *Three and a half stars*"

      "reviewBody": "After the Nazi&apos;s were driven out of France, those who had collaborated were mostly rounded up and punished ¬ñ many by death. However some escaped and were hidden, while others rose in power within the new regime. Pierre Brossard is one of the former and continues to live in fear, protected from those that would avenge his victims by his friends within the Catholic Church. However a close encounter shows that some group is closing in on him, meanwhile political pressure from Judge Livi and Colonel Roux&apos;s investigation into his whereabouts mean that he is quickly running out of friends willing to shelter him.\n\nIt is difficult to know how to approach this film because it itself doesn&apos;t seem too sure of what it is trying to do. Is it a drama looking at the idea of fleeing war criminals? Is it a chase movie? Is it a character piece looking at Brossard? It is never clear because it does do some elements of each but it doesn&apos;t really do anything that well and I, as a viewer, was a bit confused about what I was supposed to feel or think during it. The story itself is OK, reasonably engaging but not having anything of interest to it. As a chase film I was interested and the themes helped it seem more than the sum of its parts but not in reality. The motivations of the characters are never that well developed; the Livi/Roux parts are dull and quite routine although the sections with Brossard are more interesting.\n\nIt is a shame then that the film cannot decide what it wants to do with him ¬ñ do we feel for him, hate him or just watch him? The film doesn&apos;t let us decide this in a good way representing the complex nature of the character, but rather just doesn&apos;t push out any ideas one way or another. Caine does well despite this and gives a good character a bit of depth. He is where the film is although he probably benefits from the fact that everyone else is quite ordinary. Swinton and Northam are quite ordinary and their parts of the film just seem put of place and half-cooked. Support from Neville, Bates, Rampling and others just about do the job but add little.\n\nOverall this is an OK film but nothing at all more than that. Despite the interesting and complex potential the film just delivers an ordinary chase movie and fails to do anything with the ideas and concepts inherent in it. Caine does well to produce quite a convincing character but he is alone in that, with the material and the rest of the cast failing to do anything that interesting. Not bad but not worth trying to find because it is nowhere near as good as one would have hoped."

      "reviewBody": "Most of the Italian war flicks from the late 1960s and early 1970s were filled with action, adventure and familiar cliches. However, THE FIFTH DAY OF PEACE does just the opposite -- it&apos;s an antiwar drama with virtually no combat.\n\nIt&apos;s the beginning of May, 1945. Captain Miller (Richard Johnson) takes command of a POW camp in Holland. He must deal with Col. von Bleicher (Helmut Schneider), the senior German POW, who insists on maintaining a military system of discipline amongst the POWs. Soon, two deserters (Franco Nero and Larry Aubrey) are taken captive. Bleicher wants them shot for desertion; Miller could care less since the war is over.\n\nThe movie features a fine leading cast. Richard Johnson is excellent as the war-torn Canadian Captain. Helmut Schneider is equally great and very believable as the authoritarian German Colonel. Franco Nero&apos;s performance as an anti-Hitler, quick-to-anger deserter is incredibly good and quite over-the-top. It&apos;s a pity his voice was dubbed. In support is Larry Aubrey, who I have yet to see in another film. His performance as the innocent young German deserter is good, but doesn&apos;t hold a candle to Nero&apos;s. Bud Spencer is decent as the kindly Canadian Corporal Jelinek, but he only appears in a few scenes.\n\nThere is no combat in the entire film. The action takes place within the camp. There are no escape attempts; it&apos;s more psychological warfare between von Bleicher and Miller. The two deserters are just the catalysts. The film does a magnificent job of showing how innocent people are often the victims of circumstances beyond their control. The cinematography is marvelous; while practically the whole movie takes place within the camp, it&apos;s established quite early that&apos;s a muddy, dirty and horrible place to live. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is quite unusual and fits perfectly. The ending is unexpected and very well set up; at an appropriate moment, the story is simply over.\n\nThe DVD release is a waste of money. It is of poor quality and has no special features. I would recommend the video from Congress, although it&apos;s not much of an improvement.\n\nThe BEST Italian war movie I&apos;ve seen so far. I give it an 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Step Into Liquid is full of breathtaking cinematography of (mostly American) surfers achieving heroic feats of beauty in the lap of Neptune.  From the crazy Californians who boat 100 miles off shore to ride 60-foot waves breaking over an underwater mountain, to a paralyzed former surf phenom who manages to get back into the tide splashing near shore, to creative nutcases in south Texas who surf in the wake of oil supertankers in a 15-mile-wide canal, the movie offers a snapshot of the breadth of the sport as practiced in an endless number of ways wherever water, for whatever reason, forms waves.\n\nUnfortunately the movie is not edited with the same grace with which its subjects navigate the waves.  The director&apos;s ceaseless voiceover offers few opportunities for self-reflection during the film, and pounds the poetry into sentiment.  Music is used haphazardly and too frequently to add unneeded emphasis to the footage.  The use of &quot;white boy angst&quot; hard rock under much of the footage gives it the feeling of a cheap extreme sports video; all that&apos;s missing are the pseudo-MTV titles in the bottom-left corner to identify the Limp Biskit wannabees at the end of each scene. This film could have been great if it had been edited with a modicum of restraint, if the filmmakers had been content to let its themes be implied rather than stated over and over again in talking-head interviews and the voiceover.  By the end you feel like you&apos;ve watched a spectacular motivational seminar training film instead of a true drama.\n\n Nonetheless the movie is mostly enjoyable, and the subject itself is interesting, amazing, and often funny (the Green Bay Packer fans surfing in Lake Michigan off the shores of Milwaukee ought to have their own sitcom, and might if the right person sees the movie...).",

It is a great movie... enchanting... beautiful...it feels homely and intimate quite fast. The acting is good... especially of the director/actress Nadine Labaki.\n\nOne cannot avoid being seduced by this woman&apos;s eyes and beauty. Labaki is a stunner. She is so great in her role, best actress in the movie. Her character comes across very believably... and those eyes ! I recommend seeing this movie... and I&apos;d keep an eye on future projects from Director/Actress Nadine Labaki.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the title, this isn&apos;t yet another repellent documentary by the notorious film-makers behind MONDO CANE (1962) et al; rather, it&apos;s an adaptation ¬ñ their only &apos;proper&apos; feature as a team ¬ñ of the popular allegory &quot;Candide&quot; by the celebrated French author Voltaire. Incidentally, I own this classic piece of literature and, in fact, had read it some years ago; while I can&apos;t objectively determine the film&apos;s actual proximity to the source novel (also for reasons I&apos;ll get to later), as I lay watching it, I certainly recalled the episodic and essentially tasteless nature of the plot (placing the subject matter firmly down the film-makers&apos; alley!) ¬ñ not to mention connotations relating to the main characters (the naively optimistic hero Candide, his long-suffering lover Cunegonde ¬ñ serenely accepting every card dealt her by Fate ¬ñ and the boy&apos;s infuriatingly practical mentor Dr. Pangloss), and even key phrases from the book!! \n\nVoltaire&apos;s narrative thrust the titular character (after being banished for ravishing Cunegonde) into all the socio-political strife that went on in that particular era; in hindsight, little has changed throughout the centuries ¬ñ and, in fact, this satirical- picaresque style has influenced other notable works including Evelyn Waugh&apos;s &quot;Decline And Fall&quot; (filmed in 1968) and Lindsay Anderson&apos;s second &quot;Mick Travis&quot; adventure O LUCKY MAN! (1973). &quot;Candide&quot; itself has been adapted for cinema and TV a number of times, with perhaps the most interesting version being the 1960 French film (which updates the tale to WWII) with an all-star cast ¬ñ Jean-Pierre Cassel (as the hero), Daliah Lavi (Cunegonde), Pierre Brasseur (Pangloss), Michel Simon, Louis De Funes, Michel Serrault, etc. As for MONDO CANDIDO, it starts off in period vein but then switches to more recent times and events (presumably for a greater political immediacy) ¬ñ so that we see Candide &amp; Co. involved with IRA bombings, Jewish freedom-fighters, even hippies; that said, it maintains a curious balance throughout of old and new: for instance, at one point Cunegonde is raped by a rocker dressed in a knight&apos;s outfit(!) - which emerges to be perhaps the film&apos;s comic/absurd highlight. For this reason, the ever-reliable Riz Ortolani provides a suitably eclectic score.\n\nGiven its considerable length of 110 minutes (and with the only notable performers in the cast being Jacques Herlin as Pangloss and popular Italian comic Gianfranco D&apos;Angelo as Cunegonde&apos;s campy Baron father), it&apos;s small wonder that the film bogs down after the IRA scenes. Nevertheless, it features ample nudity and violence (notably the slow-motion massacre of the Jewish troops) ¬ñ to say nothing of weirdness ¬ñ to keep the interest alive (and is good-looking into the bargain).",

Its strengths are good characters who all play their parts in a story that does have you willing them on and on in their battle against the Nazi baddies, the unforgiving Sun and the relentless sand. Richard Attenborough is particularly excellent throughout, as is Percy Herbert when playing a solo part in one of the Fifties greatest short war scenes. If all directors were made to study this scene they could learn much, but what do I know! Thank goodness the film is still shown in black and white and this should always remain so. I liked this film so I say to all old fogeys and inquisitive but sensible youngsters just give it a watch and enjoy the film for what it is. The LRDG were incredibly brave men.",

      "reviewBody": "Not many film-goers may be aware of Portuguese director Teresa Prata&apos;s &quot;Sleepwalking land.&quot; A film that took Ms Prata 7 years to complete, it is yet to be extensively screened beyond the international film festival circuit. The movie is evidently Ms Prata&apos;s labor of love after she spotted a goldmine in Mia Couto&apos;s Portuguese novel &quot;Sleepwalking land&quot; published in 1992. The novel is now widely recognized as one of the finest literary works from and on Africa in recent years. Extracts translated into English that I read indicate a remarkable, powerful literary work, falling within the realm of magical realism. It was indeed a work screaming to be captured on celluloid with the help of special effects and convincing local acting talent. The young lady grabbed the opportunity to shoot the film in Mozambique and do the special effects in Portugal. Today her interesting movie adaptation is helping publicize Mia Couto&apos;s writing even further and is bringing global attention to both the Mozambican and the Portuguese cinema.\n\n&quot;Sleepwalking land.&quot; is one of the most interesting and realistic films on Africa. In the past two months, the film has won the international FIPRESCI award for the best film in competition at the recent Kerala film festival, and an award for best director at the lesser known Pune film festival.\n\nThe book &quot;Sleepwalking Land&quot; and film based on the novel are both set during the 15-year civil war that crippled Mozambique. Mia Cuoto has a gifted philosophical turn of phrase to describe the catastrophe of the war: &quot;what&apos;s already burnt can&apos;t burn again.&quot; The film (as in the book) looks back wistfully at the tragedy of the unrest through the eyes of a dreaming orphan boy and provides a glimmer of hope for the survivors of civil anarchy to cope with what is left to build anew. While Mia Cuoto and Teresa Prata focus on the social and economic plight of Mozambique, their respective works can equally mirror the problems of the continent.\n\nThe film follows a young orphaned Mozambican boy Muidinga (an endearing performance by an acting novice, Nick Lauro Teresa), who can fortunately read as he had once attended school and is even familiar with Melville&apos;s Moby Dick, and his unrelated, illiterate guardian, a wise old man called Tuahir (played by non-professional actor Aladino Jasse), tossed accidentally together by the civil war. The film and the book trace their common will to survive the difficult days. The young boy might have read. or rather heard, the story of Moby Dick, but the name is indelible in his memory. Director Teresa Prata, who adapted the story for cinema, therefore takes creative license, and allows the young boy to call his pet goat &quot;Mody (sic) Dick.&quot; (When I questioned the director on this detail, she stated that she was responsible for this change and that it was not part of Couto&apos;s book.)\n\nThe film and book have two parallel plots. The young boy and the old man, on the run in the bushes from marauding, gun-toting factions of the civil war, come across a charred bus with burnt corpses and their possessions that escaped the fire. Among the possessions of the dead passengers are notebooks that tell a story of a woman named Farida, a squatter on an abandoned ship, waiting for her young son to find her, and a hardworking young man Kindzu, who has fled his burning village that has faced the wrath of the civil war-mongers. In this discovered manuscript, Kindzu meets Farida. Subsequently, Kindzu goes searching for Farida&apos;s lost son. \n\nThe young boy narrates the tale to the illiterate old man, after reading the manuscript, and begins to associate Farida as his lost mother. He even imagines the name of the ship she is squatting on is called &quot;Mody (sic) Dick&quot; (again, Ms Prata&apos;s contribution to the story).\n\nThe parallel love story of Farida and Kindzu never takes center stage¬óthe backbone remains the dreams of the young boy under the guiding spirit of the wise old man. Between the two, the viewer of the film is introduced to the problems of Mozambique, of Africa, of any developing country. As in a Greek tragedy, you trudge along a path that gives you a notion of travel and progress, only to return to the same spot, literally and metaphorically. \n\nPretense and dreams make the film move along. To aid the young boy on his &quot;journey&quot; to his &quot;loving mother Farida&quot; squatting on &quot;Mody (sic) Dick,&quot; the old man devises the means to reach the sea (Indian Ocean) from the bushes of Mozambique. The old man digs a hole in the ground. Water sprouts and a stream forms. The stream becomes a river and at the end of the river there is the ocean. In the Ocean, the lead characters find the derelict &quot;Mody (sic) Dick&quot; with Farida on it. Obviously, if you demand conventional realism¬óthere is very little that the film can offer. If you accept magical realism as a tool to narrate a realistic socio-political scenario in Africa, both Mia Couto and Teresa Prata have much to offer and delight your senses. \n\nThe viewer gets a glimpse Couto&apos;s Mozambique. But among the ruins, Couto and Prata, show a glimmer of hope in the form of an orphan, representing the new generation, learning hard lessons of life in the bush. Ms Prata has made a fine effort to extract remarkable performances from non-professional actors and has proved her capability to adapt and direct an interesting work that would be interesting for any person interested in good African cinema. This film may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but a fine example of good African cinema by a gifted and persevering lady from another continent.\n\nThe description of a civil-war torn country itself as a sleepwalking land offers fodder for thought, beyond the usual images of violence, poverty and carnage that adorn the typical Africa cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Edward Albee&apos;s award winning play, Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ran for 664 performances on Broadway and just closed down when this film version made its debut in 1966. The Broadway play was set entirely in the living room of George and Martha&apos;s home and starred Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, Melinda Dillon, and George Grizzard. All eminently respectable players, but none of them exactly movie box office.\n\nThis film was destined to make money when the most publicized couple of the decade, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, chose it as a star vehicle for themselves. Of course what was not clear was how well a one stage play would adapt to film.\n\nIt adapted very well and went quite beyond one stage. The action of the film moved effortlessly to an all night diner at one point with some stops along the way. You&apos;d hardly know the story as originally told only had one setting.\n\nThere&apos;s no real plot to it. For reasons I can&apos;t fathom this middle aged and bitter couple George and Martha have a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over to their house at two in the morning. I don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;m usually not my best at that time. Also they had just come from a party at Martha&apos;s father&apos;s house. Martha&apos;s dad is the president of a college and George teaches there. Nick and Honey are a newly hired professor and his wife.\n\nThe late night and the liquor bring out the worst in everybody. A whole lot of ugly truths get told.\n\nWho&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the summit of the professional team of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Playing against type, Elizabeth Taylor got her second Oscar the one she felt she earned. She always disparaged the one received for Butterfield 8 as it came on the heels of her well publicized pneumonia bout.\n\nIn fact all four members of the cast were nominated with Sandy Dennis winning Best Supporting Actress. Ironically Richard Burton didn&apos;t win, losing to Paul Scofield for A Man for All Seasons. I guess the Academy voters figured Burton would get another shot. He never brought home the big prize though.\n\nGeorge Segal usually gets overlooked. This film and Ship of Fools was the start of his long career, but no Oscar for him either.\n\nWho&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf is quite the indictment against marriage, especially after the love has died. It&apos;s far from the whole story of marriage. There are many who stay married longer than George and Martha and happily. But it wasn&apos;t in Edward Albee&apos;s life experience to draw from. \n\nBut this should be seen to see Liz and Dick at their very best.",

      "reviewBody": "TCM presented a beautiful print of Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s Egyptian epic THE LOVES OF PHAROAH (1922). Released by Paramount in the US, the film was Lubitsch&apos;s last feature in his home country of Germany before setting up camp in Hollywood. (That&apos;s another story all together.) The &quot;Lubitsch Touch&quot; in his historically-based epics, such as CARMEN, MADAME DUBARRY, SUMURUN, or ANNA BOLEYN, is the director&apos;s ability to present us with the overwhelming sight of the plight of the crowd and then gradually direct our attention to a personal drama taking place within the epic sweep of time and destiny. (He does so more genuinely than DeMille, who seemed to have imitated this approach.) Then, of course,there are the sexual situations, the uncontrollable attractions, and the inevitable rejections that determine the fates of the characters, a theme continued into the director&apos;s sophisticated comedies and, later, witty musicals that followed this film. LOVES OF PHAROAH has stunning visual moments both large and small: the crowds working, revolting, being manipulated by rulers to the turning of Emil Jannings to a wall and dropping an outstretched hand, showing his reluctant realization of the futility of his affections. The film is deliberately paced but never draggy. Though there are moments of regret (the depiction of the Ethiopians is particularly stereotyped and inconsistent), this foray into Arabian exotica is a dramatic improvement over the stilted presentations seen in SUMURUN from a couple of years before. With THE LOVES OF PHAROAH, Lubitsch reaches the apex of his epic years (though THE PATRIOT may have reached greater heights, though we&apos;ll never know until a print is found).",

      "reviewBody": "The events took place during the First World War period. By the way, this story is biographical and tells us a bit of a life of the famous literary figure of the 20th century - Ernest Hemingway. In 1918, 18-year-old Hemingway had volunteered to fight in the war and during an attack in Italy, his leg was wounded a lot and he was taken to the hospital where he was lucky or not to meet 26-year-old nurse, Agnes and to fall in love with her. But did she feel the same? Good and even more bad things can be said about this film. And the plot with the costumes are one of the strongest points of the picture. Although there are many similar works, this looks different. Probably the fact that this very story is based on real events makes me worrying about the main characters, and all depicted atrocities of the war also make their contribution into perception. Some episodes will settle in my mind, for example, when a little girl called a nurse &quot;Angel&quot; or the man committed suicide, or those first signs of the love. I think any person will definitely find something to think about after watching the film.\n\nThough, the plot is fine, the majority of the film you would feel bored. The cause of it is a long beginning along with the actors&apos; play. Sandra Bullock played Agnes von Kurowsky and I really like her and have seen so many movies with her: &quot;The Proposal&quot;, &quot;The Lake House&quot;, &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; and the others. And in every film she was brilliant and bright and the one who made a great impression on me every time I saw her in the movies. But here she was plain and uninteresting. It seems that she tried to reserve her emotions and maybe she does not fit to this role. She looked sleepy and factitious. What about Chris O&apos;Donnell as Ernest &apos;Ernie&apos; Hemingway, he was not bad there, but not impressive and charismatic as I anticipated his character should have been. He was not energetic and sassy enough as he was trying to be and his playing just spoiled my impression on this film.\n\nTo conclude all mentioned above I want to say that this was OK: good because it was about the war and love and everything, but it was not impressive at all.",

Why is the ranking so low, because the martial arts is one of the best i&apos;ve seen in years. good story, lots of action, lots of fighting. what more could an audience want? it was a tough decision to give the right ranking for this movie. Although the actors performance was good, if they have put a jet-Li or chow yun fat in the leading role it would have been a world wide success. one thing i didn&apos;t like about it was, that it took place in the u.s. the return of this tyrant is supposed to be a 500 year old Asian myth. Why did this have to take place in the us &amp; why in the city of Chicago? The mix between Asians &amp; Americans didn&apos;t bother me that much, but i think an Asian cast would have been better. and one point deduction for the city of Chicago. it would have been way cooler if it took place somewhere in the orient.\n\nMy Final conclusion: Martial arts lovers &quot;go to the blockbuster closest to your home and go see this movie&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Manesh was looking gorgeous in this movie, but unfortunately it was a bit lame. I found the plot a little hard to catch on to, but it had some interesting twists. It was fast paced but I thought it was more exaggerated than the usual Telugu films - Telugu movies are already exaggerated (especially the fights), but this one was a little overboard, the hero had both too much intelligence and too much strength. And one thing I hate seeing in movies is then endings in which either the hero or the heroine (or in this case, both) is (are) badly injured but the couple starts to walk somewhere like their love is really enough to totally heal them physically. Kaizer mentioned that Amrita is about to die and she really looked like it, but then all of sudden she was fine when the story ended. That was the last drop of exaggeration for me. \n\nAs for the love story, it was a nice one. Amrita and Manesh looked sweet together. The songs were enjoyable.\n\nBut I wish I would have picked another movie instead of this one. Watch it at your own risk. You might feel your time was wasted.",

      "reviewBody": "Attempting to tread a fine line between two different types of film, Primeval is a misguided, but nonetheless kind of fun movie. On the one hand, it wants to be an &apos;issues&apos; movie, dealing with warlords, child soldiers and western apathy towards violence in central Africa. On the other, it also wants to have a massive great big crocodile running around trying to eat the guy from Prison Break. It&apos;s not bad, but while these two separate strands never really gel there&apos;s still some entertainment to be had. Provided of course you can look past the incredibly tasteless joke about the slave trade. \n\nThe film concentrates on Dominic Purcell&apos;s news journalist who gets sent off to Burundi to document the search for &apos;Gustave,&apos; a legendary croc who has chalked up over 300 human victims during his years prowling the river banks. He&apos;s accompanied by a British Steve Irwin a-like, Orlando Jones as the &quot;please don&apos;t get him&quot; cameraman, a slumming it Jurgen Prochnow, a token female and several dozen expendable locals and together, they trek into the bush to hunt Gustave down. They&apos;re also given a few warnings about &apos;Little Gustave,&apos; a vicious renegade soldier whose private army are responsible for all manner of atrocities in the region. But hey it&apos;ll be okay right? They&apos;ve got a machine gun strapped to the roof...\n\nNeedless to say, things go badly. There&apos;s all manner of carnage to be had as Gustave begins ripping people to shreds and trigger happy teenagers with AK-47s go on the warpath. By the time the credits roll, just as many people have been machine-gunned as eaten by Gustave and Purcell looks like he can&apos;t wait to get back to a nice, comfy cell in San Quentin where he only has to deal with corrupt guards and shankings every day. \n\nTaken simply as an old-fashioned adventure movie it&apos;s not bad and there&apos;s certainly fun to be had when the limbs start to get torn loose. The attempts at dealing with the bigger picture though fall flat. It&apos;s apparently &quot;inspired by true events,&quot; but aside from the fact there genuinely is a crocodile named Gustave in Burundi, that&apos;s about as far as the realism goes. Hotel Rwanda this ain&apos;t. However if you want a movie where a great big scaly beast eats people every ten minutes you can&apos;t go wrong. You&apos;ll have a hard time remembering any of the characters names when the time comes to type up the review though.",

      "reviewBody": "He did it again. And I don&apos;t even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don&apos;t even notice. That&apos;s how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we&apos;ve made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron&apos;s most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:\n\n~ The story is paper-thin.\n\n~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.\n\n~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.\n\n~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.\n\n~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.\n\n~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.\n\nAnd yet.....\n\nIT&apos;S SO DAMN COOL.\n\nThe world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It&apos;s stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it&apos;s damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it&apos;s real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It&apos;s like meeting with friends you haven&apos;t seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Salda√±a, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she&apos;s just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People&apos;s chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.\n\nBut the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri&apos;s children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The &quot;but one&quot;, however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I&apos;ve ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it&apos;s amazing. She&apos;s amazing, it&apos;s all amazing...\n\nDamn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",

      "reviewBody": "LES ENFANTS DE TIMPELBACH is a fantasy that offers an interesting premise; what would happen if children were so badly behaved that their parents decided to abandon them to their own devices? The film explores how the children adapt - or do not adapt - to their changed surroundings. It&apos;s a difficult task; they now have to undertake all those chores such as cooking, cleaning and tidying up, that hitherto they have always taken for granted. The film has its darker elements; there is an internecine conflict between the children strongly reminiscent of Golding&apos;s LORD OF THE FLIES. But the film ends good-heartedly with everyone restored and differences overcome. G√©rard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet enjoy themselves with a couple of lip-smackingly memorably performances, but the real stars of the film are the children themselves, a marvelous ensemble who seem totally at ease in front of the camera, giving the lie to the old adage that no one should dare to act with animals and children.",

      "reviewBody": "An uneven but mostly entertaining comedy/drama, &quot;Barbershop&quot; stars Ice Cube as Calvin, the owner of a neighborhood barbershop that has been passed down in his family through the generations. Of course, it&apos;s more than just a barbershop; it&apos;s a cornerstone, where you go to laugh with friends and find out what&apos;s happening in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t pay the bills, and Calvin, tired of barely scraping by, decides to sell the place to a local loan shark (Keith David).\n\nThe movie covers the events in and around the barbershop on the day Calvin sells it, changes his mind, and spends the rest of the day trying to get it back, along with several other sub-plots involving other characters in and around the shop (the most interesting being played by Cube and Cedric the Entertainer, both terrific actors).\n\nWhenever the movie stays in the barbershop, it&apos;s usually a lot of fun, with some good, entertaining dialogue and witty interplay between the many characters (both barbers and customers). However, the film frequently cuts to an annoying and mostly unfunny sub-plot about two bumbling crooks (Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate) trying to break into a stolen ATM machine. This is almost entirely unrelated to anything else in the film, and even though it connects with the main plot at the end, it still feels like dead weight that could have easily been entirely cut from the movie.\n\nThis is a good movie, full of heart and worth checking out just for the performances by Cube and Cedric, as well as the good tunes on the soundtrack. It just has a few too many dry stretches and the irritating ATM sub-plot, which holds me back from whole-heartedly recommending it."

Cry of the Banshee actually reminded me a lot more of the classic film Witchfinder General than either of Hessler&apos;s previous efforts, although it is nowhere near as good as that one. The plot features themes of witchcraft and witch hunts, as we focus on the evil Lord Edward Whitman, slaughterer of peasants and a man with an on-going war against a coven of local witches. He opts to murder a number of them in front of leader; a witch named Oona. However, this turns out to be a poor decision as Oona uses her magic powers to call up a magical being known as a &apos;Banshee&apos;, whom she uses - along with some members of Lord Whitman&apos;s own family - to bring a curse upon his entire household.\n\nObviously, my main reason for seeing this film was because of the fact that it features a starring performance from the great Vincent Price. This is not Vincent Price&apos;s greatest performance, but he still completely owns the film in every sequence that he&apos;s in (and he&apos;s in most of them). The character he plays in Cry of the Banshee isn&apos;t the most rounded character he&apos;s ever played, and therefore it isn&apos;t the most interesting - but hey! It&apos;s still Vincent Price. The way that the plot plays out is mostly good enough to hold the audience&apos;s interest; there isn&apos;t a great deal of suspense in the film, but director Gordon Hessler does a good job of creating the right atmosphere and setting up a suitable &apos;feel&apos; for the film. The banshee isn&apos;t what you&apos;d usually think of when that word springs to mind; which gives the film an element of memorability. The ending is decent enough, although it is rather predictable and overall, it has to be said that Cry of the Banshee is a more than passable. Sure, it&apos;s not brilliant - but Vincent Price fans are likely to enjoy it, and it gets a recommendation from me.",

Gyllenhaal is respectable as the reluctant Marine who finds himself in over his head, while Foxx is a powerhouse as his gung-ho sergeant.

      "reviewBody": "Police detective Tre Stokes (Nick Cannon) goes undercover at an upper class private school to infiltrate a car-thieving ring and find out who murdered one of the students, but he soon finds that this sort of school environment is very different from the streets of L.A.\n\nThe premise is very thin and unoriginal so the strength of the film is entirely up to Nick Cannon. Unfortunately, Nick Cannon doesn&apos;t deliver. He tries way too hard to be funny and he only manages to make a couple of jokes work. I think he has some potential but he needs to pick better scripts. Also, he should start off as a supporting actor since he doesn&apos;t really have what it takes to be a leading man, in my opinion. The main problem with the film is the script since it&apos;s very lame and offensive. Most of the jokes are racist and derivative so there&apos;s another problem. Screenwriters David Wagner and Brent Goldberg come up with a bunch of annoying clich√©s that don&apos;t work out. They don&apos;t seem to be trying at all which isn&apos;t surprising since they are responsible for My Baby&apos;s Daddy.\n\nAfter Nick Cannon, the supporting actors aren&apos;t any better and this is clearly a paycheck movie for everyone involved. Shawn Ashmore is okay as Iceman but his performance isn&apos;t very good here. Cheech Marin doesn&apos;t really do anything special and he ends up being bland. Kelly Hu and Ian Gomez both play detectives and they just look bored throughout the entire film. Roselyn Sanchez is sadly underused in her role.\n\nDirector Marcos Siega does an okay job behind the camera. He at least tries to keep things interesting with a few car sequences that should wake up the viewer. Besides for that and a few jokes, the film is a dud. The romance between Cannon and Sanchez is unbelievable and forced. Most of the supporting characters are one dimensional and they are props for Cannon&apos;s insults. The film is also pretty offensive with its racial stereotyping and outdated jokes. Underclassman could have been an enjoyable, harmless film even if it isn&apos;t original. However, the offensive script kills that opportunity and the movie ends up being below average. In the end, unless you&apos;re a big fan of Nick Cannon, skip this film. Rating 4/10",

It also happens to be a fantastic ghost story / supernatural mystery.\n\nThe character of 16 year-old Alice Palmer (Talia Zucker), who apparently died in a swimming accident, is haunting and ominous. Even when unseen. So deeply has she affected her family, that they are compelled to -finally- see her for who / what she truly was.\n\nAlice is more than a mere specter. She&apos;s a living memory, driving the Palmers to uncover the truth at all costs. The revelation of which is quite shocking, even by today&apos;s jaded standards.\n\nIf you prefer movies that creep over you gradually rather than jumps and jolts every ten seconds, then this should deliver what you need..."

      "reviewBody": "The action and thriller genres probably produce just as much if not more films than the horror genre going to straight to home video and are just as hit and miss. Dolph Lundgren has probably become one of the more main stay action stars who has really made a name for himself in this market have a well-received string of hits on the big screen. Over the last few years he has delivered countless movies that good or bad deliver something special thanks to his unique delivery. His latest Stash House is part of the new After Dark Action brand and looks to be something a bit different for him, but will it work? \n\nStash House follows a young couple who have just bought their dream house through a foreclosure price that was a steal. When they discover illegal drugs packed into the walls and realize things are not what they seem and they are in a fight for survival as they must face off against two gun toting ruthless killers who will stop at nothing to get what&apos;s theirs. This movie isn&apos;t anything all that new basically being a similar story to both films titled Trespass (1992&apos;s starring Ice Cube and Ice-T as well as the recent title starring Nicolas Cage). This is a story that has been done numerous times, but not always effectively. Here they have a decent set-up with tons of dramatic and action packed build-up, but never really finds its legs to deliver what it could have been. Lundgren delivers his usual menacing performance and is great here, but is also given a couple of moments to try and show remorse, but somehow still comes off scary. His partner in crime, literally played by Jon Huertas of ABC&apos;s Castle does a good job playing up the normal and crazy moments of his character. The rest of the cast deliver decent performances and help bring the overall film together, but the big issue is just in the story. There just isn&apos;t enough here to really step this film out of the realm of average, but enough to still make it entertaining.\n\nIf you are a Lundgren fan then you will want to check this film out. He is a bit more tame here than usual but still has that dominating screen presence he always delivers. There isn&apos;t near as much action here as you would think, but plays more as a thriller to keep you wondering what will happen next. In a world flooded with action films on the store shelve, Stash House plays way more like a bigger budget good film than most of the lame choices out there.",

Color frames are all pretty faded out to blue and white, or black and white, but the sound is actually quite good. Very specific info on which division would be landing where on the island of okinawa. The cameras are set up right along-side the soldiers and the tanks, as they moved in. This one is NOT for the faint of heart -- we DO see people get blasted by gunfire and fall over dead! Some unknown narrator describes the plans of attack on the various areas of the island... and of course they mention that F.D. Roosevelt has died during the days of the attacks on Okinawa. Much discussion of which parts of the island were taken easily, and which ones put up more of a fight. WW II buffs will undoubtedly dig this short film from the Marines. We see several kinds of mines that had been left for intruders. Rounding up of japanese families and soldiers left to try to fight off the invaders. Good summary of the division accomplishments right at the end, with a memorial to the dead. It&apos;s pretty good, as military docs go. I caught this one on &quot;moonlight movies&quot; channel.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve seen Intolerable Cruelty, you&apos;ve already got a pretty good idea about this movie, which achingly examines the possibility of true love triumphing over mere greed. \n\nSally Field is a low income artist who is just looking for a real romance, not finding much satisfaction in her relationship with Martin (Guttenburg) a self centered lawyer. What a coincidence that Shuan Stein (Caine), a wealthy writer who have written over much of his fortune to gold digging ex-lovers, should be looking for the same thing. With a few moments of good timing, the two find each other. But, Shuan Stein secretly tests his girlfriend&apos;s loyatly by hiding information about his wealth, posing instead as a poor, out-of-work writer madly in love with her. And this is where the story is enjoyable, as Sally Field and Michael Caine charm the audience as conveniently matched romantics. \n\nBut, the story becomes a drag once the movie gets into seemingly endless bickering among the characters over matters of money when Martin asks Daisy to marry him and when Daisy (as you should expect) will discover Stein&apos;s secret. At that point, everything becomes talk about money, money, money and each character (except for maybe Martin who never seems to have a clue about what&apos;s going on) doubting if true love really exists. And as a result, the sweet love story we once enjoyed among Daisy and Martin in the first half is never recovered. \n\nAs a romantic comedy, it is a tolerably sweet and funny movie, for the first half. But, I think it ran out of steam as characters never quite seem to retain or even redevelop the charm that they had in the beginning, even after they&apos;ve resolved their problems. \n\nThis is a good show by Sally Field (this is just her kind of part...kind of Murphy&apos;s Romance styled) and Michael Caine as the sweet English chap. As for Steve Guttenberg, I only didn&apos;t like him because his character was such a creep."

There is instant liking between them. Everything seems fine till James is picked up by two strange individuals whom as we understand he knew before and who begin to interrogate him, threatening his life, about a big amount of money that he supposedly possess and that actually belongs to them. James manages to escape and takes refuge at Marie&apos;s home. He&apos;s obliged to tell her the story about his past that led those to men to hunt him. The story which is shown to us in flash back sequences. \n\n   Though Nightfall doesn&apos;t stand comparison to Jacques Tourneur Film-Noir masterpiece Out of the Past, it&apos;s still quite an interesting film generally well acted with some very good dialogs in it and the most remarkable end sequence that probably served as an inspiration for the ending of brothers&apos; Coen Fargo. 7/10"

      "reviewBody": "Let me start my review by saying I grew up with Rent as a kid with the original cast recordings. I&apos;ve seen it on Broadway, and few other big cities. I have high standards that are maybe a little too high for my favorite musical. After seeing the watered-down gleeish movie version in high school(I could go on), and seeing a bad traveling version I almost gave up on Rent. Five years later, I come across what I&apos;ve always wanted: a recording of the stage show! I went in with my doubts but I think this is probably the next best thing to seeing the Original cast. Hell, I knew I wanted to buy it ten minutes in. It&apos;s a shame they didn&apos;t make this for the last original cast show, but i digress. It brings forward the true feeling of Rent,something the film didn&apos;t do. Not to mention you get to hear ALL the music, and see the story Jon Larson wrote. The actors aren&apos;t perfect at all times, I feel some seem like their copying their character voices from the OBC. and some lack the power and or soul for their role, but this is really nip picky of me because you can tell they LOVE the show. As Rent-heads do I&apos;ll say my favorites I really like Mark, Moreean, and Collins! I felt Me-me seemed a little to tamed didn&apos;t have the full edge of mi-mi. Roger and Angel were OK, but I didn&apos;t think their voices were up to belt this stuff like it should be. Joanna, the same Joanna from the movie, was even MORE awesome then she was in the film. I finally feel like I can watch Rent again without all that Hollywood watered down hairspray covered cheese wiz (Rent deserved better!). Viva La vie Boheme!!!!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "The ancient demon God Sutek is finally angry enough that Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) stole his life-giving formula that it sends some demons (tiny, of course) to the &quot;upperworld&quot; to get those responsible. Somehow that means scientists from a Government company, despite them having nothing to do with it. Who is involved is kid genius Rick Myers (Gordon Currie), who has discovered the puppets while doing his experiments at the Bodega Bay Inn while acting as a caretaker. Running only 75 minutes, this mess of a film actually has 5 screenwriters credited with the nonsense plot. The main point seems to be about resurrecting new puppet Decapitron (a hold over idea from Band&apos;s Empire days) and Toulon telling Rick he is the new puppet master. About the only good thing in the film is the stop motion work by Dave Allen and his crew, but it seems to be less and less with each entry. This marks a turning point with the tiny terrors being full blown good guys now. This was also the first in the PM series to feature no nudity. PUPPET MASTER 4 came out in November 1993 and the fifth entry, despite being filmed back-to-back, came out almost a year later in September 1994. Felton Perry has two scenes as a murdered scientist.",

      "reviewBody": "A reporter is framed and sent to prison, but with the help of a fellow con he&apos;ll try to clear his name and set things straight. That&apos;s about as far as the plot ever gets developed and it&apos;s full of holes and completely implausible events. The characters are hopelessly cliche, mostly overacted, and the melodrama of the ending goes so far over the top as to be almost laughable. And yet somehow the film has a feeling of quality and sincerity which is able to overcome all of this. \n\nSimilar to &quot;Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, this is a 1930s Warner Brothers film with a conscience, taking aim at corrupt politicians and brutal prisons. The flaws in the film are not due to lack of effort or creativity, but simply because this is the way they used to make those types of films. Jimmy Cagney and George Raft use their talent and star appeal to draw you in and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. It isn&apos;t necessarily a film you&apos;d go out of your way to see, but it&apos;s definitely worth watching if you get the opportunity.",

The movies of the &quot;Angelique&quot; series are the ULTIMATE SENTIMENTAL CLOAK AND DAGGER STORY! A whole generation of French (and not only French!!) teenagers has swooned over these movies. So much adventure, splendid 17th century costumes, romantic love, faith and treason, it is all there! Of course the events often transgress the limits of what is credible, but who cares? Just don&apos;t be ashamed of enjoying these movies! And, of course, Mich√®le Mercier is splendid as the incredibly seductive and courageous heroine &quot;Angelique&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "The highlight of the movie is watching Sidney Leeder&apos;s character flirt, tease, and taunt other crew. She&apos;s one of the few characters that has some depth, motivation, and sense of fun.\n\nJason Momoa wasn&apos;t bad as a menacing AI, but he wasn&apos;t a character to empathize with - or even to love to hate. He ultimately had the 2 dimensional motivation of an AI following his programming, but with a maniacal murder streak. Without a truly 3 dimensional villain, he may as well be a glitchy computer or one with a loose wire. He seems to want to kill and torture... just because. Senseless violence is boring.\n\nSome CGI was really entertaining. The best parts being those that blend into the scenes - like e-mail in their heads up displays. Parts of the ship were well done. The exterior shots were very well done.\n\nHonestly, I think I&apos;d have enjoyed the movie more without the killer AI - just fleshing out the prisoner characters&apos; backgrounds and interactions more and their frustrations with the limitations of their freedoms. The movie is like a bad episode of Outer Limits where we get little exposition and narrative followed by mindless violence / action sequences meant perhaps to visually impress, but utterly lacking substance. Just having Momoa on a monitor talking was more menacing and entertaining than the whole opening sequence of the movie.\n\nDavid Hewlett is one of my favorite actors. I applaud his effort in writing and directing a full length film. It&apos;s better than many made- for-TV Syfy channel craptastic flicks of the month. I think with some work, we could see this again in another form with more well rounded characters and a better story arc for the &quot;heroes&quot; and villain.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend the movie, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I&apos;d describe it as having elements of Cube, Jason X, and Hackers. I&apos;m hoping this was a proof of concept flick to show that David Hewlett is ready to take the helm of something larger.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Lookout&quot; is the kind of film there needs to be more of.\n\nIt&apos;s a pleasant, simple genre piece, unambitious, but solidly crafted with strong writing and good acting. That&apos;s a formula that is hard to find in current Hollywood movies, and it&apos;s woefully under-appreciated.\n\nGordon Joseph-Levitt has proved himself as a very good young actor, and on the strengths of this movie and last year&apos;s &quot;Brick&quot; has shown a flair for picking original projects. In this movie, he plays Chris Pratt, former king of his rural Kansas high school, now a janitor and night watchman in a dead end job at a bank after a car accident leaves his brain addled. A group of small-time hoods convince him to join their plan to rob the bank at which Chris works, preying on his need for friends and his feeling that control of his own life has been taken away. But things go badly, Chris finds out he&apos;s been used as little more than a dupe, and he gets a chance to take control when he ends up with all of the stolen money that the hoods desperately want back.\n\nThis movie belongs to that genre of films about the kinds of hopeless crime that occur out in the wide open spaces of Nowheresville, U.S.A. It&apos;s a movie whose impact relies on good plotting, pacing and suspense rather than graphic violence, and unlike so many of the films Hollywood has been producing lately, it doesn&apos;t leave you feeling awful and gloomy.\n\nJeff Daniels, who in recent years has become one of my favorite actors, does more fine work as Chris&apos;s blind friend Lewis, who, despite his handicap, sees more than anybody else in the movie.\n\nGrade: A",

      "reviewBody": "SAVAGE MAN SAVAGE BEAST is yet another mondo death porn film from the &quot;golden age&quot; of such films. Once again, a narrator drones on as animals are killed in various ways in various parts of the world.\n\nA monkey is crushed by a python. Aborigines hunt kangaroos with spears and boomerangs. Natives kill elephants and water buffalo. A British foxhunt is shown. Indeed, animals of all kinds are slaughtered by land, sea, and air.\n\nTribal rituals such as &quot;Earth impregnation&quot; and cannibalism are also examined.\n\nThe naked hippies are a hoot with their free-loving animal husbandry and drug-addled protest. We&apos;re treated to these fuzzy folks as they breastfeed lambs and give a whole new meaning to &quot;outside restroom&quot;.\n\n&quot;Documentaries&quot; like this hold a strange fascination for a certain audience. Pretty much for the same reason that we&apos;ve historically gawked at accidents or carnival freak shows.\n\nIf you enjoy shock films from yesteryear, then you&apos;ll probably love this one..."

Surprinsingly only karen Cheryl, at the time a famous anchorwoman and former singer, manages to catch our attention. She&apos;s not that bad at all.",

It seemed to me the character Lova was meant to be an angel sent to get DD to remember his sins, repent and become a better person where as &quot;man in suit&quot; (we never get his name and that is literally his credit) is the Devil, trying to keep DD in his sinful ways so that his soul will end up in Hell. I don&apos;t think anyone else got this impression but there were things in the film like when Lova says she is sensitive to fire, that made me think she was an angel and the other guy the devil.\n\nBut if you&apos;re reading this and thinking that sounds cheesy and lovey dovey (because lets face it the US versions of these types of movies are) then don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s dark and gritty and doesn&apos;t shy away form the hard stuff to a point where you question whether you should feel sorry for this character. And there&apos;s no Bible bashing (except for the scene where a Jesus of Latter Saints guy asks the Devil if he wants to be saved by Jesus). And though the ending might make some people think &quot;but I want to know more&quot; I found myself rather satisfied with the ending. Over all I liked this film, it was a refreshing, if not violent take on Angels vs Devil themed films.",

The horror is not too explicit, but is more suggestive, and this actually makes the film genuinely creepy in parts. The performances are a little amateurish by the lower cast members, but Peter Cushing is in commanding- if all too brief - form and John Carradine gives a good perf. Brooke Adams also registers well in her acting debut. The plot is daft yet manages to convince, mainly because there is a really neat exposition scene in which Cushing explains what is going on. He&apos;s such a persuasive actor that even though the whole idea is so preposterous, when he says it you kind of feel compeeled to believe him. I rate this flick and would hope that anyone reading this at the moment would go out of their way to try to see it. It&apos;s worth the time and has a weirdly effective way of sticking in your mind for a long time afterwards."

Is that not genuine? This time he lays his reputation on the line instead of his health, and to those who are offended by it: are you less offended by movies that use product placement shamelessly without informing the audience?

      "reviewBody": "This series provides some good general information but it&apos;s told from a totally biased position. The Natives are continually referred to as &quot;warlike&quot; and warrior cultures. This helps the viewers to conclude that the violence used against the natives was justified. One exmple is the retelling of the &quot;Sand Creek Massacre&quot; the viewers are told that there were atrocities committed by the U. S. Army. He never gives details of the atrocities, that included Rapes, breast cut off and scrotums removed to be used as tobacco pouches. The expert in the film justifies the anger felt by the soldiers. When in fact the soldiers in question had been chided for being &quot;bloodless&quot;. The soldiers were looking for a fight. The warriors were away leaving women, children and old people in the camp. The native accounts of the events tell of many more dead and their chief carrying a white flag to the soldiers and then being fired upon.\n\nThe event was so atrocious that the soldiers lied about the incident when they arrived in Denver. It was only after a guilt-ridden soldier sent a letter to a superior that the incident and the atrocities became known. Later the film details what were done to soldiers on one occasion, detailing disembowelment and showing a picture of the soldier obviously shown to elicit sympathy and to show the viewers that atrocious acts were committed by both sides. This is an example of how this documentatry treats the retelling of history. It continually justifies military action against women children and the eldery and repeatedly portrays the offended as hostile. It rarely mentions broken treaties, biased laws or encroachment by settlers in violation of treaties. This series minimizes the fact that the U. S. government wanted to exterminate the natives and had no intention of living in peace. They glorify Custer who graduated dead last from West Point and had a history of being reckless and brash. This film describes Custers actions at The Little Big Horn as a failed strategy instead of the over confident blunder that it was.\n\nEven the title of this doc is misleading, because what actually took place over several decades was systematic eradication and colonization. Even the beginning of this film seems to describe the inhabitants of North America as nomads and never acknowledges the original habitants right to ownership. This is the kind of retelling of history that leads to cultural and historical ignorance and fuels the racial inequities that erode the fabric of America today.",

      "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve waited four years since &quot;Quantum Of Solace&quot;, but 50 years after &quot;Dr No&quot; started the longest and most successful franchise in movie history comes the 23rd James Bond film and the third starring Daniel Craig as 007. I was 14 years old when I attended the spy&apos;s first cinematic outing; over the next couple of years, I read all 14 Ian Fleming novels; and, over the last half a century, I have gone along to the theatre to see each new film as soon as it was released. \n\nWhat was new with &quot;Skyfall&quot; is that I managed to see it a week before its general release at a special viewing for cast and crew when all mobiles were taken off us, all of us were searched, and everyone sat through the credits before applauding a brilliant team effort.\n\nThe sense of excitement was rewarded by a superb movie. A cracking opening is followed by a powerful song from Adele which is followed by a storyline that is genuinely distinctive from other Bond movies: more intelligible and more intelligent.\n\nInstead of the archetypal villain as someone crazed by megalomania, we have an adversary, subtly played by a blond Javier Bardem, who is motivated not just by power and wealth but by a very personal sense of vengeance. Instead of a Bond who easily outwits all foes, we have an agent with some obvious vulnerabilities, both physical and psychological, who does not always get his way. Instead of the usual two Bond girls, effectively we have three: French actress B√©r√©nice Marlohe in her first English-speaking part, British actress Naomie Harris in what will prove to be a break-out role, and the redoubtable 77 year old Judi Dench playing M for the seventh time in 17 years.\n\nThe film is a triumph for British director Sam Mendes, making his first British movie after such more serious successes as &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Road To Perdition&quot; and&quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;. I was shaken and stirred."

      "name": "A delightfully cheesy and fun Kong film. What&apos;s not to love?",
      "reviewBody": "It would seem that the Eight Wonder of the World isn&apos;t just popular in America. After clashing with his biggest rival Godzilla, the big ape made another appearance in Toho Co.&apos;s long line of kaiju films. Originally, King Kong was supposed to star in a film where he does battle with the sea monster Ebirah, but was ultimately replaced by Godzilla and the resulting film was &quot;Godzilla vs the Sea Monster&quot;. However, at the time there was a Kong TV series, so Toho decided to loosely adapt that into film instead. The result was a fun kaiju thrill ride that is known to this day as &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;.\n\nPlot: Somewhere in the North Pole lies a secret base, where lurks the nefarious criminal mastermind Doctor Hu (spelled Who in America, not to be confused with the TV show of the same name). Under the employment of the mysterious Madame X aka Madame Piranha, he builds a robotic version of King Kong to harvest a highly radioactive material called Element X. When Mechani-Kong proves less than reliable, Doctor Hu goes to the prehistoric jungles of Mondo Island to kidnap the real Kong to harvest the Element X. However, the great ape escapes (get it?) and with the help of his newfound human companions who discovered him on the island, King Kong does battle with his robot double in a giant-sized fight to the death in the heart of Tokyo.\n\nThis movie is cheesy and the acting is on par with the Adam West &quot;Batman&quot; series, but that&apos;s why I like it. The human characters stand out at least and have distinct personalities, from the level-headed Commander Carl Nelson, his trusted companion Jiro, and the beautiful Susan (Kong&apos;s love interest). Doctor Hu is a fun villain, over-the-top and being delightfully despicable (even if he has some ugliest bottom teeth in history). The effects are the standard guys-in-suits and miniature sets that are to be expected by Toho and, for the most part, they look good. The music by Akira Ifukube is also nice, great to hear and adding to the thrills and great action scenes throughout the film.\n\nNow for the monster roll call! Kong looks kinda silly, looking a little more like Donkey Kong without the bow tie, but he definitely looks better than his appearance in &quot;King Kong vs Godzilla&quot;. The filmmakers at least got his gorilla proportions right and he can still show emotion and character. He has the same roar as before too, which itself is cool. Now, a robot version of the ape might sound ridiculous (and it is), but Mechani-Kong is a good nemesis for his flesh-and-blood counterpart. If it weren&apos;t for Mechani-Kong, there wouldn&apos;t be a Mechagodzilla, so props to this movie. The mighty dinosaur Gorosaurus makes his first appearance in this film, putting up a good fight against King Kong, a homage to the original 1933 version. Gorosaurus would later have a role as Godzilla&apos;s ally in the hit kaiju classic &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; and gain a small bit of fame. I guess prehistoric reptiles gotta stick together, especially with those dang dirty apes around! \n\nKing Kong Escapes is an unforgettable kaiju film that definitely surpasses the dreadful &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; any day by a mile. It&apos;s full of nice characters, cool monster battles, fun cheesy effects, a memorable score, and a silly story too good to resist. Even if you&apos;re not a kaiju fan or a Kong fan for that matter, definitely check this one out for at least a few good laughs and thrills.",

      "name": "Showgirls meets Hammer Horror?",
      "reviewBody": "Showgirls meets Hammer Horror? There would be many ways to dismiss this British Thai movie, set in a seedy Bangkok go-go bar, and whose heroine turns into a nasty flesh-eating monster. Mainstream it&apos;s not, but for lovers of trashy independents it offers something of a curious mix that is almost a collector&apos;s item.\n\n(The title of the film translates apparently as &apos;Ghost&apos;; as a pun to fun-loving Thai viewers, P-Bar sounds like the Thai word for &apos;loony&apos;.) Aaw is a nice pubescent girl in rural Thailand, doing her best to look after ailing grandmom. Granny is a white witch and passes on her magic to Aaw just in case it ever comes in handy. The rural photography is beautiful, especially when we consider the film was made on a budget of ¬£180,000. The familiar tale of young girl hoodwinked into moving to the big city to support her elderly relative is part of Thailand&apos;s cultural malaise. She gets roped into prostitution of course, and it isn&apos;t long before she starts using the &apos;special powers&apos; Grandma taught her.\n\nUp to this point there is no serious suggestion of any horror elements. Ordinary Thai people tend to believe in magic as a day to day fact, even if they are devout Buddhists, and all we have seen is a pastoral tale, embellished with well-researched superstition and embroidered with lingering detail of initiation into the girlie bar trade.\n\nDirector Paul Spurrier spent five years working on the story to ensure that the seemingly trite details were authentic - research that apparently included not only looking into magic traditions but plenty of time interviewing sex workers to understand how they operate (he even cameos in the film as a bar owner). Some of the tales he told me after the film&apos;s Edinburgh Film Festival UK Premiere were both sad in their simplicity and amusing in their unexpectedness. A girl had told him how her clients had increased from 4 in a month to 30 the next month after she had gone back home to consult the shamen. The actual witchdoctor in the film was based on a character he met in N.E. Thailand; after answering many, many questions, the witchdoctor grabbed Paul&apos;s arm, pulling him ominously into the jungle, saying, &quot;I have done something for you, now you must do something for me!&quot; As the barefooted film director stumbled to keep up, the gravely stones underneath biting into his feet, the shamen looked up in surprised glee - &quot;I always wanted to know that! I had been told that Westerners&apos; feet are soft, and hurt when they walk barefoot in the forest! Now I know!&quot; At one point in the making of the film, the director made himself unpopular with the local madam after asking one of the girls (who was about to go on a recruiting expedition) why she was happily misleading people in the way that she, years earlier, had been misled. Some critics have dwelt on the morality of the film, saying it is both exploitative and lukewarm in its condemnation. While that might be true, the madam answered, &quot;You only hear from girls who think they&apos;ve been tricked. You don&apos;t hear from the hundreds of girls who find rich western husbands working here and go on abroad to marry. I don&apos;t hear them complaining.&quot; Then there was the go-go girl who asked for a copy of the movie &quot;to send back home to mom, as I don&apos;t have any nice pictures to show her where I work.&quot; Spurrier was ambivalent when questioned. He thought it was sad that girls were drawn into such a life, but that it was a fact of life for many, just like the magic traditions. It is also a backdrop for the story rather than a moral axe to grind, whether in protest or condoning.\n\nThe strange part is the sudden shift of genre into horror. There is no extensive use of CGIs - it tries, if anything, to remain true to the country&apos;s tradition (Thailand has about ten new ghost story films a year). It&apos;s simplicity recalls not only many other Asian attempts at horror but also early British films where we know the blood is not very real but choose to overlook such facts. That the abrupt change works quite well is a credit to the movie, reminding us more of the masterly film Audition than say the overladen From Dusk Till Dawn. Something evil has been growing inside of Aaw, because she has ignored the rules her grandmother taught her and she is becoming a puppet of the black magic she uses too readily. The transition from nightmares and drug-induced paranoia to the manifestation of evil is understated. Just as the sex-trade is accompanied by typical Thai modesty (no bare bosoms), the horror is shocking but not too shocking, almost as if it is meant to be &apos;entertaining&apos; rather than genuinely upsetting.\n\nThe shortfalls are the derivative story lines, the overlong details of how to work in a go-go bar (especially when all the women look and sound almost identical) and the fact that this Thai-style, British-made movie is not well aimed at any easily identifiable western market (other, perhaps, than DVD). The light-hearted humour (girls exchanging insulting comments about a customer in Thai whilst giving the unsuspecting customer adoring glances and tones, or the giggly exchanges of how to butter-up a Westerner), and the fact that it is the first Thai horror film made by a British director, may endear it to all lovers of light-hearted gore. Most films seek either great artistic acclaim or the hugest profits possible; Spurrick may simply be someone who wants to earn a living as a filmmaker in Thailand. P won&apos;t make him a fortune, but it might make him enough to fund the next episode in what could even become a cult niche.",

      "reviewBody": "The Treatment describes itself as &apos;a serious romantic comedy about life and love in NYC.&apos; The main characters are Jake Singer, an anxious young schoolteacher who has broken up with his girlfriend and seems resigned to a life of mediocrity; his shrink, Dr Ernesto Morales (Ian Holm), who describes himself as the last great Freudian - &apos;in a line stretching from Moses to Aristotle;&apos; and Allegra Marshall, a beautiful young socialite that takes a fancy to him.\n\nThe film aims at a serious note with the unrelenting, intrusive and almost sadistic treatment meted out by Dr Morales. Jake&apos;s baggage is all too obvious and (although there must be easier routes) the &apos;treatment&apos; does show signs of working, even when Jake starts wondering if he has maybe just &apos;hallucinated&apos; the encounters. A sub-plot about adoption tries to bring in some emotional ballast to fill the chasm left by Jake and Allegra&apos;s lack of on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe Treatment meanders along like an episode of Sex and the City or Frasier - only where nothing much happens. At first captivating, the endless litany of inconsequential detail and forced humour soon begins to wear. &quot;I thought he was supposed to make you feel more comfortable in your own skin,&quot; says Allegra about Jake&apos;s analyst. &quot;No, he&apos;s more the exfoliating type.&quot; In discussing one of Jake&apos;s favourite books, Allegra quotes a comment about the author re-drawing the landscape to place equal emphasis on what&apos;s not said. Sadly, this film has too much that is said; and that which is not said has too little substance to justify the barely relevant meanderings of school sports halls or Dr Morales&apos; questions about sexual positions. Ian Holm delivers a fine performance, but the script, while not completely without merit, has too little to for such a great actor to get his teeth into. We are told that the lover in Jake is under-nourished and the self-pitying side over-fed: much the same could be said of this bloated, drawn-out and not particularly engaging film.",

I don&apos;t think there was a lot to it, but it was a decent enough watch... there are certainly worse ways to spend 100 minutes or so.",

      "reviewBody": "CONFESSIONS is one of the most savage, brutal and poignant revenge stories I have ever seen. It doesn&apos;t start off all that great, but it by the end I was in awe. The movie begins in a Japanese classroom on the final day of classes before the spring break and the remainder of the movie are the events that follow the fateful day in this classroom.\n\nThe point of view switches numerous times throughout to different people affected by the event in the beginning. As the movie progresses you revisit past scenes from different character&apos;s perspectives but the scenes are never monotonous because you know much more the second time around. Much like an onion, CONFESSIONS is multi-faceted and there is much to discover and re-discover as each subsequent layer is peeled back.\n\nA beautiful thing about this movie, at least for me, is how wildly my sympathy flip-flopped. Don&apos;t take sides too adamantly because as you learn more and more about the characters and events of the movie your sympathy too is bound to jump ship to the point where you&apos;re not totally sure who to side with. CONFESSIONS challenges you in this way. Some may find it frustrating but it just added to CONFESSIONS&apos;s charm and wit.\n\nUnrelentingly dark, this movie is bound to incite feelings of bleakness and perhaps is not suited to those with a weak heart. The subject matter is heavy, the characters are morally-reprehensible and the feel of the movie is wholly somber ‚Äì from the greys and dull blues which saturate each and every scene to the melancholy (albeit perfectly-suited) soundtrack which works its way infectiously into your mind and makes the horrific scenes before your eyes resonate deeply.\n\nI will not spiel on for much longer, but in closing; the acting is top-notch; the storytelling is captivating; the cinematography is gorgeous; and the touches of violence and blood are done in taste and to immense effect ‚Äì never feeling gratuitous.\n\nI have seen many Japanese films but this one takes the cake as one of the best I have ever seen. If what I&apos;ve said so far sounds convincing enough definitely give this movie a shot because I am rather hard to please and it did not let me down an ounce.",

This is the story about a little princess who wishes for the Christmas star and goes out in the woods to find it on Christmas eve. She disappears from the kingdom and although us viewers knows where she is, the king doesn&apos;t. As the queen goes out to find her, the king cast a curse on the star and his queen disappears as well.\n\nWhat the king does not know is that the count, who is the kings cousin, has something to do with this terrible happening and he makes the count feel more than welcome to be his closest man.\n\nMany years later a girl called Sonja is travelling with a bunch of entertainers and after performing for the king she begs him for a chance to go out and find the star. Once again the count interferes but does he succeed again? Well, that is up to you to find out.\n\nThis is a fantastic movie for both children and grown ups where Sonja even meets Father Christmas on her way to find the star.\n\nThe problem is I don&apos;t know if it has been made for any other countries than the Scandinavian ones.....",

This documentary takes a fairly in depth look at the lives of 3 particular games being developed, and the personal lives of those creating it(Fez,Super Meat Boy and Braid). Focusing more on the positive and negative aspects of how the process effects the people involved is what draws you in. There is no acting, action, etc. just the real life drama that goes into deadlines, marketing, and all things aside from what code to put on what page. The presentation may not be for all viewers but it definitely is interesting to see where a person can snap, or reap the rewards of years of hard work even when others wrote them off as crazy. I was personally drawn into the inner conflicts that were shown to real feel the real life emotions. Must see for gamers, that is for sure, but also for a casual viewer, I believe that it is something interesting to see just what goes on day by day (they seem to keep hours like me). 6.4/10",

I am not a Robert Redford fan and I was not familiar with the work of James Gandolfini, but because I am an action fan and the trailer made this out to look like a not to bad action movie I decided to pick it up. The problem with most action movies that run over two hours is that they usually become boring and bogged down with confusing plot twists that ruin the entertainment value. But this movie never once became boring, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Redford and Gandolfini lit up the screen with red hot performances that kept you at the edge of your seat. This movie has everything you could ask for in an action movie, strong performances, strong script, beautifuly directed action sequences and dare I say it, a few touching moments. Redford plays a war hero who is sent to a prision for war verterians. He then plans an uprising against the corrupt prision guard. Your heart will instantly go out to a shy inmate who was accused of beating someone to death with a hammer. The film also has some of the most mouth dropping action scenes that I&apos;ve seen in a long time. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. So whether you are a fan of prision movies like The Shawshank Redemption or Fortress or a hardened action fan this movie will not dissapoint. I rank this film as one of the best of 2001 along side Made.",

The depth of the story can be better as well.\n\nThe actors do a good job, but there isn&apos;t much time to really get to know them.\n\nAll in all, a movie that did not disappoint me as an Assassins Creed fan, but not the best movie of the year either.",

      "reviewBody": "THE PERFECT HOLIDAY is another one of those typical holiday films that some have touted as the &quot;first African-American ensemble&quot; that plays like its a television special than a theatrical release. This is another one of those hair-splitting claims that requires us to consider another movie about another over-the-top out of control African-American family going through the motions around the most joyous time of the year. For one,Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut make a sexy caramel couple. Maybe that explains why they&apos;re always paired up in movies. In this case you didn&apos;t get enough of their chocolate combo work in such films as &quot;The Brothers&quot;,&quot;Two Get Play That Game&quot;,and &quot;Breaking All The Rules&quot;. This time around they&apos;re back in &quot;The Perfect Holiday&quot;. &quot;Holiday&quot; has Chestnut playing a struggling singer-songwriter working part time as a mall Santa. Apparently, this must be at the progressive mall if they&apos;re hiring a brotha to play of the traditionally alabaster St. Nick.\n\nWhen a little girl(Khail Bryant)hops on this fake Santa&apos;s lap,all she asks for is a man to pay her mom(Union)a compliment she tells her friends she would like. Once our Kriss Kringle sees how mochalicious this girl&apos;s mama is,he decides to fulfill the wish himself. This sets off a farcial courtship between the two,which mostly has him keeping an eye out for one of her other children(Malik Hammond),who tries to prank this fool out of his mom&apos;s life(Fortunately,baby girl hips him to her big bro&apos;s tricks whenever he&apos;s in Santa mode.)The boy wants his mom to get back together with their father(Charlie Murphy of Chappelle&apos;s Show),an egostistical rapper our part-time Father Christmas-who doesn&apos;t know he&apos;s going out with his ex-is also hoping to work with. As cute and cuddly as this sounds,I have seen better movies with the same plot line and it is basically forgettable. What follows next is a series of events so uninspired and delusional that an old soul like Father Christmas couldn&apos;t save this fiasco of a film with a strong black cast. And speaking of the supporting cast,the actors are mostly made up of former UPN and WB sitcom players not to mention former comedians(Faizon Love from WB&apos;s &quot;The Parenthood&quot;and was also in the first &quot;Friday&quot; film opposite Ice Cube and Chris Tucker;Rachel True from &quot;Half and Half&quot;;Jill Marie Jones-aka Toni Childs from &quot;Girlfriends&quot;,and I know some of you wonder whatever happened to her after her departure from that show...;not to mention comedian Katt Williams and a host of others from &quot;BET&apos;s Comicview&quot;)who look as if they took the job because,they didn&apos;t have much else to do.\n\nThe baffling parts of this are the special guest appearances by Queen Latifah and Terrance Howard as the night-and-day spirits who decide the fate of these characters. Terrance Howard is totally waste here(who looks like he doesn&apos;t want to belong in this in the first place and for an actor with an impaccable capacity of playing good roles),and it shows in some of the performances since the only saving grace here is Latifah herself who keeps this movie afloat,since Latifah&apos;s production company Flavor Unit films produced this movie which explains why she is there(Latifah serves as executive producer). But it is nice to see Union and Chestnut once again on the screen making black beautiful which is the only saving grace here."

      "reviewBody": "Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal&apos;s latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It&apos;s sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It&apos;s become somewhat of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact he doesn&apos;t perform his own dialogue, but it&apos;s not something I&apos;d have expected from Snipes. Perhaps it&apos;s due to the producer, Andrew Stevens who has worked with Seagal previously, or the director Po-Chi Leong, responsible for Seagal&apos;s epically bad Out Of Reach.\n\nThe plot involves shady government officials, terrorists who coach soccer teams, disks with incriminating evidence on and a hefty chuck of missing money. Oh and biological weapons. Now how they are connected I don&apos;t know but what I can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to fathom and like many of these DTV movies, this likes to include one twist too many. The plot is also uninterestingly told, playing out it&apos;s cards with people having shady one to ones in offices and dark alleys etc. It&apos;s all kind of &quot;lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film!&quot; The pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the dullness of the performances and the storyline, the film does have some nice action scenes. As an example of how a DTV film has successfully put across a storyline of a twisting nature, I give you Dolph Lundgren&apos;s directorial debut, the Defender. That movie had it&apos;s share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action, with Dolph under siege form terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of action, on the move, while avoiding death. The movie doesn&apos;t stop to tell us what&apos;s happening, it doesn&apos;t break up the pace. As such although the plot was a little convoluted, it was more forgivable cause the action never let up. The Detonator like too many of these films, stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who&apos;s bad, and who isn&apos;t, before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end. These movies can often suffer with pacing issues.\n\nSnipes himself as I mentioned is pretty bland here. At the beginning he&apos;s putting on a camp persona as he&apos;s undercover with some arms dealers. Initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleepwalking through the role. Snipes only comes alive when he&apos;s called upon to kick ass. There&apos;s some nice action here though, with some swift and crunching martial arts and some nicely punchy shootouts. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca co-star and she&apos;s not much of an actress, but she is gorgeous, with a costume that screams &quot;look at my cleavage!&quot; The rest of the cast flit in and out with clich√©d and uninteresting roles.\n\nSnipes thankfully has better projects lined up from now. He has another team up with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he will do Chasing The Dragon, from the director Chris Nahon, who did Jet Li&apos;s Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally Snipes is apparently doing Toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly looking brighter for Snipes, but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his DTV films, around $7million a movie, possibly more. It&apos;s also funny to consider that of all these DTV god&apos;s Dolph Lundgren is doing the better films, directing himself, with the enjoyable Defender and the supremely violent and nicely done The Russian Specialist, and what&apos;s more he&apos;s doing them on a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. *1/2",

      "reviewBody": "I love talking about things I have no true understanding of or things I sort of understand but do not possess an extensive amount of knowledge on. For an aspiring journalist, or even a formal journalist, that&apos;s a deadly move. A majority of the debates I engage in and possess a pretty modest amount of knowledge on is politics and the controversial debates within it. Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare serves as my background and my informative tool to the enormously complex and argumentative issue of healthcare in America.\n\nThe film is broken up into fairly simple, concise chapters, each of them trying to break apart and dissect the enormous issue at hand. We&apos;re told from the start, Americans pay record amounts for healthcare, yet receive mediocre treatment and don&apos;t even have a very high life expectancy compared to other developed countries who pay significantly less money for treatment. One doctor, who we see working her final day at a local hospital, claims the biggest flaw with the hospital community is that management and the government care more about &quot;productivity&quot; rather than how much care and attention is supplied to patients. Dr. Don Berwick, former head of Medicare and Medicaid, states that the doctors and the nurses have been doing their job correctly for years, but the job design in itself is flawed and hugely misses the ball on the bigger issue which is to try and give people the best and most reputable care they need.\n\nShannon Brownlee, director of the New America Health Policy Program, states that healthcare, like everything else in America, is like a business; they don&apos;t want you to die, but they don&apos;t want you to get better, they just want you coming back. She goes on to state that the United States spends over $300 billion on pharmaceuticals, and that it and New Zealand are the only countries in the world where it is legal to advertise and solicit drugs on Television. We as a society have become dependent on some kind of pill, whether we&apos;d like to admit it or not. One of the first things you hear at a doctor&apos;s office is what tiny orange capsule of pills they will prescribe to you and the final thing you hear after one of those monotonous, ubiquitous drug commercials is &quot;ask your doctor.&quot; I remember an interview talk radio host Mancow Muller conducted with documentarian Morgan Spurlock of Super Size Me once where Spurlock stated that there is a pill for almost every possible problem and the first thing we are told when having pain is to &quot;take a pill.&quot; Why work to relieve it when you can take a supplement and carry on? Perhaps the United States&apos; &quot;on the go&quot; society is to blame. Everywhere you look there are take-out places, to-go coffee cups, or even meals on the go - all you need to do is microwave them (another invention saving loads of time). Sure there are healthier alternatives, but when you go to McDonald&apos;s and see a salad for six dollars and a burger for as low as ninety-nine cents, in this tight economy, what are you more likely to vouch for? And if you decide to vouch for that salad, what happens when you put dressing on top with all that fat, sugar, and sodium? You&apos;ve effectively soiled a healthy meal.\n\nWe are informed there was a drug on the market, with numerous commercials, optimistic and convincing in presence, called &quot;Avandia,&quot; which was used to combat diabetes and maybe even rid the system of it. Dr. Steven Nissen found out traitorous information on the drug, that it was causing heart failure and heart attacks that the company kindly hid from the world. He went all the way to court, fighting its recall until he was successful in 2011.\n\nWe are heading towards a grim future. Lower pay, longer hours, fewer jobs, poorer education, grossly unaffordable food prices, minimal economic growth, a more dictative government, the end of retirement, and if this film&apos;s facts continue to prove prophetic, worse healthcare. If there were any documentary capable of brewing cynicism and pessimism, yet also able to enlighten a viewer on a complex issue, it&apos;s Escape Fire.\n\nNOTE: The title apparently comes from the Mann Gulch fire in 1949, where smoke jumpers were deployed to stop a fire in the Helena National Forest Preserve in Montana. Thirteen men died as a result of this fire, but one of the survivors was a man named Wag Dodge. As him and his crew were running away from the fire just a few yards behind them, he lit a match setting fire to the grass in front of him successfully creating a dry circle around him now called an &quot;escape fire.&quot; Dodge attempted to get his other crew into the circle, but due to an unfortunate miscommunication, they perished and he was the only one to emerge from it alive. We as a society need to create a metaphoric &quot;escape fire&quot; for healthcare and implore those in our society to join in it.\n\nStarring: Don Berwick, Shannon Brownlee, Steve Burd, Steven Nissen, Robert Yates, and Wendell Potter. Directed by: Susan Fr√∂mke and Matthew Heineman.",

      "reviewBody": "The short unhappy life of Herbert Norkus, a young member of the Hitler Youth who was killed by Communist street thugs is the basis of this film, entitled in English, Our Flags Lead Us Forward. The martial song you hear vocally and instrumentally throughout the film was the official song of the Hitler Youth and the words were written by Baldur Von Schirath the organizer of the group. Note in the opening credits the producers at UFA give thanks to the members of the Hitler Youth Berlin chapter who appeared as extras in the film.\n\nThe film is only the Herbert Norkus story indirectly. A novel that was required reading for the Hitler Youth was the basis for the film and said novel was written K.A. Schenzinger. I&apos;m sure it was quite the potboiler. Of course that allowed the Nazis to take quite a bit of poetic license with the truth and they never passed up an opportunity to do that.\n\nJurgen Ohlssen plays Heinie Volker who is being apprenticed to the trade of printer and he comes from parents who are Communist in their political sympathies. In the year of 1932 with Germany in the midst of the Depression many competing groups and ideologies were battling to rule the Reich. The neighborhood that the Volkers live in is a working class area that the Communists are dominant.\n\nHeinrich George is Heinie&apos;s father who is on relief and is idle, way too idle. He beats on his wife and rags his son to join the Young Communist League. But the kid is attracted to those clean cut, fresh scrubbed teens in their uniforms with their marching songs. They all look quite middle class and he wants to be one of them. If you remember in The Young Lions, Marlon Brando&apos;s character discusses how Hitler has promised to do away with the class system so prevalent in Europe. Young Ohlssen is exhibit number one for Brando&apos;s contention.\n\nThe film is interesting on a number of levels. Other than Henie&apos;s long suffering mother played by Berta Drews the only female role of any consequence is that Rotraut Richter who plays Gerda, a teenage temptress who works as a Communist agent, luring the Hitler Youth away from their duty. There is a conspicuous lack of the female gender in the Hitler Youth at least at these gatherings. When the Nazi state was established the Hitler Youth did have a woman&apos;s auxiliary of sorts where the girls were taught to be good breeders and mothers to make and raise plenty of good Aryan youth for the Fatherland. Nazi Germany was one of the most patriarchal societies ever created on Earth.\n\nOther Nazi targets most prominently Jews get not a mention in Our Flags Lead Us Forward. The film strictly concerned with the Communist menace. All the Communists in contrast to the Hitler Youth are these plug ugly proletarian types who smoke cheap cigars and get stinking drunk when they&apos;re not infecting our workers with Bolshevist ideas. The father Heinrich George is such a man although later in a good scene, George is talking to Ohlssen about how all he wants is the best for his son and society has to change in order for that to happen. A more complex character than you would think would appear in a film that is strictly labeled propaganda. But then again it&apos;s what makes it more affective.\n\nThe bleakness of Depression Era Berlin plays like one of our noir films and the kids are shown as the hope for Germany&apos;s future. As it turned out these kids who were the extras in the film probably 90% of them died during World War II. A truly lost generation.\n\nOur Flags Lead Us Forward is a slick piece of propaganda designed to recruit the impressionable young German minds who did not want to think of themselves as a beaten country from World War I. Viewed with a critical eye about its purposes, it holds up very well for examination today.",

      "reviewBody": "The 1980s saw a proliferation of &quot;teen movies&quot;. About 90% of them had nothing new to really say, starred teen &quot;heart throbs&quot; and were marketed ONLY to younger, dumber audiences. I was in my teens and twenties in this era, but even I thought these movies were awful==obviously I was the correct age but just &quot;didn&apos;t get it&quot;. Uh, huh.\n\nMany of these movies featured crude and dumb humor, ample boobies (which is odd, considering the audience technically was too young to be admitted to many of these dreadful films) and low production values. As I said before, the movies seemed to be marketed to dumb people. Don&apos;t believe me?! Well think back to such films as the PORKY&apos;S movies, Freddy Kruger films, HALLOWEEN, the later ROCKY films, etc. These films truly were awful.\n\nSo, with all this dreck, it was nice to see a few teen-oriented films that didn&apos;t insult the audience or feature mind-rot. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (as well as films such as BETTER OFF DEAD) was a decent film that actually had something to say to teens--and it could be enjoyed by adults as well (what a concept). While the story does have its sexy jokes, teens who know more than adults and silly escapades, it manages some originality and some genuine laughs. It&apos;s cute how an innocent little trek into the city results in a long series of unbelievable and dangerous consequences--many of which are quite funny. Give it a try--it&apos;s not &quot;rocket science&quot; or Masterpiece Theatre, but it&apos;s good old fashioned silly fun.\n\nPS--watch ALL the movie--including the very end. Many times on TV they cut off the very end, but on video or DVD it&apos;s there. So, DON&apos;T turn it off when the credits roll.",

Be it a short story or not, in every one of his movies, Ray has been a beacon by conveying his socially progressive ideas. He&apos;s a master at exposing the fault lines in the Indian society and delivering his wisdom packaged in a entertaining manner. I saw the movie in a combination pack with another one of his shorts - Kapurush. Kapurush is an emotion-packed drama. It captures the anxiety and rekindling of emotions of a chance meeting between two estranged lovers.",

This could have backfired badly had this movie laid an egg but as it turned out it is one of both the director and his leading actor&apos;s best efforts. No one writes in a vacuum, of course, and those with long memories will recall Charles Laughton asking Ray Milland to investigate a murder that he (Laughton) himself had committed and then making Milland the patsy. This in turn was echoed in Orson Welles&apos; &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot;. No matter, we can always use one more outstanding thriller and this one fits the bill to a tee shirt or, if you will, jacket. Montand scores heavily, as you would expect, as the cop who is unaware that his boss is sleeping with his (Montand&apos;s) girl friend. When, one night, a quarrel ends in tears the boss, also unaware that he shares a lover with his best detective, assigns Montand to the case, and the fascination lies in seeing Montand peeling the onion that will lead to himself (he had gone to call on his girl friend, unaware that she had been killed and left, natch, clues to his visit). Montand&apos;s real-life wife, the great Simone Signoret, turns in a fine cameo as the wife of the police chief and the poignant scene where she asks Montand&apos;s help in shooting herself is not only a highlight but to those aware of the on-set drama surrounding the scene (Signoret had enormous difficulty in going thru with it)a fitting remembrance of one of the all-time great French actresses. A feast for Montand fans."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Older women are best, because they always think they may be doing it for the last time.&quot; Ian Fleming \n\nWomen in love . . . or lust . . . or longing. Heading South, set in Haiti in the &apos;70&apos;s, is paradise for needy but wealthy middle-aged women. Young black men are willing to share their love for either dollars or gifts, while the women get something they can&apos;t buy elsewhere: respect and orgasms. It all seems much purer than men seeking young girls in Thailand, yet there is usually trouble in paradise.\n\nThree intertwining stories are told into camera of Ellen (Charlotte Rampling), who regularly comes here and has become attached to young Legba (Menothy Cesar); Brenda (Karen Young), who came once before with her husband and now threatens to steal Legba from Ellen; and Sue, an overweight, brassy Canadian. Nothing much happens but some petty jealousiesover Legba, until director Cantet goes outside the circle of thismodest resort where Papa Doc&apos;s dictatorship touches quietly on theirlives. In fact, the most powerful part of the film occurs in the opening scene, where a black mother tries to give away her daughter to a prosperous black man in order to avoid the child&apos;s being taken from her, as often happens to poor blacks in Haiti.\n\nAlthough a couple of the black men are filmed naked, and Brenda&apos;s breasts are revealed after a shower, there is little sex to spice up the film, regardless of the sexy premise. If Heading South had done more with the political and social unrest on the island, as a metaphor for the women&apos;s unrest at the resort, there would have been a much more substantial film. We are left with a not very interesting plot bolstered by very interesting and beautiful older actresses, Rampling and Young."

My favorite part is watching all the 100&apos;s of people on the streets on New York City not having a clue that the are immortalized in this motion picture. I love to freeze frame the street scenes and view how life was like in 1948. So many surprises, for example in the phone booth scene, notice the two men peering out the window in the store across the street. I think those guys were aware of the filming, but as the scene continued, they went back to serving their customers. Just plain magic. There is also a cool goof in this film. Note during the train station chase scene, just after Frank runs by, the director or a film crew member turns towards the camera and yells what I believe is &quot;CUT&quot;...So Fun....I&apos;ll see again and again and again!"

I would like to put in a word of praise for the academy award winning editor Ferris Webster. Webster&apos;s crowning achievement was the famed &apos;garden party&apos; sequence in which the malevolent communist agents are transformed into ladies at a garden club and back again, the vertigo of the circling camera draws us into the actual mental state of the brainwashed captives. Each camera movement, each shot was so exquisitely timed and placed that this is almost equal to the shower-bath scene in Psycho as a classic of modern editing. This scene is still studied in film schools by future editors. Also, the cutting in the finale scene at the convention expertly creates a Hitchcockian suspense totally dependent on the editing.\n\nAnother aside, Angela Lansbury &apos;cut her teeth&apos; for this role playing the ruthless newspaper owner in the Tracy-Hepburn film State of the Union. In that film she managed to upstage Hepburn herself! And it was obvious that she should play the &apos;biggest, baddest mother of all&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "If you have never seen the movie &apos;Office Space&apos;, there is a scene where the main dude says &quot;I&apos;m gonna go home and watch kung-fu. Do you watch kung-fu?&quot; after deciding that he could care less about work. Several hours ago, I was faced with the same situation: Do I study for my exams, or do I some watch kung-fu movies? Well, after some consultation and noticing the un-watched copy of &apos;Martial Outlaw&apos; sitting on my desk, I came to the conclusion that I would be better off watching some kung-fu. That would come to be the best decision I&apos;ve ever made.\n\nJeff Wincott plays Kevin White, a DEA agent, master of the ways of arse kicking, and not-quite-yet a master of the snappy comeback. On the trail of a Russian drug-lord named Niko (Vladimir Skomarovsky), Kevin ends up back in his hometown of Los Angeles, where his brother Jack (Gary Hudson) is a cop, and also master of the ways of arse kicking. Jack is quite jealous of his little brother: Kevin went to college, Kevin is a better fighter, Kevin is a higher paid and higher ranking cop, and Kevin has a more impressive physique. OK, the last one was a guess: Kevin removes his shirt at any opportunity, while Jack stays clothed for the whole movie. When Kevin arrives in town, Jack sees an opportunity to make a deal with Niko and walk away a millionaire.\n\nThe box makes a point of stating that &apos;Martial Outlaw&apos; is &quot;from the makers of &apos;Martial Law&apos;&quot; which might explain why the plots for both movies were... almost exactly the same. That&apos;s right, tweak a few details and &apos;Martial Law&apos; becomes &apos;Martial Outlaw&apos;. Awesome. Naturally, both the plot and acting in this are as weak as Jeff Wincott is ripped, but that is to be expected when watching a direct-to-video martial arts film. In fact, Gary Hudson sounds suspiciously like Bruce Campbell, the king of b-movies, through most of the film...\n\nThe action scenes are somewhat impressive, given the nature of the film. Small action movies are generally entertaining, but &apos;Martial Outlaw&apos; could fool you into thinking that it came from Hong Kong in the 80s / early 90s. The fights aren&apos;t THAT good, but for a small action movie, they are well choreographed. Unfortunately, they degenerate into the pure silliness mastered by Hong Kong movies from the 70s. Still is more entertaining and better choreographed than nearly anything with a big budget that has come out of Hollywood recently. Awesome.\n\nDavid Carradine is nowhere to be seen in this movie. On the other hand, Al Leong can be spotted doing his generic Asian bad guy thing. I guess an Al Leong appearance is always assumed for any American action movie.\n\n&apos;Martial Outlaw&apos; is an entertaining action movie, but the only people who should watch it are the small group of action fans who have even heard of it. Bad plot and acting, along with rampant silliness would turn most people off - 6/10 \n\nAwesome count: The word &apos;awesome&apos; was used twice in this review.",

      "reviewBody": "At the dawn of the cinema, it was Italy where actually great spectacles were born. They had the locations at hand. Along the famous CABIRIA made a few years later (which also celebrated its centenary), QUO VADIS by Enrico Guazzoni based faithfully upon Henryk Sienkiewicz&apos;s novel, not only stunned the audience of the time being played in many road theaters but also set the standards for the very genre (as many reviewers have stated before me). More to say, Sienkiewicz&apos;s novel became one of the top literary sources which inspired so many filmmakers to bring the first century Rome, the decadence and fall of emperor Nero (reigning 54-68 A.D) and the rise of Christianity in the center of the empire to screen. The most famous version enjoying the international renown to this day is, of course, Mervyn LeRoy&apos;s (1951). However, great as the ultra popular QUO VADIS is, this one appears to be more faithful to the novel but requires a very special perception. Allegedly, Henryk Sienkiewicz himself saw this motion picture which we can see now after the restoration co-financed by the Lumiere Project.\n\nAmleto Novelli, Carlo Cattaneo, Cesare Moltini, Lea Giunchi, Gustavo Serena...the cast of the time do not make any special impression on us these days. Similarly to stagy silent movies of the 1910s, they may appear as &apos;phantoms&apos; moving within the frame of the screen without desirable close-ups that would instill some understanding of the characters&apos; feelings. Yet, that is not the strength of the movie.\n\nThe major phenomenon of this silent QUO VADIS (there was another silent version with Emil Jannings as Nero which occurred a flop) are the moments of great aesthetic intensity. Mostly operatic in its feeling, it supplies a viewer with an unbelievable &apos;image&apos; of the novel&apos;s content. It is not the novel so to say &apos;filmed&apos; or pictured but art of a new medium (at the time) which beautifully combines literature and cinema. With no words necessary, the movie does not disturb imagination but rather inspires its unknown spheres. From the banquet at Nero&apos;s through the fire of Rome, the shots of the arena and St Peter meeting Christ on the Appian Way (the climax of the story here though not so historically chronological), the scenes may still occur highly entertaining. \n\nWe watch a distant past, we have a glimpse of early cinema&apos;s vision and both the storytelling and the execution of the content become to us quite &apos;archaic.&apos; That aspect appears as tremendously involving.\n\nThere is not much to say about performances, about music score, about special effects. Yet, there is something inspiring about depriving oneself of all the prefabricated expectations of an &apos;entertaining&apos; movie, about beating the &apos;cliches&apos; of &apos;silent film equals to boring film&apos; and allowing oneself to view it in a fresh manner as if it still had something to offer after more than a century. And believe me, it does.",
