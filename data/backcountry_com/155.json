Although the quality of this product is great it&apos;s design lacks, which is why I can only give it three stars.\n\nThe biggest issue that I have with this bib is the zipper placement. It does not go all the way down to the crotch and this makes it very difficult when you need to relieve yourself. I end up having to take the shoulder straps off each time which to me defeats the purpose of having the zipper in the first place. If the zipper went all the ways down to the crotch without it being blocked with that extra material this problem would not exist. Additionally, there is only one pocket and for the price I expected there to be multiple.",

Have had these for three years now and are still putting up with my abuse. The only reason I wouldn’t buy them again is because I’m 6’5” and they don’t really fit me. Tried to extend the straps, no luck. I finally just took them to a seamstress and had them extended. Problem solved. But wish every clothing company out there really would consider us tall humans.

They lasted me one entire season (7 months) and only one month into this current season. My heart is broken but I will still forever wear Grundens as they are unmatched.

        "reviewBody": "Wanted to love this shirt, was super stoked on it when it came out of the package.  A lot of merino shirts don&apos;t have a ton of stretch but this one does, and it felt great on.  However, after one wearing, the fit is just awful.  With this, stretch translates to stretch OUT.  For some reason the bottom stretched out horizontally to the point where it looked like I was wearing the liberty bell.  And while the length in the back is perfect, with the sideways stretching, it became basically a crop top in the front.  Cannot dream up a shirt less flattering than too short in the front with a bottom hem that flounces out like a poodle skirt.  Major disappointment because the fabric and color were both fabulous fresh outta the bag.  But honestly even at like 50% off I wouldn&apos;t buy this again.",

Its breathable and manages sweat well- doesnt weigh down. After a couple wears, it stretches slightly but still looks good. My one complaint is that the fabric is delicate- it tears easily. It already has a noticeable spot where I caught the velcro of a pack. Maybe to be expected for how lightweight it is. Ill still buy another one or two but will be mindful, especially when climbing.",

They will take whatever Mother Nature can dish out without a leak. Strong frames and quality construction is in a league of its own. Easy set up, with 4 foot flaps over screening give the NB12 a total of 20X20 feet of rain protection. Roof vents aid greatly in ventilation. I could go on much more, but you get the point. Bottom line: Yes it’s expensive BUT worth every penny. We just weathered Tropical Storm Debbie WITHOUT A SINGLE DROP ENTERING.",

If you actually set them up like that and it rained, the rain would run down into the shelter (I use bungees to attach to trees at the right level) I put a pole wedged in the picnic table with a cup on top to prop the entrances up higher so I don&apos;t have to duck as much\r\nThe opening is too short- I&apos;m 5&apos;7 and have to duck to get in\r\n2) The screen should have a better roll up system so you can tie it above the entrance so it doesn&apos;t hang down and make the opening even lower.  As it is it also won&apos;t roll up and out of the way- sort of a spider web effect in the corner-same situation on the side panels- they roll up but hang down below the top of the shelter\r\n3) Mine is dark blue- it looks like the color has since changed which is good as the blue can make it pretty hot inside\r\n\r\nI wish I could get on an Eureka panel to review new products because when you camp for 2 weeks in a row, you get to know you&apos;re equipment pretty well.",

          "Thank you for your thoughtful review! Here&apos;s a good tech tip regarding the awning in rain...move the bottom of the poles closer to the structure and re-tension the guy lines. This lowers the tips of the poles and the awning fabric will slope AWAY from the main structure. You may have to duck under the lower awning but...water will drain AWAY from the structure instead of towards it. Have fun out there!!!!"

You can be completely sealed off from any rainstorm or breeze. I especially love that each wall can either fully or partially opened or closed. It makes for an ideal set up each time. I get a lot of compliments and questions when in use as it has a nice aesthetic design and can take on a variety of configurations.",

Me and my grandkids put it up and used it on a nice sunny breezy day the polls are durable so they did not sway back and forth stayed very sturdy the awning was a nice thing to have up to get shade and the screened-in area was nice when I got a little darker in the book started coming out it started a Sprinkle also and I noticed it was very waterproof there wasn&apos;t any leakage. Assembly part of the screen house was pretty simple if you know a standard setup for a tent. all the polls already bound together with bungee and they pop into place almost by itself.\r\n otherwise there is built-in directions in the duffle bag the only con I would say would be that you definitely will need more than one person to set it up because it&apos;s so big it&apos;s not a one-man setup it&apos;s at least a two person setup process.\r\nI definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new screen house this one definitely an amazing product he won&apos;t be let down.",

I am 5&apos;10&quot; and this shirt is perfect in every way except that it&apos;s a little too short in front. The hemline is intentionally scooped so that it&apos;s longer in back and shorter in front. When I raise my arms over my head, the front hem is at my ribcage... so it&apos;s not very gym friendly, better for an activity like running or maybe hiking, although the back vent means I&apos;d need to apply sunscreen to a rather unreachable part of my back. So this top is probably not going to get as much wear as my other icebreaker t-shirts. It&apos;s a cute design and I like the fabric, but the functionality is a little bit compromised for me.",

Not only is it attractive and the colors are amazing, I bought all three colors, but it keeps me cool running in hot temperatures. I run in the desert up to 96 degrees in these shirts. I wear a medium in other brands but a large in icebreaker tops. The slit in the back makes a nice vent for heat to escape and the shirt flows AWAY from the body which allows for airflow over the skin. The air also flows through this fabric cooling me down and when it is saturated in sweat it still feels cool to the skin. Awesome! Functional and attractive. What more could you want?",

There&apos;s no texture to the grips that my gloves can mesh with and on several occasions I caught myself thanking God my grip didn&apos;t completely release from the bar.

        "reviewBody": "Out of the box, amazing comfort for my feet. I have metatarsalgia so I cannot put pressure on the ball of my foot. I also have hammerhead toes and a bunion on one foot.  The wide toe box, even in the regular size 9, was like a dream come true. The heels of my feet are narrow so I cannot wear a wide size without my feet slipping out.  This style has a lift in the arch. My arches are low, what could be better!  I immediately took advantage of a Merrill offer - and purchased another pair in another color.  I must have tried on 25 pairs of sneakers in the last three months, the Wrapt style sneaker is an oasis for my troubled feet.",

The top material is grippy but does not cause too much friction. You can transition from riding on the tops, the hoods and in the drops very well. When you rotate your hips down to sprint, the material is smooth. But it also grips when you need it. Seems pretty amazing really. Other than that, it’s super lightweight, looks cool and can fit on most regular seat posts.",

        "reviewBody": "I use a Fjallraven jacket, beanie and day pack, so believe me when I say this thing is absolute garbage.\n\n1. The backpack &apos;feature&apos; is very poorly designed - if you carry any more than a single notebook, the weight of it will pull whichever strap you take off first all the way to that side - and since there is no way to have them be even, you&apos;ll constantly be trying to make micro adjustments so it sits comfortably on your back.\n\n2.  The laptop sleeve inside doesn&apos;t go to the bottom, so if you&apos;re carrying just a laptop, it will try and collapse on itself, or fall to that side.\n\n3.  The straps in &apos;tote mode&apos; will never be even since there isn&apos;t any internal structure, so the back side will crumble up and always be slightly longer, so it&apos;s constantly sliding the shorter one off if you try and put it over your shoulder.\n\n4.  YOU CANNOT CLEAN IT.  For an outdoor product, from an outdoor company, for an everyday carry, this is trash.\n\nFor the money, you&apos;re better off buying a backpack AND a separate tote - this does both, but so poorly you&apos;ll wish you could return it.",

Its tough heavy duty waxed canvas and leather bottom are just sturdy enough to take a beating, and supple enough to fit and mold to your body. Even if you fill it, it stays close to body and won&apos;t knock into people in crowds when worn as a backpack. I use this when I am out and about for the day and want to keep my things close, but stay hands free. There is tons of room, without it becoming overwhelming.",

        "reviewBody": "It’s hard to find a ski that goes uphill this well - and is still fun and stable downhill.  At 910 grams it’s not much heavier than a full on skimo race but it would be much faster on icy or hard packed conditions.  I haven’t tried the new skin system that uses the pin hole - I just used the notch for a race type skin.  The ski has a reputation for being unforgiving but I didn’t find that to be the case and I don’t consider myself to be an expert skier.  I put a Dynafit Race 150 binding on the ski which has worked great with my Scarpa F1 LT boots.\n\nHighly recommended for citizen racing or super fast touring and both backcountry and in-area skinning and skiing.",

They cost more than my first choice selection, but promise to be waterproof, which the old ones were not at all. So far they are a decent hiking boot. They are supportive and sturdy and are more waterproof than my older Columbias. It remains to be seen how that holds up in really wet weather. I&apos;m a female but prefer men&apos;s hiking boots as they are a bit roomier so its nice this model comes in smaller sizes.",

Haven’t had a chance to wear them yet but they are easy to get on and are not stiff and clunky like some brands that I tried. Note that these boots run at least 1 size too small. I first ordered a size 7 but had to exchange for a size 8. My normal street shoes size is 6.5",

Any time I have to get down on my knees or look under my car or exercise on the floor / ground. They do the trick.\n\nMy only disappointment is that they were only offered in the largest size when I purchased recently. For my purposes, the old medium size was perfect. I plan to cut these down but I just haven&apos;t gotten around to it.",

This pad kept deflating during the night and got holes in it too easily.\n\nI needed a pad that would not get holes in it and could survive if my three year old and 18 month old children decided to be monkeys in the tent.\n\nThe RidgeRest Classic seems light and rolls up nicely into a compact shape for packing. It is made from a material that can withstand rugged conditions but is also comfortable for sleeping.",

It wraps snugly around the  jaw and cheekbones (albeit with thick padding for comfort), for a very secure fit that won&apos;t easily move backward, as compared with other helmets I tried that left a gap and did not inspire confidence in the face protector. The feel is closer to a motorcycle helmet. It was a little on the heavy side, so just not what I was looking for on local wooded trails. They had a lighter-weight version but the fit was not as good. Also, the sizing seemed peculiar in that I was an &quot;XL-XXL&quot; even though I am an &quot;L&quot; in most helmet brands.",

Zero blisters, hot spots or damaged toenails, really quite impressed as I had no issues at all. Super lightweight, comfy and adaptable, felt like a trail runner with the ankle support of a hiking boot. Only reason draw back is that they do not dry very quickly. I probably should have opted for the gor-tex option for this specific trip, however the leather is very comfy.",

Super comfortable even after 5+ miles daily on uneven cobblestone streets, and versatile enough to wear in basically any context. I have received so many compliments. First few wears yielded some blisters on my heel from the strap, but that hasn’t been a problem since. One of my favorite pairs of shoes I’ve ever bought!!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these for a trip to Italy and they have been phenomenal! We’ve been walking at least 6 miles a day and I’ve had no blisters and my feet feel fine. They do fairly well on cobblestone, but I’d recommend breaking them in a bit to soften up the strap. The traction is also pretty good, and I’ve only been slightly concerned on smooth old stone stairs when it’s raining. I wouldn’t hike in them, but they are otherwise a great activity shoe. The buckle gets easier to use after 5ish wears.",

I&apos;m heading to Europe in a month so I wanted to take one shoe that could go from day to night and was neutral - one that I didn&apos;t have to worry about breaking in. I couldn&apos;t be more thrilled with this shoe!!  Instantly it was comfortable and I&apos;ve been finding excuses to wear it everyday.  It&apos;s not super light, however it will be fine in my backpack.  The leather is soft and the shoe is very well made.  It performs well on uneven surfaces as well.  Highly recommend!!",

Sometimes I don&apos;t like when my toes peak out but the strap over the top of my foot is just perfect and comfortable. Very true to size too, so was stoked that the size I usually order was correct!\n\nI was a little nervous with the platform part being tippy, but theses are a solid foundation. I didn&apos;t feel like I was going to roll an ankle at all and some decent walking was comfortable for me!\n\nNow summer needs to arrive!",

These seemed more difficult to get the edge bead to seat in the rim than the last pair of Continental tires I had. I couldn&apos;t get these with my pump but didn&apos;t have any issues once I switched to an air compressor. Maybe it was because cold outside and the rubber was stiff. These sealed up well and seem to hold pressure better than my last set of tires. \n\nThe ride quality is good. I feel like they ride a little smoother than past tires at the same pressure. Grip seems good. \n\nOverall, I am happy with my purchase.",

        "reviewBody": "I have found that all road tubeless tires can take time to install but the Schwalbe One is easy to mount if you follow the instructions.  I use a microfiber cloth with soapy water and lube up both sides of the tire bead.  I use a AirShot tubeless tire inflator and the tire seats very easily. \n\nIf I get a hole in the tire I might have to use a Dynaplug and the Orange Sealant usually will stop the loss of air.  I usually don&apos;t have to remove the tire but I have found that if I do I can get a inner tube tire patch and patch the hole from the inside and get more miles out of the tire.\n\nThe sidewall seems to be the only weak spot that you want to avoid rocks or sharp objects that might cut it.\n\nI have ridden these tires on gravel, unintentionally, and done very well.  Didn&apos;t realize that there would be miles of a gravel section in the Mirror Lake Highway race in Utah but did it twice without any issues.\n\nGreat tires and will usually last longer than many of the other bigger brand name tires I have tried.  I usually ride over 5,000 a year so it is nice not to have to replace tires every 1,500 miles or so.",

          "I agree that these tires fit tight onto a rim, but a little bit of patience and the right tool will mount and un-mount them fine.  On the road, carry some Pedro&apos;s levers and work the bead a bit to get a tube mounted in a pinch.  I&apos;d rather they fit tight than loose obviously if running tubeless, easier to get the tire to seal and lower risk of a roll off if there is a puncture.\nAs for how the tires perform, I&apos;ve had one set mounted for 9 months with little wear, and they lasted through the fall and spring with road debris.  \nI&apos;ve mounted and used many different tires for mtb, cx, and road; I can&apos;t say these are the worse for mounting but they certainly aren&apos;t the easiest.  I find Vittoria tires to be the most difficult to be honest.  But with the right tool (don&apos;t try to mount by hand or with tire levers, use an actual mounting tool) the job is much easier."

So far I&apos;ve used it to ride her to the playground and also to haul my camping gear on a 4 day camping trip. It was heavier than panniers for the camping gear, but still worked fine. It&apos;s perfect for riding around a kid. I love how easily it folds up to put in a car. The hitch is super easy to use, and I bought an extra hitch so that we can switch it between bikes. It looks super cute and it rides so smooth I can barely feel it behind me, except going up hills. It road great on some dirt roads an even a brief bit of single track.",

Today was suppose to be its maiden voyage from MA to VT I went outside this morning, temperature was 10 degrees. Could not open the box. The key would literally not even fit into the hole. It appears they manufacture the locks out of a very soft steel and in those temps the metal must have shrunk to a point where the key would not go into the hole at all on either side. It’s 5pm now, just got home and key still won’t go in and still can’t open the box. If you plan to use this in cold weather don’t bother.",

          "Thank you for sharing your experience with the Thule Vector Alpine. \nI understand your frustrations with the operational issues the cargo carrier experienced due to low temperatures. While cold weather lock operational troubles are an inconvenience, they are not uncommon for any material operating in below-freezing temperatures. We do our best at Thule to design products that can withstand the limits of the outdoor conditions they are used in, but that does not prevent the properties of the materials used from being affected by their environments. Steel of any kind will naturally shrink in cold weather, as you noted in your review. This can occur on car door locks, as well. \nWarming up the key and mechanism prior to use can help the function of the lock. Easy ways to accomplish this include holding the key somewhere close to a source of body heat for a few minutes prior to use and breathing into the lock to warm up the tumblers. Commercial lock de-icer is also a great tool to use in these circumstances as it is designed explicitly for this purpose. \nI am sure that you will find these troubleshooting measures to be effective in using your Thule Vector Alpine in cold-weather conditions without much issue."

        "reviewBody": "I bought this bag back in 2015. I use it for work, travels (domestic/international) skiing, hiking, fourteeners, biking, rock climbing/bouldering, cruise travel and light camping (use the manta 34 for real camping). This pack I use it daily, it is my go to bag, work, fun, or travel it is very versatile and awesome. For travel, I was able to pack 4 day trip (I pack light with compress bag) easily. Comfortable straps, easy to use with all the access pocket and water bladder/pocket on the side. The bag went through a lot with me, after all this year it is still in good shape, just recently sent it in for repair/ life time guarantee. Once I get it back I re-edit this. \nShort story short this bag is fantastic for outdoor activity and hiking. It is very versatile, not water proof but definitely water resistant. Went on a few hike and got stuck in the rain storm (Colorado rain) some items in the bag were still dry but some were wet. Great material that will with stand the terrain that I put it through. Mesh bag in the front is awesome for quick access for light jacket. Trek poles/ice pick holder are great and easy to strap on and carry. Big pocket to put everything in, small inside pocket to put keys and personal item. Front small pocket to put in eyeglasses or snack for quick access. 2 pocket on the hip straps that you can put more snack, lipbalm, hand sanitizer or what ever they fit there. The straps is Snug and hold to body for activity.\nHighly recommend this bag for anyone who likes out door activity. Highly recommend this bag, after 9 years of using this almost daily, it is the first time I sent it in for repair. Can’t wait to get it back or hear from osprey about the bag.",

I was not shocked to find that there is not a lot of choices at the local shops for us fat people. There were a few other company&apos;s pack that would have worked, however you could tell it was just an after thought. I am 6 foot 7, and 360ish pounds the EF XL fits me and does not look like I am carrying an ant on my back. It has more features than the pack I used 20+ years ago and weights much less. The construction feels solid and should hold up. Again I do not know who came up with the EF idea, but I am sure I can speak for us fat people when I say thank you.",

It&apos;s perfect for an all day hike.  It holds my 3 liter bladder and two 20 oz water bottles along with a puffy, a rain shell and miscellaneous stuff like a survival knife, bear spray, bug spray, first aid kit, gloves, hat and a few sandwiches.  The hip belt pockets are nice for bars, iPhone, chapstick and small tube of sunscreen.  It&apos;s comfortable to wear and rides slightly above waistline.  The bladder is a bit of a challenge to get in and out but not a big deal in my opinion.  Overall this is a great pack, and I would buy it again and recommend it for others who want an ideal size pack for all day trips.",

However, I do travel west to snow ski each year and the sweater parka is just a little too light for me for the go to dinner / walk around &amp; shop in ski town temperatures in the US western mountains.\n\nOf course for my evening activities, I could wear my on the mountain ski jacket but I&apos;m vain and would rather be more subtle with my evening wear from what I wear on the mountain. :-)\n\nThis Expedition Pack Down Hoodie is the perfect balance of what I was looking for! I did not want to spend / did not need the features and bulk of hyper warm parka. I wanted an easy plane travel jacket and something a bit more substantial than those sweater parkas I mentioned above. Did I mention vanity? I wanted a jacket to look cool. \n \nI found this sweet spot in the Expedition Pack Down Hoodie.\n\nIt is more substantial than the sweater parkas I mentioned above. Both in down insulation and also the hood addition for those hopeful nights it is snowing at dinner which means I have to get up early for first tracks. Keeps me warmer on those evening nights without the expense of expedition gear.\n\nIt looks cool. I went with navy but regardless of the base color, I really love the subtley of the yellow in the hood pulls. I also love the logo of Fjallraven. Not gonna lie, I didn&apos;t know the Fjallraven brand until I stumbled upon the brand in a store, started my internet research, which resulted in my purchase.\n\nThis jacket will be my &quot;this is what I wear and/or stuff into my backpack for my flight from the southeast to the moutains, will be my go to dinner/walk/shop around the ski mountain town nights, wear for my depressing flight home.&quot;\n\nAnd look cool the entire trip too!",

I’m coming off three pairs of Shimano S-PHYRE’s, and this shoe is very comparable to the top of the line S-PHYRE. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would point out with this shoe is it’s very tight to your feet. But after a few adjustments and not tightening the second dial as tight, I’ve found a very comfortable median. \r\n\r\nGreat buy for the price!",

Like the S-Phyres, they now have 2 BOAs, and the carbon insert is longer. The fit is fantastic when sized properly, with no excess material. My previous shoes were a 1/2 size too small (46.5 on the European sizing scale, like what I wore in SIDI). The shape was great just no room for my foot to expand. Stepping it up the 1/2 size to 47.0 on these did the trick and I wish I had done it sooner.",

        "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s be honest.  This is a durable canvas jacket in the mold of Carhartt that will be purchased by people who may not be in a trade, but want the look (myself included).  The most work this sees is bringing in firewood from outside.  I purchased the carbon color because I wanted something a little different than your typical brown and very happy with it.\nHere&apos;s what I really like.  Fleece interior body and quilted arms keep things generally very warm.  Canvas construction cuts down on wind penetration, as well as the elastic rear skirt.  Additional coverage on the...um... rear is big plus too.  Both interior and exterior chest pocket provides options.\nWhere I really dislike this jacket are the front pockets.  They&apos;re small and don&apos;t hold a phone well.  The pocket zippers though are the real problem.  While heavy duty, every time you put your hands in the pockets, you feel like you&apos;re cutting up the cuffs.  Leave them zipped open and it feels like a chain saw against the sleeves as your arms move back and forth.  If the opening was bigger, I wonder if it would eliminate those two issues.\nOtherwise a really nice and functional jacket.",

Two different pockets on the shoulder straps which makes it easy access for traveling. I can put hand sanitizer, phone, card or my small pocket Osmo 3 Cons: wish the shoulder straps had more padding.

For reference I am now 37 and the the old fleece is still functional but worn and elastic has seen better days. That said I am thrilled with the new fleece. It is so cozy! Be aware that it is very warm to the point of a winter coat so it isn&apos;t going to be comfortable when the house is 70. But it is awesome to toss on and head outside when the weather is 40 or less outside. My kids snuggle up with me just to feel the soft fleece. I bought a small and usually wear a small so I am happy with the sizing. I wish it had thumb holes. Otherwise its a great purchse.",

        "reviewBody": "We loved our Transporter 90L wheeled duffles and the Transporter Carry On 44L for our trip to the Galapagos and 2 weeks of fun. Thinking to increase our Transporter family, I bought the Panel Loader to match the set. Unfortunately, it is just not what we wanted. The overall capacity is fine and the built in storage against the back wall of the main compartment is fine. However, the zipper on the right hand side is stopped about 1/4 way down the side and there begins the elastic water bottle compartment. Just felt that this was too awkward to access the main compartment. I didn&apos;t like the placement of the chest straps and they are attached in place with no option to move up or down. Was hoping it would work as both an airplane backpack and a hiking backpack but it just doesn&apos;t work for either option. We will purchase another Transporter Carry on 44 and then rethink the hiking options for a travel day hike option to be stored in the main duffel. If they redesign the zipper/water bottle configuration this might be better.",

Tried to get it repaired by North Face since they say they have a 1-year warranty. However, the fine print is North Face doesn&apos;t provided shipping nor do they provided return tracking numbers. Everything is based on printing a form and you may or may not get the item repaired. Bottom line is this backpack most likely won&apos;t last a year for anyone and North Face won&apos;t stand behind the product, so I don&apos;t recommend this one.",

However in practicality... it is way too small for a middle-schooler (and he&apos;s only in 6th grade) I am not sure who could practically use this backpack as it doesn&apos;t do much for carrying around notebooks, school books nor anything else. Once he&apos;s put his required school gear in the backpack there is not room for his lunchbox or jacket. We&apos;re very disappointed with this one.",

It&apos;s more secure and easier to use then a button snap.  I also like the little air vents in the legs.  It makes a big difference\n\nSizing is a problem.\nI am always a size 30 but can wear a 29 without discomfort but some tightness.  The 30&apos;s I bought are tight and feel more like 29s to me.  I only need about 3 clicks on the belt/strap for it to be tight leaving at least 15 more clicks to go.  31 would be perfect for me yet I would never consider buying a pair of 31 pants at the store.

For resort riding I prefer a jacket with more pockets -- specifically lower on the jacket. The length was wonderful and the hood fit perfectly over a helmet without falling on the ride down. It being a Norwegian brand I would size up. I typically wear a medium in US sizes and this jacket a large fit me better.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this jacket for a hiking trip to Patagonia in November. I was very excited to try it out as I have a few down jackets but wanted to splurge and buy a nice new one for my trip, but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. I would rate it 2.5/5. \n\nI also wear it on walks in the early morning in Southern California in ~50* and it does not keep me warm unless I wear a fleece under it. i have other down jackets that keep me warm without additional layers in the same weather. \n\nPros:\n- the jacket material is buttery and feels really nice\n- the lined pockets were nice \n-lightweight and packs up very small\n\nCons:\n- very thin, this did not keep me warm at all (wore it while hiking or hanging out at the campsite at night mid 40s - mid 50s with some mild wind at times). I had to wear either a wind breaker over it or a fleece under it. \n- already some fray along the zipper. Nothing bad but I only have worn it for 2 weeks. \n- has a boxy/ baggy fit that i don’t prefer.  I am 5’3, 115lbs and I bought a small. A fleece fit underneath comfortably but there was still a ton of room. The small was very long on me.",

I like how it isn&apos;t overly puffy in that I look more like Hawaiian rolls and less like a swollen Michelin Man. It feels as though you are wearing a fashionably less dense goose down comforter and while it&apos;s great for wearing outdoors for walks in the crisp cool fall, it&apos;s also great to nap at home in. Added bonus with the partially lined pockets - they&apos;re perfect for me and my low circulation fingers.",

The fit across the top of the foot was really tight and would have made it hard to keep the sandal on as I couldn’t get my foot forward enough in it. I don’t wea wide shoes so this was surprising. I had to return them.",

I found the the Honcho in the rear to work well, the Ehnline in the rear was my least favorite but still a great tire better for long distance but not good in the jag.",

The only thing I don&apos;t understand is why the tag is so huge. They are also unique because of the tag. Its multiple tags too. Not just one. They are all together.

        "reviewBody": "Wow I was so excited when I saw the berry color, I love the contrast of the black accents. I live in the PNW and was looking for a synthetic puffy that insulates when wet that I could take hiking. \nMy package got lost in the mail for about 2 weeks so I was extra excited when it showed up on my doorstep. \nI love the extra dry feel of this type of synthetic insulation, I feel like it does a great job when it’s cold and humid. The color is beautiful in person, nice pockets, seems durable. \nAnyway tried it on over a tshirt and the shoulders and upper arms were way too tight, it restricted my movement. I’m a size 14, 38DD, and I ordered an XL. There was no way I could layer at all, and the material doesn’t stretch. \nIf you have a big chest or arms/shoulders proportionately I’d order a size up if that’s an option for you. It wasn’t an option for me so I returned this, but had it fit I would’ve been really stoked about this jacket. \nHey MH by the way when are you gunna make some extended sizes? I love y’all but I feel like literally every other outdoor gear company does this. It’s the 90s, get with it already :)",

We walked at least 6 miles a day and I was always comfortable and dry.  Finally, it was so easy to wash them in the sink and hang them to dry.  They’d be dry and ready to wear the next morning.

I used one to cover a 1/4&quot; cut on the tread of my rear tire, and rode home literally on it.  \nI screwed up a new route and got stuck riding some singletrack on my road bike.  On 30-32 Roubaix tires, so I figured I would be ok.  I had my fun, then checked the tires after and found a cut right in the center.  The casing was fine, but I knew the cut would grow and something would eventually fail.  Without a better option I slapped one of these over the cut, on the outside of the tire.  I rode over 20 miles home on it, both paved and dirt roads.  It didn&apos;t come loose or wear through.  I was shocked.  Obviously not a permanent fix, but it got me home, and that&apos;s what I needed.  They&apos;re quick, cheap, and come in a tiny package.  Definitely worth sticking a pack in your bag.",

The leg pockets are too small to fully fit my phone (Pixel 7, not exactly a huge phone), and the back ones might(?) be able to hold your keys. I never rode with them as I realized they were way too tight on me (5&apos;7, 170lbs, size medium) and wanted to return them so I could get the Varlo bibs. Chamois did feel way nicer than my typical Amazon special bibs, being a thicker and more firm, too bad I didn&apos;t get to use it. Leg grippers were also super grippy, like pull your leg hair off grippy, but I guess I&apos;d rather have too grippy than not grippy enough.",

I figured a size medium would be plenty here. I can barely pull them up my legs, and to do so makes me feel like they will be ripped. I did a ride with them and my legs felt terrible, like I was losing circulation.

I very much like the pad and the length of shorts.   I tend to like a bit of a longer length short.  The pad in particular is very comfortable.  The cut of the pad is different than Rapha or Assos.  .  No issues holding gel, iphone 13 pro or the like the pockets. \n\nOne last comment, i tend to think of these shorts more of a long distance, multi hour ride type shorts.  These are not like Rapha pro lightweight/featherweight type shorts.",

The leg cargo pockets are not very deep at all (bars fit fine, phone or banana do not). \n\nMy biggest complaint is the chamois, though. Not comfortable at all, mostly feels like there’s a rock solid dumpy down there. It tends to shift around a lot, too. So finding a comfortable seats is impossible. I cut a 40+ mile ride short because of how sore my poor perineum had become. \n\nWill stick with ASSOS from now on.",

I love my PI Pro Bibs and with the drop seat feature I thought these would be perfect.... WRONG!\n\nCompared to the Pro Bibs the legs are significantly more narrow and are tight around my calves, let alone my thighs.  Once up, they felt like tourniquets on my thighs. It was such a relief to take them off after a simple 35 mile ride. I&apos;ve tried to uploaded comparison photos of the bibs around my calves.\n\nThe drop seat is basically a pain in the ass!

For me, I got the 11-30t (weighing around ~285g) and running a standard 53/39 crank. I&apos;m able to push up 8-11% gradient hills without burning out (still a suffer effort) and speed through flats.\n\nI&apos;m pretty happy with this gear ratio so far and weight on these aren&apos;t a big issue.",
