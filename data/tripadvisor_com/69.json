Help hoist the sails, then we will shut the engine down and enjoy the quiet of our beautiful schooner cutting through the tranquil Puget Sound Waters. Enjoy a beverage as the sun sets beyond the Olympic Mountains. We may even fire our cannon to salute another amazing summer day!",

The Bay Lady is a beautiful ship, the crew is friendly, attentive & informative. I've done other harbor cruises & it's nice to not have the recorded narratives. The crew answers any questions you might have though while mingling with the guests. We were lucky to see Orcas off in the distance on this cruise. Thank you Capt. Anthony, Madison, Clark, & Nick for a lovely sunset cruise! Definitely will be back this season!"

Wir hatten dazu  einen warmen Sonnentag bei strahlend blauem Himmel. \nDer einzige Kritikpunkt: Das Boot war gut belegt. Es wäre sicherlich angenehmer gewesen mit drei bis fünf weniger Passagieren. Man saß doch sehr sehr beengt. Und auch der Platzwechsel an der Reeling gestaltete sich eher umständlich. Aber dann wäre die Tour sicherlich automatisch teurer. Trotzdem, es lohnt sich. Ich habe den Törn sehr genossen."

We were able to stop and walk around in some areas, see some of Seattle’s most famous places, learn lots of interesting history, visit a local fish shop at a marina, view Puget Sound and the City from a high overlook, and see some beautiful residential areas.  This was a great and stress free way to learn about Seattle.  Thank you, Tyler!!!"

Her expertly crafted itinerary took us through Seattle's most iconic locations with perfect timing and engaging commentary.\n\nAt Pike Place Market, Lucinda shared fascinating stories about its 1907 origins and the market's evolution while we watched the famous fish-throwing tradition. The Queen Anne Hill stop offered breathtaking city views, where she explained Seattle's great fire and subsequent rebuilding on top of the original city.\n\nThe Hiram M. Chittenden Locks provided a unique perspective on Seattle's maritime history, watching boats navigate between Puget Sound and Lake Union while learning about the ingenious fish ladder system. Lucinda's knowledge of the area's Native American heritage, logging history, and tech boom transformation was impressive.\n\nHer engaging storytelling style, attention to detail, and obvious passion for Seattle made this tour exceptional. I highly recommend booking with Lucinda for an unforgettable Seattle experience."

    "description": "If you’re going to have a cocktail in Seattle, why not have one with us in the center of the universe? Come try out some city classics and local spirits on this cocktail tour of Fremont, Seattle’s funkiest neighborhood.\n\nWhether or not you’re an aficionado, your guide will start you out with the basics, with a couple of tastes of spirits produced right here in state. We’ll then move on to full cocktails that we hope will make your taste buds sing!\n\nCocktail number one might be a Seattle classic or a creation specific to the neighborhood, its history, or its community. As you enjoy your libation, your guide will fill you in on the long history of booze in the Northwest, from the days of Prohibition to the modern-day booming cocktail scene Seattle’s become since the 90s. \n\nAlong the way, you’ll find some landmarks scattered throughout the neighborhood, seemingly out-of-place objects – including the famous Fremont Troll – that have truly defined Fremont as the “Center of the Universe”.

The tour entailed a nice walk to 3 bars where we got to try drinks based off general flavor profiles.\n\nOur guide would ask, “do you want to try something ‘tropical’ OR a ‘pick-me-up’? Something ‘strong and refreshing’ OR ‘light and floral’?” This helped my group branch out a bit into trying other kinds of cocktails we may have not otherwise ordered on our own.\n\nLee was super knowledgeable and engaging, and just did a solid job herding such a large group of rowdy guys.

We're pretty quiet people, and I was worried it was going to be awkward, but Sam was so kind, so charismatic and really really informative and inclusive. We learned so much about coffee, down to the anatomy of the bean, to history of coffee businesses in Seattle. The tour was MORE than I expected; we also learned about the history of Seattle and Capitol Hill in general, which was an awesome plus for us tourists.

    "description": "Based just 5 miles from downtown Seattle, Wind Knot Salmon Guides will make you feel like you’re on another planet. Come and explore the riches of the Puget Sound, where you’ll sail across the bays against stunning backdrops doing battle against one of the Pacific Northwest’s most prized fish – Salmon.\n\nStep aboard the 25’ Grady White Gulfstream cuddy cabin and see for yourself! This vessel can cater to up to 5 anglers or 1200 lbs and features a toilet. Bring your own drinks and snacks onboard and settle in for an exciting day of fishing.\n\nFrom May through early June, you’ll be bottom fishing these waters, while other months are strictly reserved for Salmon. Using light gear, you’ll “mooch” the waters with fresh or frozen bait. This style of fishing is suited best for physically fit anglers. ",

If you hike all the way to the falls it gets a little more strenuous at the end, but nothing too hard. It’s worth it! And Snoqualmie Falls is gorgeous. So beautiful! That part is not a hike. Just a little jaunt to the overlook. Highly recommend!"

    "description": "Visit the best of Seattle with a private guide with you every step of the way. On your private tour, you will explore the waterfront and meander through the historic Pike Market and see the world’s first Starbucks. Then, hop aboard the city’s monorail for a quick transfer a mile up the road. Here, your guide will take you through another pocket of the city’s treasures, as time allows. Your tour finishes with timed-entrance tickets to the Space Needle, where your guide will help you hop in line. Your dual-ticket also gets you entrance for the day to Chihuly Garden and Glass, which is well worth spending a large portion of your day. We suggest taking a little food break before going into the Chihuly museum, as the artwork in there is best explored at your leisure. ",

    "description": "Enjoy a small group tour to one of America's National Parks, and hike various trails in the Olympic Mountains. On your small group tour (up to 10 guests), you will be driven from Seattle on a scenic trail to the national park, where you will visit several areas of the park. Throughout the day, you will do 3-4 hikes, for a total of about 4.5 miles of gentle to moderate hiking, with as many breaks as you need. You’ll visit scenic Hurricane Ridge, one of the park’s gorgeous overlooks. On a clear day, you can see across the sound to Canada, but even on a cloudy day, there are ample opportunities to interact with the wildlife, including marmots and deer. You’ll visit Marymere Falls and Crescent Lake as well – two other favorite spots in the park. We recommend you dress in layers, and wear hiking boots (though they’re not essential). Please note: the hikes require a minimum level of fitness. You will be dropped off in central Seattle or at your hotel after about 12 hours. ",
