Yet through all this, it clings to its own unconventionality. Many of Seattle's iconic stops are included as well as some hidden gems to provide you with a real feel of this beautiful city.\n\nI highly recommend taking this tour early on in your Seattle visit in order to benefit from all the information and directions!\nAt every location, we will take a brief photo stop. The tour can be scheduled as a night tour.",

It began perfectly with an introduction, safety training, opportunity to practice, and a review of our tour. Woody was hospitable not only to us, but also fellow members of the community and he made certain that everyone, the community and those of us on the tour, were safe and comfortable at all times. His humor, knowledge of the city and surrounding areas, historical insights, and other personal attention to details made being a tourist in our home town one of the best days we have had in this beautiful city. I would highly recommend this tour not only for the fun and novelty of the experience, but also the learning, and ability to see so many wonderful sites within a mere two hour window of time while never feeling rushed. In addition, the photo opportunities Woody encouraged will make for lasting memories as will his recommendations for where we might go for dinner and or snacks. We are now big fans of piroshkies as well as the Seattle Segway tour.\nThank you Woody!"

The tour ended up being a private one and Woody took me to places that he's not normally able to take folks to.  Great way to see Seattle.  It was also the first time I'd been on a Segway and he did a good job at getting me comfortable.  The fog wasn't very cooperative, but I saw a side of Seattle I would have never seen otherwise!  Thanks Woody and Seattle by Segway for a great tour."

I got sucked in one item, he patiently repeated 5 times until I got it. \n\nHe has good experience introducing the sites of Seattle Downtown and knew well where to shoot nice photos. He helped us shoot nice photos wherever we wanted. He even waited for us while  we stopped at Space Needle to reschedule our tour. We ran out of time a little bit, but he was still smiling. \n\nEnjoy the tour, best part of Seattle is the Segway tour"

It's so peaceful flying up there. The weather was excellent as well. I was worried we wouldn't have pictures as there was NO WAY I was gonna take my phone up there with me, but for a small fee, they will take pics for you!\nHighly Recommend!"

        "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed my experience parasailing!  Although I was pretty nervous that it would be scary, it actually was beautiful and relaxing.  It is the type of activity that sounds very adventurous and difficult, but as long as you know how to sit down...you will be fine.  You can do this activity in your street clothes.  You don't have to enter the water at all.  You just slowly take off from a sitting position on the back of the boat and they land you on the back of the boat in the same position.  No skills required.  You are well strapped in too.  As long as you don't have a fear of heights, I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nOn my ride, there were about 8 of us in total and each of us (in pairs) were up in the air for a about 15-20 minutes, which I think is a sufficient amount of time.  You feel like you are higher than the space needle (which you probably aren't, but that's how it feels) and it is one of the most incredible views of Elliot Bay and the Seattle skyline I could imagine.  I went on the 7pm ride and it is gorgeous as the sun is setting.  You don't feel like you are moving particularly fast, you just feel like you are floating.  The staff were friendly and willing to answer questions during the ride.\n\nMy main critiques would be that they were a little unclear about arrival instructions.  The website told us to be there at least 15 minutes before the ride, but there was no one to be seen until the exact time the ride was supposed to start and no signage to indicate I was waiting in the right place.  Also, they offer package picture deals, but those cost extra, and I thought they were a little expensive, considering the initial trip isn't that cheap.\n\nBut overall it is truly a unique experience and something that I am very glad I can say that I did.  I would recommend it!"

It was easy to book our group online and we received great email instructions and a reminder a few days before our reservation.\nThe parasailing itself was so much fun. When we were in the air, my 10 year old son said that it was very relaxing. And I would have to agree with him. We had amazing views and a very smooth trip. Andrew and Lucas were absolutely amazing and made the experience perfect. I highly recommend parasailing with Parasail Seattle!"
