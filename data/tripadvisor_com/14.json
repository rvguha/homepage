Using your smartphone, your team will be tasked with scavenging the city for food, supplies, weapons, and shelter. The more things you find, the more points you get and more likely you are to survive. Along the way, you will be asked to do a challenge or answer a trivia question in order to be rewarded virtual weapons to ward off the zombies. The area is crawling with relentless zombies, and rival colonies are moving in. If you get too relaxed, rival colonies will take what you worked hard to find. The goal is to find all of the items in hopes that you will survive the zombie apocalypse.",

Our bar crafts signature cocktails, and we offer quality well pours. Our 'Beer and a Bump' menu pairs your favorite beer with a shot of liquor for a special price. On tap, we support our local breweries and cideries with something for everyone. Our short—but excellent!—menu features grilled sandwiches, hearty salads and house-made soups. Start off right with some mac n cheese balls or mini jalapeno & cream cheese hand pies. Gluten-free bun options are available. To quote Seattle Met, “…there are satisfying sandos of every ilk” at Uncle Eddie’s, “a please-everyone type of establishment.” Weekend Brunch focuses BISCUITS! Have them smothered with your choice of honey-butter, gravy, berries or hollandaise. Enjoy them with a pounder mimosa to toast the weekend!",

    "description": "Wacky Walks is a unique walking game. It is similar to a board game in which the power, or control shifts from one player to another, and instead of a board, you’ll be navigating the city streets with your smartphone to play. \n\nThe objective of the game is to have fun, learn some facts about the city, be a little wacky, and enjoy the company of whoever you are playing with. Wacky Walks will start out by designating who will be the first King or Queen (kind of like a Team Captain), but don’t worry, that could soon change. You’ll then go out on checkpoints throughout the city. \n\nAt each checkpoint, the players will need to answer a question about the checkpoint and the players, or “pawns” as we call them will perform a task for the King or Queen. \n\nWacky Walks is done completely on foot and usually takes about two hours to complete. But don’t worry, you won’t be alone. You’ll have a remote/virtual guide that will be available in case you get stuck.",

    "description": "Crazy Dash is a digital adventure walking tour that takes you around the city to do silly tasks and see the sights using just an app on your smartphone. These sites could range from monuments and historical markers to sculptures and other important landmarks of the city. \n\nThe objective of the Crazy Dash is to have a blast with your friends and family, explore the city, learn a little, answer questions about your checkpoints, and complete crazy challenges. \n\nAfter getting introduced to a remote guide via text message, you'll set out to 10 checkpoints around the city. At each checkpoint, you'll answer a question. Along the way, be prepared to perform crazy tasks! You won't be alone. Your remote Guide will monitor your progress  throughout the Dash. They may even give you challenges!\n",

You immediately feel like friends. His infectious energy animates the entire tour! All food-related safety precautions were in place and, of course, we got to eat some DELICIOUS donuts. I highly recommend the tour for all ages as a fun way to explore the city. I didn't find traveling by foot overly strenuous (even in the wake of a freshly healed broken ankle). Take the weather into consideration and wear a good rain jacket like a real Seattleite. Umbrellas are for tourists, only ;-)"

Great start and end, just not where you parked unless you plan better than we did. Not a very far walk back and you do end at Pike’s Place Market. A little disappointed that we didn’t visit the mochi donut bakery, but tasting them was a treat. A very well plan  we nned and eRrxecuted tour that is a little more unique and worth the time. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for some steep streets. Worth the time."

Lots of fun if you’re visiting or are being a tourist in your own town."

I have always wanted to try a VW vanagon, and after looking at many reviews and websites that rented VW and RVs, I decided to go with Black Forest Westfalia because it was a small family owned business with someone who seems to know and love his vans.  And Mike is exactly that when we met him.  Mike is great to work with and very knowledgeable about his vans.  His vans are clearly loved.  And we definitely loved our van Goldie.  She was a champ! We had so much fun.  Thanks, Mike. We will definitely go with Black Forest Westfalia and Mike and Goldie next time we are in the Pacific Northwest."

The tour was entirely in Chinese so if you do not speak the language, I would not recommend booking this tour as there is little/no translation over the course of the 8 hour tour. A lot of time spent driving around (about 4 hours) leaving little time frames to explore the 3 destinations they take you within Olympic National Park. Don't get me wrong, there were great views but I would not want others booking this trip without knowing the language barriers that are involved with this tour group/company. I would not book this type of tour again, there may be greater ease in renting a car and exploring the park on your own!!"

It means specifically for us due to Twilight saga & Grey's anatomy - very special nature and climate in Seattle.\n\nThe driver/guide is friendly too - did not have the chance to say goodbye and thanks to him though. Mated with two ladies and a Russian couple - they are interesting people :)\n\nEverything is good except for the weather.\n\nPricing should be clarified - it is a $100 trip - $35 of park entrance and $15 of ferry per person - but fortunately the ladies had free passing to allow the entire car in for free thus saving $210 in total - I don't know how the company manages this but should better take such situation into consideration in the future"

    "description": "Simply put - there is no other tour like this out of Seattle! Combine the best the Northwest has to offer in this full-day adventure: a beautiful hike in the National Park with big views of Mt. Rainier, an seasonal picnic lunch outside, and wine tastings at beloved wineries in the Yakima Valley!\n\nAt the height of summer, Mount Rainier's flower-flanked trails provide the relaxation, fresh air, and peace that only comes with a walk in a quiet, wild place. Choose from a variety of trails. Our TripAdvisor \"Hall of Fame\" guides run the only day tours permitted to explore more than a mile from the park road as the National Park is ecologically important & delicate. We're lovely & professional nature educators (not bus drivers) that have dedicated their lives to artful travel.\n\nOur all-inclusive small group day trip is limited to just 10 travelers. Sleep in a little - we'll bring coffee, tea, and pastries. We’ll bring snacks, water and sparkling water for the day. Don’t worry about a thing!",

Ranier the day you go out, but it's so beautiful out there that even without Ranier there's plenty of beauty to go around.\n\nWine was fantastic, food was fantastic, views were fantastic, company was fantastic, day was fantastic, worth every dollar."

Karen, our guide, was outstanding providing us with information and always staying ahead to make our trip enjoyable.  The picnic lunch was excellent and Karen ran ahead so that she could have it all setup for us.   And the wine tasting at 2 wineries topped off the trip nicely.  Generous pours and able to taste 6+ wines at each stop!\n\nVastly different landscapes make the driving (or rather, the ride) well worth it \n\nI would highly recommend this tour!"

This tour is a great blend of activity between hiking and wine tasting .  The views all day are amazing.  My favorite part was hiking the Natchez trail on the Pacific Crest Trail with stunning views of Mt Ranier and then a fabulous lunch with grilled chicken, pesto pasta, and broccoli salad. After, we visited 2 wineries in Yakima Valley.  Fortuity winery was so fun and educational (and the wine is delish)!  There’s plenty of snacks and drinks all day. \n\nTips: 1) you can hike in running shoes but hiking shoes might feel more stable . 2)Be mentally ready for lots of seat time in the van (several hours at time) between Mt Rainer and the wineries is about 2 hours and then returning to Seattle is about 3 hrs.  Still worth the time- such a memorable trip with a nice variety!!!"

They provided tea, coffee, hot coco and pastries at our first stop. The coffee was delicious! We then did two mini hikes (about 1 mile each) at two different locations. The hike is not rigorous although some parts are steep so just be prepared to feel the burn in those quads! After that we had a picnic style lunch and the food was delicious. We then im enjoyed sampling wine at two wineries. It was a fabulous day! Definitely my favorite part of my trip to Seattle. If you get a chance to take this tour, I highly recommend it!"

No big deal, still optimistic \n\nCoffee was made available well over 1.5 hours after our pickup and there were 8 muffins for 8 guests. They were nice muffins but we ran out of coffee. There was no tea, no fruit.  One flavor of coffee sweetener. \n\nThe mountain was gorgeously displayed as we had a perfect, clear day. But the hike was not a one mile private trail for guides. It was Naches, well over 3 hours with steep gradation.  We weren’t physically prepared and bailed at a mile. \n\nLunch wasn’t until after 1 pm and was quite good, if not inclusive of any greens. \n\nThe wineries were a long drive and we had a nice time. But we didn’t arrive home until after 9pm and there was no dinner stop (unless you were cool with the Arby’s at the Pilot gas station). \n\nWe don’t recommend and opine we would choose. A Ranier day or a winery day.  Listening to drunk millennials sing rap on the return trip was just not for us.  \n\nGuide was awesome but too distracted by front seat passenger. Trip home was harrowing."

We stopped for coffee and blueberry/banana muffins at the Federation Forest then started our van trek through Rainier National Park. For our main hike, we did some of the Pacific Crest Trail then went around Tipsoo Lake and Naches Pass. We were lucky to have a completely sunny with a high of 75 day!  Afterwards, we had a delicious meal packed by a local farm to fresh grocer. I have never had a golden beet salad so good!  The next stop would have been the Yakima Valley for wine... Unfortunately the local forest fires made that area inaccessible to tourists so we went to some local tasting rooms in Snoqualmie. Chateau Noelle and WM Grassie.  We got to sample several styles of wines from each producer and I certainly went home with a few bottles.  Our last stop was the Snoqualmie Falls.  Absolutely stunning.  After a very full day, we got dropped off and we bar hoping by 8:00.  Thanks again, Kevin!"

Our guide was Chris, very young but pretty knowledgeable, good driving skill let us feel safe. He introduced many things on the way to Rainer park, and gave us enough time to stay  at Paradise site. Thanks for Chris."
