Purchased a Large knowing that it would fit a little tight (40&quot; chest, 33&apos; waist, 153 lbs- I wear XL in the Giordano Silverline thermal jersey which I love too). Works well under a thermal long sleeve jersey or under a long sleeve base. Have ridden with it on in 45-50 degree temps. Very pleased with its performance and highly recommend.",

Extremely comfortable, disappearing after you put it on. Length is good, fit is true. I am 5&apos; 10&quot;, 175#, 40 chest, 32 waist, wearing a large. I perhaps could wear a medium but the large fits snug and is not restrictive.  As for temperature range, I have worn the base in 50 to 55 degree weather with an Assos Spring/Fall long sleeve jersey and had no core issues. I have worn in the 40&apos;s with a beefier jacket and again no issues.  I have not used this in warmer weather yet -- will have to give it a try as the company says it can pull double duty.  This has become my favorite base for cooler temps; I am getting the long sleeve version for the colder days when more arm protection is needed.",

Going into my third winter with this and it remains my favorite base layer of all time.  I also like the crew neck as it&apos;s not another layer fighting for space around the neck when bundling up with a jacket and neck warmer (or an added L/S base).  Wicking properties are excellent.\nYou&apos;ll never regret this purchase.",

I can see how their complaints of the shoe being stiff and narrow as valid. Probably wouldn’t suggest for men. But for WOMEN and as a size 43 (US 10 in women’s) with a narrow foot I think it’s a good approach shoe. The ankle can be tight if you tighten the straps but can be solved if you loosen it. Hiked 5miles on incline up and down and felt good.",

I&apos;m sorely disappointed in La Sportiva for changing the fit of one of the most beloved pieces of alpine (and everyday) footwear.\n\nIf you&apos;re considering these based on your previous experience (fit) then I DO NOT recommend. The new Evo is a bit stiffer (welcome change), but somehow La Sportiva managed to make a shoe with a sloppy heel cup and a cramped (narrow) toe box. Great for all those wide heeled, skinny toed alpinists out there.",

I didn&apos;t realize that there are two sizes because there is no indication in the description. One is sized to fit over a helmet, but this one is not, so sadly, I returned it. I have a new one now, Backcountry brand, and it is nice; it just doesn&apos;t have the same features as the Burton one.",

I started out with botties on and no problem with grip but when I tried barefoot there was nothing so looks like I&apos;ll have to start waxing it which is fine - just something to consider. other soft tops I&apos;ve used had good grip for barefoot....",

I used this primarily for backcountry ski days and did the Grand Traverse in them. I like the side vents as my legs sweat but I cut out the mesh in the middle for better breathabiity. I also removed the suspenders. The waste band straps for tightness are velcro and while they hold decently well, it feels like the waste has stretched out over the season.",

Another plus for them being mesh, nothing falls into them. I run quite warm, so they are fantastic for skinning &amp; approaches.\n\nCalf cuffs are well thought out. Was very happy with how tight they can be synched down for climbing. I used to wear one pair of pants for climbing, one for skiing - these handle both quite well.\n\nhttps://vpo.ca/topic/VPO.Content.Bottoms.M.Mammut?contentonly=true\n\nStudy this fit chart and take your measurements. Normally a 35-36 inch waist gives me the room I need for my gigantic ass &amp; thighs. 38 inch waist was perfect for those areas. Unfortunately, they won&apos;t stay on my waist without without the suspenders, but that&apos;s more of a me issue - not design. Recommend sizing up if you are in doubt",

        "reviewBody": "Yep it happened! I’m so paranoid about my dogs health and safety that I purchased the Airlift in medium for my 50 pound Cattle Dog crossbreed. At 2 years old she is an avid experienced hiker. While hiking we ran across a Western Diamond Back Rattlesnake in a rock outcropping. It’s rattle was faint then not when it struck at me. I was able to stumble out of the way and not get bitten myself but my dog, who had already cleared the area off leash came back and got between me and the snake. She got nailed! We both got clear of the snake and I examined her. She was bitten on the right jaw. I administered a gelcap Benadryl and water, excitedly deployed the Airlift system got her into it and on my back (we had previously practiced) and my 15 pound daypack onto my chest and hiked up 1.5 miles gaining around 1000 feet of elevation. Walked about another mile on a road where we flagged a truck who took us to my car. We live just below where we were hiking so I was able to get her to the Emergency Veterinary Hospital in just a little over 2 hours from being bitten. I’m not a big strong guy. No way I carry a 50 pound dog 4+ miles (without the ride). But I did carry her 2.5 miles+ with the system and that’s what I’m focusing on. I believe the Airlift system is the reason she survived! And, of course, the fantastic Emergency Vets and 4 vials of anti venom. If you hike with a dog you need this system. The cost is nothing compared to the life of your 4 legged companion and friend!!",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this to help carry our old girl (65lb lab) up and down stairs. She was very calm, but it seemed to hurt her back and hips, and she cried out when being picked up. It didn’t seem like it balanced her weight well, and didn’t seem very secure. We tried several different methods. It was easier on her just to carry her. We have a small portable litter for hiking.  It is heavy for backpacking, and requires 2 people to haul a dog, but it works better than this sling for our situation. Because of her age, we aren’t backpacking too far, so I’m sure it would work on a younger dog, but I’m unsure if they had an injury (unless just an extremity) how it would be tolerated.",

        "reviewBody": "Purchased this prior to backcountry carrying the product, and I tried a couple different sizes before I found the right one for my pup (65lb GSD-Lab-Pit mix), and ended up with the XL size, because her body is long(ish) and the  M/L sizes were pulling her legs forwards and back and seemed to be missing support on the front/back ends. Consequently I had to alter/sew the sling myself to make it the right size (since was too big in other dimensions) and I had to shorten/change the location of the lifting straps and chest strap because I am 5&apos;2&quot; and even at the shortest dimensions all around she was basically sitting below my lower back curve (which is where the dog needs to fit into in order to carry them for any distance) as well as running into my legs.  There is no way that I could carry her for a long time over very rough terrain, but it at least provides some help to get to a better place, and hopefully I could find others in the process if I am otherwise solo. Definitely practice with it and realize that there is going to be a fair amount of strenght required, especially if your dog is heavier.",

It was a lot of work but without the sling, there’s no way I would have been able to carry him. I would suggest buying the shoulder padding if you have a large dog.

Our dog is close to 90 pounds! For me it’s too much weight to carry for a long period but I still carry the Airlift with me so I have a tool to solicit help from others with. My boyfriend can carry our dog confidently over rough terrain and actually had to use the airlift a few months ago when our dog got a bad cactus thorn wedged in his paw! The Airlift worked well. My boyfriend was pretty exhausted when he got home but got our baby home safe for a little paw cleaning and thorn removal. We have the size XL.  5 stars ALL the WAY! Great product!",

As an avid solo backpacker regularly playing in the Rockies with large dogs, it was due time to invest in a product that would help in an unfortunate emergency. I am grateful we tried this out beforehand to know it’s useless for my body. As a once female collegiate basketball player and consistent weightlifter, there is no way-even with adrenaline-I would be able to lift my dog from a kneeling position to then being on one knee to standing. I ordered a medium which was well within the weight limits of our puppers (60 lbs). Even with my spouse’s help, the lift wasn’t possible. Only males are featured on the available product images; however, I don’t know a female or male in our network that could make this lift for a larger dog. Additionally, the straps dig in to your shoulders (skin scraping) but it seems inconsiderate to charge an additional $25 for ONE shoulder pad rather than include the padding to help an owner in a distressing situation. TLDR: not for the average person, not for large dogs, strap upgrade is nickel and diming the consumer, it is compact and packable, will be returning and continuing the search.",

The loose fit is perfect for that. It will go well with a range of different outfits. The winter green color is exactly as pictured, a slightly muted true green. The sleeves are long and loose, and I like that I can easily roll them for a slightly different look. It is also pretty wrinkle resistent, making it a great for travel!",

        "reviewBody": "This is the worst designed seat post clamp ever.  I should have taken the warning from my LBS seriously.  My LBS would not even take the time to put on.  They said too much of a PIA.  They were right. It requires two people to get a saddle attached.  Finally got one but I took back off. Going to return it. I don?t want a seat post that required this much effort.",

        "comment": [
          "I have the carbon WCS One-Bolt version with a zero offset. Coming from a 3T Doric seatpost where I had to adjust two separate screws independently of each other in order to affect the proper tilt angle (i.e. making one bolt tighter than the other), this seatpost is one of the easiest seatpost I&apos;ve ever encountered. It took literally no effort to install by myself and it hasn&apos;t slipped in the last 500 miles. Make sure you have the proper clamp for your rail system (round vs. oval rails), use carbon paste as necessary, and loosely install the clamping mechanism onto the saddle rails while the saddle is off the bike. As the clamp isn&apos;t tight, you can then slide the clamp/saddle assembly onto the semi-circular head from either the front or the rear. Sliding the clamp/saddle fore and aft will impart the desired angle. From here, just torque the single bolt to 12 N-m. It couldn&apos;t be any easier and a second person would just get in the way.",
          "I have the alloy version of this seatpost and really like it.   I found it relatively easy to fit my saddle to the post and once all of the pieces are in place, it is very easy to position the saddle.  One bolt and it is easily accessible.  I would suggest assembling the saddle to the post with the post removed from your frame.  I can see how it would be a little tricky to put the post in the frame first.",
          "I have two of these posts. Yes, they can be tricky to mount, but by backing out the mount screw to the very edge, I was able to slide the seat into the mount front first and get it into the rail mounts. I love this seat post. Once the saddle is on, it is infinitely adjustable and it is lighter than anything else you can find at the $200 price point."

Due to the Lining being wool and super plush, THEY WIL BE TIGHT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON FOR THE FIRST TIME. They WILL STRETCH OUT THE MORE YOU WEAR THEM. SO please, save yourself the sadness and loss of money and get they tighter fit. They were pretty tight upon trying them on, the toe box and heel were very snug. I am usually a 6.5 or 7 in women&apos;s. But Uggs does not make half sizes. So I went with the size 6 and I am so glad that I did. After wearing them for 2 hours around the house after treating them, they molded to my feet and fit perfect.",

Here&apos;s a list of my pros and cons.\n\nPros: \n- Comfort... super super comfy and soft, not a scratchy wool by any means\n- Material... my feet run hot by design but since these are wool, I don&apos;t get the stink I would get out of another lined slipper\n-  Durability... I wear these to work at the Boulder shop all the time, throw em&apos; on for apres, and toss them around and they haven&apos;t shown any points of weakness\n- Fit... true to size of a normal burk. I normally wear a 10.5/11 shoe and I got these in a 43. Don&apos;t have to deal with poking holes in the straps because the wool holds its shape :) \n\nCons: \n- The only con is that these do not have the super thick cork base that you get from a normal burk. That said, I wouldn&apos;t count on the orthopedic benefits that your typical burk provides. \n\nOverall, the Zermatts are a stylish + comfy way to keep the house cleaner, drive back from the resort, or throw on for some errands!",

The speed feature is far from perfect since it currently can only be paired with the trainer, and that machine doesn’t actually know your virtual speed. Instead it relies on cadence so if you’re going downhill in Zwift for instance, the second you stop pedaling the fan thinks you’ve stopped. \n\nIt would be better if the fan could be paired with the training app you’re using and could pull speed from there.",

This backpack can be used like a briefcase, backpack, or as a carry-on that slides into your suitcase.  It’s perfect!\nWhen I received the bag, I initially felt disappointed because it was setup in its briefcase format, and i did not see the backpack straps.  When I realized the straps were tucked away in the back zipper compartment, I was happy again!\nI’m a small female (5’0), so finding a bag that doesn’t overwhelm my frame is important.  This bag is the perfect size.  Not too big, not too small.  It also looks good on my partner; who is 16 inches taller than me.\nThere is plenty of room in this bag for my laptop, docking station, 184747 million cords, and various chargers on one side and a small bag with personal hygiene necessities on the other side.  For fun, I folded up a small outfit and was able to fit that in the bag with everything else.  If you are a gifted packer or you have a small bag of essentials and clothes, you can take that as well!  My partner said he would easily be able to fit hygiene items and a dress shirt in the bag in addition to work/computer items.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;m fairly petite and often find backpacks are too big for me...this pack fits great (I ordered a couple different packs and this is the one I kept). I specifically bought it for a trip to Europe to use on the plane and when out and about. It fit everything I needed and I appreciated the multiple pockets for organizing. Only one of the side pockets will hold a water bottle since one is too short (24oz owala fit perfect, 32oz hydro flask was a tighter fit). I liked how the zippers for the largest two compartments could hide behind the water bottle to be less conspicuous while traveling and I was also able to use a small cable lock on them. My 15&quot; hp laptop doesn&apos;t fit in the laptop pocket inside the pack, but does fit loose in the main compartment.",

I find that the mid strap is not needed when the velcro and hook is in use, but I love that the strap is an option.

There is a minimalist brand of gaiters popular with trail runners -- these are like them but more coverage, and more versatile with the strap and adjustment options. My only nitpick would be that the solid black version looks great, but the multi-colored options are not for me.",

Looking at these on their own, I like the ankle elastic. The light colored fabric in the front dirt stained with the first use. The understrap worked well in the scree and rocks, but was almost impossible to get off at the end of the day. Now I know why so many people broke the cording- they had to to get their shoes off. The overdone hook that &quot;locks&quot; onto the cord is totally unnecessary, I had to turn into a contortionist to flip it totally on its side just to unhook it. There is no getting your shoe off until that strap comes off! O/R needs to change the velcro to have the hook side on the fabric! Guy&apos;s, with the hook side on the shoe it will fill up with debri and dirt and not function (didn&apos;t anyone test this?). I &quot;fixed&quot; my pair. All my shoes have the &quot;soft&quot; patch on them and I have never had a problem that way. The O/R way, everyone has a problem with them. All in All, after having to file down the hooks to make them useable and reversing the velcro these will work just fine, but why should I have to remake them when it would have been so easy to start with?",

The diamond knit of the fabric completely closed up and the seams have bunched up into ribbons. I&apos;ve never had any problems washing merino wool garments so this was an unfortunate surprise.\n\nMy baselayer is completely ruined which is a huge dissapointment. DO NOT BUY THIS without understanding this piece of information. The tags say to handwash and hang dry so if that&apos;s something you&apos;re up for then go for it because it&apos;s truly a great piece of clothing.",

I ordered an XL and this is 5-6&quot; shorter in the torso than a 10 year old Craft of similar use.  It is a trend we all need to be aware of.  Solid Castelli quality, but sizing is nowhere near what other brands are running.  As a reference, CC had me purchase a 2XL long sleeve winter jersey and its PERFECT.  ***I am 5&apos;10&quot; and weight 180-185 with a swimmer build as your reference",

I do high-output hikes/runs that last anywhere from 1-8 hours. This jacket compresses enough that I&apos;ll bring it along every time.  It breathes better than the Patagonia Houdini that I used once and found to be quite clammy.  I haven&apos;t been caught out in any unexpected weather, yet, but I&apos;d expect the softshell fabric to offer enough protection in clouds, fog, or a light drizzle. It is pretty expensive, as is most of the stuff I buy from Black Diamond.  But their stuff just works for me, and is very much worth the price (loyal Black Diamond customer for over 30 years).",

Depending on fit, YMMV and prefer the S23. \n\nAlso, MSRP is $25 too expensive for what the garment offers. \n\nLove it for for ski touring, running and packable travel. Use it more than my less breathable more wind resistant lighter weight peers on the shelf (Houdini, Squamish, etc). However, when venturing into the alpine find myself more confident in wind/wet weather resistance of LTW shells like Distance &amp; Squamish",

The fit and inseam length are great, with the shorts staying put while in motion - no creeping up the thighs or backside. The waistband is narrow and uncomfortably tight. I am thinking of cutting a slit in the side of elastic to see if it will be more comfortable. I am 5&apos;1&quot; and 110lbs with athletic thighs. I tried on both the S &amp; XS, and kept the XS as the S were too large / droopy for me.",

I pried to fluff it up, but I was very disappointed at how thin the insulation is. Saying that there is insulation on the top of this is an overstatement, as you can see from the attached pictures. NO INSULATION AT ALL. Maybe there was a manufacturing issue. I would only feel comfortable sleeping in this bag if it was 70° outside.",

I love: the fit, straps are minimal but fit well and breath well, I removed the waist belt and yet that pack stays nicely put while I’m riding, the profile is low and sleek without unnecessary extra straps and dangling things. \r\nIt’s simple and it’s small, it’s a “small” 10l bag, other manufacturers would probably rate this as a slightly smaller volume. This works for me as I don’t want a massive bag on me when I’m on my road bike, I can fit a change of clothes, bike kit and a few extra things but I’m constrained to the essentials. Side pockets can easily fit snacks and a bike water bottle. \r\nThis pack is crazy lite weight, another massive +. \r\nI have left off a star as the colour is fading (I bought the pack in red and it’s starting to show its age) i have washed it a couple of time on gentle (against instructions, it says “don’t wash”!?) and that might be partly responsible but it looks like UV fading, I ride with it a lot in the summer. Not a deal breaker for me, it’s well used and well loved, awesome kit!",

        "reviewBody": "So I picked this up mainly as a fashion piece to complete the Enve Aero cockpit, which is silly, but I figured why not. So it looks great, but I really had no expectations as far as improving ride quality.\n\nFirst off, it&apos;s stiff. Is it stiffer than a basic aluminum stem? Hard telling, but I have a pretty strong sprint and it feels super solid. For $300, that&apos;s a reasonable expectation for a stem.\n\nThe surprise was how much chatter it cut out. I usually struggle with numbness in my hands on long stretches of chip seal and other buzzy surfaces, but it completely cut it out. I can&apos;t say enough about how much it smoothed out my ride.\n\nAlso, the flexibility in fit adjustments allow you to set a more aggressive stem angle and add another spacer, which might make the bike easier to sell in the future with a bit of extra length on the steerer tube (unless you&apos;re rocking the slammed stem with the -17° shim).",

The fabric also feels soft and nice, not too thin and not too thick, however the fit is problematic. I am 5&apos;4 130 pounds and I bought a small which is my regular size in yoga pants across brands. When I initially tried them on they seemed to fit fine, so I removed the tags and wore them. They kept sagging in the crotch and I had to pull them up to my bra line trying to keep them hiked up. The crotch area also fit tightly to the body so it kind of billows out around the area of the front thigh crevice. I am constantly needing to hike them up. I would have exchanged for an X-Small if I hadn&apos;t removed the tags. It doesn&apos;t seem there would be a size small enough for a very petite woman.",

My husband and I were amazed at the difference in size when you hold up the XL in this pant, vs the XL in the jumpsuit. It doesn&apos;t dig into my waist, though, and the colors and fabric are luxurious. I hope the inner thigh seam doesn&apos;t pill and pin-hole through from the stress the seams are taking. I have no problems with the jumpsuit I bought, but like I said, these are not as roomy as the legs of the XL jumpsuit. Despite the stretch, it doesn&apos;t appear to be straining the fabric at first wear. I bent over, and my husband couldn&apos;t see any thinning in the fabric. I&apos;ll keep them, just get a 1X in the regular tights if I reorder, because if they&apos;re that tight and thick, the 1X isn&apos;t going to be loose or baggy; it&apos;ll just have more material and put less stress on the seams.",

The Pad, look confortable but the front side is not  well done,  always bothers  me, is not  confortable in the front, almost close to make  a injure!. And the reason to  buy it: drop-tail bib...careful doesn´t   work  well, the competitors bibs are much much better and well designed.. Really  sad, because   I had use a lot of Castelli bibs for mtb endurance races  and never had a problem, but this  model  is not working well at least   for  gravel rides 40 miles or more. And now a days  we deserve just designs with drop tail but  well done!!!. Usually   I think  they and Castelli   have the  best pads, but in this model is particularly uncomfortable in the front.",

This is my second pair of these shorts. I had the same thing happen to my first pair after about a year. I hoped it was a one off problem but it is not. If you know your way around a sewing machine you can fix the problem, but it shouldn’t come to that",

Absorbed so much road chatter and was very very comfortable. The sizing is unfortunate. I ordered the XL and they fit great, but my normal size is M-L in other areas of clothing. The cargo pocket is pretty nice, very secure.",

        "reviewBody": "The idea of an integrated sleeping pad really intrigued me, so I took the plunge and purchased the Insulated Cot 1.  Problem: the cot failed to self-inflate even after 24 hours leaving the inflation port open (and deflation port closed).  I was able to inflate it, with some effort, using a Sea-to-Summit inflation bag.  Left it overnight to allow the foam to expand, then deflated the pad and tried the self-inflation routine again.  Nope, didn&apos;t fill up after another full 24 hours.  I tried pressing on the inflation valve, as shown on the image next to the valve.  That ended up dislodging the valve flap, which disappeared inside the mat.   That&apos;s not the performance I expected from a $500 piece of camping gear.  Thankfully,  the Backcountry rep (Samuel E.) I chatted with did a wonderful job arranging an exchange that&apos;s supposed to arrive in time for an upcoming trip.  I&apos;ll refine my review after testing out the replacement.  Fingers crossed, &apos;cuz this bit of gear could be a game changer........or not.",

Another good kindle is cotton ball covered in vaseline. \n\nI like that it’s compact,lite and the striker is tethered. I used this when I went to Northern Nevada,Utah,Idaho,Montana and Wyoming. Especially came in handy in Idaho when it snowed in the middle of June!! Started many fires and also my backpack stove. This is an item I highly recommend. \n\nI have other msr equipment and been very happy with the quality of msr products. In fact I still have the alpine kitchen set since 2001. I’ve added a msr plate and cooking pan to the alpine set and all nestle together and fit in the carry sack. I also bought a msr fork, spoon and knife to take when I go backpacking, hunting and camping.",

I cut the tags and hung it outside in sunlight for 24 hours, then brought it to the laundry room. It made my entire laundry room smell Immediately like the garmin dye process, or like a mattress off -gassing. I could not believe it. I washed it in a hot cycle with vinegar, hung to dry. Stilled smelled. Washed again with oxi clean. Still smelled, still put it outside. Even upon ironing it steamed this strange fowl odor. It’s in the closet hanging up now, and for the life of me I still don’t know why a $98 dollar denim shirt would be giving off so much of a strange toxic like odor. Disappointed experience will not purchase Howler Products in the future. My other garments from my order where normal.",

It did not have instructions, the online videos were crystal clear and it was easy to install. As for function, I love how its &quot;rebound&quot; is the perfect speed - not too fast as my old one. It has been working flawlessly. Fixed attachment point at the collar rather than at the seatpost clamp (like my old Specialized Command Post) is a plus.",

        "reviewBody": "You can’t don and doff these full zip pants with both feet on the ground. You can’t don and doff these pants while keeping skis on, crampons on, or boots on. All because the end of both zippers are closed. Even if just one end of one zipper was open (like the main zip on the parka) this would all be possible and you could don these at a moments notice. I don’t know if this is a critical oversight or misguided design. It is very unfortunate that a small choice (a millimeter sized area) had such a large impact on functionality, on an otherwise well made and well designed garment. \n\nFor those having trouble visualizing without owning the pants, there are 6 zippers, you can move them all to the end of one pant leg (where the cuff remains closed and won’t accept a boot), all to the other pant leg (same), all to the top mid back where’d you’d have to try to climb in to the pants on the ground from the suspender side, or anywhere in between. There are always zips holding the two sides closed, despite the garment being one piece anyway, no matter where you move the zips. This inability for the zipper to detach at least at one end is what prevents these from being put on like a jacket and zipped up in place boots and all. Full zip pants without full zip functionality.",

But the ability to open them and ventilate them it’s really great when you start working hard on the steep uphills.  I haven’t had to put a shell over them and they seem to block wind well with a matching jacket on I’ve been in windchill temps below -40 and been really comfortable.",

        "reviewBody": "The Absolute Zero Pants are exactly what I wanted for winter around Fairbanks, Alaska. We experience lower than -50°F with wind chill and therefore I was looking for expedition pants. The pants feature extremely dip pockets, the picture measures almost 13in which is deep enough for my expedition mittens. Additionally being able to zip open the rear is extremely useful when trying to use the restroom, especially in a dry cabin with no heat. The bib upper is comfortable and has two chest pockets big enough for your phone, batteries and snacks. The front two way zipper opens all the way. The back has six two way zippers that can be used to open the seat, undo the leg from the bottom to put the pants on and have a side vent open to release heat. At first the zippers are a little confusing since you first see four zippers all bunched up together and one zipper on each hem of the legs. You just need to practice to get familiar with the zippers. The velcro adjustable hems are not necessary for my double boots, but if you have smaller boots you can make it tighter. Even thought it is elastic and it also features two holes if you want to tie a cord to act as a boot gaiter and prevent the hem from rising in deep snow. Last winter, before I had these pants, I tried dry tooling (climbing with axes and crampons on rock free of ice/snow) at -30°F and I was extremely cold from my legs while wearing synthetic belay pants. That’s when I realized I needed some serious expedition pants. I am excited to use the Absolute Zero Pants for the first time this winter and have no doubt they will withstand the coldest temperatures I’ve experienced in Alaska.",

Around my belly at the widest point I&apos;m 40&quot;, and when I zip these up, they are comfortably snug ( I&apos;m also packing an extra 5 or 10 lbs at the moment) They are super light and very well constructed. Good zippers. The chest packets are small, the front pockets are roomier an more useful. Suspenders are well constructed. I received these in summer so I can&apos;t attest to warmth, but walking around in my back yard, I can tell you they are easy to walk in, and afford a full range of motion. Judging by the loft, I&apos;m pretty confident they&apos;ll be very warm.",

So, I wore them for a few days, and they felt OK.\nOn my hike they started to hurt in the heel after the first mile. It got worse as the trail steepened. After about 5 miles my heels were blistered and popped.  I pushed on as to not hold up my group. It was great to start going downhill and take the pressure off my heel. After about a mile my toes were blistering. I used moleskin, but it was no help. I finished slow and now I don&apos;t even dare put them back on after it took over a week to heal.\nThese were a bad choice that I regret.",

They are super comfortable right out of the box, lightweight, and waterproof. Great for hiking and walking the dog. Five star rating for that. Unfortunately, in my case, the rubber soles wear down to nothing in just a few months of wearing them two or three hours a day. The stitching and everything is great, but there’s no tread left. If Columbia could make them last longer it would be a major improvement and I wouldn’t be looking at other brands.",

Excellent fit (really best fit of a hiking boot I have ever had) and kept my feet warm through the winter even during subzero temps. Walking a puppy 4 to 5 times a day, comfort is key and with having wider than normal feet, the fact these come WIDE is a HUGE plus. Soles lasted about 360 miles with half that walking in sand so typical range of at the price point and still usable. Definitely buying another pair soon.",
