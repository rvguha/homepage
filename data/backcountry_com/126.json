It was easy to see why they were Yeti&apos;s #1 selling women&apos;s short. Then they changed the design and material. The short is longer by a good inch and the material seems lighter -- or perhaps it&apos;s cut differently. Seems like there&apos;s a lot of material. I always order an &quot;M&quot; so I don&apos;t feel restricted with a bike liner, but these felt too big in all the wrong places. Sadly, I&apos;m done with Yeti for the time-being.",

You get it! \nThey took a bit to get used to in terms of where the straps sat and rubbed on the feet but my feet feel supported, can&apos;t feel rocks and are very grippy even in the water.\nUnfortunately on my recent sea kayaking trip the Vibram sole has started to come off. Simple glue fix but wasn&apos;t expecting this to happen.",

It is a lovely warm fleece inside and a nice cotton on the outside. Buttons are lovely and big. I ordered a medium and the fit is good for me. Sleeves are just about long enough but I do have long arms. Only reason I gave it a 4 is because there is no little Ariat tag on the outside, like a little tad, I know that sounds odd but I like those little touches that is why I love Ariat so much. You could put a little tshirt underneath too",

The backpack straps are sturdy, and it’s nice to be able to put them away.",

The multiple grab handles and tough material on the bottom makes it great for sliding around the bed of your truck or at the base of your crag. Though the handles are tough enough to carry it with just one, you aren&apos;t able to use two handles at a time for a side carry like most travel duffels. Otherwise, the shoulder straps are easy to attach for a comfortable carry, and it&apos;s nice to have a dedicated pocket so they aren&apos;t getting misplaced when not in use!",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marmot has a long history of making high quality outerwear. And this history continues with Mitre peak Jacket. I have been a fan of Marmot since my first jacket (the Alpine Light Jacket) which has been with me for most of my outdoor adventures into the backcountry and high altitude peak. I still remember when the 10,000 meter parka was the one of the best pieces of equipment a mountaineer could have for protection at very cold, high altitudes. Not sure if they still make that. Back to the review of this jacket. I like the fact that it is does not come with a liner so this makes it more versatile for layer. Not sure of the durability for and longevity as the material is lighter and therefor repeated use with pack straps and harnesses may wear stress areas out as they are not reinforced. I have yet to find rainy enough day where the jacket has not performed. Hopefully this waterproofing with continue over the life time of the jacket. My biggest issue now with the latest products from all makers (Patagonia, The North Face, etc) is the delamination of the gortex material after a few years of use. Hopefully they have resolved this issue. Looking forward to many years of use with this jacket. Check in with me in a few years, I will let you know how this performed",

The waist is just too tight, for reference I&apos;m 5&apos;11&quot; 180 lbs with a 34 waist. The medium fits great in the sleeves, shoulders and chest but it is tight around the hips. Yes there is a 2nd zipper to zip up at the bottom to loosen it up but there I&apos;m worried about putting too much pressure on the zipper when being active and damaging it. \nOther than the hips, it fit great, the hood is large to fit over a helmet but the adjustment works very well when not wearing one. The neck zips up nice and high to protect chin from the wind and all zippers are smooth and waterproof. Material felt high quality. Bummed to return it.",

It is taken in and out of my backpack quite a bit. It sheds water well and keeps me dry when I have it on which would bode well for more extreme conditions.\r\n\r\nMy major concern is that despite not using it much, there is already a small hole on the inside of the jacket in one of the pockets, and it looks like there might be a couple more spots where holes will appear soon. Not sure if I got a dud given other positive reviews, though. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve snagged the jacket anywhere, and if I did, it would have been significantly less severe than anything it would likely experience outdoors.",

Needless to say I was quite comfortable with this Jacket and really enjoyed watching the heavy precipitation literally shedding off this Goretex jacket like “water off a ducks back.”\r\nPacks down small and doesn’t weigh much which was an added bonus for the backpacking trip around the mountains here. A must have for any serious outdoor enthusiasts who want to stay dry on their next outing.",

The disadvantage that made me return it, is that the insulation in the upper central part/ covering is free, it isn&apos;t sewn and I&apos;m afraid that after few usages will fall apart. But it&apos;s mine opinion. The zip is brilliant. The sleeping bag looks very good but I haven&apos;t tested it because decided to return it. It looks not enough durable but it is not that heavy as others synthetic bags on the market for this temperature range.",

It rolled fast, gripped well, and has not suffered any damage despite being subject to many rocky, ledgy drops and some rockier mountain bike trails.\n\nIt was pretty easy to mount on a FSA Vision Trimax 30 rim with a compressor to seat the bead.\n\nI don&apos;t know what this other person was talking about as far as sandy jeep roads go the White Rim consists largely of sandy jeep roads and this tire worked great in areas other than super deep sand and climbs too steep and sandy to ride anyway. I did not notice any issues with grip on the climbs.\n\nThe center tread is pretty &quot;slick&quot; but I wouldn&apos;t say they slip on climbs anymore than any other knobby mountain bike tire would slip on a steeper climb.",

Now that I&apos;ve turned 40 and going on my 37th season skiing (most of which we didn&apos;t wear helmets) I thought I would treat myself to something a little better quality, feel  and fit. \n\nI did have to size down on Nexus helmet as it seems to run a bit larger that the Maze.  I could have gotten away with a large, specially with the BOA feature, however the Medium fits perfect!",

Great integration with my Smith goggles, which never fog. Had an issue with a previous Smith helmet with the goggle retainer getting too stretched. It looks like the goggle retainer on the Nexus is not replaceable (which I find odd, as that is a high warranty issue. Had to remove foam from the earpiece to get music speakers to fit. Even doing that, the fit was pretty snug (same size as old helmet). But after a couple weeks, I have either adapted or it has packed out a little. I like the magnetic buckle. Light, but not the lightest helmet out there. Expensive, but my head is worth it.",

I can literally see through it in a brightly lit room. If I had any complaints it&apos;s just that the cut is not very flattering and the sleeve cuffs are too big. The elastic isn&apos;t very elastic. There&apos;s definitely about an inch or more of open space there... That being said for what it is the jacket is surprisingly warm enough for my needs . I&apos;ve worn it down to -3c so far and been warm with a light sweater under it.",

The jacket version I wear a Medium, but the Medium in this parka was a little too roomy for what I wanted, so I returned for the Small.  I am 5&apos;4, 132 and 36C.  The bust area is a little more close when zipped, so I won&apos;t be wearing anything thick under it.  But it&apos;s the right size for my needs, wanted an everyday longer coat that&apos;s not bulky.  These Ghost Whisperers are the best ever for lightweight (like air) and I find them very hardy (warm, and can take a lot of wear and tear).  I bought the &quot;Glacial&quot; colour and it&apos;s exactly like photo.  Hope this helps.  A happy Mountain Hardwear customer.",

You are able to feel the comtours of the rock under your foot.  Grip is fully adequate.  Durability is moderate.  Weight is excellent for a mid priced shoe.   The only disadvantage is that the shoe will not protect your foot and dont even try to crack climb in these babies.",

The Sherpa lining is incredibly soft and keeps my boy warm without being too bulky. I love the full-zip design, which makes it easy to adjust based on the temperature, and the zippered pockets are perfect for securely holding my son phone and small toys. It’s durable and stylish, and I’ve worn it for both outdoor activities and casual outings. Highly recommend it for anyone needing a reliable, comfortable shirt for chilly days!",

The fit is exactly the same as the 6.1 Heat sock - the difference is in the cheaper material (more polyester/less wool). Additionally, the cheaper fabric makes the top of the sock (where the heating element strip is) more lumpy and therefore less comfortable. The Lenz heated sock is a great product - spend the extra $ for the better material in the 6.1",

The deal breaker is that the tongue of the boot is removable and secured only to the boot by velcro.  It’s padding does not taper toward the toe causing a wired bulge and potential issue.  It is unfortunate as these boots otherwise are great and the other changes are positive like the capped toe.",

I have a rough time with getting proper sleep and decompressing before bed. This device is perfect for helping with that and also keeping a good track of how it&apos;s been helping you. You can connect the device to the Therabody app and control the device from there + your progress in terms of heart rate at the beginning/ end of usage. There are 3 levels to the heat and 3 different types of modes (Relax, Sleep, Focus). The app also comes with audio in case you want that with any of your modes. The device is one of the more expensive ones on the market, but it&apos;s well worth it if you are consistent with your use!",

        "reviewBody": "This is my second pair of Salomons after the first pair would not fit right and had issues with the tounge constantly falling out of place, causing discomfort. I switched to these shoes and found them opposite of the last shoes. These were too tight, leading my toes to bunch up against each other - which led to massive blisters while hiking. These do seem to provide decent support, but finding a pair that will actually fit you may be challenging. They are quite airy, which can be a good thing, but leaves them on the colder side when it&apos;s cold outside. They seem to be primarily plastic and the soles haven&apos;t held up well after roughly 200 miles walked in them. Compared to my cheaper shoes from another backcountry/outdoor company, these leave a lot to hope for. I am nothing but disappointed in the Salomon brand and don&apos;t want to continue wearing these after trying over and over again to like them. While most people I know that love them state it takes a while to like them, I think over 200 miles and still getting blisters is beyond enough time. While I&apos;m sure Salomon&apos;s are good for some, they are terrible for me and I&apos;ll never consider the brand again. \r\n\r\nThat said, this shoe does not have the same issue with the tounge of the shoe sliding around as it has a loop in the middle to hold it in place, resolving the design issue of many of their other shoes.",

I have a pretty high volume foot and am technically on the wider end of the spectrum. These feel too wide. Worse however is the fact that they are at least a full size to size and a half larger tan stated. My foot wants to slip out every time I step.

        "reviewBody": "I absolutely love the Cotopaxi Allpa Mini 20L Travel Pack! It’s been a game-changer for me, especially when it comes to air travel. As someone who used to dread packing, this bag has made the process so much easier and more enjoyable. Its compact size fits perfectly as a personal item on flights, sliding effortlessly under the seat without feeling cramped.\n\nThe layout is incredibly thoughtful, with just the right number of compartments to keep everything organized without overcomplicating things. The water bottle holder deserves a special mention—it’s snug and securely held my Hydro Flask in place, which is something I’ve struggled to find in other bags.\n\nIf you’re looking for a travel pack that simplifies packing, keeps you organized, and fits seamlessly into your travel routine, the Cotopaxi Allpa Mini 20L is it. Highly recommend!",

The original drones would stretch and conform to your foot and these just don&apos;t.  All the little gaps and hot spots that existed the first time I tried them on still exist 15+ seasons in.  Another reviewer described them as feeling like a wooden shoe and I think that is perfect.  The stiff one piece forefoot feels like a barrier between your foot and the rock.  I entry is also smaller than the original making getting them on and off more challenging.  What a bummer.",

My toes reached the end of the shoe but weren’t smooshed. I hopped right on my projects in the gym and sent a couple, which is usually unheard of in brand new shoes. I took the Drone 2.0s outside and climbed a few hard routes without missing a beat. I love the design of these shoes and they edge perfectly.

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been a loyal fan of Mountain Hardware Dynama capris for years, and they have always been my go-to for just about everything. However, I&apos;m quite disappointed with the new design. While I appreciate that they are still wearable, I noticed that this latest pair runs a bit larger than my previous ones, making them look quite baggy on me. \n\nOne of the most baffling changes is the removal of the functional pocket on the left thigh, which was perfect for holding a phone. Instead, they&apos;ve added a non-functional pocket on the right side that can barely fit a driver&apos;s license. This change results in three pockets on one side, which, when used, makes the pants uneven and causes them to pull down on that side.\n\nWhoever thought this redesign was a good idea clearly didn&apos;t consider functionality. I didn&apos;t realize the design had changed and washed them before inspecting and trying them on so I am stuck with my new pair and hoping for the best, but I sincerely hope Mountain Hardware reconsiders these changes in future versions.",

I stuffed a months-worth of clothes, shoes and bedding in this bag and it held up through multiple airports as a checked bag. The zippers are very strong and durable and the internal mesh pouch with zippers helped with organization. The three external handles make it easy to maneuver and pack and the backpack straps are comfortable even with over 40 lbs of weight in the bag. Would definitely recommend!",

It wears comfortably and the back is padded and breathable. It fits my frame well as a 5’3” female. I am pretty picky with the weight of empty packs and this is truly lightweight. It feels like nothing when worn. I love that the inside of the main compartment has a label with some first aid information. It is basic information, but very nice to have if the situation ever arises. There is a small top compartment that can hold keys, valuables, and other small items that you need easy access to. The outer pocket is spacious and feels secure. The pocket is formed by the dark and light colorblocked panels where the logo is. The two panels are connected and you just slip your items inside.  It is easy to put stuff in it, but I do wish to be able to open it up fully with a buckle or through other means. If I could change one thing, it would be to have taller water bottle side pockets. I have a 24oz bottle that is around 10 inches tall. While it technically fits, it does not feel secure enough. The pockets are better suited for shorter water bottles.",

As always, I’m impressed with the quality of these products. I am 5’2” and 112 pounds. The bottom is a little wide, and the sleeves a little long, but the snap closure on the sleeves and the elastic around the bottom bring those things in fine. I see complaints on the width of the sleeves, I have larger biceps, and this isn’t an issue for me.",

I ordered the S and M but the M fits better around my back and shoulders. However, the bottom of the jacket flares out and would look better on someone with curves! You can pull the jacket in at the hem using toggles though, which works well. I also like the long sleeves. The hood could be better if it was adjustable, but it’s a decent size. Overall, really nice and I’m looking forward to wearing it.",

        "reviewBody": "Hard to give it a review that&apos;ll work for everyone, but I&apos;ll try to make it generic so it helps more people.\n\nSizing is spot on.  I have a 59.5cm head, ordered a large, I have room to go both ways with the adjustments, so that&apos;s good for winter riding when I have a skull cap under there, and in the warmer weather after I freshly buzz my head.  \n\nAdjustments are easy, no dial on the back like I&apos;m used to, it&apos;s more like a large strap on the back/top of the helmet.  You rotate it either way and it snugs down.  There is also a positioning mechanism inside that will move the rear head brace up or down depending on how you want the helmet to sit on your head.  \n\nThe straps and the adjusting sliders are great, they didn&apos;t move yet after I set them (ridden the helmet of course to confirm).  That&apos;s actually nice, I hate when stuff moves and I end up fiddling around every couple rides to get it all back.  \n\nThe helmet doesn&apos;t seem loud or quiet, it&apos;s just right in the middle.  I always hope for a quiet helmet, something that baffles the air in just such a way that you don&apos;t endlessly sound like you&apos;re in a hurricane.  This one is neither, so it&apos;s fine there.\n\nThe sweat pads aren&apos;t the best.  It was 65 and sunny the last time I rode it, and the sweat was running down my face and into my eyes.  I&apos;m slightly worried about the hot 90+ degree days I have waiting for me, but horses for courses, I&apos;ll just use my other helmet as a backup if it&apos;s a problem.  I can&apos;t ding it a star here, look at it, it doesn&apos;t have a million vents like the other style helmets, so of course it won&apos;t flow as much air.  I knew this going into it, so just noting.  \n\nFit overall on my oval shaped head is dead on, I&apos;m fine in whatever, but it does seem to not move at all nor do I get pressure points from having it snuggly sitting on my head (like it should).\n\nNot sure about the effectiveness of the crumple zone helmet, I&apos;d have to see it done on a crash test dummy to really believe it, but it does make more sense than the MIPS system to me.  \n\nWeight is fine too, I didn&apos;t weigh it but my neck feels just fine after riding.  If I get to the point that I can&apos;t ride my bike because my helmet is too heavy I got bigger issues.\n\nOne thing - there&apos;s no good spot to really put your sunglasses if you want to flip them up and wipe your eyes or get some air.  They sit in the intended slots not super great, that&apos;s something you get more choice with when you get a non-aero helmet.  Not a big deal, throw them in your jersey or hook on the front.\n\nAesthetically, I like it too.  I got black, nice and simple.  \n\nThat&apos;s about it.  Good helmet, does what I ask of it, and if I ever need to REALLY use it, there&apos;s a crash replacement program you can choose to use from Lazer, which is nice when you pony up almost 300 bucks for something these days.",

It is ideally crafted and was admired by the captain on a spectator vessel at Americas Cup finals in Barcelona in September. He said he had tried to find one of similar design with stiff brim, SPF protection and was comfortable.  There was nothing he could find like it in Europe.  Being the generous sea-faring man that I am, I gave it to him at the end of the trip.  The captain was extremely grateful and other passengers that day were impressed. As soon as I got back, I popped for a replacement from the website.",

I did have to go one size up. I have a very round head and when I tried on a Large size helmet, I was getting hot spots on my head. Going one size up resolved that and the XL helmet doesn&apos;t feel big at all. The BOA really helps with fine tuning and making the helmet feel snug on your head. It also fits well with my Anon M4 goggles. Its a very clean look.",

This is my first tubeless setup and my first set of carbon rims.  WOW, what a set up!  I have never mounted tubeless tires.  I followed the video on the ENVE website and had ZERO issues.  I did have to go to my bike shop so I could get enough pressure to &quot;snap&quot; the tires in place.  My floor pump was not enough.  That was on me, not the tires.  I ride on paved roads 100% of the time.  I do live in the Midwest.  Numerous potholes, un even pavement, and many small branches have been ridden over.  I hope I do not jinx myself, no flats!

        "reviewBody": "These tires are awesome! Running them at 55psi and it&apos;s like riding on a cloud.\n\nSome people should learn how to setup tubeless before complaining about them. It&apos;s a process to be learned and these tires aren&apos;t any different to others I&apos;ve tried (Cadex/Schwalbe).\n\nAlmost 500 miles in and they&apos;ve held up perfectly. Was tight getting on but that&apos;s all tubeless tires (soapy water people). Anyway, would you rather they be loose and blow off? Enve&apos;s sealed up well after 24hrs with sealant inside. Does need to be topped off with air every 48hrs or so since they&apos;re at a lower pressure (55psi for me) and they&apos;re tubeless.\n\nAlso ignore the flat blamers on the tires. If you don&apos;t drive race tires through glass/holes they&apos;ll last and you won&apos;t get flats.\n\nComing from Cadex tires to these was a game changer. If you&apos;re on hookless wheels getcha some!",

          "Thanks for the review.  Got a set of these coming 700x31 to mount up on Zipp 303 Firecrest Disc hookless rims.  We&apos;ll see how they mount up but as you say, with the right process, shouldn&apos;t be an issue.  Am interested to see how they perform.  Used to GP5000&apos;s and Schwalbe One&apos;s.\n\nCouldn&apos;t agree more on the road hazards issue, if you want supple and fast then don&apos;t run over a lot of glass, metal and other sharp road detritus, and try not to hammer through square edged potholes.  Personally I&apos;d rather have the grip, feel, and speed of a good race tire, I always carry a tube or two in case of a flat that won&apos;t seal."

With all the fear, uncertainty and doubt around tubeless, I feel this is the best option to ride with a high quality product that gives me peace of mind. They roll well and I have no complaints. Sure, they were hard to put in, just like all the other tubeless I&apos;ve used before. With a bit of powder and patience it&apos;s relatively straightforward.",

It&apos;s second function is to move moisture from your body to the outer layer.  Failed there as well.  I am drenched within the first thirty minutes.  I had high hopes for this but adding extra base layers doesn&apos;t really seem to be helping.  I gave it two stars because I love the fit and the workmanship is top notch.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought the 210 Short divider for my Tundra.  Well it&apos;s good, just not great.  Maybe my expectations were higher than the products capabilities.  So I loaded up the 210 Tundra for a family vacation, I wanted to use the short divider to make two compartments.  One side was going to be ice, the other side for food/condiments.  I loaded up approximately  100lbs of ice (5-20lb loads of bulk ice), drove home to start loading my truck for the trip.  When I got to loading the food I noticed the divider was bowing due to the weight of the ice I loaded previously.  While the divider was inserted correctly into the Tundra slots I never expected the ice weight to bow the divider.    I do think the divider could be engineered with a bit more gussets to prevent the bowing.  Maybe even using a bit stouter material that can hold the load of the ice.  Yea...I could have used the ice blocks or other &quot;reusable&quot; style ice blocks but I wanted to see what the capacity of the 210 Tundra was for ice.  I will continue to use the divider, the 210 held &quot;ice&quot; for at least 5-6 days afterwards.   Just $.02 from a Yeti user.",

Once receiving my pair there was noticeable discomfort on my lateral ball point on my right foot (the knuckle behind my pinkie toe). This is slightly common with shoes for me, it takes a small break in period usually. I have run maybe 30 miles in these since April due to pain avoidance and have just kept primarily running in my Hoka Arahi&apos;s. Having a race come up i decided to finally just commit to breaking these in and ran 4 back to back 5k&apos;s this week, modifying my gate so it didn&apos;t aggravate my LBP, and today, immediately after my run i have searing pain in my right foot at the oblique head area and am afraid i will have to miss my anticipated charity run.

        "reviewBody": "I picked up a USWE Outlander 3 at a LBS after trying it on.  I wasn&apos;t sure how the No Dancing Monkey straps would work out for a smaller guy, but found them quite simple to adjust, and both comfortable and stable.  Not sure how this would apply for a female with a more ample chest, as it wasn&apos;t a great fit for my wife.  Bottom line, the unique straps system works well for me, although it&apos;s not anthing revolutionary, and may not be ideal for everyone.  \n\nThe 3L version is just too small for many of my rides, and while great for short mild temp rides, it just didn&apos;t have the room for enough water or any extra layers beyond a very compact wind shell along with my tools.\n\nThis 9L version has adequate capacity for most of my rides, with a 3L bladder, and room for tools and a first aid kit, along with a modest number of layers.  There is also a small phone pocket that could also fit some snacks.\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind with USWE is that the volume capacity includes the bladder, so size up compared to an Osprey or CamelBak.  This 9L pack holds about the same amount of water and stuff that my Osprey Viper 3 held.\n\nFinally kudos to USWE for including some bright colors in their selection.  I am almost exclusively a mountain biker, but often have to hop on a road during a ride.  The orange is also a nice choice when riding during hunting season.  Not getting shot or run over takes precednce over wearing a more fashionable muted shade, although they offer basic black for those who prefer to ride stealth.",

Add this USWE pack and I added 2 L more fluid to my rides. I could put 3L in the pack, but 2 lets me have plenty of storage for a first aid kit, Gilet, Jacket, tools, my inreach and more then enough nutrition for my 100 mile gravel adventures. the added bonus is the hydro pack spout for quick sips without reaching for a bottle.",

It has a phone pocket, tool loops inside, and still space for snacks while you’re out. The best part about this bag is that it truly doesn’t move! It stays secure to your chest while hitting jumps and doesn’t bounce around on trails in anyway. Highly recommend this to any rider.",

The II fits SO much better.\r\nMy feet actually hurt after wearing these, and though they look great they are too wide around the opening and do not provide decent support.  The fit overall for sizing is true. Would not purchase again even though I am dedicated Bushido customer.  Too bad.",

I&apos;ve sometimes added a thin base layer or ski socks to add a little more insulation as weather has dictated.  They are not wind-proof!  All that being said, in the months I&apos;ve had them I&apos;ve gotten tons of use out of them, both on road and on trails. The shoulder straps and chamois are comfy.  \nDon&apos;t buy these thinking they&apos;ll be all you need in freezing temps.

They are very versatile, and allow you to add or subtract layers based on the current weather without having to bring three separate jackets because who has space and time for that! It already has effectively kept me warm during freezing temperatures, and dry from sudden sprinkles of rain. I love the color - subtle enough for that everyday cute look, but bright enough to stand out if someone is looking for you. The only thing is that I wish that the inner layer was thicker and more plush - something difficult to convey online. This jacket should last me a while, but I would definitely buy again.",

I&apos;ll use it for my everyday wear.\n\nThe snaps are convenient and the velcro pocket with a pen &quot;hole&quot; are features that put this shirt at the front of my closet.",

The new shirt is fine in the waist but way too tight in the shoulders and arms. I&apos;ve returned the XL for a XXL so we&apos;ll see how that fits. Hopefully good in the arms and shoulder but not too big in the waist?",

Ski mainly in VT/NH and up until last year they were still fairly warm, but I just bought a pair of 3-Finger ones.  I&apos;ve used these everywhere from Utah, Rogers Pass, Revelstoke, you name it.  They&apos;re fairly water proof (I did wax them up every year) but they definitely are NOT like Gore-Tex, but I think that&apos;s OK.  If anything, I sweat in them more than they get wet from the outside.  They have great dexterity and I couldn&apos;t be happier with them.  The only cut I got in them was from a beer-league race ski and that was about 5 years ago.  It hasn&apos;t grown at all, and I should probably patch it up at some point.\nI got a size 10 and they fit me perfect, so I&apos;m not sure if the fit is tight or not to be honest.  I&apos;m getting a 10 and 11 in the new ones to try out.\n\nI&apos;ve also found that the Goat Leather in these takes the waxing better than the cow leather in my other Hestra gloves.  Maybe I did something wrong, but these went back to the normal suppleness of the leather while being more water proof.  My other cow leather ones got kind of stiff.",

No way in heck my hands even come close to fitting inside them.  What in the world is going on Backcountry ?

I have been on the snow about 75-100 days/year for the past 20 years, and the vertical cut has always been my go-to hand cover of choice. I easily get 250-300 days out of a pair with no rips, holes or issues of any kind. Put them on in the AM and leave them on all day. No need to take them off to grab things with surgical precision while on the hill. Sure, during 15&quot;+ storm days, I do like the extra cuff that comes with the Army Leather glove. But, the AL gloves are no where near as supple. If you need freedom of movement and warmth, look no further.",

The silicone cleans so easily and there&apos;s no fear of dropping these bowls. I have a different color and am planning to get more. I love them for dog food because they are deep, hold a lot, and they wipe off super easily which is great when you have limited water or are on the go! The bowl pic contains 1c dry food. I mix in some yummy wet food and appreciate the tall sides to keep from spilling while mixing. I don&apos;t love them for water, although they do work for water, just because they are so floppy it takes a bit extra care.",

They are quality, and you immediately feel the high quality when you put them on. They still look relatively new, and feel just as great.\n\nI recently bought a pair of c5 optiline (red band/accents at bottom of shorts). It&apos;s as if a different company made these shorts. You immediately feel the low quality when you put them on. The fabric is too stretchy, and the red band/accent on legs immediately lost their shape and look like an old cotton shirt that has completely lost its shape after less than 2-3 months of wearing them. The chamois is thin, and not comfortable at all. Because the whole bib short is too stretchy, it doesn&apos;t stay in place when you&apos;re riding, and it feels like you&apos;re swimming inside the shorts. \n\nDon&apos;t buy the optiline.",

It sits where it needs to be and doesn&apos;t move when you walk. The bib starts just above the knee and isn&apos;t overly tight yet doesn&apos;t have any movement when riding. The shoulder straps are wide, soft and don&apos;t have an uncomfortable pull.\n\nThere is no &quot;cup&quot; cut out that may seem that exists in the photos. Thats just the way stitching comes together and is an optical illusion in the photo. They did place a piece of fabric between the outer bib and the chamois over the groin area to block the wind and it work really well. However, don&apos;t expect a special cup cut out for your junk. Unfortunately everything gets compressed like in all the other bibs.\n\nOverall, the material sits tight and doesn&apos;t move. I&apos;m average build and unlike Castelli bibs, where I need to order 2 sizes up, this one truly fits for an average US male. I was comfortable in this chamois on multiple 30 mile rides and had no issues.",

One glove did get a nick in the goat palm patch after a year of heavy use, but the shell is still intact. I am ordering my second pair dedicated to snowboarding. I have 7&quot; from wrist to mid finger tip, so ordered XS. True to size",

        "reviewBody": "I have had this bag for several seasons and I can say that it is extremely durable, extremely comfortable, and extremely versatile. In summary: if you buy this, you will not regret it. It is as good or better than any other bag I have had the chance to play with. The best features are the harness, which is comfortable up to 30lbs; the expansion collar, which I have used to either create more internal space or to create a shelf in the zipped area above the main compartment - genius design; and the back panel entry, which is useful for more than just skiing/climbing - I used this pack as my onebag for a two-week trip to Portugal. Genuinely, I love this backpack.\r\n\r\nI have 3 main complaints but they are small and arranged in decreasing importance.\r\n\r\n1. The roll-top collar is not shaped properly. They needed to flare the collar at an angle to give adequate dimensions for it to function as intended. It still works, but you definitely find that you are constrained once you roll the top enough to make sure it is properly sealed.\r\n\r\n2. The diagonal carry is not....great. It works, but it is not much faster than A-frame and it is less comfortable. In a perfect world, you should be able to transition to/from diagonal carry without removing your pack, but here you must. That having been said, in all but most skimo racing packs, you have to remove your pack to do diagonal carry anyway, so this is a wash. Personally, I would like a dedicated accessory for diagonal carry that makes it easier to deploy without removing your pack - I would pay more money for the add-on. I have opted to use oversize Voile straps instead of the included accessory straps since Voile straps are less fiddly in cold temps with numb fingers or with gloves on.\r\n\r\n3. I would like symmetrical, internal, side-mounted pockets for a water bottle and radio. Not essential, but when your pack is mostly empty, everything is either slumped in the bottom or zipped up in the top compartment. It all works, but it is a nice feature that would make this a bit more polished. \r\n\r\nBuy this pack. You will not regret it. In bounds, out of bounds, travel, everyday, it works.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this bag a few weeks ago to use as a skiing/snowshoeing pack in the winter, and as an all-season pack for photography gear (the back panel opening works well for this purpose). I went with the 34L Pro size because the expandable rolltop seemed like a good option to have, especially with a camera cube taking up a lot of the space in the main compartment. The Pro size also has an extra pocket on the front for skins or other stuffable items, that the next size down doesn&apos;t have.\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n\r\nVery durable construction, great straps and attachment points. The black color looks kind of gray in the product photos, but it&apos;s actually a very normal backpacky black.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nThe external features of the pack are excellent. I really like how many strap points there are. Even though there aren&apos;t water bottle holders on the side, you can use the two loops on the lower part of the side panel to mount an external water bottle carrier. You can also strap all sorts of stuff to the outside using the other mount points, such as skis, snowshoes, helmet, ice axe, tripod, etc.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else was thinking of using this for camera gear: The main compartment fits an F-Stop Medium Shallow camera cube but it&apos;s a bit of a squeeze (maybe 0.5&quot; too large in depth and width). Dakine makes a slightly smaller cube for their ski packs that would fit really well, and of course there are tons of others on the market.\r\n\r\nThe avy gear and skins pockets are fairly slim so you can pretty much only use them for their intended purposes, especially if the main pocket is stuffed. The rolltop is useful when you need more space for a jacket or something. It&apos;s also cool how it packs away and makes the pack look pretty &quot;normal&quot; rather than like a hiking pack with the 4-strap cap top.\r\n\r\nOne thing I&apos;d change is to provide more structure/support to the plastic loop that acts as the frame and the bottom of the pack, so that it stands up on its own more easily and keeps its shape when the back panel is zipped open for packing/removing items.\r\n\r\nSizing:\r\n\r\nThe 34L runs a little big - specifically it&apos;s a long top to bottom. I&apos;m 5&apos;9&quot; and wear a 30&quot; to 32&quot; pant size and felt like I was really tightening down the straps to keep the pack stable and transfer the weight to my hips. Since I also want to use the bag in the summer, and the back padding isn&apos;t super breathable compared to dedicated 3-season packs, I ordered the 32L SL to see if it had a more natural fit. The Deuter site recommends the SL size (32L in this case) for men who wear a small or medium size, although they also call it a women&apos;s size and attaches a tag saying so to the pack. I attached some photos - the 34L is black and the 32L is blue. Differences:\r\n\r\n- The 34L waist strap fins are 10.75&quot; long, 32L fins are 9.75&quot;. The fins might be at a slight inward angle on the 32 compared to the vertical attachment on the 34. The hip strap felt a bit more comfortable for me in the 32.\r\n\r\n- The 32L straps are thinner by about 0.25 to 0.5&quot;, shorter by about 2&quot;, and the top of the straps are attached to the pack 0.5&quot; lower down. I didn&apos;t like the thin shape as much but I understand that&apos;s the key women-specific detail in the SL fit.\r\n\r\n- Other dimensions seem almost the same, the 34L might be a tiny bit wider. Not sure where the 2L difference comes from.\r\n\r\nUltimately I&apos;m keeping the 34L because I like the black color better and it&apos;s close enough in fit, but if you are any smaller than me I&apos;d definitely consider the SL size.",

I purchased these on sale despite ridiculous price and unfortunately the right glove is tearing at seams after 2-3 rides, less than 100miles riding on tarmac. No falls, mechanicals, etc, literally only touched the bars and my water bottle. \n\nCertainly look cool, thin material breathes well but obviously too fragile for anything beyond being replaced after every stage of the Tour if you happen to be sponsored.",

I like a lot of the features including all of the adjustable options which allows for a better fit and really like the blue granite colour. I also like the water bottle compartment on the sides. It feels secure when I put a water bottle in it. I tested it out on a rainy day and it held up pretty well. There was some water on it but it repelled off and dried up super fast. Some of the features I think that could use improvements include the cardboard in the front that once it gets bent I felt like I was breaking it. It could also use more pockets. It only has the main storage area and a smaller pocket inside it as well as a smaller pocket outside that can be hard to access at times. The hip strap is a bit weak too and I was hoping for more support. Overall seems good so far, but could definitely use some improvements.",

        "reviewBody": "I want to support Osprey&apos;s venturing into bikepacking but this bag falls short. First off, the center divider makes it so only skinny long items like a pump or jerky sticks will fit. This in combination with material that has zero stretch makes this bag unforgiving and not adaptable for bikepacking. Only used this bag for 1 trip because I need to maximize every inch and this bag weighed more and carried less. In comparison, I bought an Oveja Negra top tube bag that had some stretch along with compartments that allow for a wider range of shapes to fit.",

I got a desert brown one and it looks great on me. This one runs a large than usual size. But if you are going to layer some clothes underneath then it is true to size! I&apos;m 58kg/161cm and I could fit into size XXS, XS, and S. I have narrow shoulders, but size XXS makes me feel a bit tight on my shoulder when I move around my arms. XS is a good fit to me but not enough for extra layers. Eventually I got a size S. (I normally wear S-M).",

It is a bit on the roomy/baggy side, which I like since I could layer up with a thick sweater in colder months. I love the big front pocket feature for carrying keys, phone, and lip balms without worrying about it falling out.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t show in the detailed photos but there&apos;s a little mesh pocket within the side pocket to tuck in your keys safely(I love this feature!). I got it in deep forest color (which is no longer available I think), and I get compliments all the time when I&apos;m wearing it. I will cherish this jacket for many seasons to come.",

No sagging even with a pretty full load. \n\nHold two water bottles very tightly so no bobbing or popping out. \n\nHad a lightweight insulated jacket on one day and had to remove it and was able to strap it to the outside of the pack where it stayed put. \n\nPleasantly surprised at how well the waist pack works and how comfortable it is to wear.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a fairly experienced mountain biker, obsessed with the sport.  I&apos;ve been through many pedals to find the ones that fit me best.  Honestly, a lot are great.  Additionally, many are very similar.\n\nThe Supacaz Smash pedals are very good.  At the time of writing, with the sale price, definitely 5 stars.  At the retail price.. no way!  Composite pedals should really top out at $40 or so.  Hence the 4 star rating I assigned.\n\nThe pedals ARE concave.  Don&apos;t let the axle bearing/bushing bulges fool you.  The outer pins sit at a higher vertical vs the central pins.  This concave pin arrangement is great for grip.\n\nIn all I can&apos;t find any functional faults wit this pedal.  The platform is a good size, the profile is a decently thin.  I would take this over the Raceface Chester&apos;s any day (worse grip).  These Supacaz pedals are also sold as the TAG Metals T3.  Another similar pedal is the Bontrager/Trek Line Elite which I also recommend.  Overall, a nice pedal, all one really needs.  The composite material used for this pedal has a nice rigid/hefty feel so does feel more solid (eg. closer to aluminum pedals) than the Bontrager underfoot.",

I like my climbing shoes even tighter than that. Still, I ordered my usual RUNNING SHOE size; those of you who run know that means .5 UP. Erred on the very large side given the online order. They were so small I could barely put them on, and once they were on, I was basically making a fist with my toes and couldn’t lace them or stand up. Didn’t even know my foot could bend like that. Really bummer because this is a beautiful, well-made, versatile shoe, but it unfortunately has to go straight back in the mail. Please do not discontinue — just fix sizing!",
