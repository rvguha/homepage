        "reviewBody": "I just took this pack to Zion Nat&apos;l Park and couldn&apos;t have asked for a better bag! Spent 3 days wearing it all day on long hikes without the hip belt, packed with 3L of water, a bunch of snacks, and essentials and never had sore shoulders. I liked how it carried my hiking poles securely during a little scrambling, and thought the back and straps had enough circulation to stay cool even when soaked with sweat. The chest strap was comfortable due to its elastic ease, and the layout of the pockets were ample enough to stay organized, but simple enough to be quick and easy to use. I like how this pack is smaller at the bottom, so the things you hope to not use stay out of the way, and the things you plan on interacting with more don&apos;t get lost at the bottom, but stay at the fuller top for quick access with good visibility. Ample space for day hikes. Only improvement I could ask for is softer fabric on the edge of the straps. They rubbed the front of my shoulders a little bit when in a tank top, but honestly it wasn&apos;t a big enough deal to knock a star off my rating. Thrilled with my purchase and look forward to trying the hip belt once I have more weight in it!",

The included groud beef stroginoff recipe was great and my family loved it. I will have to make it again. I use mine for as few as 4-6 servings and as large as 20. Highly recommended.",

Only reason for  needing a second pair is the sole began to split where it connects to the shoe - the warranty replacement process was super easy.

        "reviewBody": "Jury is still out on these jeans. I ordered them in the 26 (which is my usual size) and agree with  the other reviewer - I could have gone down at least one size, possibly two. The denim is soft (and also thin if you live in a colder weather state and need warm pants). There are options to adjust the waist with a built in tabs on the waistband. But if you go with the tightest option, the pants do a weird fold-over thing and don&apos;t look like normal pants. So, if you can size down, I&apos;d do it. Or if you are good with the waist adjustments and a belt, you might be able to make them work. Also - count on them being a lot wider than they look on the model - these are very exaggerated and they just look kind of relaxed on the images.",

Haven&apos;t tested water proofing yet - will need spring snow conditions for that, but I did give them a double application of Bick LP and a quick flame job to drive it in and water beads and runs off, and it didn&apos;t discolor the leather. \n\nOnly drawbacks: there needs to be some rough out or double-stitched leather on the palm and thumb, and the wrist cuff is too tight if you wear a watch.\n\nWill see how durable they are.",

I&apos;ve worn them for the usual outdoors work, and general outdoors glove usage, in temps from about 25-40 degrees. They&apos;ve been totally warm, as long as activity levels are at least at a low-moderate level. Below freezing, they aren&apos;t what I&apos;d pick for stationary activities. Water resistance is solid, especially after waxing them, and they seem as tough or tougher than any other work glove I&apos;ve had. Fit is on the snug side, so if you&apos;re hesitating, I might size up. Although, the leather definitely breaks in to your hand. Highly recommended!",

        "reviewBody": "In the winter of 2022 I set out on an expedition in far Northern Quebec, starting in March and ending in April. I would travel with 14 others, and we would have one resupply. I had been preparing for almost a full year, which included a LOT of research on the best clothing to bring. But as with most trips, the final gear sort was very rushed. I mistook my girlfriend&apos;s flurry mitts for my own mittens, and packed them in my bag. By the time I realized my mistake I was sitting in a cozy Gaspe hostel, too far in to buy new mittens. So I dealt, and made it through with all my 10 fingers perfectly happy. I layered up with a pair of ski gloves and waterproof overmitts, but most of the insulation I got was from these mittens. Luckily temperatures were fairly balmy, rarely dropping below -20 degrees and my overmitts kept my hands well protected from the wind. I fell in the snow plenty, wore through my ski gloves, nearly lost a mitten behind my backpack, but I could always rely on these flurry mitts to keep my hands warm. I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve kept all my fingers without them. They were comfy, dried quickly, fit well enough (though I had no choice in the size), and were easily recognizable - being the lightest mittens in the tent. Even though I never intended to bring my girlfriend&apos;s flurry mitts on a subarctic expedition, I am so glad that I did.",

I&apos;ve had a couple issues in the past with other bottle cages with them breaking and just quickly wearing down after frequently taking bottles in and out, but these have had no issues, and they also have a nice clean look to match my bike perfectly, which is always a win! Would recommend for anyone looking for a bottle cage for their road bike or hardtail mountain bike. As for a full suspension mountain bike, something like a side-load cage may be a better fit.",

The sweater is quite long and keeps the lower back covered. The hood fits tight, which will come in handy on my upcoming expedition voyage to Canada&apos;s remote arctic.",

My husband and I attended an extremely muddy/wet festival - we were on our feet all day, all weekend. Though we didn&apos;t go hiking, we did do A LOT of walking through deep thick mud and giant puddles of water. It was mess, but you know what wasn&apos;t a mess - my feet and joints! I have mild/mod arthritis that affects most of my body, and I had little to no pain the next day. These shoes were so comfortable, kept my feet dry and supported, and were easy to clean up when we got home. Would highly recommend. Sad I waited months to finally use them.",

        "reviewBody": "Ive had this for a couple weeks now, so not a lot of use so far. Loaded with a 24hr kit (~20lbs) it carries great. Fit and finish are very good, all seams and stitching are tight and straight. The compression strap buckles are somewhat small, so will be interesting to see how those hold up. But the fact the straps are removable is great, you can easily change them out for something heavier in event of failure. Hip belt pockets are a little small, but well placed with easy to operate zippers.\r\nThe adjustable torso length is easy to use and works well. Hip belt fits well, with lots of length available to go from being in shorts to full winter kit.",

This line has everything I need, carries loads extremely comfortably for a long time, and isn&apos;t overburdened with overdesigned pockets, zips, compartments, etc.  A really versatile, well-designed backpacker&apos;s dream.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this pack about 6 months ago for a through hike around Mt. Blanc in France.  I trained carrying a 45 lbs load six miles roundtrip up and down a peak by my house with 2500&apos; vertical gain.  After probably 50 up and downs for training and then the through hike of 100 miles around the Trail Du Mont Blanc, I must say this pack does not disappoint.  I honestly have nothing negative.  Every time I thought a feature was silly or didn&apos;t work I found an opportunity to use it later on. \r\n-The top is large and spacious with a huge pocket.  The extra waterproof durable zipper holds everything in and keeps it dry.  \r\n-Large internal pocket with a nice side zipper when you need it. I also like the cinch strap and the over latch that fits really well. \r\n-Exterior is perfect. From hanging wet socks in the pole holders to cramming rain gear and water bottles on the outside.  I also stuck in micro trax in the pockets for quick use on snow travel. \r\n-Straps are super comfortable (make sure you follower their sizing and fitting videos!).  Back piece is comfortable and breathes perfect.  \r\nMy last thought is I highly recommend the zoid bags.  I bought the small black on for extra quick stuff at the top (headlamp, inreach, etc...) and then my toiletries went in the big orange on the sipper side of the bag.  Get the clear ones...they are time savers!\r\nThis is an amazing bag.  I looked a lot of other bags....a lot of other bags.  I ultimately pulled the trigger with Mystery Ranch because they stood by their product.  However, I got quite the chuckle when I rolled into Chamonix on day 8 of being on the trail hiking anywhere from 12-22 miles a day in snow and rain, and my bag still looked brand new! So the ultimate downfall is you don&apos;t get any street cred for a tattered roughed up bag because it is bomber.  Highly recommend, five stars, you won&apos;t regret!",

I think the independent RADIX belt must play a role? Maybe, in any case the comfort is fantastic. \r\n\r\nSorry for the broken English, I use google translate",

It packed all my gear (and extra team gear) easily and made it feel like a quarter of the weight it really was.

The three large exterior pockets were spacey, and the center exterior pocket fit the avalanche rescue kit (shovel, probe, and ice axe) perfectly.

        "reviewBody": "Hiked on these for 3 weeks in the Dolomites. Comfortable. Good grip even on wet limestone. Great shoe to accommodate wide toe box. Maybe a bit too large, wore thicker socks. Works great for general hiking and as easy approach shoe. But the sole is too soft for via ferrata or scrambling. My foot placements held, but they were sloppy, leaning, not 100% solid. Handled scree, steep slopes, rock, grass all okay just not solid enough for more technical. Goretex kept socks dry even in rain and snow.",

But not great for via ferrata, too flexible, not a solid enough edge. For moderate difficulty via ferrata okay, used arms, legs to compensate but harder via ferrata the lack of structural stability of shoe was an issue. Switched to other more rigid shoes. For hiking great but above that becomes problematic.",

They were on sale, so significantly cheaper than the Skylines. I wasn&apos;t sure about the brownish color, but for the price I decided to try them &amp; ordered them 1/2 size bigger than the Skylines. They are SO comfortable - wore them for the first time the other day on a 1.5 hour mountain hike &amp; no problems at all. And I think the color looks nicer in person than online. I also feel like these were a better value than the Skylines b/c they contain some genuine leather &amp; are Gortex. They feel more sturdy &amp; well-made, like a hiking shoe rather than a tennis shoe. I would definitely recommend.",

        "reviewBody": "I was looking for a bag that is exactly this, brief, backpack and duffle options around 20-25L. Basically something like a smaller version of the Thule Subterra 40L. I looked at several bags such as Timbuk2 Scheme, Briggs&amp;Riley ZDX, Everymans Hideout, and Thule boarding (which doesn&apos;t have a backpack). \n\nThe Aoede seems the closest to what I was looking for in looks, functionality and price range. It is minimalistic, sleek, simple to use and lightweight, and the materials are of course great. \nHowever, it lacks some features can could be easily implemented by a company like Osprey and improve the bags functionality.\n\nStructure: The bag does not have padding in the front compartment, meaning it has more give to pack but does not keep its structure. This is mostly annoying when using the upper handle as the bag collapses and loses it shape. This does not happen with the Thule Subterra for example that has a more rigid structure .\n\nLaptop: the compartment doesn&apos;t have anything that keep the laptop fixed, there is a pocket which is not padded. I feel that for a small bag it would make sense to have some sort of placement specifically for the laptop. The padding is ok but feels like the computer is just going to be moving around. There is no additional pockets for tech, even a small zipped pocket would make sense. This compartment opens as an L, which allows access in horizontal or vertical position, but why not just make it a U ? \n\nMain compartment: opens as a suitcase which is great but no pockets or mesh (which other bags do offer). If the bag is intended as a travel and everyday use, you might store some cloths or shoes. having a mesh (as in the thule and ZDX) would have made it so much more functional. Maybe a couple of mesh pockets?\n\nOrganization compartment: very basic, oriented as a backpack. it is a choice that the designers have to do, but the ZDX and Scheme have brief type of organization. This bag is called Briefpack, so you would expect it to be accessible as a brief...or some other solution that works for both modalities.\n\nNo padded pocket for phone or glasses: the quick access pocket is not really protective, nor very soft. Again, as a travel bag, you would expect to have a safe place to put you phone for example. Just a little bit of padding on the front panel would have solved that\n\nNo secret pocket: So there&apos;s no RFID pocket, which many travel bags do have now days (ZDX has two). The only &quot;safe&quot; pocket the bag has is inside the backack zipper, which is ok when the straps are tucked but not otherwise. Why not add a pocket under the luggage sleeve? (As the subterra has). As well as a place for an airtag (that could go in the main compartment), \n\nBackpack straps: The straps are comfortable, no sternum strap which is too bad... no elastics to keep the dangling tidy. \n\nShouder strap: it is comfortable, however, the padding is very small and when shortened there is no way to put it in the middle which is kind of weired.\n\nKey leash: not really functional as it doesn&apos;t extend or detach easliy, you might as well just put the keys in a pocket.\n\nOverall: I find the idea of the bag really great, I think that the minimalistic concept overpowered its functionality. As a consumer it just seems like a &quot;lazy&quot; implementation, the inside compartment feel a bit cheap (although it&apos;s probably made of good materials, it doesn&apos;t feel as such).\n\nIf this bag had an inner mesh, better structure, better organization with some extra pockets, sternum strap and better design for the laptop compartment it would have been a truly great bag. \nAt its current version I would describe it as OK and a bit disappointing in terms of functionality. \n\nI hope Osprey takes these comments to improve the bag.",

I got these in a 34. They fit a little big in the waist (which was to be expected), but they are exceptionally short in the inseam. The inseam on the pants i received measured at 30&quot;, not 32&quot;. It may be okay for some, but pants that stop 2 inches above my ankle just aren&apos;t my style. No huge deal though, got these for work and not to be stylish. I knew they&apos;d be covered in grease and dirt  within 24 hours of delivery. Should have paid more heed to other reviews regarding inconsistent sizing. If they came in a tall size, or had an inseam option, I would 100% buy them again as work pants.",

But in that 6 months, the brown is already fading. I&apos;ve had other pants that lasted 5 years with a similar amount of fading.\n\nAll things considered, these are 100% worth it if you can grab them on sale for $40, and I&apos;ll probably try to grab a second pair someday, but the $100 price is ludicrous.",

He is 6&apos;2 , 220lbs athletic build, and hates tight feeling pants!!). These in the size 34 are great for him and have a stretch to them. These are his new favorite pants. Very flattering! Could be work pants or even dressed up more for a casual or &quot;put together&quot; outfit. Love the brown color that isn&apos;t in stock anymore. I am just now purchasing the grey pair.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this tent to use as an easy, affordable part of my car camping setup, and it serves its purpose well\r\n\r\nThe tent is easy to set up and take down quickly. The materials and construction are sturdy. The rain fly goes on and off easily, keeps the tent rigid and stable in wind, and the tent stays dry, warm, and free of condensation under the fly. I slept through some rain without issue.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule is modest. Not a problem for me since I car camp and only stash my shoes in the vestibule while I sleep, but there wouldn&apos;t be much extra room in there to rummage through a multi day backpack, let alone two people&apos;s packs. It would work, but if you know you like extra space there isn&apos;t much to spare here. \r\n\r\nThe included stakes are pretty sturdy for base level stakes, I haven&apos;t bent any of them during setup (I use a hammer) and they held well in wind. I don&apos;t feel like I need to upgrade them for my purposes at this point. \r\n\r\nOne thing before buying for yourself, be aware of the dimensions of the tent and know how much space you need, this tent might not provide it for you. It is advertised as a two person tent, but there is only just enough room for me to be comfortable, I am 6&apos;1, 200lbs and I use a 3&quot; thick sleeping pad, and due to the angle of the tent walls my head or toes just slightly touch the walls when I fully stretch out. I used my friends grand mesa 2 before my purchase and knew what I was getting and it works for me, but if you are taller or use a taller sleeping setup or sleep with another person/dog/gear or like to do something other than lay down and sleep in your tent, you might consider a tent with a bigger footprint\r\n\r\nAll in all, the tent is very practical and functional for the price point. I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m missing out on anything for what I paid.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this tent on Cyber Monday 2021 to use for Kayak Camping this coming summer.   I have not used it, but I have set it up just to make sure there aren&apos;t any major defects. \n\nI understood when I purchased the tent that it wouldn&apos;t be a true bathtub floor, but it was fully seam sealed.  Since Kelty is supposed to be a better brand, I still expected the floor itself to be one piece even if there were seams between the floor &amp; the sides.  I was surprised to find a seam running from side to side across the tent closer to the foot end.  It&apos;s sealed, but still a disappointment.  If they&apos;re trying to sell more footprints, then it&apos;s working since I have already decided to purchase one before my first trip.\n\nAnother thing that was disappointing were the tent pole clips.  They were not the twist-style clips that were advertised on every website I used to research this tent.  Additionally, there are not 2 clips anchoring the peak as advertised.  Instead there is only one clip at the peak &amp; it is the same style as the rest of the pole clips.  While it&apos;s the same clip system as other Kelty tents such as the Late Start, this very much seems like an update made to cheapen up the production process.\n\nI am going to keep the tent &amp; hope for the best since I got a good deal on it &amp; I will not be an extremely heavy user.",

Eventually the rain fly kept sticking to itself and I couldn&apos;t remedy it. 22 years, not a bad run. Anyways... I&apos;ve taken the new one here on a few canoe camping trips and it&apos;s awesome! A little tight for 2 people but roomy for 1. I&apos;m amazed how tents have evolved and for the price, you can&apos;t beat it.\n\nIt&apos;s so easy and fast to set up/ take down. Lots of ventilation excellent for summer camping.\n\nProbably too heavy for backpacking but excellent for canoeing or car camping!",

Both need to be tighter and offer some compression and support.  Without that compression the weight of a phone makes them sag which is uncomfortable and the phone does not stay put. \r\n\r\n\r\nBottom line buy for the looks not the performance.

Concuring with others however, I find the inner tights way too loose and thigh pocket not able to hold anything securely. To minimise this I ordered a size probably a bit small for me, but that didn’t help. As an extra frustration the waist hem has barely any flexibility, and the draw chord not very effective so they are hard to get on, yet still loose in the inner! It’s as if nobody at Salomon actually tried these on when prototypes.",

The pocket looks secure but the inner liner can&apos;t take the weight of a phone when you&apos;re moving and indeed mine dropped out twice on a short run. Even when it was secure at the start of the run it moved about too much and rubbed my leg. They are comfortable shorts and I am sure will otherwise be ok, but as I bought them for the phone pocket, I wouldn&apos;t buy them again. I will return the second unworn pair I have.  I hope Salomon improve the design as a short with a phone pocket would be extremely useful. I had the same problem as the previous reviewer too - as my &apos;nickname&apos; was the same as someone else&apos;s the system deleted what I had written and I had to type the whole review again. Salomon you need to address this or some people simply won&apos;t leave reviews.",

Those open weaves coupled with its natural fabric do what&apos;s intended and make it my most comfortable route for hot times. They do however invite caution about catching on briars and the like, and it&apos;s not the t-shirt I&apos;d wear to paint the ceiling, way too precious for that. Give yourself a treat and get one!",

However, the outsole on both shoes is already chunking (big pieces falling off) and falling apart after just a couple of trips into the mountains.  Cheap adhesives and weak, not very grippy rubber.

On a long run last summer, I was feeling great in these on a rocky trail, then caught a pretty small rock just wrong and got a grade 2 AITFL sprain that kept me from running for 7 weeks.

        "reviewBody": "This shoe was close to being good. Good sole, traction, feels like a serious trail running shoe for rough terrain, however a couple issues:\n\n1. The achilles cup design - it comes to a point and somewhat points into into your heel instead of being a kind of u shape that cups your achilles, very odd. I spent time working this part of the shoes before wearing so that it would flex more and this helped however it wasn&apos;t very comfortable especially when the fore foot is extended forwards. \n2. Uppers - The deal breaker for me was that they were extremely unsecure when going downhill. No matter how tight i tied the laces my feet would still slide forward even though the fit of the shoe was right. The laces are thin like most La Sportivas however combine with an unusually thin tounge you will feel the laces cut into the top of your foot if you tie them tight enough to secure your feet. I just couldn&apos;t get them secure enough that i had to run painfully slow/cautiously downhill as my feel would frequently slide forward.\n\nLike many others i&apos;ve also resorted to buying overpriced Akasha&apos;s from Europe on ebay since that&apos;s the only place you can get them. La Sportiva just needs to start selling Akasha&apos;s in the US again, it&apos;s a perfect trail shoe!",

There is a place for everything &amp; as a Type A personality that goes a long way! \nI travel with the typical items, an extra set of clothing (if I check my bag), my medication (bc you should never put them in a checked bag), some extra toiletries (in case of flight delays), a comfy shoe change option (bc who wants to be forced to wear uncomfy shoes all day), my Pixel pad &amp; full size headphones (really drowns out the screams of hungry &amp; sleepy children), a couple of not so healthy snacks for when I get hangry, &amp; finally a book. \nI was able to fit all of that in this bag, still have room, &amp; it didn&apos;t feel like I was carrying around a load of bricks. \nEverything was easily accessible &amp; it was comfortable to carry. Really ticked all the boxes for me when it comes to a good backpack. Worth the price for sure.",

I tried on the bivy jacket and  loved it!,  but living in Southern California I really had no need to spend that much money for a jacket I would rarely be able to wear. This vest was just perfect for what I needed. I got the navy/army green vest on sale! It goes with most of my causal wardrobe and hiking gear. I love that I can throw this on over a long sleeved shirt , sweater or sweatshirt.  I really enjoy the hood and it does a great job blocking the wind which helps keep my warm without having to wear a beanie.  I intended on ordering a small but accidentally ordered an xs but it fits be perfectly, with enough room for light layering. \nYes it does attract dog hair, but that?s already a major part of my life LOL.",

        "reviewBody": "I eyed this vest for a long time before being ready to spend the money on it, but finally bought it in sage khaki. I have an obsession with vests because I dislike wearing bulky coats, and in Arkansas there&apos;s a good portion of the winter where a vest is sufficient if you aren&apos;t outside for extended periods of time. When I first tried it on, I wasn&apos;t sure if it would keep me as warm as my Patagonia Down Sweater Vest, and admittedly it&apos;s not the same fill level - but it&apos;s still significantly warmer than I expected! I also was hesitant about having a hood, but I really like it. I ordered the same size as my Patagonia Down Sweater Vest, and while it is maybe a little tighter across my chest, I wouldn&apos;t want to go up a size. I wore it on a slightly rainy day and was impressed with the fabric&apos;s resistance to water. My only complaint is that the canvas material tends to hold hair and fuzz, so I have to lint roller it before and after I wear it. If I am wearing a dark-colored long sleeve or flannel, I will notice that color of fuzz on the vest. Worth it, though, because the vest is unique and comfy!",

The fabric on the outside was tough enough to withstand some daily wear, but still soft.  The inside lining was silky and comfy.  Just what I would expect from Patagonia.  \nThe Small was a bit snug (I&apos;m 5&apos;4&quot; 130lbs with a small bust), so if I were to keep it, I&apos;d probably want a Medium.",

I&apos;m especially excited about the cozy pockets for my hands (there is a nice little zipper pocket inside too). I am also a fan of the hood on it. Vests have never really been my thing, so I hesitated for a long time with this purchase (seriously about 2 years). I am really happy with my purchase and expect to make good use of it.",

Literally no foot fatigue whatsoever which was a problem I had frequently with the Freeriders.

At first I loved this shirt, very comfortable, lots of excellent stretch, very good softshell water resistance as well - but durable, it is not.  It is described as durable, including abrasion resistant and suitable for climbing harness wear/tear, and materials feel like they will be.  But, first time out showed this to be far from true.   I did a fast hike/run with a backpack weighing about 35lbs.  Got back and put the shirt in for a gentle wash per label, and when it came out and dried, very bad piling was evident in each place where my rucksack was apparently rubbing including the back and shoulders where the shoulder straps covered.   This shirt would have been my favorite go to for excellent temperature and moisture regulation, excellent comfort and stretch, excellent looks, etc. But the lack of durability is very frustrating and disappointing.  My new shirt now looks horrible after only one use in the wilderness.",

        "reviewBody": "I switched to flat pedals on my mountain bike and bought these shoes at the same time as the pedals because I wasn&apos;t going to make the switch unless I found flat pedal shoes that fit my picky feet. Took my first ride yesterday and I was not disappointed. First off, the flat pedals were a gamechanger, and I&apos;m sure a lot of the reason for that was I loved these shoes as well. I wear an 8.5, which is what I ordered, and I would say they are slightly longer than my other 8.5 shoes but not noticeably so when I&apos;m riding. I have a pretty narrow foot and was able to adjust the laces to achieve the perfect fit. The toe box is pretty roomy (especially relative to my road shoes) which I preferred as the shoes are very breathable and I could wiggle my toes when my feet started feeling numb. I was worried the excess material on top would not be comfortable when I hiked up steep or rocky sections, but was very happy with how well they performed when I did that a few times during the ride, plus they felt more like good hiking shoes compared to more snuggly fitting shoes with cleats on the bottom.",

I bought a second pair immediately. I love the weight - not too hot. I love the fact that they don&apos;t ride up when biking. I always have my iPhone in the side pocket and it is easy to zip and unzip for photo time. The fit is great and like the extra elastic to get them to stretch enough over my belly! My bike liners fit easily underneath. They work great for hiking as well. I love them! Love the light colors too - I got gray and that dusty pink. I am wearing the Astroman blouse in the photo fyi.

My goal was to find the smallest, most low-profile backpack for my 13” laptop and the Arcane small is the best I’ve found. In fact, I loved it so much I bought it in a 2nd color! The interior organizational pockets are perfect for holding smaller items, and it comfortably fits a water bottle and rain jacket with room to spare. \n\nMy only complaints are the stretchy pocket on the strap seems too small to be functional (what are y’all putting in there??) and I wish the front zipper were on the opposite side (just a personal preference).",

Only draw back is I don&apos;t feel it keeps things cool unless you add ice to that particular cooler.  Adding ice to my water bottles still didn&apos;t keep my drinks cold as I would have liked, so only draw back on cooler.  Other than that I use it everyday still for work",

        "reviewBody": "This tire (Rekon 3C/EXO+ 29 X 2.4) weighs about 8 oz more than the Rekon Race 29 X 2.4 standard 3C/EXO tire at 954 gm (33.6 oz) I bought a second Rekon that weighs 975 gm. I installed the lighter tire on the rear after my OEM Rekon Race wore out after 870 miles. I haven&apos;t installed the other tire on the front yet. The Race tire never gripped on the loose over hardpack very well. This tire has barely slipped in those conditions. I have ridden it 300 miles in the last month and I&apos;m very happy with the grip on the climbs and I have not had a flat or puncture. The tire&apos;s sidewall is also stiffer on this EXO+ edition. I was running 18 psi on the Rekon Race and went to 17 psi on this tire. (Too low? Gotta float like a butterfly across the rock gardens) I use this on a 120mm Orbea Oiz Full Susp XC bike. So far I have ridden the tire aggressively in the Park City area mountains, Draper and other foothill XC trails in Northern Utah. I don&apos;t ride skidders. I have ridden it across the Wasatch Crest a couple times too. It didn&apos;t rain for over 6 months so conditions have been dry and dusty. The tire was easy to install tubeless on Orbea&apos;s MP 30 carbon rims. I do not use inserts. The tire seems to be wearing really well, so far, comparing the tread to the new Rekon I haven&apos;t installed yet. I&apos;ll buy the tire again.",

The flaps on the pockets are annoying and it would have been good to have regular pockets as well and each side as opposed to front pockets only.

        "reviewBody": "I have a pack with this material weight already and its good for snow for light hiking, else I might have kept it.  Compression straps are thin and somehow a little wonky.  Shoulder straps are very flimsy and the bottom is not sturdy enough for what I intended to use this for.  I needed a pack for alpine rock and 3rd classing about.  I know that Deuter makes nice packs, I see them in the mountains all the time.  A friend has an older &quot;guide model&quot; about 5 years old and the thing is well built for mixed mountain travel.  This one is too light weight for my needs so I sent it back tags still attached after loading my kit and hefting it around with 18 Lbs. of my normal gear and a few layers in it.",

Even after tightening the webbing belt, it will eventually become loose and you would need to cinch it again.\n\n2.  The webbing belt can become twisted within the belt loops and you would need to untwist to keep it flat and allow proper orientation to lock the clasp.\n\n3.  The rubberized logo will come off after several washes.\n\nOverall I would not recommend these shorts.",

I was still waiting for the same product from another co and cancelled that order and bought a second from Backcountry. This is intended for use with a Joolca Nomad Hottap system (also awesome product).\n\nThe carrying case for the Ignik is very well made, with a molded interior and comes with the hose. The manual is simple but thorough. The strap is strong webbing with a reinforced hand grip. The zipper is smooth. I am still waiting on the Joolca, but this is perfect. I find the cost quite reasonable for a tank that is small enough to carry and can be refilled. It pays for itself in very short time.\n\nIn addition to camping, this will be used in conjunction with the Joolca Hottap during extended power outages, as my hot water heater is electric and my solar is grid-tied except for a separate solar charged backup power station system that cannot run the hot water heater.",

Plus they have different sizes from which to choose (tall and skinny to short and fat). Perhaps this has an extra ?carrying case jacket? but there?s no need, since the typical tanks have side carrying handles.   Why would you even want the case. I purchased my 5 lb tank for around $50 and it has quality brass hardware connections and hose length of my choice, made by a reputable propane company. \n\nI don?t understand what makes this three times more expensive than a typical 5 gal tank. Must be the marketing and the impractical but colorful carrying case.  Just pass on this and spend your money more wisely. Nothing novel to see here.",

It is so much fun on a Friday, or Saturday evening.  What is gross about it?  There are no restrooms along the river bank and you have no idea where someone has relived themself, once you see where they have, you get why you don&apos;t want to just sit anywhere and then not be sitting on something.  This blanket is easy to wash and dry.   Even being in the Alps, it is just a nice blanket to throw down to relax.  \n\nWould I recommend this blanket?  Yes.   I think it fits a niche that most blankets don&apos;t. It isn&apos;t the best picnic blanket or the best festival blanket, but when you look at how compact it is, it just gives you so much more freedom to travel and have something instead of nothing.",

I can bring a 32oz Nalgene and my 2L Platypus water filter in the large pocket, has a phone pocket and a couple other straps you can suspend some tools from.   I have also used this while traveling, it has a good amount of space / compartments you can hold all the daily essentials from you wallet, keys, glasses, weed whatever you need on hand this can hold it..\n\n6.7Ounces!!!! the only thing that would make this bag better would be if it was constructed with Dyneema Fabric..   I would say for the price this thing is 5 stars\n\n\nFeels",

        "reviewBody": "These shorts are incredible! They run true to size. I ordered size small and medium and the medium were loose and almost saggy. I wasn’t sure about the zipper pockets and how they would lay or if they would stick out but after washing it lays perfectly and go unnoticeable- honestly these are going to be my go to short this summer. I might buy some black ones to even sleep in they are that cozy! The other review complained about the liner but if the short didn’t have one then you could see through it on lighter color fabric- view the 2024 colorways. The liner fabric is wonderful almost like a bathing suit not that weird mesh that’s in some running shorts, and soft making this a great river short even though I purchased this for hiking and camping. I have the green color and the liner is brown if that matters to you.",

As a hiking short, I hate having the liner and makes it uncomfortable for backpacking trips. Too expensive of a short to cut it up however. The liner also makes the short fit weird, you can’t place it appropriately on your body how you’d like it to wear; the liner will ride up or sag. \n\nIf it weren’t for the liner, it seems to be a nice, cute fitting short. Love the zippered pocket &amp; lightweight material.",

I have purchased Patagonia before and could not resist the brand even though they are a bit higher priced. I am not disappointed with the purchase since the jacket offers plenty of warmth even with a thinner under layer. Great for the colder months and I am glad I don&apos;t have to bulk up. Now I can travel light during winter. Looking for additional colors to purchase. True to size for my lean frame.",

        "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s talk cozy! The Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket isn&apos;t just another fleece jacket; it&apos;s a cuddle in fabric form. Seriously, the inside feels like a luxurious cloud decided to become wearable. It&apos;s perfect for those crisp mornings by the campfire, or those days where you just need to cocoon yourself in warmth.\n\nBut this bad boy isn&apos;t all about feeling like a giant teddy bear. It&apos;s got some serious style chops too. The sweater-knit face makes it look polished enough to wear around town, so you can go from conquering a mountain to grabbing coffee with friends without having to do a wardrobe change. Plus, Patagonia&apos;s quality is legendary, and this jacket is built to last. I&apos;ve thrown it in the wash countless times and it still looks (and feels) amazing.\nNow, let&apos;s be honest, it&apos;s not gonna win any awards for handling a monsoon. But for light rain or snow, it holds its own. Think of it like a trusty sidekick – it&apos;ll keep you comfortable most of the time, but maybe pack an umbrella for the crazy weather days.\n\nAll in all, the Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket is a winner in my book. It&apos;s comfy, stylish, and built to last – what more could you ask for in a fleece companion?",

        "reviewBody": "It is not as warm as an average lightweight fleece jacket, but it is still nice. If you are in a breeze at 50°, you might be a bit chilly unless you have a light underlayment. The arms are slightly snug for what I’m used of but it is still OK and probably more fashionable than my older jackets. The material on the exterior will snag on the leather of my console which is slightly cracked. I thought my arm was stuck in syrup until I realized it was just acting like Velcro. The crack in the leather is very slight and you cannot feel any roughness with your fingers, but the jacket still snags to it , overall I am pleased with the purchase",

I couldn?t have fit these better if I got them in store. Now, let?s talk about feel? wow, these are so dagburn comfy I haven?t taken them off (except sleep) since I received them in the mail. I?m a shoe/boot guy so I have boxes of shoes and these are more comfy than any of my skate shoes. They might be a bit hot in dead summer but for what they are the breathing works absolutely great. These Heath almost like ultralight hiking boots. The grip is Vans on double dose steroids!  They are just as good if not better on the pedal hip as 5Tens, it?s just a different sole design so hard to compare the feel. Holy crap I don?t know how they do it but I have some Stamp Pedals and I can seriously pick my bike up a bit with the grab. At any rate, BUY these sons of motherless goats before they are gone!! PERFECT winter riding shoe in Austin TX. Hope this 2Sense helps all y?all.",

These are snug at the instep if you have “taller” feet; it took a few wears to start to feel comfortable, and takes a shoe horn every time to get them on. Surprisingly roomy at toe box (which is where my width is). Learher and construction seem good. Cork later at the sole makes these a bit more casual, but colorwise, plays well with all the neutrals.  Good looking for a casual boot. Squeaky for first day, then not again. Haven’t tested waterproofing yet.",

I literally wore these shoes for the very first time this week for 6 days (Monday-Saturday) 8 hours a day and they look like Ive had them for years. They are comfortable, but the crease where my toe bends cracked, and the leather really stretched. I am 5&apos; 11&quot; and 180 pounds. I am not some huge dude. These shoes shouldn&apos;t have worn this quickly for the price. I was literally only walking around on gravel. The sole is barely worn.",

        "reviewBody": "My wife and I purchased the GateMate PRO a few months ago at the same time we purchased new bikes. We have had great experience with other Thule products in the past and this seemed like a great way for us to transport our new bikes. However I find it challenging to install the GateMate. The straps are positioned so that you need to thread them from the outside upward under your truck gate. It seems like it would be way simpler to use gravity and thread them from the other way. \n\nThe plastic buckles are located at the bottom of the inside section and I find it challenging to keep the GateMate from slipping and getting the buckles broken while trying to close the talegate.\n\nAt first I thought this was just me so I went back to the bike shop and they found this design extremely challenging. I have seen many other similar products on a recent trip out west. I am not sure they are any better but I would not purchase this particular product again.",
        "name": "Poor design!",
        "comment": [
          "Thank you for sharing your feedback on the Thule GateMate PRO.\nThe buckles of this product are on the inside of of the tailgate for two reasons. This limits the overall exposure to the elements by keeping them away from direct contact with particulate that could kick up from the road, and also acts as a mild theft deterrent by keeping the access system out of direct line of sight. \nThe positioning of the buckles themselves usually is dependent on the vehicle they are attached to. If there is an issue with the buckles catching in the tailgate, it is possible the incorrect size of the Thule GateMate PRO is being used. "

        "reviewBody": "Very impressed with the design, fit, and function of the GateMate PRO. It took a little fiddling with it to get it to sit on the tailgate correctly (I only had one set of pad blocks over the top at first) but once I readjusted it fit my RAM 1500 perfectly.  The straps took a bit of finesse to work through the gap between the bottom of the gate and the truck bed, but that is more a function of how the truck was designed.  I plan to keep a small piece of bent coat hanger wire in one of the pockets to help me pull the straps through the gap when I install it again.  The Cannondale mountain bikes we hauled sat neatly in the cradle of the foam pads and the straps secured them incredibly well to the truck.  For all of the goofballs that complained about the length of the strap in the other reviews - All you have to do is wrap the strap around the frame tube one extra revolution THEN thread it through the plastic ring and cinch it tight.  Makes me wonder how some people manage to find their way out of bed in the morning, but I digress.  This method of one extra wrap around the frame tube provides a really nice grip on the frame.  We drove a couple of hundred miles so far with the bikes strapped down and they don&apos;t wiggle or bounce at all.  The mesh storage pockets are a nice touch, as is the cutout that provides access to the tailgate handle and backup camera.  The material that sits against the vehicle paint is incredibly soft.  Sure, there may be cheaper options out there but they certainly don&apos;t appear to be as well-made as this one.  VERY pleased with the purchase!",

The gate is a couple of inches too wide to cleanly fit inside the frame of my Retrax tonneau, but because the GateMate is flexible I’m able to squeeze it in enough to close the tailgate. I might trim a bit off the sides to fix this. \r\n\r\nThe product materials are strong and seem like they’ll last a few years.

I have a camera body, extra lens, batteries, and few accessories and enough room left to feel contents are safe. I carry in the backpack or suitcase and haven’t had any issues (top of pouch can use a padding?) I also love the orange color material used it’s easy to locate everything inside even the pouch gets stuck bottom of my backpack. Well done Ranch! You are still crazy.",

Major issue that everyone on the web talks about is the tie-down system.  These straps ripped on the first trip and I will have to go to home depot to see how I can better secure the bike.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been a long time Columbia shoe buyer - winter boots, hiking, trail runners, and casual sneakers. I was ready for a new pair of waterproof hiking boots and purchased these in an 8W. For a wide they are really not roomy as others have commented, but I only have a slightly wide foot so they are doable (but not great). My biggest complaint is, I don&apos;t know what environment these were tested in for waterproofing, but it was not one that contained water. Walk for 2 minutes through dewy grass and your feet will be soaked. I even waterproofed them in an attempt to make these work - I think they lasted about 5 minutes. Not the quality I would expect from Columbia, now I just suffer on shorter walks with soaking wet shoes (think: you hear the water squishing each step) and deal with the swampy stink later.",

I was nervous to get a pair since I normally hike in tennis shoes, but decided I need more grip and ankle support to do tougher trails. These are the perfect hiking shoes for me because they are comfortable like tennis shoes. I hiked Seneca Rocks in WV (up 1,000 feet) and they were great. It rained the last 15 minutes and I stayed completely dry. I ordered .5 size up and they fit well.",

But I’m super disappointed in the service from Backcountry - I ordered this helmet over three weeks ago and it was never picked up by USPS. Custy service confirmed that it never shipped and was lost, but that there wasn’t a replacement available because it was sold out. They offered me a swap of another (not near as nice) helmet instead. When I asked about a comparable model, they said I could have it but I’d have to pay the difference (I ordered the first one during a big sale), which would have been over 50 bucks more.  Not mad at custy service because they’re always great, but this kinda sucks and makes me feel like I’m being penalized for a mistake I didn’t make. \n\nBut the helmet is great, I was ordering the same one I had before (which took enough hits that it was time to get a new one) - size chart is accurate and it’s light and super comfy!",

Improves comfort of bib straps and disappears once on. For such a thin, soft material it also holds up really well over time. I have a half dozen of these and the oldest is probably 8 seasons old and still kicking. \nRegarding sizing, I’m generally a L in cycling jerseys but find the M in this to be perfect. So if you’re between sizes, I’d size down.",

It prevents chaffing from my bib-shorts&apos; straps. It feels better than having a shirt on without it. I do not know if it keeps me cooler than without it as promised, but I definitely feel less &quot;clammy&quot; after a hard workout.\n\nCons: None really. It is another item to buy, another item to put on, another item to wash after finishing the workout.",

Lots of useful features like the side bottle pockets. I love the roll top because it keeps my laptop safe and dry, and it’s deceptively roomy. Highly recommended. I also have another Fjallraven backpack that I used daily for work for years, and it’s still going strong. I think they’re the best laptop backpacks around, and I haven’t even been paid to say this.",

But I ended up returning it after a couple days of work and school commuting and use. It does not have enough pockets and I keep losing items in the spacious interior. One more pocket on the outside and a hole for a hydration hose and it would the perfect backpack. \nThis backpack would be perfect for maybe a bike commuter (good in all weather and a narrow fit). Or this backpack is for you if you&apos;re the kind of person who can pack their bag without forgetting a million things, roll it up, and be set to leave the house.
