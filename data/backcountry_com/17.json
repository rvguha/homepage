I found the medium tight with just a hoodie underneath. It measured 17&quot; across the chest. The large fit more comfortably, however it was quite long on me. It came down mid thigh. It just didn&apos;t look great. The multi color is bright- great if you ski in low vis conditions. The orange though looked like I was wearing a cheap life preserver. The jacket did seem to have all the features one would want in a technical shell. The large measured about 18.25&quot; across the chest. It was a straight fit, so if you have curves it may be a bit snug in the hips.",

It looks great, keeps me warm, and has what you need. Maybe the only downside is no lower side pockets but when you have a backpack on you don?t go in there as much anyways. One of my favorite parts would be the thumb hole feature.",

I don’t want to use a cane because they make me look “old.” The poles fold into luggage and a tote bag so I can use them as needed while traveling. I need the tips for walking indoors. They work well. Back surgery is coming up, and I hope to be back on the trails by year’s end. I’ll still need the great poles. \n\nBTW, I live in Missoula, Montana, and many of use trekking poles rather than a cane because we refuse to give up.",

My tips needed replacing after all that work. This time around I realized that the rubber tip protectors would be a real benefit for the easy parts of trails to reduce wear on the rubber tips and provide a softer impact with little noise. The protectors slip off easily when the trail requires the more aggressive bite of the rubber tips.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vest has served me faithfully from New England grouse hunting to desert quail in Arizona and SharpTails in South Dakota. \r\n\r\nIts quality was proven last year when my GWP and I found ourselves in the biggest patch of sandburs I&apos;ve ever seen -- she could only make it 30 feet before her feet were absolutely packed with them. I cleaned her paws out three times before throwing in the towel. With 3/4 mile to the truck and sand burs as far a the eye could see, I decided to sacrifice my Ptarmigan bird vest even if it only made it part-way. I unzipped the top zipper of the bird bag and re-zipped it around her, hoisting her onto my back for the trek to the truck. With 55 lbs of bird dog, 2 pheasants, most of a box of 20 gauge and a bottle of water, I really expected to have the vest fail in some way. The zipper was the obvious weak point, but no dice. Even though it was extremely overloaded, it came through unscathed and got my dog back to the truck where I would spend twenty minutes removing dozens of burrs from each of her paws. This vest proved its quality that day. \r\n\r\nBesides the build quality, the simplicity of the big front pockets allows me to grab a handful of shells and dump them in, while seeds and other chaff can fall out the soft mesh bottoms. \r\n\r\nTwo front d-rings allow me to run my Garmin on a carabiner, while the dual side water bottle pockets are easy enough to differentiate from the back bird bag to be useful. \r\n\r\nThe bird bag is ample, with a top zipper that allows for easy cleaning. That zipper doesn&apos;t come unzipped like some, and the quality is far greater than it needs to be, as evidenced by my dog-carrying experience.\r\n\r\nEasily the best bird vest I&apos;ve ever owned, and it&apos;s probably the fifth or sixth vest I&apos;ve purchased. Especially when you factor in the reasonable price, I don&apos;t think you could find a better vest out there. I plan to buy another for myself and one for my dad.",

Contacted Kelty and they wont fix it and there response was “we don’t know of a company that can fix furniture” terrible customer service. Hoping Backcountry will correct this.",

        "reviewBody": "So there are two things that are great about this chair. The quality of the build and the cup holders. The steel frame is far superior to any other bag chair I have owned and the adjustable cup holders are fantastic for holding a drink and your phone. \n\nNow on to why I really dislike the chair. I am a taller woman at 5&apos;9&quot; and this chair height is WAY too high. I can&apos;t sit in the chair and have my feet touch the ground. I&apos;ve honestly never met a chair that I had this issue with before. The front of the seat angles up and just digs into your thighs and it&apos;s not comfortable at all. I read this complaint on a review on another site but brushed it off unfortunately.\n\nAnother thing that I don&apos;t understand is why the highest position of this reclining chair is leaned so far back. If it has the option to recline, why not at least start in an upright position. \n\nOverall I would not  recommend this chair at all. I&apos;m so sad I ripped the tag off and can&apos;t return it, so I&apos;m stuck with a very expensive bag chair that I won&apos;t be using. I will say that I also got the Kelty low loveseat in this same style and liked that better, so if you are looking at these chairs, maybe go for the low profile ones if you are under 6 foot.",

Having this in my camping collection has been very sweet. If I&apos;m looking for something to be sink into and laze in, this does this job. It has traveled with me across the land, underneath Cascadian peaks, spent many beautiful calm evenings along the Clarion River, and kept me cozy while sipping on tasty Shacksbury ciders as the backyard fire flickers. Highly recommend !",

This is the second one I purchased and I am not happy by having to dispose of it again because I can&apos;t find anyone to repair it.   After using them for about a year, the heater would not stay lit or it turns itself off.

These gloves are very comfortable and warm. Easy to put on, and easier to take off. The gloves have a small length strap stitched between index and middle fingers, and pinky and ring fingers. They function as tabs to pull the glove off your hand. Simple but useful. Your thumb can also be exposed. I normally wear a size L for most gloves, I purchased this in a size 10 and it was too big. Returned and bought a size 9. Absolutely recommend.",

The tire hits the static tire rest and won’t mount. For the love of me I can’t figure out what the design purpose of this is anyway, but it’s about 1/2” too small to fit my bike. Garmin’s customer service gave zero help, only stating that they “recommend an indoor training tire.”  Nowhere in their marketing is this stated. Nowhere in their own web page. The only choice I had was to trade out to a different tire which is obviously not as convenient as “mounting your bike easily.”  Total fail",

        "reviewBody": "Planning for a week-long trip without access to anywhere close, I researched the best ice chests and found the RovR with the best reviews versus Yeti, RTIC and others.  I wanted to love the RovR and “test drove” it in an easy evaluation.\n\nI followed the instructions exactly.  I brought the “45” into the house the day before; partially filled it the night before to cool it down; filled the chest with things straight from the refrigerator or freezer and then filled the remaining space with ice.  We traveled for 4 hours and stopped at a place with a refrigerator.  We removed all food and placed in the fridge or freezer.  The next morning, we replaced the food and topped the 45 off with ice.  We continued to our destination – also with a refrigerator and removed all the food.  The ice chest remained in an air-conditioned house for 5 days, with the lid closed and never opened.\n\nWhen we packed to return home, I opened the chest and had cool water and no ice.  The hope for 7 to 10 days with no access to ice leaves me disappointed and am returning it.\n\nWhat I liked about the RovR 45:  I like the “deep freeze” to be able to store foods I don’t want to get wet.  I like that the first day and a half there was very little melted water that drained out. I like the design of the slope inside that allows fast, easy draining.\n\nWhat I did not like:  1.  Obviously the 4 days of keeping ice from melting without opening the lid.  2. The handle design does not handle the weight of the chest, even when empty.  In the first, lower position for pulling the 45 up a small step, the weight of an empty chest will jerk the handle loose to the fully extended position.  Even then the handle is not “stiff” and makes handling the chest difficult.  I have better handles on a rolling suitcase.  3.  The capacity of the 45-quart cooler does not provide as much space for food as I would expect.  In fact, the REI description of the capacity is: “The 45 Cooler capacity is as follows: With the Deepfreeze dry bin installed: 24 cans and 10 pounds of ice in the main compartment and 4-6 bottles upright with other food stuffs in the dry compartments. Without the Deepfreeze dry bin installed: 60 cans and 10 pounds of ice.”\n\nI was packing, and would pack more than cans and bottles, and I did use 10 pounds of ice but took fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit.  I am thinking / wondering if the 45 is designed for a day at the beach rather than outdoor camping.  \n\nI hope you find my comments helpful and am disappointed that it is not the solution I need.",

It’s also filled with goose down, allowing it to be both breathable and incredibly warm. What I’m still blown away by is the weight- it comes it at under 2 lbs and compresses down into a very small pack. This is perfect for overnight hikes where every ounce matters.

It is extremely lightweight but still able to keep you toasty warm. It unzips two different ways so you can roll down the front flap or just unzip one side. It has snaps and bungee cords you can use to help lock in warmth and make sure you are keeping out the cold. The stuffing feels thin but that also helps it to compact and easily put back in the compression bag and storage carrier. This won’t add hardly any weight if you are backpacking into your camp. The size is great for one person but there is an option to zip two bags together to share. And I love that there are accessories available to buy separately for it like a pillow and an inflatable pad. Which if you are sleeping on rocky ground, you’ll probably want as this doesn’t have much “padding”. This sleeping bag is warm but breathable and for anyone who camps, this is expensive but definitely worth the quality to have.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had about a half dozen stoves over the last two years - all of which perform terribly.  However, none of the others, cost as much as the Basecamp, and none of them were as virtually useless in the wind. \r\nA lot of reviewers complain about the windscreen and the regulator.  The regulator hasn’t crapped out on me yet… the windscreen is in the rubbish bin… I am going to fabricate my own windscreen and see if I can salvage this stove.  As it is – we are talking about 20-30 minutes to make coffee in a percolator – meaning to boil water – and as for bacon and eggs… the eggs cook but only after warming my cast iron after a half hour or more to somewhat cook bacon. \r\nAgain, I’ve tried a lot of stoves. Due to the 19mph gusts I get here in Texas this stove is useless. I’ve used it in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, South Dakota, and a few other places.  I continue to use it because of what I paid for it – hoping to find a solution to salvage it. \r\nI am committed to fabricating my own wind screen to see if that makes this expensive hunk of junk usable.  I would not recommend, and I would not buy this stove.   My style of camping is overland 4x4 adventures and car camping.",

Agree with other reviews that the top half is not proportioned with the bottom half of the dress. I originally went with the size chart&apos;s recommendation of a small for me. ( I am a size 4, usually translates to a small) The dress was really big. Big armholes, way too much fabric on the bottom, it just looked silly. Exchanged for an XS. Much better top half but the bottom could have been proportioned better for a small person, Still too much fabric and the bottom tier is on the big side, but i think as hot as PNW Summers are getting, its going to feel as good as it gets without being out and out naked, haha. For reference; 5&apos;4&quot; 117lbs, 34B. The dress hit just at the knee in front, a little longer in back. Pro tip- if you are any bigger than a 34B, XS probably won&apos;t work.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this same dress last year in one of the linen fabrics in a medium and it fits perfectly (5’3, muscular and curvy). I was so excited when I saw the faded blue with the flowers because it would be perfect for spring.\n\nThe color certainly did not disappoint and is consistent with what is shown on the website however something was completely off with the fit of bust of the dress. Waist down is perfect, but the chest is incredibly tight and just about smashed me in and is completely different than the fit of last years version. I almost think the measurements were off for the top portion when manufactured. \n\nI was tempted to exchange for a large, but didn’t need extra room in the waist or added length so I opted to return. I am so bummed because it is such a cute pattern, but it was just not meant to be! \n\nHopefully the one I received was a one off, but I wanted to leave a review in case others might want to order two sizes :)",

While the large did zip up, it was just big enough around the hips wearing my jeans and one light shirt. With ski pants, long underwear, etc. it would have been too small. Big enough (extra) around the top but that is not unheard of for me.",

To me, that&apos;s a major flaw; I need that chest pocket for easy access to my phone, chapstick, map, etc). If I&apos;m wearing a climbing harness (often), the side pockets are useless. Please add a chest pocket! I&apos;d also love a hood on this vest. Otherwise, great colors and fits well.",

I lost mine weeks after buying and knew I had to replace it as soon as I got home, and replace in Larch! So light, careful the wind doesn&apos;t carry it away! I haven&apos;t wanted a vest for ages but gave this a try as I run hot, and it has converted me! If you are between XL and XXL, get the larger, it will be better for layering and flexibility, I did and I think it is why I love it so much. I don&apos;t feel stuffed in it, but it makes great fluff for adding to stuff sack pillows. You&apos;ll need more though, as it packs down quite small.",

The chest pockets are also well placed for easy access. I like that the guards that go over your boots don&apos;t have a hook on them but instead fit tight enough onto the boot themselves to hold strong without me noticing. \n\nZero hesitations in recommending these for anyone looking to stand in a river and slay trout.",

        "reviewBody": "I recently purchased the High Water Duffel from Mystery Ranch. I had been looking for a mid-size waterproof duffel to carry expensive gear in the bed of my pick-up. The truck&apos;s hard bed cover is lockable but not waterproof. I had tried other brands but was never satisfied so I returned them. I&apos;ve owned a Mystery Ranch Three-Day Assault bag for years and use it every day so when I saw that the company had introduced a 50 liter waterproof \r\nduffel I ordered one.\r\n\r\nThe bag more than meets my requirements. The giant central compartment swallows as much gear as I shove into the dry-zipper opening. The dry-zipper functions smoothly every time with no snags. Per MR,s recommendation I applied zipper wax. I utilized the dry zipper wax crayon that I use for my SCUBA dry-suit zipper. The High Water Duffel&apos;s main compartment is 100% waterproof, and has been severely tested in the short time that I&apos;ve owned it. The bag rode in the bed of my truck during a week long, wind-driven rain-filled Northern California road trip. The following week I used it during two days of outdoor range training occurring in continuous heavy rain and wind in Los Angeles. On both occasions the exterior of the bag was completely wet while the interior compartment and contents remained bone dry. But the waterproof exterior fabric quickly wiped dry with a towel.\r\n\r\nI like that the bag has minimal organization, which allows it to accommodate multiple large, bulky items.  As my rapid deployment bag, it is currently holding both soft body armor and a hard rifle plate carrier, gun belt, holster, pistol and rifle magazines, IFAK, helmet, and light breaching tools, There is still room remaining for a jacket, combat pants and boots. The bag has two exterior mesh zippered pockets--the bag&apos;s only organization--which is perfect for smaller items such as chem-lights, markers, flashlight, goggles, waterproof notebook, and a thirty-foot nylon strap. There are four external daisy-chain attachment points running perpendicular to the long axis. I have a carabiner attached which holds door wedges.\r\n\r\nThe bag can be carried as either a backpack or a traditional duffel bag. It comes with two quick detachable padded shoulder straps that can be reconfigured as a single duffle strap. There are also two reinforced carry handles on either end.  I couldn&apos;t be happier with this purchase. I&apos;m actually considering buying a second High Water Duffel to carry clothing and other items on long road trips and/or to carry dry items on the deck of an operational dive boat. Mystery Ranch hit it out of the park with this one.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve owned this for about two months and am overall happy with it.  There is a lot of utility with a waterproof duffel and the dimensions of this one (longer, broader, and flatter than most) that make it ideal for Mystery Ranch&apos;s Overload system was the main selling point.  Durable: I&apos;m confident the material will take a beating.  I drop it wherever is convenient.\r\nComfortable: The handles on each end are great for shuttling the pack short distances.  The backpack straps are more comfortable than I would have guessed.  I thought I would miss the handle in the middle of the duffel or a wrap to link the backpack straps, but I haven&apos;t.\r\nSimple: There aren&apos;t many bells are whistles.  The only thing inside are two compression straps, no pockets.  I kind of wish there were a couple pockets on either end/side.  You have the mesh ones on the outside, but obviously there not waterproof.  There isn&apos;t a flap, so when you open the bag it remains mostly closed.  Once you get the zipper going, it&apos;s smooth, but I do wish there were pull tabs on either end of the zipper to hold on while you pull the zipper open and closed.  It&apos;s not necessary, because it&apos;s a straight pull for the &quot;Tru&quot; zipper, but the tabs would make a better experience.     \r\n\r\nOr",

Its first use was on a late season float hunt where it spit rain and snow on us.  We also piled 2 deer into the boat on top of it by the end of the day.

This wasn’t the case when I put up the poles to have the front canopy, but high winds hit and I had to take those down. \n\nSpeaking of high winds, for some reason these screens deflect most of the wind. It’s pretty impressive. (Definitely tie-down your corners with rope and stake down the corners.) I just wish the middle of each side had a tie-down point to alleviate some of the dipping down the ceiling did with the wind. \n\nLastly, a huge storm hit. I dropped the walls and staked everything down. The corners aren’t exactly 100% water tight, but the walls did their job. \n\nI would definitely recommend this tent to anyone under 6 feet tall.",

I went out for a week of primitive camping at Dale Hollow Lake and was hit by severe storms and tornadoes that touched ground three miles from us.\nWhen the initial front blast hit us, it took out all our tents and equipment with tornado force winds. All but this Screen Shelter from Eureka. I am very impressed by it as it held up to those winds with very high speeds. it blew it hard too, but the poles and guy lines held tight. Everything inside was kept dry by the side walls which we put down when the storms came through. Only thing that snapped was one of the bungie loops holding up a corner but easy to fix. Very good job on this Eureka!",

It has doors on both sides so you can open both for a nice breeze, and shade which \nis great for a hot day.  The sides can all be completely covered for cool nights, or opened with screen for protection \nfrom bugs (even noseeums).\n\nSetup is easy for 2 but I can set it up by myself.  You can even put the doors up as a canopy.  We really love this \nscreen room, it looks good and is real versatile.\n\nOne big issue, otherwise 5 stars for sure.  It just hasn&apos;t held up, after about 1 1/2 years we have lots of issues with \ndurability.  We use the screen room in Florida in the Winter where it does get breezy and lots of sunshine.  From \nthe wind, the elastic connections at the top corners broke ( 3 of 4).  Three of the clip straps came off, I had to sew \nnew ones on.  The side material (not the roof) started dry rotting already.  We have lost a complete side, and 1 \ndoor panel.  The rest has many tares I have taped to try get a little more use before we discard it.",

It would be awesome if the poles for the canopy were adjustable so that when it rains the can just be adjusted downward.  We left camp to go for a hike and got a random rain storm we weren&apos;t expecting and left the canopy up.  We came back to the center pole snapped in half at one of the joints.  We didn&apos;t get very much rain, but the canopy holds water because it&apos;s waterproof (a good thing!). We splined it with some sticks and Gorilla Tape for the rest of our camping trip and that worked ok.  We just had to drop the canopy down every single time we walked away from camp in case it rained, which is kind of annoying.  The canopy held up to 50mph winds one night too without issue.  We get a handful of drips along the backside of the tent during heavy rain, but overall I am very pleased with the tent minus the snapped pole the 2nd day.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this bag a month ago for a two week trip to Japan. The bag is bulky and looks bulky whether it&apos;s half full or almost full. Either way I was able to travel on various size planes with this bag in the overhead bin or under the seat. I didn&apos;t get questioned at the gate but I did get questioned on size when on the planes but I was able to prove that the bag fit in both the overhead bin and under the seat. Unfortunately if you get asked to check the size at the gate, it does not fit into the baggage checkers when it&apos;s packed. But it does fit the airline baggage requirements online. So keep in mind that you may be asked to check it if they ask you at the gate and make you use the baggage size checker. The two issues i had were the seams pulling apart and the anchor straps kept coming undone and id have to reset them. I was disappointed that the seams on the bag started to pull apart on my trip when it was the first trip i used it on. I wish the seams were reinforced for a more durable bag to travel with when it&apos;s almost full and more durable for a longer trip. Overall, it is a good travel bag but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s one to be used on a 2 week international trip almost fully packed which is why I bought it.",

Could carry all the clothes and stuff I needed and pack up quickly, plus really easy to separate dirty and clean clothes. Would not use as a daypack just for walking around sightseeing but it is perfect as a quick compact luggage item.",

Comfortable to wear while full of stuff and a bit heavy. Only downside i came across is the water bottle holder does not hold a bottle secure, so when retrieving for the overhead bin my metal water bottle fell to the floor of the center aisle...really the only fault i could find. Only used for this one trip so far. Would recommend.",

This is loose grain, and now that it’s been about 3 weeks it is DEEPLY creased while the right boot has hardly creased at all. \n\nSo yeah, they are for sale on Facebook marketplace for 200 dollars because that’s all I’ll likely get for them.

I had previously owned two pairs of 1907s in a size 9 which fit perfectly, so I assumed a size 9 in the 8083s would too.  When I laced them up for the first time, I could hardly spread my toes and my foot felt very squeezed.  I figured this might be because they were brand new and just needed some breaking in.  But after a few months and I had to stop wearing them because they were literally cutting off circulation in my toes, causing them to tingle.  These feel WAY MORE TIGHT and NARROW than the 1907s.  Wish I had tried them on in a store before purchasing online.  I&apos;m still a fan of the brand/craftsmanship, but I&apos;ll be avoiding Iron Rangers.",

Unlike most black boots, these stand out through their pops of white stitching and the brown welt leather, and the iconic silhouette makes for one hell of a boot. Mine have been worn around and abused a good amount already, and aside from creases, they still look practically new. \r\n\r\nThe stitching isn&apos;t quite perfect in spots, but I don&apos;t believe an issue that only affects the look is a real issue at all. \r\n\r\nI rotate through my boots in order to keep the leather at their highest quality, but I mourn the days where I&apos;m not wearing my Red Wings.",

My previous Oakley helmet I used for three seasons, and the BOA dial worked perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately, I bought this helmet from Backcountry.com, and my experience with their warranty process has been terrible. I submitted a claim 2.5 months ago, providing all the required images and a video of the broken part, following their guidelines. Despite this, I still haven&apos;t received a replacement or any response from customer support. I will never buy from this site again.",

        "reviewBody": "So I have tried every helmet brand I can get my hands on. I have a narrow oval head shape and so far nothing has worked for me other than getting a helmet one size larger than I need that has a 360 boa adjustment and cranking it down to fit my torpedo noggin. Obviously this is t ideal and on this last attempt at research I saw this brand is as more narrow than others. \n\nThe good things: this helmet brand is many levels better than any other brand I have tried (Smith, Anon, Giro, Sandbox, Poc, Oakley, and K2). I think the only brand I have yet to try is Atomic. The quality of this helmet is amazing, this particular style was really heavy but they are not all that way. I also did find Sweet Protection to truly run narrower than the rest. Still not narrow enough, but it’s getting closer. \n\nNow for the bad: this brand offers a “boa” adjustment in the back, unfortunately it is not a 360 system, it only adjust for the back half of the head. This doesn’t really help me since a half system located in the front to back plane of the head will only remove slack in the  long section of my head, I need the adjustment to be side to side or better yet, the whole circumference. The other thing about the adjustment is that it broke within 15 minutes of me trying the helmet on. I’m not sure if the ratchet knob came loose from the adjustment arms and it could be reset, but this was incredibly disappointing for the price point of this helmet. \n\nI sent the helmet back and tried a different style from this brand. So far, the other style hasn’t had any issues but I am nervous that it is a matter of time before the dial breaks too. Ultimately , this brand is still the best that I have found but I’m not completely convinced there isn’t a better helmet out there that I haven’t tried. Time will tell if this one makes me happy.",

        "reviewBody": "Purchased the Trooper 2Vi Mips after purchasing the Switcher on a whim. Turns out the Switcher is designed for round heads. The Trooper fits oval-shaped heads (per recommendation from Sweet Protection). The dial adjustment on this helmet is stellar, but for some reason the Trooper does not ship with their padding kit (worth noting that the Switcher comes with their padding kit). I sent them a request through customer service and Sweet Protection sent me the padding kit free of charge—I&apos;ve got the fit completely dialed in. \n\nMy head measures 59cm—this is the limit of the medium helmet and I&apos;m here to tell you that the medium won&apos;t fit a 59cm head. The large fits perfectly and does not require much to synch the fit into place. Measure your head to get the best fit. \n\nThis is not a light helmet, but I never noticed it on the hill. It&apos;s built like a stylish tank. And you can buy replacement parts for the pieces that get the most use. \n\nThe magnetic chin buckle is super easy to use, but the best feature of this helmet is the hollow ear pads—there&apos;s a pocket for your ear. No more smashed ear pain after a few hours. Better still, there&apos;s a pocket in the ear pad for speakers. Most speakers are way to thick and wind up feeling like bricks pressed against your head. This helmet will accommodate all brands, including thick speakers like Chips, Aleck, and Alta ... ALL are way too thick for my liking. I have the BE Headware speakers and they&apos;re brilliant (thinnest insert speakers on the market).\n\nThe only weird thing about the design is that there is a vent on the sides of the ear pads that allows air to pass through. When you&apos;re skiing it can sound like a wind tunnel ... and makes for some cold ears on a chilly day. Speakers will mitigate the noise and air conditioning, but I solved the problem by inserting a thin piece of foam in the ear pad pockets cut to cover the vent.\n\nRolls-Royce of ski helmets. Worth every penny.",

The material is thin, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to keep me warm, and I think it looks cheap which is not what I expect at this price. In the past, I purchased another UGG cardigan (the Judith) and an UGG turtleneck (the Ylonda II) from this website in a similar fabric, but this cardigan&apos;s fabric is not the same as it seems to be an inferior quality. There are long threads at the seams that stick out, especially at the end of the sleeves and along the bottom. After I tried it on, I put my cell phone in the pocket and it made the front sag. That&apos;s one of my greatest criticisms of the UGG cardigans: pockets are large enough to hold a cell phone, but the fabric isn&apos;t strong enough to sustain holding one without major sagging. I don&apos;t care for the fit either because it&apos;s oversized in the armpit area, and the sleeves get wider from the elbow down which make the part around my wrists sag as if it were a bell sleeve. I used the size chart, but I think the sizing would have been better if I had sized down.",

That said, I&apos;m not built like a typical bike so putting a lot of torque and weight on this bottom bracket result in a lot of creaking noice due to movement.  I replaced my original bottom bracket with one of these earlier this summer and it only lasted a couple months before the creaking got too annoying.  I stepped up to the Wheels MFG threaded option to make it more secure and have had no problems or extra noise.  \n\nhttps://www.competitivecyclist.com/wheels-mfg-bb86-92-sram-bottom-bracket-with-abec-3-bearings-whl000q&apos;skidn=WHL000Q-BK-ONESIZ&amp;ti=UExQIENhdDpCaWtlIEJvdHRvbSBCcmFja2V0czoxOjc6Y2NDYXQxMDA0NjY=",

They rolled fast over the snow and had enough bite to feel confident on punchy uphills. Had some trouble getting them to seal up but once they did they’ve held air like a champ. Recommended psi min. is 29lbs. But I’ve been running them at 25 and have had no problem. For the money a good fast rolling tire.",

I have the Control T5 for the rear and Grid T7 in the front. The new ones appear to have a little more knob to them but I don?t notice any slower rolling resistance. The T7 is a little softer and does better on roots/rocks. They are very predictable tires and are my go to for mixed terrain when I still want to go fast. I used this setup for the Marji Gesick 100 in Michigan and seemed to be the best balance of grip and speed. No punctures and $30 cheaper than Maxxis and Schwalbe.",

Plus, they made my feet sweat, which made them cold. What was the point?\r\n Then I saw these slippers. It was almost love at first sight, but I am allergic to wool.  I clung to the hope that I would be able to wear it anyway.  is it possible that boiled or felted wool removes the lanolin? I kept all the packaging and wore them only while sitting down so as not to make them unsaleable if I had to return them, but as soon as I put them on, I was in love. They do not cause an allergic reaction for me, and they are everything a slipper should be.  As a matter of fact,  I&apos;ve almost stopped leaving my house because I don&apos;t want to put real shoes on.  It&apos;s only a problem if my family wants to eat, and I&apos;m trying to wean them from that. Cozy, odor free, surprisingly supportive, and I&apos;ve already gifted another pair to my sister.",

My summer house shoes are always crocs and my feet love them. When I first put on these, I expected them to be too flat for all day wear, but they have been perfect.\n\nI also expected them to end up with feeling bad without socks, but they&apos;ve been both comfy and not at all an unpleasant smell.\n\nThe soles are obviously not waterproof and they will darken and stain as they are used, but they haven&apos;t become slick, so they are still nice and grippy to walk around in.\n\nAll in all, durable, warm, and comfy, without any annoying bits.",

Addictions can occur.&quot; This was the seventh pair I&apos;d purchased. I got my first pair 5 years ago when we moved to a home that had all (chilly) hardwood and tile floors. I instantly fell in love and purchased a pair for four other family members the following Christmas. This year, I am gifting a pair to our latest addition to the family, my daughter&apos;s fianc°. And I replaced my original pair. Worn nearly constantly for 3 seasons of the 5 years I&apos;ve had them, they are wearing thin where my little toes like to stretch out. The soles are still completely intact, and the stitching is solid. I won&apos;t discard these old gray booties, but will wear them when I work in the basement or on days when I am likely to also step outside to the garage...cleaning and household chores days. I am already enjoying my new denim blue booties on my usual work-from-home days in my usual uniform of leggings and tunics. I am officially addicted. Love them!",

        "reviewBody": "The only part of the size chart you should pay attention to are the first two columns. I made the mistake of ordering my size based on my foot measurement in mm, which gave me a slipper whose toe box brushed right up against my feet. Weird, since on that chart the measurement corresponds with my typical EU size. Exchanging those for the next size up, Glerups&apos; equivalent to my typical US shoe size, was the better way to go-- the slippers are as cozy and comfy as everyone has already said. \n\nIt&apos;s puzzling why Glerups converts their EU sizes to a smaller US size than most other shoe brands. An EU 46 should convert to a 13, but Glerups for some reason sizes their 46s to fit a 12. But yeah, go with the Glerups equivalent to your US size and disregard everything else and the comfort shall be yours.",

This trainer feels very stable and I&apos;ve never had a problem connecting it to Zwift. You do have to buy a separate cassette that works for your bike, but can&apos;t really complain about that since it is a direct connect trainer. Truly a great trainer and worth the investment - whether you want to do structured training programs with Zwift or just train during the winter months.",

We are talking largest cog in back and small ring in front trying to get past the resistance or small cog in back and big ring in front looking to try and get some load !\n-after about 30 minutes of use you most likely will start hearing a rattling sound \n-Italian customer service responds but they will blame eveything except their machine or ask you to take it apart and send pictures of the magnets in motion or look for loose parts !\n-if you want a great trainer at a reasonable price point with great customer service try the Wahoo Kickr Core (btw, their flywheel is 11.9 lbs vs 7.7 of this machine.

Don&apos;t waste your money on a trainer that can produce watts you&apos;ll never produce. I am an avid mtn biker and occasional roadie. But I am not a pro cyclist. Producing 600-700 watts is a big deal for me, and not sustainable. Buying a machine that can produce more than 1900 watts is a waste of money. I don&apos;t use the Suito app (other than for calibration); its interface is not intuitive and clumsy. Connected to Zwift, the trainer is great. Re the wobble per another post, learn to adjust the feet. It&apos;s simple. Perhaps don&apos;t use it on floor tile that does not offer a smooth surface. I had no wobble issue with the drive. An added benefit, its smaller size folds up and can slide under a bed. This machine is being discontinued; buy it while available as a value.",

Unfortunately it has quite a bit of wobble when using it. I think it stems from its adjustable feet and from the unit itself.

I used the tent one night in light, low country terrain. Woke up to two holes in the floor. It seems there was a weight to durability issue. When I reported the issue to Jessica with Backcountry they made it right immediately. I have always appreciated their customer service. I was also informed they could not get the footprint in and that they were phasing the tent out. So I chose to return the tent for store credit.",

I really wanted to like this tent but the design has me scratching my head on why didn&apos;t TNF make the brow pole an exterior pole. If you are going to set this up while it is raining and you are by yourself, expect to be soaked by the time you get that pole in place. At least I would expect to get soaked. TNF, it is over a year, but please take this tent and footprint back as a return.

They market it a three season but you can definitely take this on super cold nights. Setup is crazy fast and easy. The material they used to make this is VERY durable. I forgot my footprint and for 10 nights didn&apos;t get one hole or anything. I was dry the entire time, no leaks at all. I believe this is the redesign. A lot of effort was put into the engineering for this monster tent. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get another tent. If you&apos;re hiking a long ways and need something lightweight and durable this is what you get hands-down. Light weight, warm and resilient. Don&apos;t mess around. For what you&apos;re paying for this is the absolute best deal on the planet. Get this lightweight monster. Thank you Northface",

As mentioned by others setting up the internal arch pole is tricky because it doesn&apos;t click in anywhere and is very difficult to wrestle into place, but that&apos;s not why I rate this tent so poorly.. Single wall construction tents just don&apos;t breathe well and even in dry conditions! On my first trip condensation builds up on the inside walls of the tent overnight soaking everything inside. On my second and last trip with this tent I was at Sequoia NP and it rained both nights, the walls are not waterproof at all and everything inside the tent got soaked, the floor kept water out but as the tent absorbed more water it started to run down the sides and pool on the floor. Don&apos;t buy this tent, or any single wall construction tent unless you like sleeping in a sec bag!",

It was wonderfully light to carry. For setup, it was a little difficult to place the front &quot;arch&quot; pole, as you have to place this tent inside the tent to secure it, but doable with a friend. This tent does not have a rainfly, and I was excited about the idea of a waterproof single-layer tent. Unfortunately we experienced storms with moderate rainfall, and the &quot;waterproofing&quot; did not hold up. By the second day of our trip, the inside of my tent was soaking wet, and a small puddle formed on the floor of my tent. This water appeared to be coming in through the walls of the tent (not condensation). TNF Customer Service was wonderful about sending me a return label &amp; issuing me a refund. If you are camping somewhere where rain is unlikely, this is a great, light tent. Unfortunately this tent did not work for me.",

        "reviewBody": "I slept 19 nights in this tent, temps of exposure between 40 and 98 F (4 and 37 C), two t-storms with torrential rainfall, and one night with a strong side wind.\nPros: This is the largest 2-person tent I have seen in decades. It is very light, packs small, and it dries fast. It didn&apos;t leak even once and only on one morning I had a little condensation on the lower wall. The poles are light and finally TNF installed quality shock cords. With the improvements I mentioned below, it will be an ideal friend for long backpacking or mountaineering trips. \nMinor cons: the color shows dirt very quickly, the thin floor fabric is a subject to a quick deterioration, the front door zippers open only one way, from down up - the vertical zipper, and front left to right - the horizontal one, and this feature makes the ventilation process of the tent harder. The vestibule zipper gets caught in the overflowing sleeve all the time. From a $550 tent, I would expect a waterproof zipper that doesn&apos;t need additional protection.\nMajor cons: the lengthwise pole that goes on the outside of the tent has both ends of the same, small size, which is a mistake. The one that goes into the sleeve should be definitely thicker. As you can see in the photo below, the pole will poke a hole in the fabric soon. The biggest flaw in the design is the width-wise/across pole that goes inside the tent. This pole must be re-designed and placed on the outside of the tent to make the final product functional. The pole is held in place inside by 5 Velcro straps. The Velcros are NOT able to keep the pole in the designated position  and the pole is constantly sliding down the tent - photos attached. The top Velcro is slowly pulling away the seal from the seam so it will cause the tent leak soon. It is very time consuming to place the pole and while doing it, you need to keep the door open, so if it&apos;s raining, you will get rain inside the tent no matter how hard you try to avoid it. I pitched the tent after the sunset once, and immediately had dozens of bugs attracted by my headlamp flying inside the tent. I can&apos;t imaging pitching the tent in really windy conditions.  \nFinally, if TNF makes the suggested changes, I will take this tent back. Otherwise, it is a return.  \nP.S. I can&apos;t place all the photos of the tent I have. Backcountry people, any suggestion?",

It is worth it to me to carry this weight, although with this I do not have to carry a way to boil water.  It does take a few times to figure out how to make the best cup.

We were concerned that his high arch would not allow him to get the boot on, but it was not an issue.\nWe were concerned about fluoride issues because toxic socks was what was given him red and swollen feet but because Keen boots are PFAS free, that&apos;s not an issue.

I am 5&apos; 7&apos; and 135lbs. The small fits nicely. I can wear a wool sweater underneath without issue, but there is not a ton of layering room. I bought it to fit this way. The sleeves hit at my wrists...I could have sized up to a medium, but I wanted a close fitting down jacket. I have worn with jeans and dress pants. It is pretty unassuming and looks good.",

I wear a windbreaker on top on extra cold days and it’s the perfect down layer. Quality is great I have never bought this brand before but it’s been great. Also had this on while it was raining and it held up great. I just had to shake it for the water droplets to come off!",

It is a bit puffier than a nano and would be a bit awkward under another jacket or sweater, unless you had a big shell to put over it. My main issue is that the sleeves are a bit short, I think they&apos;re shorter than the size guide as well. I have a 6 foot wingspan and these only go to an inch before my wrist. Really comfy fit and very cute otherwise.\nI also got the largest size and it fits just perfectly, not baggy and no option to go bigger. I am quite thin, although very tall so I feel like there should be some larger options.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve had a Rekanken for 6 years now. It looks brand new , I usually throw it in my laundry. Holds up very well. It has aged beatifully. I adore this backpack. Huge fan of the brand now because of this backpack. Never had a backpack that lasted so long it such great condition. Because it lasted so long , I bought the rekanken mini, for smaller version, the kanken No 2 for my laptop, the weekender qhich is awesome as a carry on even at airports, the sling which I use as a purse and the tote for groceries and stuff. I only use fjallraven now , cause you can never go wrong. It is made to last !! Also I feel like is very stylish , I only wear black and only hace the boack ones , the color hasn’t faded. Make sure to wash it every now and then in delicate warm cycle or by hand.  I love that it doesn’t take any space, and is super light.  I am surprised that for such small and simple handles they haven’t torn. I gave away any other backpack or bags that are not this brand , this is by far the comfiest, classiest and best. If I end up buying a new backpack ever again , it would be this same exact one just to renew, althought I have a feeling it can literally last a decade more , impressive Fjallraven.",

This is no where near as good as the original. The material is stiff and quite noisy when walking around with pack on. It just feels low quality too compared with my other one. It also has less features than my other pack. My first one has useful pockets inside and is nicely lined. The re-kanken doesn’t have any of this. If the sustainability credentials are important to you then re-kanken is an acceptable back pack. If you’re not too bothered about green credentials the original is much better!!",

When they came off the truck they were only wrapped in plastic. No protection whatsoever around the hulls. Also, we did not get the Kayak locking lids that go on the back of the Loons. We got the lid that is held down by ropes. I am disappointed for sure about this because we spent almost 3K on everything and I would expect to get something a with a little more damage control effort. Makes me weary of buying from here again. Customer service is helping me through the situation now and they&apos;re easy to talk to about it. But it still can&apos;t change the fact the above has already happened after waiting two weeks for these boats. :(",

I would definitely recommend it.  It tracks well, is stable and very fast compared to my 10&apos; kayaks.  My only regret is that I didn&apos;t purchase it at the beginning of the summer, but I am still looking forward to a fantastic fall of kayaking and fishing. You won&apos;t be disappointed!",

Two vestibules make it convenient for storing your gear, especially in humid environments.  Full mesh walls and ceiling make for a comfortable night with the large amount of ventilation.  The wide entry way on both doors allow for easy in and out of the tent.  Take down is quick and simple.  Its lightweight design makes for a comfortable hike from the truck to the campsite.  It’s also easy to strap on to your backpack.  You can’t mess up on the set up with the color coded system.  Even still, crossing the colors will allow for the rain fly to install and operate the same.",

        "reviewBody": "This is my 2nd Eureka 3 man. The first lost it’s waterproof coating after 9 hard camping years. The pass 3 is similar in size, weight and design . I feel it is harder to set up. The older model had 2 separate poles where as the pass 3 has one modular pole system that connects to a center hub which adds more weight and complexity to the tent. Also the plastic tab on the center hub that attaches to the peak of the tent was already broken. The fly and tent guy lines are not easily tied to the same stake like my older tent was. Also, the floor saver does not extend into the vestibule area to add as a external floor covering to store gear on under cover. I would not recommend this as a backpacking tent unless shared by 3 people who also share its weight of  6+ lbs amongst each other. I set this tent up once but chose to Re waterproof and  bring my 41 year old Eddie Bauer 2 man tent and shed that extra 4 lbs of weight. I would only recommend this tent for truck camping for young couples with one small child.I believe it is a very durable, comfortable tent for light Truck camping or for Scouting camps.",

        "reviewBody": "I have had this tent for a few months now and have been able to get it out on two different trips and a couple of backyard testing ventures. I bought this tent hoping to use it for car camping with my wife and dog, and hoping it would be light enough for some short\r\nbackpacking adventures. The size is adequate for the three of us (60 lb dog), perfect for just \r\n the two of us (me and wife, or me and dog), and is downright roomy for a solo venture. The design is so that it allows for extra headroom, which is accomplished by the use of an extra pole and a somewhat difficult to get used to zipper configuration (more on zipper later). The pole and tent set-up is very well thought out and is easy to set-up with one person. Thank-you Eureka for including a ground cloth! I don&apos;t know why more makers don&apos;t follow your lead there. After my limited use, it appears to be very durable and has kept me dry in moderate rainfall. Pitched once at 10K feet in moderate wind and performed great even without adding guy lines. \r\nThere are a couple of things I have found that were less than perfect for me and both are definitely livable issues. The first one is the color coding in combination with the rain-fly. If one follows the color coding as directed then you might end up with the bigger vestibule on the side you did not plan for. After taking everything up and rotating 180 degrees, I realized I could have ignored the color coding and just set the fly how I wanted. I&apos;ve done this a few times since and I have not noticed any issues. Second, in order to accommodate more headroom the zipper is quite difficult to get used to. Most of my experiences have been with zippers that are in the same plane, this one requires a zig-zag motion at the apex (where Eureka has given us more headroom). At first I thought it was going to be a game changer for me, because I kept thinking the zipper was getting stuck. I allowed it multiple uses before making a final decision and have come to learn that after a few times using, the brain must get used to the different motion. Day two of a four day outing and I had forgot all about it, but the whole trip I appreciated the extra headroom. \r\nThis tent has so many positive things about it, plenty of storage, versatility (can be set-up with just ground cloth and fly), ease of set-up, and decent weight for it&apos;s size. I would recommend this tent to anyone looking for a good 2-3 season tent.",

With two doors and vestibules it offers plenty of room but at a good weight. The full dome coverage provides great poor weather protection. \r\nSet up is easy, but set it up in the backyard before hitting the trail and not being rained on.  The main tent is a conventional symmetrical hexagon while the fly sets up to a specific orientation. Once you do a full practice set up-you got it. \r\nFor a 3-person, 2-door, 2-vestibule tent you can&apos;t do better for the price.",

        "reviewBody": "I have approximately a 24&quot;/61cm round head and these fit comfortably and snugly for biking or other physical activities. However even though Smith offer larger XL frame sizes in many of their styles and these fit as expected, I feel these could be offered in an even bigger, wider size. These fit very similarly to the Shift XL Mag even though that model is considered an XL frame. They should show a &quot;temple to temple&quot; dimension as lens width doesn&apos;t give you the whole picture. I guess what I&apos;d like to see is an XXL of the Leadout Pivlock that is wider in particular, for better coverage. Other than that, I think Smith could offer an even darker lens option to their darkest 10% VLT, like an 8% or even less - I only wear sunglasses when it&apos;s really sunny after all and 10% is sometimes not enough.",

I ordered this helmet (POC Obex Spin) in the M/L and it was PERFECT. I mean, as though it were made for me.

As I understand it from talking to the Gearheads, the SPIN technology is also top of the line when it comes to concussion protection, perhaps even superior to MIPS. The helmet is very comfortable around the head, though the ear pieces are pretty tight - I think they do this in part to ensure that your ears stay warm. The odd part about this helmet is the audio compatibility: it&apos;s only compatible with POC brand audio, not 3rd party, such as Smith or Sweet Protection,, and the POC audio is difficult to find aftermarket. Not many places sell it (Backcountry does not, at least currently), it&apos;s expensive, and there&apos;s very little information about how it works on the POC website (for example, are there any controls for volume or power on the outside, like for other brands? Who knows?). I also can&apos;t find an aftermarket bluetooth audio. I&apos;m not a fan of the proprietary audio, and I appreciate how most of the other helmet brands out there let you add your own audio. That said, if you are going to require proprietary audio, it should be easier to purchase. Were it not for this issue, I&apos;d likely keep this helmet, but as is it&apos;s a no go for me. I don&apos;t ride with audio often, but the flexibility to have music on the lift is something I&apos;ve become accustomed to.",

XL has been correct across Garneau previously and Castelli.  The quality is good, but they are too short-   I am not tall, and the bib straps are too tight length wise and they are short on the leg.

Like most bike shorts they get baggier over time. The pad is pretty comfortable, even for hours in the saddle on the trainer on a TT bike. I recently repurchased them (they were on sale) in a medium (I’m 6’0 168lb) Shoulder straps are way too tight, and the lack of decent leg adhesion makes for a short which rides up in a most irritating way. On the trainer or out in the real world, i was constantly hiking them down.  There are better options at a similar price point.",

        "reviewBody": "These shorts are *almost* great, but one design choice ruined them for me. The material used in the leg grippers - and also, inexplicably, a diagonal pattern across the front of each thigh - is terrible. Thin as a sheet of plastic wrap, almost totally transparent, and doesn&apos;t stretch as readily as the rest of the material in the shorts. Sent them back after a test fit - didn&apos;t even bother trying to ride in them. The fit is far too weird. \n\nIt&apos;s a bummer, because the main material of the shorts, the overall fit (sizing, bib strap length, etc) and the chamois all seemed top-notch. I wish kit makers would stop putting different materials in their shorts just for the sake of marketing. Went with the more basic &quot;Fit Sensor 3&quot; shorts, and while the chamois on those isn&apos;t as impressive, the shorts material is at least consistently comfortable throughout the entire leg.",

        "reviewBody": "I really like the overall feel of these.  The fabric is nice, the fit is great and they look good.  They don?t ride up or climb up you log like others.  Plenty of fabric while also being compressive.   Nice height up the torso as well.   I?d give these a 5 if they had a better chamois. The bibs are endurance but the chamois is not.  I have another pair of LG?s with the same chamois that I generally only wear on the indoor trainer.  These are better than that.  A sturdier chamois would make these perfect.  I?d say these are great for 20/25 mile rides when you really want to give it some gas.   I did a 50 in these today and my butt hurts. \n\nI picked up a second pair of these but in grey.   For whatever reason the chamois feels a little bit nicer.  The colored bands I could take or leave, but I would say I&apos;m more pleased overall.  I&apos;ve been riding The Black Bibs Plus before I got these.   I have a ton of chaffing from them and had to stop using them.   These have a much better fabric that interacts with my skin.  I wouldn&apos;t call it as high end as some other bibs, but this is a nice pair of bibs.   Both of them I bought on sale...if these were say $130...I&apos;d give them 5 starts.\n\nI picked up my 3rd pair of these on sale again.   The 3rd pair has the upgraded chamois as well.   My first pair did not last long.   They got a hole in them in the first year that I had to patch.   They have been relegated to &quot;indoor trainer bibs&quot;.   The 2nd pair are still great.  They are super comfortable but I don&apos;t love the grey bands.   Hopefully the latest pair, in black with the new chamois, is the best of both worlds.\n\nLonger term review here.   All 3 pairs have holes in them on the inner thigh.   Some on the right side some on the left.   I ride 3 different bikes, so I doubt there is something rubbing against on just one of the bikes.    Could have been the wash, could have been something else...but all three now have patches on them covering the holes.",

        "reviewBody": "It seems finding the perfect &quot;all the time&quot; bag has been more difficult than it should, until now.  I love this bag. The size is perfect. Large enough for me, without being too big or bulky.  The front outside pocket holds keys and chapstick.  Inside, various sized sleeves hold all the things.  I can even fit a kindle in a case easily.  I&apos;m sure I could fit more if I needed to, but if I don&apos;t need it why make it heavier.  Skinny straps usually start to irritate my shoulder and neck if there is a little weight to the bag I&apos;m carrying.  This one has yet to do that, and somehow it just stays in place.  The padded pocket in the back is perfect for my phone.  Tucks in perfectly and I can feel it vibrate if there is a call.  I love the fact that when wearing it, I can unzip it fully and nothing falls out.  (I haven&apos;t worn it as a hip bag/fanny pack....but I totally could.) Adjusting the shoulder strap is a snap. I got the gray, which the zipper pulls and branding have a slight blue/green tint to them.  I think this bag would work out for either gender just fine.  I haven&apos;t had it for very long, but I don&apos;t have any worries about durability.  I think I finally found a bag I will carry for a really long time. I think it&apos;s fantastic.",

The expandable pockets make finding things from the top very easy, snd the pocket in back is perfect for a phone. I was sporting an Osprey Daylite (6L) before, but this sits better on my hip and Carrie’s the same amount (in a 4L package).  All in all pretty happy.\r\n\r\nIs it perfect for longer journies like flights and hikes - maybe not.  But, for around town, it’s fantastic.",

I wish they made a District 6, just to add a few more things in there as the District 8 is too much visually to keep a low visual key in cities. My 5th Mystery Ranch bag, hard to imagine buying bags from anywhere else. Quality is solid, price is you get what you pay for, buy once cry once…",

It works as advertised and it&apos;s hard to find any fault with it.\n\nIt&apos;s flexible and breathes well so you don&apos;t get sweaty with it on. It&apos;s sufficiently and modestly wind resistant and water resistant. Light snowfall and sitting on snow didn&apos;t soak through and it held up fine against heavy winds (enough so that I didn&apos;t feel a need for a hardshell on top)\n\nIt&apos;s pretty durable and has taken accidental impalements with a crampon without falling apart,  likewise for catching it with an ice axe.\n\nIt&apos;s marketed as 3-season pants but I took it up Mt Fuji for a winter summit and it performed great. Great all around.",

But I still absolutely love being outdoors and going on adventures, I have never been able to find a pair of outdoor pants that would ever fit right. Let’s be honest, there are some really cool companies that only make sizes that stop at the XL size. Not OR, I wear a 48” waist and 34 length. And these pants fit so unbelievably well. I got them for a three week trip across Europe. We started in the rain in Amsterdam and finished in the snow in Zermatt. These pants fit every single occasion I threw at them. Warm when they needed to be, cool enough not to overheat, dry in the rain, and stretched perfectly on the slopes. Basically, they just fit right.",

Sadly I had to warranty both of them on account of the little zippers failing on the pockets leading me to sew them shut to keep from getting pocket fulls of snow.  Thankfully OR has a fantastic warranty and warranty service!!! Disappointingly they are still using the same zippers on these pants.\r\n\r\nI live and ski in Utah.  I wear these pants both the resort and in the backcountry and find the stretch and breathability of the pants to be just what I want while still keeping out the cold and wet.  I have ice climbed in them, and done mountaineering adventures in them.  While they can be too warm for summer missions and not water proof enough for winter attempts in the cascades they cover are just right the majority of the time and paired with a hard shell for full on blizzards are still my go to pants for snowy adventures in the mountains!",

I then realized it was kid sizing...and the tuber tan didn?t come in XL or XXL. I thought about risking a L but decided against it and so glad I did. I was so excited to see Backcountry stocked size XL and didn?t hesitate. The XL fits just a hair smaller than I?d like but I?m keeping it. I can wear it open or closed but I imagined an oversized fit. I can wear a sweatshirt under it comfortably but it looks a bit stuffed. The jacket is very lightweight but still warm. It feels like polyester the inside, but that will likely block the wind. The outside is not overly soft (which I am happy about). The snaps are plastic so even though it looks vintage it has a very light and modern feel.",

I fine that I can carry their bikes easily with my road bike or my FX2 Hybrid. Further, this version seems to allow for easier stowage for those times I am not hauling a bike(s) along.

On top of that, the grey &quot;padding&quot;, out whatever it is, rubs off and gets all over my bike frame. While this doesn&apos;t damage the frame, as far as I can tell, it&apos;s ugly and kind of disconcerting that it&apos;s coming off at all and makes me wonder when it will start damaging the paint on my frame. \r\nI recently replace both the arms (within six months) and the grey stuff started rubbing off almost immediately. I&apos;ve had to start wrapping some spare cloth around my frame to protect it.",

The Megneg can requires more PSI so I?m running it at about 215psi to achieve 30% sag.  I then added 1 (supplied) volume spacer to the negative air chamber and performance improved even more.  Very planted, controlled feel yet still plush over rough sections AND sits much higher in its travel.  Super impressed and Well worth the price !!!!",

As with most of the other Castelli kit I have, this jersey is snug and form-fitting, without being compressive and &quot;tight&quot;. I&apos;m slim and slender, and most other Castelli jerseys I have are size M, but needed a size L for this one. Another similar Castelli jersey is only a half-zip, so this full-zip helps with cooling on really super-hot rides. Also planning on wearing in upcoming cooler weather as a next-to-skin layer; it&apos;s snug enough that it shouldn&apos;t interfere with outer garments.\nAnother winner from Castelli!",
