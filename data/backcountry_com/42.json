One of the straps is almost completely off, mesh pocket inside not as durable as expected, plastic click-in device cracked easy and cooler liner wall busted. Was hoping to get at least 5 years out of this. I’ve always kept it up right. I’ve tried hydra flask bags w similar results. Not sure what to do at this point.",

I didn’t want the hassle of a direct drive trainer….I wanted something easy to install and remove, and I wanted realistic movement as static trainers often, well let’s just say make me numb in my nether regions🙂. So far the Rollr has met both criteria. It is very smooth and allows me to work on cadence and do “intervals”. I haven’t tried to do “hill work” yet, but may get to that later. I have not used it with Zwift or other on line services…I don’t want to pay $17/mo for subscription and my focus is not on indoor training—I want to get outside as much as I can. The Rollr allows me to easily switch to indoors when the rain comes, or I want to get my “ride” in before the sun comes up. Finally, I do have Garmin pedals for the power meter. More to follow as I use it more.",

        "reviewBody": "The Rollr is what everyone says it is. It comes in 2 pieces and takes no time to put together. It is extremely well made, solid, and a joy to use. Putting the bike on and taking it off takes no time. Not having to take the rear wheel off, deal with a messy chain, get grease on your hands (and then repeating all that to ride the bike off the trainer) are truly great. I can use my road bike (not some poor alternative bike) to train on and to ride. It also connected to my Garmin power meters right away, and to both Rouvy and Zwift with no issues. I let cadence and power go through the Rollr and only connected my heartrate monitor to the workout apps.\nOne setup matter to be aware of that takes more than 10 seconds is lining up the rollers and the front wheel well so that the tires sit evenly in both locations, with full contact. This takes some fiddling around, but once set, it’s done.\nThe one issue to be wary of is also why I gave it 4 stars. It’s really not the fault of the Rollr, but rollers create more natural resistance than hooking a chain to a flywheel does on other trainers. The result is that there is no easy coasting here. You’re at around120 power just  riding on flat terrain on a low gear. So it’s always a real workout on the Rollr.",

It is both baggy and soft and doesn&apos;t seem to work with real rock at all (its fine indoors.) Recommend the Furia S or Drago over this shoe if you climb outdoors.\n\nSizing is probably 1 -&gt; 1.5 euro size down from your regular scarpa size.  My street shoe is 44 euro (10 -&gt; 10.5).  I have the instinct vsw and furia s in 43 and got these in a 42.  41.5 would have been a better size",

They are an excellent all rounder for indoors and outdoors and at my skill level (intermediate) I rarely need anything more aggressive. I value comfort.  But when i started pandemic moonboarding, I found the kataki too stiff. I ordered the Scarpa Furia Air on a friend’s recommendation, and I love them on the moonboard. Very precise, sensitive, comfortable. The comfort was a surprise given their aggressive profile and tiny sizing. I initially purchased my La Sportiva size (37) but they were waaaaaaay too small. I sized up to 37.5 and I was worried they were still too small-they are a good half inch shorter than my Katakis and more narrow (see photo). They hurt to sit around in and my toes are pretty much bent in half, but as soon as I get on the wall they feel perfect! Glad i didn’t size up more than half a size.",

Unless you are doing yin in Finland, it will feel heavy and wet after practice. It’s a bobble magnet so although new, doesn’t look it after first use. And finally, the worse, the very annoying little fiddly button at the neck. “What  I really need is a small, fiddly, pointless little button  that does nothing for fuction but makes it a hassle to use the toilet or get changed” said no one ever. This is a total miss for me and I have something like 7 previous jumpsuits from SB.",

I have previous versions of the jumpsuit so bought straight away in two colors and if I was not abroad when I was still able to return it, I definitely would. Sizing about right, leg length is good and not seemingly too short. Sweaty Betty kept the shape from the long arm version (which is more bat-wing like) and the top is super baggy as a result. Honestly, am wearing this only out for dog walks into the fields near by and house work. Bit too expensive, but hey, my fault... Positives, the fabric is good quality and it is comfortable.",

        "reviewBody": "I have narrow feet, not super narrow, but narrow enough that shoes and sandals w/out laces or a means of tightening slide off. I wear Amalfi Ragone N and Munro N or M.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I wore Bushidos, but this time around the toebox just felt like it was squashing my toes. (I have bunions and have been working to spread by toes out more). The Karacals are perfect. My feet can splay out in the toebox, but the shoe holds my foot from sliding around.\r\n\r\nI actually had to call La Sportiva in CO to figure out which model would be the best for me. And they were very helpful and right on.\r\n\r\nI use the shoes for general recreational walking, on paths or over uneven terrain - not hiking or running (because I can&apos;t), but I can see how they would hold me from slipping if I were to do those activities.\r\n\r\nI also like how the heel has more cushion than in the front, so my toes can kind of grip the ground better.\r\n\r\nThe breathability of the canvas is also nice, especially in the toe area. I&apos;ve used them in mid 30s-mid 50s weather so far.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to watch out for is to order a size or half a size up. Depending on whether you use the European or the American system, the amount up will vary.\r\n\r\nIn Pikolinos I wear 39, in Amalfi Rangone 8N, in Munro 8-8.5 N-M, Onitsuka Tiger 39.5 or 6.5US (men), and in these, Karacal, 40 or 8.5US.",

I was concerned when I read on a shoe review website that the neck was a little high and it was rated 7 in terms of comfort, but I think this is an awesome shoe. They didn’t need any breaking in. I took them on a short urban 3 mile hike before doing a 12.2 mile hike two days later with a 3,900 ft elevation gain. They were so comfortable and had awesome grip. I have medium wide feet and normally wear a US 6.5 Adidas, 7.0 Nike, and I got these in 7.0.",

I will never have to worry about getting ice again and I love that. The build quality is great. The ability to charge via AC, DC or Solar makes charging convenient. Getting it cold doesn&apos;t take long. Since there is no ice, there is a lot of space for food and drink. It was 90+ at the race track this past weekend and it kept everything cold. Now the cons. It&apos;s heavy. When full I don&apos;t find it any heavier than my typical coolers with ice but it&apos;s still heavy when empty. It&apos;s big. I can&apos;t get it in my trunk from the back but have to slide it in through the back seat. Not the end of the world and worth the hassle but still not great. The battery won&apos;t last the 2 days that the website says it will. I&apos;d get about a day and a half. Stiff good but not what is reported. They must have set it up and not open the door for 2 days. \n\nOverall though... I would recommend. Especially when it is on sale.",

        "reviewBody": "So far, so good. The cooler just arrived, and the shipping was pretty fast. I set it up in the family room and put a thermometer inside to test for temperatures. I ran it overnight on wall outlet power and it maintained the 40 degrees I had set it at, and it also fully charged the battery. Next, I disconnected the wall power to see how it runs on the battery. It immediately switched to battery power. I let it run on battery power for over 24 hours. It continued to maintain the temperature setting, and after the 24 hours the battery was at around 40%.\n\nNext, I need to test it in my 4Runner running off of the 12-volt car power. This is the primary reason I purchased this, is for road trips. \n\nThe only thing I was a little disconcerted about was the temperature readout on the unit fluctuated a bit more around my set temperature than I expected from reading the manual and online FAQs, going down to about 32 and then back up to around 40 where I had it set. The online FAQ indicated a ±2° cycle around the set point without indicating units (Celsius or Fahrenheit). I suspect their FAQ used Celsius which would explain why the fluctuations in Fahrenheit would be larger. In any case, I don&apos;t think this is a big deal; they just might want to clarify the temperature units in their online article on the topic.",

I’ve been using the Burley Travoy trailer with my ebike and it completely replaced my car for grocery runs. With it, I can forgo using the shopping cart and have all my groceries safely packed away while shopping. No more forgetting my shopping bags because the Burley market bags can be attached to the trailer. Halls the heaviest load. Comes with secure pockets for smaller items. Packs away neatly into a smaller size when not in use. Say goodbye to expensive gas: car dependency is a thing of the past!

For reference I am 5&apos;2&quot;, 110lbs with a 14.5 &quot; torso. I really like the floating lid, ice axe carry system, and water resistance of the material. The big winner was the fact I could take out the frame sheet after a heavy load and turn it into a day pack that felt quite comfy and tilt my head all the way back. The harness fit well except the shoulder pads were a bit wide on me so it restricted my overhead arm movement. I am a small person so this is common. Overall nice pack but I ultimately chose a Hyperlite pack. The return was easy and I had great customer service with North Face and will definitely buy from them again.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Seems like they designed a good product and then never field tested it. Works great as a 50L pack, but filled to the brim it&apos;s not so great. Crampon pocket doesn&apos;t actually fit crampons when fully loaded, wand/picket pockets get turned outwards when fully loaded so they don&apos;t work great and would only hold about 10 wands (they need to come up higher and/or go out further). The one gear loop and one hip pocket setup absolutely baffles me. If I&apos;m racking climbing gear, I want it on both sides. Jansport seems to be the only ones who have figured out that you can put on a pocket AND a gear loop so that either can be used based on preference. Ice tool carry is ok, though I prefer the security of buckles over the hook system used here. It&apos;s been more of a problem on my Prophet 100. Some great features like the side compression straps can unclip and meet on the back of the pack to carry a snowboard/snowshoes/other bulky items, though those same side straps are way too small to carry a full-length z-lite foam pad. Carries weight comfortably, seems like a good balance of weight vs durability and generally has a streamlined design with just enough features. The redundancy of the rope carry/top closure straps is a bit annoying but thankfully you can just take one off, and I do like that it&apos;s only one hook that attaches to the lid of the pack rather than 2 buckles, and the lid is fully removable quickly with buckles to pare down or carry around at camp. I think if you plan on it being a 50-55L climbing pack and you rack gear on your harness you&apos;ll be pretty happy. If you want something to carry a fully loaded 65L you&apos;ll be disappointed. As a ski pack you&apos;ll definitely compromise with no avy tool pocket and no backpanel access, but it&apos;s not designed for that.",

To start, how it rested on my hips was amazing. I have almost no hips, very small hip bones and am 5’8” with a bit of a gut but the pack fit tight and sung around may hips and waist and took the pressure off my back. I had ~ 50 pounds and it never felt like a burden. At one point I had a 15lb dog started to my chest and I felt the dog more than the pack. The size is excellent for stowing all the essentials, including a bear bin. The back padding allowed by decent ventilation which is. Important because I sweat a lot. Overall a great purchase and look forward to taking t out again this winter.",

        "reviewBody": "The Mystery Ranch Bridger 55L has been an absolute game changer for me. When I first started backpacking and hiking. I bought a huge 85 L Kelty Asher and after the first few miles into the trail my shoulders would be killing me and the weight would never seem to shift in the right place to get a comfortable carry. After multiple times trying to find the right weight and strap configuration I had started looking for another pack. \r\n      \r\n\tSo I started asking around and shopping online to find the perfect pack for me. At first I was worried about the cost, then the size, and then style. The amount of options that are out there are insane and I would find myself discouraged and overwhelmed with the amount of options and then just inevitably stop looking to buy a new pack. When I was watching the reviews that other creators were talking about and the one that stood out to me the most was the Mystery Ranch Bridger 55 L. \r\n\r\n\tI was so worried and excited about the new pack all at the same time. After buying a $300 + backpack, I was suffering, I couldn’t wait for the back pack to get here and at the same time there were moments of doubt and thoughts of “ what makes this pack any different from the other 5 packs Ive tried? “, “ Is this pack going to be worth the money? &quot;\r\n     \r\n\t At last, the pack arrived, of course while I was working, and I couldn’t wait to get home to unbox and see all the cool things I had seen on the reviews. I got home and immediately opened the box and started checking out the new pack. The very first thing I noticed was the materials, everything the pack is made of looks and feels super durable. The next thing was the style, the pack looked awesome for the color I chose. The next thing I noticed was the amount of detail that went into how this pack was constructed. Then I started to think about how I was going to pack all my gear into this pack. And then the oh crap moment hit me.\r\n\t\r\n\tI started opening up the pack in the way I watched others open the pack and that’s when the zippers really impressed me. Gliding like butter and rugged to the feel. Then the moment came were I was doubting that my gear was going to fit in the pack. I started loading the pack and repacked it 5-6 different ways until I came to what works for me and to my amazement I still had room to add more. I had always bring a camp chair and a table with me but had stoped due to the weight and the other packs digging into my shoulders. With the additional room I had in this pack I went ahead and loaded my chair and table. Then came time to weigh the totals for my pack. Mind you that I bring an average of 65 -70 different things with me in my pack which is a tone of stuff but not really. I set up my pack for 10 + days and nights out including food and I was nervous about the weight but the total weight was 38 Lbs. I put the pack on my back and started the adjustments. Soon within about 45 min I had a comfortable carry. \r\n\r\n\tI was thinking that I didn’t pack something as this pack felt like nothing was on my back. I looked around and even went through everything in my pack and everything was there. This made the urge to get out on a trail even more desirable. \r\n\r\n\tTime opened up and so my wife and I decided to go to the Emery Creek Fall Trail in Chatsworth GA. Out on the trail the pack was preforming wonderful and was such a great experience as I could finally say that I found the pack that works for me. Mile after mile goes by and the pack was there but caused no issues with hurting my shoulders, hips, or back. We got to the area were the falls are at about 4 miles into the trail and set up a picnic and relaxed. The pack sat on the ground easy and did not seam to carry dirt on it after moving it around to get different items out to use. Hours pass and we packed back up and headed back to the trail head. All the way the pack preformed great. I can’t wait to take the pack out this Fall to explore more of the outdoors.\r\n\r\n\tThis pack has a running vest style sternum strap that really helps distribute the weight around my body. Items are easy to get too and overall I am extremely satisfied with what Im calling an investment and great addition to my gear.",

The belt is quite robust and I&apos;ve carried this pack of comfortably up to about 40 lbs.  My nitpicks: I wish the back mesh panel was a looser weave so things could dry out more easily.  The bottom straps are about 4 inches too short.  I wish one of the side pockets were larger and deeper, to allow carrying a tent more easily (Durston x-mid pro in my case).  Needs a water guard zip on the brain as well.  This is a heavy pack, but carries like a champ.  Great for trips with lots of luxury gear like a 2-5 camping trip.  This is too heavy and feature rich for extended through hikes (imo).  Would love to see a slightly pared down version in Ultra 200 hitting the 3 lb mark.",

The organization options made the inside feel more spacious than 55L, to the point where I was concerned I was forgetting something because there was too much room left. It carried the weight well and the load always felt well distributed. The many exterior pockets were nice too. My only complaint is that the outside straps on the bottom of the pack are a bit short. They almost did not fit around my tent. Even just an extra inch would have been nice. Minor issue though.",

I’m curvy, so it’s not surprising these are a little loose in the waist, but I wear a belt and they’re perfect! I hope some of the other colors are stocked soon, I’ve really found a winner here.",

        "reviewBody": "We just received the tent and excitedly set it up in the house and WOW, it really was a breeze to set up! I&apos;m taking my daughter on a two night camping trip with Girl Scouts and we needed our own tent.  This one delivers on ease of setup (just lay it out and lift the middle ~30 seconds) &amp; disassembly.  It was back in the bag in less than 5 minutes. The bag is roomy and it wasn&apos;t a fight to get it back in.   We bought some low cots (6in off ground) so I think this is a great tent for two people.  I cannot imagine 4 though.  I would. be very interested in purchasing a much larger version of this so that our entire family could stay in one tent...I hope one is in the works :)",

The poles are integral with the design,  so there is no assembly. No hassle of trying to put poles together and thread them through the material. You basically just pull up the center piece like an umbrella and you have a tent.  You do need to steak it down along with rope tie downs. That is the only part that takes a few minutes. The tent is very spacious and my kids love to use it for play in the back yard. I let them do that mainly because of the ease of set up.",

I also really like the hood shape and size. As other reviews point out, the arms are snug, which can be a drawback if you have bigger arms. The chest / side seams are the deal-breaker for me. The pullover has stiff seams that intersect with the chest in front of the armpit and run down the length of the garment. However, on someone with narrower shoulders / lats, the seam placement and construction cause the seams to fight back against arm movement, totally negating any benefits of the stretch material. Raising my arms above my head, for instance, caused the pullover to lift up above my belly.",

Really aggressive but perfectly functional shape. The lace system is exceptional, easy put on and off, crank down on feet like nothing else. They are comfy out of box (actually for me more comfy then ZenPro which are also awesome). Really good precision on toes, heel is super sensitive but less powerful than ZenPro which has more structured heel cup - I prefer Phantoms heel, it fits more precise, and the heel rand is pain free (zenist pro goes tear my achilles after hour) Smearing is for now average but for me good enough. Really special feeling shoe, worth the hype. For me all I need - I will stick with these for while.",

However, it had something to improve for me:\n- Heel (it was a bit baggy)\n- Centered toebox (my big toes got tired a lot and started to hurt at the end of the sessions)\n- Enough support on the small/sharp footholds.\n\nPhantoms solved all of the above. Heel fits me perfectly, and I&apos;ve used heelhooks on the holds I&apos;ve never thought it was possible for me to do so before. Toebox shape is great for my big toes health (considering I have a previously injured one). They don&apos;t hurt after long sessions, like they used to. And needless to say a stiffer shoe provides more support.\nI was going for Zenist Pros first, because I was afraid that Phantoms wouldn&apos;t work for smearing. Zenist Pro didn&apos;t fit me well (I couldn&apos;t squish my feet through the high toe rubber patch), so decided to stick with Phantoms. And to my surprise smearing is great in them. Somehow it works and provides enough sensitivity despite being a very aggressive shoe.",

(I don&apos;t, but after two concussions, one bike riding and another skiing, I thought I&apos;d better wear one.) There is only one problem: the wind blows in around my ears and is rather chilly. That&apos;s OK when it&apos;s 35 degrees out, but I ski in New England and it gets REAL cold here. So now I&apos;m looking for a beanie to wear under it, against all advice, and contrary to the common wisdom that &quot;helmets are warmer than hats.&quot;",

        "reviewBody": "The first thing that strikes you taking the bag from its dry bag (nice touch) is the immense loft from something so small in size. It kept filling up beyond what I thought possible. Next is the quality. It might be ultra light weight, but every element feels just right. The bag reduces grammes in several techy ways, but it&apos;s the shiny interior that stands out. Imagine a breathable cloth version of one of those emergency foil blankets they throw round marathon runners as they finish. Warmth is excellent. First time out was -8°C which is right at the edge of what RAB says is meant to be perfectly comfortable and - yes! - I&apos;d say that was a cautious rating. The baffles and drawstrings are simple and the zip is small, but I found these all worked intelligently and was a good balance for what is a seriously featherweight bag. I&apos;m struggling to find a negative in the bag itself. Price is expensive, but it&apos;s a RAB bag you&apos;re buying - and top of the line.",

They are the best bibs I have ever own. I&apos;ve had a lot issues with chafing and saddle sores, especially as I&apos;ve been building up my ride distance. These bibs have helped tremendously. \r\n\r\nMy one critique is that I still prefer to remove my kit for restroom stops. I don&apos;t love the drop down feature but it will work in a pinch.",

The fabric is silky smooth with just the right amount of compression and I love the laser-cut leg opening and minimalistic leg grippers. The fit is slightly more generous than most of the Italian brands, so if you&apos;re looking for a truly compressive fit, you might want to size down. My only gripe is that after a few washes, the mesh front has attracted a bit of dog hair that is impossible to get out. But overall, these are amazing and will definitely be working their way into my regular rotation.",

I actually like the smaller size because it’s easier to transport and place in an easy to reach area without taking up too much space. Insulation was exactly what I’d want out of a cooler - drinks remained cold for pretty much the whole day, and the seal is strong - no leaks were apparent. The aesthetic is classy, vintage and practical, which I love. The build itself seems to be really good quality - the handles and latch are sturdy metal and I’m not worried about either mechanisms breaking if handled too roughly. The built in bottle opener is a nice touch as well. Very pleased!",

The 1900 Collection has all the charm and feel of the vintage models in a shiny new advanced package. This cooler is very classy looking! It is the perfect cooler to take along for a day at the park, out on the boat, or anytime you would like to have cold drinks stashed away on the go. \nThe cooler is featured in a nice black metal and gray color scheme, featuring brass and steel hardware and hinges with a stainless steel lid. On looks alone, this cooler is a beauty! I am pleased to report that it functions as well as it looks. \nThis cooler is compact and reasonably lightweight. If features steel-belted construction, making it very durable. It will hold an entire case of 12 ounce cans plus ice, and you will still have a little room left over for some extras. \nWe typically purchase rotomolded coolers, which are obnoxiously heavy, but effective, so were skeptical about the capabilities of this cooler. The cold time on this cooler did not disappoint. It successfully kept our drinks ice cold for our day trip and we were overall quite impressed with its functionality. I expect we could get at least a day or two of cold. The weight is very reasonable and I could easily carry it empty and manage to move it when full, making this an excellent choice for a grab and go cooler. \nIf you are looking for a really aesthetically pleasing, but also quite functional cooler, the Coleman 1900 is a great choice!",

It looks really cool and expensive thanks to the metal body. It is convenient to take with you on picnics or the beach - the size is optimal, not too big and not too small, about 6 bottles of 1 liter fit plus ice. \nThe insulation is excellent: we left in the morning and returned late in the evening, the drinks remained cold throughout the day, even in hot weather. The lid closes tightly, nothing leaks. Of course, it is a little heavier than plastic models because of the metal, but for me this is not a problem - on the contrary, it feels reliable and sturdy. \nOf the minuses, I will note that it is still a bit small for large companies. \nIf you are looking for a quality cooler for short trips, this is an ideal option.",

Sunglasses for me fell into that area. My, um, mature eyes could no longer pick up detail under the trees when riding single track, and definitely could not adjust fast enough to changing light conditions going in and out of the forest with normal sunglasses. Yes I tried other photochromatic glasses, but they just did not change tint fast enough. These are different. They go from pretty close to clear in the woods to plenty dark enough in the open. They have given me back the ability to ride with sunglasses instead of clear lenses. I have been impressed with how incredibly crisp things look when using these glasses. That was an added bonus, The fact that they seem to walk a nice line in terms of blocking wind, yet not fogging up has also been great. I often forget that I am wearing them. Yes the price is premium, but worth every penny.",

My eyelashes touch the lenses when I blink, which is annoying. More importantly, on climbs when I’m moving slowly or when I stop, they immediately fog up (again because I think they’re too close to my face). I’m using them primarily for mountain biking in New York where it can be humid but it’s not the PNW.\nI also separately bought the photochromic replacement lens (didn’t come with the color I got), and they really don’t get dark/transition well at all. Smith claims 20-85% VLT. I’d guess more like 60%-85%.",

Also, maybe I just sweat too much, but I&apos;ve had to start carrying a microcloth on my rides to keep the lenses clear of sweat mid ride...even when wearing a Halo band under my helmet. \n\nWith that being said...Smith has world class customer service.

This tent is incredibly light weight and suitable for air travel. It conveniently packs up into 3 small stuff sacs that are provided. Freestanding is great, especially when you&apos;re trying to set up on a wood platform. Most of my camping is during the summertime months or in warm climates. I brought this with me down to the USVI and the screens gave me plenty of airflow. I had zero issues with moisture. Personally, I do miss the optional zip up and down windows. I think that option would afford an individual a bit more privacy and night time warmth. As of yet, I haven&apos;t personally tent camped during a heatwave.",

The Telos is about the same weight, a bit less bulk but considerably roomier on the inside both floorspace and headroom-wise. Important consideration is that the Telos is free standing whereas the CF absolutely had to be staked out. Not a big deal on a forest floor or meadow but much of our useage is streamside, sand and gravel bars. As usual, Sea to Summit&apos;s design and engineering is thoughtful and innovative, down to simple things like color coding parts and the modular stuff sack. These guys make crazy good stuff!",

        "reviewBody": "This tent worked perfectly. I took it on a week long canoe trip in Maine last week. Had a mix of weather conditions. Two nights dropped to freezing with a heavy frost. One night had heavy rain. The fly cinched down very nicely and nothing got wet. Tent is super light and packed nicely into one of my dry bags. Once set up it was very sturdy in the wind and rain. Im 6 ft tall and liked the wide area for head room and I didn’t have issues getting in and out. I would definitely recommend buying the ground tarp which actually attaches to the tent frame itself so there was no slippage and nothing hung out with the rain. I also got the gear loft which was nice for me because I always seem to loose things while sleeping. Overall I would definitely recommend.",

The guy lines are also incredibly easy to use, although I&apos;m curious how long they will last. \n\nWhat keeps it from five stars is the stakes aren&apos;t as durable as I would&apos;ve liked (wife bent one the first time using), and the hangout mode setup is not practical for a single person in anything but dead still wind, a slight breeze makes this thing difficult.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TL;DR - Really roomy and comfortable, lots of clever features and tons of storage space. Tent and fly bags are too small and make packing the tent up difficult.\n\nI was very excited for this tent. The amount of clever features was intriguing to me. As advertised there is headroom to spare inside the tent, and it makes a huge difference compared to other tents. Much more comfortable when changing, or just hanging out inside. The addition of using the tent bags as storage sacks inside the tent is great. S2S even provided mesh pockets already so the tent bags are just extra bonus storage space. If you bought the gear loft then it&apos;s a game changer as well. \n\nThe only con I really have about this tent is the size of the bags for the tent and fly. They&apos;re just too small, which makes rolling up and packing the tent away a fairly annoying process. It feels like there&apos;s no room to spare so if you don&apos;t roll it up just perfectly tight enough then it&apos;s going to be a struggle, or impossible, to get back in the bag. And if you manage to just barely get the tent and fly in then the sleeves for the poles are likely to be too tightly stretched to get the poles in.\n\nAll in all I&apos;d recommend it but practice rolling up and packing the tent away before going out to camp.",

I don’t know if it needs more directions or needs a more straightforward center pole system but was helpful to watch a video beforehand.  After retiring my MSR system  this was definitely a different level of setup.  \n\nIt’s reasonably lightweight- was good for our family but with 3 young kids we haven’t ventured into backpacking trips yet with them so used it for car camping.  The footprint that we purchased separately was key.  \n\nOverall, quite pleased.",

The way it sits in the bag is great.  We did experience some condensation on the inside with the vents open. But we did have four people inside the fly was zipped up and it was not very windy out. Overall highly recommend for hiking trips where light weight and a multiple person tent is needed.",

I primarily use tents in the high sierras where tent stake use may not be an option in the hard packed soil with rock. \nMy last trip out I had to find rocks to hold my stakes down for my fly. If I had this tent at the time, I don’t think the rocks I found would have been enough to hold the tent flat. \nIf I could return it, I probably would, and purchase a free standing tent. But I the site doesn’t look like I can. \nIf you camp in an area where tent stakes are easy to use, I believe this tent will be very nice due to its ease of set up and space inside.",

Honestly, I couldn’t tell what the ride was like because my feet were screaming less than a mile in. There’s really no substance to the upper and no matter how much you loosen the laces you’ll get zero relief. Poor design and even worse quality control. This shoe never should’ve left the drawing board. Are they light? Sure. But if they’re saying weight is at such a premium that they can’t put cushion in the upper, particularly the tongue, that’s a devil’s bargain. An extra ounce isn’t going to make one bit of difference. The true reason is probably cost and speed of MFG. Sorry, Craft. I really wanted to like these, but WOW. What a miss.",

After setting up, lots of water was inside the tent and that made for an uncomfortable night. The great thing about the tent is that its light, its easy to pack up, and its strong. We had tropical storm winds of 60MPH and higher and the tent held up to the wind. The tent is also strong, its tough enough to handle a high wind and small debris hitting it. This is helpful when high in the mountains.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought this tent for a Denali expedition and have also used it backpacking &amp; for summer alpine adventures (above 9,000ft). \n\nFor Denali, I was glad to have brought this tent &amp; would bring it again. I put seem-sealer on all the seams for extra strength, brought lots of guy-lines (only ended up using about half of them), and practiced setting up the tent on some backpacking trips to get a feel for it. On Denali, I really appreciated how fast it was to setup (about 5 minutes) so we could get out of the cold faster. It had lots of strong &amp; reinforced tie-down points (appreciated their toughness as pulling/chipping frozen guy lines out of the ice wasn&apos;t always easy). The tent poles/structure is pretty rigid when setup &amp; the tent fabric is also pretty taught when setup so it didn&apos;t need much guying out and it didn&apos;t move/shake as much in wind (ear plugs were still nice for high wind). The bright yellow tent material was great for team moral on stormy days (always feels bright &amp; sunny inside the tent). The yellow Todd-Tex fabric felt pretty tough and waterproof (the yellow Todd-Tex fabric over the main body seems more waterproof than the grey vestibule material which feels like it maybe has a urethane coating on the inside). The yellow Todd-Tex fabric did get a lot of frost/condensation by morning (mostly just by our heads). I brought a spong to soak it up, and that worked perfect. The tent fit 2 very comfortably with all our winter-camping gear inside along the perimeter of the tent. Fits 3 with some winter camping gear in both vestibules. We fit 5 with no gear in the tent while playing cards during storm days. \n\nFor non-snowy summer alpine adventures (above 9,000ft), it fits 3 very comfortably with summer gear in one vestibule. Can get a little hot inside in the middle of the day, but it&apos;s nice to be a little warmer at night. The large vestibule has a U-shaped zipper that is a little harder to enter/exit in the summer (b/c you can&apos;t dig a snow pit in front of the door), so I usually have guests use the other vestibule (with the straight zipper) to enter/exit.",

        "reviewBody": "A true 4-man 4-season expedition tent.  The pole design is rugged and the materials are tough.  The weight is very competitive for a 4-man 4-season, in part because of the single wall design.  Condensation is always a risk with a single wall design, but so far none of my expeditions in the North Cascades have suffered from any significant amount.  As far as the size goes, this tent does accommodate four medium-size climbers without gear.  I prefer to limit the party to three, which leaves a little room inside the tent for essential and eliminates the need to climb over your partner when entering/exiting the tent.  The only reason I don&apos;t give this five stars is that the pole pockets are slightly undersized for proper pole retention, and the design of the pole cross-over ties could be improved for better retention.",

These boots are the hardest to get on and take off even for me when he asks me to help him. They seem tighter around the ankle and they&apos;re the correct size for him. I&apos;m really disappointed as these are his rainy season boots and he will be using them daily. He has to use thin socks, which for rainy, Oregon winters, is not ideal.",

The buckle attachments that secure the brain/top lid both broke due to poor design and had to be secured with a knot. The first one broke at orientation for a Rainier climb, the second side broke during the climb. Additionally, when you use the top lid as a daypack, the attachment for the straps makes absolutely no sense and is poorly designed. Also had to secure these with a knot.",

Probably my only criticism of these pedals is that they tend to have a wide stance feel and that&apos;s okay for downhill riding but when doing trail riding and pedaling it can feel a little bit too wide. I like to have my feet a little closer when pedaling. But for their price they are excellent. I&apos;d say they are more suited to gravity than trail riding.",

Huge platforms (even with my size 13 five tens on them!), good spin, plenty of pins to keep you stuck to the pedals even with my beat up old shoes. \n\nMy only complaint is the two little fixed plastic pins on each side of each pedal: already snapped off a couple of them despite no rock strikes. The metal ones more than make up for it but would be nice to be able to replace all the pins. They seem tough despite being light. \n\nUPDATE: took these down a particularly rocky trail and banged them several times against the rocks: pedals still look basically new. Metal pins are all holding up great, body looks practically unscathed, and I stayed on the pedals.",

        "reviewBody": "I am absolutely in LOVE with this bike! I bought it with the hopes of replacing all of my in town car trips with e-bike trips and so far it has been marvelous. I live downtown in my city and I find it easier and faster than taking a car most places because parking is much easier. I am currently in the process of ordering a lock from the Netherlands that is compatible with the integrated wheel lock for even easier parking. \n\nHow&apos;s the ride? Marvelous! It has a very smooth, natural pedal assist to get you up to speed. It is so much better than some cheaper e-bikes I&apos;ve demo that have a very jerky pedal assist. I couldn&apos;t say for sure if only having pedal assist as opposed to a combo of a throttle/pedal assist is my preference as this is my first e-bike and I certainly don&apos;t mind the light pedal required for the power to kick in. \n\nSecurity: I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s mentioned on the tech specs but the rear wheel has a built in rear lock. You can purchase a compatible chain lock from Axa that plugs in to the integrated lock for added security. I ended up purchasing mine on Amazon UK since they don&apos;t seem to be available in the US at the time of writing this review. \n\n\nSizing: I am 5&apos;6 with a long inseam for my height. I purchased the 53cm size and I have the seat almost as low as it can go and it is a great ride! I do think i could have gotten the 46cm but wanted to be able to share the bike with my partner who is 5&apos;11 and on the end of the size chart for the 53cm.",

The areas that receive the most friction pill first, such as under each sleave and also for some reason the back is also pilling. The quality is very low and it will have to be thrown away soon. I typically usually like Marmot clothing, but items purchased in the past two years have been surprising low quality.",

Bought them right away so\nI have a spare pair when my current ones break - probably several years from now. I’m an old Hippie and they are perfect for my vibe and so comfortable with great support! Was afraid you might be discontinuing this color so when you had a 10 in stock, I jumped at the chance to have a backup pair. I wear them every day - to work at the HBCU where I work in New Orleans and to all the concerts and festivals I attend! Keep them coming in tie dye! Normally a 9 or 9. 5 but a 10 in this shoe for the width. Keep making them in tie dye!!! Thanks a million! Ms. Polly in New Orleans",

Also there is grooving etched into the footbed which is kind of annoying when you are barefoot. These are also wider on the sole, which I noticed as I bike a lot in these and they do not fit the same way as my old Keens do. Likely I will use these for walking and keep my old ones for biking.

It&apos;s great to keep the direct wind off your face and lets your breath keep your face warm, but also doesn&apos;t restrict your breathing, blow your exhaling into your eyes, or accumulate moisture like a tight balaclava. I freakin&apos; love it.",

Thumbholes and baklava/hood are great features and it breathes decently enough (for the heat I used it in). Cannot say how it holds up on a cold day but no complaints so far. I will say it is a little rougher than one would hope for a base layer, I got a little chafing on my chest with it but I wear bibs touring so your mileage may vary. The fabric overall should be softer at this pricepoint imo. At my height/weight it is just on the edge of being too short but still fits fine. Size: M Measurements: 6ft 175",

I used them in all kinds of desert hikes, big mountain summits (Mount Whitney, Grand Teton, Granite Peak in Montana, Gannett Peak, etc,), all hard going and a LOT of pole abuse. My second pair ditto. Then two days ago I came hustling down 2,000 feet from a peak in Oregon, in brush, scree, and snow, and one pole broke internally and came apart. Can you understand my anger when I only got 11 YEARS out of those crappy poles?? [Just kidding, of course. ] I have other Black Diamond poles for snow, etc. , and I don&apos;t look anywhere else for top hiking/climbing gear.",

However, it wouldn&apos;t work by itself for freezing temperatures -- it&apos;s more for cool/cold-but-not-frigid weather. The stair-step stitching is nice and different from a lot of insulated jackets. This is nice to wear just as street outerwear -- I haven&apos;t tried it yet hiking or backpacking, mainly because I like it too much to get it dirty!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this as a midlayer for backcountry skiing or hiking, and an outer layer for mountain running overnight in ultras. It&apos;s just okay. Fundamental problem: the jacket is marketed as having some of the most highly packable insulation. Except it doesn&apos;t have a stuff sack and doesn&apos;t pack into it&apos;s own pocket. Not sure why HH takes pride in packability and then doesn&apos;t offer an option for packing. Second, the jacket is a bit short. It&apos;s fine under a shell, but as an outer layer, it&apos;s over my belly when I lift my hands. I&apos;m 5&apos;5&quot;, so not particularly tall. And third, it&apos;s not that warm - more like a heavy flannel than an insulated jacket. I found it too light to wear on descents skiing. The fabric feels nice, and the interior stuff pockets are nice. But I am now wearing this as a casual wear piece - outer layer if it&apos;s in the upper 40s, or mid layer walking around town in single digits. If you&apos;re looking for something that is warm AND functional for sports, this isn&apos;t it. But if you just want a cute, lightweight jacket, and you aren&apos;t too long-waisted, this is fine.",

The Green Chromapop lens work well in everything from overcast skies to severe clear full sun. Great clarity with enhanced color to boot. Definitely highly recommend these to those looking for an Aviator with a twist. Light weight and very comfortable for extended periods of time.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought my first pair of Serpico&apos;s (1st gen) in 2009 and currently I&apos;m on my fourth pair. My wife liked mine so much that she bought a pair too. The polarized and chroma-pop optical quality is excellentt, the toric lens curvature is beyond reproach, the novel nose-piece design is tops. I think these are the most finely styled aviators on the market. Ever better than my WWII pilot grandfathers mil-issued Ray Bans! \n\nBut, the ear piece, temple piece... hinge interface is poorly designed. Hence why I&apos;m on my fourth pair in 14 years. They eventually wear out or just break, I know this four times first hand. I&apos;ve been round and round with Smith CS many times regarding this and I assure you I take very good care of my glasses. If they aren&apos;t on my face they&apos;re in their case. \n\nSo goodby Smith Serpico&apos;s, I&apos;m done. I&apos;ll dearly miss the Serpico&apos;s but these glasses deserve a redesigned (better) frame that that will hold up better to being worn daily. Spring temples anyone? I&apos;ll keep watch for Serpico III&apos;s. Until then I&apos;m going to try some competitors wares.",

The XL was skin tight.  Looked amazing but no way I could ski without the ability or freedom to layer underneath for cold weather so sized up to 1X.  It’s very loose but don’t mind.  First time as a plus size woman to have a snow pant that doesn’t feel tight and restrictive.  So grateful for the extended sizing in this brand!  I’m usually a 16 or a 14w in clothing in pants.  Gorgeous and unique color!  So noticeable on mountain for my kids to find me.",
