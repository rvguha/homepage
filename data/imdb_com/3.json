I think she is a terrible actress in fact it didn&apos;t even seem like she was acting to me it was pathetic.\n\nTo all of you who watched it just for Paris Hilton and drool over her grow up she is a spoilt slapper who can&apos;t act. Get a grip.\n\nAs for the producers of this film, hat kind of idiots do you take us for. Do better next time or there wont be too many opportunities for you to produce crap movies because people wont watch them.\n\nIf I could mark this film lower I would.",

      "reviewBody": "For the first time, both Mazinger Z and Devilman, two of Gou Nagai&apos;s most famous comic-book creations, explode into the big screen, and the result is a fun, fast-paced, action-packed anime masterpiece!  Similar to GODZILLA VS. MEGALON (my personal favorite Godzilla film, released the same year), it&apos;s got a monster and robot teaming up to beat up other monsters and robots (evil ones, of course)!\n\nWith both characters&apos; shows released the previous year, MAZINGER Z is a classic, while DEVILMAN remains unliked by most of the die-hard fans of the original comic-book, although still mostly appreciated by superhero fans. (In the TV show and this movie, Devilman, like Godzilla, was more slimmed-down and playful than his original scarier comic-book counterpart, but even then, both the 70s Godzilla and animated 70s Devilman were still down n&apos; dirty fighters!)  Nevertheless, this film is a dream-team come true! The animation is colorful and energetic, the voice acting (by the voice casts of both shows) is just as good as fans remember, and the show uses music and songs from both shows (by Michiaki Watanabe and Gou Misawa), with the official introduction of the rocking &quot;Sky-Flying Mazinger Z&quot; song (at the closing credits), sung by Japanese pop king Ichirou Mizuki!  Fans who don&apos;t like repetition should beware that whether it was already done in the MAZINGER Z show or not, this movie again introduces the Jet Scrander (Mazinger Z&apos;s winged jet-pack attachment), as though we&apos;ve never seen it before, so expect fans to say &quot;Aw, man, they&apos;re introducing it for the first time AGAIN?&quot;  Actually, the movies are connected loosely from the shows, but then, the movies are sometimes more fun to watch than the shows (later episodes of MAZINGER Z have recycling &quot;cheat&quot; episodes, much like the later Ralph Bakshi SPIDER-MAN cartoons, which I still like)!  Hell, MAZINGER Z VS. DEVILMAN and the 1974 follow-up MAZINGER Z VS. THE GREAT DARK GENERAL (which introduced Great Mazinger) make great introductions to the genre!\n\nThe plot: At the movie&apos;s opening, our heroic braggart Kouji Kabuto and his girlfriend Sayaka Yumi pilot Mazinger Z and Aphrodite A to beat up two of Doctor Hell&apos;s stock Machine-Beasts, which were about to attack Professor Yumi&apos;s (Sayaka&apos;s father and former assistant to Kouji&apos;s late grandfather, who invented Mazinger Z) lab/headquarters, but suddenly, a giant winged woman creature arrives in a gust of wind and trashes Aphrodite A in no time flat (And remember, that ALWAYS happens in the show!  Poor Aphrodite always kept getting trashed by the Machine-Beast of the week, but after all, I guess that&apos;s because it&apos;s a GIRLY machine!!!).  You guessed it, it&apos;s Devilman&apos;s popular arch-nemesis Silene (only she&apos;s colored blue/purple and her privates are covered with feathers)!  Doctor Hell and his androgynous cohort Baron Ashura take notice, and so does Akira Fudou, who transforms into Devilman (You have to admit, his transformation is really cool: He literally rips out of his entire Akira Fudou guise before growing to giant size!), and eavesdrops on Doctor Hell&apos;s paying a visit to the leader of Devilman&apos;s monster foes, the Demon Clan&apos;s King Zannin (Doctor Hell takes control of the entire clan!).  Akira warns Kouji and his friends about this, but first, by making fun of him and Mazinger Z, leading to a motorcycle race in which Akira insists to Kouji that Mazinger Z MUST have the ability to fly, or he&apos;ll be easily destroyed by his enemies.  Later, Kouji discovers that Professor Yumi and his scientists are constructing a pair of wing attachments for Mazinger Z called the Jet Scrander (yes, again!), but once our fun-loving Doctor Hell gets wind of this, he sends Silene to wreck the Jet Scrander and kidnap Sayaka and Kouji&apos;s kid brother Shirou, who are then rescued by Devilman, who, along with Mazinger Z, have a first encounter with both the Demon-Beasts AND Machine Beasts, courtesy of their respective adversaries!  Our two heroes have decided to join forces to defeat their allied enemies, but can the Jet Scrander be repaired in time while they prepare for the big showdown?\n\nInteresting to note that this film (as well as the other Gou Nagai Super Robot movies) was divided into TV episodes, but blown up into fullscreen from their original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  This movie should be seen in widescreen to be fully appreciated!\n\nIn short, MAZINGER Z VS. DEVILMAN is one of my favorite anime films! Definitely a must-see!",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those rare cases where a terrific movie is equaled by its remake. Hayley Mills carried the dual roles of twins learning of each other&apos;s existence and concocting a plot to reunite their divorced parents splendidly in the &apos;60&apos;s version, and Lindsay Lohan showed wonderful comedic talent at an early age in this delightful remake.\n\nIt&apos;s a Disney flick, so the comedy is family slapstick variety as you would expect. The evil stepmother-to-be is over-the-top evil (even called Cruella De Ville by one of the girls), and she&apos;s a character you love to hate. The obvious chemistry of the parents (Randy Quaid and Natasha Richardson) is great, and begs a question which is never answered to satisfaction, &quot;Why did they split up in the first place?&quot; Everything in the film symbolically shows that they were made for each other: even their respective maid and butler take a shine to each other.\n\nThe fx and editing to stand Lohan&apos;s two characters together is magnificently done; it really looks like two actresses. No split screens, backs of heads of fake-looking &quot;doubles&quot; etc. to distract you from the movie. Lohan skillfully contrasts the American/British accents and mannerisms of the two girls; you know and believe which twin she is at any given moment.\n\nWell directed, well acted and fun. I&apos;ll even forgive the film makers for ripping off the stranded-in-the-lake scene from &quot;Meatballs.&quot; The closing credit snapshots provide a sweet epilogue to tie up loose ends.\n\nGood family oriented comedy worth a rental.",

It&apos;s clear that as an actress she&apos;s most comfortable with musical numbers, where her sparkle really gels. \n\nThe basic problem, as I see it, is with the script. There really isn&apos;t much story; as a result, something has to be added to hold audience interest besides budding super-star Marilyn. Apparently, colorful character was encouraged to pick up the slack. It looks like TCF found their answer in Murray&apos;s ear-splitting version of a Montana cowboy. I guess rural Montana doesn&apos;t have any grade schools where basic civility is taught. No need to belabor his maddening effect since others have made the same point at some length. Nonetheless, Murray&apos;s witless hollering of every line takes down the entire film. Nor does Monroe&apos;s squeaky southern accent that sort of comes and goes help. Nor is the over-extended final scene, where both actors revert to something more normal, enough to compensate for all the gaudiness that&apos;s gone before.\n\nAll in all, the movie&apos;s worth a 3, mainly for its excellent Technicolor staging, Monroe&apos;s singing, and the catchy title tune that was a chart-topper at the time. But beware the movie&apos;s moral, which seems to be a version of &quot;All some people need in order to straighten out is a good beating&quot;!\n\n(In passing—Despite his misfire here, Murray was an excellent actor. Catch his carefully shaded performance in A Hatful of Rain (1957) or in The Bachelor Party (1957) to sample his true potential.)"

      "reviewBody": "A bloody, brutal Western where the action never stops. \n\nFirst, the Bad (let&apos;s get that out of the way). Like all Westerns, the plot has its flaws -- with an Indian war party off the reservation they would not have sent a shipment of ammunition through a narrow canyon guarded by only one squad of green recruits on unbroken/partly saddle broken horses. But so what? In the classic Western Stagecoach the Indians would have shot the horses pulling the stage and then finished off the passengers as opposed to shooting at the people in the coach. Also, Sidney Poitier&apos;s silver vest remains immaculate throughout the long desert journey and several pitched battles.\n\nHowever, the movie moves so fast that you never really have time to stop and remind yourself that you have to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; to watch it.\n\nNext, the Good. On one level, it&apos;s a classic cavalry vs. Indians story. But viewed through a different lens than in earlier Westerns; the Indians are shown with some perspective, if not total sympathy, which probably makes this one of the first Westerns to get beyond a one dimensional view of them. There are a variety of interesting subplots which flesh out the major characters and keep things twisting, turning, and moving along between the combat scenes. In fact, almost every one of the characters is angry about something, creating lots of tension between them. James Garner&apos;s character is looking for the men who raped and killed his (Indian) wife, Dennis Weaver&apos;s Will Grange is angry about almost everything, including that his wife was held captive by the Indians, Sidney Poitier&apos;s Toller (now a civilian) is mad that circumstances forced him to accompany the cavalry on this mission ....\n\nGarner and Poitier give excellent performances and the other actors rise to the occasion, helping us forget that they are, in fact, Scottish or Danish.\n\nAt the end of the movie the various subplots are tied up and the issues are resolved with (in one case) a very surprising twist.\n\nOn top of that, you have a wonderful (almost superb, for this movie) Neal Hefti score, which always seems to correctly reflect the mood of the scene. It fits the movie even better because it makes heavy use of Western/military instruments: guitars, horns, drums, ....\n\nFinally, the Ugly. There are some fairly graphic scenes here (although not exactly like in the Wild Bunch or Saving Private Ryan). The Apaches could torture with the best of them and some of that appears in this movie, although we&apos;re spared the close-ups.\n\nAll in all, I must say that this is one of my long time favorites. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!",

      "reviewBody": "A young musician (Andrea Occhipinti) moves in to a house for the summer, and soon he is surrounded by a series of murders. Evidence trickles in that the killer might be the previous tenant, but nobody knows for sure and some people refuse to talk. And what is in the locked room in the basement? \n\nLamberto Bava came out of his father&apos;s shadow to make &quot;Macabre&quot;, one of the finest Italian horror films of its day. Often overlooked, it is slick and original, and well worth seeking out. He followed it up with &quot;A Blade in the Dark&quot;, co-written by the legendary writer Dardano Sacchetti, which likely gave the film a boost. It, too, has superior picture and sound, far surpassing Fulci&apos;s films of the same era.\n\nBava protests that the film is &quot;not really a horror film&quot;, and some have classified it as a mystery or thriller. This is warranted, but the intense blood, gore and chills make it firmly a horror story in my mind.\n\nLuca Palmerini calls the film &quot;morbid&quot; and &quot;misogynistic&quot; with &quot;claustrophobic overtones&quot;. I may agree on the last part, but the misogyny is a stretch. The women here do take a back seat (and the film does start out by calling Giovanni Frezza&apos;s character a &quot;female&quot; as an insult) but compared to horror as a whole I think it comes across as normal.\n\nThe English dubbing on the Anchor Bay DVD is a bit strange to me, mostly because the characters say &quot;ciao&quot; while otherwise speaking English. Maybe it is just me. But overall, I cannot complain -- a lot of terror comes from a very small blade, and this may be Michele Soavi&apos;s best work as an actor. Coupled with a haunting score, the film is gripping, though the music does tend to get a bit overplayed and old, especially after the first kill.\n\nWhile the film is not as good as &quot;Macabre&quot;, it deserves recognition. Bava threw it together rather quickly with a low budget and unknown actors, with minimal equipment (even the set was actually just the producer&apos;s house). Adapting it from a television script where the goal was to kill someone every thirty minutes, he did pretty well with it. Clearly, he was successful enough that he was able to keep directing and give us the now-classic &quot;Demons&quot;.",

I mean, there are interesting things going on in the sidelines. But Amin himself controlled very carefully everything Schroeder was allowed to see and film. He wanted to come off as a good man and great leader. Mostly he comes off as a babbling fool. If anything can be gleaned from the film, it&apos;s that this guy just wasn&apos;t smart enough to run a country. Like any idiot, Amin let his own bigotry and fear make his decisions for him. Much of the documentary consists of the dictator going on and on about the evils of Israel, and how Uganda will defeat them in an eventual war. There&apos;s a little bit of interest here, but mostly the film is dull. Would have made a nice special feature on the Last King of Scotland DVD, but unfortunately Criterion already has the film available.",

      "reviewBody": "Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: His wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new budding romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he doesn&apos;t know how to start his book, and his students of his screen writing class are stranger than most. However, one student (Danny DeVito) is extra strange. He lives with his evil Momma (Anne Ramsey) and he can&apos;t get up the courage to kill her. So than he goes to Larry for help, making his life go from normal crazy, to extra crazy! \n\nStu Silver should have done more! The dialog, the characters, the whole script is near perfect! And Danny DeVito has proved to me he&apos;s more than a great actor: he&apos;s a great director! His kid&apos;s movie Matilda is among my favorite family movies and now this is one of my favorite comedies.\n\nIt&apos;s a black comedy, most jokes are about murder, but it&apos;s damn funny! All of the actors are doing their full potential, whether they&apos;re main characters (Billy Crystal) or just one-bit minor characters (Olivia Brown).\n\nIf you like comedy (Who doesn&apos;t?) than you&apos;ll like this! 8/10 stars.",

Stars like Flaco Jiminez and Lydia Mendoza appear along with other Tex-Mex musicians. I loaned it to a Mexican/American friend who was in his early sixties and when he returned it he confessed that it made him cry, because it took him back to his childhood as a migrant worker and things he hadn&apos;t thought about for years. To me that is a high recommendation. Even if you don&apos;t like this kind of music you&apos;ll get a kick out of Los Alegres del Teran playing VOLVER without missing a note in a horse corral while riders jostle them.

Eugene Levi and John Candy are appropriately hilarious in supporting turns. 4 stars out of 5."

Some of the guys in Stargate Atlantis also helped, although only Paul McGillion has a major part.\n\nThe film is fun, a bit silly, feeling more like a 3 person play + extras rather than a movie. Its biggest problem is that the script is pretty predictable and the laughs are at the expense of a character who has enough trouble going through life as it is, without people taking advantage of his issues. Any number of things could have gone wrong in real life and that makes suspension of disbelief really difficult while watching. When you laugh, you know you laugh because you are watching a comedy, not because you are &quot;inside&quot;; it would be pretty scary actually feeling inside the script, otherwise.\n\nBottom line: I am not really the comedy type; I&apos;ve watched the movie because of David Hewlett. As such I can&apos;t comment on how funny the film is. Other people might enjoy it more, I found it frustrating, but perhaps because I understood the main character a lot better than the &quot;normals&quot; in the film.",

Rodney Dangerfield, Dana Carvey and a slew of other comedic talent seem like they are paying off a debt to Sandler for even appearing in this movie.  Even poor Kevin Nealon is reduced to wearing boobs on his head and dancing around with tassles twirling around.  It&apos;s despicable.\n\n Sandler plays his normal role of a idiot with a heart of gold, only this time there&apos;s the big twist of him being the son of the devil.  I just didn&apos;t buy it.  I didn&apos;t really buy anything in this movie.  I don&apos;t get it and i don&apos;t want to get it.  If this is what audiences think is funny, then i guess i&apos;m just not &quot;with it&quot;.  And thank God.  If you want to see a thoughtful, CLEVER comedy, go rent &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;.  It is a priceless comedy that will live on, unlike this crap."

They work with frequently returning actors and directors, and there&apos;s always minimally one character - usually a police inspector - providing comic relief. The comedy is presumably inserted because the whodunit stories of Edgar Wallace are convoluted, talkative and often requiring a fairly long time to shift into gear.\n\n&quot;The Black Abbott&quot; is slightly atypical in the plotting department, though, since it&apos;s not a genuine whodunit/mystery. The story revolves around an ancient gold treasure, hidden somewhere in an eerie abbey, and everybody who unravels the mystery of where exactly it&apos;s hidden gets murdered by a killer dressed up as a monk with a black cape. The first hour of the film is overly talkative and confusing, with too many characters to tell apart and the numerous intrigues between them. It&apos;s also doesn&apos;t help that the only two female characters almost look identical. The last half hour contains a lot of action and excitement, though, and the set-pieces are deliciously grim.",

The starting sequence was good with its action but unfortunately that is the best part of the movie. What i liked about the movie was its plot and storyline. Its like Bladerunner meeting resident evil (except with androids instead of zombies). It was interesting even though the ending - the action that triggered it - was weak and derivative. But on the whole the concept was good. What I disliked was the execution. The animation isn&apos;t very good. Yes it looks beautiful except for the characters. The characters basically look like those in-game cut scenes you find in video games. The characters especially their expressions are not well done at all. The hair are blocky solid strands. The characters&apos; facial expression are stony even when it came to cries of anguish...stony expression with mouth open. It may be a small thing to some but for me it takes away from the movie. Entire time I felt like I was watching a video game."

The set-up, the premise, was really kind of complicated and awkward, and that made it hard to get the film off the ground, but this film maker really knows his stuff. He&apos;s an excellent story teller and craftsman.\n\nIt could be said that this movie is just a predictable sentimental movie. But I didn&apos;t find it wholely predictable. The film maker was successful in keeping a substantial amount of mystery and uncertainty wrapped around things. And the story developed so slowly, so gradually, it was wonderful. And poor chubby lost little Senay starts as just a little lost ghost, her face just a blank mask, and as things progress, we get to see more and more into her face and get to see her more as more as a person. It really was quite incredible for me. This movie really took me by surprise.\n\nOne aspect that did seem to be a little overdone was the repeated scenes looking out into the night as Zeki and Senay travel across Europe by car or train. There&apos;s no denying the forlorn coldness and emptiness of looking out the window of a moving vehicle at the electric lights of distant streets and houses, but it just begins to seem a little morbid, a little maudlin, after the 4th such scene.\n\nI really can&apos;t recommend this movie highly enough. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only regret was that I saw it as the first film in a double feature, and the second feature really sucked, so that kind of put a damper on what could have been a very nice evening, a very nice mood. You how it is, right?"

Das Boot is the only submarine movie that shows exactly how it was. It could be a documentary. Bouncing around in the Bay of Biscay with the sea too rough to be able to dive safely and get away from it. &apos;Goffers&apos; pouring down the conning tower and the control room deck ankle deep in the green stuff. Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down. When the sweat starts to dribble upwards you know it&apos;s a cockroach crawling up your body. And that Klaxon. &apos;Hunt for Red October&apos;, &apos;Crimson Tide&apos;. They are just adventure films.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Alan Crosland&apos;s and Warner Bros.&apos; 1927 historic milestone film entitled The Jazz Singer was not the first sound film, nor the first &quot;talkie&quot; film or the first movie musical. It&apos;s completely baffling to hear many people actually associate this film with the visitation of sound, however, if one can recall the 1926 silent film featuring John Barrymore entitled Don Juan, than they would know that it was the first feature film with a Vitaphone soundtrack, though, like The Jazz Singer, it is by no means the first sound film either. The first sound film can be dated as far back to 1895.\n\nThough, not being the first &quot;talkie&quot;, The Jazz Singer, is certainly a remarkable film; it still holds its place as an cinematic landmark for being the first feature-length Hollywood &quot;talke&quot; film in which &quot;spoken dialogue was used as part of the dramatic action.&quot; However, it&apos;s still largely a silent film with a synchronized musical score and a handful of sound sequences built around singing. It&apos;s also become something of a controversial case because of Al Jolson&apos;s (arguably the most popular entertainer of his time) use of blackface in some of the musical sequences, forgetful of the fact that this was a theatrical artifice from the era; it wasn&apos;t intended as &quot;mean-spirited&quot; as so many claim it to be. It was actually praised by black newspapers in 1927, and was being done by another much defamed minority, a Jew.\n\nYou can see what an impact sound must have had in 1927, because it certainly wasn&apos;t the movie that made this production a phenomenon. Though, the film itself, is more than just a movie about a guy who likes music. It&apos;s also a story about a Jewish kid who turns his back on his heritage to try and make it big on the stage - exceptionally daring subject matter for its era, and still enthralling today. It&apos;s certainly not ragged and dull, though, the magic moment when Jolson turns to the camera to announce, &quot;You ain&apos;t heard nothing&apos; yet&quot; - a line so loaded with unconscious irony that it still raises a few goose bumps. Audiences were captivated by this and still are to this very day. A must see!!!",

I had looked forward to seeing it for quite a time, as I had seen it recommended in print a few times. Last Christmas I  missed it, but I caught it this time round (even though - again - it was put on at a very early time by the BBC). Basically it&apos;s a romance -  but one which has a great deal of feeling to it. It&apos;s aesthetic appeal reminds me of Letter From An Unknown Woman. Yet when I viewed that one again recently it disappointed me. This one though had even more of an emotional impact (like when I saw La Strada a few years ago). It isn&apos;t really surrealistic, but it does have a power and is likely to linger in your memory. The ending is actually positive as well. It has a remarkable ability  to make you believe in it, and to therebye become involved."

While the story is a bit clumsy and self-indulgent with so many sidebars that the momentum of the movie gets bogged down in the telling, there are enough fine attributes to make it a recommended evening of reminiscence about Los Angeles, the City of the Angels in the 1930s.\n\nArturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) narrates the tale of a lad from Colorado with one published story in a magazine edited by H.L. Mencken who moves to Los Angeles&apos; Bunker Hill apartments to write his big novel. The city of LA has never seemed so strange as it seems with Caleb Deschanel&apos;s magnificent photography outlining a city filled with dust blown miscreants - people with dreams at varying stages of dissolution. Arturo quickly becomes penniless, is pestered for rent by landlady Mrs. Hargraves (Dame Eileen Atkins) and for handouts by drunkard Hellfrick (Donald Sutherland), and still a virgin he plies his vision as a writer in a local café where he encounters the beautiful Camilla (way too much of a play on the character of Dumas&apos; &apos;Camille&apos;...). The two play a battle of wits and insults to cover their apparent infatuation with each other: Mexican Camilla is looking for a wealthy &apos;white man&apos; to raise her out of her illiterate station and Arturo is looking for a sexual encounter to spur his writing.\n\nDuring their extended &apos;courting&apos; Arturo is vamped by Vera Rivkin (Idina Menzel), a Jewish housekeeper with grossly deformed legs who dreams of a man who will call her beautiful, and in a touching encounter Arturo displays the kind vulnerability lying under his rather callous and naive exterior.\n\nArturo and Camilla at last connect, and in a Laguna beach house they fall under the spell of love, a state that ends tragically, like the dust from the desert winds burying all hopes of the people of Southern California.\n\nThe story is a bit clunky and the dialogue feels forced at times but it is always a pleasure to see the work of Farrell, Hayek, Atkins, and Sutherland. The true beauty of this truly beautiful film is in the atmosphere and the mood captured by Towne and Deschanel. Their work offers a mood piece that forgives some of the awkwardness of the threadbare story and shows off the actors well. The film may move a bit too slowly for some, but for others, this is a moment of history well captured. Grady Harp",

As a result, we were treated to &quot;nice&quot; movies like The One and Cradle to the Grave. This movie though makes up them. This was truly a gem. Not only were the action sequences spectacular, and I iterate spectacular, but the story line and acting as well as screen play was very tastefully done. Gone were the traditional comedic side plot, and welcomed was a sense of respect not only for the Chinese but also for some of the foreign countries that are often portrayed poorly in the movies. In the end, I can&apos;t help but feel like I&apos;ve not only seen a great movie but felt the humanity and pride that the movie released. See it!",

      "reviewBody": "Cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima did a marvellous job, although most of the visuals in this masterpiece are obviously invented by Kobayashi.  It is clearly studio-work, but Kobayashi turns that to his advance by making the most marvellous background paintings I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie and his virtuosity comes to full exposure in the light effects that are fabulous for such an old film.  That together with the beautiful colors creates a mesmerizing and sometimes terrifying experience.  &apos;Marco the magnificent&apos; (Patelliere&amp;Howard, 1964) reminded me of the visuals in Kwaidan, because of the beautiful environmental shots and because of the (supposed) history of mixture of eastern and western stories.  Forget that movie instantly plz. Another film that has nothing to do with this one, but is brilliant and comparable only because of the episode structure, the fairy-tale nature and great cinematography is Kaos (Taviani, 1984).\n\nKwaidan has such a haunting effect because of the scary music and the sound effects are unnerving(-ly edited).  Some call it horror.  I thought the pace was rather slow for horror, but it is a film that does not let go easily. The actors (one of which is Takeshi Shimura) convince enthusiastically and they too make it an entertaining film.  According to the user-rating this is Kobayashi&apos;s least interesting work of these three: Joi-uchi, Seppuku, and Kwaidan.  I can&apos;t wait to see the other two, although I don&apos;t think they can surpass this masterpiece.\n\n10 points out of 10 :-)"

In black and white, everything looked phoney and the storyline seemed tedious. Many years later, I learned some nitwit executive chose to distribute black and white prints. In color the movie is quite entertaining. However, I could have done without the narration, as it gives the movie too much of a 50s feel.\n\nThe worse thing about this entire affair is that this film seems to have ended the career of star William Lundigan. Lundigan had a pretty distinguished early career (I&apos;D CLIMB THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN); however, later, Lundigan seems to have graduated to well-written, but cheaply produced science fiction projects, such as RIDERS TO THE STARS and MEN INTO SPACE.",

      "reviewBody": "When I read the description on the back of the movie, it sounded like I would be watching a WWZ-inspired series of interviews, or a news crew following some military forces. Instead, what I ended up with was a confusing and bland set of boring characters in a frankly underwhelming disaster. The most important things I noticed: 1. The film gives you no reason whatsoever to care about any of the characters. None of them are portrayed as anything other than arguing meatbags. 2. I really have no idea why they make a big deal about these zombies, or why there was an outbreak, since they seem to spend most of the movie standing in one spot waiting for their cue to collapse from a gunshot. 3. The movie didn&apos;t even use blanks for the film. The gunshots were added in after the shooting, leaving you with quite boring gunfire that didn&apos;t even feel like they were killing anything at all. I even heard the pistol sound effect from Killing Floor used for their handgun!\n\nThe movie ends abruptly and with little to no real impact, so I guess it stayed pretty level for the whole film. I wouldn&apos;t have bought it if I knew what it was, and I wouldn&apos;t recommend anything more than a day rent."

      "reviewBody": "The world is coming to an end and does not do so quietly. Amid the chaos, we follow Robinson (Mathieu Amalric) who has just separated from his bourgeois wife Chloé (Karin Viard). While everyone is running, Robinson is searching, desperate to spend another night with the fantasy of his life, the extravagant Laetitia (played by the Dominican model Omahyra Mota). As world, morality and life crumble around him, he lungs himself forward in the unknown to be able to hold her once more.\n\nThis is a very curious film, mixing genres like they do not exist in a permanent flirt with the absurd. Even before entry. Consider the title -Last Days of the World- together with the slogan -Finally free!- and you know that you are in for a controversial ride. But where to? What are we to be freed of? The film definitely takes you places: from a chic Biarritz to a mythical Pamplona and from a refugee-filled Toulouse to the nightlife of Taipei. This is a road-movie in its true sense. You never know where they are taking you and what will happen next and with who.\n\nIn that moral emptiness provoked by the chaos of the end of the world, the characters discover an egoism they never before had the chance to reveal. This egoism leads them to be pulled along by desire rather than boxing it in for a conjugal peace. The pain and disappointment of separation are softened by the sentiment that nothing matters anymore, as suicides and deaths go by as the first passengers to board a flight. But none the less, rating sexual experience or desire as higher than self-preservation or a developed love is strange. Perhaps the idea originally sounded credible that, if the world ends you would pursue your unfulfilled desires. But would you, honestly, not rather be with the people you love? In real life, the answer would be related to how honest your life and love is. But in the film, most of the characters around Robinson seem to have chosen death or are fleeing in a desperate rush of self-preservation, but we are not encouraged to care about them.\n\nIt is Robinson who is our subject of interest. Swimming against the current, near oblivious to the crumbling world around him, he feels free from the conventions which bound him. And then we come to a sublime moment. He is walking with Laetitia, in a deserted post- apocalyptic Paris, when she takes off her clothes. Because she can. He does the same thing and they run through the empty streets happy in their back-to-nature state. And then, for just a few seconds, we see them crossing a busy boulevard with people and cars, as if nothing had changed, as if we are still in the here and now. Was that their imagination of convention shining back at them, or is the whole world-ending actually in his mind?\n\nThe film is filled with symbolic imagery to discover, dreamy eroticism and original locations. It is a mysterious road movie through the absurd which is really best watched late at night, when reasoning powers are looser and the adventure of an unpredictable world can welcome you in. A daring piece of cinema. (incitatus.org)",

The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he&apos;s writing about come to life. Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good. The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is scared of her. It all leads up to a pretty scary ending (although the ending in the story was MUCH worse). The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing the scenery) and a cape that turns people into vampires! There&apos;s also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula.\n\nThis is a good horror anthology--nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills. Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful...and very creepy. It&apos;s well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score too. All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out. Try to see it on DVD--the Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.",

Now a corrupt minister is planning to expel the inhabitants and demolish the buildings so profitable redevelopment can take place. To this end his has a shadowy agency raise tensions and turn public opinions against the inhabitants of the district. They have honest cop Captain Damien Tomaso arrested on a trumped-up charge and murder two other officers before making it look as if they were killed in the District. Unbeknownst to them the killing was filmed; when they realise this the go after the witness but he has passed the recording to Leito. Damien manages to call Leito but before he can do anything he must get away from the security forces. Once reunited Damien and Leito set about exposing the truth and saving the community; to do this they will have to unite the various groups living in the district.\n\nIt must be said the story isn&apos;t that deep and the villains couldn&apos;t be more obviously bad... that doesn&apos;t matter though. The story is just an excuse to give great scenes of parkour and martial arts action... and it really delivers these well. David Belle is amazing in the parkour scenes and Cyril Raffaelli is great in his martial arts scenes; these combine to give the film a feel similar to Hong Kong action films without it feeling as though the makers were copying that formula. The main cast is solid in the &apos;acting&apos; as well as action scenes. The ending is a little disappointing; especially when we only hear distant explosions rather than seeing them... at least they weren&apos;t rendered in poor CGI. Overall this might not be a great film but it is a lot of fun and definitely delivers if you want action and a degree of humour.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",

      "reviewBody": "Kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents&apos; sex lives. And grown-up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido.  Lastly, many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy, frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age.\n\n&quot;The Mother&quot; is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who isn&apos;t ready to stay home, watch &quot;the telly,&quot; and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades, and a controlling, dominating chap at that, packs it in with a massive heart attack.\n\nMay (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in his or her own way.  The male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the Bankruptcy Court with her extravagant commercial venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer.  She&apos;s attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first.\n\nBack at her house after burying her husband, May determines to not stay there.  Rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure, she goes to stay with Paula who has a young son.  Paula&apos;s boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to May&apos;s son&apos;s house.  May is quite taken with hard-drinking, coke-sniffing Darren whose treatment of Paula ought to have alerted May that he was, for sure, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Cads.\n\nWhat follows is a torrid affair between Darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive (dare I say reborn?) widow.  The love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist May&apos;s pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama (or debacle, take your pick).\n\nThe theater in Manhattan was packed for today&apos;s early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of May&apos;s age.  That some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement.  \n\nThis blindingly honest look at an older woman&apos;s awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband&apos;s desire that she stay at home and raise kids (she also mentions he didn&apos;t like her to have friends-what a guy) surfaces a number of issues.  While May&apos;s dalliance with Darren doesn&apos;t constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and issues, with a mother bedding her daughter&apos;s lover.  And Paula isn&apos;t made of the stoutest stuff to begin with.  The affair, once disclosed, allows the peeling open of the mother-daughter relationship which, from Paula&apos;s viewpoint, left something to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother&apos;s support as well as her love-she hasn&apos;t been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn&apos;t a bed of roses either.\n\nMay is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect, indeed demand, a future of happiness.  But she is also inescapably vulnerable. She&apos;s fishing in uncharted emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand, much less resolve.  In her sixties, she&apos;s still a work in progress.\n\n&quot;Something&apos;s Gotta Give&quot; recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited.  After all it&apos;s Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton cavorting in the world of the rich.  And to insure that no serious psycho-social issues were explored, Keaton&apos;s young girlfriend, Amanda Peet, daughter of Keaton, not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er) would-be lover never hopped into the sack.\n\nNo easy out here.  Anne Reid&apos;s inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others.  Her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views).\n\nKudos to director Roger Michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy.\n\n9/10.",

The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.\n\nThe plot had no sense whatsoever. I mean, first they&apos;re on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they&apos;re on a boat. And let&apos;s be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it.\n\nThe only reason for which I gave this a 3, is because it&apos;s still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (haven&apos;t watched the second yet). Just, don&apos;t rent it. I saw it on TV and it&apos;s a good thing I did because I wouldn&apos;t have wanted to waste money renting it."

      "reviewBody": "Ted Post directed and John Milius and Michael Cimino wrote this first sequel to Don Siegel&apos;s classic gritty police drama, Dirty Harry (1971). Magnum Force (1973) is not as near as effective or powerful as the first and original film, but this sequel is watchable and has its merits, too. Harry is now investigating strange killings of criminals, pimps, dirty politicians and others, so the killer is killing &quot;bad guys&quot; this time. Harry starts to investigate the cases, and he has his doubts about all this. Then the truth is revealed and also, unfortunately, spoilt in most of the reviews and comments I&apos;ve read.\n\nHarry has again his usual opponents, mostly his colleagues and superiors who don&apos;t accept his tough style. Harry wants to do justice, but by using his own ways and moral. If talking doesn&apos;t help, then the magnum .44 will. I don&apos;t think this or the first film are fascist, but realistic and honest, and extremely bleak depictions of world and society which is more or less collapsing because of its inhabitants. This film manages still to tell something about that, but the next sequel, The Enforcer, is pretty lame in comparison.\n\nMagnum Force has pretty fat plot and many different characters and sub plots, without being too confusing. Towards the end, the film becomes perhaps too predictable and unbelievable, and I think the ending should have needed little tightening. Now it is little unnecessary shoot outs and nothing else. The film runs two hours, which is the longest running time in the &quot;series&quot;, but still this manages to interest and even surprise, but if they had finished the film some 20 minutest earlier, this would be even more noteworthy film. Now it has nothing too important to offer during its finale, and so the finale becomes little unnecessary, in my opinion.\n\nAs an action film, this is pretty exciting and shot with talent. The action scenes are often fast and full of gunpowder and fire, so director Post can surely direct with skill. The film is pretty brutal and violent at times, and this again shows the fact that films this gritty and violent are not made in Hollywood nowadays, at least not too often. Magnum Force is much more easier and &quot;positive&quot; film than its predecessor, and that&apos;s why it hasn&apos;t got so many things to offer and give. This is pure action film where the first film was also many other things, too, like social commentary and talking about things many would not want to talk about. Magnum Force gets 7/10, but fortunately still has its positive things and even little bit of the power that made Dirty Harry so immortal.",

On the other hand, Fred Bongusto&apos;s music is not bad.",

No. Japanese unit 731 under Ishii Shirō guidance made terrible experiments on live people too, including pregnant women and children.

      "reviewBody": "The funniest thing about &apos;Rackety Rax&apos; is its title, which is a very clever pun. &apos;Rackety rax!&apos; is the first line of a college football cheer that was popular in the 1920s and thirties: in this movie, that same phrase does double duty as a college cheer and as a pun on &apos;rackets&apos; as in racketeers. I&apos;ve always believed that most American colleges exist only as pretexts for a football team or basketball team ... and that college sports exist primarily as a vehicle for universities (and bookies) to make money. This movie does nothing to dispel that notion.\n\nVictor McLaglen (betraying some trouble with his accent) plays hulking gangster Knucks McGloin (great name!), who founds a school called Canarsie College. (Canarsie being a neighbourhood in New York City that produced more than its share of gangsters.) Knucks doesn&apos;t really care about higher education: Canarsie College was created only so that Knucks would be able to control a collegiate football team, which in turn would be a vehicle for his gambling activities. By organising the bookie action on Canarsie&apos;s football matches, Knucks makes enough money to offset the expense of the college.\n\nKnucks&apos;s highly profitable operation attracts the attention of Gilotti, a rival gangster ... played by Stanley Fields, a coarse supporting actor of the 1930s who is undeservedly forgotten by film buffs. Gilotti sets up his own rival college, with a rival football team, and the shenanigans begin.\n\nAlan Dinehart, another undeservedly forgotten supporting actor, is very funny as McLaglen&apos;s lawyer, and hulking actor Ivan Linow is good as a dim-witted athlete named Tossilitis (hilarious name!). Interestingly, McLaglen and Linow each played Hercules the strong man in the two film versions of &apos;The Unholy Three&apos;. Good support here from Allen Jenkins, Vince Barnett, and Esther Howard in a rare comic role: she usually got cast in bland &apos;stick&apos; parts.\n\nI&apos;ll rate &apos;Rackety Rax&apos; 5 out of 10. It&apos;s funny, but -- considering the potential of this material -- it could have been downright hilarious.",

      "reviewBody": "For a movie made in 1946 this production carried a tricky subject matter. Moral restrictions forbid people to have sexual relationships before marriage, and if they had, the demand was that it bore no consequences. Ole Palsbo has a clear element of social responsibility underlining his career as a film director, so focusing his attention on one of the many secret places in the province providing shelter for becoming young mothers was just up his alley. The subject matter is treated with responsibility and taste and having a prolific comedy actor as Ib Schønberg with a vast list of titles already on his CV playing the father of the house rendering his role with a certain kind of humor and good common sense, this is just what the poor young girls need in a situation like theirs. Palsbo could present a character with only a few lines of dialog, and the staging is precise and to the point all through. He died far too early in 1952 and you can only imagine the number of quality films he could have directed if he had been allowed to continue his craft for some more years.",

Unfortunately I prefer the more grounded Fellini, therefore this is not a compliment, actually I didn&apos;t particularly enjoy the movie. It was disjointed enough to compromise my interest and in the long run I got bored.\n\nThe only things I was able to salvage from the film are the creativity of the director and some thinking about how we treat the elderly of many freedoms for our own ease.",

One day, Charlie drops off some drums at a remote area where he meets some Inuit Eskimoes who give him a pair of valuable ivory tusks as trade in order to have him take back a young woman to a hospital, as she is coughing up blood and may have tuberculosis. He reluctantly agrees, and while on the journey, the plane breaks down and they crash land in the middle of nowhere. He jumps up and down, cursing their dilemma, while the Eskimo girl calmly uses a piece of string to catch fish. Her outdoor skills are formidable, and he soon realizes that she is much better then he is in the great outdoors. They walk a long way and eventually he decides it would be better to return to the plane to await a rescue. They set up camp and most of the film shows the two learning to communicate and teaching each other their very uncommon cultures. The scenery is beautiful, and the young actress a natural, which makes The Snow Walker a trip worth taking.",

      "reviewBody": "Loli, played by Victoria Abril, has given up a promising career as a dancer to  become the wife of a womanising estate agent; and though she knows of one woman he has had an affair with and has forgiven him, she knows nothing about any of the others - not even her own baby-sitter! No. Her main complaint against him is not his promiscuity but that he takes her for granted and shows her little affection. So, when a butch lesbian, played by Josiane Balasko, appears on the scene, stopping at the house to ask for water for her van&apos;s radiator, she is a ripe fruit waiting to be picked. And this kind, mature, worldly-wise lesbian is an expert in the art of seduction.\n\nOn an evening out together, the husband, played  by Alain Chabat, already annoyed at the lesbian&apos;s intrusion into his home with his wife&apos;s encouragement, is driven into a blind fury when he discovers the lesbian&apos;s hand half way up his wife&apos;s thigh and sees them dancing together in a way that is very intimate. From this follow many scenes of shouting and screaming, jealousy and rage. You feel for the husband&apos;s usurpation and his humiliation at being rejected for a lesbian - though you rejoice at his come-uppance - and you feel for the wife who deserves the affection she has been so long denied, and you feel for the lesbian with a loving heart who wants only to make the wife happy - though others may condemn her for destroying a relatively happy marriage. The husband hates her so much and is so desperate to get rid of her that he is willing to do anything to get her to leave.\n\nBut despite all the passion and jealousy this is a light comedy and not a heavy drama, and you have the feeling all along that everything will work out well in the end. And it does. The moral of the story, affirmed at the end, is that the only things that matter are love, tenderness and affection and if we get those the source&apos;s sexual gender is immaterial; we are all bisexual.\n\nThis is a bright, witty and observant comedy, well-acted, particularly by Victoria Abril,"

I actually went there for my freshmen year, then they shut the school down for construction for two years and moved us to the new school, then we got to come back to the original &quot;PV&quot; for our senior year. So apparently they shot this movie while we were at the other school. Why the hell didn&apos;t I ever hear about this??? You would&apos;ve thought everyone who lives near there would&apos;ve been talking about this. Oh wait I know why....cuz it&apos;s a low budget straight-to-video B movie! LOL!!!

      "name": "Not too bad, not too good, and it&apos;s definitely Betty Hutton&apos;s movie",
      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s Dance is a Betty Hutton movie. Fred Astaire may have equal billing, but Hutton dominates the picture. Her mixture of tomboy boisterousness and unrelenting brashness makes the casual and easy-going Astaire seem as relevant as Percy Kilbride trying to catch up with Marjorie Main. During the Forties, audiences loved Betty Hutton. She was hugely insecure, which probably accounted for her need to give 150 per cent, when 90 per cent would have served her better. \n\nWith Let&apos;s Dance, It&apos;s almost startling to see how Fred Astaire has difficulty establishing his presence against Hutton&apos;s unremitting energy. It doesn&apos;t help that the songs, written by Frank Loesser, are tailored more to Hutton&apos;s strengths than they are to Astaire&apos;s. None of the songs are noteworthy, and they often blend heavy rhythmic repetition, loudness and jitterbug style with ample opportunity for Hutton to mug and exaggerate. Even the one romantic song, &quot;Why Fight the Feeling,&quot; is given to Hutton first to deliver as a comic vamp. Loesser had written for Hutton before and he knew her strengths. \n\nThe story is about Kitty McNeil (Betty Hutton), an entertainer for the troops, who marries a rich, socialite Army pilot in London in 1945. He dies shortly after, shot down, but not before Leaving Kitty with child. Fast forward five years later when Kitty and her son are living with the boy&apos;s very rich great grandmother. The woman, snobbish and high in society, believes Kitty is unsuitable as a mother to the boy. But Kitty escapes the mansion with her son and, after a few tribulations, gets a job as a cigarette girl in a nightclub. But guess what? Her partner during the war years had been Don Elwood (Fred Astaire). They had sort of loved each other. They met by accident in a cheap diner after Kitty had kidnapped her son. It was Don who helped her get the job in the nightclub where Don did some dancing while he tried to establish himself as a financial whiz. The story goes on and on. For Kitty, she must fight off her son&apos;s great grandmother and the woman&apos;s lawyers. She has Don to help her. Of course, all the people in the nightclub, from the owner to the cooks to the dancers, fall for the little boy and try to help Kitty, too. All the while she and Don are edgily moving closer...a kind of boy and girl love each other, boy loses girl, then repeat three times. Finally, boy gets girl along with a five-year-old stepson. \n\nBut this is an Astaire movie, sort of, so what of the singing and dancing? &quot;I Can&apos;t Stop Talking About Him&quot; is the opening number, sung and danced before the troops in 1945 by Kitty and Don. Kitty is in a bright pink dress, Don in drab Army brown. Your eyes tend to focus on Hutton and the dress. Hutton sings the song and she and Astaire dance. It&apos;s all in the Hutton style, loud. Astaire dances a rehearsal number with two pianos, clambering over and under them and playing some piano himself. &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; is a hip version of the old fairy tale which Astaire sings to Kitty&apos;s little boy. It&apos;s not that bad, and Astaire gets to make a long bean stalk out of a newspaper while singing it, but it&apos;s little more than specialty material. &quot;Oh, Them Dudes&quot; is a raucous cowboy song and dance with Hutton and Astaire gussied up like old-time mustachioed cowboys. Astaire did this kind of thing better with Judy Garland in Easter Parade&apos;s &quot;Couple of Swells&quot; and would do it better again with Jane Powell in Royal Wedding&apos;s &quot;How Could You Believe Me....&quot; &quot;Why Fight the Feeling,&quot; Astaire has said, was a song he liked a lot. In Let&apos;s Dance, it just doesn&apos;t get a chance to establish itself. The movie&apos;s finale, &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; is another loud production number tailored much more to Hutton than Astaire. They sing and they dance, but Hutton is mugging all the way. \n\nLet&apos;s Dance features some pleasant comic turns by Roland Young and Melville Cooper, as well as solid character actors such as Ruth Warrick, Shepperd Strudwick, Barton MacLane and George Zucco.",

I can&apos;t believe that the store would have the utter gall and contempt for its customers to place Little Bigfoot in the bargain DVD bin. From the initial shot of the sneering, eye-patch-wearing logger to the subtle POV shot of sawdust from a logger&apos;s chainsaw falling on the camera lens, the director unflinchingly inserts every known movie cliché, only to skewer it in the next utterly unique shot. Our group of reviewers discussed the merits of the film well into the night; I have not had such an enjoyable movie experience since MST3K was canceled.\n\nIt is incomprehensible that a work of this magnitude should be followed by a sequel, but indeed Little Bigfoot II was released mere months later. Apparently the power of this one-two combination was too much for the producers, as we have not been treated to a third blockbuster installment.",

The first time I ever saw this movie on television was way back when I was a teenager and I was babysitting. It&apos;s one of those movies where each time I watch it I see things I missed before; either in someone&apos;s performance or in the way a scene is filmed or something else. Fredric March is just flawless as a self-made businessman and widower in his fifties and Kim Novak is edgy as the beautiful but damaged and insecure young woman working at his company. Everyone calls her somnambulistic, but in this movie I could feel her nerves jump right through her skin at times. I thought she was very good in the role. I have to mention that one of my favorite characters in it is the son-in-law, Jack, played by Martin Balsam--a fantastic actor, of course, but he is so great in this, that, although he&apos;s not in many scenes--he just knocks me over every time I watch it. The characters all sound so true to life, of course, because they were written by Paddy Chayefsky. I found the subject matter fascinating and believable and although the standout performance was definitely that of Fredric March, playing all facets of a mature man, all actors involved were right on the mark. When WILL they make this movie available on VHS or DVD? My home-made tape looks crummy, I admit it! (And the movie is hardly ever shown on television any more) Anyway, this is one of my favorite 100 films.",

Gargoyles are still roaming around the world and people are also still living in secret bases. David along with his dog Butch is out collecting raw materials so they can create a vaccination to battle the germ that has been accidentally let loose on the human race. David is colder and more desperate this time around. This time around I found it was PREDATOR that was being ripped off, but not to the degree ALIEN was in the original.\n\nIn addition it seems this sequel gets a lot of criticism as being a bad film, but personally I didn&apos;t find it any worse than the original. In fact I found it more original with its story. The music by. Terry Plumeri was good even though at times it seemed quite similar to Alan Silverstri&apos;s score to PREDATOR. If you really liked the original give this one a try if you want. If you didn&apos;t like the original I would just say skip this one. Also starring Andrew&apos;s mother Stella Stevens, R. Lee Ermey and Renee Jones. Executive producer was the king of B movies Roger Corman.",

      "reviewBody": "In six words: great idea-not so great execution. In a slightly vague future, Robin Williams plays a video editor named Alan, his job is assembling 1-2 hour video portraits of deceased clients whose parent&apos;s were well off enough to have had them fitted (while still in the womb) with a &quot;Zoe&quot; implant. Named after the corporation that initially developed this device, the implant records (24-7) everything that happens to a person during their lifetime. It is important to the story that viewers understand that these are not memories but actual recordings. This distinction is critical to the plot as well as to one of the interesting questions posed by the film; to what extent have our actual memories been distorted by time. \n\nThe editors (called cutters) must distill down this lifetime of footage into a brief highlights video, discretely deleting scenes that would be offensive to the family of the decreased. This is not that different than the writers of obituary notices (see &quot;Closer&quot;). The video is shown at a special memorial service called a &quot;rememory&quot;. To add some unnecessary complexity to the story there is a violent protest group who object to the whole concept. The basis of their objection is never adequately explained but seems to be centered on the fact that the footage is by necessity all from the person&apos;s own &quot;point-of-view&quot;, with the protesters chanting &quot;remember for yourself&quot;. \n\nOf course a Cutter sees everything (mostly in fast motion) making him or her privy to a person&apos;s every secret and sin. In the film they briefly raise the most interesting question posed by this whole idea, if you knew that someone (be it man or God) would replay your entire life, to what extent would it change your behavior? In the film most (but not all) people with the implant are aware that they have it. \n\nKnowing all this stuff makes Alan a lonely man. His philosophy: &quot;The dead mean nothing to me, I took this job out of respect for the living&quot;, has caused him to avoid close interpersonal relationships, which might compromise the many confidences he is keeping. Within the closed community of cutters he is known as a &quot;Sin Eater&quot; because of his willingness to sanitize the lives of the scum of the earth, accepting clients that the other cutters reject. Williams looks even sadder and more depressed than in did in &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;. It is a extremely restrained performance, not especially challenging but perfectly suited to the mood of this film. \n\nAlan gets in trouble when he takes on a project for a rich widow (Stephanie Romanov). Her husband knew a lot of corporate secrets and had been playing around with their young daughter. This &quot;messing around with something much bigger&quot; has a Raymond Chandler feel to it, and this fits nicely with what might be called a futuristic film noir production design. \n\nOverall the many interesting ethical and philosophical questions raised by &quot;The Final Cut&quot; are more interesting than the film itself. In fact, there is so little real suspense and character identification that the viewing process is mostly an exercise in pulling yourself back from your contemplation of earlier scenes so that you can follow what is happening on the screen. \n\nThe film goes wrong by introducing a parallel story about Alan&apos;s childhood. While well handled, it fails in its purpose of explaining his adult motivations. By the end we care nothing about his character or his actions and are back to day dreaming about the many issues the film raises but does not adequately address. \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

The awkwardness of the set-up is almost completely outweighed by the believability and lovability of most of the characters. I&apos;m generally of the opinion that Robert Mitchum can do no wrong, but I was unprepared for the calm and masculine sweetness of his performance in a role that might normally have gone to Robert Young or Robert Cummings. Jean Simmons is much more interesting in roles where she can smolder a little, but she&apos;s almost adorable here. And the supporting cast, especially Arthur Hunnicutt, is both true to small-town life and quite excellent at depicting well-drawn and individual characters. And my goodness, whatever happened to Eleanor Todd, the cutie who yearns for Mitchum&apos;s affections? She apparently appeared in one other film, also with Mitchum. She&apos;s really attractive and interesting in what might otherwise have been a cardboard role. Nice little surprise, this picture.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a lot of fun. Judi Dench is great to watch as a brash, rich, sometimes naive woman who buys a theater as a hobby after her husband&apos;s death. She adds fire and life to every scene she&apos;s in and has a superb on screen rapport with Bob Hoskins.\n\nThe nudity is handled very well. The audience was completely silent when the girls first appeared in all their God-given glory. I think that no one wanted to be heard reacting in any way. But after a while the nudity in the film became as secondary to the story as it did to the audience. There are characters and their relationships that you care about and then WWII starts up with all of Hitler&apos;s insanity. They become the real focal points.\n\nIf you go to the movie knowing what you&apos;re in for, you&apos;ll have a wonderful time. It is well-done and has a good story with terrific actors. There are some lines that are very, very funny. Audience members of all ages were clapping when it was finished and you will too.",

The only witness to the crime was 10-year-old Billy, who the gang tries to snuff out while Cotton and Decker try to figure out who is the Kingpin behind all of this. \n\nJerry Cotton was a American FBI crime fighter exclusive to Germany (?) in books starting in the 1950s and this is the second of 8 Cotton films made by the West Germans between 1965-69. The first four are in black and white and the last four are in color. The films are breezy affairs and Nader is fun as the Bondsian hero. The investigation is fairly routine in this one (you&apos;ll laugh at the main villain reveal and their motive) but it is fun to see the 60s decor and styles. Also, the filmmakers try to pass of Germany for NYC (not gonna happen). There is some location work of Jerry&apos;s trademark jaguar driving around and lots of stock footage of the city. They also try to create a massive FBI office-scape by having actors stand in front of rear projections of file footage. The film&apos;s action highlight is at a coal processing plant.",

Then again, it&apos;s better than most of the &apos;Star Wars&apos; prequels&apos; performances and you sat through those too, didn&apos;t you?\n\nHowever, this should not deter you from watching the movie. If, like me, your attention was peaked by the 80&apos;s throwback poster, you know what you like in this type of movie. \n\nThe story, derivative as it is (think Body Snatchers), serves as a vehicle for a slasher-like succession of grisly, well-shot murders. In a sparse visual style, maybe even a little bleak due to the setting, we see the events unfold methodically and with increasing intensity to the suspenseful finale.\n\nIn a mere 80 minutes, &apos;Almost Human&apos; shows what a gifted director can do: very much with very little. You will not be surprised, but you will be entertained.\n\nP.S.: To the guy who kept hearing crickets during the second half of the movie: you might wanna get your ears checked.

The movie contains problems from usual life, depression and other facts that everyone has got a contact with it in their life. Préparez vos mouchoirs is the movie for people with open mind and different view for the life and surrounding problems during our life. Maybe it has got a clue for that kind of problems?

      "reviewBody": "A &quot;tough, old bird&quot; may not be an apt enough description of George Zucco&apos;s high priest character in the Mummy series. Somehow, still alive and shaking, he passes on the priesthood of what is now referred to as &quot;Arkham&quot; to Yousef Bey (John Carradine) &amp; once again feels the need to recap the mummy&apos;s life history, which has been altered since &quot;Mummy&apos;s Tomb&quot;. Now the story goes that the once exalted Princess Ananka died an accursed death and that Kharis was buried with her. Now it&apos;s the task of Yousef to go to Mapleton and bring the royal dead of Egypt back to their homeland.\n\nMeanwhile, the wafting scent of tana leaves in the air attracts Kharis to the home of one Professor Norman. As Kharis shambles his way towards the cup of life, a young dish named Amina Mansouri (Ramsay Ames) gets a chance to show off her talents in filling out a nightgown as she sleepwalks her way to the very same house. Anyone else notice that black cat that ran in front of Ames during this scene? I believe that&apos;s called foreshadowing.\n\nThe reincarnation angle from the original Karloff &quot;Mummy&quot; gets dusted off. The spirit of Ananka has left its mummified shell &amp; taken residence in the body of Amina. Now Kharis must go about what must be for him a pleasant task of carrying off yet another woman clad in white (it&apos;s the only activity that gets his &quot;dead&quot; arm to work) and hope that another high priest won&apos;t succumb to any lascivious thoughts lurking in the back of his mind.\n\nBut, that&apos;s not how things work out, for the life of an undead character stuck in repetitious sequels penned by unimaginative story writers is a hard one. The only merciful thing to do would&apos;ve been to let Kharis &amp; his Princess drown in eternal bliss, but the call of the box-office demanded one more sequel (Amon-Ra help us).",

      "reviewBody": "This is a co-production Spanish-Italian-German with a varied cast formed by actors of diverse countries . The classic James Fenimore Cooper&apos;s novel is brought to screen is this Western adventure and in Spaghetti style . The picture takes several liberties and is partially inspired on the known novel . There happens Indian wars between Hurons , Mohawk , settlers and army , while the tribes allied fight to each side . The story is about a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left , Uncas (Daniel Martin) and Chingachgook as well as one adopted white man named Hawkeye (Anthony Steffen) . But the father Chingachgook is killed by the Magua&apos;s hoodlums . On their way they intercept Indians led by Magua attacking a small regiment in command of captain Bill Hayward (Joachim Fuchsberger) including the two daughters (Karin Dor as Cora and Marie-France as Alice) of Colonel Munroe (Carl Lange) on their way to a fort . The three men lead the survivors to the fort while love stories take place but the War continues . Meantime , the fort is besieged by the Indians allied a group of bandits who want to take a hidden gold . Later on , there takes place an impressive explosion that buries partially the fort . Later that , at the end occurs a violent fighting between Unkas and Magua by saving the life of Cora . \n\nThis is an exciting film , plenty action , thrills , fights , love and breathtaking outdoors from Almeria . Acceptable action sequences with rousing attacks and spectacularly realistic battles . Charismatic performance for all casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , Anthony Steffen is good as Hawkeye . Anthony Steffen may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados, but in his day, from the mid-&apos;60s to the early &apos;70s, Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics. The handsome, Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz de Teffè von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there, Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre , where he found his niche . Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood, however, Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction . Special mention for Karin Dor , director&apos;s wife , she is wonderful and Daniel Martin as honorable Unkas and Ricardo Rodriguez as Magua as an appropriately villainous in a powerful performance . Look for secondary actors usual of Spaghetti Western as Frank Braña , Rafael Hernandez and Chris Huerta , among others . Colorful cinematography by Francisco Marin reflecting splendidly the sunny exteriors from the haunted city of Cuenca and Almeria where in the 60s and 70s were shot hundreds of Spaghetti Westerns . The motion picture was regularly directed by Harald Reinl who directed in similar style various episodes of ¨Winnitou and Surehand¨ based on Karl May novels . Other versions about this classic story ¨The last Mohican¨ are the followings : 1922 , mute adaptation by Maurice Tourneur and Clarence Brown with Wallace Beery as Magua ; the classic 1936 by George B Seitz with Randolph Scott as Hawkeye ; 1985 TV movie by James L Conway with Steve Forrest and Ned Romero . Of course , the best rendition was directed by Michael Mann (1992) with Daniel Day Lewis , Madeleine Stowe , Jodhi May and Wes Studi as Maua .",

This one got skipped.\n\nComparisons to Last House.. will crop up but apart from murderers taking asylum in an isolated house, this one is different but a bit boring inspite of being a relatively short film.\n\nOne of the best part is the cinematography, the rural isolation with the creepy farmhouse is well captured.\n\nThey shud have shown some background story about Lisa&apos;s psychology.\n\nCan someone tell me who was the man trying to enter Lisa&apos;s farm but got chased away by the two murderers during the meal around 31st min.\n\nDid Lisa informed the cops during their first visit or later after the two murders.\n\nWhy did the third bearded trespasser ran out after seeing the dead body in the chimney?",

      "reviewBody": "The remarks of the detractor in this array of reviews is confusing and confused.  Look.  I read Maugham&apos;s book in the late 40s and saw the Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, Clifton Webb film.  So what?  This film was neither one but that&apos;s beauty of art, dudes.  It doesn&apos;t have to.  The Razor&apos;s Edge is an odyssey of a man in search of himself.  The transit nature of life and the brutality of war turn him into a &quot;superfluous&quot; man, who goes off on a quest to find himself.  We can inundate this issue with metaphors until the cows come home, but that&apos;s Maugham&apos;s story.  Old Somerset, a closet homosexual who was a volunteer in the horrorific WW1 went through a similar transformation and in a way, this novel, which he began back in the 20s, reflects that journey.  Murray takes the character of Larry Darrell into a new domain.  Why shouldn&apos;t he?  He&apos;s not Tyrone Power.  He&apos;s a comedian who plays a tragic role straight.  There is much in this film that makes it superior to the 40s version.  A stronger statement of the tragedy of the entanglement of the two women and a more intense presentation of the character of Larry. I saw this film when it first aired and recalled a young high school kid remarking to a friend upon exiting, &quot;Man, this is a totally awesome movie.&quot;  I agree.  Alas, the critics and comedy-addicted Murray fa ns didn&apos;t and it flopped.  Pity.  It is a totally awesome movie.",

Without &quot;spoilers&quot;, but the last 40 minutes can perfectly cause vomiting, disgust and discomfort in viewers who have some sensitivity. Unfortunately, that is not enough to say that it is &quot;a good movie&quot;, because it&apos;s not. The greatest merit of its creators is to have done, literally, what they felt like. However, that freedom has become tedious, in scenes two or three times longer than it should (attention to that prologue of the TV, in the Christmas Eve program), and for that reason, the movie lasts almost 2 hours. That is too much. A film with an interesting plot, in many moments really sick, but that does not become what it should be. A pity",

      "reviewBody": "In the normal scheme of things, lofty MGM wouldn&apos;t have touched John O&apos;Hara&apos;s novel with a ten foot pole--but shortly before her contract was to end, MGM star Elizabeth Taylor besmirched her image by running off with Debbie Reynolds&apos; husband Eddie Fisher. With her reputation in shreds and one foot outside the studio gate any way, MGM decided to capitalize on the bad press by casting Taylor as BUTTERFIELD 8&apos;s bad-girl-from-hell... and then, to add insult to injury, tucked Eddie Fisher into a supporting role and cast Debbie Reynolds look-alike Susan Oliver in the role of Eddie&apos;s girl friend, who feels threatened by Liz&apos;s manhungry ways. Liz fought the project tooth and nail, but MGM was adamant: she owed them another film, and she wasn&apos;t leaving until she made it.\n\nBUTTERFIELD 8 is the story of Gloria Wandrous (Taylor), a hard-drinking, sexed-up, bed-hopping dress model who gets her kicks by seducing and then dumping men according to whim--until she encounters an unhappily married man just as hard and disillusioned as she in Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey.) Although the production code was still somewhat in force, it had loosened up quite a bit since the days of NATIONAL VELVET, and while scenes stop short at the bedroom door they have plenty of sizzle while they walk up to it; moreover, every one in the film talks about sex so much you&apos;d think it had just been invented. Taylor is on record saying that she considers the film a piece of trash, and she swears she has never actually seen it, that she would rather die than ever see it.\n\nBut something weird happened as the camera rolled. Taylor, doubtlessly driven by her fury at having to do the movie, gives a throw-away, over-the-top performance--but perversely, this is precisely what the role requires, and her performance was successful enough to earn her an Oscar. The supporting cast follows her lead, all of them performing in broad colors and bigger-than-life emotions, and again they too are quite successful, with Laurence Harvey and Dina Merrill (as his long suffering wife) particularly effective. Ultimately, of course, Elizabeth Taylor is quite right when she says the film is a piece of trash. But it is the best kind of trash because it is so completely trashy: BUTTERFIELD 8 doesn&apos;t just dive into the trash pile, it wallows in it with considerable conviction. Modern films of the same type may show more skin and more sex, but for sheer authority BUTTERFIELD 8 remains a standard against which most of them pale. Not every one will like it, but I recommend it all the same.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

      "name": "A very dull and boring movie - what&apos;s the hype?",
      "reviewBody": "There was a &quot;genre&quot; of Hungarian films in the 1980s sarcastically referred to as &quot;movies for everyone, without anyone watching them&quot; (in Hungarian: &quot;közönségfilm, közönség nélkül&quot;). These were dull, &quot;artistic&quot;, boring movies which attempted to grasp big questions of life, but utterly failing. Snobs always cheered these movies as being &quot;avantgarde&quot;, but a matter of fact they are just as novel as coffee with salt. Miklós Jancsó, Béla Tarr and most hyped Hungarian directors all fall in this category. Seriously nobody in Hungary can wrap their minds around the hype around these people. There were many such movies produced in those years, resulting in most people avoiding Hungarian movies in general. As a counterbalance, they started adding as many nudity as possible. (Porn was banned in those times, this was the only way to see pictures of naked women.) The term &quot;art film&quot; still counts somewhat a slur in Hungary today. This one is exactly that kind of movie.\n\nFor today&apos;s viewers, even young Hungarians, it might hold a touch of retro, an insight to Communist Hungary and miserable life in those times. That&apos;s in fact cattle manure. Hungary was never like this. Why is it that every movie about life in Budapest just has to be shot in the run-down slums of the 8th district? Why the characters should always be desperate, broken existences with acute alcoholism and smelly armpits? But that wouldn&apos;t be a problem if the movie would actually tell some STORY. But there is absolutely NOTHING. You just wait and wait, for one and a half hour, for something to happen. Nothing does though. Yup, the film starts OK, the main characters are introduced, and there is a conflict. That&apos;s about the first three minutes. And then? Nothing then. No tension, no excitement, no nothing. Just a bunch of authentically depicted, but meaningless characters, no development, no plot twists, only an inevitable ending. Plus some sad nostalgic songs and a lot of alcohol.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Communist Hungary I can assure you, not everybody lived like this. Yes, there were such people, but why on earth would we look at their lives? They are still around, the 8th district is still the same heap of ruins, and we don&apos;t go there to look at them. Except police officers.\n\nIf you want to see a worthy movie about the very same milieu and credible acting, watch &quot;Wreck Movie&quot;, which was made about decade later. In fact it features some of the same actors and actually the same location - no kidding, the very same house, and the pub frequently mentioned in this movie, named &apos;Stork&apos; (Gólya), which is just two doors down the street. Nowadays it&apos;s a famed hipster pub, with the same name.\n\nThis movie is only for true art snobs who despise entertaining value and are willing to consume pictures that actually carry no meaning at all, just to have something to discuss in the cafe the next day. I&apos;d have given it one star only if Károly Eperjes&apos; acting talent hadn&apos;t saved the day.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;El Lobo&quot; tells the real story of a government agent that during the 70s (during the time when Franco is dying and a time of change is coming in Spain) infiltrates the ETA (a separatist terrorist organization). It&apos;s a very dangerous mission and this film succeeds in portraying the tension and perplexity of the agent (codename Lobo - wolf in English) and the doubts that the new times to come arouse inside the ETA and in Spain.\n\nThis is a fast-paced thriller that unlike its American counterparts doesn&apos;t tell us who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. We see the idealism in ETA militants that lead them to indiscriminate killing and the opportunism of the government circles. Instead of giving us a ready-made solution the film poses questions that linger in our mind. For instance: with the coming of democracy wouldn&apos;t it be better to give up armed struggle and become an organized party? This generates conflicts inside ETAs leading circles and the agent Lobo is inside this turmoil.\n\nToday with the crescent European integration these questions are still valid. Is it necessary to fight for old ideals that have lost its reason of being or wouldn&apos;t it be better to adapt to the new times where integration is the password? In a few sketches, the agent Lobo, the ETA militants, the government officials, the mood in Spain, are drawn in a realistic way and give us a feeling of real persons and events.\n\nRent this film. &quot;El Lobo&quot; is very intense and sometimes desperate (like the 70s in Spain). New times are coming. What shall we do? What will happen?",

The story was unbelievable but for those of us who never saw a believable story out of Hollywood it was just as real as a Gene Autry western. We enjoyed all genres and that meant Gene Autry and Dorothy Lamour equally. There were Frank Buck documentaries (so-called) that were hokier than anything the B movies presented and those too were very popular. Perhaps we should only judge those pictures in the context of the times they were presented. I would love to see The Jungle Princess again and revel in Ray Milland&apos;s revelation on the Johnny Carson show what he did in a swimming scene with Dorothy."

Started in the business playing the mighty Wurlitzer theater organ. RIP. Great guy. Great teacher.\n\nFirst met John in 1976 where he was teaching at a St Paul Minnesota film school called &quot;Film in the Cities.&quot; He was my first introduction to the concept of documentary film and its ethics and purpose, even though he openly admitted that as a newsreel &quot;journalist&quot; in the 30&apos;s or whatnot, his own start was far less than ethical. But that taught me about even modern &quot;fake news&quot; and instilled a healthy cynicism toward those, like Michael Moore, who, however much you may believe in his point of view, is in fact propagandizing a point of view.\n\nJohn taught that basically, you go shoot some footage, good, bad, whatever, and then you see what you&apos;ve captured. You edit that into a story, add narration, connective footage or documentation, but you do not go out with a &quot;script&quot; or any intention of the story coming out one way or another. It&apos;s harder, it doesn&apos;t assure an audience, it doesn&apos;t assure funding or box office or awards.\n\nBut it&apos;s honest. It&apos;s &quot;journalism.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s &quot;film truth.&quot;",

As the saying goes, the world ends with a whimper and not a bang.\n\nIn it&apos;s own way this is quite an effective little thriller along the lines of the old BBC television series from the 1970&apos;s, the &apos;Surviours.&apos; And as another fellow reviewer points out, also somewhat contemporary now with the threat of &apos;bird flu.&apos; Or indeed, other fearful epidemics like MRSA or even the constant threat of AIDS. Although, this was made before any of these awful diseases were known.\n\nThe acting is nothing to write home about and is standard at best, although, the actress playing Jessica, shines as a sardonic secretary.\n\nWhile not in the same class as films such as &apos;Outbreak&apos; or &apos;28 Days Later&apos; or even &apos;The Satan Bug,&apos; which use the same end-of-the-world plot line, this passes the time and holds the attention to the end. Also interesting is the final reward to the two people who help save the world.",

      "reviewBody": "Andre Morell&apos;s character, Dr. Forbes, makes a very unusual house call at the opening of &quot;The Plague of the Zombies.&quot; His old student, now practicing in a small (Victorian era) Cornish village, is mystified by the recent outbreak of deaths in that town, and even his wife, Alice, is starting to exhibit some strange lethargy. After Forbes arrives to help, he and his friend uncover a mix of voodoo, grave robbing and the undead, in this lesser known Hammer title that certainly deserves a greater renown. And thanks to the fine folks at Anchor Bay, this film&apos;s popularity may soon spread beyond its current cult reputation. &quot;Plague&quot; features an intelligent script, fine acting, solid photography and great atmosphere. Andre Morell&apos;s doctor makes for a very reassuring action hero, despite the actor&apos;s age (he was 57 at the time this picture was made). The film boasts three very chilling scenes: the first, nighttime appearance of a zombie on a hillside; the much-celebrated dream sequence; and Alice&apos;s rising from her grave. The smile on actress Jacqueline Pearce&apos;s face in this last scene is just haunting. Though marred by a somewhat disappointing finale, the film remains a minor horror masterpiece and one of the scariest works that I&apos;ve yet seen from the House of Hammer. This movie would make a wonderful double feature with the similarly themed &quot;White Zombie&quot; (1932), or with another Hammer film made that same year (1966), &quot;The Reptile,&quot; featuring Pearce again and the same director, John Gilling. Any way you watch it, though, the film is a real winner."

Kirstie Alley is pretty darn good as the dirty dealing former beauty queen and mother of the obvious next winner(Denise Richards). Miss Richards&apos; character is beautiful; but spoiled, pampered and a bitch. Not exactly an expose, because the behind the scenes back stabbing is assumed to be part of a beauty pageant. Tongue-in-cheek humor. Nevertheless another vehicle for the talented Miss Dunst.",

Prepare for an unexpected love quadrangle, some interesting lore on vampires, and great use of found footage.\n\nMy only complaint lies in a scene towards the end during which one of the weekend vampires&apos; lines were corny (writing) and poorly delivered (acting, directing).\n\nOne thing I especially like about Vampire Diary is that the first thirty minutes make a wonderful short story. I almost wished it ended at the water scene simply because of how great the movie was by that point. So, there you go. Give the first thirty minutes a shot. If you find yourself caring about the characters or interested in seeing what happens next, continue on for the remaining hour.",

      "reviewBody": "this low budget film, containing lots of technical mistakes, like a blue lettered title in a blue sky, also is an artfilm. it is using a language of pictures (which is wrongly called MTV-style) like the early and contemporary videoart: compilations of tv-pics, computer animations and filmtakes cutted in fast rhythms with an amazing non-musical soundtrack of voices and sounds, best example is the part in the gamehall, where the players melt with the game machines. another film which also use some tv/animation-parts is roland emmerich´s early film &quot;das archenoah prinzip&quot; , but in it there are not this fast rythms and it uses an electronic ambient sound combined with silence. back to decoder, irritating light and dialogues like ingmar bergman make this sci-fi to one of my favorite german films.\n\nsad: there are no more movies of this crew (i never heard of any other film from one of them)",

Jones escapes from an Irish prison and traces Bridges to Boston, where he plans on getting revenge on Bridges, his family, and the entire Boston Police Bomb Squad.\n\nThis movie really needed to be seen on the big screen because of all of the special effects - huge, frequent explosions.\n\nThe accents are all over the place, but the performances are good, with Lloyd Bridges on hand as a bearded character actor. It was a little too stereotypical for this viewer.\n\nThe script is by the numbers and derivative, but the actors and the tension engendered from defusing bombs attached to people helps hold interest.\n\nOkay, but see it on a large flat-screen TV.",

      "reviewBody": "For someone who made his name as an avant gardist and surfer of the New Wave Alain Resnais seems to be a closet dernier gardist with a penchant for stilted boulevard theater of another age.  In his current release, Pas Sur le bouche he preserves almost intact an operetta from a bygone age and here, as long ago as 1986, he ploughs a similar furrow and even uses two actors from his regular repertory - Arditi and Azema - who will re-surface in Pas sur le bouche.  Assuming that oiling the wheels of creaky vehicles is worth doing at all then Resnais does it as well as anyone and it would be bordering on the impossible to assemble a cast containing, in addition to Sabine Azema, Pierre Arditi (to say nothing of his sister), Fanny Ardant and Andre Dussolier and not produce a finished product worth watching.  It also says a lot for panellists and juries that one of them saw fit to bung Azema a major Best Actress gong for her work here.  It&apos;s difficult to nominate an audience for this but it would seem to be pitched at something between the semi-precious Gilbert Adair crowd and the popcorn brigade. 7/10"

Beatrice, or B. Monkey as she was known in her criminal life, tries to leave her old life behind her - but it proves very hard to shake off.\n\nThis is a great film and I enjoyed it immensely. It&apos;s a hugely stylish film and is beautifully shot.  The acting all round is tremendous but special honours should go to Asia Argento who gives a powerful and captivating performance.\n\nI really hope this film will do well around the world as it is greatly deserving of huge success.\n\nI saw this film on Saturday November 7th 1998, at the London Film Festival"

This movie was entertaining and I thought that there was some stuff that could be changed about it, but I still cut some slack to all kid&apos;s movies, because they are meant for kids and they sometimes make stuff in the movie unbelievable. Anyway, this is a nice kid&apos;s film and from my point of view, when I got through watching it I thought of it more as something an adult could be entertained by rather than a kid, because there were some parts where it would have gotten boring to the kid watching or even kind of scary the kid watching! So, I think this is one of the best new kid&apos;s films that has been released so far and I think you should see it for yourself if you don&apos;t believe me because it&apos;s harmless, charming fun.",

Mom (Anja Kling) and children must save him and hide him from hunters. Mr. Moose puppetry not entirely convincing.",

      "reviewBody": "MI6 agent James Bond is sent to infiltrate a diamond smuggling ring but soon uncovers a plot headed by his nemesis Blofeld that threatens the world.\n\nAfter George Lasnby&apos;s management declared he would not be returning, Sean Connery was lured back by UA with huge pay cheque (which he used to set up a foundation for Scottish artists). Connery has been unjustly accused of going through the motions the iconic role that made him is star. While he comes across campy at times due to his mannerisms not fitting his ageing looks, contrary to popular belief it&apos;s clear that he puts in 100 percent especially in the fight scenes notable the lift set up where he kills &apos;James Bond&apos;.\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton&apos;s use of the (at the time) contemporary setting of Las Vegas gives Diamonds a slightly dated look and it appears less classic than earlier outings, also the production feel cheaper especially compared to its predecessor.The practical stunts are great from the aforementioned lift fight, to the car chases and finale. Like its setting the score is less classic/traditional and very &apos;70s, of its day, but the theme (belted out wonderfully) by Shirley Bassey is excellent and the tune appears throughout. Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz&apos;s screenplay is as many of the Bond films - a mixture of great adventure and excitement, that is let down by some unnecessary injected humour as oppose to wittiness. However, it&apos;s interesting and different departing from the typical Bond style. This coupled with the real locations and Ken Adams toned down sets retain that Bond je ne sais quoi. \n\nCharles Gray who appears in You Only Live Twice (1967) as Henderson, is now main antagonist Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he&apos;s a great actor but at times hams it up in almost Rocky Horror show proportions and comes off quite comedic instead of dangerous. Both Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn as Q return in there enjoyable roles, Moneypenny notable not behind a desk and aids Bond. The supporting cast especially the crooks are well cast, older looking wise guys, gangster types that give the film a little weight. \n\nJill St. John as diamond smuggler Tiffany Case is refreshing as a Bond girl, while not the most classically beautiful, her character has a rough frank feistiness about her. The Blofeld&apos;s two villain accomplices are memorable and although clearly a gay couple, they are far more menacing than Blofeld himself especially Bruce Glover&apos;s Mr. Wint.\n\nMostly set in Vegas, California and Amsterdam it&apos;s also probably the least exotic of the Bond&apos;s. That said, it&apos;s still a fun adventure with one some of the most memorable dialogue of the series."

The premise was alright and the first few minutes set up the rest of the movie well. Unfortunately, the joke writing was bad. There were a few funny lines, but they were interwoven into a tapestry of mediocrity. I&apos;m pretty biased though because I don&apos;t like Charlie Day&apos;s shtick. He plays the exact same character as he does in Always Sunny, a really stupid guy who talks a mile a minute and if you listen carefully there&apos;s a few jokes in there. I don&apos;t enjoy that. I don&apos;t really like Jason Sudekis either. I find him bland and he plays an extremely dull character in this as well. You could take him out and the movie would still be mostly the same. Jason Bateman&apos;s character seems to be aware he&apos;s in a bad comedy. He doesn&apos;t really seem to like Sudekis or Day and treats all the wacky situations with a sort of slightly angry distaste. \n\nI watched Bridesmaids a few nights ago and enjoyed it way more than Horrible Bosses. That movie also had story line problems, but it had a lot of funny parts. That&apos;s all I want a comedy to do, make me laugh. Horrible Bosses didn&apos;t really do that for me, as the vast majority of its never-ending dialogue falls enormously flat."

He&apos;s now part of the Ice Age gang, if you will. This bonus short shows that he had built up quite a collection of acorns in a hollow tree. But, for some strange reason - call it &quot;perfectionism,&quot; that last acorn won&apos;t stay put where it is supposed to be. It keeps popping out. Instead of just leaving it as it is, which wouldn&apos;t have changed anything, Scrat goes out of his way to make it all look good.....and disaster is the result.\n\nWhat happens when his little nest of acorns is disrupted is too wild to describe here. It has to be seen to be believed. Of course, it&apos;s outrageous but it&apos;s a cartoon, and it is fun to watch. \n\nP.S. I viewed it a second time after writing the above review....and enjoyed it even more. This time I really appreciated all the funny noises Chris Wedge made, as Scat the squirrel.",

Moreover, with all of more or less authentic Gypsy features it has nothing to do with actual Gypsies. Gypsies here are metaphoric of some kind of people who follow different laws and rules than ordinary people; they are people who prefer the spiritual to the material, freedom to routine, passion to compromise, etc. With this approach most of the criticism expressed in some of the previous comments becomes irrelevant. \n\nIn the USSR there was no sex, it&apos;s true. There was passion and love -- love that burns. \n\nLove that burns -- that&apos;s what the film tells about, and for this good cause all means is of use: transgression, tantra, pagan cults, dionysism, dark magic. This story can be named as well a Russian Carmen. Brilliant performance of Emil Lotjanu (director), Eugene Doga (music), Serguey Vronsky (photography), Svetlana Toma (awarded as the best Soviet actress of the year for the part of Rada), Grigore Grigoriu(Zobar), Borislav Brondukov (Buca) and others. Great art of a great civilization. Get it and enjoy seeing."

The actors do a fantastic job, the roles of Messua and Patrick are incredible, you can really feel the love between them somehow. The little Tim is great at adding that cool &quot;kid role&quot; that I loved when I was a kid and saw it. Di Fazio and Vito are so much fun the way they act together, they seem like a married couple. Being set in India adds so much to the feel of the movie, the way the culture is different really is noticeable when Americans come there. I don&apos;t know what else to say except that if you haven&apos;t seen this movie, you should definitely do so. You won&apos;t regret it!",

Alvin Rakoff&apos;s direction makes the most of the location and the climax is well-managed."

Lemmy Caution, a fine parody of the American heavy, moves about like a featherweight. He often gets into wrestling matches with beautiful ladies, and it always has the grace of a ballet dance. Perfect light movies like this one are definitely an art form and easily digested. Incidentally: The story culminates in a big brawl in a cheese factory, the appropriate dessert.\n\nFriends of architecture watch carefully: In the first 10 minutes into the movie there is a small scene in front of the entrance facade of one of Le Corbusier&apos;s most famous private residences, the Villa Stein in Garches. I let you guess where this house is supposed to stand and which character resides in it."

There were a few two dimensional characters, but I felt the relationship between the soldiers was on point as well as some of the male bonding hazing. \n\nWhen one of the soldiers died you really felt the emotion of the team. \n\nThe special effects for the budget were pretty good and the ending was solid as was the build up. \n\nI would definitely watch a sequel to the movie.",

No, it&apos;s not perfection with respect to history.  The Spartans were hardly democratic or benevolent.  But, they were fiercely proud, great warriors and very independent.  The film does a fine job choreographing the 2-3 day battle, given the budget and FX limitations of the early 60&apos;s.  Very similar to &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; in these respects.  Richard Egan was excellent as Leonidas but the script was very limiting for him and the rest of the cast. I will look forward to seeing the film that results from Steven Pressfield&apos;s &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;.  Hopefully 40+ years of technology will create a true epic, as befitting an action (unknown to most school kids today) that helped preserve and push Western Civilization."

      "reviewBody": "This is a marvelous film.  Warren Beatty managed to film it just like a comic book MIGHT be brought to film with humourously grotesque and bizarre characters, beautiful colours, and a plot that really only could have come from a comic book.  The buildings, set design, make-up, and props are like nothing I have ever seen in film before.  Now, never having read the original strip leaves me out as far as making probably very insightful comparisons with this film and the original source.  That being said, I think that Beatty, although drastically changing some of the villains in the film to fit smaller roles, tried to keep the spirit of the film inside the comic strip.  Does that make sense?  Probably not.  Anyway, Dick Tracy offers a lot.  It is a visual feast with a decent story and some prime time stars doing some things you may not expect from them.  Beatty is very good as the lawmen, but much of the supporting cast steals many scenes from him. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice is sensational as an over-the-top thug out to get every criminal under his control, while he intermittenly quotes folks like Nietchze, Jefferson, and other historical figures.  Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles is wonderful - if you can finally figure out that it is him(notice in the scene where a stenographer is taking down what he says((That is Oscar winner Kathy Bates!))).  James Caan has a brief yet good scene with Pacino Godfather style and Beatty gives Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons cameos as well(both co-starring with him in Bonnie and Clyde).  Then there is Madonna.  She tries her best to live up to her name of Breathless and does a VERY credible job at it.  And then of course there is the music of Stephen Sondheim, an Oscar winner for this film.  It is very good and in some ways more memorable than much of what goes on in the film.  Perhaps a song here or there might have been cut, but for the most part the music greatly added to the overall effects created in the film.  Is Dick Tracy great?  No, but it is a whole lot better than it is generally given credit for.  In some ways its innovation must be reviewed again.  I think that for its type of film it is one of the best."

I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect as the film was recommended by a work colleague but I was completely bowled over.\n\nThe story line is about rage, despair, redemption. It tells the story of &quot;Tom&quot; who at the beginning of the film is some high flyer working fast, playing fast, reckless and at odds with himself. He goes too far and his life changes dramatically. He has to deal with new situations , way of life etc. He comes across his fragile neighbour Ines brilliantly played by Caroline Ducey, There is something translucent in Caroline, she offers so much to the character of Ines - the underlying sadness in her.\n\nWhat I loved about the film was how it was shot. It is more of a European genre, with scenes filmed in parts of London I don&apos;t even know exist (being a Londoner that a mean feat!). The cinematography is sublime with the essence of hope filtering through the lens as the story progresses - brilliant and beautiful.",

I didn&apos;t have much of a high expectation for this movie, nor did I know what it was about when I first saw it, but found myself involved with the story line as well as its characters. It&apos;s an adequate drama/mystery/time travel movie that has an overall good story development and message. \n\nThe movie centers a lot around family, and a mystery that has to do with a boy&apos;s missing father. Although the movie caught my attention from the beginning, I did find the middle part of the story a bit slow, but it got more interesting as the movie progresses - and it carried all the way through the rest of the movie. I recommend watching this if you&apos;re into a bit of time traveling, mystery, and drama.",

      "reviewBody": "`Gods and Generals&apos; plays less like a movie and more like a three-hour-and-49-minute long lesson in Civil War history.  Grueling and plodding, the film is almost the antithesis of `Gone With the Wind,&apos; in that while both films are epic tales told from the viewpoint of the defeated South, `Gods and Generals&apos; (unlike the earlier film) has been essentially drained of all emotion, drama and characterization.  `Gods and Generals&apos; may be a more `realistic&apos; war film than `Gone With the Wind&apos; (what wouldn&apos;t be?), but it&apos;s not nearly as entertaining.\n\n`Gods and Generals,&apos; which begins right after the firing on Fort Sumter and ends shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, is the first part of a planned trilogy.  Despite a handful of `name&apos; players in the cast (Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels, Mira Sorvino and even Ted Turner in a ludicrous cameo appearance), writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell is unable to bring a single character in his film to convincing life (with the possible exception of `Stonewall&apos; Jackson, who gets to carry the burden of what little drama the film has almost single-handedly).  In lieu of dialogue, the actors spend most of their time looking wistfully up to heaven or scanning the mist-shrouded horizon while delivering endless homilies about the rightness of the cause and the place of God in human affairs.  To keep it all palatable for more enlightened and egalitarian-minded modern audiences, the filmmakers are quick to have the Southern characters declare that, even though the South is forced to fight against the North to protect its God-given right to sovereignty, they, as individuals, are all personally opposed to slavery as an institution and firmly believe that their resident blacks will be freed someday as a matter of course.  Hell, the Northerners in this film seem more prejudiced against black people than the Southerners, who just can&apos;t say enough good things about their sycophantic slaves. \n\n The battle scenes, though well staged and appropriately graphic in nature, are strangely unmoving, primarily because we have no emotional stake in any of the characters we see doing the fighting.  Without anyone for us to focus on and care about, the audience becomes little more than curious bystanders, passive and unengaged observers of this brutal display of ritualized slaughter.  Although the visuals are splendid throughout, the musical score, except in a few places, is like a thick, heavy syrup poured over the entire film.\n\nBy providing subtitled identification of the principal people, places, dates and battles, `Gods and Generals&apos; does provide a service as a history lesson of sorts.  As a drama, however, the film is woefully lacking in every way imaginable.  `Gods and Generals&apos; may thrill the heart of the diehard Civil War buff.  The rest of us will have to stick to our dreams of Scarlett and Rhett, and of a romanticized vision of the South that only a Golden Age Hollywood mogul would have dared come up with."

After all, Sholder&apos;s name doesn&apos;t appear as the writer!!!!\n\nAnd it&apos;s always been said that a good director can make a terrific movie with a good script, because it inspires him/her, but not even a good director can make something from a bad script.\n\nI liked this movie when i first saw it and every time it&apos;s on I try and catch what I can of it.\n\nSomeone also said this is a &quot;leave your brain at the door&quot; type movie.  I don&apos;t think so because this movie lets you guess what&apos;s happening without explaining everything or hitting you over the head with superfluous dialogue; it doesn&apos;t insult your intelligence, and I thank both the writer and director for that."

      "reviewBody": "Six stories are told which are centered on man-woman or to be precise, husband-wife relationship on different facets of life and age.\n\nThe inter-weaving part is a struggle by a filmmaker which drags a lot and lacks substance. While the direction is poor, script writing is fresh. Although, since the execution is bottom-notch, I had to yawn a couple of times in the first half. Second half is average.\n\nOut of the six stories, I liked two: one which talks about a couple who see a &apos;mirror&apos; for the first time and the repercussions of it which stars Meghna Raj &amp; Jayasuriya; both are good. Second one is about a just-wed couple where the wife (Nithya Menon) is mad about her better half&apos;s (Boban Kunchako) probable fascination to Indian porridge (payasam)! The film ends with the main story&apos;s lead character narrating a rather wicked climax to his producers.\n\nThe rest four were below average stories but the performances were good specially of Indrajith &amp; Siddique!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: 50% recommended because the last story will make you laugh a lot. But, be warned about the lagging, novice first half!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: No | Sex, Nudity or Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence or Gore: No | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Very Mild | Drugs: No",

      "reviewBody": "I was excited to watch this film on PBS after an early holiday dinner. It certainly didn&apos;t get off to a good start, with the young Bohemian roommates overacting and over-singing, about nothing at all. Apparently, director Robert Dornhelm had no idea how to play that down. Or else he didn&apos;t bother; I don&apos;t know. Rolando Villazón should have been encouraged to start off in a more subtle way, with less volume and less mugging. And the makeup artists surely could have done something to make him appear less lugubrious.\n\nIt was disappointing to see Anna Netrebko, a riveting actress and singer, so ill-used. Again, there must have been some way to make her appear both more attractive and more interesting; on stage, she is gorgeous and completely unique. The split-screen technique made no sense and added nothing to the drama, while scenes that featured people singing off-screen were confusing and boring.\n\nI&apos;m sure this is not entirely the director&apos;s fault. Grand opera fares best on the stage, and often appears stiff and overblown in film versions. Probably the best idea would simply have been to film the singers performing on stage in front of an audience. We would have gotten the benefit of verisimilitude, and the dramatic gestures and heroic singing that opera demands would have seemed much more fitting.\n\nOh, well!",

An idea of this film is very original although I saw many movies about lucky guys who won quite a few money like &quot;Brewster&apos;s Millions&quot;, &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; or &quot;Mr. Billion&quot; but these were all American films. &quot;Ah! Si j&apos;étais riche&quot; is the story very similar to real life. The main character Aldo is not handsome man, he&apos;s not successful, he&apos;s miser and he has very bad disposition but easy money won&apos;t make him happy never, maybe just better and cleverer. It&apos;s remarkable situation comedy with good sense and nice humor. I recommend its everybody who wants just to relax after hard work day and to look an easy funny film.",

It&apos;s like looking right into the mind of a man pushed to the brink, a man capable of anything.  The film darkly builds as we watch the main character fall lower and lower, becoming more and more desperate. I love a movie that can capture an emotion so strongly, and this film defiantly grabs you and does not let go.  The tension literally drips off the screen making it difficult at times to take, but like a car crash, you can&apos;t take your eyes off of it.\n\nNoe&apos;s direction is excellent.  The pace is slow and methodical and cut up with a surprising sound affect that makes you jump almost every time you hear it.  This just adds to the disturbing, uneasy atmosphere that the film creates. \n\nIts a trip that not all people should take, but those of you how are not easily offended, and have a strong stomach and a good eye for art, you should go far out of you way to see this film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is one of a kind. I didn&apos;t realize it before, but there is a severe lack of films that take on menstruation, especially in such an honest way. Typically, periods are used as a gag or a gimmick, if even mentioned at all. Surely this relates back to the lack of representation for women in filmmaking. Lucky for us, Dorie Barton tackles periods for what they are, an important part of every girl&apos;s life.\n\nGirl Flu follows 12 year old Bird as she gets her first period (in front of her classmates, might I add). Embarrassed and understandably confused, she turns to her mom for help. Her mom, however, is the least responsible of the two, sort of a stoner, and has a knack for making everything about herself. As Bird tries to come to terms with this new chapter of her life, her mom (Jenny) is busy trying to piece her own life together. The dynamic between the two is perfectly portrayed. \n\nThis film is beautifully shot, written, and directed with an incredible cast led by Jade Pettyjohn who delivers a brilliant performance as Bird. Katee Sackhoff takes what would usually be an unlikeable character (Jenny) and turns her into a woman that we can all relate to (at least on some level). Jeremy Sisto is also amazing as Arlo, Jenny&apos;s boyfriend and voice of reason. I also want to mention the other young cast members, Diego Josef (Carlos) and Isabella Acres (Rachel), on their wonderful performances as Bird&apos;s love interest and Bird&apos;s sworn enemy.\n\nTo sum it up, Girl Flu is a refreshing coming-of-age film that&apos;s funny, real, and so damn lovable. Thank you Dorie Barton for taking every girl&apos;s story and turning it into a beautiful piece of art.",

      "reviewBody": "Shi Mian Mai Fu belongs to a growing body of work that embodies a clearly Asian aesthetic packaged just as clearly for Western consumption. It is no coincidence that, each time I paused the DVD for whatever reason, the still image on the screen was as beautiful as any classic wood block print by Hiroshige or Hokusai. Xiaoding Zhao&apos;s elegant cinematography imbues every scene with haunting beauty. Think Tak Fujimoto times ten, with no disrespect meant to Fujimoto, who shoots Western movies and still manages to inject his refined visual sense into such great films as Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense.\n\nDirector Yimou Zhang&apos;s work in Hero was more epic, more heroic, but SMMF has a more refined sense of story. The cast, the scenery, the music, including vocal performances by the legendary Kathleen Battle; all elements conspire brilliantly to convey subtle and nuanced meaning in moments. The story, as do all good stories of this genre, revolves around a delicate interplay of love, betrayal, deception and heroism of many different kinds, and, oh yes, those stunning ballets of combat layered with evocative sounds and effects.\n\nIn a nutshell, the plot goes something like this. A beautiful blind showgirl is captured as a spy. Her captors conspire to trick her into leading them to her leader. Along the way, both hunter and quarry become entangled in a web of subterfuge and deception. Add in a beautifully tragic romantic story line, again, as all such movies must have, and never forget that the essence of all truly great tragedy is inevitability.\n\nThis movie is also known as Ambush From Ten Sides, and in that more literal translation of its title you will find its essence. A worthy successor to Hero, though not as magnificent as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, in which Ziyi Zhang gives the performance of a lifetime and the one against all her other roles will be judged, and in this case, fall short, House of Flying Daggars is nevertheless a feast for the senses and a fully satisfying cinematic experience.",

      "name": "Great effects, a broadly admirable production - but the intended plot is sadly weak and incogent",
      "reviewBody": "The premise catches one&apos;s eye, certainly, promising all the blood and gore a fan of horror cinema could want. But it was reading about the production that piqued my interest. It&apos;s one matter to note the experience Fujiwara Kei boasts in her career, both in her collaborations with Tsukamoto Shinya and elsewhere. It&apos;s another matter to learn of the extremely low budget; the personal involvement of the cast to also serve as crew members while effectively funding the endeavor themselves; the sets and materials that were quite literally cobbled together; and the apparent necessitated frugality of shooting only one take for any given scene so as to conserve film stock. Some terrific movies have been made with little more than earnest care and hard work, and the nitty gritty of this project is endearing, and even kind of inspiring. I admit that without particularly thinking about it I formed high expectations on the basis of these factors; &apos;Organ&apos; seemed to be primed for a good time.\n\nI&apos;m therefore sad to say that my expectations have been only party met, a mixed success, and I&apos;m a little disappointed. I really do admire the effort that all involved poured into this flick, and they are to be roundly commended for their contributions, including committed acting. Nasa Kenji&apos;s music is applied somewhat unevenly, but the synth-driven themes are nonetheless a treat for the ears, lending to the dark aura about the proceedings. The production design and art direction are splendid, being drab and dreary and full of detail, and in my opinion they never betray their humble origins. The costume design, hair, and makeup are sharp. Sometimes Fujiwara&apos;s direction or cinematography are particularly striking. There really are some swell ideas on hand. And there&apos;s certainly no mistaking that the blood, gore, special makeup, and otherwise practical effects are excellent, and decidedly nasty; it&apos;s evident how much attention went into this foremost attraction of the picture, and all involved turned in fine work to being the seedy tableau to bear in the most vividly disgusting manner.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything in this feature received the same degree of focus. While some examples are great, at other points I&apos;m distinctly unimpressed with how this was shot, and at some points the direction and cinematography come off as sloppy. Nasa&apos;s music is appreciable, but his editing is surely less so, and some of the sequencing plainly raises a skeptical eyebrow as it dubiously chops up the proceedings. And for as strong as the effects are, the narrative that sets the stage for them is simply a mess. There are good ideas, yes, but from the very start the storytelling is wildly incohesive, and almost incoherent. &apos;Organ&apos; is so-so about identifying its characters, and the scene writing struggles to cogently convey the beats and underlying notions that one would suppose should advance and enrich the story. Under all these circumstances the plot development is desperately scattered, and all we can hope for in terms of a narrative is not concrete information, but broad vibes imparting a very loose idea of the course of events. I can tell you some of what happens throughout the runtime, but that&apos;s in no small part thanks to the outside context of a synopsis that someone else wrote. This title is not an abstruse mind-bender; it should not be necessary to trust in someone else&apos;s description to help discern what is transpiring.\n\nIt&apos;s hardly that the film is outright bad. It doesn&apos;t quite seem right to criticize it for being generally unpolished, either, because that&apos;s just the nature of how it was made. Yet there&apos;s no question that for all the skill, intelligence, and passion that genuinely went into the production, the least of it all went into the writing, and in turn to ensuring that the plot was meaningfully established in execution. Granted, on the one hand one could argue that plot isn&apos;t specifically integral to a flick about murder and illicit organ trade; on the other hand, Fujiwara obviously meant for this to have solid storytelling as an anchor for the gruesome madness, and that is absolutely not what happened here. If all you want out of genre fare is crimson and viscera, you&apos;ll get what you came for, but it&apos;s apparent enough that on account of her own shortcomings as writer and director Fujiwara&apos;s vision fails to fully crystallize, and as far as I&apos;m concerned the violence and ugliness in and of itself just isn&apos;t enough to compensate. I don&apos;t dislike &apos;Organ,&apos; but it altogether comes up short in what it was meant to be, and any recommendation I might offer is only a very soft one tempered with caveats.",

But this brilliant comedy definitely is one of those films that rely heavily on the viewer&apos;s understanding of the wider cultural context - and, of course, on magnificently humorous dialogues and interaction. (If a comparison must be found, I&apos;d say it is much more reminiscent of Tati than of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, for example.) \n\nIt is an unforgettably hilarious yet gentle film. But without the help of a very good translator - and preferably at least a basic understanding of the time and space where the action takes place - I fear that much (not all, but much) of its intelligent humour will be lost.",

It takes place mostly in closed sets and contains lengthy discussions of military strategy but never drags whilst the acting of its excellent cast is devoid of histrionics. Mikhail Derzhavin as Muryavyov is a composite of several actual generals.\n\nFor once Uncle Joe does not appear and is simply referred to as &apos;The Highest Commander&apos; and unusually for the time, the Germans are neither demonised nor indeed underestimated. Gavril Popov&apos;s score is sparingly used but most effective.\n\nWinner of the Palme d&apos;Or, this is arguably Fridrikh Ermler&apos;s finest film although some would say that the honour should go to &apos;Fragments of an Empire&apos;. His relative inactivity during the next ten years is both mystifying and a waste of talent.",

I was disappointed. What I saw was a scary movie. I am not by nature claustrophobic but a few scenes of the close quarters they were climbing through left me squirming in my seat. I can&apos;t continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn&apos;t expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can&apos;t say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Kuntilanak Vs Pocong is a 2008 Indonesian horror film that pits two of the country&apos;s most famous monsters against each other: the kuntilanak, a female ghost with long hair and a white dress, and the pocong, a corpse wrapped in white cloth. The film is a bit of a mess, but it&apos;s also a lot of fun, especially if you&apos;re into Indonesian horror movies.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple: a group of teenagers go on a camping trip to a haunted forest, where they are attacked by both a kuntilanak and a pocong. The teenagers must fight for their lives as they try to escape the forest.\n\nThe film is full of cheesy special effects and bad acting, but that&apos;s part of what makes it so much fun. The kuntilanak and pocong are both pretty scary, and the film has a few genuinely suspenseful moments.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of Indonesian horror movies, then you definitely need to check out Kuntilanak Vs Pocong. It&apos;s not a perfect film, but it&apos;s a lot of fun and it&apos;s sure to give you a few scares.\n\nI love watching this movie with irony. It&apos;s so ridiculous and over-the-top, but it&apos;s also surprisingly suspenseful and scary at times. The special effects are cheesy, but that&apos;s part of what makes the movie so much fun.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kuntilanak Vs Pocong is the way it uses Indonesian folklore. The kuntilanak and pocong are both iconic creatures in Indonesian culture, and the film does a great job of bringing them to life.",

It probably escaped the attention of most people until the rebels struck inside Russia in Beslan, where 300 people, mainly children, were murdered on the first day of school. The 2006 film, Beslan: Three Days in September, shows that tragedy.\n\nThe thing that grabs you about this film is the fact that is seems so much a home movie. One of the three individuals, Ramzan, has a video camera that is with him always. He uses it to film Ruslan&apos;s family when he is not working. It is something that we can all relate to.\n\nBut, under the surface is an ominous portent. It seems that most of the time they are talking about people in the past. And they are.\n\nWatching Ramzan film from his Aunt&apos;s apartment during the invasion, there are moments of levity when they are three hours from New Year&apos;s Day (1995), and they are talking of the fireworks outside.\n\nBut, such levity is rare as a depression creeps in over the people when they realize that war will not end.\n\nMost Americans have no concept of war. This film brings it home and shows what a terrible tragedy the world faces.",

      "reviewBody": "Korea, the late era of Joseon dynasty: Gyu-yeob (Jae-hyeon Jo) is a brutal but skilled warrior who starts tracing a mysterious assassin who has been murdering the King&apos;s ministers. Soon clues point to the assassin being Gyu-yeob&apos;s old military friend Ji-hwan (Min-su Choi) who he has fond but tragic memories of. What is the truth behind the revolutionary killer and his female assistant Shi-yeong (Bo-kyeong Kim)?\n\nAs can be expected from a historical epic, the sets, costumes and massive group scenes look authentic and the colours of the cinematography, such as the green forests and blue night scenes are a joy to the eye. Still, it&apos;s harder to sink into the world of the film than in, say, Yimou Zhang&apos;s masterpiece Hero, largely because of the restless camera-work that would be better suited in an urban modern-day action thriller than a historical warrior epic. The camera spins around the characters, constantly tracks them, shakes as if in the hands of an epileptic and even goes to very blurry slow motion for long periods of time, making the already hectic fight scenes confusing to follow. The calmer, more static shots in the peaceful scenes look very nice though; I wish this approach would have been used more prominently.\n\nTechnical direction issues aside, the film&apos;s writing isn&apos;t really among my favourites of the genre either. As Gyu-yeob is such a cold and aloof warrior, it is difficult to relate to him and his emotions about his long-forgotten friendship with Ji-hwan. Now the lengthy flashback scene detailing their time together interrupts the main plot for too long; perhaps a traditional chronological structure or showing smaller flashbacks more evenly would have worked better. The long-haired Ji-hwan is a stylish character though and easily carries the scenes where he is in. The female Shi-yeong receives less attention and her role doesn&apos;t come across a very significant one, despite her implied importance to Ji-hwan.\n\nIn summary, I think Sword in the Moon is a visually good-looking, but not very effectively directed epic in which the nature of friendship is a major theme. A calmer style of presenting the action scenes would have benefited the whole significantly and suited the extravagant, even pompous, music better. I guess the characters could also have been fleshed out better, but in spite of my complaints, the film is not terrible and fans of historical sword epics should find it easily watchable – give it a chance if this type of cinema is your thing.",

However, the character of Manu appears to be completely pointless and more than a little irritating. Take him out the equation and 3 Zeros would be a far more enjoyable film. He just gets in the way of Colonna&apos;s against-the-odds/revenge storyline.\n\nI do think this film was more a devious marketing ploy than a fully-fledged cinematic production. In saying that, 3 Zeros isn&apos;t entirely unbearable. Yes, as an objet d&apos;art, it is bland and pisspoor, but as a snackette of light entertainment it&apos;s not too bad.",

During this years of fear, confusion ans sex liberation there were tons of experimental movies. This is one of them. So, if you like solid scripts and action, get way from this film.\n\nThis film is an experience like a David Lynch movie, very hypnotic and seducing if you are caught in it.\n\nIt&apos;s also a sequel - or a reply - to Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s &quot;Le Mepris&quot;. First, there&apos;s Piccoli (sometimes he&apos;s dressed the same as in &quot;Le Mepris&quot;) and there are many scenes who work as an echo of Godard&apos;s movie (the arguing scene, the jump in the sea...) Like a french critic said &quot;Dillinger&quot; is like &quot;Le Mepris&quot; with Brigitte Bardot on the first floor sleeping.\n\nSo, not a film as experimental and &quot;destroy&quot; as it seemed at first look. Unusual for sure but worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "First off,  I would like to say that have actually seen the actual film in its original form, not from watching an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. So my comments are entirely based on my watching the film without the benefit of Rod, Servo and the rest of those imbeciles whose names I have forgotten.\n\n  The first thing that amazed me about this film is not that its makers managed to get this film released, the fact that they managed to sell a film so cheap looking to major studio like Warner Brothers. I would love to known what sales pitch they used to sell it to WB executives. This film by the way, turned up a support feature for the  second Godzilla movie, GIGANTIS,THE FIRE MONSTER, which Warner Brothers also distributed.\n\n   The acting in the film is amateurish and dialog delivery is stilted. The actors delivery of the lines is reminiscent of the stilted dubbed dialog heard in those cheap Italian made spectacles that were just about to flood the American market when this film came out. The films plot is loaded with more holes than swiss cheese. Perhaps the most ludicrous element of the film is the Gargon, which is nothing more than a macro enlarged lobster (or is it a crayfish?). On the plus side I was surprised that director Tom Graef used more camera set ups and camera movement than is usually found in a lowbudget picture of this nature. This makes TEENAGERS FROM OUTERSPACE not as dreary as other very low budget films from the same period like THE ASTOUNDING SHE MONSTER."

      "reviewBody": "The very first &quot;sound track&quot; film from MGM..sound effects track added by Doug Shearer, who did the sound recording on about 90% of all the old black &amp; whites. Caption cards are still used throughout the film for the dialogue. Was also actually filmed in Tahiti, which would have been pretty rare for those times. Monte Blue ( plays Doctor Lloyd ) and Robert Anderson (the trader) had been in silent films for years, but this was Raquel Torres&apos; (&quot;Fayaway&quot;) first role. In our story, when pearls are discovered in the waters of the south seas, the white men move in to take advantage. The natives are up against the caucasian traders, the critters of the sea, storms, and sickness when it comes to their shores. The story is quite simple, but the outdoor and underwater photography are the high points here. Even with a respectable restoration, different scenes appear in various colors, and the lighting and sound have become slightly spotty. Interesting scenes at the feast, where prior to cooking, the fish is carefully sewn up in leaves to keep it from burning. Where others have despaired over the &quot;documentary&quot; feel to the film, I felt that this was one of the strengths. (Although some of those costumes and dances DO look pretty hokey.) Lloyd lives with the natives, and must decide what his long term goal is, and how to reach it. Several scenes have been sped up, which may have been an effort by &quot;someone&quot; to move the plot along more quickly. Or maybe just newer technology going at a different speed. Directed by WS Van Dyke, produced by Thalberg and Stromberg, all pretty big cheeses in the industry at the time.",

But as a piece of exploitation/porn from Italy&apos;s rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish it had the really poorly dubbed English, I think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. The only white guy who gets laid in the movie is &quot;Mark Shannon&quot;- he is the moustache wearing, hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he &quot;steps up to bat&quot;. This was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic. Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having &quot;doggie-style&quot; sex with a woman. I can&apos;t help but laugh.\n\nThis is one of those movies that I pray my future wife and kids never find.",

L&apos;Effrontee shows how hard it is to live as a neglected child with desires and aspirations. Claude Miller&apos;s poetic mis- en-scene imparted divine exquisiteness to a pure tale of uncertainty. Charlotte experiences the passage from childhood to adolescence in a difficult manner. Miller has created one of the best coming of age film in years. Things become tough for Charlotte when she is introduced to an alien world of music. She reminds us of our childhood dreams and frustrations. Miller has always championed the cause of young characters in his films portraying complex personal relationships. L&apos;Effrontee is similar to his earlier film &quot;La meilleure facon de marcher&quot; as he has aimed to portray joys and sorrows experienced by adolescents in their formative years. As a cinéaste who learned his métier from Truffaut, Claude Miller will continue to create stories of troubled childhoods.",

After watching the film my conclusion was that the movie going public was looking for more serious work in the post World War 2 world. Before 1942 this might have actually made some money for Paramount.\n\nStanwyck plays a Virginia girl from the country club horsey set who married a Yankee writer played by Robert Cummings. Barbara loves her horses and her husband can&apos;t stand them and is not at one with the horse when he tries to ride.\n\nThere&apos;s also Patric Knowles who is a neighbor and who is after Barbara and mushmouth southern belle Diana Lynn who is circling like a bird of prey over Bob.\n\nThe climax is a steeplechase race with Cummings as a game, but totally hopeless rider. Prety funny stuff.\n\nNot the best of Stanwyck films out there, but not too bad.",

The movie&apos;s soundtrack is one of very few on my ipod that I can listen to daily, after watching the movie the first time it&apos;s really worth it just to go back and re-watch it, focusing on the scenes with the backing tracks. They really add amazing atmosphere (and meaning to a small few scenes in particular!) Rainie is amazing as Jade, especially for those that are familiar with her music and drama roles. As soon as the music rolls, the intro titles come up and the viewers see rainie for that first time as Jade, you&apos;ll realise you&apos;re in for a real treat! Some parts of the movie, typical of foreign movies (if you&apos;re a frequent viewer) leave you sitting there thinking, &apos;what...?&apos; but tie in with the script towards the end, if just barely.\n\nOne thing that I really liked, which others may not, is that it is definitely original, unpredictable, and the relationship between the main characters has you glued to the screen in anticipation. Definitely one of my favourite movies that is watched over and over and over.....",

It ranks as my all time favorite.\n\nI recently bought the DVD and was amazed that, despite having seen this film for the umpteenth time, I am still incredibly moved, often to tears.\n\n The final narrative, to me, is the ultimate motion picture experience and delivers the promise of what certain movies can do if they set their sights high enough...and that is elevate the viewer and give them an experience that transcends beyond the mere act of watching, but gives lessons in life that one will remember and use for years to come.\n\nMore than anything, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; is about family and how the choices we individually make may take us down different paths, but can never dilute our bonds and love. Watching it, I am constantly reminded of the paths my own brother and I have made and how differently our lives have turned out.\n\nBut back to the film. It is understated, and yet blissfully exquisite in expressing its passion for life.\n\nI actually learned flyfishing after seeing this for the first time a decade ago. In this movie flyfishing is a spiritual experience and represents a total communion with nature. It is during flyfishing that, despite the paths the characters have chosen, they can toss everything else aside and be bound to each other for all time. \n\nThere are many movies I love, but this is the only one that causes me to get chills over and over again. \n\nThis movie is sheer perfection. I continue to be haunted by waters.",

      "reviewBody": "There is an underground culture of performing arts that often goes overlooked or under-appreciated. The artists that dedicate their entire lives to the art form often come from meager lifestyles and impoverished conditions. But when they perform, whether it lasts for ten minutes or thirty seconds, they have the power to captivate your entire soul. Planet Bboy takes place during the Battle of the Year competition in 2005 and documents the culture that originated in the urban streets of New York City and spread like wildfire all over the world. Crews from all over the world strive to be the best, and to be the best they must grace the center stage of the entire world of b-boying, &quot;Battle of the Year.&quot; One crew represents each of the participating countries to compete in the grandest bboy battle in the entire world. The prize money is close to nothing. The true prize is to create a name for yourself, to earn respect and recognition, and most of all to be the best in the world. The documentary focuses primarily on five different crews, Knucklehead Zoo from Las Vegas, Ichigeki from Japan, Phase-T from France, Last for One from Korea, and the reigning champions the Gamblerz also from Korea.\n\nEach crew possesses their own unique style and presence, and the documentary shows the strong bond within each crew. The power moves and stunts are crazy! However, the heart of the film lies in the individual life stories. Bboys who want nothing more in life but to dance often come in conflict with the interests of the families, especially those who live in poverty.\n\nPlanet Bboy is powerful, raw with emotions, not to mention hilarious. The interactions between the bboys and their families provide moments of heartfelt emotion and moments of true hilarity as the facial expressions on the bboys say that they&apos;ve heard these lectures their whole lives. We feel for them when the pursuit of their dreams is rejected, and cheer for them when they are appreciated. Great moments also arise when the bboy crews from different countries finally get together and experience a culture shock that is both threatening and awkward.\n\nThe film has the same heart and passion as the bboys have for their artistic outlet of dance. I can&apos;t remember the last time a movie made me cry. Planet Bboy was the first film in a long time I had to pretend there was something in my eye.\n\nI left the film feeling a deeper appreciation for dance as well as the quality of life. Life is not worth living unless you dare to dream.",

      "reviewBody": "And this is the result of when you decide to make a cannibal movie in your own backyard. But I am getting ahead of myself here...\n\nOf course I was not familiar with the 1980 French cannibal movie &quot;Terreur Cannibale&quot; (aka &quot;Cannibal Terror&quot;) prior to stumbling upon it by random chance here in 2024. And given the fact that it is a horror movie, more specifically a cannibal movie, that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a chance. However, I wasn&apos;t exactly harboring the biggest of expectations to the movie, given its age and premise.\n\nI will say that the movie definitely starts out all chipper and cheerful, with that wonderful music, and thus setting what I assume is a false sense of calm, security and complacency within the viewers. But knowing that it is a cannibal-themed movie, of course we know that things are about to change at some point.\n\nThe storyline in the movie, as concocted by writers Jesús Franco, Julio Pérez Tabernero and H. L. Rostaine, fell short of entertaining me. It was not a particularly entertaining storyline, and the character gallery was flat and one-dimensional. Truth be told, I didn&apos;t care one bit about the characters, and the mediocre acting performances didn&apos;t exactly help to cement the characters as memorable.\n\nNeedless to say that I wasn&apos;t familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie. And while that is usually something I do enjoy when I watch a movie, I just didn&apos;t enjoy it in &quot;Terreur Cannibale&quot; as the performances were amateurish, wooden, rigid and devoid of emotion and commitment.\n\nSure, there were some gory scenes in the movie, but it was hardly sufficient to make up for the rest of movie, which was a terrible disappointment. But visually, then you&apos;re not in for anything grand here, should you opt to sit down and watch this movie. And as for the tribal native cannibals, well they didn&apos;t even look to be natives, they felt like random extras the film crew had hired off of the street, as they were a ragged band of mixed races, and the white guy with the muttonchops was the icing of the cake, as it was as far from being a jungle native as you could get.\n\nOf course, the cannibal movies of the 1970s and 1980s weren&apos;t exactly cinematic masterpieces, but &quot;Terreur Cannibale&quot; was definitely in the lower end of the scale.\n\nI would not recommend that you should waste 93 minutes of your life on watching this movie. Some of us did, so you don&apos;t have you; you&apos;re quite welcome.\n\nMy rating of directors Alain Deruelle, Olivier Mathot and Julio Pérez Tabernero&apos;s 1980 movie &quot;Terreur Cannibale&quot; lands on a generous two out of ten stars.",

For me, this is a road-movie and a love declaration to brazilian music - that deserves it completely ! Period. Although one can be frustrated by the quick pace of this journey, this is another proof of how diverse brazilian music is ! Ok, some musicians have no real mesmerizing philosophical discourse during their interviews, but I view those passages as necessary - and interesting - steps to music, as it shows first of all human beeings living from and with music, and not cynical professionals as the star system can provide. Kaurismäki concludes its documentary with his decision to buy a bar in Rio where artists play every night. &quot;Moro no Brazil&quot;, he says. Lucky man !!!",

      "reviewBody": "As an audience, watching with English subtitles, I was not particularly familiar with Hungarian culture or history beforehand, but nevertheless felt touched by this portrait of a love and an era. The film treats its subjects delicately, using history as both a backdrop and catalyst for the romantic plot line, and also allowing it to become a direct subject at times; the country and times are inseparable from the lives they contain.\n\nThe romance is... beautiful. It is built up to an almost unbearable degree, such that you feel the romantic tension gradually but forcefully. The chemistry between the two lead actors is brilliant.\n\nThe directing style also lends the film a unique flavour. Time and setting are interwoven, so that the only absolute is the love of the two protagonists. Flashbacks and asides are used to add to the dramatic mood of film, but don&apos;t overshadow it. All in all, a truly excellent film.",

      "reviewBody": "firstly i&apos;m a huge wilco fan and therefore was always going to like this, even if it was directed by michael bay and shot on a ninety eighties camcorder. It has fantastic footage that allows you to get into the &apos;wilco world&apos; and generally made me very jealous.\n\nhowever i don&apos;t believe sam jones has any clout as a film maker. The biggest flaw seems to be that it doesn&apos;t get what yankee hotel foxtrot really is as an album. Even in the commentary Jeff Tweedy shows his surprise at jones&apos; inclusion of live versions of songs from earlier albums like &apos;being there&apos;.\n\nThe big problem is that the album clearly changed a great deal after mr bennett left the band and jim o rourke turned a collection of good and slightly less than good rock songs into a ground-breaking piece of rock and roll. O rourke made the album great, hearing the versions that were painstakingly put together before Jim came on board proves this and yet Jones failed to make him a central part of the doc, relagated him to one joint interview with Jeff Tweedy when he says nothing.\n\nUnfortunately this film only tells half the story and therefore feels half-finished and padded out with lots of material that could have been put on the, already very healthy, special features discs. Having said all this it is still worth watching but not worth worshipping, a bit like yankee hotel foxtrot (unless you&apos;re listening to it on vinyl of course!).",

If you don&apos;t fall into this group, or couldn&apos;t really care less about old video games, then you should probably pass on this film.

      "reviewBody": "A four-headed team clumsily ends up stuck in a jungle. Pretty soon, two of them die (rather clumsy again) while savage aborigines are chasing the other two males. The duo depletes one last time when one of them disappears during a wild-river flow does it have to be saidclumsy! The supposedly last cannibal tribe on earth imprisons the one man left, named Robert. They don&apos;t start cooking him just yet, but fool around with him a little, first. He escapes and takes a local girl with him, who serves the role of beautiful hostage. However, the journey through the undiscovered jungle is hard, long and full of surprises. \n\nRuggero Deodato&apos;s general rehearsal before unleashing the notorious `Cannibal Holocaust&apos; upon the world is an explicit horror film, but not as shocking or repulsive as its successor. This film merely serves as an old-fashioned adventure-movie, there were Cannibal Holocaust is a severely shocking ethical portrait. If you ignore all the illogicalness of this film, you&apos;ll have yourself a good time. That&apos;s a fact. It&apos;s a rough and straight-to-the-point horror production with more than enough footage to keep you entertainedalthough a lot depends on your definition of entertainment, of course. Italian horror standards stand throughout the whole film: gore, sleaze and cruelty! Since so many things are happening during the first 20 minutes of `Jungle Holocaust&apos;, the film tends to get tedious after a whileor so you would think! Surprisingly enough, there still are more than enough adrenalin-filled sequences that keep you alert and  and this really is positive in my book  Deodato gives an excellent portrayal of how someone is unintentionally driven into complete madness and a total loss of realism. Jungle Holocaust contains quite a lot of animal cruelty, which can be regarded as offensive by Italian horror-haters. The crocodile-dissection easily equals the vicious tortoise slaughtering in `Cannibal Holocaust&apos;. The cannibals themselves are some of the wickedest I ever saw and they seem to follow some bizarre rituals, too. They show an unusual interest for male nudity and they don&apos;t seem to worry too much about controversial handlings such as murdering an infant (pretty disturbing sequence that was). They do bring forward beautiful women, as Me Me Lai is the sexiest native girl I ever saw. Jungle Holocaust is essential viewing for Italian horror/sleaze fans. Not as memorable as `Holocaust&apos; or `Ferox&apos;but certainly worth your time.",

      "name": "Pivotal Movie in Young Robert Taylor&apos;s Career",
      "reviewBody": "Two movies 20 years apart based on the same book about a woman who&apos;s blinded in a car accident proved pivotal to a pair of future well-known actors. The earliest film involved young Robert Taylor, whose screen presence exponentially increased after his performance in December 1935&apos;s &quot;Magnificent Obsession.&quot; Adapted from Lloyd Douglas&apos; 1929 weepy novel, Taylor played a spoiled brat who was in love with the stricken woman, but suddenly gains maturity by motivating himself to become a brain surgeon.\n\nTaylor was in his second year in Hollywood, and saw some success in his earlier appearance in &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936.&quot; Casting the character of the son from a wealthy family whose love for the bottle was more important than treating people decently was crucial for the John Stahl-directed movie. After several choices were considered to play opposite actress Irene Dunn, Taylor was selected, with positive results.\n\n&quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; bounces from one tragedy to the next, but contains shining examples of sacrificing oneself for the greater good of human kind. Taylor plays the wisecracking Robert Merrick, whose drunken accident nearly kills him, only to be saved by the local hospital&apos;s only ventilator. Trouble is, at the same time Robert was hogging the sole ventilator, the highly esteemed generous philanthropist Dr. Hudson dies because of the same hospital&apos;s lack of another ventilator. Dr. Hudson&apos;s younger wife, Helen (Dunne), loathes the young man whom she feels is responsible for her husband&apos;s death. Robert meets and falls for the widow (in real life Irene was 35 to Taylor&apos;s 24). Driving her home, he becomes aggressive in his passion. Helen escapes his clutches by jumping out of the parked car, only to be struck by a passing automobile. &quot;When his character makes the transition from self-absorbed playboy to dedicated doctor and committed philanthropist,&quot; describes film reviewer Sean Axmaker, &quot;you can see the guilt and regret in his face and the seriousness in his new demeanor.&quot;\n\nThe author of &apos;Magnificent Obsession,&apos; Lloyd Douglas, a former church minister who is also known for his 1942 novel &apos;The Robe,&apos; adopted the Bible&apos;s Gospel of Matthew passage &quot;That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly&quot; as a basis for both Dr. Hudson&apos;s generosity and Robert Merrick&apos;s remarkable turnaround as a Nobel Prize-winning brain surgeon. Merrick&apos;s focus on dedicating his life to cure the blind Helen sets up a tearjerker conclusion.\n\nTaylor saw his fortunes in Hollywood increase after &quot;Magnificent Obsession,&quot; a film where the actor was a loan-out to Universal Pictures. He began receiving substantial roles from his employer, MGM, after the studio realized what a gem it had in its stable. Ironically, the 1954 remake of the same book also boasted the career of another young actor who had been bouncing around in low budget adventure movies. Rock Hudson was selected for the Merrick role in director Douglas Sirk&apos;s &quot;Magnificent Obsession.&quot; The film became a huge hit for Universal, catapulting Hudson into the limelight as Hollywood&apos;s new romantic star.",

Thereafter, I probably got used to it and enjoyed this odd and hectic running of events, giftedly performed by catchy character actors - Stellan Skarsgård as Ulrik, above all (he should have been got more awards for this role), as well as all actresses regardless their duration on screen. I had no fits of laughter, but I giggled a lot and shared the feelings of peculiar sorts of people with different age and background. The scenes preceding the very ending could have been with more twists, but nevertheless, this film is recommended to admirers of films where all characters have issues.",

What you can expect though, is a really nice story, some cool one-liners and some pretty funny ideas. One of them being the introduction of the characters. I loved that bit and was bummed when they ditched it in part 2.\n\nIf you can restrict yourself, do not watch the trailer, there is a massive (early) spoiler in there. And one that is really on the nose. Other than that, if you like a good b-movie that is out there (no pun intended), you will love this.

With each player given clues and tools to survive, who will be left? And who is behind this? Not everyone tells the truth, so can the players trust each other to keep themselves civil? You&apos;re going to see review after review comparing this film to &quot;Saw&quot;, and some comparing it to &quot;Battle Royale&quot;... still others referencing lesser known films. And, it&apos;s true, there&apos;s a &quot;Saw&quot; vibe here and a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; vibe... but don&apos;t let that dissuade you. There is nothing new about survival horror and it won&apos;t go away any time soon. And, if done correctly, that&apos;s not a bad thing.\n\nI&apos;ve also seen certain comments concerning the low budget and overabundance of white light. I don&apos;t deny these aspects, but in complete honesty they didn&apos;t bother me one bit. As long as your film has an interesting story -- and this one does -- and isn&apos;t a complete shambles, you have me hook, line and sinker. My only issue with this film was that I had a very strong suspicion of the ending from the very beginning. I was even more convinced after a big clue was dropped in the interview scene.\n\nFans of &quot;Saw&quot; will like this, as will people who like puzzles, so long as they keep an open mind and don&apos;t judge it strictly on its low budget and similarities to other films. I was thoroughly engaged by the interesting characters, destruction of film stereotypes, and ultimately the very clever writing inherent in the picture. Allegedly this film was thrown together roughly overnight, but it doesn&apos;t show.",

      "name": "The problems facing war widows",
      "reviewBody": "This is very much a &apos;film of its time&apos;, but it was designed to be precisely that. It dealt with one of the major social issues of the immediate postwar years, the problems of the grieving young women whose husbands had been killed in the War. The main character in this film is just such a pretty young war widow, played by Janet Leigh. She keeps framed photos of her husband in uniform all round her apartment and beside her bed, and can&apos;t let him go. Her little boy Guy is turned into what she calls &apos;the man of the house&apos;. She cannot come to terms with her loss or make a new life for herself, despite the fact that three or four years have gone by. America was full of women in her condition at this time, women who had been deeply in love with their husbands, lost them in combat, and were then expected to find a new man. Janet Leigh just can&apos;t do that. A boring and &apos;stable&apos; admirer, played by Wendell Corey, has been patiently courting her for two years and keeps telling her that friendship is enough for a marriage and she doesn&apos;t need to love him. She is gradually bringing herself round to accept this kind of a future and even says yes to him at last, convincing herself that it will give her &apos;a quiet life&apos; and a father for her boy (who does not like Corey and keeps insulting him). This film was given a misleading title, because there is no &apos;affair&apos; and the &apos;holiday&apos; refers merely to the fact that it is Christmas time. However, this is not, as some imagine, just &apos;a good Christmas film&apos;. Christmas is merely the convenient background for the story. The story is really about Janet Leigh&apos;s struggle to come to terms with her loss. Through an amusing, if somewhat hectic, series of circumstances, Leigh meets Robert Mitchum. He is working in a New York City department store selling toy trains and she is a &apos;comparison shopper&apos; working for a rival department store. She goes around buying things, taking them to her employer for study, and then returning them and getting a refund. Mitchum discovers this and is about to turn her in, but when he hears she is a war widow with a child, he takes pity on her and lets her go. This is spotted by the floorwalker, and Mitchum is instantly fired. Then a highly complex relationship develops, involving the boy, a train set, various misunderstandings and comic coincidences, and Fate, which obviously had it in mind all along, brings them closer and closer together. This gets up the nose of Corey, who takes it very badly indeed. Little Guy adores Mitchum, and the story is really very ingenious and amusing, as to how things go on from there. I can&apos;t reveal what happens in the end, but you could say Leigh is really on the spot and struggles between boring safety and passionate uncertainty. Mitchum proposes too, and which one will she, can she, choose? This film would have gone straight to the heart for many thousands, probably tens of thousands, of young American widows in her position at that time. As social history it is very important. The film is very sensitively done and must have been a big hit when it came out. It is entertaining to watch, has many amusing moments, and excellent performances.",

      "reviewBody": "First, I&apos;m suspect of those abject stars on here. Both either didn&apos;t watch the movie or are bots.\n\nThe acting is a little above mediocre. The action manages to keep your attention. The effects are pretty decent. Not much to complain about besides the drama tacked on to stretch a runtime and give more screentime to a Korean idol. That created the occasional cringe moment. It doesn&apos;t ruin the plot or story though. Just something American audiences aren&apos;t familiar with so they don&apos;t understand this mugging they do in Korean AAA movies.\n\nThis really needed a big screen viewing to completely grasp the scope of the movie. I felt like I was loosing part of the visuals on television and this movie relies on them.\n\nOverall, an average movie but above average fo Korean Cinema. It&apos;s a popcorn fodder sci-fi beast so that doesn&apos;t matter that much.",

However,times are changing ; unlike the old 1938 couple ,the 1989 characters don&apos;t agree to be victims: Comencini &apos;s work is a comedy,albeit a bitter one,whereas Leo McCarey&apos;s film did not leave any hope to the audience...\n\nMichel Serrault and Virna Lisa are wonderful.",

      "reviewBody": "Forgetting Sarah Marshall - A slacker composer Peter (Jason Segel from &quot;Knocked Up&quot;) has a breakdown after his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell of &quot;Heroes&quot;), the star of a hit TV show, dumps him for a British pop star. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.\n\nThis was a funny movie! It&apos;s a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional &quot;Scrubs&quot; style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.\n\nThis was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that&apos;s a strike against him.\n\nSegel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it&apos;s a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There&apos;s no animosity between the two men. It&apos;s nice to have a comedy where we don&apos;t have to demonize anyone.\n\nIt&apos;s a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.\n\nB+",

After all, it&apos;s only &quot;just a movie&quot; to us--to them, it&apos;s brain surgery at a cost. The cast seems to be having a great time, Alec Baldwin in particular. Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been so benign--and thats a good thing (what a nice change to see him relaxed, romantic and clean-cut). The picture isn&apos;t a barn-burner, it never crackles or builds comedic momentum like, say, &quot;Tootsie&quot;, but it&apos;s a flip, funny, unfettered throwaway. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "Ok, I the first three Police Academy movies were all quite good. I had a vague memory that part 4 is still somehwat good. But when watching it again, I was surprised that most that happens in the movie had been forgotten completely. I mean, the previous films felt very familiar with all the legendary jokes that seem unforgettable. This movie had also some good jokes but...I think it is more forgettable. It starts promising, introducing new interesting characters. But towards the end the plot (if there was much of it in the first place) disappears and the movie becomes quite random.\n\nPros: Harris from the first film is back. He&apos;s a great opposing force, better than Mauser from parts 2-3. This is also the first time Harris and Proctor work together. Harris shouting &quot;Proctor!&quot; is classic. Also nice to see more of Zed. The best new character is Mrs. Feldman, the old lady who has Tackleberry&apos;s attitude.\n\nOverall it&apos;s not a very solid movie but it does have some good comedy moments. Recommended only for fans of the earlier films.",

      "reviewBody": "I found the movie to be funny and cute. I am a fan of Lee Hom. I love the soundtrack in this movie. I am also a big fan of Chinese instruments and it&apos;s awesome that Lee Hom inquired that in his movie. Lee Hom portrayed Chinese instruments in this movie so superbly. Also I&apos;ve never seen this humor side of Lee Hom before too and it&apos;s good to see that. But I have to say that he did add too many fantasy humor moments of him daydreaming away in this movie. I think he went a little over-board on that. Since he portrayed himself as a singer in this movie, he did do a lot of music in this movie (which I love), so I wasn&apos;t sure what I was watching or feeling about this movie. Was it music or really Love in Disguise? In my opinion, the music seems to overpower the movie more than the love relationship between the main characters. Like with the confrontation of the two main characters at the fan signing, I wanted to feel that sadness and pain of watching that part when Lee Hom was sad, but it wasn&apos;t as strong as how I felt about the music. Maybe he should&apos;ve have titled it something else, like &quot;Music to your Soul&quot; or &quot;For the Love of Music&quot; or somewhere along that line. But to title it &quot;Love in Disguise&quot; kind&apos;of made it to what it was but really wasn&apos;t either. In the movie, I would have liked it if he was able to target the relationship between him and the main girl more deeply just as he did with the songs/music in the movie. And not just the two main characters, but also build some story or feelings for the other characters in the movie too would&apos;ve been nice. Well not too much feelings or storyline, but enough to at least know that they too were in the movie instead of looking like extras. If he was able to balance both music and the realtionship with the characters out evenly, I think it would have been great.\n\nOverall the movie was fun to watch. Lee Hom did okay on his first movie he produced and directed. Maybe his next movie will be an improvement. Maybe he will try something new or a different genre. But whatever it is, Lee Hom will do his best.",

Unknown offers the same formula but it still works. This movie caught my attention from the get go. I enjoy how Liam is believable in these roles and you forget that he&apos;s getting up there in age, if anything, he makes it seem like this is what any man his age is capable of. He is awaken from a coma to discover that his identity has been taken by someone else. Worst yet, his wife doesn&apos;t seem to recognize him. With the help of the woman that saved his life, in a country that is not his home, Liam seeks about to prove himself. This movie is action packed and keeps you on the edge while you try to figure out what is going on. And I feel the ending does not disappoint. Enjoyable, entertaining, action packed and thrilling!"

I gave it a shot earlier today and i have to say it was a pretty good movie.\n\nPANDORUM is your classic outer space scifi movie which we really haven&apos;t had for sometime. I do have to say the aliens kind of reminded me of the creatures in the movie DESCENT just with armor. The movie itself had a feel of the original ALIEN movie. Now to what I enjoyed about this movie was the way the story evolved into a edge of your seat thriller with twist after twist. The story is what separates this from other spaceship, scifi movies. Even leaves the viewer thinking &quot;what if&quot; this happens. PANDORUM is a good way to enter this fall season. Great story, good effects, easy story to follow, just enough gore to satisfy everyone and not to much Dennis Quaid to make me happy!",

It&apos;s a reflection of life, with substance, a good script and a great sense humor. It might primary be a story about friendship and lost childhood, but it&apos;s also about time. Everything must change, nothing can be as it is forever.\n\nThe cinematographer and/or camera man have obviously done a more or less perfect work with every scene in the film. Every frame is built on the golden section. I loved it. The black and white photo are also astonishing beautiful in some scenes.\n\nAn enjoyable trip through Germany, delightful for the mind as well as for the eyes. Not for the mainstream movie-goer though.\n\n4/5",

Only this one is worthy of comment, because of the apparent excellence of the demographic engineering.\n\nSo many films suppress the cinematic and narrative experiments in the service of cultural capture. For a student of film it is a trade off because in ordinary film, where the qualities of film are exploited and sometimes extended, we are happy to accept stereotypes, tropes and genre conformity. But when the project is about seduction of identity, the stereotypes are up for experimentation. All else in the media is in support.\n\nIt isn&apos;t just the marvellous creation of this Nancy. I predict this actress will have a rich and much admired career. I thought the same of and early Heath Ledger when I saw him in a King Arthur project with similar goals and values. She not just shines, she understands emotional manipulation.\n\nShe&apos;s what you are supposed to look at. She&apos;s what you are supposed to see, but the heavy engineering has been done around her, in place and gang. Sure, this is Scooby mixed with the old mean girl redemption story. But look closer at how the camera stages groups. Look at the apparently different sets of the same hidden passage.\n\nThere&apos;s craft in this that deserves to be understood. Disney used to have a stable of experts that knew how to do this before the TeeVee production ethic killed it. Maybe we&apos;ll get it back. Because in film, I appreciate experimentation and evolution in any dimension."

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1962, &quot;Escape from Zahrain&quot; is a survival-in-the-desert flick that takes place in the fictitious Arabian country of Zahrain. Yul Brynner plays Sheriff, a righteous Arab revolutionary, while Sal Mineo plays his young disciple who sets him free from captivity and certain death. An Arab nurse (Madlyn Rhue), an embezzling oil worker (Jack Warden) and a mad Arab (Anthony Caruso) are also along for the ride. Can they make it to a bordering nation and freedom or will they all perish in the desert? \n\nAlthough it&apos;s Grade B (and cartoony) in comparison to the way more popular and sophisticated desert film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (also from &apos;62), &quot;Escape to Zahrain&quot; is actually more compelling, which is different than saying it&apos;s better, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s just more immediately satisfying. Two other survival-in-the-desert films that &quot;Zahrain&quot; brings to mind are &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot;, both released in 1965. If you like those two films, you&apos;ll definitely like this one. As great as they are &quot;Zahrain&quot; is as good or better.\n\nThere&apos;s some serious action at the beginning and end of the film, but the heart of the picture is the long trek through the desert and the interplay of the characters. Sheriff (Brynner) and Ahmed (Mineo) have had it with the corrupt officials of Zahrain who rape the land with the technology of the Americans but then greedily keep the cash for their own filthy rich lifestyles; meanwhile the citizenry wallows in poverty and ignorance. The nurse (Madlyn) was educated in Europe and doesn&apos;t understand the reckless passion of the revolutionaries. She&apos;s against them because she&apos;s nursed the wounded &amp; dying followers of Sheriff, mostly youths. The American, Huston (Warden), is viewed as part of the problem by the revolutionaries, but they need him to escape and survive. And then you have the freakin&apos; crazy Arab, Tahar (Caruso), also called &quot;Frankenstein&quot; or &quot;Franky&quot; by Huston. Is he friend or foe, or neither? Also on hand is a pleasant cameo by a major star from that time period, but I don&apos;t want to give it away.\n\nThe film was shot in the Mojave Desert, California, but you&apos;d hardly know as the filmmakers did a great job of giving the illusion that it&apos;s somewhere in the Middle East. My wife, for instance, guessed that it was shot in Egypt.\n\nAt 93 minutes the film doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome.\n\nFINAL WORD: Despite being a serious Grade B picture, &quot;Escape from Zahrain&quot; is Grade A in heart. The film is bookended by quality action sequences, but its core is character-driven. You get to know these characters as they trek through the sweltering desert. Their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and you can&apos;t help but start to care for them, just as they develop a sense of community amongst themselves.\n\nCriminally underrated and unknown, &quot;Escape to Zahrain&quot; ranks with the best desert films, Grade B though it is. It&apos;s also one of Yul&apos;s best and the other principles. No kidding.\n\nGRADE: A-",

      "reviewBody": "Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my expectations and blew me away.\n\nRomance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015.\n\nTherese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine financially... but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who won&apos;t leave her alone and makes her feel miserable.\n\nThese two people meet, and... they connect.\n\nFirst off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body language often speaks for itself. And it&apos;s excellently executed, as you sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it. There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. &quot;Your perfume... it smells good.&quot; is really just a synonym for &quot;I want to kiss you&quot;. &quot;Oh stop it, you look perfect!&quot; can very well mean &quot;I want to spend the rest of my life with you.&quot; The lines are not obvious giveaways and I love it. The audience gets to think for themselves.\n\nBut what really makes this movie work is the acting. It&apos;s absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the husband. You root for the two girls... but you don&apos;t hate Harge either. There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he&apos;s told he can&apos;t have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!\n\nI can&apos;t remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else&apos;s life.\n\nOkay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that couldn&apos;t stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you&apos;ve watched it. Oh and the movie too ;)",

      "description": "In an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&apos;s seminal novel The Price of Salt, &apos;Carol&apos; follows two women from very different backgrounds who find themselves in an unexpected love affair in 1950s New York. As conventional norms of the time challenge their undeniable attraction, an honest story emerges to reveal the resilience of the heart in the face of change. A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.",

A movie everyone should at least watch once. The acting was superb and the story was great. It is a very though provoking movie and very moving. I don&apos;t think it is a stretch to say that this is definitely one of a kind movie. What I am very excited is that this movie ventured to where others never gone to before. Being a fan of both sci-fi and obsessive gay themed movies watcher, this was a gem.\n\nThe movie follows the struggle of a family when faced with possible extinction of humanity as we know it. It will tug at your heart and make you wonder what would you do in the same situation.",

Tim Allen is a natural for the Jason Nesmith role.A great cast is nothing if they don&apos;t work well together.Not to worry.They are superb.

Vamp is worth watching just to see Grace Jones as the tallest, meanest leanest blonde vampire ever! There is no missing the film&apos;s satirical message that female sexuality is a threat to sweet innocent young men and their bonding. The plot is thin (Well, no thinner than a Lethal Weapon story): Two young college kids want to impress their mates by providing the stripper for a college party. This leads them to the &quot;bad&quot; side of town, a scuzzy bar and a thoroughly evil vampire nest (in pure Hollywood style) and of course hilarious consequences. Watanabe is a hoot and the film plays on and with all the traditional stereotypes while maintaining a stiff upper lip over plastic vampire fangs and fake blood. Well worth the time to watch if taken with a sense of humor.",

Despite that this film has a limited number of characters, two to be precise, it is very good and captivating indeed, thanks to some excellent camera work and a semi-Hitchcockian sound track ! Naturally, and even more so with this type of film, it&apos;s the first viewing which leaves the lasting impression ! Now where could that lovely old house have been situated ? ? The picture quality is absolutely excellent and whilst viewing it recently it suddenly seemed to me that the 1960&apos;s were only yesterday and that the forty years that have elapsed since the making of the film had all been condensed into a form of black hole.\n\nFilms using a limited number of characters and a pretty basic plot are a bit of a risk but this one passes the test with flying colours and there are little if any dull moments. Both characters perform excellently and the viewer can sympathize with both, especially at the outset ; only as the film advances does one become aware of the underlying horror and this indeed makes the film far more effective than any old blood-and-gore horror movie.\n\nFirst-time viewings are sure to wear down the edges of most of the viewers&apos; seats ! To be recommended to all those who privilege suspense over special effects !",

If you are 25 or younger it&apos;s a great date movie (because there&apos;s time to make out as the film drags in several spots). It doesn&apos;t twist and turn and the revelations are minimal and far from making the audience gasp. Four out of ten stars may be generous. Good-looking stars and block-busting legends does not a good movie make; much less a great movie. Though I would like to get hold of that ring-tone. Character development was sloppy and dialog was quite pedantic.",

He knows when he wants to do something, and he does it. The guy directed Easy Rider, Hot Spot, Colours and this. If you look these films together, it (his &quot;career&quot;) almost makes some sense in a traditionally logical way. If he would have done only Easy Rider and this, he would be part of the (living) history of art and cinema. And of course now I&apos;m talking about only his directing talent.\n\nBeautiful imagery, wonderful script/dialogue, great directing. Great scenes. Really interesting characters. Great use of music (Elvis, Neil Young,etc). Yeah it&apos;s serious alright, but not in any case too &quot;heavy&quot; to watch. I think everybody or at least anybody should see this movie. It&apos;s beautiful and humane.\n\nSome reviewer said that these people are &quot;white trash&quot;. I&apos;m sorry, but they are not. First, no people are trash, and second: If you live in a big two-story house, in a small town, that don&apos;t make you trash. And both parents in this family go to work. I don&apos;t quite understand the logic; what is the definition of &quot;human trash&quot;? I have understood that the people who live in trailers are often called &quot;white trash&quot;, so is the main criteria living in a trailer? Or is it the level of yearly income?\n\nSome reviewers wrote that this is a portrayal of the &quot;end of the punk-era&quot;. I would say, as the leading girl says in this movie, that &quot;Punk never dies&quot;. It always transforms and represents itself in new forms: The spirit of the eternal rebellion lives forever, because it is a part of being human: It existed before the 60&apos;s/70&apos;s, and nowadays it can be found anywhere else than &quot;punk&quot; scene: In rap music, in art, books, movies, anywhere. You just have to feel it to know it.",

      "reviewBody": "I happened to stumble upon the 2012 horror comedy &quot;Love Bite&quot; by random chance here in 2024. Needless to say that I opted to sit down and watch it, given my love of all things horror. And I have to say that the movie&apos;s synopsis sounded interesting enough.\n\nThe storyline in the movie, however, was somewhat disappointing. There just simply wasn&apos;t enough of anything happening throughout the course of the 91 minutes that the movie ran for. So writers Ronan Blaney and Cris Cole failed to impress me with what they delivered for director Andy De Emmony to bring to the screen. The narrative was simply lacking tremendously in both the horror and comedy department. And there was a bit too much focus on lewd things, as if the narrative was written by a randy adolescent writer.\n\nI wasn&apos;t familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, and that is actually something I do rather enjoy when I sit down to watch a movie. And it should be said that the acting performances in &quot;Love Bite&quot; were actually good.\n\nVisually then &quot;Love Bite&quot; wasn&apos;t all that impressive. Sure, it wasn&apos;t among the worst of special effects movies that I&apos;ve seen, not even remotely. But the CGI animated werewolf in the movie didn&apos;t really look realistic - well, as realistic as a make-believe fantasy creature can get - nor did it look great either. In fact, it looked like something you would find in a late 2000s computer game.\n\nWhile I did manage to sit through the entire 91 minutes that &quot;Love Bite&quot; ran for, this is not an impressive movie. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend for horror comedy fans, because you have to look long and hard to find horror or comedy here. And it is definitely not a movie that I will return to watch a second time.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Love Bite&quot; lands on a very generous four out of ten stars.",

Although it is a re-make of &quot;Death Trap&quot; with Michael Caine and Chris Reeves, that was never mentioned (strange).  There are so many twists, I had to see it twice to understand it.  Sound mixers should refund their pay, since the opening scene cannot be understood because of the loudness of the rain; same is true for other places in the film.  Although it was cut a little too choppily to suit me, I would see it again and found the movie quite intriguing and suspenseful. Too bad we won&apos;t be seeing it in the theatres. Alice Brown"

      "reviewBody": "Evil Aliens tells the story of a group of disreputable news unit who sets out to cover a bizarre story of alien abduction on an isolated island off the coast of Wales.\n\nIf you&apos;re into movies that just don&apos;t let up on incredibly weird scenes, this is the movie for you. You get to see some sick stuff and also some funny stuff, usually combined. You want to see a human having intercourse with an alien? You can see it here. You want to see a violent anal probe? You can see it here.\n\nThis is an independent film by Jake West, a guy who seems to have won countless number of awards for many low-budget films. The movie is handled in quite a professional manner and makes good use of obviously fake CGI. Somehow, he pulls it off so it doesn&apos;t feel so uninvited.\n\nAs the movie progresses, your face will change into many different shapes. Some of the expressions may be... &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;what the hell?&quot; and &quot;ummm, I&apos;m going to look over here... now&quot;. All in good ways. The movies takes so many good ideas (however messed up they may be) to the extreme, they don&apos;t hold back on anything. It&apos;s good to see something refreshingly new to the screen.\n\nCapped off with a stunningly entertaining ending, which is not common with these low-budget films. They usually seem to waste all of their money on the first half of the movie that they run out of money to complete their &quot;great&quot; ending. This is not the case with Evil Aliens as it is the best part of the movie.\n\nOne of the best low-budget films I&apos;ve seen in a long time. Keep an eye and ear out for all of the major film references, you should find some in there. It&apos;s very consistent, and should keep you there for the full 90 minutes.\n\nGood for a laugh with your friends.",

      "reviewBody": "The story behind this film is much more interesting than the movie itself. It seems that production of the film stopped before the final product could be released. According to Wikipedia, the project ran out of money AND some of the investors were being investigated for bank fraud! I have no idea of the outcome of the legal matters, but the movie sat on the shelf for several years. Ultimately, it was sold through an auction and the buyers edited the film themselves...without the film&apos;s director, Alec Baldwin. As a result, Baldwin demanded his name be taken off as director...which seems more than understandable. Then, when the film was ultimately released, it lost money.\n\nThe story is a modern interpretation of the old story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941). However, it also goes by the title &quot;Shortcut to Happiness&quot;.\n\nThe story is about Jabez (Baldwin), a frustrated writer sho has had no success with his work. He&apos;s about to give up when he receives a visit from the Devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt). She offers to make him famous if he sells her his soul...which he does. However, despite huge immediate success, the deal doesn&apos;t make him happy in any way. In fact, in some ways it makes his life worse. So, in desperation, he gets the book agent, Daniel Webster (Anthony Hopkins) to represent him in a court made up of famous dead authors to argue that the deal is null and void.\n\nThe story ISN&apos;T bad. Considering how it was made, it&apos;s actually very surprising it&apos;s even watchable. But there are a few problems. First, the 1941 film is much better. Second, while I am sure Hewitt is a lovely person, she seemed all wrong for her role. Third, the film is just flat...watchable but flat.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Island of the Bloody Plantation&quot; is set on a small, unnamed island (probably somewhere in the Philippines), where a Nazi-like dictator runs a prison-like plantation: the local girls work all day as slaves, supervised (and often sexually attacked) by a few (fairly inept) white guards, some local guys and a couple of midgets (!). One of the guards, played by Udo Kier, falls in love with one of the girls and decides to help all of them escape from the island.\n\nI was rather surprised to find this movie on DVD. Presented in a startlingly clear print, it looks beautifully shot, with an often stunning cinematography. This beauty clashes, however, with the dubbing and the low-grade material. The story is simple and unexciting, and frequently ceases to make sense! An example: at one point, one of the girls helps Kier and his girlfriend with the use of some magical powers. Why couldn&apos;t she have used them earlier? Why doesn&apos;t she use them again? At the end (SPOILERS FOLLOW) the girls escape in what must be one of the easiest escapes ever in the history of WIP movies. Udo Kier takes the film seriously and tries to act, but he is hampered (in the Eglish-language print) by being dubbed with a rather girlish voice. (**)",

      "reviewBody": "A young man (Patrick Bauchau) parts with his fiancée to vacation in the south of France, where he plans to catch up with an old friend and spend his time in solitude. His holiday idyll is perturbed by the presence of a young woman (Haydée Politoff), who he says is not his type, but spends an awful lot of his time thinking about. She&apos;s sexually free and while in search of what she&apos;s looking for in life, sleeps with various men, a fact that gets under his skin.\n\nThe film is appealing aesthetically because through various small observational details in the surroundings and in the introspective silences he allows in, Éric Rohmer transports us to this place and its feeling. Politoff is also appealing to say the least, and her character has such an innocent simplicity about her that she&apos;s charming to watch. These are the things that made the film for me.\n\nWhat I disliked about it was the protagonist, who provides the narration and the point of view of the film. While Rohmer is making a point about male insecurity and this guy&apos;s issues (as well as the other guy there, who&apos;s also an idiot), I have to say, he&apos;s so cold and judgmental that he&apos;s not likeable. I would have loved a version of this film that was made from Haydée&apos;s perspective. To its credit, through dialogue she is allowed to express her opinions, e.g. That he should mind his own business, and her boredom as he prattles on with his tedious pseudo-intellectualism. The art dealer also provides quite a takedown of the young man&apos;s not working and general laziness. He seems empty as a person and I suppose we&apos;re meant to recognize that and compare it to Haydée, who presumably goes off to Italy at the end and gets more enjoyment out of life. It&apos;s just unfortunate that the film, through its title and its narration, seems to share some of the viewpoint of the young man.\n\nOverall, however, I liked this film both times I&apos;ve watched it, and thought it was wisely kept at just 83 minutes. It makes me feel as though I was on holiday, and the images of Haydée Politoff are indelible.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s most unfortunate that all the smaller-scaled psychological thrillers Hammer produced during the mid 60&apos;s remain somewhat in the shadows of their more grotesque and Grand Guignol featuring horror &amp; Sci-Fi productions (like the Dracula and Frankenstein franchises or the Quatermass trilogy), because there are quite a few of genuine treasures to discover! &quot;Fanatic&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Die! Die! My Darling&quot; is such a wondrous example of an original and highly atmospheric but sadly underrated Hammer thriller. Richard Matheson&apos;s screenplay  adapted from a novel by Anne Blaisdell  is terrifically tight &amp; uncomfortably credible, the atmosphere is uncanny throughout and Tallulah Bankhead&apos;s performance as the insane religious freak truly stands as one of the greatest in the history of horror cinema. Whilst visiting England with her new lover, all-American girl Pat Carroll plans to pay a visit to Mrs. Trefoile; the mother of her ex-fiancée who died in a car accident before they ever had the chance of getting married. Mrs. Trefoile acts a bit whiny and exaggeratedly religious at first, but still fairly harmless since the visit is meant to be brief and formal. However, Mrs. Trefoile turns into a totally religion-obsessed fruitcake when she learns Pat isn&apos;t a virgin anymore and never actually intended to marry her son in the first place! She gets more fanatic than Jesus himself and locks Pat away in the secluded mansion&apos;s attic with the intention to cleanse her soul and prepare her to reunite with the son in the afterlife. The concept of this film is simply stupendous, if you ask me, and veteran writer Richard Matheson makes sure that every tiniest possible detail in the script gets covered. There are also some very intriguing sub plots, like the awkward relationships between Mrs. Trefoile&apos;s servants and the gradual unfolding of what exactly happened between Pat and Mrs. Trefoile departed son. There are a few clearly noticeable similarities between this film and Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, which leads to some obvious twists and a fairly predictable finale. But then again, you can&apos;t blame the film for this since pretty much every horror movie made after 1960 is influenced by &quot;Psycho&quot; in one way or another. Tallulah (I even love typing her name) Bankhead obviously steals the show in every scene she&apos;s in, but the rest of fine cast deserves a word of respect as well, including a young Donald Sutherland as the mentally disabled gardener. Next time you set up a list of favorite Hammer films, make sure you watch &quot;Fanatic&quot; first and I guarantee it will be in there somewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Kambakkht Ishq&apos; has been in the buzz for a long,long time. The film has been awaited... why? Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor are the lead actors, the film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala and has 3 Hollywood Supertstars, Stallone, Routh and Denise Richards. But with all these trumps does this flick entertain? The answer is NO!\n\nThe problem with Kambakkht Ishq is that it&apos;s a senseless film. The film hardly has a script, Debutant Director Sabbir Khan makes a disappointing fare. The first hr of the film is yet passable, but the second is just unbearable. The film has &apos;A&apos; class production value, but script wise, its a complete disappointment.\n\nPluses of the film: Sajid Nadiadwala is a classy producer, he has left no stone unturned to make this flick. Akshay, Kareena, Stallone, Routh &amp; Denise Richards are the pluses as well. Akshay is in form once again, but he&apos;s again done a film that throws even the least amount of logic into the trash bin. Kareena looks great and delivers a good performance. Stallone, Routh, Denise are perfect in cameos. Stallone&apos;s action scene, where he bashes up the goons will be will loved by one and all. Aftab &amp; Amrita do their parts perfectly. Vindhu Singh is just right.\n\nMinuses: Sabbir Khan&apos;s direction and screenplay. Anu Malik&apos;s music is mediocre. Talented actors like Kirron Khan and Jaaved Jaffery are wasted in apologetic roles. \n\nThose 5 stars are in order -- 1 for Sajid Nadiadwala&apos;s high class production, 1 for Akki, 1 for Kareena, 1 for Stallone, and 1 is shared by Denise and Routh. \n\nTo sum up the review, &apos;Kambakkht Ishq&apos; is a letdown.",

It&apos;s fast paced and there is always something happening. I really was not bored at all during any part of the movie. There are many things I can criticize about this movie, and I can understand the points other posters have made, but the bottom line is that it&apos;s just a movie. It&apos;s how I passed a couple of hours this Sunday night and that&apos;s all. When I want real excitement all I have to do is open the paper and read about all the crazy things happening in the world.

      "reviewBody": "Somerset Maugham once made this observation about poverty: &quot;You will hear people say that poverty is the best spur to the artist. They have never felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your soul like a cancer.&quot;\n\nThe spirit of what he said pervades this disturbing film. No doubt this work would have to resonate more in Britain, but even 50-years later, unemployment, abandonment of the elderly, and welfare subsistence are fairly universal maladies of the Western World.\n\n&quot;The Whisperers&quot; is not a comfortable experience. A disturbed old woman, Mrs Ross (Edith Evans), who lives alone is slowly losing her grip on reality, she lives in impoverished circumstances and is dependent on welfare. When she accidentally comes into a little money, she is preyed on like a wounded animal in the jungle. Even her son, Charlie (Ronald Fraser), and her estranged husband, Archie (Eric Portman), take advantage of her.\n\nThis is more than a performance by Edith Evans; when it&apos;s over, you believe Mrs Ross existed.\n\nShe lives in a society where ruthless opportunists abound. However, the story is not devoid of decent people; her young neighbour and especially the understanding Mr Conrad (Gerald Sim) at the welfare office redeem what would be a very jaundiced look at modern life.\n\nBryan Forbes was a man of many talents: actor, writer and director, but this film would have to be at the pinnacle of his achievements. The film boasts brilliant photography and real locations. You can almost smell the rising damp and cheap tobacco, and feel the mud spattered on your shoes - not to mention the edge of the cut-throat razors in one disturbing scene; powerful imagery in the impressive tradition of British &apos;kitchen sink dramas&apos;.\n\nThe film has a score by John Barry. Although I didn&apos;t see this film until 50 years after it was made, I knew the theme far earlier from a Barry compilation album, and always wanted to see the film it went with. This was before Barry settled into that languid style when many of his scores seemed interchangeable. During the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s he was one of the most experimental composers. He used a harpsichord here in a small-scale work, which suited the poignancy and bleakness of the story.\n\nAlthough dramatised, the film shows a slice of modern life, but from a rather dispassionate point-of-view and that makes it hit home all the more.",

Another good story-line, where a meteor is on its course to Earth and is predicted to destroy the entire planet completely. Therefore, it&apos;s up to the Japanese eggheads to dodge the flying fireball. As always, Toho sci-fi films are very imaginative, but this one takes the cake: move the Earth with huge rockets to dodge the meteor, with the Moon being destroyed in the process. Very far-fetched, but yet, pure sci-fi action.\n\nVeteran actresses Kumi Mizuno and Yumi Shirakawa shine. Akira Kubo, known for his type-casted hero portrayals, is very annoying in this film though. Aside from that, an average film that could have used more monster scenes and action, instead of the usual scientist concoctions to save the world. I have got to say that even though Takeshi Kimura, known for his more somber stories, wrote the screenplay, there are a few funny scenes, including the part where Shirakawa&apos;s character bangs the door on her brother&apos;s head after he was caught eavesdropping on a meeting with the lead scientist. \n\nIf you choose to watch this film, I recommend watching the original Japanese version, as the American version cuts out scenes that include Magma, the gigantic walrus. \n\nGrade C+",

I always felt he had a bright future ahead of him,as talented as the man is.I very much looked forward to the man&apos;s film career beginning, but sadly,at least for me anyway,his big screen efforts have left a lot to be desired.Most of Carrey&apos;s films have been ridden with oversexed dialog and toilet humor.Finally,a much more toned down Carrey gives me something to smile about.His efforts in The Majestic are simply amazing. The slapstick humor is put aside,very delicately,and what we have is a very appealing fictional story,with Carrey making an excellent romantic and dramatic lead.If you go into the watching of this film looking for the outrageous hairdo of Ace Ventura,the hideous green mask,or anything of the like from his previous films,this will be a big disappointment to you,but if you go into it with an open mind about what he can accomplish dramatically,you will be most pleased.Things are looking up for Jim Carrey.Also,Martin Landau is great as always in a supporting role.Thumbs up!"

On the other hand, it can be taken as a very accessible commentary on friendship, companionship and finding the joy in life. I prefer the latter. Either way, it does require a certain suspension of reality. Just ask Roger Ebert, who has made it his personal mission to bash the film.\n\nJack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both in prime form, and after a string of weak films, director Rob Reiner does a masterful job of keeping Nicholson from going over the top and from having Freeman kill us with sweetness. Even more impressive is the pacing of the early hospital scenes ... nothing is forced, no line of dialogue or shot seems hurried. This is two patients coming to grips with their situation. While the worldly travels are impressive, my favorite parts of the film are the scenes between the two beds in the same room.\n\nOn the downside, will someone please tell Hollywood that Morgan Freeman in the cast does not mandate a blasted voice-over from the man? We know he has a great voice, but if the narration adds nothing to the story, please just let the film do its thing.\n\nThere are some laugh out loud moments and one-liners, but there are also some strong moments of drama ... death has a way of creating those. This is a combination of road trip, buddy film and coming-of-age ... very unusual for two senior citizens! So while the story line surprises are few, sit back and enjoy excellent acting (including Sean Hayes), wonderful direction and a few life lessons. Good stuff for a movie that all ages can enjoy.",

This movie was the complete opposite, I think it was the first movie I&apos;ve seen in a long time that had a point and was not mindless or boring.\n\nI&apos;m a fourteen year old and the movie was great, it was very relatable even though I haven&apos;t been through any sexual abuse. \n\nIf a movie can relate to me so deeply even though I didn&apos;t grow up in that time period, grew up in New York City, and did not go through some of the things she went through then I really think it&apos;s an excellent movie.\n\nThe content was not disturbing to me at all in a sense most people say. I think most people who say it&apos;s disturbing haven&apos;t seen the movie because yes, it is very real and true but not gross. I think it&apos;s great the director/writer touched on the subject of sexual abuse in such a great way because that subject is not brought up often in our society but it&apos;s something that is happening.\n\nI was not sure of seeing this movie-not because of the rape scene because I knew people were making such a big deal of it but because of the other comments about how the movie wasn&apos;t going anywhere or was pointless. But I was so surprised that they were so wrong and that for me and from what I could see in the audience it was the complete opposite of pointless.\n\nBottom line if you haven&apos;t seen the movie already and aren&apos;t sure if you ant to go and see it, go and see it. I wasn&apos;t sure if I should see this movie either but it turned out to be one of the best movies I&apos;ve seen in a long time with great writing, directing, and acting. Very real but not gross or disturbing and a story that needed to be told.",

This WAS Vincent Price&apos;s finest screen moment and I recall clearly at the time, one particular UK critic who suggested &quot;This brilliant film will probably require a generation before it can ever be held in the esteem to which it is entitled!&quot;\n\nWay too literate for mainstream horror fans&apos; taste - it was so much more. Few had the theatrical flourish of Vincent Price and he was just so perfectly cast as the acting-legend-in-his-own-mind disfavored by a cross section of critics that may otherwise have steered his career on to the rocks. Taking &quot;tragedy&quot; to a new level, he REALLY silencies his critics once and for all, taking them out one by one in escalatingly appropriate Shakespearean circumstances.\n\nBlack black dialog with the Bard&apos;s turn of a phrase pervades the entire film. Yeah its gory - so&apos;s Macbeth! It is also one of the greatest horror comedies ever devised, with A-List acting credits.\n\nQuite simply, NOT to be missed!"

The movie is suppose to be based on true events. But what the hell where those events. The story telling is so fragmented and ambiguous, and perhaps would have been better told in say 22 minutes ala Twilight Zone, but the plot is so stretched that the filler dilutes whatever message the movie makers wanted to make. I waited until the last minute to see if this movie would &quot;save&quot; itself, yet alas no. I only sacrificed 90 minutes of time to trite. Oh, and the music, the score, or whatever it was, was just awful. In fact, the music used during the opening credits should have tipped me off to the crap that lied ahead.",

The soundtrack is excellent (this coming from someone who  doesn&apos;t really like techno, club, rap, or hip-hop music), and I would  definitely buy this movie to watch again. It may not be for everyone,  but the cast is first-rate; the story line believable, and seeing  Samuel L. Jackson in a kilt couldn&apos;t be beat! I give this movie a 9 out  of 10.

Broderick and DeVito are certainly good in their roles. But the script could have been much better, sometimes i wonder if the movie was meant to be darker at times. Perphas the dirtiest joke in the movie, when Broderick and DeVito are amused (and probably turned-on) by watching live performance of &quot;Santa Baby&quot;, not realized in these short Christmas skirts and Christmas costumes is their daughters. But the worst thing about the movie is the Christmas lights, especially in DeVito&apos;s home in the picture. After watching the movie, it kinda made me sick watching these different colors Christmas lights. Overall, &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; is fairly amusing two-thirds of the way but the movie always goes overkill. Too bad with a brighter script, this feature could have been really good. Watchable but nothing memorable. (***/*****).",

This is film noir made even more noir by the drab sets and lighting. We go through the terrifying experience of a man who is trying to escape from the monster he has placed on his own back.\n\nElmer Bernstein&apos;s score is a mixture of jazz and symphony that makes the addict&apos;s frightful journey even more believable to the audience.\n\nThis film opened the topic of drug addiction the way LOST WEEKEND broached the subject of alcoholism. At least people could talk about these addictions a little more freely."

Whether it was intended to be original or not, I&apos;m not sure, but with a few less clichés and a bit more character development, this could have been a film like May, smart and scary, and eccentric. Perhaps this film is a &apos;takes one to know one&apos; kind of story. socially troubled girls, may find this emotional but everyone else will see Tamara as what it is, a sexy, but shallow horror movie. \n\nTamara Riley becomes the most hated girl in school after she writes a news paper article which rats out a number of her school mates in a certain way. One night, a bunch of them play a nasty prank on her, but things go wrong and she is accidentally killed. In the panic, they bury her body in the woods, but somehow she comes back from the dead, more cunning and sexy than before, and with a mind for revenge.\n\nThe trick to enjoying the movie is whether or not you feel engaged enough to root for the protagonist. She was done a major injustice but she is also doing injustice to others. The sex appeal of Tamara is really secondary. Tamara is nothing more or less than amusing in a twisted way, but if you want a similar movie that actually gets you thinking, watch May.",

      "reviewBody": "In recent years this porn video has virtually blanketed adult video stores with posters promoting it, and I&apos;m sure it was a huge sales hit. With a cross section of beautiful XXX stars it delivers the goods and then some.\n\nI&apos;ve been watching a lot of 1970s classic (and not so memorable) porn movies on DVD of late, and the party line is that they were the Golden Age of story lines, and now it&apos;s all drivel. BABYSITTERS essentially puts the lie to that blanket cliché -it&apos;s designed in an all-sex format but has plenty of story setup material and much better acting than the average oldie.\n\nWith cartoon panel style transitions, the episodic structure limns the adventures of several babysitters, acting out fantasies in realistic settings. Video is bookended by segments involving Jesse Jane, probably the top-draw in the cast and quite fetching with pigtails as the jail-bait babysitter.\n\nBoth acting-wise and in terms of sexiness she is outshone by Nautica Thorn, scrumptious with glasses on, and fairly irresistible to a hard-to-please British-accented employer. Her natural bust is certainly a treat. Also all-natural is Sasha Grey, who more recently has advanced to the head of the class in popularity among porn starlets. She gets the gonzo assignment, servicing four studs at a birthday celebration for one of them.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about BABYSITTERS is that it successfully straddled two genres, the popular MILF video as well as its underage-baiting premise title niche. Among the naughty housewives Nikki Benz (teamed with Jane in a good contrast) and Gina Lynn (opposite Shay Jordan) were literal standouts. A rather labored sequence of four silicone mamas getting the rough treatment by Sophia Santi (employing a strap-on and endless dildos) missed the mark for me, but certainly had fetishists in mind with its lesbian/anal emphasis.\n\nHi-def lensing by the director Robby D was well executed, and an upbeat musical score cemented this romp as a winner. I would love to find out the financial stats on such an enterprise; I guesstimate it was made on a substantial budget and undoubtedly grossed in seven figures from video sales over the past three years, with a big-ticket list price compared to the thousands of throwaway videos stocked nearby."

Captured and put on film to remind the viewer what good flamenco can be like.\n\nIt&apos;s flamenco for the modern age, yet, the costumes and the voices are old, old.\n\nThis film has well known artists, and it also introduces us to the up and coming singers, guitarists, and dancers.\n\nI highly recommend this film to all fans of the art of flamenco.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie unfolds slowly &amp; tentatively, but picks up speed as it progresses...or maybe I was just too concerned with Steve Martin&apos;s interpretation of Inspector Clouseau, and I finally relaxed about halfway through the film. Well, when you&apos;re used to seeing Peter Sellers as Clouseau, it&apos;s just difficult to view anyone else in that role. But, true to the character, Steve Martin does make it his own, and actually pulls it off pretty effectively. He has always been good with physical humor, and this film is no exception.\n\nSimilarly, its difficult to adjust to seeing Kevin Kline as Inspector Dreyfus. Since this movie is a prequel, I can assume that Clouseau has yet to get completely under his skin. It was typical Kevin Kline ... dry, with a weak french accent. I was mildly disappointed because I really enjoyed his french character &amp; accent in French Kiss several years ago.\n\nThe first few gags were very short-sided and fell flat, but once Clouseau starts looking for clues the slapstick works a little better &amp; the film gets more enjoyable. Many of the gags are predictable (as is the plot), but what really makes them work is Martin&apos;s reactions (which I really think was the key to Peter Seller&apos;s portrayal as well).\n\nThis film was very tame, with only subtle innuendoes that most youngsters aren&apos;t likely to grasp. The audience appeared to laugh at least as much as I did. If you don&apos;t expect too much, this movie will be fun; if you expect too much, you&apos;re likely to be disappointed.",

She does a lot of karate and steals the show as much as Brosnan.\n\nElliot Carver, played by Jonathan Pryce, is a pretty decent villain. He is nowhere near as intimidating as some of the best Bond villains, but he is certainly passable. His goals were a little more realistic than most Bond villains. His henchmen is just another Red Grant clone.\n\nThe story, while not the deepest, has a lot of intriguing elements with Carver writing disasters in his newspaper and making them happen. The media angles makes a lot of sense these days. The locations work, especially Thailand.\n\nThis film is up there with &quot;Moonraker&quot; as one of the most relentlessly action-packed entries in the series. We get a spectacular opening sequence, a chase in a parking garage with Bond using his remote-control BMW, a wicked motorcycle chase, and so much more.\n\nThis is a very solid if slightly by-the-numbers entry in the series. There is rarely a dull moment, and there is enough action for several movies. Another fun Bond film.\n\nRATING: B",

It teach us how a dog is a true fighter and the unconditional love for their owners and her own puppies, If you like or love dogs you would not be disappointment watching this movie,after all is a true story. Personally I cried with this movie and make me realize how amazing are animals, they give us much more of what we give them in return. Finally to say that A Tale of Mari and Three Puppies is a lovely and inspiring story. Japanesse movies always leave a positive message( Hachiko, 1 litre of tears,etc)",

Franjinha&apos;s laboratory is invaded by Cebolinha and Cascão, who are running away from Mônica, followed by Magali. In the confusion, Sansão is thrown towards the boys and hits the time machine. The impact makes the four elements go to different times, each one in the same place in Brazil, the Limoeiro neighborhood - where the girls and boys live. The accident causes a disaster - time starts to slow down on Earth. To reverse this situation, the four need to embark on different times and rescue the elements.\n\nI&apos;m super biased because I really love Turma da Mônica, it has a super nostalgic aura, as if it came straight out of the comics I read in the 90s and bought at newsstands... It was interesting to use several characters that already existed in the gang in various timeless periods, a delightful and captivating experience... So cute and exciting, the bunny part, and full of adventures and a super cute and necessary inclusion at the end...",

The story is set in ancient Japan, where a young boy named Kubo cares for his ailing mother in a seaside Japanese village. He is a beloved storyteller who plays a magical shamisen (Japanese 3-string instrument). A spirit from the past turns Kubo&apos;s life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. In order to survive, he sets out on a quest to locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior. He makes friends and allies, encounters monsters and evil demons, and learns important lessons along the way. Visually, this is epically incredible and a game changer for stop motion. The action and excitement kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for really small children, though. There are times it&apos;s scary and the monsters are very well done! There&apos;s an excellent moral to the story and delightful humor, so children and adults will both enjoy it. Well done Laika. Best one yet!",

      "reviewBody": "It starts in Córdoba 1808 , when the French troops , the Grand Armee , have invaded Spain to pass towards Portugal. An Army heads for Andujar to join General Dupont and conquer Bailen, where will take place a famous battle . In a village called Montoro -Arcos de la Frontera- the citizens join to a brave purport : an upheaval against the invader troops commanded by French Colonel Demartie : Rafael Duran and his officers Jose Luis Pellicena and Jack Taylor. Meanwhile, they are received by the innkeeper La Salvadora : Rocio Jurado who&apos;s planned along with the rebels led by Jose Manuel : Manolo Escobar a scheme to execute a sudden rebellion to detain them . As while a bullfighting spectacle and a charming dancing show the villagers uprising against the undesirable visitors .\n\nEntertaining and sunny adventure/musical movie with historical background , starring the two greatest singers by the time . The main attractive of this decent movie results to be the debut of these two popular singers , as Manolo Escobar who sings six songs -including the famous Poronpomperoporon- and Rocio Jurado, &quot;La Más Grande&quot; singing four songs .Although Manolo Escobar developed a long cinematic career and Rocio Jurado will only play five films . They are well accompanied by a good cast with plenty of familiar faces , such as : Jose Luis Pellicena , Paula Martel, Rafael Duran , Jack Taylor , Jose Moreno , Lina Yegros , Alfredo Mayo and the always sympathetic Manolo Gómez Bur and Gracita Morales .\n\nSpecial mention for brilliant and glimmer ciematography by Alfredo Fraile -producer as well- shot on location in Arcos de la Frontera and including gorgeous landscapes . As well as evocative musical score by Juan Solano, adding popular and catching songs from the known singers . Lavishly produced by Alfredo Fraile and Cesáreo González, being professionally directed by Pedro L Ramírez. This fine filmmaker had an uneven career , being made in his best period when he directed successful comedies as &quot;Recluta con Niño, Ladrones Somos Gente Honrada , El Tigre de Chamberi , Fantasmas en la Casa , El Gafe , La Cenicienta y Ernesto , Crimen para Recién Casados , ? Donde Pongo Este Muerto?&quot; . Although Pedro L Ramírez also directed other genres as Paella Westerns : &quot;Judas Toma Tus Monedas , Clint El Solitario , Ninguno de los Tres llamaba Trinidad&quot; and Giallo and terror as &quot;El Pez de los Ojos de Oro , El Colegio de la Muerte&quot; .",

      "reviewBody": "As the titel says, this movie is great, but only if you like Pokémon. If you are a long time Pokémon fan you will love this movie, but if you don&apos;t like Pokémon, if Pokémon doesn&apos;t really interest you or the small chance that you&apos;ve never heard about it, most of the movie will not be very interesting. There&apos;s a lot of inside jokes and the likes. I&apos;m not saying you need large amount of Pokémon knowledge to watch this movie, but if you need to google Mewtwo or Psyduck to know what they are, then this movie is most likely not for you.\n\nOkay, enough about that. This movie is the best game adaptation I&apos;ve seen to date. It&apos;s funny, the visual effects are amazing and it has heart when it wants to. There is something for all ages. Pikachu is adorable and Ryan Reynolds is really great. The human actors are unfortunately this movies weak point. Justice Smith is good and Bill Nighy is Bill Nighy, but the rest are not great and mostly not believable (they&apos;re not terrible though), fortunately they don&apos;t get that much screentime. The plot is good, but a bit predictable (gets a little wierd in the end).\n\nJust to clear up my thoughts, Ryan Reynolds and the Pokémons really makes this movie for me. For me it&apos;s an 8 out of 10.\n\nHope this helps any potential moviegoer.",

The show was about a world where everything that humans discard winds up. Debbie, a girl transported to this world, would explain to the denizens of Tattertown their worth separated from the human world. The pilot dealt with Christmas, albeit not very well, and was reconfigured as a special to be aired on November 21st 1988. There&apos;s a reason why you&apos;ve never heard it. It ain&apos;t that good.\n\nNarrated by Keith David, and featuring typically eccentric Bakshi animation, I can see that the concept would have been full of potential, but the characters are all over the place, and the Angelika-like antagonist (all you Rugrats fans will get what I mean) was very, very annoying.\n\nWorth watching as a curiosity.",

      "reviewBody": "Besides updating the 19th-century story to the then-modern day and transporting it from Saint Petersburg to France and reordering some of the narrative, this film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&apos;s novel &quot;Crime and Punishment,&quot; and despite its noir style and sensibilities, it&apos;s a lackluster one, too. I&apos;ve reviewed 24 movies inspired by the book since reading it, and this one ranks somewhere in the middle.\n\nI like that the Raskolnikov type here, renamed &quot;René,&quot; works with his friend to earn money by translating murder mysteries, which are the literary origins of film noir, after all. Combining two of his sister&apos;s suitors into one character helps make the adaptation more concise, too. I&apos;m less fond that the male characters dominate most of the picture--even sidelining the Sonya type, &quot;Lily,&quot; for much of it. Delaying the murder scene and other reorganizing of the plot also seems to confuse the rationale for the crime. René confesses to Lily that he no longer even knows why--poverty, his sister surrendering herself to a vile older man for his money, his aspirations to be an extraordinary man like Napoleon; at this point, the spectator, too, should be forgiven for being confused as to his reasons.\n\nMinor changes, such as switching out the axe for a knife as the murder weapon or the drunkard falling from a staircase to his death instead of being run over by a horse, don&apos;t bother me. That it doesn&apos;t offer any compelling cinematic transmutation for the novel&apos;s ability to enter characters&apos; minds--reading their thoughts and dreams--is disappointing, though. Other versions have done better in this regard. And, yes, as far as straightforward, studio adaptations, the 1935 French version is one of the better acted, paced and photographed. This one, too, has some decent studio sets, there&apos;s a nice contrast between the picture of Napoleon in René&apos;s room and that of the crucifixion of Christ in Lily&apos;s, and the picture is often appropriately dark and shadowy, but I was hoping for more bite from a noir. Some business involving automatons doesn&apos;t do the trick. For a film noir reworking of the book, I prefer &quot;Fear&quot; (1946), which is an admittedly bonkers B-picture, but it imitates other crime pictures better and manages to do so in ways that offer a novel twist on Dostoevsky&apos;s prose.",

      "reviewBody": "As a movie buff, I tend to gravitate toward the art &amp; independent material but also due to my area&apos;s theater selections, see a fair amount of mainstream movies. Yes, I catch few good films but many times I find disappointment in both worlds. This time ended differently. I can&apos;t help but remark how impressed I was by the honest writing and acting of all three characters. Struck me as rather genuine, gritty and believable plot-wise. I also was unsure if I appreciated the decision to refrain from thoroughly fleshing-out every character. One has staggering levels in which they are left to guess about all three. Ie: What happened to Stewart&apos;s character other than her mom&apos;s accident and demise to lead her on such a disheartening path? Why not more information and insight as to chronicle the downward spiral of this marriage after the child&apos;s death? Why not dig into and explore the wife&apos;s inward turn to near-hermit? Why is the husband not only so disenchanted with home but also work, albeit this desperate &amp; hopeless soul floundering about? Well, actually wise decision to leave this unknown; I see it&apos;s not all that critical to the success of the story. Writers today over-inform. \n\nAnother area I originally thought to be a caveat to success was ending as it did. I mean everyone likes and cheers for a happy ending. But pondering this further--really how realistic is this in life? Moreover (and I&apos;ve worked with troubled and lost kids) this film plays out precisely how life goes. It&apos;s not simple to intervene and turn someone around late in the game. There is wisdom, perception and integrity in this attempt to depict a more genuine article of life and that was done. I think Stewart&apos;s work was exceptional and her remark that she&apos;s &quot;no one&apos;s little girl&quot; (something to that affect) captures it brilliantly. You see throughout her vulnerability, survival instinct, yet damaged nature without her acting being sentimental or &quot;hollywood&quot;. Yes, nice little gem.",

      "reviewBody": "Caught this today on DVD with a buddy&apos;s grand-kids, and was pleasantly surprised. I have given it 9 out of 10, not for pure artistic merit, but as a funny &apos;family-film&apos;. Certainly, the current rating here at IMDb is pessimistic. There are only 2 or 3 decent films of this sort produced annually in Hollywood, the rest being utter trash.\n\nEddie Murphy plays a more subdued role than we might expect as a high-powered &apos;player&apos; in the ad game, with little time for his family. A sudden change finds him desperate for work or an enterprise, in a plot ploy reminiscent of Michael Keaton&apos;s &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;. The unfolding action finds Eddie scrambling to operate a day care facility with frenetic partners Jeff Garlin and, later, Steve Zahn. Murphy allows that duo to handle the slapstick end of things. He remains the thinker and the one who calms the waves of lunacy, allowing the plot to move forward to the next challenge facing our heroes.\n\nThe satirical side of this story is shown by examining the competing (snotty) daycare center of the always-delightful Angelica Huston, reprising her &apos;vampy villainess&apos; role of &quot;Ever After&quot;. She runs a sophisticated academy for toddlers that Fraser and Niles Crane might envy (but it really needs to be taken down a peg or two).\n\nRefreshing, too, is the portrayal of the daycare inspector unleashed on Eddie by Huston. Instead of the typical clichéd grump who threatens and hollers, we get a tender, supportive fella who really wants the boys to succeed (we find out why at the end - watch the puppet show carefully!).\n\nGarlin is the closest thing I&apos;ve seen to a replacement for our departed and dear John Candy, a slightly over-sized actor who can combine tenderness with slapstick! Zahn was an unusual sidekick fit as &apos;Giordino&apos; to McConaughey&apos;s &apos;Dirk Pitt&apos; in &quot;Sahara&quot;, and, here as a hapless Trekkie, impresses with his comedic timing.\n\nOther notables pop up in supporting roles, and the kids are terrific. Enjoy! \n\nFinal word to other actors of (former) glory: check your ego at the door, share the limelight with a great supporting cast and find a real script with likable or compelling characters. in no particular order.",

      "reviewBody": "This film ultimately fails as an historical drama. It has some pretty good elements. The production values of the costumes, scenes, etc., are overall quite good. Guinness is great as Charles: he looks a lot like him, and he does a good job at conveying the king&apos;s tyrannical, autocratic stance, his conviction in his belief that he&apos;s right, his nobility to the end, and the fact that while he usually ended up taking bad positions or doing the wrong things, he did so not entirely for bad reasons (at least in his own mind), for he was sure that he was right. The film also makes some modicum of effort at showing Cromwell&apos;s more troubling qualities, too, making him out to be the noble hero, but not entirely covering up his transformation into ruthless, hypocritical dictator.\n\nHowever, the film has equally strong bad points. It tends to drag at many points and frequently gives the impression of being an overly drawn-out stage production that fails to be fully convincing. More serious, though, is the problem that, although presenting itself as historical, it plays fast and loose with history. It does not fully explain the causes of the Civil War or the differences of viewpoints within each side, especially the Parliamentarians, not all of whom were fighting for the same reasons. It portrays the Royalist forces as the flashy, well-equipped and stronger element when in reality the Parliament forces were not only much more numerous, but usually much better equipped as well (after all, it was not a war of rag-tag, grass-roots rebels trying to topple the government; each side represented in part one branch of the government and Parliament, not the king, was the body that held the purse strings). In addition, the Royalists often did quite well in battle despite their inferior forces. It clearly makes Cromwell out to be too important from the start: rather than being one of the key leaders in the beginning, he really started out as a military commander and simply rose to prominence over time. Finally, Cromwell, despite some of his autocratic tendency coming through, is still shown to be too much the reluctant, noble hero, and the film only hints at his other face, one which in short order made him none too popular in England, let alone Ireland. Needless to say, nothing is mentioned of his willingness to shed the blood of Royalists and Catholics, or to destroy historic architecture that conflicted with his Puritan views.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Billy Wilder&apos;s best films and still stands up very well today. Unlike the concentration camps of the Holocaust, prison camps for Allied prisoners were actually not all that bad in comparison (except for how the Russian prisoners were treated--they were often just shot). So, the prisoners enjoyed a little more freedom and were constantly trying to deal with the incredible boredom of being locked up with very little to do. As a result, films about these camps (such as this one and THE GREAT ESCAPE) are few and far between--they would just be too dull to merit a movie. However, in the case of this film, the monotony is disrupted because there apparently is a snitch within the prisoners&apos; ranks--some rat is tipping off the Commandant (director Otto Preminger--in one of his few acting roles) about escape attempts, major rule infractions and who the actual perpetrator of a major act of sabotage was.\n\nNaturally, prisoners begin to think that William Holden is the snitch. After all, he is living incredibly well compared to all the other Allied prisoners in the camp due to all his money-making schemes and black market activities. In addition, he is so cynical and apparently unpatriotic that he has no desire to escape--he&apos;s more than willing to sit tight until the war is over since he is safe and happy! In this role, Holden&apos;s character is VERY similar to the one he played in BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI--where he is also a schemer and mostly focused on saving his own sorry butt! However, the problem of the snitch isn&apos;t so simply solved and much of the film is about how Holden proves he was NOT the spy for the Germans.\n\nThe movie is odd in that it is a combination of both drama and comedy--with alternating moods throughout the film. Some of the ways the bored prisoners create their own fun are incredibly funny (especially the &quot;MEIN KAMPF&quot; scene) and some of the moments are poignant and exciting (such as the escape at the end of the film). All this comes together wonderfully in the marvelous ending of the film. The movie features exceptional acting, writing and direction and is one of the best WWII films ever made. See it--it&apos;s well worth your time.",

I didn&apos;t like it all that much when Susan Sontag pretended she was a film director with DUET FOR CANNIBALS."

      "reviewBody": "American Psycho II (2002) \n\nBOMB (out of 4) \n\nIn name only sequel to the cult film has Mila Kunis playing Rachel, a young woman who as a child killed the serial killer Patrick Bateman. Flash forward several years and Rachel is in college trying to become a FBI agent but her goal of becoming her professor&apos;s (William Shatner) assistant means that she will have to turn into a killer to knock off the competition. American PSYCHO II is just a poor cash-in on the cult success of the first film but I really don&apos;t knock it for that. As a fan of horror films I&apos;ve come accustom to cheap knock-offs but the problem with this film is that it&apos;s just not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. The biggest problem for me is the entire tone of the picture, which seems to be wanting to wink at the viewer. Rachel is shown as just a sweet girl next door type and we get some of the worst narration that you&apos;re ever going to hear throughout the movie as we move from one killing to the next. This narration really was some of the worst that I&apos;ve ever heard and it was quite annoying. Even worse is the music score, which also tries to wink at the viewer with its silly light touch. I&apos;m really not sure what the producers were trying to do with this picture but it&apos;s certainly a complete failure from the opening scene to the last. Was this meant to be a spoof of horror pictures? Perhaps but it&apos;s certainly not funny and as I said before, the picture isn&apos;t nearly as clever as it thinks. Even worse is the fact that Kunis is just downright awful here and it&apos;s easy to see why she doesn&apos;t want anyone to bring the picture up. Everything from her line delivery to the way she shows any sort of emotion is just bad. Yes she&apos;s hot but that&apos;s certainly not enough to carry the picture. Shatner is pretty much just cashing a paycheck and adds very little to the picture. Even as a horror film this thing doesn&apos;t work as the death scenes are all forgettable and there&apos;s just not enough sleaze to make it entertaining."

The story of a stubborn village old woman who wishes her grandson marries the richest girl in town to support his studies in Naples and allows her visit Rome is a fun movie with sympathetic characters. The success of the film is maily due to its cast: Renato Salvatori as Raffaele, Tina Pica as nonna Sabella, Silva Koscina as Lucia, Peppino De Filippo as Emilio and Dolores Palumbo as Carmelina. All of them contribute to endow the film with a joyful and happy feeling that benefits the story, based on a book by Pasquale Festa Campanile: La nonna Sabella. The film was a complete success that lead to a sequel with the same cast: La nipote Sabella.",

      "reviewBody": "Football Under Cover is about the trip by a German women football team from Berlin to Iran to play the Iranian women national team; the first ever visit by a foreign ladies team to Iran. The &quot;under cover&quot; in the title refers to the requirement of women, including football players, to wear a head scarf in Iran. This also applied to the German ladies. This highly entertaining film covers the event from inception of the idea to the match itself. It&apos;s full of both poignant and hilarious moments. The most poignant moments concern one of the Iranian women players who, just before the all important game, is omitted from the Iranian team. The reasons for this are never explained, either by the Iranian authorities or the movie.\n\nThe film&apos;s main focus is on the difficulties and restrictions experienced by women in Iran. They are not admitted to stadiums to watch soccer matches, unless it&apos;s a ladies game for which no men spectators are allowed. The women spectators make loud protests during the game but what comes through clearly is the passion of the Iranian women for football and the power of this game to unite people from different cultures. According to the film&apos;s director this movie has not been given clearance to be shown in Iran. However its pirate DVD&apos;s are bound to surface there soon. Catch it if you can!",

She has an unwanted baby and, abandoned by her father and cruel mother-in-law is sent to a harsh reformatory from which she escapes only to wake up one morning and discover she is a prostitute. Brooks is charming and effective as Thymian, a delicate, kind-hearted girl whose innocence is only cruelly taken advantage of - she certainly has no trouble getting us on her side and it&apos;s partly to do with the sense of childish happiness you feel is ready to burst out of her despite the adversity. She looks even cuter with her hair slicked back in the workhouse. Not as powerful and bleakly tragic as Pandora&apos;s Box, made the same year - but, with plenty of humour and some outrageous characterisations, is probably more entertaining."

With the help of two equally powerful warriors (Katt Shea, Susana Traverso), she recruits more rebels before taking the battle to an evil army led by an evil king (Arman Chapman).\n\n Silly, poorly acted (and poorly dubbed) romp is loaded with action and gratuitous nudity (just about every female bares it all, including Clarkson).  Nothing original here, except the heroine using her vagina as a weapon against one of her captors and he complains that she&apos;s &quot;too tight.&quot; Trashy and entertaining at the same time.  My evaluation: ** out of ****."

      "name": "Propaganda movie on a new V-Weapon changing the wars outcome",
      "reviewBody": "Wolfgang Liebeneiner was forced to make this film in September 1944. It is based on a short expose written by man who never existed (only on paper). Historians believe that it was Joseph Goebbels himself, who wrote it as there are certain passages in the script that are identical to some of his speeches held in the years 1943 and 1944. Liebeneiner had no chance of refusing that project as it was an &quot;honour&quot; to be &quot;asked&quot; by the minister of propaganda, so he wanted at least as much salary as Veit Harlan got for his &quot;Kolberg&quot;, as sum nearly 180.000 RM (ReichsMark). Preproduction started soon, but was delayed by Goebbels to late November who had full control over the project and wanted the script re-written. Several authors got under contract, but were fired soon, yet received their full salary. In the end it was the most expensive script ever written in the Third Reich, a sum about 350.000 RM. Liebeneiner wanted the touch and look of &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; of which he had received a stolen copy via the propaganda ministry for studies. It was quite clear to him that a project of such size couldn´t be finished within 3 months. But the things went still on, and the unbalanced fanatism of those days reflected the huge trust in the weapon propaganda to turn the war for the germans. Filming started in mid-December througout the end of the war, yet unfinished. Several problems, all caused by the late stage of the war and the massive destruction of berlin by allied air raids (powerplant shutdowns over several days, shortage of raw stock, destroyed locations outside of UFA-Studios) made this film the last big epic production of the Third Reich.\n\nIn March 1945 the whole production moved to the Luneburger Heide, as there was no bombing and few raids by fighter/bombers. It was obvious even to the last crewmember that the war was lost but Liebeneiner still continued, hoping to prevent everyone from the front AND that he could finish the film some time after the war with a different, more positive ending and a clear message of peace and hope for a better world. It was there when the first troups heading for Berlin found the filmcrew and &quot;freed&quot; it. The film cans had been hidden from the Allies, as the material wasn´t developed yet and Liebeneiner hoped to continue some day. Unfortunately the negatives were eventually destroyed by a fire or found by local residents who traded it or burned it. Liebeneiner and all of his crewmembers or actors withstood a warcrimes trial (except Heinrich George), so they were able to begin working soon after the war had ended. Liebeneiner later got the head of the Vienna Film Academy who died in 1987. There is a small anecdote on the atmosphere on the set:\n\nEveryday the 2nd Ass. Director came in in the morning, gathering all members around him and asking &quot;Isn´t life wonderful?&quot; with everyone answering loud (not without sarcasm) &quot;Yes, it is!&quot;.\n\nToday it still unknown if there exist some copies of the original negatives or dailies. Only five stills had been made (that still exist) in an early state of production, a scene where Hilde Kral and Gustav Knuth are in the kitchen cooking pancakes."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.\n\nFew movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it&apos;s a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as &quot;cheesy.&quot;\n\nI read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film&apos;s snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That&apos;s not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,\n\nFor a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.\n\nMacMurray&apos;s narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.\n\nStanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.\n\nThis film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, &quot;Body Heat,&quot; starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.",

      "reviewBody": "The first of the Toho &quot;Dai Kaiju&quot; series in colour and some of Eiji Tsuburaya&apos;s best special effects. Although shorn to a miserly 69 minutes of the original Japanese footage (plus nearly 4 minutes of actual H-Bomb test footage stuck to the beginning by the American distributors, The King Brothers) it is a fabulously made picture.\n\nCoal miners discover gigantic insects, known as Meganurons in the original version, which attack the local village. As if that were not bad enough a monstrous flying reptile soon hatches from an egg which has also been unearthed. Rodan&apos;s appearance is a &quot;good news/bad news&quot; thing because he eats the giant insects, but he also causes more damage than they ever could have!\n\nThe King Brothers, who would also give us GORGO a few years later, saved money by simply repeating certain scenes and &quot;flopping&quot; the image on the screen so it would look (slightly) different. Rodan and its mate appear out of the same crater in the American version. In the original version the second Rodan appears with no explanation as the first one is destroying the city of Sasebo. The narration probably saved time and allowed them to use less of the Japanese footage but having seen the original version I prefer the visual aspects of it (the end sequence is just as poignant and memorable without any dialogue).\n\nLovers of dubbed movies will recognise the voices of Paul Frees and Marvin Miller doing almost every voice in the picture! Keye Luke, a former Number One Son in Charlie Chan movies, provides the voice of the hero and a teenaged George Takei (later Mr. Sulu on &quot;Star Trek&quot;) can be heard also. Look carefully during the destruction of the city and you will notice one building, a camera company, is called &quot;The Tsuburaya Company&quot;!\n\nIn todays genres where every movie is over-laden with CGI people should pause long enough to watch this movie and see what could be done with miniatures, imagination, and heart. Eiji Tsuburaya really loved the genre and gave his best to every assignment but THIS will always be one of his best.\n\nOh and about the monsters name. It was originally RADON but a British toy company had a doll on the market with that name so when the movie went abroad they simply switched the vowels in the monster&apos;s name and Radon became Rodan."

      "reviewBody": "This could be argued to be one of Van Damme&apos;s best film. Not only for his amazing fight scenes, but also for his acting ability along side himself. Not writing here as biased fan, but seeing this film, I shockingly had to admit that Van Damme was far better actor then what people gave him credit for. \n\nStory of the film is very cliché of most 90&apos;s films. twins get separated at birth and one becomes a criminal while the other one becomes a goody boy. They both have to team up together to protect their family money and name. Which one or both didn&apos;t really care for before.\n\nActing in the film, was fairly good, with few exceptions. But people going to see this film, knew that this wasn&apos;t going to be the competition for Dances with a wolf or Jeremy Irons performance in Reversal of Fortune. The expectations was that this was going to be enjoyable film with tons of action and the possibility of having Van Damme fight Van Damme in an amazing fight scene. Which the film succeeded in. Van Damme was very clear as two different brothers, who are completely different in all traits. Van Damme managed to create and contain certain ticks, tricks and mannerisms for each one, clear sign of a good actor. Not to mention all of the really cool fight scenes we got to see was a benefit too!!\n\nso if you are bored at home and have nothing to do, feel free to give this film a go, if you like 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s action type of movies, you will love this.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a bit of an oddity.  Usually movies are either really good or really bad all the way through.  Rarely do I see a film where there are a ton of good moments, but just as many dumb ones.  I mean, this film really tries to take cop movies in a different direction in many ways.  Example one: our hero cop is female.  Example two: our obligatory psycho is a commodities trader(???).  Example three: something I&apos;ve never seen from a movie wacko: he actually hears voices!  So many times the killer is without explanation doing what he&apos;s doing.  But here, Silver actually has extended scenes where he&apos;s hearing someone(?) and possibly trying to fight them.  It&apos;s never explained.  Which is where we get into the negative elements, as Silver&apos;s motivation isn&apos;t fleshed out.  Was he a psycho before the early scene shootout?  Why is he a nut?  We never know, except that he feels a certain power in killing.  Plus, even though I appreciated the attempt, his freaky moments of hearing whomever come off a bit silly.  But back on the good side he has some very effective moments with Curtis, which mix psychosis and sexualitly nicely.  The NYC locations are also well used thanks to some nice cinematographic touches.  Ah, alas, we must go back to the junk side, particularly Curtis&apos; cliched superiors.  All the typical &quot;My ass in a sling! Mayor&apos;s ass in a sling!  Chief&apos;s ass in a sling!&quot;  Or TWO superiors, who in reference to a scene from the beginning, falsely say that Curtis blew the guy&apos;s HEAD off.  Her shots were grouped in his chest and never at his head. For them to TWICE proclaim otherwise put a big hole in their credibility. Then you have a totally underdeveloped subplot about Curtis father, who is apparently beating her mother.  He is rightfully arrested only to be forgiven moments later and back at the house (what is veteran Bosco doing in such a poorly defined roll??).  Or how bout when Jamie Lee beds down with a superior...right after the killer has just run off into the night in front of them!!!  Tack on an overlong and predictable ending and you have something that started off in the right direction but quickly veered into an NYC pothole."

There is no compassion for this man, and indeed, he asks for none.  The conclusion to the film is really the only ending that could have been believable, but still no compassion.  While this film is not one to watch for entertainment value, it is a good one to watch for plot and character acting value.  Don&apos;t expect a nice story, and you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

I&apos;m afraid that Gary Busey is a weak act in this movie reminding me that this is a B grader and not a star studded cast. No mindblowing camera or lighting work as a matter of fact it really belongs on daytime TV. With Michael madsen playing the dodgy cop who smokes and swears a lot ( mmmmmmm thats a new role for him ) NOT. The movie is pretty predictable right through to the end scene when finally there is a small twist. My video case boasts &quot;Independent video release of the year 1998 VSDA Award Winning&quot; ........What??? Yeah right! I reccomend you watch it in the afternoon when you&apos;re bored and havent anything better to do like I did. Outta 10 ....about 4 and thats because Vosloo made a good effort when the odds were against him starring in a  B grade movie with a B grade cast",

Carpenter self-consciously uses Hawks&apos; &apos;Rio Bravo&apos;, adds a touch of Romero&apos;s &apos;Night Of The Living Dead&apos; and comes up with arguably the most exciting siege movie of all time. This gem is a perfect example of superior low budget film making. Relative unknowns Austin Stoker (&apos;Abby&apos;) and Darwin Joston (&apos;Eraserhead&apos;) are both outstanding as the stars of this taut and unpredictable thriller, and the supporting cast includes Laurie Zimmer (sadly her only movie), Nancy Loomis (&apos;Halloween&apos;), Kim Richards (&apos;The Car&apos; - in the movie&apos;s most controversial and memorable scene), and Carpenter semi-regular Charles Cyphers (&apos;Escape From New York&apos;). One of Carpenter&apos;s best efforts and overall an extraordinarily underrated movie. &apos;Assault On Precinct 13&apos; is a classic! Add this to your &quot;must see&quot; list immediately!"

A family formed by a father named Don(Robert Carlyle) and sons, Tammy(Imagen Poots)and Andy(Mckintosh)are reunited .But one of them spreads the epidemic, the rage virus outbreaks and re-ignites the infection infiltrating in the secured zone , causing wreak havoc and death .Those exposed cruel biting suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos. The sons escape and are helped by a soldier(Jeremy Renner) and a military doctor(Rose Byrne).The military take on zombies and the survivors are surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic.\n\nThis moving film contains chills, thrills, horror and lots of blood and gore.The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, shocks and tension.The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving .The make-up assistant create a truly frightening zombie cannibals. Terrifying and astonishing frames about apocalyptic events with deserted streets, and creepy mood at London without people totally uninhabited , similarly to classics movies, such as ¨Quatermas and pit, Omega man and Lifeforce¨. I think this movie is better than previous original, because packs more action and more breathtaking images. Casting is frankly well, along with distinguished players, Robert Carlyle, Catherine McCormack, Rose Byrne, Harold Perrineau, appear young promises,as Imagen Poots and Mckintosh.Nice cinematography , using steadycam and photographed in videotape by Enrique Chediak. Atmospheric and haunting musical score by John Murphy ,composed in the same style from &apos;28 days later&apos;by Danny Boyle(also producer along with Alex Garland) . The flick is surprisingly realized with startling visual style by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo(Intacto). Rating : Better than average, this horror story will leave you stunned.",

There are shades of la Dolce Vita since every scene takes place in summer and features incredible clothing, but our point of view here is radically different: it is that of a vulnerable young woman instead of a successful jaded male intellectual like in the Fellini movie. The vita is not so dolce for the girl played by the innocent-looking Stefania Sandrelli (who was apparently only 19 when she starred in that film, but what maturity she displays as an actress already.) A peasant girl from the sticks, we meet her right away in Rome where she aspires to glamour, stardom, fame etc. But because she does not know anyone, and is both naive and not very bright to boot, she takes many wrong turns and indulges all the wrong people. This film is very entertaining, because we are in Rome in 1964, it feels and looks like a hot summer all along, and the dresses worn by Sandrelli are unbelievably glamorous. But it is a ferocious social satire, and it is tender neither to our silly heroine nor to the sharks who exploit her and many others. The black&amp;white photography is gorgeous on the eyes. Nino Manfredi and Ugo Tognazzi do each a memorable turn among the victim/exploiters that populates this Roman shark tank. Sandrelli is so good (and so beautiful) that she manages to make her character attaching in spite of her flaws.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this film when I was about 5 or 6, and to this day I&apos;ve always loved it! Just the story, the voices the songs, the animation was really cute and simple, the gorgeous backgrounds- Liza Minnelli is in the lead as the voice of &apos;Dorothy&apos;, the rest of the cast include, Mickey Rooney (Scarecrow), Ethel Merman (Mombi-the wicked witch of the west&apos;s cousin) Paul Lynde (Pumpkin head), and the original &apos;wicked witch of ther west&apos; from the 1939 MGM classic, does a cameo as Dorothy&apos;s Aunt Em! The plot is a mesh of &quot;Ozma Of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Land Of OZ&quot; (The wizard of oz&apos;s author&apos;s, other book sequels) I&apos;ve always loved this movie, it is a little cheesy mind you, (and some of the songs would be severly critisced by film critics)and are waaaay too long, but the story is a good sequel, it fits in better to the mgm version everyone knows, better than the 1985 film &quot;return To Oz&quot; (which i also love mind you) because it has, the same cheery backdrops, songs, and voices. This film is very rare and hardly known by anyone. In 1964, apparently Liza Minnelli PROUDLY recorded the voice for Dorothy, but then regretted doing it later on, and was embarrassed, seing as it was was designed as a crude exploit of her mother&apos;s (Judy Garland&apos;s)  work!.... &quot;It was easy&quot; quotes Liza, &quot;All I had to do was mimick my momma&apos;s voice!&quot; Anyway it&apos;s an excellent film, (it should keep most children entertained--all the one i&apos;ve showed it to have been anyway)so if you are a die-hard Oz-fan you should see, it (it&apos;s on video) I personally have &quot;Journey Back To Oz&quot; in my video collection, and it is a favourite for little cousins e.t.c!\n\nP.S I LOVE the soundtrack score for the &apos;tornado&apos; scene! It&apos;s so dramatic and awesome! you&apos;ve never heard anything like it! it&apos;s really cool with heaps of differant instruments!"

The Story is a figment of fiction in Ghai&apos;s mind. Only in his mind do we see &quot;Lady Catherine&quot; (when did she get knighted? did I miss this Ceremony?) donating enormous amount of money (like zillions of crores) to charity, still she has some loose change left for the child dancers. Only in his mind do we see Kisna, killing his kith and Kin because he promised his mother that he would get Catherine to Delhi-but I missed the part where his mother told him to sing romantic duets on the way. At one point he says he is saving Catherine from the evil Prince-which one is it? or do we care at this point? Ghai, who is credited for the story and direction, makes a mess of both. The direction is disjointed. The Debutante,. Isha Sherwani, is incredibly co-ordinated (if Ghai, has his way, her Career will be on hold meditating at the end of the rope.) She and Hrithik Roshan would make a great dancing couple in a Musical, if only a good producer could take a hint. Antonia Bernath must have graduated from the &quot;Aishwarya Rai School of dramatic acting&quot;. She speaks Hindi with a Cockney accent-and this get to be painful and ridiculous after a while. Vivek Oberoi, this guy has no Screen presence for a leading part, he should confine to playing hoodlums in movies like &quot;Company&quot;. The music is good-specially the last duet is an absolute melody. The Production values are good as in a Ghai Film, but everything else is atrocious."

      "reviewBody": "Richard Curtis&apos; first &apos;non romantic comedy film&apos; is really another romantic comedy film- it&apos;s just that the romantic bit gets swamped within 20 other sub-plots so you try and not notice.\n\nThe Boat That Rocked sees Carl ( Tom Surridge ) go aboard Radio Rock- a pirate radio station owned by Quentin ( Bill Nighy ) whose DJ&apos;s (Phillip Semour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Chris O&apos; Dowd, Rhys Darby, etc. ) broadcast 24-hour rock and roll music to the UK. They are adored by the populace but hated by the government, including the Minister of Communications ( Kenneth Branagh ) and his chief subordinate ( Jack Davenport ) who aim to shut them down.\n\nIf that was the extent of the plot then it would probably be a 100 mins film. However the Boat That Rocked has so many little sub-plots- many seeming like excuses to put in another montage or cameo cast appearance that the time has ballooned out to 154mins and it does tell at times. Furthermore, while Richard Curtis is entitled to look back on these days with an air of nostalgia, he sometimes seems to get a little too weepy eyed with the story.\n\nBut these faults are more than made up for in the performances; all of which are good- and some are outstanding. Phillip Seymour Hoffman&apos;s Count is a lovable character who approaches everything with great gusto, while Chris O&apos; Dowd&apos;s Simple Simon has a wonderful part in the middle section of the movie which brings a little bit of emotion to what is a pretty emotionally vacant movie. Nick Frost is cheeky as Dr Dave and finally Rhys Darby- fresh from Flight of the Conchords- simply shines in his role as the unpopular and daggy Angus who nonetheless gets arguably the best line in the whole movie.\n\nOverall the Boat That Rocked is silly and entertaining fun. It does get overweight by a looong script, but the soundtrack and the cast are good enough to carry it through.",

      "reviewBody": "A film that explores the dark and miserable town, Basin City, and tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption.\n\nAlthough the use of digital filming and CGI is very contentious, Robert Rodriguez found a way to make it work to his advantage in a way that may not have been possible with traditional film. The way the black and white brings the noir to life, blending smoothly with the rare other colors... it is the only way to bring a comic book to life. (A similar style is in &quot;The Spirit&quot;, which does not get nearly the respect it deserves.)\n\nThis casting is incredible, as it is varied and really brought the best performances out of Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba that their careers ever had. Mickey Rourke was re-invented, and this may have been one of the last great Bruce Willis roles. Such a powerful film.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;If You Live, Shoot!&quot; offers an intense diversion for fans of the Spaghetti Western. It goes on for quite a long time, and gets dull on occasion, but it&apos;s also noteworthy for its content. It&apos;s on record as one of the most utterly nasty of all SWs, with plenty of bright red movie blood and depictions of sadism.\n\nIt&apos;s actually not particularly surreal most of the time, telling a rather linear story of The Stranger (Tomas Milian), who was double crossed by his partners in a heist, and shot &amp; left for dead. The opening credits see him emerge from his grave, and two Indians (Miguel Serrano and Angel Silva) witness this. They vow to stay at his side and assist him, under the condition that he tell them what it&apos;s like on the &quot;other side&quot;.\n\nHowever, this isn&apos;t really what you would call a revenge saga. Soon, The Stranger is getting caught up in greed and corruption in a small town known to Indians either as &quot;The Field of Anguish&quot; or &quot;The Unhappy Place&quot; (depending on which version you&apos;re watching). He gets involved as a few warring factions try desperately to lay their mitts on the gold snatched by The Stranger &amp; gang.\n\nCo-writer / director Giulio Questi (&quot;Death Laid an Egg&quot;) takes his time telling the story, but does populate it with some enjoyably despicable villains, such as Oaks (Piero Lulli), Hagerman (Francisco Sanz), Sorrow (Roberto Camardiel), and Bill Templer (Milo Quesada). There&apos;s an especially fun comeuppance for one of them. Add to that an atmospheric score by Ivan Vandor, two beauties (Patrizia Valturri and Marilu Tolo), and a sense of mysticism, and the results are generally agreeable. The handsome young Milian has charisma sufficient enough for one to remain invested in his character. Ray Lovelock of &quot;The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue&quot; fame also appears.\n\nGood entertainment overall, and worth a look for any SW completist.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "name": "A true black comedy",
      "reviewBody": "This black comedy is a story of Pierce (Dylan Moran) and Mark (Mark Doherty), two jobless Irish friends sharing a run down apartment with Mark&apos;s girlfriend Sally (Amy Huberman), and Mark&apos;s disabled brother David (David O&apos;Doherty). The apartment is owned by a disgruntled Jack (Keith Allen). The movie suddenly takes a turn for the worse one day in their uneventful and eroding lives.\n\nThe movie really takes the very definitive yet subtle elements of black comedy and ties it together with very interesting plot twists. Although no comparison can be made, for the sake of a relative scale- A Film with Me in It is abreast with some of the blackest comedy works of the Coen Brothers (such as Burn After Reading, Barton Fink and The Man Who Wasn&apos;t There).\n\nThe movie tends to drag a little here and there, but makes up for it in the fine character development and cinematography. As the plot progresses, the viewer is often subtly taunted to question their understanding of the story so far.\n\nI&apos;m a fan of Dylan Moran&apos;s stand-up work, and he has lived up to my expectations of him on the screen as well. All in all, it&apos;s definitely a good watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Back in 2000s, Indonesian horror films were packed with indigenous ghosts with vast of production values, filmmaking style, and popularity. The director&apos;s just known for his popular film Pocong 2 and around that time, has this peculiar style of filmmaking with 7 shooting days rule. So we must acknowledge this before watch and review the title.\n\nThis movie certainly produced under the Pocong title and has few big young actors at that time. However, their name doesn&apos;t live up the expectations by its super cheap production values that is so obvious. From shaky handheld camera, lots of goofs, underdeveloped production design (aside from the car crash scene), unable to provide good jumpscares, making the question arises &quot;Do they even committed to make this movie?&quot;\n\nOne of the reason I watch this movie twice (first in its release year), due to the whole plot, despite have many holes, gives many twist elements that still seldom used back in 2000s horror films in Indonesia. It&apos;s not that great but still a good thing compared to lots of ghost titles that offer nothing but jumpscares to the death. If the movie more committed to the production value and making the technical aspects better, this movie will be a great watchlist for those who enjoy cheap scares. Alas, the movie must suppress its budget or something so what&apos;s left is the subtle appreciation to the twist and that&apos;s not making all aspects here better.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; is more outrageous than the combined monologues of Ricky Gervais on the Golden Globes Awards.\n\nThe people who will definitely get their money&apos;s worth out of this film are the easily offended; for them there is something to offend every couple of minutes.\n\nA number of critics felt the film &quot;...hovered uncomfortably between comedy and satire...&quot; but who cares about genre when it&apos;s this funny.\n\nI loved it.\n\nDespite the high school setting - elite Roxbury Academy in Beverly Hills - it&apos;s not another &quot;Clueless&quot; or &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. It possesses more the anarchic spirit of &quot;God Bless America&quot;.\n\nThe script is clever; perception is a key motif throughout, and the way the film revisits earlier scenes to show what really happened is inspired.\n\nAlthough Evan Rachel Wood&apos;s character, Kimberly Joyce, seems interested in the well-being of others, she really has no filter; manipulation and passive aggressiveness are built into her DNA. Although she blatantly parades her hypocrisy, she also exposes it in just about everyone around her - often hilariously. In the end though, vulnerabilities are exposed.\n\nWhen she befriends a quiet, Middle Eastern student, Kimberly&apos;s cynical views on migrants, race, religion, sex and just about everything else come to the fore - nothing is sacred. However one commentator nailed it when he said that Kimberly does all this with such obvious pleasure in naughtiness that she&apos;s impossible to hate.\n\nThe film has an original score by Gilad Benamram. It&apos;s light and chilled, and acts as a dispassionate commentator as events unfold.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood&apos;s performance is mesmerizing, However, I have one criticism, as others have noted, she slurs her words and speaks so fast it&apos;s sometimes hard to understand her. I found myself straining to catch the dialogue, but I didn&apos;t want to miss a word because I was enjoying it so much.\n\n&quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; is fifteen years old now, but has lost none of its bite. Forget the negative comments. This one will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for Kimberly to reveal the next nugget of political incorrectness.",

      "reviewBody": "The plot to &quot;Shadow of the Wolf&quot; is nearly identical at times to the 1933 film &quot;Eskimo&quot; as well as 1960&apos;s &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot;....so much so that I am surprised that IMDB doesn&apos;t list these in the connections section. All the films are about an innocent Inuit man being chased by Canadian Mounties for a murder.\n\nThe story begins with Agaguk (Lou Diamond Phillips) killing a polar bear with a knife! Despite this heroic deed, this father (Toshiro Mifune) is a bit of a jerk and they argue. Later, Agaguk learns that his father sold the polar bear pelt to a trader...even though it was not his to sell and the trader knew this. Agaguk feels annoyed...but before he can do more, the stupid trader tries to murder him...but is killed in the process. Clearly it&apos;s a case of self-defense...though soon he is chased by a Mountie (Donald Sutherland) and this makes up the rest of the film. But on his way to look for the killer, the Mountie stops by Agaguk to investigate...and Agaguk&apos;s father takes things into his own hands.\n\nLike too many films, the natives in the film are all played by non-native actors (Phillips and Jennifer Tilly have a little native American blood...just a wee bit...and Mifune is Japanese). I am not sure if this is a bad thing or not, as I have no idea if there were any Inuit/First Nations/Eskimo (whatever term you use) actors who could have played these roles. It simply could have been done for marketability (putting stars in the leads) or there weren&apos;t native actors able to play these roles. I have no idea.\n\nSo is the film any good? Well, the filmmakers get the look of the film right and manage to make a compelling tale. It is interesting and kept my interest throughout. It&apos;s well worth seeing...and is better than its current score of 5.8. However, if you can find it, &quot;Eskimo&quot; is even better...and the two films are different enough it merits seeing them both.",

      "reviewBody": "Remember Betty Bronson and Ernest Torrence as both Peter Pan and Captain Hook respectively?  Doubt it.  That is because to even my amazement, the last time the true story of Peter Pan was done in a live action format was in 1924 starring the two above mentioned actors that while appearing in over 80 films collectively, we probably wouldn&apos;t recognize them if they walked down the street with name tags on their shirts.\n\nEnter December 2003, and P.J. Hogan&apos;s retelling of the classic tale that hit theatres amongst all the Oscar hopefuls and faded from memory before recouping even half of its reported $100 million dollar budget.  Thank God for DVD.  \n\nTo have to spend time telling the true story of Peter Pan would mean that the reader of the critique was robbed of an incredible children&apos;s story about a fantasy land where kids never grew up and a pirate by the name of Hook set out on a personal crusade to avenge the hand he lost in an earlier confrontation with his nemesis, Pan.\n\nThis updated version stars a bunch of newbies or character actors that might seem familiar if unplaced at the time of your viewing.  In the role of Peter Pan is Jeremy Sumpter a young child destined for stardom that first took our notice as the young Adam in Bill Paxton&apos;s Frailty.  He, alongside his fairy friend known to us as Tink&apos;, he travels from Neverland to England where he hovers outside a families window to hear the stories of adventure as told by the eldest daughter, Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood).  \n\nIt is not long before the two become acquainted, and Wendy with her two brothers agree to leave their oppressive parentally controlled world and follow Peter and Tink back to a land where children run free and never get old.   But pursued to the ruthless Hook and his pirates entourage, there are lessons to be learned, enemies to be defeated and as is ultimate in any fairy tale, a happy ending to endure.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice while watching Peter Pan is the incredible production values.  Shot in Australia and New Zealand, Universal Studios spared no expense in bringing the childhood story to life.  How Peter Pan chases his shadow, how the fairies all fly into their tree loft and the incredibly vibrant colors are all testament to P.J. Hogan&apos;s unique vision of telling story as it was J.M. Barrie almost 80 years earlier.  Most fascinating is how the art of film flying has evolved from the blue screen laughers almost 80 years earlier.  Most fascinating is how the art of film flying has evolved from the blue screen laughers as seen in the Superman franchise to its perfected state in Peter Pan.   When Pan and Hook eventually fight amongst the clouds and ships masts in the climax, the shadows are just perfect, the effects are not hokey and the style allows for the actors to feel free from the restraints of the conventional wires we were accustomed to seeing in cheaper adaptations.\n\nSure, there was a few things that bothered me a little (the repeating 5 note musical score for one), but I was amazed how transformed I became while watching a movie that I was embarrassed that I coupled with Kill Bill Vol. 1 with my rental at the video store.  A story that I had seen so many times before in so many formats (plays, animation etc.) was made fresh again by the highly entertaining energy that the cast all put into their roles.\n\n I will admit that Peter Pan is not for everyone.  The cynical will call it average and those that are still drinking heavily to try and forget Steven Spielberg&apos;s 1991 failed effort Hook, might not be over the nightmares to enjoy this jaunt.  \n\nHowever, with or without a family by your side, this is one of the forgotten films of 2003 that deserves a rental and an open mind.\n\nwww.gregrants.com",

To be as concise as I can be- It is funny, it makes you want to go to Munich and drink lots of beer (just like Goodfellas makes me want to smoke cigarettes) and it has a good heart. In my neck of the woods a matinée is $7.50 and that was about what I&apos;d say it was worth. It can vary slightly at times from the plot to make a bad joke, and it gets a little hokey after the funeral (I&apos;m not spoiling anything there) but it has a few classic lines, some interesting comments on society and American prejudices, dishes slightly below the belt without offending anyone, is filled with toilet humor, and throws in some eye candy to (das) boot. If you know your Germanic cinema history there are some subtle and not so subtle homages. Just like SoaP, don&apos;t go in expecting art, and you will come out with a smile. Ribbit!",

      "reviewBody": "Otto (as usually playing himself or rather his stage-persona) and his friends live on the North-Sea-island of Spiegeleiland (&quot;Fried Egg Island&quot;) and seek to lure tourists over the internet. Unfortunately they get a visit from corrupt Casino-owner Du Merzac (Sky du Mont; Otto&apos;s rival in this very first movie 30+ years ago, the name being a name-play on &quot;stupid scumbag&quot;) discovers that Otto has inherited a valuable painting and decides to steal it. Otto and his entourage follow the thief to the mainland and, by digging a tunnel under his casino, try to return the valuable heirloom.\n\nI&apos;ve mentioned it in other reviews, but will say it again here: in his high time, the 1970&apos;s and 80&apos;s, there was virtually no way to get around Otto Waalkes. As kids, one would trade Otto-audio-tapes, books and other merchandise among each other, rattle down his jokes, which pretty much everybody knew by heart already and the parents would let their kids stay up late, so they could watch his stand-up routine (a mix of slapstick, linguistic humour, spoofs and musical interludes). Not to mention, this first cinema-movie (&quot;Otto – Der Film&quot;) remains one of the bestselling local films of all times. Indeed, though no fancy intellectual humour, appealing more to the bourgeois rather than the high-class, Otto had built a memorial for himself – and that&apos;s pretty much where the decline started. Did I say decline? No, perhaps &quot;decay&quot; would be the better word yet.\n\nIn this 40-odd years, Otto has not changed or progressed one single iota, performing – or rather recycling – the same old jokes, sticking 100 percent to his quirky stage-persona (including during interviews), to an extent where one seriously asks himself: was this ever funny? And, if so, why? Sure, one can look through the rosy lenses of nostalgia but essentially it&apos;s like listening to an old, worn-out uncle, who (literally) keeps telling the same joke that amused you when you were a kid and he was still a young dude. In short: nothing short of pathetic. And it&apos;s not like Otto had reached a pinnacle with the pitiful display in &quot;Otto&apos;s Eleven&quot; yet – for that you&apos;d have to wait another six years, until he produced and starred in &quot;Kartoffelsalad&quot;, a movie – if you want to call it that – which very deceivingly stayed on the bottom of IMDb&apos;s &quot;Bottom-100&quot;-List for a good amount of time.\n\nIt must be said, Otto&apos;s greatest strength in his glory time was, that he had a touch on the pulse of time. His parodies were usually spot on and as he once quirked at his musical parodies: &quot;I would just sit around and wait for a song to become famous, so I could take the p**s out of it&quot;. It&apos;s very clear here that Otto has lost that touch a long time ago. As one can imagine from the basic storyline, Otto and his crew merely spoof films like &quot;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&quot;, &quot;Ladykillers&quot; and a number of other crime-films, peppered up with the same, lame old jokes that have been in his repertoire for a long, long time.\n\nAs for the rest of the cast: Mirco Nontschew&apos;s form of comedy can only be described as &quot;pulling grimaces&quot;, Rick Kavanian is usually the sidekick of one of the most successful Otto-clones (Bully Herbig) and Max Giermann will probably best be remembered for his Klaus Kinski impersonation, which he performs to perfection, although the routine is getting slightly thin. Highlights would be Sky du Mont, an otherwise rather versatile actor, who unfortunately never got as far as he could have and Olli Dietrich. Dietrich, best known for his role in the improvisation-show &quot;Dittsche&quot;, plays the journalist Harry Hirsch, which used to be one of Otto&apos;s most famous and enduring comedy-alter-egos. None of those mentioned are able to lift this flick beyond dire mediocrity. More than 3/10 I cannot give and even have a suspicion that one of those points came from sheer pits and for the old-times-sake.",

      "name": "Interesting Ty Hardin Euro-western dealing with racial issues",
      "reviewBody": "As a pre-1966 Italian western, this film does not have many of the &quot;trademarks&quot; of the spaghetti western--there&apos;s no heavily echoed Duane Eddy-style guitar on the soundtrack, no extreme close-ups, no focus on desolate landscapes, no nihilistic feel. A young lady is attacked by three Indians (who look like Italian hippies!), but she manages to escape and is found wandering in the wildnerness by Ty Hardin, who nurses her back to health and proposes to take her to El Paso to a mission where Hardin&apos;s daughter is staying and where the lady will be safe and cared for. After fifteen minutes, that seems to be the &quot;plot&quot; of CURSED VALLEY, but nothing is ever as simple as it seems, and new characters and new layers of complexity begin to emerge until we are enmeshed in a difficult situation among warring family members with the added problem of the original Indians still trying to track down the lady. As the film proceeds, it brings up a number of interesting issues including racially mixed marriages, which it deals with in a surprisingly complex and mature manner. Visually, the film is attractive (the circulating video is letterboxed) with a number of well-composed shots (the one where Torito, the lady&apos;s husband, watches through a window his wife leaving with Hardin I still remember). Director Primo Zeglio (here using the Omar Hopkins pseudonym) also directed such interesting films as SON OF THE RED CORSAIR with Lex Barker (see my review), MORGAN THE PIRATE with Steve Reeves, the US-TV staple SEVEN SEAS TO CALAIS with Rod Taylor, and the space opera MISSION STARDUST with Lang Jeffries as sci-fi pulp hero Perry Rhodan. At this point in his career,Ty Hardin was only a few years away from his starring role as Bronco Layne in the BRONCO TV series (which still holds up well today), and had recently appeared in such hits as PT 109 and BATTLE OF THE BULGE. CURSED VALLEY seems to be his first European credit--he went on to make many films overseas. Unfortunately, Hardin does not dub his own voice here, so his performance is not as effective as it could have been, though it works well enough anyway (and Hardin&apos;s female fans should note that he appears without his shirt in a number of scenes in the first half hour). Overall, this is an interesting western, though not a typical Italian western. The musical score is quite rousing, often sounding like music from some 50s television western or a Republic western. Except for an acoustic guitar sequence, it does not have a spaghetti western feel at all. I consider this an above average western and would recommend it to any Eurowestern, western, or Ty Hardin fans.",

This is the glorious film which manifests the beauty of cinema. And the grabbing of the cinema the hands of life. The setting is great. The story is great. The Music is fabulous. Characters are enormous, perfectly acted. That is a film I wanted to last for 9 hours. This film also gives you that feeling as well. A perfect master piece. Why did so few people commented on that.

You get your suspense, excitement, intrigue and lots of close-ups on some gorgeous hunks. Not so bad at all."

      "name": "Too unconvincing, excessive and messy to really be enjoyable or engaging",
      "reviewBody": "When he is attacked and robbed of his animals, Max Rockatansky follows his attackers to Bartertown  a den of deceit and violence that is made possible thanks to the methane power source from pigs kept underground. Bartertown may be ruled above ground by Aunty Entity but the real owner is Master Blaster  a team of two men who control the power supply. In exchange for his goods, Aunty offers Max a deal where he will challenge Blaster to a fight in the town&apos;s duelling arena and kill him thus removing the muscle and putting Master under Aunty&apos;s control. Max accepts, although he rightly suspects that he will be the next to be betrayed.\n\nAt least one reviewer on this site has said that the reason people dislike this film is because it is about the start of a new world whereas the other two Mad Max films were about the end of the world as we know it. Sadly I believe he is mistaken because I think the reason people dislike this film is because it is messy, excessive, unconvincing (even within the apocalyptic situation it makes no sense) and just isn&apos;t really any good. The plot swings between an excessive violent society at the start, to a child colony in the middle to a big noisy chase scene right at the end. In terms of the narrative that connects this all, don&apos;t worry about that because it doesn&apos;t really work and just feels very episodic throughout  making it messy and uninteresting. It is unconvincing and, although I accept that the entire film is fantasy, you gotta wonder where all the excesses and such came from and how we were supposed to buy into it; hell, a fuel blockade by lorry drivers brought the UK to its knees a few years ago but yet we&apos;re suppose to believe this? The apocalyptic here lacks imagination and just feels like the sort of thing that exists in an art director&apos;s mind rather than something that convinces.\n\nThe episodic feel isn&apos;t helped by the rambling, pointless dialogue associated with the children  it tries to have a mysticism that nothing else in the film has worked to deserve; however it could be helped by developing Max better. If he was a strong lynch pin holding all these bits and pieces together then it would matter less but he isn&apos;t  he is just a grunting rock that doesn&apos;t really have a character to speak of and I had little or no interest in him at all  even when he becomes &quot;caring and sharing&quot; I didn&apos;t care because I had had nothing to work with up till that point. Turner is not terrible but she doesn&apos;t really act and just sort of swans around in an unconvincing manner. In that regard she is like the majority of the cast, who don&apos;t really give the performances  whether it e the clunky child actors or the grunting brutes that are just stunt fodder. The stunts are OK and the final chase provides some distraction but without really caring about the plot or the characters, I found it hard to get into any action.\n\nOverall a disappointing film whose core failing is the lack of a convincing new world. The film feels episodic and lacks anything to hold it together. Throwing a lot of cars around at the end does provide some distraction but by then it was too late for me and the whole thing was clunky, pointless and surprisingly uninteresting."

The costumes, by the director&apos;s then wife Shirley are amazing but really only help to feed in to the overall campiness of the proceedings. I can imagine Ken bouncing about encouraging everyone to give it their all and this certainly seems to have born fruit with Peter Vaughan&apos;s ecstatic performance towards the end but it also means that poor little Felicity Kendal, always the most measured of actresses, actually overacts here. A camp extravaganza that I&apos;m sure many can enjoy but I would have preferred just a little more insight. The Fatty Arbuckle portrayal is unforgivable, never mind that of Valentino himself.",

      "name": "melodrama lifted up into perverse tragedy as only Bunuel can do",
      "reviewBody": "It might appear to the uninitiated that Luis Bunuel is making with Tristana at first a good but very predictable melodrama that turns somewhere in the second half mark into a strange power-play of desire turned on its head. But in reality, when looking at it after seeing a couple of his films, Bunuel&apos;s work with Tristana is somehow kind of touching. He cares about all of his characters- none of whom what they seem or dumbed down to Lifetime movie levels- and in this stuck-in-its-ways society there are boundaries that are crossed in tragic means. Usually one might expect some dark or subtle comedy of manners or satire on society, but here it&apos;s stripped away, as it was for some of Viridiana, and all that&apos;s left is a spare, tense and expertly manipulated tale where the tables are turned once or twice on the couple of Don Lope (Fernando Rey) and Tristana (Catherine Deneauve, maybe her most physically demanding of her two Bunuel roles).\n\nOne thing that&apos;s extraordinary about how Bunuel directs and allows for his actors to play the scenes is that the emotions are only heightened to a certain level, and never with the aid of things like music or tears. It is what it is: Don Lope has taken care of Tristana as her guardian since her mother died, and now has inserted himself as her father/husband figure, with his servant Saturna (stern-faced but understanding Lola Gaos) a kind of unofficial confessional. Tristana wants some freedom, just to go out and walk around, and feels caught by Don Lope even when not doing anything... until she meets Franco Nero&apos;s Don Horacio, a painter who could promise a new life. This goes without saying that one should take it for granted that Tristana isn&apos;t *that* young and could take care of herself without Lope, but maybe this is part of the point of the slight absurdity- and eventual tragedy- of this struggle.\n\nTwo years go by after she leaves Lope for Horacio, with a tumor in her leg. She&apos;s now a cripple, and now once again a kind of mental prisoner in Lope&apos;s home; the complexity of old man Lope as being duplicitous is seen right after he finds out she&apos;s sick and Horacio asks for Lope to help keep her home, and he nearly skips home saying &quot;she&apos;ll never leave again!&quot; All of this, leading up to a final twist that is very satisfying if extending the tragic dimension of Lope and Tristana, would be soapy and tawdry and, possibly, very standard in other hands. For Bunuel, there&apos;s a lot of personal ground here; I wonder at times if Rey is a little like one of those actors a director of Bunuel&apos;s auteur-stature uses as a means of expressing himself through an actor, or if it&apos;s just because he&apos;s so good at playing wicked AND sympathetic bourgeois. And the mixture of ideas, if not really themes, covering what&apos;s love and over-control, religion, deformity, a free will are potent and exciting even in such subtle and (as Maltin said) serenely filmed territory.\n\nIt&apos;s also a minor triumph for Deneuve, who between this and Belle de jour did some of her best work as an actress for the notorious surrealist. Her character&apos;s continual dream of Lope&apos;s beheaded top dangling from a church tower is the closest we see to a classic surrealist scene, though it&apos;s reminiscent of Los Olvidados as brilliantly expressing one character&apos;s mind-set. Deneuve is up for the challenge of putting up a tough interior and exterior presence; she gets paler towards the end (if this was for real or just a bad print I couldn&apos;t tell), and there&apos;s a lot of pain in her eyes and expression throughout. It&apos;s great work for one of the director&apos;s most subtly demanding works- beneath its conventional framework of a love-triangle story is sorrow and horror at the human condition.",

I am tempted to say that it was actually mundane and generic, to be honest.\n\nStory-wise then it was a predictable ride and director Piapan Choopetch was playing it very safe and following an awfully rigid template of how-to-make-a-horror-movie.\n\nAs for the acting, well there was nothing extraordinary to be seen anywhere throughout the course of the movie. Don&apos;t get me wrong here, the acting wasn&apos;t bad, it just lacked finesse and that extra spice to make it outstanding.\n\nI was mildly entertained, but deterred by the predictability and lack of anything even remotely scary. And I had expected much more from &quot;My Ex&quot; since it is a Thai horror movie. But it was a swing and a miss.\n\nIf you enjoy Asian horror movies, then your time and money is better spent elsewhere.",

Many have been attempts at something different, like the somewhat surreal &quot;in Hell&quot;. This is applaud able, but who really wants a Van Damme movie with little or no action? The Shepherd is a throwback to his 90&apos;s films where plot was minimal and fights and other action scenes took centre stage, where everyone knew they were making a pot boiler and had fun doing it. And thank God, because while no biggie plot wise, this movie delivers everything you&apos;d want from a Van Damme movie. Great if happily familiar martial art fights (it even opens in that old action movie stand by, a diner)lots of guns and explosions, and even a torture scene for our boy. It&apos;s also well directed, starting with a great sense of humor then turning dead serious when it needs to. The last 15 minutes or so are wall to wall boom boom.\n\nFor pure action, for what Van Damme does best, this is absolutely his most entertaining film since he went DTV."

It rips off (poorly) from just about every significant sci-fi film ever made (including BUT NOT LIMITED TO Star Trek, Aliens, Predator, Highlander, Mad Max, Terminator, etc). It was simply named &quot;Terminator II&quot; because of some similar plot ideas to the Schwartzenegger movie, and probably to cash in on the success of the original film.\n\nAs an unofficial sequel, it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to the official one made in 1991, a classic in it&apos;s own right. And as a film, it&apos;s even worse. Summing it up, it&apos;s simply not a good movie. Poor effects, poor acting, and lousy storyline. Skip it and go with the REAL, James Cameron sequel.\n\n*1/2 out of ****"

And thats why it feels so gratis and tedious, because these feministic Initiatives that &quot;Flickorna&quot; are suggesting have already been, more or less, accepted by social standards today.\n\nFigures appear and are gone - interrupted, overheard or obscured by something else. Because here are thousand of things squashed about space. Put togheter with alot of creativity, anger and passion. Three female actors tour with &quot;Lysistrate&quot;, and in a forest there is a living room, in a cinema you throw eggs at Stalin, in a bar the shirts come off, on a street the BridalBrigade forms - and then napalm and serpentines on it. Despite all this commotion Mai Zetterling actually manages to stay steadfast on the directorial cotroll.\n\nMen rule and the world burns, and it is 1968. Men ruled and the world burned 411 BC as well, when Aristophanes wrote his play. To end the 20-year war between Athens and Sparta, Lysistrate makes women swear to deny men sex.\n\nThe theater group heads north. &quot;Lysistrate&quot; is supposed to make people discuss, but no one understands what it is about. World peace and equal conditions are good, but what you want most of all is a sofa group.\n\nThe only mistake is that Zetterling makes a big cluster caused in a cinematographic array of clichés and pre-art that leaves one largely untouched. It may be that pre-art is a stylistic grip in &quot;The Girls&quot;, a way of playfully mixing imagination and reality. But most of the time it is an optional, unintentional parody or superficial image experiment. Nevertheless, its provocative content, its bold and playful form, its humor and warmth, has made it something of a cult.\n\nDue to the death of the actor and director Gunnel Lindblom, I got the chance to see this movie free on SVT.",

      "name": "A Prophetic Serbian Six Feet Under -- and a Masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "The Serbs say this is the best Serbian film ever made, which I think underestimates it -- it may be the best film anyone made in the 1980s. Released in 1982, when Yugoslavia was a functioning state, rather than international shorthand for murder and genocide, it casts a baleful look backward that becomes, in the light of all the subsequent blood, almost unbearably poignant and prophetic. It would be too much if it weren&apos;t constantly, brutally laugh-out-loud funny -- funny even in subtitles, funny as slapstick and deeply classically comic at the same time.\n\nIt is set in the 1930s in a backwater small town in Serbia, where the Topalovic family has its funeral home.. Topalovic women &quot;fade away like flowers&quot; immediately after bearing a boy while the men live on and on -- creating the Marathon reference in the title. In an effervescent scene we meet six generations of Topalovic men, each one of whom mercilessly beats and bullies the younger ones. The film centers on the youngest, the tall and none-too-bright Mirko, lover of movies and Cristina, piano player at the town&apos;s movie house and daughter of the local gangster Billy Python, who supplies the Topalovic home with used coffins dug up and emptied of their previous occupants.\n\nThe action revolves around three events: the death of the very oldest Topalovic, the desire of Mirko&apos;s imbecilic, cowardly and conniving father Lucky to break up the Mirko-Cristina affair and -- and this is resoundingly delicious -- the arrival of sound film in the town, putting Cristina out of a job.\n\nThe writer, Dusan Kovacevic adapted the script  from his own play, and director Slobodan Sijan gets an amazingly good ensemble cast of actors to run the machinery in high gear, flat out. It starts dark and gets darker with crematorium jokes (&quot;the wave of the future&quot;), vintage silent Yugoslav film commercials and clips, and slides, laughing more and more wildly, into violence that flies out of control  The tie to what happened to Serbia only a few years later spins the movie up another level. That the tie is not accidental  is underlined by the opening sequence -- newsreel footage of the assassination in France of the King of Serbia in the early 20s. The wonderful musical theme, raucous and melancholy at the same time is by Zoran Simjanovic. You don&apos;t know me, but do yourself a favor and see this one.",

It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding &apos;rock-video&apos; clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics. But the issue here, as in the much more recent &quot;I walk the Line&quot; or Carpenter&apos;s famed TV Elvis biopic of the same era, is whether the meaning of the performer&apos;s life, in its time and place, as a catalyst for fans&apos; ideals and appreciation, is made manifest in the performance, and this is clearly the case here. We come away from this movie understanding not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I don&apos;t see what else one could want from the film.",

I listened to a review on the radio criticising the movie because of the difficulty of enjoying watching people past their prime in a suspense movie. Maybe the reviewer should have stuck to the Bourne movies to get their kicks. \n\nWell age has nothing to do with it but maturity certainly does. The appealing theme here is that we don&apos;t leave our past so far behind us that it doesn&apos;t exert any major influence on us years later. In fact the more years that pass the more significant the past can become. I suggest you don&apos;t be put off by the negativity of what some others say and see the movie.",

Also this first movie has some porn in it which was toned down in later entries to make it more family-friendly. But the plot in this first movie is great. As in the other movies, we have a great chase after a treasure. Egon has a &quot;plan&quot;, the music is there, and the action takes right on. Actually, one should watch all 13 from 1968-1981 since they are connected. Number 14 was perhaps not so successful though. Anyway, this is one of best comedies ever made, and it is really worth watching for all fans of movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Highlights of this brilliant documentary film must include Deitrich&apos;s opinions of directors she worked with. For example Orson Welles was a genius (`Cross yourself before you mention his name&apos;!) She appeared in `Touch of Evil&apos; without a fee when Welles couldn&apos;t raise finance. Von Sternberg always made things difficult for her so that she would use her brain and learn something whereas Fritz Lang was a `monster&apos; who had her marks chalked on the floor when she arrived on set but his stride was much longer than hers. Then there&apos;s the controversy of Billy Wilder denying Marlene an Oscar opportunity for her superb performance in `Witness for the Prosecution&apos;\n\n`Marlene&apos; includes generous extracts from many of her movies from the silent era in Germany to her final role in `Just a Gigolo&apos; with many gems in between. Deitrich claims never to have watched her own films but director Schell runs excerpts on a video machine and gets her comments.\n\nShe also talks about her contribution to the Allied war effort, the desire of the German people for strong leadership and her contempt for Hitler.\n\nSchell &amp; Deitrich, who appeared together in ` Judgement at Nuremberg&apos; often disagree sharply, and listening to Marlene hold her end up in the exchanges it&apos;s easy to forget that she was 82 years old when this documentary was made in 1983.\n\nSumming up, `Marlene&apos; is a must-see for anyone interested in older movies and her rendition of `See what the boys in the back-room will have&apos; from `Destry Rides Again&apos; alone is worth the money.",

Not that this one is pure depressing, but you&apos;ll get to see a desperate world on the bottom of the mafia and the place where it has its roots. And it isn&apos;t like the godfather.\n\nMy final verdict is an 8 out of 10. There is nothing wrong with this movie, but it hasn&apos;t the 100% perfection for a higher score.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit I&apos;ve never been much of an Eli Roth fan. The original Cabin Fever was a pretty bad movie but I wouldn&apos;t even recommend this film to Eli Roth fans, as it is a pretty pointless remake. Fans of the original probably should stay away.\n\nIf there was one positive thing about the original film, it was that it had that low budget charm to it. There&apos;s something about low budget horror films that I like and Cabin Fever had that. However, this remake does away with that charm as it obviously had a higher budget. A higher budget doesn&apos;t always mean a better film, though.\n\nThe acting in this remake is atrocious and the dialogue is even worse. The characters are all underdeveloped stereotypes that you really don&apos;t care about at all. Nearly all the scenes of the original are redone shot-for-shot, but they&apos;re handled in a much messier manner. There are a few minor differences, such as the &quot;party man&quot; cop character is now played by a female, for some reason.\n\nAs for positives, there aren&apos;t many. The cinematography was decent and the gore and makeup effects were pretty damn good actually. Some of the music was alright. But that&apos;s about it. I don&apos;t see why this film had to be made.\n\nOverall, this is a shallow remake of a bad, low budget horror film from 2002. If you&apos;ve never seen Cabin Fever but plan on watching it, I&apos;d go with the original, as it is the better of the two. However, that&apos;s not saying much, as they&apos;re both pretty shitty. If you are a fan of the original, you probably won&apos;t like it much. But you might watch it anyway just to compare the two. I wouldn&apos;t pay much to see it, though. Maybe rent it if you get the chance.\n\n3/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is something very interesting - a movie recently discovered and restored from Croatian State Archive, the very first Croatian feature movie with a sound. Yes, I know - Hollywood was there already some 20 years before and even neighbors like Hungary, Austria or Italy had their own movie stars and industries while poor little provincial Croatia limped way behind them, however some time in mid-1940s there was enough enthusiasm, energy and inspiration to have this first ever Croatian movie finally made.\n\nThe most interesting of all is the fact that this movie was for almost half a century completely forgotten and believed lost. Generations were born and died without ever knowing about it. The main reason behind it was timing - it was filmed around 1943. and had a premiere next year, with biggest names from politics and public life arriving in the cinema. Apparently it was a huge success and people loved it,even for simple fact that this was first local, home-made cinema feature and not some little short documentary. However, as WW2 ended and new political regime took over, everything from 1940-1945 was seen as embarrassment and collaboration with previous enemy-state. From now Yugoslavia started as a new country and in the schools we all learned about the first Yu-movie &quot;Slavica&quot; (made shortly after the war) but nobody had ever mentioned that Croatia already had a movie hit earlier - this movie was finally unearthed and lovingly restored on DVD with some nice extra clips, photos and even short documented newsreels from premiere on Easter 1944.\n\nApparently the movie had been already screened in cinemas and shown on TV several times recently but I am always away traveling so this is all new to me - I saw DVD on &quot;Interliber&quot; book fair and immediately purchased it, not expecting much from some old historical document. It is supposed to be movie biography of famous Croatian composer Vatroslav Lisinski who is remembered as writer of our first opera and the biggest concert hall in Zagreb is named after him, but to be honest nobody knows much about him beyond this fact. We know the titles of his operas (&quot;Love and Malice&quot;, &quot;Porin&quot;) but how did they actually sound nobody can tell. So I decided to check it out last night and to my biggest surprise this is what I saw.\n\nMovie is surprisingly beautiful visually - not only considering the time when it was made (middle of WW2) but also that it was basically made by people who had to improvise on each step, overcoming technical difficulties and trying to make something out of non-existing local cinematography. Director Oktavijan Miletić comes across as eager movie fan who valiantly tries to prettify what is truthfully half-baked idea - there are many beautiful scenes filmed around Zagreb&apos;s historical old parts (with palaces, squares and churches), lovely period costumes and quaint panoramic views of flowery fields. Unfortunately the script is all wrong, presenting poor struggling artist as a overtly naive, meek and humble to the point that viewers find him annoying little mouse (he constantly worries is he &quot;worthy&quot; and needs to be pushed and poked into action by friend Alberto triga who is far superior character in the movie). As for acting, it is all very wooden unfortunately - main role was given to certain Branko poljar who looks like Lisinski but can&apos;t act to save his life and comes across as poor country relative lost in intrigues of big city. In fact, everybody looks quite unconvincing from today&apos;s perspective, except supporting roles of energetic Alberto triga (Veljko Maričić) who constantly pushes Lisinski into getting on with composing and lovely real-life opera singer Srebrenka Jurinac as countess who sang and promoted Lisinski&apos;s work on the stage (Jurinac later made a nice international career in classical world under name Sena Jurinac). It would be unnecessary nitpicking to list all that is wrong with this movie today - the final result looks really naive and amateurish in many ways, however this is exactly what it was, labor of love for its creators who had no big companies backing them or superior technical gadgets to work with - as a historical document it is however a truly heart-warming little masterpiece that has to be taken for what it was, specially considering that none of the artist (including the director) was later given chance in Yugoslavia when future decades would be focused on WW2 spectacles, heroic sagas about partisans and such. We all grew up watching partisans fighting Nazis, bridges falling and villages burning but none of us ever knew about &quot;Lisinski&quot; and this little romantic biography of 19. century composer. Until now.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank D. Gilroy adapted his unsuccessful two-act play about an aging Las Vegas showgirl (Elizabeth Taylor) who picks up the piano player (Warren Beatty) in a cocktail lounge one night after work. He&apos;s a gambler who can&apos;t be trusted with money; she&apos;s on the rebound after her married lover returned to his wife. It&apos;s an oddly old-fashioned tale with nothing particularly dramatic in the set-up; the pressing issues seem to be her loneliness and his need to win big. The critics pounced on the picture, not because of Gilroy&apos;s writing or George Stevens&apos; direction or the performances--but because of the budget ($11M), inflated by Taylor&apos;s insistence the film&apos;s interiors be shot in Paris, France (so she could be close to husband Richard Burton). Despite the wigs and insistent soft-focus close-ups, Taylor comes close to finding an interesting character here; she isn&apos;t convincing as a showgirl (shot from the shoulders up), and she doesn&apos;t exactly sizzle with Beatty, but she&apos;s easily bruised and vulnerable, and lovely when she needs to be. Beatty (filling in for Frank Sinatra, who had prior commitments) plays his dryly sarcastic role with a touch of eccentricity; he&apos;s supposed to be younger and reckless, a wild card, but some scenes--like a hopeless fishing excursion at Lake Mead (using a green screen)--are beyond his control. The color scheme of Taylor&apos;s apartment (where we&apos;re stuck most of the time)--in avocado green and gold--isn&apos;t glamorous, but the rest of the movie is. Cinematographer Henri Decae gives the picture a touch of fake-Vegas sparkle which is appealing, and all the exteriors on-location look terrific (Las Vegas becomes a big, shiny department store). What doesn&apos;t work is the back-end of Gilroy&apos;s second act, wherein Taylor hesitates over Beatty&apos;s marriage proposal. Their conversation is supposed to be a dissection of why men and women marry, what keeps them together and why the participants eventually get restless--but it goes on and on, grinding the movie to a halt. Had Stevens (whose last film this was) given us something more--a final visual zinger or a twist--&quot;The Only Game In Town&quot; may actually be worth a second glance. As it is, it fades in the stretch as well as in the memory. **1/2 from ****",

If you like &quot;Il Prezzo di Potere&quot; (The Price of Power), you will probably like this movie.\n\nThe music score is not one of the great ones, but it is adequate and appropriate for a spaghetti western.\n\nJohn Ireland is great as the greedy villain who tries to extort money from the North as well as the South by holding the inventor of the machine gun and his prototype weapon for ransom. This is the best performance I&apos;ve seen from him in a spaghetti western. Robert Woods also does a great job here. He is almost as good in this film as he was in &quot;Black Jack.&quot; \n\nEuro-western fans should take notice. See this movie if you can find it!",

      "name": "The Problem of Horror-Comedy",
      "reviewBody": "Horror-comedy is something very difficult to do. So many films tried this blend of genres in the 1980s and failed miserably: Ghoulies 3, TerrorVision, pretty much anything Troma ever did. And only a few truly brilliant filmmakers were able to really succeed at this: Frank Henenlotter, Peter Jackson, Dan O&apos;Bannon. This film is rare in that it falls generally between these two extremes. It&apos;s often very funny, and occasionally creative, but its obvious self-awareness can sometimes be trying.\n\nTwo brothers operate a vegetarian restaurant and secretly serve human flesh to their customers. They have an uncle (or what remains of him) who helps them to prepare for the feast of Sheetar by compiling a perfect woman out of assorted body parts. The bones of the plot are borrowed lovingly from H.G. Lewis&apos;s Blood Feast, but the majority of the film is pretty unique.\n\nUnfortunately, because of their similarities, Blood Diner will always be compared to Blood Feast, and Blood Diner is just not that caliber of a film. Blood Feast brought on the sickening and sometimes too-real gore; Blood Diner&apos;s gore is cartoonish and cheap-looking. Blood Feast was technically flawed, but had enthusiastic performances and unmindfully creative camera work; Blood Diner is slick (as far as 80s horror-comedies go) and very self-conscious, but ultimately soulless in its execution.\n\nThe real key to a successful horror-comedy is that little dash of sincerity. You can have your jokes and fun, but a little sincere strangeness (or just plain scares) makes the film all the more real. If you like horror-comedy, and you&apos;ve already seen Basket Case, Frankenhooker, Return of the Living Dead, Dead Alive, Re-Animator, and Brain Damage, you may want to give this a shot. It&apos;s sure as hell better than Troll 2.",

Then we&apos;re treated to exteriors of the Mannering house which are nothing more than Thomas Kincade- style paintings. (Virtually the whole film was shot on a sound stage, except for some rear projections.)\n\nThe plot itself is clichéd, but decently &quot;executed.&quot; The casting is a problem, with Joan Crawford at age 60 trying to be the hypotenuse in a love triangle between 50-year-old John Ireland and some young bimbo (or we should say, ex-bimbo). Not much choice there. The two teenage girls are straight out of 60s sitcom land, and the younger sister joins the ranks of &quot;most annoying child actors.&quot; There are some tense moments, including a ripoff of the shower scene from &quot;Psycho&quot; (except with a naked man instead of Janet Leigh).\n\nAnd since we&apos;re already knee-deep in 60s sitcoms with the trite score and giggly teenaged actors, we&apos;re given an ending that would have been right in place on Dobie Gillis or the Patty Duke Show.

No doubt -this one is masterpiece and has perfect plot and rather good for eastern Europe 80s special effects.\n\nwww.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab",

I&apos;ve followed the work of József Gallai on previous movies and he never disappoints. He is an amazing writer and director and has a great eye for compelling storylines.\n\nThis movie takes the real world phenomenon of &quot;skyquakes&quot; (go ahead and Google it; fascinating stuff) and puts a compelling sci-fi twist on it by creatively offering a possible fictional explanation.\n\nThe mystery and tension builds with some impressive dialogue driven plot by the two main protagonists played by Laura Saxon &amp; Laura Ellen Wilson. The chemistry between them is impressive and makes for a compelling mystery that pulls in the viewer. I would be very surprised if they don&apos;t get some kind of award for their performance.\n\nI would have easily given this movie 10 stars except for a couple of points. First, the plot took a slightly religious turn that seemed unnecessary given the previous setup. There were also a couple of spots during the movie where it was not clear why the two lead actresses had chosen to take certain actions. That being said, the character development was phenomenal and good use was made of Tom Sizemore and Robert LaSardo in support roles to strengthen the mystery that the two main protagonists were attempting to solve.\n\nAll in all, well worth checking it out if you see it doing the film festival circuit or if you have the option to rent or purchase it. You&apos;ll thank yourself later!",

Peter is dating flighty lead dancing Rebecca (Marley Shelton) who lives under her domineering director mother. One day, Rebecca reveals that she and Dag had a fling while she was touring in Europe. Dag, Halley, and Peter all break up as they find other relationships. Dag flirts with unstable waitress Paula (Marisa Tomei) who is in love Peter&apos;s commercial as a peanut butter mascot eagle. Halley has a fling with Andre (Taye Diggs) while staying at Rebecca&apos;s apartment. Peter meets Colleen (Sarita Choudhury) and then their plane crashes.\n\nIt&apos;s always fascinating to see these established actors in their earlier less-known work. Suddenly, Peter Dinklage shows up in a weird one-off role. Tomei is playing a psycho. There is a lot of wackiness but it doesn&apos;t strike my fancy. It&apos;s harder to laugh when the lead annoys me and Dag annoys me. I&apos;m not a fan Eldard although he&apos;s usually pretty good as the annoying sidekick or the pathetic villain. It&apos;s not good when he&apos;s the lead. I also find the animated flashes really bad and unnecessary. I&apos;m only interested in Halley and Peter but even there, the interest fades rather quickly. Peter pulling down his pants is a great move but his character turns bland. I love Sedgwick but when she lets in Andre, I just don&apos;t think that any New Yorker would do that without at least calling Rebecca. In the end, none of these characters intrigue me and other than the pants drop, none of it struck me as being funny.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always loved this film.This film has a lot of truly fascinating character development. Dr. Aziz goes from the kind of easily intimidated and emotionally battered employee that the British must have loved to have as a compliant colonial subject, to a frightened defendant who has had injustice snatch him from his lonely but well-ordered life, to a bitter and empowered man who thinks identifying with the plight of his fellow Indians means he must abandon all friendships with westerners, in particular that of the compassionate Richard Fielding. Sir Alec Guiness plays the minor but important role of Professor Godbole, a man whose beliefs puzzle Fielding. When Aziz has been unjustly accused of raping Adela Quested, a British woman, Fielding wants to mount some kind of campaign, to perform some kind of action on Aziz&apos; behalf. Godbole calmly insists that although he cares about Aziz very much, nothing he or anyone does will matter - the whole thing has been predetermined. This is one of the issues that plays like background music in the film - that of Western views of human action and divine purpose working synergistically versus Eastern views on the same themes - karma versus Christian endeavor. I truly believe 1984 was a year in which the Academy got it right - Amadeus was indeed the best picture. However, this film is a photo-finish second and I highly recommend it.",

WB movies back in the day were more often than not defined by their supporting players. They had a premium stable of actors to choose from and many times they&apos;re more enjoyable to watch than the leads.\n\nDavis has a lot of fun with this role and, while her comedic talents were always so-so, she shines here. This is also one of the movies where she looks prettiest and curviest. One dress in particular fits her just right.\n\nThe movie isn&apos;t perfect. It drags a bit more than a screwball comedy should. Davis and Cagney, while having nice comedic timing, don&apos;t really have much romantic chemistry. So the inevitable conclusion to a film like this might be a bit hard for some to buy. Still, I recommend it to any Bette Davis or James Cagney fan. Also to any fan of WB films from the 1930s and 40s.",

I saw this movie when i was 16 years old,and had no idea that chimpanzees were so strong. After watching the film, i studied a book at the library about them,and was amazed at the things they can do. Most people don&apos;t realize just how large they can be. Many chimpanzees in the zoo can weigh 175lbs as adults, which is the same as a human. They are over a foot shorter than we are, but they have denser bone and muscle,which makes them heavier. Interesting animals."

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed Vertical Limit. One thing I would have done differently, as a director, is to eliminate the explosives. Blowing a hole at the top of the crevass that your friends and family are at the bottom of is folly, and even if you do feel the need to bring explosives (in avalanche country), use something relatively stable, like dynamite.\n\nDynamite would have been readily available, for it is used to mine Himalayan salt in Pakistan. Certainly, the man with the millions of dollars could have afforded some. The exclusion of explosives from the scenes would have contributed to a more believable Himalayan adventure (think Into Thin Air).\n\nThe story line was good, and I appreciated the strong, complex dynamics and connections between the brother and sister, and between the two siblings and the rescue team leader. While Vertical Limit strove to expose the harsh realities of technical climbing (especially at K2), however, it lost some steam by being very lax in re-creating the conditions that would have been met by the climbers, even at K2&apos;s Base Camp at 18,645 feet.\n\nNo one was even wearing hats at the alcohol-ridden &quot;barbecue&quot; at Base Camp, the night before the climb. It would have been blisteringly cold, between -20 and -50 farenheit. No professional climber would have been drinking alcohol at that time.\n\nOn the mountain, in the raging storm, the climbers did not even have the sense to pull the Cord-Locs on their hoods tight: Snow would have accumulated inside their hoods and parkas, then melting. There were some scenes when protective face masks were used, and that was excellent.\n\nChris O&apos;Donnell&apos;s character makes a terrific leap onto a snowy cliff face. I am not entirely certain that the jump would have been possible in real-life, but just maybe. They should have made the jump less-ambitious and more believeable. \n\nAlthough I am glad that there were not one but two women in the rescue team, in reality, they would have not been allowed: Women just don&apos;t have the brute force necessary to haul 200-pound guys down the mountain (or up on a rope).\n\nWhile I am tempted to say that it is unrealistic that the veteran and renowned ascent team leader and National Geographic photographer (also a highly-experienced climber) could be cajoled into continuing the ascent after the severe storm warning had been issued to them, we have seen bad decisions in the past by real-life alpine team leaders,culminating to disaster.\n\nAlthough it may seem that I am being very critical of Vertical Limit, my score of 8 shows that I am willing to forgive the sins that Hollywood felt compelled to commit. The strong inter-personal dynamics, memorable characters, strong story line in-general, and clear, bold decision making in the screenplay made this film worth watching. Heroism is always a welcome theme in the movies I watch, and in Vertical Limit, everyone&apos;s a hero in his or her own way.\n\nScott Glen&apos;s character as the rescue team leader and sage mountaineer was superb.",

That is quite a punch right there. \n\nThe movie really grabbed me emotionally with repeated small acts of kindness, not just from the father but from everyone in his community. You will need a box of Kleenex. The father has totally dedicated his life to his son&apos;s well being. His gentle kindness transforms everyone around him and brings out the best in them.\n\nThe movie completely worked until the very end when Dad tried to create a simple religious myth to explain his impending death to his son. It was bathos. It spoiled the end of the movie for me. The movie suddenly went Disney on me. It was just too goofy. I suppose I could reframe it as insane last ditch desperation.\n\nIt has an intense bitter-sweet ending.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the play of the same name, Miss Firecracker stars Holly Hunter repeating her off-Broadway stage role, along with Mary Steenburgen, Tim Robbins, Alfre Woodward, Scott Glenn, and Ann Wedgeworth.\n\nThis film is about a small Southern town and its beauty pageant, which takes place on the 4th of July.\n\nIt&apos;s not a coincidence that the playwright, Beth Henley, has the pageant held on Independence Day, because that&apos;s what the film is really about. Independence from the opinions of others, independence from the ties of what someone has set as a standard of beauty, the independence to explore and find yourself.\n\nCarnelle Scott is a young local woman, and she believes that if she can be Miss Firecracker, she will receive the validation she has always craved, and then leave the town and go onto success elsewhere. She has no friends in town, and her reputation is not the best. She has a boyfriend who adores her (Glenn) but it isn&apos;t enough.\n\nOne inspiration for her is her cousin, Elain, and there, Carnelle doesn&apos;t see the forest for the trees. Elain is a past Miss Firecracker. She&apos;s not only totally self-involved, but her life is built around her past victories. To Carnelle, Elain&apos;s life is perfect.\n\nElain&apos;s brother is the volatile Delmount (Robbins) who wants to sell the house Carnelle lives in. He&apos;ll split the money with her. He was released from a mental institution; Elain and her husband refused to take him in.\n\nSince this is the last year Carnelle is eligible, she decides to go for the pageant in a big way. And one thing she wants is to wear the bright red evening gown that Elain wore when she won; she has even dyed her hair bright red to match it.\n\nCarnelle&apos;s major support comes from Popeye Jackson (Woodward), a young woman who wears Coke bottle glasses and works in a dress shop. Popeye helps Carnelle be outfitted for the pageant, and develops a crush on Delmount.\n\nThough the character of Carnelle is the focus of the film, the one to be emulated is Popeye - kind, helpful, and uncaring about people&apos;s appearance. She&apos;s more interested in what&apos;s inside. And hopefully along the way this is what Carnelle learns as well.\n\nVery sweet film and Hunter is dynamite as Carnelle. The movie is bigger than the play, which may not have been the best option for it. The direction by Thomas Schlamme, who has found great success in television, is only so-so. It should be a tighter production.\n\nDon&apos;t miss Carnelle&apos;s part in the talent competition.",

      "reviewBody": ".... is how journalist Martin Bashir introduced this documentary on this one time superstar , so right away I was expecting lashings of irony and I got it and a whole lot more though I have to admit this is sometimes an uneasy watch .\n\nA lot of people have come on here to put the boot into Bashir saying he set MJ up . I`m not too keen on Bashir myself since I`ve always found him something of a lightweight reporter but Bashir is blameless in getting Michael to say and do things on screen , everything weird , camp and disturbing from this documentary is down to Jackson not Bashir\n\n Michael goes into a store - Which has been closed by request from MJ`s entourage - and buys millions of dollars worth of junk . Bashir`s fault ?\n\n Michael and Martin drive around a track in go-carts with Jackson screaming &quot; Oh stop it you`re cheating &quot; in the most laughably camp voice I`ve ever heard . Bashir`s fault ? \n\nMichael tells us his hobby is climbing trees and it`s his favourite thing in his life . Bashir`s fault ? \n\nMichael takes his weirdly named children out for a walk with masks on their face . Bashir`s fault ? \n\nMichael invites a 12 year old boy who`s suffering from cancer to stay on his ranch alone . This is the same Michael Jackson who ten years ago was hit by allegations of sexually molesting a young boy on his ranch and who instead of going to court to clear his name and be proven innocent of the allegations decided to give the alleged victim a multi million pound compensation deal . How is any of this Bashir`s fault ? I should also point out that as I`m writing this review Jackson`s ranch has just been raided by police earlier today \n\nThe only criticism I have with Bashir is that he didn`t ask the most obvious question which is this : &quot; Michael if you`re an Afro-American then why do all your children resemble one hundred per cent white Europeans ? &quot;",

The actors and actresses were really excellent: Brigitte Aubert (Denise Lambert) Sylvie (Mademoiselle Perrier), Daniel Ivernel (Georges Forestier), Paul Frankeur (Milou) Marie-France (La petite Colett Malingret) and François Périer (Narrator). Also &quot;Sous le ciel de Paris&quot; is a masterpiece of photography,The cinematographer Nicolas Hayer was also the cinematographer of &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; (1943). Another important point: &quot;Sous le ciel de Paris&quot; is a tale narrated with tenderness and humour by François Périer. Finally there is one song: &quot;Sous le ciel de Paris&quot;,music by Hubert Giraud,lyrics of Jean Dréjac and sung by Jean Bretonnière: very great and famous French singer have sung once this nice song (Yves Montand,Juliette Gréco, Édith Piaf, etc).",

Chavez ends up killing the employer but is seen by a voodoo priestess who casts a spell, a curse, on him that turns him into a murderous Gorilla. Barney and Dina end up married but with lots of problems. Police Commissioner Taro (Chaney) is on the trail to find out the answers. The question is: Is Chavez&apos; transformation into a Gorilla real or all in his mind.\n\nRaymond Burr is good in this role - convincing, Barbra Payton does well as a woman tormented, Lon Chaney Jr makes a good police commissioner - so the film is overall fun to watch.\n\nThis film is not nearly as bad as the critics say it is - it&apos;s actually interesting. There are some intense moments and it&apos;s a good ending. If you like movies where one of the characters is transformed into a creature and film concerning voodoo then you might like &apos;Bride of the Gorilla&apos;.\n\n6.5/10",

To call it a &apos;comedy&apos; is a big stretch, nothing at all is funny in that silly movie. It looks like a high school production, and its amazing how some of the actors agreed to be in it. The humor is juvenile, and it is just pure silly. I can&apos;t see it even as a cult movie at midnight.... There are really not enough negative comments to say to describe this total waste of time, and money...how they got the funding is a mystery...did anyone read that? Save time, money and stamps before you go see this ONE....."

      "reviewBody": "This is the first Larry Buchanan movie I ever viewed, and sadly wasn&apos;t the last. I only bothered checking it out after seeing the trailer in &quot;Fantastic Dinosaurs of the Movies&quot; many years ago as a kid. I found the deceptive box art and melodramatic trailer even more entertaining than the film itself. I haven&apos;t even bothered watching this again for almost twenty years, but I remember enough to write this review.\n\nThe main story goes like this. At &quot;Loch Ness&quot;, a team of scientists led by Pratt seek out to find Nessie, but instead discover eggs laid by the monster. Unsurprisingly, Nessie gets mad and begins rampaging around the area, searching for her egg. Meanwhile, another scientist named George Sanderson (Sandy Kenyon) recruits longtime Loch Ness resident Jack Stewart (Doc Livingston) to prove Nessie exists. I guess they ran out of money, because the rushed ending involved a crashed Luftwaffe plane being destroyed as a cover-up. There&apos;s a sub-plot or two thrown in that I couldn&apos;t be bothered to follow, like a crazy ax-wielding Scot living on a non-existent island in the middle of Loch Ness who tries to kill some teens.\n\nDespite being a &quot;horror&quot; movie, the monster effects were too cheesy to frighten anyone. Nessie is a ridiculously fake looking, paper-mâché puppet head mounted on a long pole with a barely functioning mouth. Her roar was simply a shameless recycle of the TIE fighter sound from Star Wars. Even her misty breath and nostrils bubbling underwater didn&apos;t look too impressive.\n\nThe attack scenes are just as dull. The underwater attacks are too close up and fast paced to make anything out, and the night attacks are so dark, you can barely see what&apos;s happening. Even when she kills in broad daylight, it&apos;s laughable. She apparently kills a couple of soldiers by nudging them with her snout. There&apos;s only one mildly disturbing death scene when Nessie dragged some guy in a sleeping bag into the water. Other than that, nothing in this movie was scary.\n\nThe acting is predictably bad, since all of the &quot;actors/actresses&quot; are all just members of Buchanans family. And I&apos;ve heard enough legitimate Scottish accents to tell them apart from the obviously fake ones from the cast. And that&apos;s not all that solidifies the fact this didn&apos;t even take place at Loch Ness, but at Lake Tahoe, California. You can easily tell by the out of place California redwoods seen several times. Any other attempt to pass off California as Scotland fails miserably, like with the Scottish soldiers wearing clearly outdated uniforms and armed with M16s instead of the correct L1A1s. You get the idea.\n\nThis film is so low-budget and cheesy, yet you could say it&apos;s so bad, it&apos;s good. Otherwise, it&apos;s just a dime a dozen budget monster movie worth a single watch on a lazy day.",

The second type are often able to supply all the low budget deficiencies developing new ideas, trying new methods. Farther from the huge production there&apos;s much more freedom, which is the very basic element of every artistic form. Of course this last definition doesn&apos;t fit very well to this M.M.Tarantini&apos;s creation: I don&apos;t think we can call art such an &quot;horrible masterpiece&quot;, but for sure here we&apos;ve got something that doesn&apos;t respect any kind of rule, something that has no limits. If nowadays producers and directors have stamped in their minds movies like this as examples of making good entertainment we would get rid of many cinematographic abortions. 1/10 on the trash (&quot;italian B movies&quot;)scale means &quot;masterwork&quot;.

As the story progresses, the film breaks boundaries further &amp; demonstrates an exceptionally sharp sensibility -- but fairly much returns to the standards for the climactic scene.\n\nWhile not a Scorsese or Tarantino masterpiece, this film is very highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) \n\nReview: How bout this? George Clooney in a different role? Yep. For once he tries something different.\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the &quot;Titty Twister&quot;. That&apos;s where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.\n\nThis movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn&apos;t at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that&apos;s the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.\n\nLike I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well. This just happens to be more gritty than the Evil Dead.\n\nThe Last Word: I like it. Good for your October needs. Did I forget Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin? They are here as well. Good bloody fun.",

I can remember like yesterday seeing the Big Boys, the Dicks, DK and Black Flag at Club Foot, the punk venue. It was a great and unique time. I have aged, but still consider myself a punk at heart. However, I was rather letdown by this film. It seems like the guy wanted to make this definitive documentary over the punk scene in the early &apos;80s, but half the people he asked to interview turned him down. The most glaring flaw with this film is the omission of the Dead Kennedys. Yes, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were huge during that time, but NOBODY came close to rivaling DK, they were it. Yet, there is nothing in the film about them, nothing. Fear is also ignored and so many other greats are just barely touched on. Yet, we get a ton of stuff on the Cro Mags and TSOL? Look, I know that a documentary filmmaker can only use the sources available to him, but it seems that the sources that were available to him (minus Henry Rollins and Keith Morris) were rather small in comparison to other giants like Jello Biafra and Lee Ving. Moreover, there was not enough music in the film. It opens with a nice Bad Brains&apos; cut and montage and then they kind of go away from anymore montages. As someone that experienced the scene firsthand, I just kind of felt it was a rather thin and sloppy look at a very interesting time. Moreover, they drop Husker Du&apos;s name a lot, but then never explore anything about them. The guy could have made a better documentary, a much better one. And he could have shown how the punk scene influenced the creation of future bands like Social Distortion, the Replacments, etc.. And how about a shout-out to the freaking Ramones!?",

      "reviewBody": "How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas life for the time period. Consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk at bars nightly, get married to settle a fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. They dont make them anymore. It seems current films are always about people with lots of money, they live in huge homes, drive expensive cars and don&apos;t work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete&apos;s sake !\n\nAnyway, I watch it at least once a week. No kidding. I have dissected this movie from end to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are split up - he amicably honks and waves, she flips him the bird - he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off.\n\nBuds mom calls him approx. 18 hours after he gets into town, on a Sunday, to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid(x2), with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him.\n\n&quot;You all live like pigs&quot; Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary ? Could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ? God I love that !\n\nSissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked the crap out of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes ? Oh yeah, didnt you beat my husband up the other night, so let&apos;s get this lesson goin&apos;, to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one Bud and Sissy&apos;s many fights, which by the way all take place in public - in Gilley&apos;s !\n\nThe Wedding reception picture taking session (oh the humanity !) could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. &quot;My legs are sweatin&apos; momma&quot;\n\nIn conclusion, you don&apos;t put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology. It is a documentary of real life.\n\nI only wish there was a director&apos;s cut....",

The only skin that you&apos;ll see is her naked back a few times.\n\nAlthough the plot unfolds very slowly, that&apos;s the point. There are some mental health and abuse issues here, and in real-time most similar interactions would never progress as far as this movie does by the end, and most likely far less successfully as the eventual turnout of the plot.\n\nInteresting, intriguing, not Oscar-candidate but a strong entry especially considering the topic(s) involved."

Those comparing it with Hollywood standards such as the density of the plot, the stunts or &apos;the sex scene&apos; would be wise to take another look. Such standards cannot be applied here. Lelouch plays with colors, objects, and our natural capacity for associative memory to tell us what is neither written nor spoken. The main actors, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk Aimée master the art of expressing the message. Dialogs are far from poor, but the meaning sometimes has to be found in their tone, their breaks, their pace or, again, the characters&apos; play. What would be cinema for if these were useless ?",

      "reviewBody": "I really liked Timothy Dalton as Bond. I really thought the guy did a great job. The Living Daylights was an excellent Bond thriller, more in line with Dr No and From Russia With Love in tone and style, but with Licence To Kill you can tell that Broccoli decided to compete with the big boys with this action packed spectacular that aims high and scores. What we have here is Bond with spectacular action scenes and a more nastier steak with regards to the violence that is  more in line with Hollywood action blockbusters than with quintessential British spies. This is why the film works. Licence To Kill is much more darker than any of the Bond films that has come before, and after the silliness of the Moore era, that was what  this franchise needed. Why have world domination craving villains when you can just p*ss Bond off, big time. Having Felix Lieter maimed and his wife killed on their wedding day is inspired and immediately puts the film on a darker streak. The script here is very strong as we watch a darker more violent Bond infiltrate the bad guy&apos;s lifestyle and then proceed to work from there.\n\n Don&apos;t make any mistakes this is not a Bond film that would be broadcast during a Bank Holiday afternoon. What we have here is a film that is graphically violent. Check out the head explosion scene or the nasty incidents involving sharks. Having Bond on the revenge path makes for a more interesting tale than just another villain trying to take over the world. The more personal element fits in with this more darker Bond. Dalton really rises to the occasion here and ensures that he will be remembered as a fine actor who played the part of James Bond. The ice cool look of anger as he dumps a bad guy into a shark tank with a case fool of money is fantastic as is his reaction to finding Lieter&apos;s dead wife. It may not be said, buy OHMSS is being referenced. Helping Dalton along the way is a great support cast. Robert Davi is superb as Franz Sanchez, without doubt the nastiest Bond villain there has ever been. We have two Bond girls too. Talisa Soto is beautifully sultry, but Carey Lowell just pips her to the post as Pam Bouvier who really gives Bond a run for his money. Another great casting point is an increased role for Q. Desmond Lewellyn appears here more than he ever has done before, helping out in the mission that makes one wonder the Bond writers never thought of it before, or why they never did it after.\n\nLicence To Kill is classic Bond. Purists may give of with the more American touch to the narrative (you just know that any theatrical trailer is crying out for voice over man to go &quot;this time it&apos;s personal&quot;), but the more darker narrative suits the film and it shows that Dalton was a good Bond no matter what his critics say. With some of the most spectacular action sequences at the time, this is a genuine Bond classic.\n\nShaken and stirred most definitely.",

It was an unnerving mystery that sucked me in and genuinely surprised me. \n\nPeter Coyote&apos;s portrayal of a strange motel owner was my favorite part of the film. I&apos;ve seen Coyote in a lot of movies, and this has got to be the most interesting role I&apos;ve seen him play yet. You&apos;re never sure if you want to love him or fear him, and that ends up working perfectly for the plot. \n\nDeepwater had a lot of creepy, stylish, music-video type moments. The camera work was beautiful, and once you get to the end of the movie, the style of these sequences makes even more sense. I didn&apos;t feel like these scenes took away from the dramatic moments which were the core of the movie. \n\nThe director answered questions afterwards, and I was surprised to hear him talking about how low the budget was. He described some of what he would have done with a bigger budget, but I found myself wondering if the small budget helped force them to really focus the story. It&apos;s too late this year, but after seeing Deepwater I&apos;m going to make sure I see more films at next year&apos;s festival.",

The execution would have been so much better. I can only think they relied too much on improvising and whoever they could presumably talk into participating while they were at Cannes, rather than scripting it all and making it from scratch as Allen would have. Much of the acting isn&apos;t quite of a high enough standard either, but none the less its still and enjoyable film to watch.\n\nTrading Places is another film that comes to mind when watching this - along with The Player - and ensemble pieces like Best In Show and This Is Spinal Tap. All of them cover either similar themes, or were made in a similar way, but yielded a better result. Perhaps the difference with Best in Show and Spinal Tap is that their makers had a firmer idea of what each scene was meant to cover before it was improvised, and from the outset they had a stronger script/structure - this film seemed to lack a little in that regard, as well as having some average acting. I thought Sy Lerner&apos;s character was a bit confusing too - at the start he seems to be a bit of a schmuck past his best days, yet he still seems to carry a lot of clout and when he starts wheeling and dealing.",

He&apos;s an unbelievable athelete and in my opinion the greatest all rounder in the history of wrestling but outside the the ring he falls apart and cannot be taken seriously.\n\nThe acting is beyond awful, the special effects are preschool and the storyline is recycled. There is nothing good to say about this film and I hope all involved are ashamed of themselves."
