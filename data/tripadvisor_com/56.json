    "description": "Come See The Fun Side of Seattle! The Henry Immersive Experience is a truly unique sightseeing tour. Hop aboard the most colorful tour bus you have ever been on and get ready to explore Seattle through the eyes of artists. As we visit over 20 colorful murals painted by Henry we will learn more about the artist, the development of several of Seattle's most iconic neighborhoods and how art is central to the vibrancy of our city. Our dedicated tour guide will provide an entertaining and slightly educational adventure that will be fun for the whole family. Along the way we will visit the \"Hidden Wizard Gallery\" to view a collection of Henry's most creative canvas paintings, see two more murals and browse through a selection of Henry merchandise. There will be a couple of stops along the way to grab a tasty beverage, take a break if needed and get up and close with some of Henry's art for that photo that will keep you smiling all year long.

I’m a longtime Seattleite, & happily surprised by hidden places I didn’t know existed even in my own neighborhoods. in which I lived.  The day was bright & beautiful & my artist friend said it was the best present she’d ever had (at 62 y. o.).  Highly recommend …. go!!!"

The tour guide, Roman, is a great narrator and told us so much about the art scene in Seattle and other cities. The murals are all very different -- from decorating a house, fence, retail venue, restaurant, garden and even retaining walls downtown. I think my favorite mural was a walrus riding a bicycle. The bus is very comfortable and full of Henry's art. Look for the giraffe that is hiding behind the driver.  I purchased a picture and mementoes at Henry's gallery. I'll definitely take the tour again."

Very fun way and unique way to learn about the history of murals in general in Seattle and see the neighborhoods from a different perspective. My dad is disabled and the driver was very considerate when pulling over for stops. The stops were well timed at a brewery and at a quick drink/food spot. I’ve recommended this experience to my friends as a great activity with visiting parents. "

We visited dozens of the artist's murals throughout the city, as well as his gallery/gift shop. His caricatures are sure to bring a smile to your face and he makes Sasquatch look like someone you'd love to meet. And you can visit some primo watering holes to wet your lips and fill your belly. If you are in Seattle, and have a few hours, you can't go wrong with this tour."

He did a great job of explaining the reason for the characters in each mural and also explained the history of the Seattle neighborhoods.  There were two pleasant surprises not mentioned in the tour description.  #1:  Tour stops at Ruebens Brewery  to sample beer, use the bathroom, and look at a fabulous mural inside.  #2:  We stopped at Flatstick Pub to look at more Henry art and eat lunch. We didn’t expect a lunch stop,  Our tour ended at 3 pm instead of 2 pm.  Which was no problem for our group.  But if you take this tour, I recommend not having an appointment immediately after 2 pm."

I was shocked after living in Seattle since 1981 how many murals I had missed in my own city!  The tour is so much more than simply driving by murals. David’s enthusiasm for the art, and art history of Seattle is so contagious.  \nA great trip for Seattleites and visitors!!!"

    "description": "One of the best times of year to visit Mount Rainier is in the winter months. When the days get shorter, the summer crowds head home, and the park turns into a true winter wonderland, come visit Longmire in Mount Rainier National Park!\n\nStroll through the old-growth forests, where Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar trees dwarf visitors. The bubbling natural springs tell a story of what lies beneath this abundant and volatile landscape. Experience the natural silence that takes hold as the snow dusted trees insulate the world around you. Learn the diverse history the Longmire area and how this region has attracted visitors long before it was a national park.\n\nAfter arriving at Mt.

Lucky to get a crystal clear day giving us fabulous views of Mount Rainier from various locations throughout to park. Our guide (Brent Maphis) was great fun and shared his excellent knowledge of nature with the group. Everything went smoothly on the day, van was in good condition and plenty of food and snacks provided."

        "reviewBody": "This was my second trip through Evergreen Escapes.    \n\nEasy pickup from downtown hotel, and only 7 people on the trip, so lots of room in the van.   \n\nIt was Mid November and we had a crystal clear and cool day.   The temperature was say 40 degrees when we arrived at an overlook to the park and got a list of the itinerary for the day.    \n\nFirst stop after pictures at the entrance to the park was at Longmire parking lot.   Here we went on a short hike along the Trail of the Shadows.   It is about .7 mile and has some interesting thermal features that reminds you that there is a volcano underneath your feet .    This was a very fit group and even with the guide explanations of everything we completed this in about 15 minutes.\n\nI was pushing for a longer hike ( maybe to carter falls) but I don't think that the guide was allowed to take us any farther into the park.   But she did start us up the Wonderland trail where we put in a 5+ mile out and back hike along a river.  A strenuous couple of minutes before the trail leveled out and the rest of the hike was quite enjoyable.   The guide headed everyone back to the Longmire parking area where she heated up some soup and lunch.   \n\nPost lunch we hiked the Twin Firs loop which is a do not miss hike when on that side of the park.  Lots of huge 500 year old trees were a pleasure to walk through.    \n\nThen a 2 hour drive back to Seattle for a drop off at  our hotel.    \n\nVery nice day hike.   I would recommend the tour to anyone who likes to hike and is in downtown Seattle.   "

There was brain activity in solving the puzzles (they had to use most of the \"hints\" but could solve with some prodding), physically activity in running from one real world hint to the next, and social emtional learning in trying to give everyone turns to solve the puzzles with out spoiling it! I highly recommend for anyone looking for something fun to do with their kids!"

We loved walking around the area and discovering things we would’ve just walked past, the clues were challenging and fun, and we saved them to bring home to show our friends and family! We hope to do one of them again one day! Being in southeastern Idaho, we really hope for ones for Boise and Salt Lake City!!"

As someone who never really stopped to look at everything near the area before, this was a great way to do so. \n\nWe went during a time where one of the puzzles relied on a location closed off due to construction. Thanks to the wonderful hints, we were able to get through it. Overall a wonderful time through Seattle and loved that they incorporated a local business into the puzzle."

We are an active outdoor family but never had tried true mountain biking before and was super excited to learn this activity so we can continue to ride safely.  My boys are 12 & 11 and do a lot of city trail riding and did awesome! We spent the day learning the trails at Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park and can't wait to do it again!  We learned how to maneuver our bikes safely along the trails, learned trail etiquette as well as learned the benefits of having a good quality bike while riding on a mountain trail.\n\nWe were also provided lunch during our day tour which was delicious! I loved that we spent the entire day out doors together as a family and everything was provided for us on this tour, from water, safety gear, bikes, food and snacks as well as transportation straight from our front door!!! Amazing!!!\nMy boys could not stop talking about this experience and can't wait to do this again!! \n\nIf your looking for a fun activity this summer, I would not hesitate to get this on your calendar!!"

It was my first time mountain biking and Ben was very helpful with instruction and tips. We spent the morning in the bike park getting comfortable with riding and having some fun. After a good lunch at a local restaurant, we rode up and down a mountain trail a couple times. It was a great workout, fun when I would finally relax going downhill, and I came away feeling much more confident in my biking skills."

The bikes used were fantastic and Erik provided everything from gear to water to lunch. Pick-up and drop off was right at our hotel, which was very convenient. \n\nMy partner and I both felt challenged and very accomplished by the end of the day. I was very cautious on some of the downhill areas, but never felt pressured to go faster than I was comfortable with. (I even walked some sections to make sure I avoided injuring myself.)  We had the best experience, and now I'm really excited to try mountain biking again! I'd highly recommend this tour and Erik Barton."

They assessed our skills and chose great trails. They combined style lessons and pointers with challenging us to push past our comfort zones and improve. I felt very safe and confident in the hands of Miles and Matt and we all enjoyed the day. Our teenagers have thanked us over and over for arranging the day of mountain biking. I highly recommend Seattle Mountain Biking tours."

        "reviewBody": "Our visit to the Smith Tower Observatory was an absolute treat! From the moment we stepped into the historic elevators, there was a buzz of excitement as we climbed to the top of one of Seattle’s most iconic landmarks. Once at the observatory, we were greeted by breathtaking, unobstructed views of the city skyline from the sparkling waters of Puget Sound to the towering silhouette of Mount Rainier in the distance.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual yet charming, with vintage decor that nods to the tower’s rich history. We made the most of it by grabbing a couple of drinks and some light bites from the bar both were pleasantly good and paired perfectly with the view. The cocktails especially felt like a little luxury as we sipped them with the city sprawling below us.\n\nIt’s not just a pretty view either; the informational displays around the observatory offer fun historical tidbits about Seattle and the tower itself, adding depth to the experience. We ended up lingering longer than planned, soaking in the sunshine and city sounds from above.\n\nOnly small note: it can get a little crowded at peak times, so plan ahead if you want a quieter experience. But overall, a fantastic way to see Seattle from a new perspective!"

I had pre purchased drink as well. \n\nSoon I was navigated  the hall to elevator. Prior to elevator, there was bit of museum/history shown about how Smith Tower operated.\n\nWhen getting on the elevator, the gentleman narrated story about the building. His knowledge is superior!\n\nFinally up at the top of the building, I first decided to get something to drink and sat by the window. You can see the Puget Sound, Bainbridge Island and West Seattle of course the stadiums. Nice view. I decided to step outside to view. The weather at the time was cool. Not that cold. Just Seattle weather. I took couple of photos. I don’t remember if I did see Space needle.\n\nThe whole experience is phenomenal. I love it!\n\nHighly recommend!"

I loved the 360 degree view of the city from the Observation deck. Especially fun after doing the underground tour earlier in the day."

We were told where to find the public restrooms - which was helpful seeing as we were headed out after lunch for two hours. Cat was our tour guide and she was exceptional. She went through the instructions thoroughly but concisely and we were out on the water right away. We happened to be the only two kayaks heading out (other reservations were moved that day to other time slots per the requests of those kayakers).  It was a gorgeous day and Cat gave us tons of interesting facts about the area. She also kept us going at an appropriate pace. We really enjoyed our outing in the Puget Sound. Very highly recommend doing it!!"

Exclusive access – only available on this tour!\nWander the Fremont neighborhood, hub of Seattle’s public art scene and counterculture, with your informative and entertaining guide, who will be sure to introduce you to the famous Troll under the bridge, Vladamir Lenin & more!\nThis tour begins in downtown Seattle and includes a ride on a city transit bus (fare included) with your guide navigating the way. The tour wraps up in Fremont at noon, where you’ll have the opportunity to continue exploring the neighborhood on your own (grab lunch or settle in at a local brewery for a tasting) or ride the bus back into downtown Seattle with your guide – the choice is yours!",

And there weren't a lot of people there, so we got great pics.\nBeing able to go on an actual houseboat was so cool!\nAnd the chocolate was delicious.\nThroughout the entire tour, Daniel was personable, social, and friendly. He's very knowledgeable about Seattle sites and history, which was much appreciated!\nWe stayed in Belltown and would not have made our way to Fremont on our own, so I was very happy to have found this tour online. \nThis tour was worth the money while visiting Seattle!!!"

Unconventional, not a class; learn through experimentation! You get to take risks in this lab with hundreds of ingredients at your fingertips that you wouldn't normally take at home or in a cocktail class. Tools include smoking guns, test tubes, shaker sets, etc.\n\nIt is my goal as your host to work with each of you and fine-tune each event to fit your individual mixology goals. By design, any awkwardness and negative judgment is kicked out the door in order for the madness to ensue! ",

We weren't aware that there was ice until she told us halfway in through the class... for $100 per person, it was a sorry experience."

Everyone was themselves, and you are allowed to have fun making Mocktails and learning from everyone in the room and it is perfectly okay to make a mistake!  Matter of fact, you are encouraged to go outside your comfort zone and show that element of creativity. Jen and her team were great at hosting us and the ambience was very warm and welcoming.  The space and venue/loft had a close and intimate feeling as well as being right in the heart of Seattle.  Def. a must do if you are looking to meet new people or just trying something with your partner/friends or just doing something fun in Seattle!"

        "reviewBody": "My friend found out about this experience and asked me to go because I love mocktails. I thought this would be a mocktail class but it was actually a free for all drink making experimentation lab, no lessons on technique, but still a great experience. I had a lot of fun.\n\nWe first donned lab coats and chose our mad scientist names. Jen, the owner, gave us a 10 minute introduction of all the stations and we were let loose in the lab to concoct our own drink creations.\n\nThe experience was rather immersive in an atelier-like workspace that is decorated with old books and antique trinkets. It felt like I was in an eclectic mad scientist’s lab/apothecary type of environment. There were vials, funnels, shakers, stirrers, measuring spoons, tweezers—all manner of lab tools to aid in experimentation.\n\nThe best part about this lab is the variety of ingredients I got to discover and sample. There were ingredients I didn’t even know about or wouldn’t even think to buy myself. I enjoyed trying the freeze dried juice powders, various bitters, the non-alcoholic liquors, and edible glitter.\n\nThere were nice touches like a smoker to smoke your drink with wood chips, herb plants to pick fresh herbs, fun dehydrated fruit pieces for garnish, and fresh citrus. There was also an infusion station with various spices, dried herbs, and teas. Jen made sure to supply everything you would need to create the ultimate drink! I felt like a kid in a candy store.\n\nThere were also bulk bin snacks provided like wasabi peas, walnuts, gummies, chocolates covered almonds, and banana chips along with charcuterie from the deli in the Melrose Market.\n\nLastly there were 8 participants in this lab and I felt that was just the right amount of people. I didn’t feel crowded or like I was competing for tools/space. We had free roam in the lab and Jen was very generous with sharing some of the more exotic and expensive ingredients. I like how I didn’t feel restricted or limited in resources or time. The 2 hour time allotted felt enough.\n\nI definitely recommend this experience and I would for sure go back!\n\n"

I created several mocktails, and really enjoyed experimenting with flavors.  \n\nI will definitely be back"

The loft is decorated nicely with a mix of science, fun, and old fashioned library style.  There are also tons of ingredients, arranged at multiple stations across the lab/loft.  \n\nJen, the host, was fun, informative, and easy going.  She gave a tour, and has clearly put a lot of thought into this experience.  \n\nAs I mentioned above, there are TONS of ingredients available, so this is a good space to try new things that you may not have tried before.  \n\nYou can choose your own adventure here, and I chose to follow one recipe at first, then create my own concoctions afterwards.  \n\nHighly recommend!"

I chose to infuse dried ginger and papaya with pecan wood and dried pineapple with cherry wood.  There's also a whole section of dried powders.  I used kava, li hing mui, coconut cream, pomegranate, guava, lychee and honey powder.  Above the dried powders, there's various teas to infuse in distilled water.  I chose passion fruit flower.  In addition, mocktail booze in rum and tequila form are available as well as a range of bitters.  Jen also provides juices from Pressed juicery, pomegranate juice, calpico, lemonade and fresh lime, lemon, ginger and maraschino and luxardo cherries.  We also had various glitters, salt and sugars to play with.\n\nThe combinations are endless!\n\nOn the snack table, there were corn nuts, red vines, various nuts with a nut cracker, chocolate covered almonds, proscuitto, coppa and Dubliner cheese.  I would recommend eating afterwards since these are small bites.  \n\nThere's also a vending machine with fortune cookies with NSFW messages inside.\n\nOverall a great experience and would love to experience it again"
