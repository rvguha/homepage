Dropped off at places, no explanation, no info nothing. For the price they charge its daylight robbery,better off just getting your own taxi and going. They advertised Wifi & water neither of which were available. We put in a complaint to the company using WhatsApp,only to then be blocked by them!! All in all a waste of money & waste of a day.

Our tour guide, Marcia, was very friendly and knowledgeable and made sure that the vegetarians in our party had something to eat. We did the tour with a 3 year old and a 20 month old, which I wouldn’t really recommend as they got bored. \n We did have some trouble getting on the tour as it was cancelled twice and no one called us and the instructions for the meeting place said to meet at two different places! But we got it all figured out. I recommended that you call ahead to make sure the tour hasn’t been cancelled and to verify the meeting place. "

The food was plentiful and many options for all food needs. Guide made sure to meet the needs of food allergies on my part and went the extra mile to get a vegetable spring roll since I was allergic to pork made sure to inquire about dill since I am also allergic to that. I would totally recommend this tour to locals and out of towners but would extra recommend if you have out of town  guest for you both to learn a little and have some fun."

I'm quite sure I forgot a few places and for that I apologize but it was all very interesting and delicious....every last bite and I was very full.

I have gone on 4 different tours of the market, and each one has unique fun things but it is hard to find new and different items in the market that I'm not aware of. Melissa had at least 5 key points that she pointed out about the history of the market and some of the back stories of the market. She was dedicated to presenting us with a fantastic tour and to providing a top notch tour experience. The food was tasty, there were just two of us on the tour, but that made it even more of an intimate experience. If you want to take a tour with a guide who hasn't just memorized a scrip, but has done her own research as well and has incorporated what she has learned into the tour then Seattle Food Tours with Melissa as your guide won't be a disappointment."

What a gem it is!  My adult children were with me (who have done food tours in different cities) and they loved it too.  We were able to stop by and talk with the local vendors and try things that I would have never picked out for myself. We fell in love with the truffle oil...and now we have incorporated it into our cooking here at home.  Melissa clearly loves the market and it's people and they know her.

I did the driving experience with Motorsport Lab in Oklahoma City 2 years ago and had the best time ever. The instructors were awesome. The track was way better. The employees made you feel welcome and excited. This other company that I went through today was unprepared, had a tiny track, the instructors weren't very much fun, and they acted like they were doing you a favor by being there. I'll never do this again unless it is Motorsport Lab. This is a real review. Kudos to Motorsport Lab for being the best in the Business that I've experienced !!"

There were a few hiccups, such as one of the cars needing to have a tire changed and the weather was rainy, but nothing dampened the spirits of all of the people who patiently waited for their turn.  I highly recommend spending the extra money to purchase a video.,.it is a split screen, so you can see the experience from the driver's perspective and from outside of the car.  Of course, there would be extensive paperwork to be completed for insurance purposes...the liability must be insane, given the nature of their business, but this was a painless procedure..I have seen many reviews about the suggestion of an exorbitant tip...a tip is a gratuity, not an obligation.  The instructors certainly earn their tips..they really help to create a fabulous experience, but we did not feel we needed to pay 30% of the total cost.  The instructor seemed satisfied with what we gave him, so I would not let this dissuade you from experiencing the ride of a lifetime."

After finding out about the 25% tip on what the original cost would have been, which means upwards of tipping $159 for what we found out was about 45 seconds to 1 minute of driving time. They also want you to purchase several different insurances, mounting to $300. This so called deal quickly turned into a scam. We also found out that you can’t shift out of second gear and you drive around some cones in a parking lot, not around a racetrack.  We tried the cancel and get a refund, but we didn’t get a callback. This company is horrible and misleading! Don’t waste your money. If you want a real exotic car experience, just rent one for a day. You’ll get way more driving time and actually get to shift out of second gear. Don’t waste your money with this company. Learn from our mistake."

When I purchased the Groupon voucher, it was my impression that they each would get to drive all three cars. When I confirmed with the Motorsports Lab, it was clear that they would only get to drive one of the vehicles, which was disappointing. Further, the waiver is extensive, aggressive and misleading. I have read a number of reviewers who stopped at the waiver and went no further. As such, I set my expectations low for the actual experience. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the experience itself was very cool, both guys loved it and our families got to explore two supercars with which you usually can't get as up close and personal. The drivers were very supportive and excited and a true value add to whole day."

I was scheduled to drive the Lambo, but ended up driving the Ferrari as it seemed that more people were waiting on the Lambo and I told the Sherpa I wasn't picky.  He later thanked me for helping with the line \"flow\".  I've read many negative reviews, but for me this was a great time and i would really like to do it again.  I was not surprised by the short course; after all, I only paid $99 so expecting a full sized track is not realistic.  I also watched the videos and read the information on their website that clearly explained their course setups.\n\nI never expected to be able to drive a Ferrari, so this was AWESOME!  The Sherpa was fantastic and he made the drive much more enjoyable with his directions and comments.  I will always remember the final corner on my last lap.  I started to ease up on the throttle and he said \"you don't need to let up, just steer\" and he was right!  I would have loved longer or more laps, but it was a blast.....especially for the price!  I tipped the guy for his effort, enthusiasm, and assistance with taking pictures.  He earned a tip!\n\nI see they are coming back to my area in a month or so, and I intend to book this again and drive the Lambo!  Then I will have driven both a Lambo and a Ferrari.....bucket list!\n\nI also wanted to comment on the negative review where the guy said he and a couple of buddies could buy 2 cars and do the same thing.  Yes, I'm sure you could, but have you really thought about what it would take to do that?  Setting up a website, buying 2 super cars, buying the trailer and truck to haul these cars and gear, maintenance on cars, paying for the insurance for this type of business, coordinating all of the different locations around the country and paying the rental fees, lodging, meals, and expenses for the travelling crew, payroll for the crew, etc.  If you think you can do all of this for about $200k, I think you would be wrong.\n\nWhile I feel bad for the folks who had dates cancelled on them, but in my own experience, this was a great deal and one I will remember for the rest of my life.  I got to actually drive a Ferrari!!!!!  HUGE GRIN!"

The advertisement talked about an autocross track, but when I went, it was just a very short oval. I expected somewhat of a road course, a few turns, some left, some right, definitely didn’t get that. Don’t get me wrong, the car was fast and it was a cool experience, but driving while constantly turning left, since the “straights” were too short to actually go straight. I basically drove in a giant circle and had to stay in 2nd gear. I would not do this for the regular multi hundred dollars they usually charge. If you don’t get a deal on like groupon like I did, or someway else, it’s not worth the money."

Traction control let’s you not worry about spinning out or otherwise losing control.  Some drivers were creeping around and nothing wrong with that, but if you do it, don’t be intimidated.  And you don’t have to worry about upshifting, downshifting, etc.  you start out in first gear, very quickly shift into 2nd and then you’re done.  Stand on the gas and stand on the brake!  Loved it!"

        "reviewBody": "This was an early birthday gift from my adorable wife! She's very generous, and very knowledgeable about what I like! First, just a bit of information to clear up, as I've seen this in the negative reviews. It's a Autocross setup, not a race track. The size of the setup will vary from town to town; some larger, some smaller. You get to drive around corners sharply, and get a really good hint of the speed capabilities, but it's not a top speed event. Yes, there is a sheet with additional disclaimers/waivers on it, but with my experience, it was only suggested, and not forced on you. You don't have to pay for them if you don't want to, and you should be careful enough that it won't be a problem. I had no problems contacting them if needed, and the day of the event, I found the folks involved friendly, laid back, and helpful. My \"sherpa\", the guy in the car with me, was very nice, and in fact, I think we chatted about cars and such a little longer than was necessary (my wife was wondering when we were going to actually start!). The experience itself was a blast! I have a little Miata with a few modifications on it and can zip around corners and take off pretty quickly, so I had a little experience with that. But nothing prepares you for the beautiful sound and indescribable power of the Ferrari 458! It's a beautifully designed, incredibly engineered work of art...basically sex on four wheels! I had a fantastic time, and again, I thank my wonderful wife, and the great staff of Motorsport Lab for the experience."

Little did I know how much fun and excitement those  3 laps, plus a couple more would be. I had no expectation of driving on a race track or that this would be a driving class. It was several laps around a coned marked track with an observer to coach me along. For a few short minutes I was so totally focused on pushing myself to the limit with the car that I only remembered to breath when I turned back into the \"pit\" area. It took several minutes to remove the silly grin from my face. For a guy that has done more than his share of exciting stuff in 60 years, that is saying allot. If you get the chance to do this jump on it. And remember, drive it like you stole it."

The first stop will be the Pioneer Square neighborhood located in the historic district of the old metropolis where we will visit the origins of Seattle on a walk suitable for the whole family and full of history, architecture, and photography.\n\nWe will continue to the Ballard Locks for our second stop. We will see the boats enter and leave the Pacific Ocean to the lakes surrounding the city.\n\nFinally, we will end with one of the most impressive panoramic views before ending the tour where we can take some of the best photos of the city center. The tour ends at the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, or returned to your hotel. It is generally a 3-hour tour but it can be extended if the group wishes. This tour is highly recommended for children and adults of all ages.\n\nIMPORTANT: The tour is in English but it can be arranged in Spanish.",

He was informative, interesting and you could tell he was passionate about his job and his city.   Highly recommend you take this tour - convenient pick up at our hotel, several great stops and drop off at the market so we could continue to explore this great city!"

Mario took us to very interesting places and had so much information, history and facts about Seattle.  He met us in time and discussed what was of interest to us then took us to places and told us stories about the area. Took pics for us, then gave us suggestions on where we could go on our own.  Saved us money by helping us with subway instead of Uber.  He dropped our bags off first from airport so we could tour around without our baggage.  Yes I would highly recommend booking Mario when you are in Seattle area.  He speaks 4 languages and is honest."

We were picked up in the Zipline shuttle, and immediately upon boarding the shuttle, we were offered coffee and homemade blueberry/lavender muffins. Off to a great start!\nOnce at the farm, we filled out our forms and then went to the barn to be weighed and fitted into our harnesses and helmets.  Our tour guides Colin and Jenna were outstanding!  They put everyone at ease and made the entire experience very easy and memorable.  Colin has the best attitude and sense of humor - he was fabulous!  There were 4 children in our group of zipliners, and both guides were awesome with everyone - kids and adults alike.  We were amazed at their ability to easily remember the names of all 9 people who were \"zipping!\"\nRiding the ziplines was so thrilling!!   A little bit scary at first, but not too bad ... such a fun, free feeling as you're zipping through the beautiful, green scenery with the cool breeze on your face.  Coming from Las Vegas, we really appreciated teh cooler weather and beautiful, green scenery.\nThere was one point where we stopped to have some cold lavender lemonade in between zip lines, and took some fun selfies with the Canopy Tours selfie camera.\nWe also ordered the lunch to eat at the farm after we were done zipping.  It was a nice sized salad, a huge 1/2 sandwich and a very delicious cookie.\nAfterwards we purchased a couple of items from the gift shop.  The lady was super friendly, helping us try on sweatshirts and choosing the perfect size.\nI would absolutely recommend Canopy Tours - it was a tremendous experience from beginning to end!"

(Although I must say I have bragging rights on this one!) Everyone at Canopy Tours seemed to know just how much coddling this (ahem, old) newbie needed - didn't have traffic worries because I relaxed on the shuttle. The zip guides and other guests were all super friendly and encouraging, (thank you for the tip on how to cross the bridge!) and who can beat this location? Bonus: perfect weather day, and a peek at the challenge course tucked discreetly into nature. I can't wait to bring folks here for Team Building or Zipping!"

Participants varied in age, and everyone had a wonderful time!  It was definitely a highlight of the corporate retreat and was a great way for employees to get to know each other and support one another.  Planning our outing was a breeze, Mona Campbell did a wonderful job helping me coordinate the event and was very available and accommodating to our group's needs.  We set-up group transportation to/from the farm from our hotel in Seattle, this was a breeze and both drivers (Dave Baggenstos and Jacob Newman) were on time to take us there and back, no issues whatsoever.\n\nThe actual ziplining experience was awesome, the length of time of the tour and the amount of lines to zip was perfect, no one lost interest!  It was a perfect day (which helped), and all of the instructors were friendly.  They made sure we felt safe and comfortable throughout the whole tour.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to book a fun event for family, friends, or in my case, coworkers.  It's great for team-building and a unique opportunity for everyone to experience and share afterwards!"
