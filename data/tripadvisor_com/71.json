He took care of us by getting us to the tulip farm right when they were opening and even adding in rest area stops during our drive to and from.  It was so nice not to have to drive, worry about parking, etc.  We just got to enjoy both the tulip fields and La Conner.  We would recommend this trip to our friends and family absolutely!"

I even got to see a bald eagle for the first time. And when the weather turned sour he allowed us to stay in the bus and out of the rain. I came to Seattle for my birthday and this tour really astounded me. I highly recommend this tour and will be sure to do it again next year!!"

We were struck by the fantastic beauty of this part of the U.S. and how friendly the people were as we made our way across Washington and back through Oregon. The itinerary that Guy and Robin put together was excellent -- we really feel we saw the \"best of the best\" in this region -- and our time together included enough flexibility that we could request customizations that Guy willingly included. Guy knew all of the best wineries, and we learned so much about the landscape and history of these areas. He also had suggestions on what to see and where to eat when we were on our own. We were able to also enjoy time with Robin (and their children!), so that by the end of the week, we felt like we had been traveling with friends we had known for a long time. Guy and Robin have created a tour experience with just the right mix of structure and flexibility. We HIGHLY recommend this company!"

Take a day trip to explore the beautiful town of Victoria on the Victoria Clipper, leaving from downtown Seattle. The high-speed Victoria Clipper will take you on a relaxing 3-hour cruise through the Puget Sound to Victoria’s Inner Harbor. This passenger-only ferry features a host of great amenities, like roomy, comfortable seats, an on-board duty-free gift shop and locally sourced food and beverage available for purchase. A U.S. passport, passport card, enhanced driver’s license or an enhanced ID card (EDL/ID) is required to cross the U.S./Canadian border.",

The trip back was a nightmare.  The air conditioning was broken.  It was well into the nineties and even hotter on the boat. They put some water out but ran out of ice and did not refill the water. The worst part was the body odor. It made me nauseous.  People were sweating through their clothes. The  outside deck was so crowded it was impossible to go out. They opened the upper doors for a while, this cooled the upper deck some what. The downstairs front cabin never cooled off. They didn't open the door to let any air in. When we got back to Seattle it was 84 and that was way cooler than the boat. These people could care less . Do better fsc clipper"

She made me feel a lot more confident that everything would roll smoothly.  I'm glad I met her the day we departed for Victoria to thank her personally, such a sweet lady.  It's always nice to put a face to the voice over the phone.  Our vacation package included 3 nights in Seattle and 2 nights in Victoria with a side trip to Butchart Gardens.   Everything went smoothly on our trip to Victoria.  We parked at their recommended parking garage which was only $10/day. Easy walking distance to the Clipper Terminal.  The Victoria Clipper was a beautiful boat with comfortable seating and onboard food service.  We did not have any issues with seating going, coming back was a little fuller, but Desiree upgraded us to priority Group 1 boarding.  You will board by groups.  Clipper Vacations arranged for us to stay at the Chateau Victoria, which is a very nice hotel within walking distance to the Clipper Terminal if you have just carry-on baggage.  Again, very pleased on how well the whole trip went."

Anyway, we took the Victoria Clipper from Pier 69 in Seattle and found it to be an easy and relaxing ride across the water. We even used the Clipper's hotel specials to stay at the Rialto Hotel, which was wonderful. On the Clipper, the attendants are all very cheery and pleasant and everything is explained over the loud speaker so there should be little confusion of the processes. During the summer months, the lines and waiting to get on and off the ferry is a somewhat vexing but nothing that is unmanageable. The Clipper folks ought to figure out how to expand the seating in the waiting rooms, that would help."

        "reviewBody": "Here are two tips:  1) if you can, travel with carry-on.  First, you'll save $10 (they charge for each checked bag) but you'll also save 50-60 minutes getting off the clipper on each end.   Carry-on passengers get off first, then passengers with checked luggage get off but only AFTER all the luggage, one s-l-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n crain lift at a time, is off the clipper.   And, you get the pleasure of watching this process while standing dockside.   I'm always wary of companies with less than efficient processes claim that \"Government regulations require that...\" \n\n2) Bring food.  We have to eat Gluten Free, and they have limited options on the ship.   When you are departing at 7:30 in the morning, the family can get hangry.   \n\nWhy only 4 stars?...the service is overpriced:  US$830 (plus $40 in checked baggage fees RT, so $870) for a family of 5 RT.  Victoria is worth it, but next time I will drive from Seattle.  The car ferry from Port Angeles, WA to Victoria would have been $305 RT for all of us and our car.  And with the checked-baggage \"Gov't regulated\" waiting...we would have arrived to our hotel sooner vs the Clipper.  You are now trip-advised."

        "reviewBody": "The overall experience for our 2 day 1 night stay was about what I expected.  Some things that happen can be unavoidable and always expect the unexpected.  Here is a couple things to note for others looking into this (& Victoria Clipper as a suggested opportunity to improve).\nThe city tour (bus) we were ‘told’ to board was not a double-Decker as they/you advertised on your website.  When I asked to board another double-Decker bus parked there I was told no.  Also, the driver’s attempt to be a comedienne could have been interpreted as offensive to some.  Turn up the fans on the hot days, the buses are warm!\nOur Butterfly Garden tour was limited to 40 minutes, which made us feel rushed because we were threatened to be left there if we did not get back on the same bus with the same driver in the allotted time.  If it is crowded it will take at least this much time to enjoy all of it.  We would have liked a bit more time to enjoy it longer.  No food options here, snacks & soda vending machines.\nOur Butchart Garden tickets were not given to us until we left the Butterfly Garden, sort of held for ransom to insure we got on the bus?  It would be nice to have some sort of alternative “proof I paid”, in the event something goes awry given the 3rd party contracted service this is.  Review the food options here first before going – pack & plan if you need to.\nThe waiting area to be boarded past customs (in Victoria) needs to be made more comfortable – maybe consider air conditioning?  When the room is packed full of people and it is a warm day outside, those tin chairs and 3 fans running just don’t cut it.  We waited nearly an hour in this pleasantry.  \nAlso when there is an arrival/departure delay your employees should inform passengers of this BEFORE they pass through the customs area.  Certainly waiting outside on the grass, maybe under some shade would be more comfortable, especially for the elderly and those with young children.   \n\nBottom line is delays can be understood, if care for your comfort is taken into consideration."
