I’ve used this shoe’s predecessor on 100s of aggressive backcountry callouts (scree slopes, rock climbing, extreme winter conditions &amp; more) and these shoes provided optimal comfort and support.  I have tried a few other hiking shoes but always went back to these.  After 16 years the sole on one of the shoes suffered some collapse and while I still use them I have decided to buy one more pair and when I say one more pair I mean they will last until I cannot hike anymore.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this one for hiking, but I realized right away that it was the perfect garment for winter cycling! I get too hot in shells, so the slight air through of this hoody keeps me at the perfect temperature in the 35s to 55s. I took it hiking and was also amazed! Combined with a rain jacket is perfect when you are in the shade, but take the shell off while you&apos;re activelly moving and you are perfect. The red color litterally pops in every picture. Its perfect! I specially like the fit of the hood. Highly recommend this product",

I like the thumb holes and chest pocket. I&apos;m 6&apos;3&quot; 210 lbs and have a 44/45 in chest. I was worried the large size would be too tight so I ordered an XL. It bunches up a bit in the abdomen but otherwise fits well.",

        "reviewBody": "I think it&apos;s unfair to give these boots a low rating just because they run small. I&apos;m an 8.5/9 in street shoes and at least a 9/9.5 in most hiking boots and shoes, but in these I had to take a 10. Totally worth it! They&apos;re the perfect marriage of a lightweight and flexible, yet decently supportive upper and a burly, sticky, rugged sole. Would I wear these to carry a super heavy load over multiple days? No. But for just about everything else, they&apos;re perfect. The heel lock cable system is incredible. Once I got the laces dialed in, my heel has never slipped. They&apos;re very comfortable once broken in (do it slowly, which I learned the hard way!) and they served me well on a rainy, challenging 7-day Kilimanjaro expedition. I didn&apos;t slip once on wet rock, dirt, mud, or packed snow, and I felt confident in my footing when we had to traverse some inherently slippery loose scree and slush on the steep descent. Highly recommend!!",

If you are doing multiple days maybe get the 60 or 65L.

I haven&apos;t used the case yet for travelling but I can tell it is bullet proof enough to withstand the baggage handlers throwing it around and getting slammed around the plane&apos;s cargo area. If you want the peace of mind that your precious bike will be in one piece when you get to your destination, go for a hard case, and the Thule Transition is one of the best cases out there. I like how it has the stands to transform it into a bike repair stand, may need to put foam padding on where the straps would go onto the bike to avoid rubbing.",

        "reviewBody": "After using the Transition case to fly from MA to Colorado and back, all of my initial doubts about the case were eliminated.  A truly easy case to travel with!\n\nYes, it is a bit larger and heavier than traditional clamshell cases, but not significantly.  About 20 inches DIM larger (L W H) and about 5lbs heavier.  My  brother traveled the same trip with a clamshell case   great case, but the Transition&apos;s vertical orientation and rail mount system proved to be much more travel friendly.\n\nLittle disassembly of my bike was required to fit in the Transition case. The front wheel was removed and the forks locked into the fork mount rail.   I pulled the rear wheel and swapped in a spare rear hub/cassette/skewer and left my rear derailleur mounted.  This protected my rear triangle and tensioned the chain to keep it from damaging the frame.  I also removed the saddle/post and handlebar/stem.  Bar/stem was zip tied to top tube and forks.  Entire frame was covered with pipe foam, but since the case does not contact the frame, this was for extra precaution only.   Wheelset was placed in the provided wheel bags and the top cover was locked in place using the two ratchet buckles.  I secured a TSA combination lock through the D rings.\n\nTSA opened and inspected the Transition case in both directions, but there was no evidence of inspection, other than the TSA information tag inside.  Usually cases (ski, bicycle, etc.) are not repacked or sealed the same after TSA inspection.  I assume because of the simplicity of closure, the Transition case was completely resealed exactly as I had packed it.  Conversely, my brother&apos;s clamshell case had 4 straps left unsecured by TSA.  \n\nThe baggage handlers in Denver commented how easy the case was for them to handle when they returned it to me.  The Transition case has a few very minor scuffs after travel, but unless inspected closely it still looks new.  All hardware and handles remained securely attached and survived the trip with no damage.\n\nThe vertical orientation of the Transition case makes it very stable  and easy to maneuver. Most cases roll in a horizontal position, which can make navigating narrow spaces and crowded airport terminals challenging.  The Transition case is about 6 inches taller than clamshell cases, but it rolled (upright) into the rear of a minivan with plenty of clearance.  I did have to lay the case on its side to transport in a midsize SUV.\n\nUpon arrival at my destination, I slid the stem/bar back on the steerer, realigned, and set proper torque.  Did the same with post/saddle  I removed the hub/cassette assembly and fitted my rear wheel.  Finally, I removed the bike from the rail mount and installed my front wheel.  Ready to ride!\n\nFor the parts of my trip where transportation of bike by vehicle was required, I used the open (top removed) Transition case as a rail mount carrier in the back of a mini van.  A very stable and protected way to transport that only required removal of the front and rear wheels.\n\nSeeing how well the Transition case traveled to my destination, I no longer had ANY doubts about traveling with the Transition.  \n\nOnly suggestion might be a backup strap (rubber or velcro) to lock the rear of the rail into the bottom of the case   just as a precaution in case the primary lock mechanism is dislodged by large impact.\n\nPerfect case Thule!!  Thanx.",

I was embarrassed to send in my old pack for repair and, surprisingly, Osprey sent me a replacement. So grateful for their policy and standing behind my original purchase so long ago. Really enjoying some of the improvements of the feature set of the new Atmos. One negative point - I am struggling to zip the pouches on the hip belt while wearing the pack. Should work easily one-handed but it does not work well. Encountered another backpacker with the same model that said he was having the same problem. His pack and mine were both brand new. Hoping it improves with use and break-in. Really pumped on the pack overall. Super comfortable even when overloaded (wanted to be &lt; 30 lbs but carried 38 lbs when full on Day 1).",

        "reviewBody": "This is one of the most critical pieces of gear from my 2023 Appalachian Trail thru-hike. Before I had picked any of my other gear, I knew my pack would be an Osprey. It didn&apos;t take much research to settle on the Atmos 50. This thing is a beast and could handle anything I threw at it or in it during my hike. \n\nThe best feature is the one everybody already knows well: the airspace and ergonomic curvature that perfectly forms to your back. Furthermore, this distributes weight very efficiently, allowing your hips to bear more of the burden and relieve your shoulders. Other features I love include the waist pouches where I stored quick access items like my multi-tool and hand sanitizer, the included rain fly for quick rain protection, and the angular water bottle holders on each side where I had quick and convenient access to my one liter Smartwater bottles. I even made regular use of the two pockets in the brain portion. \n\nThe interior dimensions are sufficient to fit a bear vault of the largest size turned sideways. There are straps on the bottom end of the pack that frequently held my tent, though you could also extend the top straps for the brain and store your tent under there too. The shoulder straps are thick and comfortable. I was able to attach a phone pouch on one and regularly attached my umbrella to the other.\n\nThe materials are rugged. Despite all the use and abuse, scraping on trees and rocks, repetitive motion abrasion, weather exposure, and slinging around, the pack held up well without failure for 2,000 miles. \n\nThere are probably adjustments I could have made to reduce weight, as this comes in at 4.2 lb. This while most thru-hiking packs in the ultralight category are less than half of that. With Osprey you&apos;re getting two extra pounds of comfort, in a sense. Alternatively, they do have the Exos 58 that weighs less. Also, regarding sizing, I think osprey could improve by separating them out into four: S, M, L, and XL. Other lesser known UL brands do this, so I would think osprey could handle it. This is my only real &quot;complaint&quot;. All around, Osprey is, in my book, the best backpack maker in existence.",

I can pull it forward when gardening to better shield my face but also can push it back and see well to drive tractor or 4-wheel. Chin strap keeps it secure when really flying around the property and it doesn’t look dorky but actually is really attractive. I can shape and reshape the brim which Is amazing. Looks great with overalls and mud boots, goes to the hardware store the barn, chicken coop and the fair. Honestly I want one at every door and one for the car! Thankfully this company has tons of styles to choose from so I will be getting more and soon!",

        "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not a women&apos;s saddle, it&apos;s not a mtb saddle, it&apos;s a saddle that is flat across the back.\nI went through about 4 of the Devo version before they where discontinued and spent several years trying SMP, Fabric, FiziK, and a WTB Volt before trying the Deva because it is marketed to women. Most of them now collect dust in a cabinet. I&apos;ve now spent over 2 years with the Deva and the only difference is the cover is now a more durable microfiber and the price is lower. It is shorter than my other saddles, but after a few rides you don&apos;t notice that.\nRead Steve Hogg all about SMP where he introduces the concept of effective width (google is your friend). I put a ruler across the saddle and measured width where it rolled off .25 inches. Compared to a SMP dynamic the total width is about 3mm more, but the effective width increases by over an inch across the the back. The difference disappears through the transition to the nose. And it&apos;s not just the width of your sit bones. I have an expensive carbon railed saddle that looks out of place on my 1988 Stumpjumper that works fine with the higher and shorter reach I use to ride with grandkids, but not when I rotate my hips forward on a race bike.\nHighly recommended.",

        "reviewBody": "I recently did a four day trip carrying ~42lbs of gear with this pack. That included ~12lbs of camera equipment and a large 11L bear can. This pack held and carried all that really well. Once the harness and hip belt are dialed in right this pack is quite comfy even with a lot of weight in it. All the zippered pocket (side, hip, internal, bottom) makes organization really easy. I could stuff all my warm wearables in one side zipper pocket and all my rain gear in the other. The front zipper access meant I could get to camera gear stored in a camera gear cube without unpacking everything. This pack is also really robust and puts up with the punishment of the backcountry better several other packs I&apos;ve used. I&apos;ve been searching for a good &quot;photography backpacking&quot; bag for a long time and this pack really hits a lot of critical features (despite the obvious weight penalty).",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had many different bibshorts over the years, including from brands like Pearl Izumi, Castelli, Giordana, Assos, Descente (remember them?), Mavic, etc.  I&apos;ve been an Assos adherent since the orange EI inserts.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think Assos has met those lofty heights since them.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, they&apos;re still good -- and I currently have a pair of the Equipe RS S9 as well as the Cento Evo -- but I feel that the days of Assos being head and shoulders over the rest may be gone.\n\nConversely, I was always just a bit disappointed with Castelli.  The original bodypaint bibs were ok, but fell apart relatively quickly.  A prior version of the Free Aero was comically small and tight in the legs.  And the sizing was all over the place, apparently depending on whatever factory Castelli had decided it would subcontract its wares to for that particular item.  I currently have a pair of Free Aero 4, and while some things are very good (overall fit, compression, leg grippers, quality of the short materials) others leave me underwhelmed (bib straps, apparent durability of chamois).  \n\nThese Premio bibs, however, tick all the boxes so far.  The fit is fantastic -- snug, compressive, comfortable.  The woven material feels great against the skin and appears to draw moisture (ahem, sweat) from the skin to the surface of the bibs.  The straps are comfortable and lay flat (and seem to be the right size for the bibs!).  The leg grippers are fantastic -- pretty much invisible from the outside, grippier than most grippers on any bibs I&apos;ve tried, barring the current Free Aero 4 -- and don&apos;t pinch your legs at all.  The laser-etched graphics look great, subtle and should be durable.\n\nThe chamois is a version of the same Progetto X2 Air as in the Free Aero 4.  But(!) Castelli seems to have addressed one of my concerns with the version in the Free Aero 4, by stitching it to the shorts all the way around in the Premio.  (The Free Aero 4 was open at the &quot;V&quot; notch cutout in the back of the chamois -- in my experience, the exposed foam and padding would delaminate, starting from that opening.  Hopefully, stitching the pad all the way around will increase durability.)  I do note that the chamois in these Premio bibs seems a bit firmer and stiffer than in the Free Aero, so maybe there are other changes as well.  I find the chamois quite good, but a bit stiff feeling, and it could really use a bit more front coverage, like the Assos chamois.  \n\nOverall, these have become the first bibs I grab for longer, or special rides.\n\nUPDATE -- So, I wore these shorts for a century about a month ago (remember, these are my go-to for longer, or special rides).  About 25 miles in, I crashed, going about 18-19mph, according to my Strava data.  I hit the asphalt on my left side, with pretty big bruising and road rash on my knee, shoulder, and hip.  My Q36.5 jersey got a big hole in the shoulder; my Assos glove got a big hole in the palm; even my Sidi shoes got scratched up some on the left Tecno buckle and upper/sole interface.  Amazingly, despite big bruising and road rash on my hip, these shorts remained completely intact.  The only sign of the crash is the fabric has just the faintest abrasion lightening on my left hip.  While I hope not to have to test it again (knock on wood), it seems the woven lycra fabric Castelli uses is quite durable.",

        "reviewBody": "So this is a really good bibshort.  Probably the best I have.  Compression is on point, cut is good, and the chamois is also very comfortable.  The look is understated and will go with every jersey.  The straps initially seem a bit short (and tight), but I didn&apos;t really notice them once I was on the bike.  Heat management seems moderate.  They weren&apos;t especially cool or breathable.  Not bad, just not &quot;next level&quot; good.\n\nOverall, they&apos;re great, but there&apos;s nothing so amazing about them that they&apos;re worth $100 more than my next nicest pair of bibs.  Or at least not yet.  Two hours is my longest ride in them so far, so maybe they&apos;ll shine with more time in the saddle.\n\nI was a little concerned with Castelli sizing, but medium is a great fit for me (I usually wear medium in most brands).\n\nUpdate - 5 hours on gravel and they were great.",

          "Super light fabric and high quality feel, but they run extremely small&amp;comically small really. I&apos;m 6&apos;0 155lbs and with pedal mafia, rapha, maap etc., a small is typically perfect. The small was nice and snug on the legs and hips, but the straps were literally half the length of my torso. Even though the elastic is very supple and could stretch over my shoulders, they were way too tight to wear for more than a minute or two; even tucked into an aero ride position. I would recommend sizing up one or two sizes."

I truly do not believe those models are in a size small. The companies website actually gave me a size large based off their fit calculator but I settled on the medium. I haven?t decided if I?ll keep it yet or not so the tags are still attached as I?ve only tried it on but it is very well made and feels very supportive (for my size anyways). I used to have implants and I cannot imagine anything higher than a B fitting comfortably into this top!",

I own a pull over Nano puff, and this is what I&apos;m comparing it to. This is an ok substitute. The material is a little more of a trash bag consistency compared to a nano puff and doesn&apos;t feel like it regulates temperature quit as well. The fit is a little tight for me in the upper arms with anything other than a thin base layer. Arm length and waist are good. If you are thin and usual fit a medium this should work fine. If you are on the larger size of medium, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.",

The fit is true to size, I got my usual size 7. The toe box feels comfortably and roomy without being clunky. My toe nails stick up and I often feel pain and pressure from tops of most shoes, however the leather on these is supple and I can tell I won&apos;t have that issue with them. The simple lacing means they&apos;re quick and easy to put on and tie up, while adding a firm fit around the middle of the foot. I look forward to breaking these and wearing them all around!",

The inner short did ride up a little but not to the point of being annoying.  I didn’t like the way my phone felt in the side pocket, it didn’t feel very secure and pulled the shorts down a bit.  Note I do have a smaller iPhone.  This is not a huge drawback for me since I can also put my phone in my running vest/pack.  I think it would be fine for hiking or walking.  Overall I am satisfied with the fit and comfort.  I will probably also purchase a black pair.",

The color is much more interesting in person, and seems a bit darker in natural lighting than what you see in these well-lit studio photos here.  This will be the closest thing to black I ever buy.  I own many styles of hats, but the Open Road has to be my favorite overall.  So far I&apos;ve got the cognac in felt, and in straw, and this sage.",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased the Sage color,  Size 7.  All I can say is that it&apos;s a really nice hat.  Soft, flexible (not floppy) and extremely comfortable.  The Open Road 6X is the stiffer model of this hat.  I like that one also.  This fairly new Open Road Royal Deluxe hat is more of a dressy, soft fabric hat.  Although one can wear it anywhere, anytime.  My experience with Stetson sizing is that their felt hats seem to run just a tad on the larger size.  For example, this Open Road Royal Deluxe in a size 7 1/8 was too large for me, however the size 7 was somewhat perfect.  If your hat arrives and is a just tad on the larger size or fits slightly loose, just slip a strip or two of regular kitchen paper towel inside the inner sweat band.   You&apos;ll figure out how long, short or thickness the paper towel strips should be.  It&apos;s the perfect way to get that perfect fit without going a size larger and finding out that 1/8 inch makes a ton of difference in sizing.  I love the color Sage and love this hat.   I wear it all the time.  I have a total of eight Open Road felt hats and six Open Road Straw hats.  Love &apos;em all.  It&apos;s a high quality product, Made in the USA.  Stetson is an icon in American Cowboy history.  Some past Presidents have been  photographed wearing a Stetson Road.",

Was excited for these new ones which supported USC C charging (because almost everyone these days has the new Apple lightening cable), as well as supporting the charging of multiple devices. Unfortunately, in order to re-charge the battery pack you need the specific USB A to USC C cable included with the battery pack. Most other battery packs (such as the older BioLite ones), as well as battery lanterns use a micro charger. Almost everyone in the world has a micro charger for charging various battery items. This battery pack will require you to carry around another cable or add another cable to your home charging station just to charge this device. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t read closely enough that the charging INPUT was USB-C. Knocking off one star. If the input for re-charging the battery pack would have been a micro charger, it would have been perfect.",

I am currently using it for day hikes when I am using a smart phone for its apps, and also a camera. First use: before leaving, I charged the extra battery. Over the day, my phone charge fell to about 65% (and I barely used the camera). In the car instead of plugging the phone into the car&apos;s charger, I used the Biolite battery. Over the ~2 hr drive home, it fully charged. Having this unit makes me feel more secure in case of mishaps on my hikes. I imagine the phone&apos;s re-charging was slower than a wall power source, but it met my needs and exceeded my expectations. On an off-the-grid trip, I imagine sunny weather would allow producing charge on my little Biolite panel, perhaps even while transferring it to this storage form. The battery can charge my phone, headlight and camera. I like how the various Biolite units can work together for day-trips or when away from the grid longer.",

I slept in it for 150 nights and never let me down! Great balance between weight, warmth, and price. However, I found it very narrow. I like to sleep with my legs forming a figure 4 shape, but it was impossible to do in this bag. I also rotate like a rotisserie chicken during the night and I got tangled in it a few times. A little bit cold when temperatures drop towards 0°C, especially when the bottom of the bag is exposed, as it is less insulated than the top. I had to wear my puffy for those nights or wrap it around my bum to keep it warm. Finally, I found it a bit bulky but it is overall a great product! I would recommend it to thru-hikers on a budget or anyone going on shorter trips.",

I have yet to have a sleep sufficiently warm enough even around 4-5 celsius, which is the lowest I have used this bad. I am not a cold person in general, but with this bag I have to wear multiple sets of thermals, multiple socks, and I have even resorted to taking a hot water bottle to bed to try and stay warm. I have had to now return to using my Asolo and Coleman bags, which are surprisingly much more warm, and only slightly larger/heavier. I really wanted this bag to work but it doesn&apos;t perform as marketed, and I am really disappointed in this Marmot product.",

Absolutely glides through the park with ease and reacts so well to what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nButtering on the board is great too not too stiff not too floppy just right for sure \r\n\r\nRode this board 2 days in mammoth , all mountain I would say it’s good, you can tell it’s main focus is park as stated on the specs.\r\n\r\nLove my setup and plan to lock in all my new tricks and clean up some old ones !!!",

It Looks white in the picture but in hands turns out a bit grey. Got white bindings with it and you can definitely notice the colour difference.\r\n\r\nNot complaining cause by the end of the day I’m getting better and better at Park! 🙌",

Teahouse rooms are unheated, and many are over 12,000&apos;. This warm, stretchy and comfortable liner helped keep my bag clean and me warm, the very few times I needed it for warmth.\n\nOnly 4 stars, because:\nMy StS bag has a separate zipper for the footbox, that I usually have open, even at high elevations and thought the liner would, too. I thought this because the pictures online (&amp; even the one StS attached to the email asking for this review), plus wording on the box state the bottom has a drawstring. It doesn&apos;t for the semi-rectangular version I needed. So, my dear spouse ripped the bottom open and sewed one in.\n\nStS did apologize for the incorrect wording on the package, and made it as right as they could.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve purchased the older version that&apos;s the super warm ones for fall camping in Colorado and it was super warm but a little bit challenging for me as I like to poke my feet out of the sleeping bag when I run hot. This design is superb with the option to cinch the feet and the snap buttons on top, really made it much user friendly for someone like me. This material is cooling, perfect for the upcoming summer camping. Super soft material, made it very easy to sleep in. Totally would recommend!",

        "reviewBody": "First of all, you NEED a liner for your sleeping bag. If you wash your bedding at home once a week—that being under ideal hygienic conditions where you shower every single day—you really don&apos;t want that funk getting into your expensive sleeping bag! That&apos;s where a liner really helps!\n\nThis liner is an upgrade for me. I&apos;ve been using a Sea-to-Summit Comfort Blend for several years, and I&apos;ve really liked that product a lot. But I thought a back-up liner might be nice. But I was really blown away with how nice the Breeze liner is! Mine is the regular Mummy style, and I really appreciate the soft, wicking material that the Breeze is constructed from. Apparently it&apos;s a similar material as the Tek towels (I think…maybe its one of the other towels?). I sleep hot, and I sweat a lot at night, so drawing that moisture off is a really nice feature. To help regulate my comfort (including at home) I usually stick my feet out of the end of the bed (and of the liner), so the opening at the bottom is actually a really welcome feature! Yeah…I don&apos;t wander the campsite in my liner, but I suppose you could if you wanted to. To each their own!\n\nAnyhow, I really love my new liner. What WAS going to be a spare is now my go-to!",

The snaps at the top mean you can have your arms free which is great for people who sleep with their hands behind or above their head. It is so easy to wash compared to a sleeping bag. I also have a Reactor liner and the Breeze liner is noticeably cooler to the touch. This is a great product for camping on warm summer nights!",

I&apos;m a hot sleeper plus I live in Texas, so this liner will honestly be enough even without the sleeping bag most of the time. I also love the idea of being able to use it in hotels or in travel situations if I&apos;m concerned about cleanliness. It&apos;s easy to pack and takes up almost no space.

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was happy to test out the Sea to Summit Breeze Sleeping Bag Liner complimentary through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I had never thought of using a liner before being introduced to this product, but this is actually quite useful. As someone who tends to get hot quite easily, especially while sleeping, this felt great on the skin. As soon as you envelope yourself in this liner, you get a nice cooling effect. The material is soft, lightweight and allows for movement, which adds to a comfortable sleep. This liner is shaped nicely with a hood, arm holes and an open bottom, so you could just wear this out and pull up the bottom if you need to get out of your sleeping bag in the middle of the night, and therefore, not leave this to get tangled in the bottom of the bag or struggle to get comfortably around you. I did notice the cooling sensation wear off while I slept, but I did not wake up drenched in sweat or feel like I was overheating as I often do.  I hand washed this in cold and hung it to dry and it was dry within the day. I believe with proper care this will hold up nicely as long as you do not snag it. Also, this comes with a travel pouch and takes up very little space and would be easy to travel with. I&apos;m very pleased with this product and find it to be a useful solution to hot sleepers like myself.",

I will have to have it repaired. While they are all medium sizes, there is a noticeable difference beetween the sleeves widths. The seams were also not well finished on the second one I received.\n\nI would have given 5 stars to the blue one I first got, but it seems the quality is not constant...",

The two I already own have gone through the wringer. I wear them from early fall through the spring here in CT, USA. I love the zippered kangaroo pocket and they’re easy to wash - I use a gentle cycle on “eco-warm”, vinegar in place of fabric softener (so bad for your clothes!!), and air dry. They both look brand new still.\n\nThe only issue is that I think the sleeves should be longer. I have kind of long arms though but they’re definitely shorter on my arms than I like.

This runs large just so you know but it is really nice to have a Lightweight fleece for any time of year. I use this around the house, skiing, and while playing disc golf. Love this piece, I wish they had more color options but black goes with everything so it works. I took this to Europe and was super stylish on both sides of the pond! Cheers!",

I have a very odd-shaped foot (low volume, but wide) and my previous boots I spent hours with an expert boot technician working to punch them and get them comfortable. \n\nThese out of the box fit great, they are very warm, and they have some great simple customization options (toe inserts for my lower volume foot and a calf insert to help with a more aggressive forward stance). I haven&apos;t needed to heat them or take them to a fitter. If the BOA system holds up it will be an amazing feature too because it makes is so much faster getting them on an off while skiing with my little kids! always a plus.\n\nWould highly recommend!",

Length of sleeves and torso are perfect and cant imagine going bigger for my height unless I weighed more. Fits a base layer and puffy fine. Definitely a little tight in the chest when layered though not super restrictive, so not a huge factor for the uphill. Inner mesh pockets aren&apos;t quite big enough to casually throw both skins in one, but that&apos;s a trade-off for the size of the external hand pockets. Otherwise, quality and durability are great. Removeable powder skirt is clutch. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.",

Not every piece of gear needs to be a fashion statement.\r\nLove &apos;em. Big thumbs up. Comfortable as hell. Durable. Easily slipped in and out of. Great multi-surface traction.

Are made too high so you can´t open your tailgate unless the rack is completely down with no bikes 2. are not easy to slide and adjust for different bike wheelbase lengths. Latching mechanism buttons have cheap feel to them and despite made to insert key locks, they are not supplied nor can I find locks for those on this website. Therefore, you have to use a cable lock to lock your bikes which is an added nuisance. Also, unfortunately not designed to use a through bolt with lock for hitch nor is one available for sale. This is essential to keep thieves from stealing entire unit from automobile in or not in use.  For the price, I am disappointed in the value of this unit, mostly for design reasons because you would think you could lock the unit and bikes in place.

One of the bikes is a full suspension and didn&apos;t have room to slide on to the arm style rack I was using.  This rack allows for some odd shaped frames to be secured.  The trays are big enough for some MTB tires as well.   There is a little more of a build to this rack than other Thule racks I&apos;m aware of, but works well.",

It is so comfortable and well fitting that I was even able to climb while wearing it because I just refused to take it off.  I looked like a mushroom in my photos, but I was a warm mushroom.  The pockets are well located and did not interfere with my harness.  The arms had full movement.  The bottom zip was adjustable to fit the harness as well.  The inside pockets hold everything.  Great purchase.  Well worth it.",

I like the adjustable hood bc usually hoods cover my face but this helps keep the hood on but not over my eyes. I went ice climbing in it and it held up well. This is saying a lot as I have full body contact in the ice as I climb with one leg. I took it to Michigan and it packed down well for the flights and was able to stuff into the suitcase just fine.",

I&apos;m partial to Di2 and Shimano, but I read about accuracy issues with dual sided PM&apos;s using the latest Ultegra/Dura-Ace crankset.  \nThis Quarq PM fit the bill perfectly to pair together with Dura-Ace Di2 and chainrings.  Looks fantastic and provides reliable power numbers.  I&apos;m also loving the MagicZero automatic zero offset that doesn&apos;t require you to zero offset before every ride.  Just hop on the bike and start riding.\nI&apos;m not a weight weenie but I did compare total weight of PM/crankset/BB to a comparable Shimano based setup.  Weight is within 10-15g.  Price is also competitive with the alternatives.\nVery happy with my purchase and 10/10 would buy again.",

When the shoes were wet, the insole became bunched up very quickly and I had to rip them out to keep going. Uncomfortable. \n3. The shoes force my ankles to over pronate inward which is not something I’m used to. It was like the shoe is trying to spin around my foot with every step. Awkward. \n4. They did dry quickly and have great grip but I have no confidence in these shoes anymore. \n\nI&apos;d like to return them.",

You would have to go with a latex tube or go tubeless for any less rolling resistance.  The plastic bag that they come in is perfect for holding a co2 inflator and adapter. Keep your flat repair kit nice and tight for your jersey pocket or like I do and have multiple in your saddle bag",

I go hiking every weekend and even once or twice after work during the week. This pack has quickly become my outdoor sidekick. My one and only complain is the fact the pack does not include load lifters. Luckily, the length is perfect for me. I have a long torso and the hip belt fits just right. If you have a short torso, this may not be the bag for you since you can&apos;t adjust this.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought after working out of a north face rucksack (I think it was called that) for a year. I&apos;ve got mine set up with three pouches; one on each side and one on the center portion covering the elastic cord that&apos;s placed there to dry wet stuff.\nBehind that pouch I have one or two carabiners attached to the cord. \n\nThis is used for daytrips, 1-2 day overnights in hotels or field stuff with already emplaced tents and cots. So external pouches will hold: jetboil like stove and pot with fuel cannister, 1lt steel bottle of water, and radio equipment and/or chargers mouse, power strip etc.\nInside is rain gear on the bottom, notebook carrrier with all the usual work stuffs, additional paperwork, and the laptop.\n\nThis bag was MAINLY bought for its HARD back with an internal laptop sleeve that was sewn a few inches above the bottom of the bag. I had a previous bag where the laptop sleeve went all the way to the bottom of the bag, \nand now i have a edge dented laptop as the bag was set down ever-not-so-gently. \n\nThe lid pouches are a work of dark magic I think, the internal and external pouches are seemingly bottomless and are perfect for all the little &quot;quick need to haves&quot;; headlamps, cell chargers, keys, cards, glasses, sunglasses, zyn, markers, gloves, etc.\n\nThe second reason this one was bought to replace my old bag was that it can zip from top to bottom on both sides. Enough bag dumps trying to get the thing that always seems to be at the bottom of the bag regardless of how you packed it.\n\nI&apos;ve hunted with it a few times; seemed a little big for that, but I don&apos;t carry that much stuff in the first place I guess. \n\nOther things: fits perfectly in an overhead compartment on planes (under the seat too if you ditch the center outer pocket), I don&apos;t have any opinion on using it as its intended purpose, that of a &quot;trekking&quot; backpack. I don&apos;t use it for that and have never worn it for longer distances than through\na large airport. It&apos;s comfy enough. I removed the waist belts as soon as I got it, so can&apos;t speak to those things. I&apos;ve never used the rain fly as, again, I don&apos;t use it for trekking for fun. It&apos;s a work bag. \n\nIt&apos;s a fantastic bag. Been using for about two years and which I had it for the past 15. Probably would still be standing where the others have fell by the way side.",

        "reviewBody": "This pack does not have two critical features for heavy loads.  It lacks an adjustable torso length, so the distance between hips and the shoulders is accommodated by the shoulder strap entirely, secondly, the pack lacks load lifters meaning that heavy loads will rotate the pack off the wearers back leaving a gap at the top of the shoulders and not transfer sufficient weight to the hip belt.  Needs adjustable torso and load lifters.  Recommend that there also be a square shaped pocket accessory for the front if/when those other design issues are addressed.  Would also recommend a non-UN Blue rain cover... for the entire Singi series.",

You can fit a lot in here and it will not put weight on your shoulders. Two things that  threw me off but I didn’t mind is that 1.) the velcro pouch makes a lot of noise and it would be better if it had a zipper and 2.) I got the bag in hummus and it doesn’t match the color in the image. It looks more like grass green than a cream beige color. Despite this, I still love my bag 100000/10 :)",

In order to fully upen the pocket, one needs to use both hands and it makes a lot of noise when the wide center hook strip lifts away. As the hook strips at each end are thin, however, a thief could easily lift one up and slip their hand inside. A zipper would&apos;ve been much more secure and more convenient.",

When I went to use it there was no charge available.  Plugged it in to a solar generator to charge it and then had very little run time.  Charged it again and then after another day the unit had lost almost all of its power.  Probably a great unit for plug and use, but when power is limited I need more reserve power.",

The terrain was insanely dusty so to be able to clean off each day prior to getting in the tent was a game changer. We also used the Kakadu for cleanup each night. Washing dishes with hot water was mind blowing. The unit heats up in no time at all and maintains a constant temp.",

I decided to order the velvet tan/sanguine for fun and the black to be practical.  I normaly wear a 11.5M, so I figured I&apos;d better order the 12M.  Right out of the box, the tan/sanguine color was just stunning.  But, as soon as I put these boots on my feet, I was like, &quot;What the heck!?!?!&quot;  These boots were so tight I had to double check the box and tongue, to make sure I got size 12.  I&apos;m not sure in what universe this is a 12M, but they aren&apos;t in mine.  Depending on what size you wear, I&apos;d caution against ordering these, unless you can go up at least 1.5 sizes.  Sadly, these are going back.",

So I reordered a full size up and both boots were deformed. The left boot has something poking out of the top on the inside that immediately hurt my foot as I tried it on. The right boot crushed my foot and was even smaller than the first size I purchased. They also had scuffs and loose threads.

Unfortunately they were still a little too snug so I ended up sending them back for a 9. They are amazing shoes though, so cute and very comfy. I&apos;ve worn them two days in a row all day and they felt great and I got a lot of compliments",

Folds up nicely when not in use which is a big plus since most heavy duty bike racks are threaded connections to the hitch, which makes taking it on/off a pain. Comes partially assembled already so it didn’t take much work to finish the assembly.",

Nice it comes with locks for both the rack and bike. \n\nMy E-bike is about 50 lbs  and I don’t see much movement at all while carrying the bike. \n\nMy one criticism so far is that the bike kickstand is on the left side of bike when loading which makes it difficult to get into position to lift. It would be nice if the rack was reversible. \n\nAlso I haven’t yet been able successfully to put one wheel at a time on the rack (to lessen the weight). Still working on it but it doesn’t seem conducive.",

          "Hi Aj! We are sorry to hear about your disappointment!\n\nThis jacket is made out of G-1000, which is not a waterproof fabric.\nAs the product description states, it is considered to be water resistant. However, water resistance means that the fabric itself is acting as the barrier between you and a light rain shower. Tightly woven fabrics offer a degree of water resistance because it takes some time for water to seep through the material.\n\nYou can read more about the different stages: https://foxtrail.fjallraven.com/articles/waterproof-vs-water-repellent-vs-water-resistant\n\nThe Greenland Wax offers the garment a higher level of water-resistance, but unfortunately not waterproofness."

I have all kinds of membranes for situations where I&apos;m trapped in downpours, but the thing I love about this anorak is that it&apos;s breathable and durable, and if I so please, I can add wax (which ins&apos;t what I want--this is an urban jacket for me). All the details are spot on; I like the firm grip of the snap that allows you to use the size zipper to dump heat rapidly. There&apos;s no silver bullet all-situations jacket out there, so it&apos;s not the fault of this product that people have specific qualities it never attempts to pitch.

They stuff easily into the jersey pocket, as do the empties. I wish they sold mixed packages of 24 because it&apos;s easy to tire of one flavor, no matter how tasty, and all flavors provide the same instant energy. It&apos;s really amazing how fast they work. So go ahead , make your own food and save money. I don&apos;t want to wait 20 minutes for my calories to kick in, and then lose speed unraveling my homemade wrappers and then dealing with the garbage. I&apos;d rather pay the money, slurp my GU, get and get virtually instant energy on the fly.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve been using this bib for over six months and I’m really happy with it. I don’t feel the sizing is off at all. I am 5’8” and 125 lbs and usually wear a small in leggings and pants from other brands and find that the small here fits well. I don’t mind the straps that have to go over your head. I wouldn’t have designed it like that, but it’s not bad. Many other ski bibs are like this. I like the long zipper down the side for ease of undressing for those quick restroom visits without having to take off your top layer. The pockets at the hip are convenient as is the chest pocket. The material has stood up to many days on the mountain without tears or snags, and I’ve skimmed a tree and taken a few nasty spills.  But the most important factor is it keeps me warm and dry while on the slopes without adding bulk! Would purchase again!",

I am returning and going to size up but that might not even be enough to provide adequate bend in the knees and accommodate base layers. I like the vents inside v. Mountain Hardware side vents. I just don’t understand the design and how the overall bib is suppose to be relaxed.",

After some extensive research I settled on the Baffin Borealis boots and I could not be more pleased. I was a bit hesitant of the double-boot system but I find the boots quite comfortable and extremely warm. As noted in a previous review, do not wear thick socks. You will struggle to get them on and your feet will become cold. The lace system is top notch. These do not come undone as the hook eyelets &quot;lock&quot; your laces in.  I have used these for two seasons now and they have not disappointed. I have not experienced wet feet as noted in a previous review and not for the lack of trying. The only &quot;issue&quot; if I had to call it one is that these fit so well, I used to struggle to get them on. I found a stand up shoe horn and now they slip on with ease.",

        "reviewBody": "Review below mentioned how they can get wet, which they can if water leaks between the shell and the neoprene tongue. If you take some seam sealer and get that seam packed up, these boots are then 100% waterproof from the top down.\n\nYou can also use an oven bag or food vacuum sealer bag to line the boot outside of the liner, which also makes the boots 100% waterproof as any water that does get past the seams will not get into the insulation.\n\nAs far as the boots performing in general, think of them as the lightest and most walking-friendly double boot system out there. They&apos;re like the trail runners of double shell and liner winter boots. They hike very comfortably.\n\nFor cold days, since these boots are very form-fitting without a lot of sloppy room for thick socks, you are best off with thinner wool or synthetic socks for staying warm. If you wear socks too thick in these boots, it can cut off circulation and make the toes colder. \n\nI use mine primarily for wet weather and snow sports like snowshoeing and cross country skiing. I have the Black Diamond Glidelite 147 XC skis which are like snowshoes in that they strap onto just about any boot.",

I’ve gotten compliments every time I’ve worn it and it’s always with me in case I feel chilled. I work in a hospital setting so it’s frequently very cool at night. I’d love to see a full zip version of this jacket!! For me I have a long torso and long arms and I appreciate that I can use the thumb holes without feeling like it being pulled at the shoulder.

        "reviewBody": "This is literally the best board I have ridden in 20+ years of snowboarding. The reason I say that, it makes the entire mountain fun, which I hope is why we all snowboard. I was skeptical at first, is this a powder board, is it some niche thing that will sit in my snowboard collection and collect dust. It is exactly the opposite. I want to ride this board everyday and everyday that I ride it, it is amazing. I can take this out on ‘Link Laps’ with my kids and then go charge hard the next day with my compadres. And best of all, this board makes each turn feel soulful and satisfying.  What more can you ask for? And the same goes for the Cardiff Crew. I would buy any board from them, because the stoke they have, shines through in the products they make. Amazing board, amazing people. If you can find anything better than that, please let me know where.",

I&apos;m an 11.5 or 12 street shoe and 45 is very tight, very high toe curl fit\n\nPerformance is awesome. Plenty of big toe power even though it is a really soft, sensitive, sticky feel. I&apos;d pick a stiffer shoe for really sustained front pointing",

        "reviewBody": "Been using these for a few months now. They have great sensitivity and precision, much more than other stiffer shoes I own. You can really feel the footholds and gives me a lot of trust in my feet. I primarily use them for rope climbing, but are pretty good for bouldering as well.\n\nSizing: I normally wear a 43 street shoe, I ordered a 41.5 in these. Took about a month of climbing to fully break in. They were pretty painful at first, primarily due to your big toe being pushed up against the rubber of the top toe box. After they stretched some, they have a really good fit for my feet, and are fairly comfortable and form to my feet very well. I would probably advise against sizing down as much as I did to avoid the pain of the break in period. I have another pair of scarpas that I ordered 1 size down and they fit pretty well and are slightly more comfortable but still a snug fit.",
