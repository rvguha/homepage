      "reviewBody": "This classic is filled with vivid images that stay in your mind after you have watched it, and there is a lot to appreciate in the way that the key scenes were set up and photographed. The visuals are so impressive that the movie&apos;s imperfections are usually not so noticeable, and they don&apos;t keep it from being a memorable film.\n\nThe movie certainly deserves the praise that it gets both for the influence that it has had, and for some ideas that for the time were most creative. The famed &apos;Odessa Steps&apos; sequence alone demonstrates both fine technical skill and a keen awareness of how to drive home an image to an audience. It deserves to be one of cinema&apos;s best remembered sequences. Some of the other scenes also demonstrate, to a lesser degree, the same kind of skill.\n\nIt says a lot for how effective all of the visuals are that so many viewers think so highly of &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; despite a story that is sometimes heavy-handed, and despite characters and acting that are both rather thin. These features might simply stem from the collectivist philosophy that lies behind the story, and they are obscured most of the time by Eisenstein&apos;s unsurpassed ability to present pictures that viewers will not forget.\n\nDespite the flaws, this is a movie that most fans of silent films, and anyone interested in the history of movies, will want to see. There&apos;s nothing else in its era that&apos;s quite like it."

Anyway, while this may feel like Eternity, the movie is not that far of a stretch ... or any kind of a stretch ... although maybe a different kind of ... well you know what I mean - hopefully.\n\nAs with most other movies I did watch this with audio commentary. Stormy and the director have a lot to say about the making and of course certain scenes. Fire hazards (hay and candles do not really mix together) and stuff that you may want to hear or not. There is always interesting stuff - and Stormy is quite eloquent. Way more than ... others. Let&apos;s leave it at that. And no I will not do puns about her mouth - you do that on your own. The movie itself may not be as filled with humor as other efforts have been, but the audio commentary more than makes up for it.",

This movie deals nothing with bi-polar, but looks like they gave someone a camera to follow around, who doesn&apos;t have the slightest clue of the disease, and the research that when into the film, is laughable at best. The Best series I&apos;ve seen that comes close is Stephen Fry&apos;s The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive. This guy is this film, just doesn&apos;t want to do anything, like get a job, wake up, he thinks the camera man is his therapist. Anyone can ab lib this horrible peace of film making.",

You can understand why the protagonist turns away at any chance of a normal life and instead concentrates on nothing but revenge. And it is undeniably satisfying to see him enact his revenge any chance he gets. \n\nIt&apos;s good for what it is, though there are some problems, that if tweaked, could have made the movie even better. For one thing, casting McQueen as a half-Indian? And casting this mid-30s actor as a character that&apos;s supposed to be young enough to be called &quot;Kid&quot;!?!? Plus, the escape from the swamp doesn&apos;t seem finished; in fact, with the short sequence where one of McQueen&apos;s pursuers commenting on the bullets he has left makes me believe that several minutes were edited out before the movie was released."

      "name": "Almost Christmas is inoffensive and got some laughs out, but not enough to make it a holiday tradition",
      "reviewBody": "We&apos;re only a week away from Thanksgiving, and yet most people seem to be planning their holiday season before they even think about turkey. While I wish that the November holiday got a little more attention, who can blame people from wanting to bring in the magic of the Christmas season? Our world is now dazzled in bright lights, red and green colors all over, and a chance to better relationships. Something about life seems warmer whether were selecting a tree or the living room, lighting a new candle for Chanukah, or simply wishing someone a better new year.\n\nFor a lot of people, the holidays mean having to visit family. I think it&apos;s safe to say that no matter who we love, there is at least one person in your family that you&apos;d rather not speak to on a daily basis. So why do we put a lot of focus on our family gatherings if we know that things won&apos;t change? I think it&apos;s a matter of both keeping tradition, but of also gratefulness. The odd feeling with family is at least some feeling as we could be in a position without any loved ones (like how some people are unfortunately in that position). One family in Almost Christmas deals with a father trying to bring his kids together without drama. \n\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, the Meyers family seems to be a nice crew of people to be with around the holidays. The patriarch, Walter (played by Danny Glover) is a retried mechanic who has let his wife Grace handle the majority of the meal planning while letting their four children run amok. Tragically, Grace dies from an unspecified heart condition, making Walter question just how he can handle his old home and keeping his adult children together.\n\nFirst to arrive is his eldest daughter Charyl (played by Kimberly Elise) who is a dentist and has brought her husband former basketball star Lonnie (played by J.B. Smoove) and their daughter. Next is eldest son Malachi (played by Romany Malco) who is trying to spend time with his family while running for congress. Then we have youngest daughter Cheryl (played by Kimberly Elise), whose seems to be in between jobs while raining her daughter. Finally we have youngest son Evan (played by Jessie Usher) who is a football star at his college. Oh, and Grace&apos;s sister aunt May (played by Mo&apos;Nique) Can Walter manage to keep the family at peace in his first Christmas without his wife?\n\nThe trouble with trying to get out a good Christmas movie (and I LOVE Christmas films) is all about creating realistic conflict that we can relate to and why the holidays are a good time to resolve them. Almost Christmas plays off like a lot of those television movies on Hallmark, which usually means that their never great. This is defiantly no Christmas Vacation, Home Alone, or Elf, but this is far from even the worst. The movie has its moments where it&apos;s drama seems genuine, especially whenever it focuses on Danny Glover and his children.\n\nWhile I&apos;d like to follow Glover, the rest of the family doesn&apos;t have much interesting. I don&apos;t blame it on the actors, but the script gives them cliché moments like the cheating husband, the father that works too hard, or the grief of loosing a mother. I don&apos;t have a problem with any of this, but Almost Christmas doesn&apos;t find any new ways to tell that story. As I said, actors like Danny Glover, Mo&apos;Nique, and J.B. Smoove did get a laugh out of me and are enough to keep the movie going when it needs to.\n\nI&apos;ll give this five sweet potato pies out of ten. At it&apos;s worst, its boring. But at it&apos;s best, it&apos;s inoffensive. As far as Christmas movies goes, I could easily see this playing on a Sunday afternoon on Hallmark or TNT. Those that aren&apos;t bothered by tired story elements will probably find this one passable. I doubt I&apos;ll spend more time with the Meyers family, but don&apos;t see any reason for other people to join them.",

In the days were you can find marihuana like almost anywhere they managed to have the worst imitation fake marihuana ever shown on a filmset. They really didn&apos;t know any dopehead to just borrow his weed for a second? I think for that alone they should get a prize. The alien costumes were actually the only things that were okay. The acting was seriously bad, aspecially from Sabina Gadecki as Peggy. That was just unreal how bad it was. I think she might really have been on drugs in this movie. The story is what it is, not the worst but due to all the bad ingredients it&apos;s just a terrible movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The biggest mistake you can make going into iBoy is expecting something from the Marvel catalog.\n\nCause that is simply not going to happen.\n\nInstead what you get is a solid Brit &quot;estate gang&quot; story (like Harry Brown 2009 or a dozen others you could probably recite from memory) with some Marvel/Spiderman superhero stuff cleverly thrown in.\n\nAnd that is a mouthful because I have watched and reviewed a lot of films (check out my list, about 1300) and have never seen anything quite like this before.\n\nDoes it work? For the most part, YES. There are some pacing issues here and there, and it takes a while for the young lead to develop a character arc that the audience is comfortable with, but the suspense/payoff is rock-solid and nail-biting; and the close is edgy but respectful and optimistic.\n\nThe two best performances come from supporting actors -- another oddity.\n\nMaisie Williams steals every scene not otherwise nailed down and does so with a sweetness of character that makes you wish you knew someone like her when you were in school.\n\nAnd Rory Kinnear as the arch-villain almost but not quite moves into the rarefied air of a Bond film -- you keep waiting for him to say &quot;WHAT DO I WANT IBOY, I WANT YOU TO DIE&quot; -- but shows enough restraint to keep from falling over the edge.\n\nIn short, given the brilliant idea, the solid execution and its ability to keep the viewer both offguard and entertained at the same time, this a fun flick deserving of a higher IMDb score than I am seeing.\n\nRecommended!",

Had three kids with me...14 yr old 8 yr old and 6yr old who all sat watching it, enjoying it and laughing away. Me too. Tim Allen was great as usual and def suits the comedy side of acting. Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn&apos;t the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn&apos;t the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great, Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were great(nice to see Downey in something), some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this, seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing",

The voyager is traveling our milky-way with the sounds of our earthly lives, as a space monument for (possible?) extraterrestrials. \n\nThe documentary contains footage of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. The footage of J.B. has never been published before. The narrative is from &apos;blind Willie&apos; Dixon. However, it&apos;s done by an actor. The film shows the work of all these early blues men followed by covers and interpretations by musicians, such as Nick Cave and the bad Seeds among others. \n\nThe Death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall&apos;s song) is a striking event in the story. Lenoir got political engaged and is considered to be of the league of Martin Luther King and peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics. \n\nBlues is found to be &apos;THE&apos; native music of America. Blues is the roots and the rest is the fruits.\n\nThe title &apos;Soul of a Man&apos; is after a Willie Dixon song.",

The violin playing and dancing, though, aren&apos;t nearly as good as in the 1962 version, and the dancing, with knickers showing all over the place, is kind of sleazy.

In the beginning, as I was sitting in the cinema and the characters came marching in, one by one, without any order I was scared. Csoki arrived with his old motorbike, carrying loads of beer and shouted &quot;Easy Rider my bro!&quot; as in the movie before. It seemed it would be nothing more than the first Üvegtigris re-told. But later the actor-director Péter Rudolf (Lali in the movie) came up with bright ideas, which went over the standard before: A funeral where the mayor&apos;s speech makes everyone laugh, the two stock-policeman characters, who try to run in front of their own speed cameras to exceed the limits themselves as no one is around. Scenes like these make the audience laugh. The most brilliant parts in the movie are the bits which look like music videos a&apos;la Hungarian style. Being a bit like a &quot;re-make&quot; of the previous Üvegtigris, the movie fails to come up with a totally satisfactory effect on the audience. There is one thing, however that has a brilliant conception: the sense of being alone depicted. The sense that time has stopped, that nobody cares. With all their swears, all their jokes and easiness, the guys are a bunch of losers after all, stuck in the Hungarian reality. Watch it if you liked the first part, forget it if you did not!",

Bring back the old movies and maybe people will learn something about unity.It&apos;s a heart-warming film and those who don&apos;t get that just don&apos;t GET IT. I had to watch this again after President Reagan passed away and it made me sad in a whole new way.Things took on a different meaning but that&apos;s okay.

      "reviewBody": "The story: A dentist, played by Ricky Gervais, is sick of dealing with people. Not just a few people; everyone. Social niceties annoy him and &quot;just being friendly&quot; is out of the question. But this doesn&apos;t prevent annoying chatter from following him to his dental practice or even to the hospital where he must undergo his first colonoscopy. While the doctors roll him down a corridor on a gurney, chatting about frivolous nonsense, he interrupts and insists on full anesthesia for the examination.\n\nThe Problem: Once back on the street, he realizes he can see people that others cannot. He returns to the hospital and asks the doctor if anything unusual happened during the procedure. The doctor&apos;s reticence does not deter him from wrenching the truth from her that, technically speaking, he was dead for &quot;almost 7 minutes&quot;. As a result, he can now see ghosts. And of course, they all want something from him.\n\nThe &quot;something&quot; that one particular ghost, Frank (Greg Kinnear), wants is for him to intervene in the romance of Frank&apos;s widow. At first reluctant to take on the task, he finally is blackmailed into to trying to break up her relationship and soon, he begins to enjoy the challenge.\n\nThe film rises above the hackneyed &quot;invisible man&quot; jokes and plays out as a fresh comedy romance. Not fresh on plot, admittedly, but on Gervais&apos; style. True, it&apos;s the same character he always plays, but seeing it long-form and with the love interest,it&apos;s satisfying. The romance in the plot calls for a performance that offers more than a tortured look or a snarky comment - and Gervais delivers.\n\nThere are no weepy &quot;But I love you&quot; scenes. There are touching moments, however, that are more akin to &quot;classic&quot; Hollywood, rather than the big-budget, ruin-the-characters, 4th-installment, CGI festivals that are the hallmark of Tinseltown these days. Worth seeing. Our packed-house audience laughed out loud and applauded the ending.",

      "reviewBody": "Films like this one were released by the bucket load in the 1980&apos;s, but as 1990 approached; they became less and less common. Still, there are a lot of silly horror flicks that were released in the 90&apos;s debut year, and, surprisingly, this one isn&apos;t all that bad. It lacks all the elements that make great films great films, of course; things such as brains, coherency and any whisper of characters has been neglected in favour of monster special effects and a few nice death scenes; but seriously, that&apos;s all you want from a film like this, so to say that Graveyard Shift does it&apos;s job isn&apos;t wrong. The film is based on a short story by Stephen King. Nearly everything that King has ever touched has been turned into a film, with a lot of mixed results. I would put this one in the middling category, which isn&apos;t a bad place to be in considering all the failed adaptations. The plot is typically thin (it is a SHORT story!) and it follows a man who gets a job in a cotton mill. The place is infested with rats, and after being charged with cleaning the place up, our hero finds a trapdoor and soon he and his team are up against the reason rats have made their home in the mill...\n\nOne thing that really stands out about this film is the atmosphere. Director Ralph S. Singleton delights in presenting a fetid and disturbing aura around the central location, and this helps the story massively and gives the film an almost &apos;odyssey&apos; approach when the characters finally make their way underground. I don&apos;t find rats scary, personally, but many people do and this film could easily be a reason why! The way that the rats surround the characters is brooding and frightening and provides the film with one of it&apos;s key elements. Acting definitely isn&apos;t a key element of Graveyard Shift, but the appearance of popular cult actor Brad Dourif will please many of this films&apos; audience. I&apos;m not a massive of fan of Dourif personally, but I respect his ability to shine in campy productions. The story doesn&apos;t offer anything in the way of a point, and it&apos;s incoherency will annoy many - but if you go into this film with the right sort of expectations, and don&apos;t think you&apos;re about to see a horror classic, Graveyard Shift really shouldn&apos;t disappoint.",

In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. The &apos;moral&apos; of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It&apos;s a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS.",

      "reviewBody": "The title of this film isn&apos;t very catchy, even in the original French, but it gives fair warning of what&apos;s to come: a motion picture in which much is to be endured and little is to be enjoyed. Tout un hiver is a glimpse at cross-cultural encounters that might put a Swiss mountain farm couple&apos;s hardship into perspective when the husband gets to know some refugees from Kosovo who&apos;ve suffered much greater horrors. Jean (Aurélian Recoing) and his wife Laure (Marie Matheron) have lost most of their livestock in a fire that killed their five-year-old daughter. Laure has lost her mind as a result and Jean puts her into a psychiatric clinic, a step that Laure&apos;s possessive sister Valérie (Nathalie Boulin) seems to ill approve of.\n\nJean must get work at a steel mill to pay debts and that is where he meets the Kosovar refugees working there, including Kastriot (Blerim Gjoci) and his sister Labinota (Gabriela Muskala). Jean is drawn to Labinota, perhaps because she seems as grief-ridden and bereft as he does. Her husband disappeared six years ago when soldiers murdered a whole community. He may have been killed, or he may have escaped, but she is still waiting. Kastriot is friendly to Jean and invites him to Kosovar social gatherings; he hides his own traumas but at times has a short fuse. The Kosovars have seen their families raped, their throats cut, their houses burned to the ground.\n\nThe harsh but spectacular Jura mountain landscapes are a big player in this film. Cinematographer Witold Pióciennik&apos;s cinematography is impeccable and sometimes uniquely lovely. His close-ups of the principals spare us nothing---there&apos;s no escape from the fact that Recoing&apos;s and Gjoci&apos;s faces are genuinely expressive but the two ladies are overplaying their melodramatic roles, Matheron far too exaggeratedly nutty, and Muskala too pathetic and sweet.\n\nJean considers selling everything and moving somewhere else: a new start. Laure, who is perhaps beginning to become coherent again, is not enthusiastic. But like the rest of the story, this issue is something we keep going back and forth on without any resolution.\n\nThere&apos;s heavy-handed symbolism about crows against the snow, fire forbidden in the farm and big fire at the steel mill. Where is the Polish-born and trained Swiss-adopted director Zglinski going with all this? The editing is relentlessly arc-less: when we think Laure may be better we glimpse her engaging a a long mad scream of pain. Though Laure comes out of the clinic, and Jean has some warm times with the quietly accepting and ultimately cheerful Labinota, there&apos;s no sense of resolution; no sense indeed that we&apos;ve gotten anywhere. Zglinski is obviously interested in the contrast between the warm Kosovars (parallel to the warmer and wilder Poles he knows from his own experience) and the more stoical and shut-down Swiss. But that&apos;s just a given, not a source of any revelations. As if the parents&apos; terrible grief weren&apos;t enough, everything else seems exaggerated. The Kosovars are a little too celebratory and unpredictable. The insurance assessor is a dry, mincing creep out of Dickens. The possessive sister almost seems to have a lesbian attachment to Laure. The steel mill camaraderie has a consistently menacing and nasty air about it. One leaves with a sodden feel of unmitigated grimness.\n\nSeen at the SFIFF April 2006.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, which has the look &amp; feel of a docu-drama with authentic sets, scenery &amp; standout costumes [when needed ;)], strives &amp; succeeds in addressing two areas of socio-political history: human sexuality in general and a full rendering of gay &amp; lesbian characters in popular culture and historic contexts.  Rosa von Praunheim presents his characters with seriousness, gentleness &amp; humor in THE EINSTEIN OF SEX, so that we get the idea that &quot;darkness&quot; in life can be confronted in as many hues and shades as comedy, romance &amp; adventure genres. And that darkness is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nModern society lacks a serious study of human sexuality, so Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld&apos;s story should be a cue for a movement in that direction.  Some of the humor in the film is around this very fact - that we giggle at the sight of beautifully crafted male genital adornments from aboriginal cultures, yet we still find it difficult to approach the complexity of our sexual selves with the courage &amp; empathy that Hirschfeld&apos;s character does. We will never know the lost segments of his writings &amp; life events, but the fleshed out remnants in this film are an indication that we will not know ourselves truly until we know ourselves wholly and in diversity.  THE EINSTEIN OF SEX is also an important work in terms of gay &amp; lesbian visibility on film.  Though set in a different time &amp; setting than PRIEST, it will have a similar strong impact on viewers.  For anyone who might want to learn more about the distressing effects of oppression on human beings, this is the kind of film I&apos;d recommend and encourage more of from Hollywood-washed artists.",

Our church is one of the few Catholic churches in our area that fully supports the GLBT community and is trying to change church doctrine. We were both glad we went. The filmmakers point out how the misuse of the Bible by Judeo-Christian leaders has created not only an environment that leads to shaming but also condones &quot;sanctified violence&quot; projected toward gays and lesbians. The film also addresses the real reasons why people are afraid to admit homosexuality is real and normal. I was so moved by this film I feel if everyone was at least willing to see it then it would open a dialog desperately needed in our country.",

This movie is alike to many of other French movies that I saw before which contains little or minimal dialogue. It conveys the message through showing &quot;symbolic scenes&quot;.\n\nHowever what troubles me the most is not such &apos;absence of dialogue&apos; but rather the clarity and sense of direction in the film. The love that grow between Simon and Matthew is only evident somehow in the middle of the film but for the rest - it is clearly unclear of what Simon thinks or at least other characters should have played greater role to clarify the role of the main character. As a result of this unclarity - all scenes appear to be just randomly and awkwardly put in.\n\nThe movie is incredibly slow. There is no significant or notable progression that the audience should be rewarded after watching the film for around 2 hours.\n\nAside from the talented and good looking actor Gaspard Ulliel (who played Simon), there is no other aspects of either in the story or plot that makes me eager to recommend this film to the general audiences.\n\n5 out of 10",

Whether you are familiar with Kubrick&apos;s history, or not, the information is very interesting. Despite the platitudes, the overall insight provided by the interviews and the observations of the narrator give you an excellent understanding of what made Stanley Kubrick a genius.",

      "reviewBody": "One Minute To Zero is a cold war film about Korea, very typical of its time.  President Truman called it a police action, like we were going there to arrest Kim Il Sung and his cronies.  It sure looked like a war from the point of view of the World War II veterans and their younger brothers who fought it.\n\nRobert Mitchum plays one of those veterans, a career army man who rose from the ranks to become a Colonel.  He&apos;s training the South Korean Army when the North attacks.  His personal story is interwoven with the progress of the war from the initial attack until the landings at Inchon. Mitch is every inch the combat soldier in this film.\n\nAnd Mitch falls big time for widow Ann Blyth, a United Nations worker. When the UN was founded post World War II a lot of people put hope and faith in it that it would prevent future wars and it would deter aggression with force if need be.  The only reason it got into Korea was because the Russians were boycotting the Security Council at the time and couldn&apos;t veto anything.  A gambit they never used again. Ann is a World War II widow who believes she&apos;s carrying out the ideals her husband fought for.  Lots of folks felt that way back in 1950.\n\nDirector Tay Garnett did a good job editing in real combat footage with his actors.  The film has a good sense of realism.\n\nBut it&apos;s a good romantic story as well, helped along by one of the most durable popular songs in history.  When I Fall In Love came from this film, heard in the background but never sung.  Curious because Ann Blyth is an excellent singer.  Nat King Cole and Doris Day had hit records of it when the film was first out.  Later on Etta James, The Lettermen, Donny Osmond, Natalie Cole all did well by this song.  And right up to the present day Celine Dion and Clive Griffin did a duet record back in 1993.  The good ones always survive and I wouldn&apos;t bet against a future hit single for some artist with this one.\n\nThere is one scene in this that would definitely jar today&apos;s audiences. At one point Mitchum directs his men to fire into a group of refugees who the North Koreans are using as a blind to smuggle men and arms into the South.  And the movie makes sure you see that that was the case. I don&apos;t doubt such things happened.  They&apos;re happening today.  But the movie verdict acquits Mitchum and assuages Ann Blyth that she shouldn&apos;t doubt her man.  What CNN would do with that today.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Charles McGraw, Wally Cassell, and William Talman.  All do a good job.\n\nIt&apos;s a double treat.  Lots of action for the men and plenty of romance for the women, or the other way around if that&apos;s what floats your boat.",

      "reviewBody": "hi, looking at the poster makes you think it might be just another teen/high school/college movie about love, friends etc. but this movie did surprise me a lot in terms of plot and made me laugh without using the f word but instead by using clever dialogs and many small scenes.\n\nIt is a movie about a troubled Asian American men (Ken) in his late twenties - a wannabe actor, without job, financially still depended on his dad, whom he cant get along with. at the same time, he gets to know a young 16 year old gorgeous (Hayden) high school girl, whom he really likes, but having the age difference in his head, his moral tells him not to take advantage of that situation. His life suddenly changes when inherited a house in shanghai and he decides moving there to find his own identity and to accept the fact he is not only amercan, but also Chinese.\n\nlike any other romance movies, the movie also starts off a little bit cheesy in the beginning, where the two main antagonists meet each other in the bus. But behind that, the movie differs a lot from the usual concept of a romance movie. The main plot is basically about a man&apos;s journey finding meaning in life, at the same time involved in a love relationship which is socially not acceptable due to the age difference. Besides the thoroughly thought dialogs, the unique plot, what I personally like most is the way Asian American man is portrayed here. He is not some math nerd, some kung fu guy, he is just some normal guy who is fun and troubled at the same time. Like you and me. This movie is definitely suitable of watching with your girlfriend/date, but it can also be enjoyed by watching alone.\n\ni am going to order it as soon as it is available in Germany, and if you find any grammatical mistakes, you can keep it for yourself!",

      "reviewBody": "My wife and I watched this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. It is set either on an island off the Florida coast, or a nearby Caribbean Island where US money is used, but is actually filmed in Mauritius east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Lots of background music is Louisiana Cajun music, an interesting combination.\n\nThis movie is really interesting and good but has a somewhat low IMDb rating because many viewers expected a straightforward narrative, I suppose. The opening shot gives us a hint of what is happening, the face of a young teenage boy, then into his eye, which expands to a fishing boat in the ocean. The captain of that boat, the Serenity, is Matthew McConaughey as Baker Dill.\n\nThe details can be gleaned by reading any of several user reviews with &quot;Spoilers&quot;, suffice to say it has elements that reminded me of movies like &quot;Frequency&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix.&quot; It is woven together well as a young boy, a genius in computer games, tries to deal with an abusive stepfather. But not everything is as we see it.\n\nBoth of us enjoyed the movie. I particularly like McConaughey and he is really good in this role."

In 2047 most people are connected and on universal basic income, no worries about real-life concerns. The execution, however, is poor and wastes an opportunity to make film history, no exaggeration here. Acting is generally ok, and actually it is good from the main and supporting roles.\n\nHowever, the screenwriting is severely lacking, and drags everything down. This movie should be structured around the dilemma of whether to free or not the connected people (possibly against their will), and, secondly, on the truth about the protagonist&apos;s wife. But we only get a couple of hasty minutes of these themes, and instead *a lot* of exposition on the protagonist&apos;s online quests (which I was skipping), which was worthless beyond some point. So much screen time was wasted. The culmination of the movie should undoubtedly be the hacking attempt of the megacorp HQs, but this was also hastily presented in a couple of minutes. .Such a wasted opportunity for an awesome film climax..!\n\nStill, 7/10 for the nice concept and the effort.",

Unlike the few other American Revolution films Hollywood has made, this one was both interesting and did an excellent job in conveying WHY the Colonists were rebelling and didn&apos;t paint the British as total buffoons or Nazis (like in THE PATRIOT). Plus, the main character&apos;s father-in-law is a loyalist, so the real tensions that existed within families was given decent treatment. As an American History teacher, I must point out that despite coming from Hollywood in 1940, the realism in spirit is quite surprising and I could recommend this to kids, as they&apos;d learn a lot.\n\nIt was odd to see Cary Grant as a bit of a rag-tag outdoorsman, but he carried it off better than I&apos;d expected. Plus, his British accent really wouldn&apos;t have been out of place in the Colonies at that time.\n\nAnother big plus for the film was the relationship between Grant and his sons. Yes, it&apos;s a bit manipulative, but I really liked the way the writers dealt with this relationship in the movie. All in all, an excellent film.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most underrated films ever. Battle of Britain is a great movie about the glorius British Royal Air Force in their famous halt to a German invasion and their ability to stop the Germans from Bombing the cities out of existance. Some of the special effects are kind of cheesy but they didn&apos;t have Industrial Light and Magic. I&apos;m very impressed about the Cinematography by Freddie Young. Why didn&apos;t he receive an Oscar nomination? The aerial photography was excellent. One complaint I will make about the DVD version is that the Main Credits have been changed, The music was credited to Sir William Walton in the DVD. On the VHS, Ron Goodwin composed the score, I don&apos;t know why they changed this on the DVD. They also changed the music at the end credits of the movie which I thought wasn&apos;t appropriate for some reason. Other than that, this is a great movie with a great cast."

      "reviewBody": "THE LOST is one of the most disturbing real life movies I have ever seen, period. I thought Ketchum&apos;s &quot;Girl Next Door&quot; was about as disturbing as you can get, based on a true life crime, but this one is much worse and very graphic. Actually, Ketchum took two real crimes, the first about two women that get shot in a woods because some psycho thinks they are lesbian, and the other crime which occupies the rest of this movie. Ray Pye is a twenty-something psycho, that with his good looks and car and crap attracts a few followers and girls in this small town. He puts smashed beer cans in his boots to make him seem taller. The movie moves ahead four years, after the girls in the woods are killed, and Ray is having a ball, balling who ever he wants, and partying and drugs and the whole nine yards. But his egomaniac world is starting to come crashing down along with his sanity, when his girls start to turn against him, especially the beautiful Katherine (Robin Sydney). He pretty much goes berserk, and the last twenty minutes or so of this movie are very hard to watch, even for this old gorehound. It turns into almost a cross between Last House on the Left and the Manson murders. Ray even references the Manson murders when he takes his hostages into an unsuspecting couples cabin, with a young couple, the wife being pregnant. Even Jack Ketchum says in the commentary how difficult the last twenty minutes were for even him to watch. This is incredibly brutal material folks, and the director holds nothing, and I mean nothing back. Ray looks to me like a young Tom Cruise, or maybe a cross between a young Elvis and Tom Cruise, that seems to be the look he is going for. When he snaps, and I mean snaps, it&apos;s like the devil himself has taken him over. This is a hell of a movie, and it did make me flinch a little, and that to me is very impressive. Not for the easily offended for sure, but for everybody else, put &quot;The Lost&quot; on your Want List immediately!!!!!!!!!!!! I could not recommend this extremely disturbing movie any higher. Very very well made by the way.",

It transpires that they all have various motives for searching for a Nazi scientist in a lost city, but none of the revelations are very convincing. The actors have done better work, some of them have been in great movies (Donald Pleasance, Robert Vaughn) but none of them would be proud of this. It&apos;s purely a case of them taking the money and running. Even the jungle backdrop is under-used. You&apos;d think that a film set in the jungle would at least have pretty scenery and some spectacular photography....but oh no, not this one!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Le départ d&apos;Arlequin et de Pierrette&quot; is a very early film by the French director, Alice Guy. And, like most of her early work, the film is very brief...and, unfortunately, also in rather poor shape. Most silent films made in the early days have disappeared...due to the ravages of time on nitrate film stock. This is because this type of film tends to decompose or explode rather easily! So, as you watch this short, cut it some slack as at least it does exist...even in a rather messy condition.\n\nAs for the film, it consists of some women dancing about. What exactly they are doing is confusing as is seeing the traditional character Pierrot (from the Italian &apos;Commedia dell&apos;arte&apos;) in the form of a lady instead. Exactly what they do is uncertain...but they share a kiss at the end...and you wonder if this was supposed to be a lesbian plot. It&apos;s all in hand-painted color (with each cel being hand painted!).\n\nOverall, difficult to enjoy but an important film due to its age and the renewed interest and reappraisal of Alice Guy&apos;s work.",

A bunch of gals are kidnapped and are shipped off (rape, whipping, bouncing french buttocks, probably a little inserted footage from some old pirate film) to America to become army prostitutes (rape, whipping, bouncing buttocks... sigh... lots of footage of cowboys and indians, storming of forts etc. from the 1960s Eurociné western-adventure The Last of the Mohicans). Typically bland direction, stiff acting and sub par camera work... and as often when watching routine Eurociné sleaze your mind immediately numbs and starts playing &quot;find the stock footage&quot; in self-defense. OK film, I had hoped for more pirate stuff but it was more a dirty western. The most enjoyable thing for me was seeing that creepy, bald Eurociné regular who always plays rapist as an Indian in warpaint!",

      "reviewBody": "Wrong Turn is about a group of 6 people (in two different cars) make a wrong turn (hence, the movie title) in the back woods of West Virginia. One car runs over some barbed wire which leaves them stranded in the middle of the road, when another car crashes into it due to not paying attention. They are in the middle of a forest where cell phones get no reception and not a gas station or any other convenience for miles and miles. Most of the group decide to walk back the way they came in hopes of finding help while a couple stay behind with the vehicles. This is where the mountain men begin their murder spree. They obviously began well before the movie started but for these 6 people, this is where it starts. It is also probably the most graphic and creepy part of the movie.\n\nThe special effects on the mountain men were great. They remind me of someone but I can not put my finger on it. They were creepy enough in the way they walked and grunted that they were not too much of a joke. I would probably run from these people if I was alone in the woods. Much better than the Boogeyman from Boogeyman, anyways. Some characteristics remind me of the main monster in Monster Man, though.\n\nI thought the cast for this movie was great. I have always been a big fan of Eliza Dushku and the other two girls, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Lindy Booth, were no slouches themselves. In fact, if there were 3 girls to be stranded somewhere with, I would have no problem if it were these 3. You could certainly do a lot worse.\n\nThe only guy in the movie that annoyed me was thankfully knocked off first. It was like they were reading my mind. Jeremy Sisto and Desmond Harrington were pretty likable and did a good job overall. The acting in this movie was pretty good, especially considering it was a horror movie.\n\nThe movie borrowed a little bit from a lot of different movies, most notably Deliverance, which one of the characters even mentions by name, but in todays day and age, when we have seen it all, it was a pretty good effort. 8/10"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Alien Abduction&quot; is an example of a so-called &apos;found footage&apos; movie. In other words, much, if not all the film is supposedly real and was filmed by victims of some sort of supernatural event. The best example was the hugely successful film The Blair Witch Project—a film that cost practically nothing to make and which earned many, many millions of dollars. It&apos;s odd, but I have seen very few such films, though I thought the Norwegian film &quot;Trollhunter&quot; was absolutely brilliant and is a real must-see. \n\nWhen I looked through some of the reviews for this film on IMDb, I noticed that they were a mixed bag. Some really liked it but several didn&apos;t and complained that the genre is over-saturated and other films like &quot;Alien Abduction&quot; have already been made. I would agree with this sentiment, as although found footage films can be wonderful, after you&apos;ve seen a couple, the well starts to run dry. Because of this, no matter how good Alien Abduction is, for many it&apos;s an example of too many and too late to care. If, however, you&apos;ve not been exposed to these sorts of movies, then &quot;Alien Abduction&quot; is certainly worth your time. \n\nThe film is set around Brown Mountain in North Carolina—a place where many actual reports of glowing lights have been reported by many. Because of this Alien Abduction has an advantage because weird sightings have been reported in this area for years. Interestingly, I actually lived a couple hours from there and NEVER heard about such stories while I lived in North Carolinabut when I checked online, there were many, many reports. I am VERY dubious about all this, but apparently many people do believe aliens might be involved.\n\nThe story concerns a family that is going camping around Brown Mountain. They seem very ordinary in most ways—and this was a positive thing. Because they seemed just like other families in most ways, it made the supposed found footage more believable. The only oddity is that the youngest child supposedly was autistic and loved to film EVERYTHING—and that is supposedly how we got all this footage.\n\nWhile the family has seen some weird lights, the enormity of the problem doesn&apos;t sink in until they happen upon about a dozen cars all abandoned— with doors open and belongings scattered everywhere. While searching through these vehicles, the men in the family are set upon by aliens; you know--the Roswell types you so often have seen in films. But, being a found footage film, you only catch tiny glimpses and it&apos;s all very hard to make out. What isn&apos;t hard to make out is that Dad disappears— taken by these creatures. Soon, the rest of the family is running for their lives and the aliens seem content at picking them off one at a time.\n\nSo is the film any good? Yes. I think it was constructed very well. I loved the music—it was probably the best thing about the film and really helped build the tension. Additionally, the acting was believable and I liked the footage seen at the very end of the video camera being tossed out of the spaceship (which, by the way, was also used at the beginning). All in all, a tense and exciting film in a glutted genre. \n\nBy the way, if you do watch, don&apos;t turn off the credits as you&apos;ll get to see what appear to be interviews with folks who have seen these strange lights at Brown Mountain—though, interestingly, none of these people have claimed to have seen aliens.",

But where Godard&apos;s characters have a playful sense of humor, trying to act their gangster fantasies wearing fedoras and poorly executing non-thought out crimes to the tune of a swinging soundtrack and beautiful woman, Love Is Colder than Death does all with a fridgid, robotic sense of cool. Every shot is like a black and white photo where the acting is like posing in front of mirror before the action (or one of the characters)gets executed. The film is pretty avante-garde in using mostly completely static shots and the characters pretty much act &quot;too cool&quot;. They just stare at you as you&apos;re supposed to react, then when there&apos;s an action, you get surprised and realise it&apos;s still in the movie. Forget that the plot is simple, threadbare even, this is an atmosphere piece.",

      "reviewBody": "First-time director Todd Field&apos;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; is a dark and disturbing film which is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Recent high school graduate Nick Stahl is having a little bit of fun during his last summer of freedom. He is seeing Marisa Tomei (Oscar-nominated), a woman twice his age who has young children and is separated from her shady husband (William Mapother in an appropriately chilly performance). Mother and music teacher Sissy Spacek (Oscar-nominated) worries about the relationship while father and town doctor Tom Wilkinson (also Oscar-nominated) shrugs off the partnership as a simple summer fling. When tragedy strikes, the simple life in Camden, Maine turns into chaos for all involved. &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; is one of the roughest films I have ever watched. It is a movie that is thought-provoking in the fact that everything seems so normal and yet darkness looms overhead for the primary characters in the film. The fact that the film takes place in rural Maine just makes it that much more scary. When one thinks of situations from the movie occurring, few think of a place like Maine. Much like &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; shows that bad elements are everywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. However, be warned that &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; does not go for the black humor that &quot;Fargo&quot; went for. This is a film that will chill you to the bone. It is a must-see and easily one of the top five or ten films of 2001. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Sadomania is the infamous Women in Prison flick by the king of ultra low budget exploitation films, Jesus Franco, Spain. He has made many immortal films like Love Letter of the Portuguese Nun (nunsploitation, 1977) and Bloody Moon (ultra-gore, 1981), and even though some of his films are worse and not-so-ambitious, he definitely has a talent and is noteworthy film maker. His greatest masterpiece of the films I&apos;ve managed to see is Awful Dr. Orlof (1962), the black and white horror classic with Howard Vernon. Sadomania is among his dirtiest films and not without a reason.\n\nThe ridiculous plot has a newly wed young couple, who is kidnapped during their journey as they drive their wedding car somewhere in Spain. They are taken to the nearby women prison, led by sadistic lesbian warden (the late Ajita Wilson) and some sleazy governor and his wife, and despite the fact that the prison girls/women work hard there, their real reason to be there is to satisfy these leaders&apos; bottomless sexual desires and perversions. Poor women are raped and abused, in the guaranteed Franco style, but it all ends happily for the protagonists and evil and horny sadists meet their fate, again Franco style.\n\nThis film is okay if one happens to like these kind of &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; with huge amount of nudity and love making. The sleaze-o-meter is taken as high as possibly when considered the fact that the head warden Wilson was originally born man, but changed his sex to female, and the close ups of this attractive black lady show that her hands and some parts of the body are definitely male and thus her attractiveness tones down a bit (for hetero sexual man), but still, she is very sensual here, albeit her role character is more than repulsive. The other actors are more or less amateurs, but also talented ones. Beautiful females get naked a lot, and that&apos;s the thing Franco has always been able to do. Perhaps every frame of the film &quot;once it gets going&quot; involves at least one naked human being, usually female.\n\nThe &quot;message&quot; of this film seems to be that of what hides under our &quot;civilized&quot; surface and what kind of animals we are deep inside. Franco uses plenty of segments without a dialogue and some symbolic scenes (like the knife-fight-to-the-death scene), which show and depict the wild beast psyche what hides inside every human being, but in many cases un-active. Another thing is, that the sadists in the film are totally insatiable and hungry for sex, which is perhaps the strongest instinct in human nature and psyche. Sadomania shows us the faces of human nature we wouldn&apos;t necessarily want to face, but as we think about the state of the world and what kind of things take place, Franco&apos;s thoughts are more than true and serious. The fact that this film is mostly exploitation oriented doesn&apos;t mean that the film couldn&apos;t have any artistic merits, and Franco definitely wants most of his films to be more than mere exploitation.\n\nSadomania is noteworthy piece of Franco cinema, and shot with his usual zooms and beautiful images of nature, stained only by the presence of the film&apos;s ugly and evil protagonists. Sadomania has also some interesting elements in its soundtrack, which is supposedly composed by the director himself. I give Sadomania 7/10 rating, but that&apos;s only possible if one can watch these films and appreciate them despite their many filthy scenes and characters.",

      "name": "Franco Does Poe... And Giallo?",
      "reviewBody": "With a repertoire of almost 190 films, Jess Franco is probably the most prolific Exploitation director of all-time. I&apos;ve personally been a great fan of the Spanish Exploitation deity for years, and it has to be said that his films differ in quality immensely. While Franco was doubtlessly responsible for a vast amount of stinkers, his filmography also includes several downright brilliant films, such as &quot;Miss Muerte&quot;, &quot;The Awful Dr. Orloff&quot;, &quot;Venus In Furs&quot; or &quot;The Nights Of Dracula&quot;. And what could be a bigger treat for a cult-cinema fan than a Franco flick inspired by none other than the great Edgar Allan Poe? While &quot;La Noche De Los Asesinos&quot; (aka. &quot;Night Of The Skull&quot;/&quot;Night Of The Assassins&quot;/&quot;Suspiri&quot;, 1976) is not one of the absolute greatest films in Franco&apos;s repertoire, it is definitely one of his better ones, and a must-see for his fans. &quot;Night Of The Skull&quot; is a creepy and competent Gothic chiller that begins delightfully cheesy and turns out to much more convoluted and intelligent than one might think. A family has gathered in a Louisiana Castle to accept the inheritance of the British Lord Archibald Marian, who has been murdered in a horrible manner. While the family members are anxiously waiting for their inheritance, the killer, who has a weakness for bizarre murder methods, is still on the loose...\n\nFranco accomplishes to create a creepy Gothic atmosphere, and he also borrows a lot from the Italian Giallo. This is not the only Franco film that bears many resemblances to 70s Gialli (his ultra-nasty 1981 slasher &quot;Bloody Moon&quot; also has many Giallo aspects), but the inspiration has never been as obvious as in this one. &quot;Night Of The Skull&quot; is also probably Franco&apos;s least sleaziest film. Uncommonly for Franco, the film features hardly any nudity (only Evelyne Scott shows some skin) and very little sleaze. Even Franco&apos;s future wife, Lina Romay, who is known for being naked for about 90 per cent of her film career, keeps her clothes on in this one. Apart from young Miss Romay, the film features a bunch of other Franco regulars, such as Alberto Dalbés, the creepy-looking Luis Barboo and Antonio Mayans, as well as the great William Berger. There have been greater Poe adaptations than this one, of course. Poe&apos;s work has been most brilliantly brought to screen by Roger Corman with his magnificent Poe-films starring Vincent Price, some of which (&quot;Pit And The Pendulum&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, &quot;The Masque Of The Red Death&quot;) rank among the greatest Horror films ever made. Sergio Martino tied in with the tradition of brilliant Poe-Inspired films with his Giallo masterpiece &quot;Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key&quot; (1974). In case you want to see a true masterpiece inspired by Poe&apos;s writing, check out Martino&apos;s film or any of Corman&apos;s 7 films before this one. Overall, however, &quot;Night Of The Skull&quot; is a more than worthwhile film that features creepiness and delightful cheese in equal measures and provides several compelling twists that cult-cinema fans should enjoy. Highly recommended, especially to Jess Franco fans!",

Cage plays a rich, ruthless business man who is shown the life he might have led (by guardian angel Don Cheadle )if he&apos;d made a different choice. In A Wonderful Life kind of way he wakes up in suburbia with a mini van, bad suits and a couple of kids, but he also has true love with ex-girlfriend (Tea Leoni).\n\nI love the relationship here between Jack and his daughter -its so sweet, she sees through him and thinks he&apos;s an alien that&apos;s replaced her father.\n\nCage is, Cage but this was made back before he stopped caring so he has some great moments. Leoni makes me smile in every one of her scenes, she&apos;s so genuine and happy and goofy amidst the chaos of their life. One of those warm-fuzzy movies.",

I had some problem with the third victim in that the discrepancies between that and meticulously worked out modus operandi of the killer from earlier atrocities seemed glaring, never mind where he was likely to be on this night of the full moon. But never mind, the film is scary, very worrying and stunningly designed and shot with a decent central performance from William Petersen. He seems laid back and almost carefree but this is inevitable alongside the frightening performances of his past and present nemesis. The former is holed up in a terrifyingly all white cell and the latter lurking largely and taunting freely. Even though I had reservations about the final scenes these are very well executed and though I remembered little from my video viewing many years ago, that hand running through the tiger&apos;s fur was clearly burned into my subconscious. Great!"

      "reviewBody": "From what little I&apos;ve heard about &quot;Suicide Song&quot;, I was expecting an uninspired horror film on the lower end of the Japanese spectrum – ala &quot;Shikoku&quot; (1999) or &quot;Death Water&quot; (2006). Fortunately, it&apos;s far better than those films and actually carves out a little niche for itself in terms of originality.\n\nThe prominent misconception about &quot;Suicide Song&quot; is that it&apos;s a straight-up horror movie. Well, when schoolgirls evaluate the power of ghosts by FIFA ranking and an epitaph spells &quot;ugRy&quot;, you can be confident that you&apos;re watching a comedy. Such is the case here, as the primary intent of this film is to make you smile, not to scare you. The humor is very dry at times, but it&apos;s still rather obvious that this is a comedy first and foremost.\n\nI&apos;ve never understood why some viewers find it necessary first classify a film safely within a particular genre before sitting down to actually watch it. Perhaps these viewers are unfamiliar with genre-bending cinema to the point where they simply must judge films by a set of qualities that reside in a tiny conceptual box. If a film is supposed to be &quot;horror&quot;, then the basic requirement is to instill fear. If a film is supposed to be a &quot;comedy&quot;, then the basic requirement is to provoke laughter. A viewer who takes this point-of-view will surely be perplexed when they &quot;gear up&quot; for a horror flick and end up with a non-stop assault of dry humor instead. I personally thought the comedy worked, so maybe it&apos;s best for mainstream viewers to go into this film expecting a slower-paced comedy with a distinct Japanese style.\n\nSo, what&apos;s the story about? A number of schoolgirls commit suicide and may have been inspired by a pop song. Yes, the premise is very similar to &quot;Suicide Circle&quot;, but this title has almost no blood, choosing instead to pile on quaint satire in truckloads with a pinch of light horror and even some melodrama near the end. Somehow, it works. Even at 125 minutes, it chugs along rather quickly and is actually satisfying when all is said and done. The actresses are charming and well-acted too.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is a very cute, family friendly comedy/horror movie with some memorable, chuckly-worthy moments.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know why several people have criticised this film so severely. It does not have the fast pace of a nail-biting thriller, but then it is not meant to be one. Despite the fact that the setting and activities of the characters are concerned with espionage in postwar Berlin, this is not an espionage story but a tragic love story about people whose lives are ruined by what they do and have done. The screenplay is by Ian McEwan, based upon his own novel. These days he is best known for writing the novel ATONEMENT, filmed in 2007. The director was John Schlesinger, near the end of his career, for he would only make four more films (of his total of 28) after this. Sometimes Schlesinger could go really wrong, as in THE DAY OF THE LOCUST (1975), which I found unwatchable. But many of his films are classics, and he was an immensely gifted director. It was obvious as long ago as 1962 that Schlesinger was going to be a major director, and he did become one of Britain&apos;s finest. Campbell Scott is perfectly cast as Leonard, a shy young Englishman who lives with his mother, has never had a girlfriend, and works for the G.P.O. For those too young to remember, the GPO (General Post Office) had the monopoly in the past of all postal deliveries and telephone services in Britain. In the sixties you had to wait between six weeks and three months for the GPO to connect a new telephone if you moved house. They were so notoriously lazy, complacent, and incompetent, that everyone was thrilled when competition was introduced to telephony and British Telecom and Mercury emerged as commercial rivals. But that is enough about the history of telephony in Britain. The mail is today divided into Royal Mail (which is about to be privatised) and Parcel Force (which delivers, or in many cases fails to deliver, parcels.) But that is enough also about postal services in Britain. Scott is one of the few really bright people at the GPO, and he is indeed so clever that he is sent off to Berlin and seconded to the Yanks on a top secret surveillance project called &apos;Gold&apos;. This is based upon real events. The Americans really did dig a tunnel 100 yards into the Soviet zone of Berlin and tap the East German and Soviet phone lines during the Cold War. Scott plays the bright boy who actually does the tapping. The story is rather unconvincing here, for surely the Americans had their own such people, and also, surely a young nerd from the GPO was not the best that the Brits could supply? Well, never mind, it is a novel and a film, not a history book (though some history books are even &apos;less true; than novels, aren&apos;t they? I leave aside the question as to whether truth is absolute and so there is no such thing as being &apos;less true&apos;.) Now the film goes astray at this point, because the man in charge of the American operation is a spook played by Anthony Hopkins. I believe he gives a magnificent and subtle performance, but his American accent is simply not good enough, and that has justly irritated many people. Hopkins is also an acquired taste in general. But the history of this production may explain Hopkins being cast in this lead role, for he had at least some attraction to investors, though whether he was &apos;fully bankable&apos; in 1993 I cannot say. This film was produced by a very charming woman named Norma Hayman. But three weeks before shooting, her distributors pulled the rug out from under her. I don&apos;t know how she saved the film, but in the process it was entirely recast. I had a very uncomfortable experience about twenty years ago when I was with a close friend who was an executive producer who raised money for films. He got a call from Norma Hayman asking whether she could come to his home and see him urgently. He did not like being disturbed at home, and was very grumpy about it, and he also smelled a whiff of desperation in the air, which destroys confidence. So she arrived and they closeted themselves in a room for ages, but when they emerged, my friend was treating her very badly, indeed with contempt, which greatly shocked me, as I had never seen him behave like that. She was crestfallen. I needed to go and so she and I shared a cab into the centre of town (London). It was a sad and gloomy experience, she talked little, and I thought it best to leave her to her unhappy thoughts rather than to irritate her with chatting. As this film was made about that time, I wonder if this was the film she was trying to save on that day. Well, in the story Scott falls in love with the irresistibly alluring Isabella Rossellini, who plays a mysterious German woman, and she introduces him to the carnal side of life. But he then discovers she is married to a drunken brute named Otto, who beats her up and is refusing to sign her divorce papers. And lots of things begin to go seriously wrong. Scott wants to marry Rossellini, and who wouldn&apos;t, but then a terrible, bloody event takes place, just the sort of perverse thing that Ian McEwan seems to like inflicting on his readers and viewers, though Schlesinger resists any temptation to &apos;do a Tarantino&apos; with that material, and is as discreet as it is possible to be about something so awful. I think if the story were a bit less extreme in that particular, people would have liked the film more. However, the film is otherwise very good in my opinion, very sad and moving. It has an intriguing, very emotional ending which I am not permitted by IMDb reviewing rules to reveal.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a little bit different from Gilbert&apos;s other silent films. Usually Gilbert was cast in films in which there was a tremendous amount of action and/or romance. This time, much of the film is just Gilbert in a somewhat psychological battle against two thieves and the elements.\n\nGilbert plays Hugh Rand, manager of a South African diamond mine. He gets news that two visitors are due - Lord Stonehill and his daughter Diana. They arrive ahead of schedule, and against Rand&apos;s own predictions Lady Diana turns out to be a beautiful woman. However, it soon turns out that the two are imposters, but are found out by Rand before he can notify anyone else. The pair of thieves take off into the desert with their stolen diamond and their company of co-conspirators with Rand as hostage.\n\nThings begin to go wrong for the thieves, and pretty soon it is just Rand and the two imposters on foot, in search of water before the sun of the desert does them in. Throughout their journey Rand is laughing off the situation as well as laughing at the two thieves, now suddenly penitent and afraid of death. Rand has a right to laugh - he has control of the last canteen of water.\n\nGilbert often reminds me - in this and his other silent films - of Errol Flynn, showing temper and passion when it is called for, but usually laughing in the face of danger, having a genuinely good time in whatever situation he is put, and inviting us to join in the adventure with him. I&apos;ve often wondered what would have become of his career had he been ten years younger and started out in talking pictures instead of silent film. Would he have been MGM&apos;s answer to Flynn in the age of the swashbuckling picture? This film is highly recommended for the silent film enthusiast.",

Where was the director, did he fall asleep? The whole story hinges on an underwater discovery of a sunken British ship. What ship? Who was on it? Who drowned? The last time we saw the rings they were in the hands of the two characters in 1778 in a forest in India. How did the rings get on a ship? Not by the dead character in the forest! The last quarter of the film simply sinks the movie.",

This movie brings that mature stateliness of the old world before our eyes in almost an indelible way.\n\nMoving in a very slow and artfully calculated rhythm, one scene slides into another, each setting a perfect little painting that can almost distract the attention away from the action and the dialog.  The story develops gradually, starting out as a situation that is completely unfamiliar to the viewer and progressing stepwise through increasingly familiar emotional territory until even the 21st century American knows exactly where things stand.\n\nThe story is absorbing and the comment on Chinese society is important in today&apos;s world, but the main interest for me is the mood of meditative quietude and the rather dreamlike atmosphere that is generated continually, until it saturates right through."

Other than considering this film to be a fairly entertaining rehash of the first, I guess that&apos;s my review.\n\nAlthough I must mention that if someone were to fire a Desert Eagle handgun as close to their face as Andrew Divoff does in the final act of this film, he would probably burn his cheek and deafen himself... but I guess that&apos;s just part of Walter Hill&apos;s bombastic direction.",

The story in the movie is compelling and captivating, even though it drags out in a slow pace at times throughout the movie (making the 2 hours seem longer than they are). But in general, the movie works pretty well at a good pace.\n\nThere were some pretty nice images throughout the movie, I especially liked the gloomy doomsday-like images of the normally busy and crowded Japanese cities devoid of life and shown in a bleak gray-scale.\n\nMost of the medical scenes seemed real (or believable enough), although there were a handful of scenes that had some flaws in it. Scenes that will make you go &quot;hmmm, I wonder what kind of doctor/nurse would do that with their medical background&quot;. Which is a shame, because the medical stuff is what should carry most of the weight of the movie. But these flaws don&apos;t really bring the overall movie enjoyment down that much.\n\nFor some reason, the actors/actresses having to cry in this movie were all so amazingly poor at portraying hurtful emotion and crying. It all came off so forced and fake. That was almost literally physically painful to watch. Oh, and you just got to love the &quot;Engrish&quot; that is used in the movie. Japanese people speaking English is usually funny, and in this movie, it is!\n\nThe cast, in general, were fairly good. No award-winning acting going on though, but most did a fairly good job none the less.\n\nI would say that &quot;Pandemic&quot; is a mix of high rolling thrills and dragged out waiting. This is the type of movie that you watch one, and most likely never again. The movie does, however, leave you imprinted with lingering thoughts. Is a pandemic of this kind and magnitude lurking just around the corner? This effect is what brought the movie together in full circle.",

Fast Eddie Felson is perhaps the most talented pool shooter in the country and yet, at his core, he&apos;s a born loser. Why is Eddie so self-destructive? He has Minnesota Fats, ostensibly the country&apos;s greatest player, beaten in the first marathon match only to drink himself into insensibility and let Fats off the hook. \n\nThroughout the movie Eddie is surrounded by other people who are self-destructive or only interested in making a buck off of him. Even Charlie, his original manager (Myron McCormick in a terrific role)needs him for a meal ticket. Bert, his second manager, is a slithering, calculating parasite who uses everyone around him. Sara, Eddie&apos;s pathetic girlfriend, is going through life in an aimless, alcoholic haze. \n\nThe movie really lets you into the lives of these people who live on the margins of society. The cinematography is outstanding, the settings and mood of the movie draw you in totally. The acting is uniformly outstanding from top to bottom. Great movies get great performances from the minor characters, too. Vincent Gardenia, Michael Constantine, Murray Hamilton and McCormick are perfect in the smaller roles while Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie (all getting well-deserved Oscar nominations) and George C. Scott are indelible in the major roles. Even boxer Jake LaMotta has a cameo as a bartender. \n\nCan Eddie finally overcome being a born loser? Can love redeem any of these lost people? What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?"

He has those classic &quot;I&apos;ve got a monkey on my back&quot; mannerisms which the audience can appreciate, while the wife and father wonder why he seems nervous all the time. His dealer, a character known as Mother, played by Henry Silva, and Mother&apos;s sidekick, a beatnik type known as Chuch, played by Gerald S. O Laughlin, are memorable characters. Murray is great as his desperation grows, in debt to Mother, trying to keep his problem a secret, pushed to the extreme. The powerhouse drama features an utterly fantastic role, played by Anthony Franciosa, as Murray&apos;s heavy drinking brother, who protects Murray but is in love with his wife at the same time. It could have all been too stagey, but thanks to director Fred Zinneman, there&apos;s action to spare in this gritty New York drama.",

      "reviewBody": "The popular TV series Sex and the City has ran from 1998 - 2004, spawned a movie adaptation of the series in 2008, and here&apos;s the sequel that will most likely bring it to a close in 2010. At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We&apos;re so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.\n\nTo begin with, the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel, but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time, though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist, stereotypical jokes about homosexuals, Jewish people, and Middle Eastern people as well. I&apos;m sure if Prince of Persia didn&apos;t steal the subtitle, The Sands of Time, it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.\n\nThe plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie (Parker) wants more &quot;sparkle&quot; with her man &quot;Big&quot;, Charlotte (Davis) has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny (Eve) is getting too close to her husband, Miranda (Nixon) is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be, and Samantha (Cattrall) is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed, Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical, and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.\n\nIts sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap, but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this, it&apos;s better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long, but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun, intelligent talks. In this sequel, an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment, no talk is perfect in this film.\n\nOverall, the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should&apos;ve been extraordinary and have been on many critics &quot;Best of the year&quot; list. Instead it makes the &quot;Worst of the year&quot; list and probably will earn the title &quot;The worst film of the year&quot; by most critics. Wouldn&apos;t surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.\n\nStarring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Alice Eve, Chris Noth, John Corbett, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lewis, Lynn Cohen, and Liza Minnelli.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1964 the winds of change are sweeping through Sister Aloysius&apos; (Meryl Streep) St. Nicholas school. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic priest, is advocating reform of the school&apos;s strict customs, and the first black student has just been accepted. When a fellow nun (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may be paying too much personal attention to the student, Sister Aloysius begins a personal crusade against the priest -- despite her lack of evidence.  A Catholic grade school could seem like a hermetically sealed world in 1964. That&apos;s the case with St. Nicholas in the Bronx, ruled by the pathologically severe principal Sister Aloysius, who keeps the students and nuns under her thumb and is engaged in an undeclared war with the new parish priest. Their issues may seem to center around the reforms of Vatican II, then still under way, with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as the progressive, but for the nun I believe it&apos;s more of a power struggle. The pope&apos;s infallibility seems, in her case, to have descended to the parish level. Some will say the character of Sister Aloysius, played without a hint of humor .  Sister Aloysius of &quot;Doubt&quot; hates all inroads of the modern world, including ballpoint pens. This is accurate. We practiced our penmanship with fountain pens, carefully heading every page &quot;JMJ&quot; -- for Jesus, Mary and Joseph, of course. Under Aloysius&apos; command is the sweet young Sister James, whose experience in the world seems limited to what she sees out the convent window. Gradually during the autumn semester, the situation develops. There is one African-American student at St. Nicholas, Donald Miller, and Father Flynn encourages him in sports and appoints him as an altar boy. This is all proper. Then Sister James notes that the priest summons the boy to the rectory alone. She decides this is improper behavior, and informs Aloysius, whose eyes narrow like a beast of prey. Father Flynn&apos;s fate is sealed. But &quot;Doubt&quot; is not intended as a docudrama about possible sexual abuse. It is about the title word, doubt, in a world of certainty. For Aloysius, Flynn is certainly guilty. That the priest seems innocent, that Sister James comes to believe she was mistaken in her suspicions, means nothing. Flynn knows a breath of scandal would destroy his career. And that is the three-way standoff we watch unfolding with precision and tension. Something else happens. Donald&apos;s mother fears her son will be expelled from the school. He has been accused of drinking the altar wine. Worse, of being given it by Father Flynn. She appeals directly to Sister Aloysius. It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of &quot;Doubt&quot;.  Doubt. It is the subject of the sermon Father Flynn opens the film with. Doubt was coming into the church and the United States in 1964. After the assassination of Kennedy and the beginnings of Vietnam, doubt had undermined American certainty in general. What could you be sure of? What were the circumstances? The motives? The conflict between Aloysius and Flynn is the conflict between old and new, between status and change, between infallibility and uncertainty. And Shanley leaves us doubting. &quot;Doubt&quot; has exact and merciless writing, powerful performances and timeless relevance. It causes us to start thinking with the first shot, and we never stop. Think how rare that is in a film. I came to a different conclusion seeing this film. The entitled &quot;doubt&quot; was not about Father Flynn&apos;s guilt (which I believe becomes apparent toward the end of the film). The &quot;doubt&quot; is manifested in Sister Aloysius as she comes to doubt the institution of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to. Instead of getting rid of the priest, the church covers up the crime. I think that would be enough to cause anyone to have &quot;doubts&quot;. This was the last straw that caused this nun to have an emotional break down, reducing a once rigid woman certain in her beliefs to a sobbing and lost wreck of a human being. To answer the obvious mystery in the film - whether Father had some sinful (or criminal) relationship with a twelve year boy? The one word answer on the platter is &apos;Yes&apos;. I don&apos;t think the plot of this movie made a lot of sense for its 1964 setting. Would a nun in 1964 really suspect a priest of sexual abuse based on nothing more than a shirt being placed in a locker? In 2018, after two decades of priest abuse stories in the media, sure; however, in 1964, at a time when no one would dare criticize a man of the cloth, I have my doubts. Either way, I did enjoy the film and thought it was well-acted.",

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s a film, I&apos;ll always remember seeing that late Farrah for who died a day apart from Michael Jackson. Ironically they were good friends, and one thing that Farrah could do instead of Michael, and that was act. She scorches up the screen here, a raging queen of revenge on her attacker, who has come to attack her, for the second time, invading her home. She scarcely escapes the first attack, a car jacking, where they end up in a discreet parking spot. She manages to get away, leaving her car and wallet behind. With not much help from authorities (der, we&apos;ve seen it so many times before in rape films) it now becomes a game of waiting, with Farrah, quite on edge, and rightfully so. She does share house with two other women. Diana Scarwid, very good as a wild impulsive sort, and Alfre Woodard, as a more wiser black woman, the only one partially sympathetic to the rapist after the tables are turned, and turned they are. Farrah becomes caught in conflict with her mates who return to find Joe, the battered faced rapist chained up in the fireplace. She wants to kill Joe, on the too probable count, that if tried, and he gets off, he will come at her again. This is a real life situation scenario here, Woodard of course, dead set against the idea. For rape victims, this movie is not for you. It&apos;s an intense grueling flick about the rape process, where the consequences for a criminal&apos;s acts here are extreme (hence the title) for low class sort, Joe (a wonderful Russo) But it&apos;s Farrah who engrosses us, where Extremities is an engrossing and with a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere, where indeed it&apos;s well shot, where most of the movie is set in Farrah&apos;s pad. For some viewers it&apos;ll be tough to watch. Too, what&apos;s shocking is Russo&apos;s admittance, and his intentions, when untied and falling to the floor, where then Scarwid surprisingly becomes sympathetic. Although I really didn&apos;t like it&apos;s ending Extremities is powerful movie making and far from escapist fare for viewers, wanting to leave reality behind. I would also like to see the play one day, but for now, I&apos;ll stick to the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Although not quite on the same level as another coming of age Japanese teen musical Swing Girls (2004), Linda Linda Linda still has that kooky charm and punk rock vibe that makes it worthwhile checking it out.\n\nNothing major happens, no big love drama or major fall outs in this film or bullies trying to stop them, and that&apos;s refreshing to say the least. For me this probably has the beautiful Bae Doona;s best performance to date (I might slightly give the nod to A Girl At My Door but this film runs it close). She steals the film, as the kooky exchange Korean student turn front woman, to think she was 26 at the time of this film and a bit older then the other three female leads but she makes you believe she&apos;s a teenage girl. \n\n The other three members of the band are very good, especially Aki Maeda (Battle Royale) as the drummer. But none come close to topping Bae Doona. The ending has a bittersweet feel to it, as some else mentioned in their review that it&apos;s the last significant thing that they probably do. With shots of empty corridors and grounds of the school, it&apos;s kind of eerie in a strange way. Also big up the music of the Blue Hearts, you end up humming Linda, Linda for weeks after hearing it.\n\nI did have some problems with it. I did have some trouble with the pacing and I felt a few scenes could have been trimmed to make a tighter film. But overall it&apos;s nit picking as this film has it&apos;s heart in the right place, plus Bae Doona stealing the show. Well worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "Takumi is a high schooler who often delivers his fathers tofu late at night. His late night trips have made him adept at the winding down hill run of Mt. Akina, which is a course used by the street racers of the area as the ultimate test of skill. When an unintentional race brings him to the notice of the racers, his life changes as he has to field numerous offers to actually see who is the best driver.\n\nBased on a Japanese comic and cartoon, Initial D is a live action Chinese film thats broken box office records across Asia. Despite being a huge animation fan I&apos;ve never seen the animation nor have a I read the comic. I&apos;m not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing, but seeing how many fans of the source material are unhappy with the film I would say its a good thing.\n\nFlat out I liked this movie. It did take a while to warm up to, but once I began to take it for what it is I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIs it a great film? In someways yes and in others no. As I said this takes a bit to get going. The lead is a bit too closed mouth for my taste, barely uttering a word for the entire two hours. Its a bit too teen angsty. Still you have great characters and great performances by pretty much everyone in the cast (even if everyone was speaking three or four different languages when this was filmed.\n\nThe racing is excellent. Its mostly seems to have been done with out CGI enhancement. I like that there are no horrific crashes, police chases or other clichéd events that are so rampant in American movies. And while I was initially apprehensive by the fact the racing is always on the same stretch of road, I warmed to the idea since by doing that we really got to see who was best. (If you want American style racing in many different environments stay away) \n\nDefinitely worth a look see, especially if you want to see a race film that is not like all of the rest. 7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 out of 10 for IMDb purposes.",

      "reviewBody": "In the future money is not the most valuable commodity  nor stocks nor shares. Instead the currency of choice is time and the populace are able to trade hours, days and weeks off their lives in exchange for services and goods. Into this world is born baby Zachary  who grows into a little boy with a game plan and a scheme to make more time; whereas his sister swaps weeks for sweets etc as if it didn&apos;t matter. As adults, Zachary has continued this path, but so has his sister and he finds himself trying to challenge the rules to try and save her and his mother.\n\nThe film opens with a strange moment that becomes clearer a few seconds later when we realise that time is everything here. The film continues this thread by setting up the characters in a childhood section that, although not totally successful, is at least pretty interesting. The adult bit is immediately compelling on two levels thanks to the death  that it is so shocking but also that it is accepted by those around the deceased as a normal event (the waiter is particularly cruel). The final section of the film is less clear as it involves the smart woman and the &quot;old ones&quot;, neither of whom are really that explained  it also reveals a rather American aspect to the film in how it looks at people. The &quot;haves&quot; live long while the poor are forced to give up their time to them in exchange for life  from here on in it is best if we read (as we are meant to) time for money.\n\nBaring this in mind I didn&apos;t think much of the film&apos;s conclusion that everyone gets the same start in life and those who die young deserve it. This view is typically American, where anyone can be famous, rich or even President, however in the UK I think we know the structure better than that. In reality those born into homes with debt of time/money cannot ever get out, whereas those who are born into wealth etc will have a better chance  there are exceptions of course but this is mainly true. The film taking this line (we have only ourselves to blame) is rather clumsy and unpleasant and it takes away from the rest of the film. The cast are OK and features some good actors, including a cameo for Fred Ward.\n\nOverall this is a very interesting film that is bleak and looks good (on a budget) despite not coming together quite as well as it should have done. It is still worth seeing but the lack of development and explanation in the final section is a problem, especially when combined with a rather harsh viewpoint  not a socialist future then?"

Once again the story sees a bunch of high school students - who are in reality warlocks - attempting to introduce new members into their group. Inevitably some of the evil characters are murderous and go around bumping off peripheral characters until the good guys step up to do something about them.\n\nIt seems that the budget for THE BROTHERHOOD 2: YOUNG WARLOCKS was slightly improved over the first, as the production values are slightly stronger. Unfortunately, there are even MORE endless scenes of young muscle guys parading around in their underwear here, as well as a three-way sex scene between two guys and a girl (what else?) which seems to last a lifetime. The whole thing is poorly acted and silly, just an excuse for the director to appeal to gay men who also have a tolerance for Z-grade produce.",

      "reviewBody": "While my peers were racing to the movies to see such films as Pretty in Pink and Say Anything I couldn&apos;t wait to visit my grandparents&apos; farm in southeastern Colorado. In my grandmother&apos;s antique cabinet in their &apos;playroom&apos; were literally hundreds of tapes; movies staring the Three Stooges, the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello, and dozens of cliffhangers such as Mystery Squadron and The Adventures of Red Ryder . My love of serials is one of the few things I remember sharing with my father.\n\nSo when I was sitting in the theater and the first preview for Shy Captain and the World of Tomorrow came on I was transported back to the safety of my grandparents&apos; home and the love I felt while watching old cliffhangers with my dad.\n\nI was instantly in love with the movie, the beautiful quality of every frame that made the movie appear to be one beautifully illustrated comic book and, of course, the similarity to the campy sci-fi movies of the 1930&apos;s. I went home and immediately looked the movie up on the internet.\n\nI was stunned to find out that this was the first film Kerry Conran had directed or written, and that Sky Captain was originally a six minute reel that producer Jon Avnet saw and wanted to turn into a feature length film. The movie itself was first storyboard with crude animation so that the actors would understand what was happening in their scenes since the entire film was shot in front of blue screen. Because there were no actual locations filming only took 26 days instead of an estimated 6 months.\n\nWhen the movie opened on the 17th of September I was there for one the first showings. The theater was all but empty, only about twelve other people were there, all men, all in their thirties and all alone. I was truly shocked at the small turn out, what about this film had turned off so many movie goers?\n\nThe movie began and I felt like a little kid falling in love with movies for the first time all over again. The shuttle references to classic sci-fi movies of the 1920&apos;s, 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s littered the screen. References to King Kong, Forbidden Planet, and the comic book Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. were everywhere you looked. At one point Polly Perkins the feisty reporter played by Gwyneth Paltrow is talking to her editor on the phone saying, &apos;They&apos;re reached Sixth Ave Fifth Ave. they&apos;re a hundred yards away&apos;, a direct quote from Orson Welle&apos;s radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds. Even Star Wars was referenced when Joe &apos;Sky Captain&apos; Sullivan played by Jude Law is instructed to land on the air carrier&apos;s pad 327, the same number the Millennium Falcon lands on in Cloud City. By far the greatest reference to past greatness is the appearance Sir Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989, as the villain Dr. Totenkopf, using CGI and archival footage Conran brings back to life one of our greatest actors.\n\nI was in movie geek heaven, for about the first hour, and then my attention started to wonder. In a society of attention deficit the constant motion and flying from one scene to another and the quick, panicked, pace of this movie should have fit in, however I felt teased, as if I was only watching part of a movie, the part that would never have a conclusion. We receive through the dialogue what little character development the movie has to offer, which isn&apos;t much, and in the end no one grows, or changes, or even becomes deeper than a character in a commercial.\n\nLooking back at the old serials I realize that the characters remained the same generic, two dimensional characters they were at the beginning, but the lack of development goes unnoticed in an action film less than twenty minutes long. Today the only programs we watch that are less than twenty minutes are situational comedies that parade a host of cardboard characters through redundant stories lines. A two hour long episode is too much, perhaps Kerry Conran should have stuck more closely to the serial format and released the movie in smaller segments, maybe then I would have remained entertained and in love with his homage to old cinema. We are a country that seems to forever be moving forward with little room to go back and even though we sometimes get nostalgic for a simpler film, or movie hero, it&apos;s not always possible to pull off with today&apos;s intellectual needs."

There is a very big difference as in 1963 not only I was much younger but Cinema has changed. 55 Days was a Large Screen Movie compared with the Ten Commandments, Cleopatra of the same year 1963 and The Sound of Music and many others at that period. In those days of Cinema Hollywood convinced people to go to the Cinema with Movies that are not the same on Black and White TV on Small Screen. Watching it on DVD is not the same. Technirama an Advanced Technicolor, Dolby Stereo not as big as Cinerama. I specifically remember sitting in the cinema and the sound moved behind us. For example the Musical Bands in the opening scenes playing the anthems. About the History of China read the other comments. Still a very exciting Movie where a minority overcomes the Mass&apos;s winning at the end. David Niven does an interesting part that reminds me of the Guns of Navarone. Heston and most other actors do it very well too. Nine out of Ten in Sam&apos;s Scale.",

      "reviewBody": "This film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement ​​had to arrest Al Capone, Chicago&apos;s biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I&apos;m not mistaken, was &quot;Scarface&quot;), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (&quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone&apos;s arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people.",

      "reviewBody": "Sycophantic praise clearly went to the head of pornographer Michael Ninn, who after making some fine films in the &apos;90s later descended to pretentious crap like &quot;Sacred Sin&quot; and his recent Dorcel projects. \n\nThis effort did win several of those meaningless Adult industry awards, but is pure shite (as the Irish might say), despite the contribution of some mainstream heavyweights behind the camera. Rock star Eddie Van Halen served as executive producer and contributed with Loren Alexander to the musical score, while Ed French brought his well-honed horror expertise to the highly professional and arresting special makeup effects and gore. But Ninn and co-writer &quot;L.E. Smith&quot; fashioned a horrible screenplay that pretends we&apos;re not watching porn, but rather some ill-conceived philosophical Gothic Horror film.\n\nThe cast mainly delivers monotone, boring acting performances (of course, Adult actors can hump with skill once the sex begins) except for star Heather Vuur, who boasts of her acting training in the 72-minute BTS and delivers the tortured prose monologues with conviction.\n\nShe plays sort of a ghost/immortal who killed her husband Jean Val Jean when catching him humping their maid Jassie, and then committing suicide in a period-dress prologue. She makes the case for Lucifer/Satan, arguing for man&apos;s freedom while following the Fallen Angel, rather than staying on the straight and narrow of worshiping God as per organized religions.\n\nHer adversary is a miscast Nick Manning playing a police lieutenant who drives a flashy convertible sports car - he should have been assigned a Barracuda as Adult&apos;s answer to Touch Connors as TV&apos;s immortal &quot;Mannix&quot;.\n\nThe connection between them is as strained as the would-be philosophical ramblings of the script: Heather went on her killing spree four years after the death of her son, while Nick is still carrying a torch for his dead wife Brooke (a smashing beauty who steals the film in her scenes from star Heather). Feature is awkwardly structured around scenes of Nick getting drunk, with Heather giving him a hard time by having him relive sex with his dead bride Brooke, a flashy outdoor XXX scene in which she wears a beautiful wedding dress to add another fetish to the proceedings.\n\nSubplots are introduced in order to get the requisite porn content into a film that drags on and on in its non-sex scenes in a way that makes it quite dated for today&apos;s wall-to-wall fans. Silliest such tangent has the beautiful Dee kidnapped and then subjected by Heather&apos;s cult to forced sex with The Beast, a horned, muscular brute with terrific makeup effects played by the late Sledge Hammer. That scene could easily be anthologized and salvaged from this horrible mess of a feature, and probably will be someday.\n\nLots of work went into crafting this junker, clearly designed to impress the easily impressed (viz, gatekeepers who devise those bogus industry awards). Non-ending is extremely hard to swallow.\n\nWith Van Halen&apos;s name attached and a unique selling point (few if any mainstream greats would deign to use their real name in association with porn) I wasn&apos;t surprised that several scenes devolve into glorified music videos. The musical score, with its religious choral passages and hard rock moments, never achieves the lyrical beauty of those classic Adult scores by Saint (Christopher Saint Booth) that were so important in the success of dozens of Adam &amp; Eve romantic couples films released around the turn of this century.\n\nWorst scene shares with Ninn&apos;s later disaster &quot;The Four&quot; in being presented in Blurrovision, out-of-focus exterior &quot;romantic&quot; footage that turns into crisp focus when it comes time for the explicit sex portion to begin. I&apos;m way too old to suffer through such eye strain, whether in a mainstream, avant garde or Adult project."

      "name": "Trite, overplayed, lecturing nonsense which functions only as a guilty, mindless revenge picture.",
      "reviewBody": "Stallone and director Stephen T. Kay&apos;s re-imaging of the stunning, 1971 British gangster film Get Carter is a monumental mess on mostly all levels; a wavering, distorted and frankly quite annoying piece that renders what was once scuzzy pulp into polished actioner and slow burning film-noir into loud, messy, flashy nonsense. Some will claim it is Kay implementing his own style onto a set text, but in this case it is a set text that did not need re-imagining combined with a style we don&apos;t want to see, while the original did not need an update and certainly doesn&apos;t need to be fiddled with in order to act as a directorial calling card for someone who would later go onto have a career in making television shows.\n\nThe 2000 remake of Get Carter begins in its immediacy of establishing some sort of passing of the guard; this by way of briefly playing the old theme tune from the original film over the images before a newer, more contemporary beat kicks in continuing the same basic tone; in a sort of style that sounds like it was spat out of a rave club and landed smack bang on the soundtrack. It&apos;s a telling moment; a moment in which the recognition of the old was there, and that this newer version of both the music and film brings everything up to speed for the sake of it. Sylvester Stallone is Jack Carter this time around, a heavy working in Las Vegas more-so London who boards a train in order to travel to Seattle more-so Newcastle in order to attend his brother&apos;s funeral. One would hope the distorted, fragmented manner in which Jack&apos;s train journey is put across by way of the angles and editing is representative of the character&apos;s distorted and wavering emotions as he gradually gets closer to home with the realisation of a sibling&apos;s death gradually kicking in, rather than be included for the fact it might, in the maker&apos;s eye, &apos;look cool&apos;.\n\nCarter finds an unnatural manner in being able to waltz around kicking guys&apos; heads in; bullying his way into confrontations with people and evading injury during car chases with more sombre, more down to Earth scenes with Doreen (Leigh Cook), his niece and his brother&apos;s daughter. The scenes with Doreen enable Carter to act as some sort of would-be fatherly figure as he attempts to take her under his wing; delivering advice as if it were his brother&apos;s own, about life and what to do with it and how keeping on the straight and narrow is important – it&apos;s a life lecture from an action lead who, on other occasions when speaking to other characters, tells them: &quot;Sure it does&quot; when told that revenge doesn&apos;t work and it&apos;s implied that it ought to be something to be chased down.\n\nThe film sees Carter visit a whole bunch of misfits, from Alan Cumming&apos;s techno-boffin Jeremy Kinnear to Mickey Rourke&apos;s porn king-come-businessman Cyrus Paice, an individual who distributes a lot of pornography akin to Caine&apos;s version, only because it&apos;s now 2000 and it&apos;s the 21st Century we&apos;ve moved into here, everything is done by way of computers and disk drives instead of 8mm film stock. I say the 1971 film was &quot;Caine&apos;s version&quot;, but Michael Caine does actually have a role here, that of Cliff Brumby who you&apos;ll remember was tossed over the side of a multi storey car park in the old one by Caine himself. The joke around about the time of the release of this, I&apos;m sure, must&apos;ve been that Caine is playing the character he tossed away over the side in the original; while in playing a part in the ill-advised remake of Get Carter, thus has now tossed his own career over the side. Fortunatley, this didn&apos;t have the ill guided effect on his career it might&apos;ve done.\n\nSnide jokes aside, the problem that the remake of Get Carter is a dunderheaded, bits and pieces revenge action thriller starring someone whom seems to gradually get less and less interested as the film progresses is just half the issue. It&apos;s additionally just too all over the place to get involved in and too wavy in whether it wants to pay a lot of attention the the &apos;71 version or not. Whilst the film attempts to get some sort of dramatic flow to proceedings going, there&apos;ll be a scene straight out of the original that&apos;ll disrupt its course and make you go to yourself: &quot;Oh yeah, it&apos;s that part.&quot; or &quot;Oh look, this is how they&apos;re re-imagining this bit.&quot; which is so distracting and so annoying, completely destroying any sort of dramatic weight the film might have been carrying up to the respective point.\n\nRunning on colourful visuals and really lacking that distinct aura of menace the original certainly carried, 2000&apos;s Get Carter is rather a gross misfire. Its want to balance a morality tale with wanting to be faithful and unfaithful in equal measure to the original doesn&apos;t sit, while the meek level of substance by way of Stallone life-lectures twinned with the fact what it is that he does is on display just comes across as sanctimonious and stupid – if there was ever a point in which this remake really needed to borrow from the &apos;71 version, then it was with the ending and Carter&apos;s overall fate. If director Kay has translated anything, it&apos;s that he&apos;s translated a once unhinged, crime fuelled revenge tale into an unengaging and soppy series of grumbles, gunshots and girls that does absolutely nothing for its audience.",

I don&apos;t speak it myself, but this one of the few times I&apos;ve seen a French film and thought &quot;this (acting) seems really lousy - like a low budget exploitation film&quot;. \n\nI don&apos;t know if this film is available on DVD.

      "reviewBody": "If we think about movies that deal with the recent past of Vietnam, then everybody immediately thinks of war movies like for instance, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter... But why is that? I know how important this war was for the Americans as well as for the Vietnamese, but this is an old country with an ancient culture that has a lot more to offer than the battles, bombs and booby traps in the jungle, the rice fields or the cities. &quot;Indochine&quot; is a movie that tries to show us another part of the country&apos;s history. It deals with the latest years of French colonial times in Vietnam or Indochine as they called it back then.\n\nThe story starts in the 1930&apos;s at one of the largest rubber-tree plantations in Indochine (Vietnam). This plantation is owned by the French colonist Eliane, a proud woman who lives with her father and her native adoptive daughter Camille. She doesn&apos;t have a husband or a man in her life (apart from her father), but gets to know the young officer Jean-Baptiste when both want to buy the same painting at an auction. They have a short affair, but than she refuses to see him again. In the meantime it&apos;s Camille who has fallen in love with Jean-Baptiste and Eliane knows it. She makes sure he&apos;s send to one of the most desolate outposts on some remote island, making sure that the two will never see each other again. Camille has no choice, but to marry the man she was promised to, but in the meantime she starts a search to find the man she really loves.\n\nThis could have been a romantic movie in a different setting than we are used to, but nevertheless one like we have seen many more before. And in a way it is, but the movie has a lot more to offer as well. It shows the atrocities committed by the French, the great poverty of the indigenous people, the rise of Communism and the futile attempts to stop them (before the French got involved in the war that would later be continued by the Americans). This movie is a lesson in history and geography wrapped in a paper of romance and marvelous landscapes. It was beautiful and dramatic at the same time. I was touched and amazed by it and really liked it a lot. That&apos;s why I give this movie at least an 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Through a series of dove-tailing love vignettes, Max Ophüls offers us an enchanting film replete with some of the greatest acting talent French cinema has known.  The brevity of the individual segments of the film does not greatly impair the quality of the characterisation or acting performance, and there are some very impressive moments, particularly the scenes with Jean-Louis Barrault (best know for his role in Les Enfants du Paradis) and Simone Signoret (Les Diaboliques and Casque d&apos;Or).\n\nThe film is surprisingly - for a film of its age - pretty explicit about the sexual proclivities of the aristocracy and military men.  That a respectable middle-aged married woman should seek an amorous adventure with a man half her age, whilst her wealthy husband carries on with a young woman barely out of her teens most probably caused a few raised eyebrows when the film was released in 1950 - particularly when the film is very much in the velvet-lined mould of the traditional pre-war French romantic film.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the film, above the great acting and splendid direction, is its humour.  This is a film that is unable to take itself seriously.  The mysterious raconteur  (superbly played by Anton Walbrook) endeavours to keep the merry-go-round of love happily on its course, but has a few technical problems on the way.  It&apos;s reassuring to know that even all-knowing deities have their off-days.\n\nAnother strong point is Oscar Straus&apos;s musical score, particularly the raconteur&apos;s merry-go-round ballad which accompanies the film throughout, not unlike the cheery music of a real merry-go-round in a fairground.\n\nThis has all the ingredients of a great film.  It is a fanciful waltz across the ephemeral ballroom of love, and it succeeds admirably."

After gasping in dismay at The Golden Bowl, A Knight&apos;s Tale, and The Tailor from Panama in the theaters, I rented this movie at Blockbuster and it was an entertaining 2 hours. My God; a story told clearly and in a consistent way!!!!\n\nThe movie is stolen by actor Riley Smith, a teenage kid who has lost his father to urban violence and is forced to move away from the big city to a more rural area with his mother.  Smith is really believable and touching in the role; an actor who is leagues better than the majority of Hollywood teen heart throbs. He makes you feel his pain and his desire in this movie. One wonders why he is not in more mainstream pictures. He is surrounded by a good cast; a good script, and very straight forward direction.\n\nRecommended for a worthwhile rental.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;To be or not to be, that&apos;s the question.&quot;\n\nAnd that&apos;s the central question that encompasses many aspects of film-making. We gather that it&apos;s all about what is and what is not, what seems and what reality is, if it can be taken for granted... but that the iconic question was raised by the appearance of a spectrum speaks another truth about cinema: it&apos;s about death as much as it&apos;s about life.\n\nIt&apos;s about death in the sense that we&apos;re watching a present that is no more and the older a film gets, the fuller of ghosts the screen is. It&apos;s also about death because fiction isn&apos;t reality in the first place. We learn about life through a ghostly present called fiction, or a living death in motion, that&apos;s the first truth. And like life, &quot;The Idiot&quot; opens with a scream, a seminal scream tracing the invisible frontier between life and death. It&apos;s upon that screaming truth that &quot;The Idiot&quot; opens in an overcrowded train where passengers are sleeping.\n\nKameda (Masayuki Mori) shares with Akama (Toshiro Mifune) the nightmare he just had, a dream-like flashback of the execution from which he barely escaped. After that episode where he literally saw the ghost of death coming to seize him, he made a tacit pact with destiny: anything carrying life would be instantly precious, from the dog he threw stones at as a kid to any human being, everyone was worthy of his goodness. But because of the shell shock and the war-trauma, Kameda spent time in an asylum, and his dementia was translated into an uglier word: idiot, a verbal leitmotif with the same resonance as &apos;stupid&apos; in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.\n\nKurosawa adapted Dostoyevsky&apos;s famous novel changing its Imperial Russian setting to post-war Japan. He was perhaps one of his biggest fans, considering him the most truthful author when it came to paint humanity. And indeed, you can see another truth in Kameda&apos;s behavior: he&apos;s a good person, not candid or naïve, but good because he learned to fear death, it&apos;s the awareness of his mortality that forged his goodness. Goodness is at the core of being human, because what defines our condition is death and what should define it is being good. This good/dead duality turns Makeda into a zombie-figure, a ghost sleepwalking among humans.\n\nNormal people are too stubbornly attached to life to realize that they miss its very point. And it&apos;s only until they look at themselves through Kameda&apos;s eyes, played with quiet intensity by Mori that they&apos;re too disarmed to toy with feelings. I never really liked staring at people in the eyes because I found it like obscenely undressing them. And it&apos;s true that the titular idiot while not doing anything except reading, speaking or being present, allow these people to unmask their real selves. In a way, he is like a living metaphor of the camera, the threshold between the living and the seeming, a trigger to people&apos;s honesty.\n\nI mentioned Forrest Gump, but the idiot can be also compared to Peter Sellers in &quot;Being There&quot; where his candidness was mistaken for profundity. In the case of Kameda, there is a genuine perceptiveness in his eyes, capable to see beyond the barriers of reputation or social bearings, but that capability backfires at him because you just can&apos;t idealize everyone without hurting some. Kurosawa&apos;s movies have always been about people who could &apos;look&apos; but being a passive observer was only one step before action, there was no meaningless look. In &quot;The Idiot&quot;, looking is active by essence and meaningful by necessity, not just for the observer.\n\nIndeed, it all starts with Akama showing a picture of Taeko (Setsuko Hara) a woman he&apos;s literally buying from a &quot;benefactor&quot; who&apos;s literally auctioning her, Kayama played by the baby-faced Minoru Chiaki is also interested to buy her for a lesser dowry. When Kameda sees the picture of Taeko, it&apos;s not just love but truth at first sight, he can&apos;t see the whole thing, until a birthday party where he reveals with a sharp candor the amount of humanity he can read in Taeko, connecting it to the same fearful look he saw in a man who was executed. Taeko is so fascinated by the man she asks him if she should marry Kayama.\n\nLater in the film, the triangular love has evolved, the rivalry isn&apos;t between Akama and Makeda but between Taeko and Ayako (Yoshiko Kuga) the daughter of Kameda&apos;s host played by Takashi Shimura. The two women love the same man, a situation that is likely to have two collateral damages and speaks another truth about life: the intentions no matter how good they are carry inevitable bad effects and vice versa. And Makeda&apos;s ambiguous relationship with Akama (Mifune has rarely been as intense... and sexy) reminds of their previous confrontation in &quot;Rashomon&quot;, two men with two versions of the same story, each one living in his own fantasy or dream-like vision of life, each one driven mad because of truth.\n\nDreams or alternate realities are often present in Kurosawa&apos;s oeuvre, maybe to better preserve us from the painful truth as if goodness was too unbearable. The film is set in a cold wintery town, covered by snow, where people are too struck by coldness to act naturally, or during a carnival or a fancy reception where everyone plays a role and only one person stays the same, the man without a personality, a persona, a mask. He&apos;s the man who affect personalities, allowing them to transcend their condition, encouraging a woman with a reputation to emancipate herself, a crook to apologize and the weakly Mayaka to renounce money.\n\nEvery scene is staged with an opposition between passive liveliness and active inertia, reminding of that transcendent power of the camera, a frontier between life and death, dream and reality. The film speaks so many truths (a word I used a lot) maybe at the risk of being overlong, but it carries an irresistible poetry of its own.",

Movie was very well presented with a brilliant PR over the net and other news medias, but the movie was a total disaster. \n\nPart 1 didn&apos;t offer anything. But a promise of more and better action story was given for the film 2. \n\nAfter watching the second one the disappointment was complete. Acting wasn&apos;t good, storyline non-existent. Good filmed fighting scenes, but that&apos;s it.... \n\nThe movie didn&apos;t have anything to offer and watching is a total waste of time...",

The acting was pretty good, though, could have used some more emotion at times.\n\nThe feeling of intrigue and suspense will grip you from start to finish, all resulting in an unpredictable and surprising climax.\n\nGrade B+",

      "reviewBody": "Average horror movie regarding a paranormal investigator who is assessing a house for supernatural activity. Due to the title, you know what happens to her in the end. It is done as a documentary style film, so it almost resembles found footage. The movie is more spooky than scary.\n\nThe genre has been done to death and there are many better movies out there about ghost hunters. This one, however, isn&apos;t too bad and was a little better than I expected. Parts of it are really creepy.\n\nThere are some issues with bad acting here and there and at times the dialog seemed a little silly, but overall it was certainly watchable and generally held my interest. Most of the actors did okay with their roles with the exception of the father. I also had a hard time with the casting of the church girl - I didn&apos;t find her believable at all. She did okay with what she was given, but I wish they had cast someone who didn&apos;t look so hardened.\n\nBecause the writer wants you to believe this is a documentary (it isn&apos;t), night vision film is used sporadically - it shows as green and is common in these types of movies. If you have ever seen shows about paranormal investigations, you&apos;ll know what I&apos;m talking about. Part of the film also concerns the investigator&apos;s journal entries which might run some folk&apos;s nerves.\n\nThe movie runs at 1:45 so it is longer than most. As other reviewers have said, I think it could have been cut by at least 15 minutes and still told the story it wanted to tell. The back story of what actually happened in the house occurs towards the end of the movie so most of the loose ends are tied.\n\nFinally, this isn&apos;t a splatter or CGI film, so if that&apos;s your thing, you might want to skip it. Otherwise, its just okay - not great, but not bad.",

As always in stories like this, there are those who are suspicious and those who are on his side. The film is spare and naturalistic in setting and tone, and it packs one gut punch of an ending.\n\n&quot;The Organizer&quot; brought writers Age, Scarpelli, and Mario Monicelli (who also directed) an Oscar nomination for Best Original Story and Screenplay at the 1964 Academy Awards.\n\nGrade: A",

The songs and dancing routines are first class, a little &quot;Hermes Pan&quot; influence. I am also a fan of John Payne. His understated and often over looked skills as an actor are on display as be brings a light touch to this enjoyable romp. I thought Alice Faye was wonderful but would like to have seen her do a couple of more musical numbers like she has done in her other projects. No one can introduce a song during the era of the 30s and 40s like Alice. The colors are big, bright and beautiful and makes for a wonderful watch. I may be old fashioned but this is a film i could watch with the grand children and laugh out loud with them.",

Meryl Streep plays an Italian living in rural America and she is out of this world. Her opening scenes at the breakfast table are staggeringly beautiful, it could have been a silent movie, we would&apos;ve understood and live Francesca&apos;s story just by looking into Meryl&apos;s beautiful face. Every laugh, every move, every nuance is so Italian and so real that I went to look up her background to see if there was some Italian blood in her. Apparently not, but she reminded me of Anna Magnani and of my mother - she&apos;s Italian too, so I should know. Clint Eastwood&apos;s performance is tender, powerful and generous. I started going to the movies in the 70&apos;s and part of the fascination was to go and see movies with adults doing adult things, behaving and reacting to life the way adults do. &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; &quot;Coming Home&quot; &quot;Sophie&apos;s Choice&quot; and then the old great old ones from &quot;Sullivan&apos;s Travels&quot; to &quot;All About Eve&quot; As a side note I should inform the decision makers that on my second visit to the theater I took five kids with me, two 17 year old boys and three girls, 18, 16 and 16. They went back to see it a few days later with some of their contemporaries. The comment of one of the boys was: &quot;It made me think of things I don&apos;t usually think about&quot;. He invited his mom to the movies to see &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; According to his mother, that was the first time ever, but, as it happens, not the last.",

Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.\n\nThe effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed &apos;spousal abuse&apos; ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.\n\nThe success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.\n\nThe movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.\n\n(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can&apos;t resist hiding himself.)",

There are many great horror films out there but only a certain few really push the edge of what makes a out of the ordinary smashing hit horror movie. This movie does that, its a rare breed of great horror that has came out in the last decade. \n\nObviously movies cant cater to everyone&apos;s taste and especially in horror as everyone has limits on what is deemed acceptable more so then many other types. The only reason I guess I mention this is the low rating given at the time I viewed it was 5.8 which to me is a blunder beyond blunders. This movie, has all the aspects you want in a horror movie from, all of the aspects everything;scary,gripping,intense,relentless,etc. There really is no lull or give through out this movie, not one second, every second is like a fine wine of horror that&apos;s the only way to describe this movie. \n\nI could write a book on why this movie is great but ill just say that in thousands of horror movies out there, there are a few that stand out and once in awhile one gets it all right and this is one of those!",

It was terrible, as is the case more often with Dutch productions.

      "reviewBody": "According to &apos;wikipedia&apos;, VELD was billed as &quot;The First Soviet Horror Movie&quot; and maybe it was but &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; is a much better fit. The film combines a couple of Ray Bradbury short stories, foremost being &quot;The Veldt&quot; which first saw the light of day in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; back in 1950 and was source for a few portmanteau films over the years, most notably THE ILLUSTRATED MAN. The terrors of modern technology was its theme and the action takes place in a not-too-distant future where &quot;The Happylife Home&quot; takes care of all the family&apos;s needs. Children are raised in virtual reality nurseries and one young couple becomes alarmed when they hear the sound of roaring lions after their two kids, Peter and Wendy (in a nod to James M. Barrie), spend all their time in there imagining an African veldt. That&apos;s just the starting point in a film that, despite its muted colors and oppressive gloom, closely resembles the work of Italian horrormeister Mario Bava when it comes to spooky tableaux. Other subplots include an old couple who see their young son, dead forty years, outside in the moonlight one night and what appears to be a plague has broken out when hazmat-suited &quot;sanitation workers&quot; in tanks begin dragging bodies out of houses. The Russians also did filmic justice to Agatha Christie&apos;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; around the same time and they obviously had a knack for faithful adaptation. Pretty good.",

      "reviewBody": "F.T.W. Is an very good movie, this movie makes you think. If any book you&apos;ve rad yesterday makes you think about the context of it today, it means the writer have achieved his goal. He brought the idea in exact wright manner to move you, to make you think about it, to make your brain chew the theme, maybe even to change your views. Same goes for the movies. And this is an kind of a movie that makes difference, probably this is one of the best M.R. movies. I don&apos;t want my &quot;movie-hero&quot; to use a gun, or be cool. All this naive state of being cool is temporally, Pulp Fiction is not cool. Cool means stable state of emotions, or mental condition, to be able to have under control the negative reactions that may accure. If your &quot;movie-hero&quot; using F word and every two minutes reloads his gun, he is sick person and needs medical attention and that ain&apos;t cool. In this movie FTW lost his years in prison, after his release he decided to move on and leave the past behind. Emotionaly and mentally he require full recharge of his lost strength. You can witness him being cool, emotionally balanced person. He had all his reasons to use every second the &quot;cool&quot; F word or kill every cop in this movie trying to be die hard outlaw. But I guess it is much harder not to do that. \n\nI actually grew-up with the movies like Desperate hours, Barfly, F.T.W. Angel Heart, Johnny handsome etc I guess I saw all his movies, but I&apos;ve lost my respect for this actor after I&apos;ve forced my self to finish watching Exit in red, and then Point Blank. I had bad feeling that MR needed so badly money for a new operation, so he was willing to make any movie just to make another buck to get another face-lift done. Sorry MR I love your early work... \n\nBut please find out for your self and make your own judgment",

In this film, taking place in 1996, Naschy is a successful writer who is still suffering from the werewolf curse. Various murders are happening across town so will this curse ever die? This film is pretty legendary amongst Naschy buffs because the star wrote the screenplay but most of it was torn to shreds by the director who cut out all the violence, gore and nudity. With all that stuff missing, there&apos;s not a single thing here worth watching. All the detective talk is very boring and even Naschy appears to be sleepwalking through the film. The performances are all pretty bad and the English dubbing doesn&apos;t help them any. This film was never released in America and it&apos;s not hard to see why. Total pointless on all levels."

I&apos;ve known women who&apos;ve been cheated on, and it changed them from sweet and happy, to vindictive people who trust no one. I&apos;ve known families torn apart by drugs and alcohol, and the pain I see in Diary of A Mad Black Woman is dead on. Yep, I know older ladies who carry a pistol in their handbags. Maybe that&apos;s why I am so attached to this film. I know these people. DOAMBW is rough on the emotions. The pain is palpable, and we need Madea to break up the hard parts. It&apos;s like when you have sickness and death in the family, and you get punchy and silly. You have to laugh to keep from crying. The pretty people in this movie are really beautiful. Who could ever get tired of looking at Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore? When I hear the voice-over of Kimberly Elise reading the diary entries, it&apos;s so realistic. It&apos;s the exact things you think when you are falling for someone and trying not. I&apos;ve read a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but I just don&apos;t see the problems. It isn&apos;t a documentary after all.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a fan of the Zapatista sub-genre of Spaghetti Westerns, you will not want to miss this one. Chock full o&apos; all the good Italian Marxist/Zapatista staples, it is not preachy but highly contemplative, ultimately leaving the viewer to choose their stance. Nice pacing, it never drags. A very considered and well executed Zapatista SW.\n\nIf you&apos;re simply a fan of Spaghetti Westerns I think you&apos;d give it between 6-7, rather than the 8-9 that I&apos;m giving it since I really love that sub-genre. I can&apos;t see how a straight SW fan would be disappointed though.\n\nThe only audience that I think might be put off by it is the &quot;pat answers&quot;, &quot;everything tied up with a bow on it&quot; crowd. Throughout, it just refused to do that. That&apos;s tasty from where I sit, though.\n\nThis movie must be pretty rare. Few votes one way or the other on sites like this, and it is never mentioned in Austin Fischer&apos;s go-to reference on the genre, &quot;Radical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western&quot;. I have to think he&apos;s not familiar with it, because it makes many of his points better than the examples he gives. If you like studying that sort of thing, this one will let you get away from the feeling that the best examples of the sub-genre are pretty much written in stone. Here&apos;s one that has stayed below the radar waiting for your own personal discovery. I watched an original Italian wide screen version with English subtitles. I don&apos;t know where/how it has been released, but I really liked it that way as opposed to dubbed or whatever. Actually, I&apos;m remembering now that I did my own subtitles file for it, so I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s actually available. \n\nI don&apos;t think this counts as a spoiler, because you never are told this in the movie, but the bandito&apos;s name is quite tongue in cheek. He has a sort of Brillo pad kind of hair, and his name translates as &quot;Evil Hair&quot;, or &quot;Bad Hair&quot;.",

The amazing attention to detail by Rian Johnson (the writer/director) and the incredible performances by Haas, Zehetner, and especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt marks this very commendable film. I remember sitting in the theater before the film started, completely disappointed by the last two films I had seen the night before. I truly wasn&apos;t expecting to be wowed or even awake, but from the very first scene I had to keep &quot;my specs peeled&quot;. We just don&apos;t get to experience the feel of this movie anymore. I highly recommend it once it&apos;s out."

The special effects were quite good and the story is average, nothing too exciting or impressing about it. Jay Chou made a pretty good Kato with his serious and die hard attitude and his skillful martial arts moves. Seth Rogan made an awful Green Hornet - obnoxious, loud, annoying and unsympathetic. His gruff, raspy and incredibly irritating voice made me glad that Kato delivered him several good punches. Cameron Diaz looked like she was thrown in for good measure.\n\nWhen you end up rooting against the lead superhero, there&apos;s really not much enjoyment in this movie.\n\nGrade D-",

      "reviewBody": "This trigger-taut Western drama deals with a lawman and a badman , the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest stand-up gunfight in the history of the West . They are the strangest alliance between the West&apos;s most famous sheriff Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) , trying to overcome outlaws and its deadliest gambling killer , Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). It&apos;s incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action , Lancaster portrays the large-than-life lawman , living by the old rules , driven by revenge , dueling to the death and Douglas is most impressive as a gunslinger , the hellfire gambler , his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman&apos;s heart . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone.\n\nThe flick is formed by three parts and divided by three songs played by Frankie Lane and musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin . The first is located in Fort Griffin where Earp finds Holliday and helps him against Ed Bailey (Lee Van Cleef). The second part concerns on Holliday and his mate Kate (Jo Van Fleet) and appears a gambling-woman , the red-haired named Laura (Rhonda Fleming) . Here Doc helps Earp against another historic characters , such as Shangai Pierce (Ted De Corsia) and Johnny Ringo (John Ireland), furthermore is the sheriff Ben Masterson (Kenneth Tobey) . The third part focuses Tombstone , 1881 , with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan (DeForest Kelley) , Virgil (John Howard), Wyatt Earp , Doc against the nefarious Ike (Lyle Bettgler), Billy Clanton (Dennis Hooper) , Johnny Ringo, and Tom McLowery(Jack Elam). The main character is a historical figure , in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature , in this &quot;Gunfight at O.K. Corral&quot; (1957) by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in &quot;The Hour of the Gun&quot; (1967) ; the demystifying &quot;Doc&quot; (Frank Perry, 1971) with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach or the more modern &quot;Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; (George P. Cosmatos, 1993) with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer and ¨Wyatt Earp¨ (Lawrence Kasdan, 1994) with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid . The motion picture was stunningly directed by John Sturges\n\nThis is a story enormous in scope ,unusual in concept with a mile-a-minute action on a climatic and thrill-a-minute gunfight. Packs a magnificent cinematography-Vistavision and Technicolor with overblown chromatic by Charles B Lang and outdoors shot in Fort Griffith , Tucson, Phoenix and Tombstone . This thrilling film contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by the great Dimitri Tiomkin . John Sturges&apos;s masterpiece of the West in one of the top films of the 1957 year . Followed by a sequel ¨Hour of the gun (1967)¨ also directed by specialist Sturges with James Garner and Jason Robards .",

      "reviewBody": "Sometime in the 1990&apos;s I believe, the Earth has sent many ships to space and is awaiting the arrival of an alien to Earth after sending various stress signals.  A crew of three astronauts(including a young Dennis Hopper and Judi Meredith)go to their planet when some kind of problem arises.  It seems this race is dead or dying, and the scientists on Earth want to explore their culture and, unbeknownst to them, their anatomy.  Another expedition is needed to go after the first with two more astronauts led by John Saxon. In control at home is Doctor Farraday, played with enthusiasm by Basil Rathbone.  What the astronauts find on this dying planet(actually one of its moons) is a creature that is horrific yet strangely sexually hypnotic.  The creature is in definite female form wearing what has to be one heck of a tight body suit that shows every...and I mean every curve, peak, and valley. Florence Marley plays this vision of beautiful horror.  Her face is green and her hair rises up like some kind of testy beehive.  She says nothing but acts with her face and facial movements.  One side note about this alien presence.  It feeds on blood.  Well, you can guess what happens to sundry members of the crew as she/it vampirizes them.  The innovative part of the script is that most of the people in charge are more concerned with saving the &quot;beast&quot; for the acquisition of knowledge rather than the, in many cases their own, preservation of life. This is definitely something laced throughout the Alien movies.  Queen of Blood is a very innovative film that uses some insightful direction from Curtis Harrington with what looks like an obviously small budget.  Harrington used clips from a Russian scinece fiction film to show the rockets and other large scale sets.  But despite its small budget, Harrington manages to create a film that is haunting, eerie, and strangely beautiful, not to mention adding some good scares and some thought-provoking questions about science and its ends.  He uses colors most inventively...blue, red, green hues all over.  The acting is adequate. Its fun to see Mr. Rathbone, although he looks very tired and old.  Mr. Sci-Fi himself, Forry Ackerman, has a bit part and oddly enough the best scene in the film at the end...a real unexpected climax.  Be sure to give Queen of Blood a try...the first half or so is somewhat boring and slow, but it does pick up and I think is an excellent foray in the world of intelligent sci-fi."

      "name": "A characteristically incoherent and outrageous dark comedy from Russ Meyer",
      "reviewBody": "During the 1970&apos;s Russ Meyer established a reputation for producing low budget movies exploiting violence and nudity which were very successful as midnight features in conventional cinemas, or at drive in cinemas.  They established a recognisable genre which usually followed a similar template and made a Russ Meyer film very easy to recognise. Now that these films have reappeared on DVD&apos;s for home viewing, and are being featured on some TV channels, interest in them may be reviving. Their most characteristic feature is one or more very violent sequences in which characters who have received what should clearly be fatal wounds, pull themselves together and continue to cut themselves to pieces until even the director has been satisfied. Another almost universal feature is a cast that includes several very generously endowed young women who are not adverse to displaying their natural assets unwrapped. Other common features in Russ Meyer films are (1) great photography of a variety of exceptionally scenic locations (to my mind this is often the most attractive feature of his work), (2) a naked siren or spirit who watches over the proceedings, and periodically comments on them in a moralistic way, (3) a corrupt law enforcement officer with a voracious sexual appetite who eventually meets a &quot;just&quot; death, (4) a script which ultimately delivers violent death to all those characters that Meyer regards as completely antisocial (these include all homosexuals, anyone associated with the drug trade, and any Nazi supporters who have survived World War II), and (5) some sort of postscript that summarises the lessons which we are expected to have learned from the film that we have been viewing. &quot;Up&quot; was released in 1976 and is I believe the best, (or the worst - according to ones point of view), of the films of this genre he produced.\n\nSuch a film could not be easily imitated today, it dates from a time when the augmentation of mammaries was not usually practiced, so the fairly vigorous movements Russ required from his cast always led to very pronounced &quot;bouncing boobs&quot;. Today most of the starlets who compete to participate in movies that feature their bare breasts, have had silicone implants which lead to a very different physical response. Whilst most of Russ&apos;s films feature such starlets in the cast, &quot;Up!&quot; may be the first where Russ recognised that these unusually well developed mammaries are often associated with an unusually generous pubic thatch, and also made a great effort to pay his photographic respects to this characteristic. Clearly the primary focus in the selection of the cast for this film was not acting ability, and too much should not be expected in this area. Nevertheless Raven de la Croix has an extremely expressive face which, when compared with some other Russ Meyer films, minimises any deficiencies in this respect.\n\n This film also features all the other characteristics of his work listed above. The naked spirit who provides a periodic commentary is playfully portrayed by Kitten Natividad, who has a role listed as the Greek chorus and whose comments are frequently delightfully pretentious. Gory violence is perpetrated with an axe and a chainsaw, both of which appear to have been chosen by the characters concerned in preference to the firearm that they could also have used. This scene would be completely intolerable to view were it not filmed with such extreme hyperbole that it is reduced to the level of black comedy. &quot;Up!&quot; also features the ultimate in surviving Nazi supporters - Adolph Hitler himself, together with his daughter by Eva Braun, who in some way appear to have escaped from the bunker in Berlin and taken up residence in California. The story, such as it is, starts with the murder of Adolph and follows the search for his assassin. Continued flashbacks make it difficult to follow, but this film is comedy rather than drama, and anyone viewing it today will be watching it for the visual effects (including both the types of spectacular natural scenery so generously featured), rather than the story line.\n\nA good review should help its reader to decide whether they would regard the film as worth watching. With &quot;Up!&quot; this is simple, if you are a fan of Russ Meyer but do not know this film, you should certainly, in my opinion, accept any opportunity to see it because it is a more mature production than many of those which preceded it. If you have not seen any of his films but are anxious to sample one of them in order to assess why they have become cult favourites, I would recommend &quot;Up!&quot; because it is very characteristic of, but less extravagantly presented than, many of his earlier works. If you are one of those to whom Meyer&apos;s somewhat incoherent films will not appeal, the information above should be sufficient to save you from investing valuable time watching it."

The result was a wildly veering mish-mash of genres which the director failed to navigate successfully.\n\nOverall, the film felt like a mix between a 1940s melodrama and a 1970s made-for-TV two-part series, with a loathsome central character.\n\nTwo people in our group of 20 loved the film, so it must have something going for it. The rest of us were desperate for it to be over from about 20 minutes in. At one point, the main character gets sick, and from behind me and beside me I heard simultaneous mutters of &quot;please die&quot; and &quot;thank god&quot;. That was exactly how I felt.\n\nI am sure the film was making all kinds of comments about art, literature, characterization etc etc but it all went sailing over my head. Driving home, I said as much to my flatmate, and he paraphrased Bill Hicks to me: &quot;The film was bad. Don&apos;t get suckered into believing it actually saying something complex and clever. It was bad. Leave it at that and walk away&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "None of the reviewers at this site or elsewhere have noted that there are four, not three, filmed versions of this unique and haunting novel.The fourth appeared on American television between October,l957,and January,l958. It was probably a Hallmark production ,obviously has never replayed,and is not listed in this data base.\n\nThis is all the more disconcerting as it is the only dramatized version(The silent version is unobtainable and exists in only one known copy)which in any way remained faithful to the spirit and much of the text of the original.Wilder&apos;s book calls to be read aloud and the three leading actresses in this particular production did everything possible with the essential sound values.\n\nThe key role of the Marquesa was taken by Judith Anderson(of &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; fame) and she literally almost breached the saving boundary between make believe and reality.Unlike the recent version there is nothing funny about this woman.Her daughter certainly does not visit her in Latin America.Like King Lear ,she has been exiled from Spain at her daughter&apos;s request.And not without good reason.The Marquesa is a terrifying and vicious old drunk who is positively guaranteed to disrupt any social occasion which she attends. On the other hand,in exile,and smashing bottles in the audience&apos;s collective face,she,the most terrifying of mothers,writes epistles on her genuinely frustrated love which will go down in the history of Spanish literature.Finally she meets a teenager who is\n\nemotionally abused,and, as emotionally abusive, as the great lady herself;\n\nand so the pair scream and claw till they eventually reach a truly loving accord.It seems both women now,for the only time in their lives,will have something to live for.But that entails first crossing the Bridge of San Luis Rey.\n\nIf we have any present day American actress,aside from Julie Harris,who could have recreated this part it is Kathy Bates.She must have jumped at the chance to do it.Unfortunately the incredibly uncomprehending adaptation defeats her.As it does the wonderfully gifted Polish brothers.They are literally left speechless.\n\nSimilarly the fifties version ended with a great hymn to love from the Mother Superior(played by Eva LaGallienne) to the broken actress (Vivica Lindfors)who has lost(half-driven) mentor,lover, and child to the abyss.The new version gives us anti-Catholic propaganda with the woefully miscast DeNiro and Byrne struggling with materials they were not born to enunciate.\n\nOur catastrophe ridden neo-Babylonian society could use a good new production of &quot;The Bridge&quot; right now.Too bad that it didn&apos;t get it.If the fifties version still exists, may be this letter will be an incentive for someone to dig it from the archives. Lindfors,La Gallienne,Judith Anderson,you should be living at this hour.",

On the present days, Sheriff Reed (Robert Pine) is near the retirement and will be replaced by his son; while they are having a meal in a diner in a rest stop in the middle of the desert, a runaway car with three thieves of a casino stops in the spot for refueling. One of the robbers is the former boyfriend of the waitress Maya (Mircea Monroe) and another criminal is wounded in the backseat. There is a shootout among the thieves and the sheriffs and their car explodes. However, the body of the wounded criminal vanishes and the survivors discover that they are stranded in the place; further they are stalked and chased by a fiend with stench known as The Reeker.\n\n&quot;Reeker&quot; is a good low budget horror movie that in some moments recall &quot;Identity&quot; and &quot;Jacob&apos;s Ladder&quot; and with a great surprising conclusion. Unfortunately this supposed sequel in nothing more than a messy and unoriginal remake, using the same storyline in a different situation associated to a confused and boring screenplay; better off watching the original good movie again. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Pânico no Deserto 2&quot; (&quot;Panic in the Desert 2&quot;)",

The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn&apos;t seem to master or perhaps he doesn&apos;t care. &quot;Zodiac&quot; was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt&apos;s warmth wins over David Fincher&apos;s coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt&apos;s eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I&apos;m convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.",

      "reviewBody": "Monday June 19th 2006 I was watching the Independent Film Channel today and came across a movie by Italian filmmaker Nanni Moretti called &quot;Caro Diario&quot; In the film Moretti reflects on his life in three tales: &quot;On My Vespa&quot;, &quot;Islands&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;. In the first, (On My Vespa) he narrates while riding along and says &quot;I always wanted to be a dancer&quot; He reflects on the importance of dance in not only film and stage, but in life in general. Later on, while waiting for a beverage in an Italian juice store, he notices a television playing and the movie &quot;Mambo&quot; was playing. He knows the song and begins to sing and dance along with the (unfourtanatly) little known Sylvana Mangano as she does a unique version of the Mambo. Afterwards, at the outside café table his friend asks him what he was doing in the shop and he relates that he was watching a &quot;Strange scene, starring Sylvana Mangano and that it had effected him in a strange way. I went to IMDb and looked up Sylvana&apos;s name, only to find an amazing actress who was a big star in Italian film for a short time. She was married to Dino DeLaurentis and would have followed in the steps of Gina Lolobrigada and Sophia Loren had not she been married to DeLaurentis. Her most famous movie was &quot;Riso Amaro&quot; where she toiled ever so sexually in rice fields. She separated from DeLaurentis and lived out her life in Paris and Spain sewing tapestries. The scene was mesmerizing to me as well as Moretti and she was a beautiful and talented woman. Such is show BIz I guess!?! You can read the complete story of this unsung actress by entering &quot;Mambo&quot; in the search box on IMDb and clicking on the links. By the way, she never divorced Dino DeLaurentis and died in 1989.The movie &quot;Mambo&quot; originally had a completely different storyline, but was banned due to it&apos;s homosexual theme. Caro Diario is playing all this month on IFC channel.",

Mickey Rooney, a very young boy, has never been better cast, nor delivered a better performance. And despite the dream sequences not always being clearly distinguished from real time motion, one catches on quickly enough. Everyone, even Dick Powell, delivers his lines mellifluously, something that cannot be said for the 1999 version. There&apos;s more energy and zeal, more mystery and charm, more color(though B&amp;W) and clarity, despite its age. Remarkable performances under exellent direction work together to make the Bard sparkle, and the film enchant.",

      "reviewBody": "Here is a film I had wanted to see for some time and finally tracked down a low-quality bootleg video of. I am quite a fan of unusual films like this, although unlike the works of David Lynch or Alejandro Jodorowsky, the weirdness of this film comes naturally from the storyline and not from any intentional strangeness just for the sake of strangeness. William Castle has created a neat, compact, self-contained movie universe here, with the setting being an odd juxtaposition between a dark Gothic castle and sunny Northern California. I couldn&apos;t help but be reminded of Tim Burton&apos;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, another modern fairy tale about a mad but gentle genius and his near-mute misfit assistant in a dark old castle surrounded by a sunny &apos;50s style suburbia. In fact, call me crazy, but I will bet that Burton has seen this film before and was possibly inspired by it while making his own film. There are other similarities to that film: the genius dies leaving the misfit to fend for himself in the outside world, the villains are in a motorcycle gang, the misfit falls for a local blond teenage girl, and he also performs his &quot;magic&quot; for children in a school classroom. Also like the films of Burton, there is a mixture of visual motifs from the past and present, including silent-movie style story-cards, Alex North&apos;s heady music score, and a motorcycle gang. \n\nSadly missing, though, is a highly compelling storyline, but in this case style over substance is not such a bad thing. This film is hard to classify, as it is not completely horror, modern fairy tale, or art film. I think it would be best to classify it as an experimental curio - one of those films like &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, Jacques Tati&apos;s &quot;Playtime&quot;, &quot;Cabinet of Dr. Caligaryi&quot;, or &quot;El Topo&quot;, which have no conventional film equivalent yet continue to garner a following from a small group of adventurous filmgoers. If you are attracted to films such as these, you will not be disappointed with &quot;Shanks.&quot;",

Production values were OK and suitably epic-ish in feel. The wheels start to fall off though with Robert Morley as the Chinese Emperor, some throwback to his role in 55 DAYS IN PEKING and worse, mega-british James Mason as Kam Ling, as likely a chinese adviser to Morley as Adam Sandler playing Abraham Lincoln. In a minor role as Subatai, Kenneth Cope is struggling to hold down any credibility whatsoever, having been first-string comic relief to David Frost on the THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS TV show.\n\nNot for the epic Hall of Fame I&apos;m afraid!"

Had it say started at the sea and then retrospectively (getting there backwards) let the viewer to discover the whole, a viewer would personalize the idea and intentions better. In the movie on the other hand, one gets to be introduced to the &apos;normal&apos; person who gets clearly mad, arranging his life as a paranoic schizophrenic yet acting sanely as before so he even manages to lead a life of a star artist with ease. There are some great plot points like leaving of the loved, stealing of the identity, accidental death, unwanted? artistic praise, sea survival friendship. Unfortunately they are loosely connected with the hero&apos;s intentions that are depicted not deeply enough to make a good sense... hence a schizophrenic.",

That&apos;s a bit of a shame as at its best this resembles much higher profile fare like MILLIONAIRE&apos;S EXPRESS. It&apos;s another high action ensemble cast Hong Kong action comedy, which begins with a Sammo cameo before slowing down for an hour or so. It then picks up for a wonderfully bloody and exciting heroic climax. The middle section is a bit slow, admittedly, with some unwanted romance and the like dragging things out, but when the cast includes such luminaries as Teresa Mo, Max Mok, Shing Fui-on, Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung and Lo Lieh, it&apos;s hard to dislike or criticise it too much.",

This was made back in the day when Segal was in shape, did his own fight scenes and the film makers in question didn&apos;t have to resort to using lame CGI and camera tricks during action scenes. It has an edge that is just lost in these hideous later outings (the kind where an overweight, 54 year old man jumps from a moving train with 2 pistols and wipes out a squad of heavily armed thugs).\n\nThis time Segal is under the guise of DEA agent John Hatcher. He &quot;retires&quot; from the job shortly after loosing one of his colleagues in a deal gone wrong. Hatcher goes to visit his sister and niece to try and &apos;find his old self&apos;, whilst visiting he also encounters an old friend and military partner Max(Keith David). Hatcher and Max soon run into a bunch of ruthless Jamaican drug dealers who have moved in on the area, and their voodoo practising leader SCREWFACE...\n\nQue violence galore!!\n\nExpect bone breaking violence from this film, as Hatcher and Co. shoot, beat and tackle their way through the posse in order to save Hatcher and his family&apos;s lives-who have been &quot;marked for death&quot; by the gang. I would say this is one of Segal&apos;s most violent movies, and that is saying something.",

There are plenty of on camera interviews with those who knew her best-- several of whom admit hardly knew her at all. The structure of the script is excellent. It takes the viewer from her childhood be shuttled from one foster home to another, a brief &quot;real&quot; home with her own mother when she was 9 before her mother was committed to a mental institution and on through her brief marriage at the age of 16, the modeling career that lead her into the Hollywood life that confused and destroyed her. Naturally since this was made in 1964, some of what we know of her life today-- such as her affair with Kennedy and the alleged conspiracy that surround it were not covered, as well as the fact she was sexually abused as a child--but it is nonetheless thought-provoking and moving experience.",

      "reviewBody": "Stories of domestic abuse are often so unreal or surreal, if/when they are made into movies they often come off as unbelievable or too melodramatic, leaving the facts of the case alone to provide the emotional impact. The aesthetics of the film itself seem less of a priority. The acting and direction of Night and Fog are so pitch perfect, that even though the story starts at the end so we know the result and it&apos;s unraveled through flashbacks and police interrogations, it plays out like a mystery. It&apos;s not the what of what happened but the how of what happened that compels. And don&apos;t write off Jingchu Zhang as just another pretty face. She nails the part of an ambitious peasant girl from the heartland, in this case Sichuan, who appears to have made it to the top by marrying a Hong Kong man. Her sisters made it only halfway, marrying men from the industrial Shenzhen. This is the ladder of success many young women from the disadvantaged rural areas attempt to climb. No matter that many of the men they pursue, especially the ones from Hong Kong, might already have a wife.\n\nDirector Ann Hui places the micro of domestic abuse into a wider macro social context with such honesty it&apos;s scary. The film reveals a plight of a segment of the Chinese population it hurts to know about. Hui pushes hard on the social buttons of an issue that many would like to ignore, but that&apos;s what gives the film its power. This is one of the more painfully sad films I&apos;ve seen in a long time. I put it on when it was already way past my bed time, thinking I&apos;d just get a feel for it and fall asleep. Well, a feel for it I got, and ended up staring at it, bug-eyed, the entire two hour runtime.",

The giant octopus is rarely seen, and when it is, it&apos;s pretty much obvious that it&apos;s a regular octopus filmed at angles and with bubbles thrown in to demonstrate violence in the water. And despite the three stars having above-the-title billing, they really only have supporting roles, and none of them get to Roy Scheider the octopus. \n\nActually I think I have it all figured out. Trying to cash in on the Jaws craze, they commissioned people to create another sea monster but overreached in hiring stars and blew their whole budget on their salaries. There we go.",

The film does attempt to be a bit more than merely another porn flick and it seems like the director is trying to make some sort of social commentary, though of course the sex is always the star and for the most of the duration; I couldn&apos;t really care much less about what the film is trying to say. In terms of the sex scenes themselves; I have to say that there isn&apos;t much here that I haven&apos;t seen already in other porn films, but what makes this one stand out really is the music, which features throughout most of the film and gives it a feeling all of it&apos;s own. The film is a bit choppy and doesn&apos;t really follow a strict narrative - there are times when you are likely to know what is going on, and many when you won&apos;t have a clue. I can certainly recommend that hardcore fans check this one out because it is well worth seeing; but I wouldn&apos;t put it at the very top of the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a British murder mystery movie. It&apos;s not bad, though it&apos;s also not great; it tells a good story, though without being particularly engaging. Though modestly satisfying, the content feels less grabbing and noteworthy than the basics of the film&apos;s craft. Filming locations are fine and fetching, and set design and decoration no less so. I appreciate Jack Cardiff&apos;s direction, his keen eye for arranging shots and scenes, and for that matter the scene writing contributes a suitable level of tension and mystery to any given moment. I think the cast is fairly solid - yet with that having been said, what stands out the most to me about &apos;Penny Gold&apos; is the appearance of Francesca Annis. Beautiful, smart, and charming in her own right, Annis is given an opportunity to demonstrate welcome range and nuance, not least of all for rather having two roles here instead of just one. If there is a singular reason to watch this feature, Annis is it, as her performance is frankly commanding.\n\nI&apos;m divided on John Scott&apos;s score, as some themes seem very fitting for the mood of a given scene, while in many other instances it&apos;s overly playful - for example, during the opening credits, as police examine and move the body of a murder victim. Characters are given just enough personality and varied motivations to feel real, and breathe some life into the narrative. I think the movie is well made - and, happily, in the last third of the length a spark of thrilling vigor is summoned that revitalizes the picture, constituting all the terrific value that &apos;Penny Gold&apos; has to offer. This last stretch, leading into the climax and ending, is sharp and brilliant, and significantly boosts my overall opinion. I just wish that the rest of the feature were so absorbing, for the first two-thirds just don&apos;t make much of an impression. The result is that the title feels uneven; it&apos;s enjoyable, but just not quite as stimulating a cinematic experience as one would hope.\n\nRecommendable above all for utmost fans of the cast, or of British murder mysteries, there&apos;s nothing so dazzling about this as to make it an essential must-see. It&apos;s not that there&apos;s any one specific fault about it - although the very, very end is a tad contrived - only that too much of the runtime passes by without actively getting one&apos;s attention. Still, when all is said and done it&apos;s ultimately entertaining, and worthwhile on its merits. You don&apos;t need to go out of your way for &apos;Penny Gold,&apos; but if you happen upon it, it&apos;s a decent way to spend 90 minutes.",

I liked this film very much when I saw it about 25 years ago in the Cinématheque (long live Yugoslav and now Slovenian Kinoteka). Unfortunately, the copy wasn&apos;t as good as the film itself. There were some missing parts so I&apos;d like to check out this one again.\n\nWhat good movies Sydney Pollack made in his early days! I highly recommend his Slender Thread, The Scalphunters, They Shoot Horses..., Jeremiah Johnson and this one. Very unusual films for Hollywood standards, very brave, and as it seems timeless.\n\nIn an interview Mr. Pollack once said that he thinks Castle Keep was way ahead of its time. The audience wasn&apos;t ready to cope with such a look at war. I wonder if it is ready now? Castle Keep recommended to all non-formula film lovers around the world.\n\n9/10",

I was a big Dr Who fan anyway as a 12 year old, and this big screen colour adaptation of the 2nd Dr Who serial and first Dalek story was just what the Doctor ordered.\n\nIt never occurred to me, as a 12 year old in 1965, that the Doctor was a mere human and not a Time Lord from Gallifrey, and that was because, at the time, he was a mere human and not a Time Lord from Gallifrey on TV, too. That particular wrinkle wasn&apos;t introduced until long after the first couple of Dalek TV series and the two movies.\n\nThat said, while the film brings back fond memories, and is particularly good to see in widescreen, it is very much a product of its time, and specifically targetted at its market - youngsters who were mad keen on Daleks. That market is not there any more. The movie shows its age, and doesn&apos;t stand up that well to today&apos;s demands. For all that, there&apos;s still a genuine sense of jeopardy involved, the principals play well, the production values are (for the time and the UK cinema industry) very high, and it remains good, colourful innocent fun.",

The story is something about a villain in a skull mask and a ray that will disable electrical equipment, but who cares? It&apos;s really about the square-jawed scientist and his beautiful and plucky assistant dashing about risking death to bring the master criminal to justice, with constant fight scenes (filmed at a slower rate so that people move with astonishing speed onscreen) and cliffhanging endings.\n\nThere are plenty of unintentionally funny moments, too, as when the gang leader&apos;s right-hand-thug (played by Clayton Moore, eventually to be the TV version of The Lone Ranger) returns with a piece of equipment and the leader hisses that it&apos;s a &quot;cheap decoy&quot; (as if it looks any cheaper than anything else on the set).

      "reviewBody": "The video I saw of this film was on a label called Platinum Productions. It had been retitled as &quot;Black Rage&quot; and had this amazingly cruddy cover art with a white slaver threatening a black slave using what is very obviously a pruning saw (exactly like the one my grandmother uses on her shrubs). But don&apos;t judge a book by its cover. Even though the video quality of the tape was on the just adequate-to-fair side (I suspect that the tape was actually a bootleg), that didn&apos;t prevent me from ultimately really enjoying this film. It was clearly a labor of love, filmed (very clearly) on real Florida swamp locations (that must have been a real fun shoot), with mostly unknowns (Ted &quot;Lurch&quot; Cassidy is the only guy most people will probably recognize). But the subject matter is so unique (name me one other film set in 1859 about two slave brothers - one black the other albino - who find an old Spanish treasure map and spend the rest of the film on the run from bounty trackers through some of the roughest Florida swamp country this side of a women-in-prison movie) and the quality of the production values (great performances all around, terrific attention to period costuming and set decoration, attractive cinematography, even good sound recording) is so outstanding that this picture really won me over. It&apos;s too bad that Chris Robinson gave up directing (and producing, starring, writing...) his own material like this. I hope more people have a chance to see this distinctive, well-made film."

How can you give such a movie a 6.0 ?!\n\nAnd I certainly do not understand the negative comments on this excellent movie. Especially the acting performance of Hwang Jung-min in this action drama is unmatched!\n\nEveryone who loves Asian movies, with historical facts, drama, comedy and adventure MUST watch this movie!\n\nBlades of Blood contains everything; Comedy, action, humor, adventure and much more!\n\nI recommend this movie to anyone who is not afraid to see Asian movies. This movie is worth your money and time!\n\nAnyone who finds this movie bad is just a holly / Bollywood freak or does not have any sense of movies!\n\nIt&apos;s as easy as that.\n\nI personally prefer Korean movies and series over the rest.\n\nThe performances of the Koreans regularly exceed their other Asian rivals.\n\nGive a chance to Korean movies, and do not underestimate them.\n\nBlades Of Blood is a great movie to start with.\n\nGreetings",

Common self-reference points to the viewer defining the experience.\n\nBut Mingus used to say why have three threads when you can have seven? Here, some of the most adventurous thinkers in film give us four threads, actually four and a half.\n\nWe have the Chekhov play and the Mamet wrapping. Make no mistake that this is not an editing or a translation, but an annotation. We have two perspectives simultaneously. Add to that the notion of the play not as a play for an audience as intended, but an event conducted regularly by the performers for their own sake. This is a creation orchestrated by Gregory, the third thread. One can clearly see in some scenes neither Chekhov nor Mamet but artists collaborating in dialogs. The inner eyes and the outer eyes differ.\n\nFourth, we have Malle&apos;s creation which introduces us into the equation with deliberately shaky and sometimes misframed camerawork. We aren&apos;t part of any prior experience, but the actors do include the camera in their collaboration, as an independent thread. Watch how Andre works the camera.\n\nAnd finally, we have the framing of the artists in real life. This is not simultaneous with the others and in any case excludes the filmmaker.\n\nI recall seeing Paul Newman in the Color of Money in the first scene, acting on three levels simultaneously. It took my breath away. Here, the purpose of the whole contrivance is to challenge the actors (and the viewers!) to participate in a jazz ensemble of acting where the layer of reality is constantly shifting. They chose Uncle Vanya as the base for a reason, because his evershifting foci of love and hate in pairs provide cues for levelshifting. \n\nShawn really plays on this. His skill wasn&apos;t apparent to me on first viewing, especially in the first scenes, where all players are on stage and the non-focus actors have to be invisible. But on repeated viewings one can see his mastery, his shifting forehead! Maybe he could have been a Dostoyevsky. The two young women should be celebrated to the heavens for what they do together. I never believed so many giggles and gasps and stutters and excited silences could be so finely woven, tossed so lightly.\n\n This is really, really good stuff, very smart. So far as an intelligent construction you won&apos;t see a superior. I never expect to see four levels at once again in film at least centered in the acting."

With facial disfigurement and cigarette burns it took violence up a notch from the standard gun play of the past, making it grimmer and more realistic, and giving the story more punch. Grahme&apos;s tough and tender role stands out and gives the film a tragic element, while certain of its portrayals of greed and corruption (namely the dead officer&apos;s wife) stand out for their attention to detail. In the end, it IS the details that give this formulaic story its clout, and we can thank director Fritz Lang for that.",

George Sand was one of my best female characters next to Mary Wolstoncroft, Jane Austin, Emmeline Pankhurst and the famous five. Juliette Binoche has played the role magnificently close and made it feel like I was watching the original Sand.\n\nThe love story is so beautiful specially the scene when Benoit Magimel sleeps on the street ground under the rain when Sand comes to visit him in her carriage. Waw!... I mean this is a charming scene, it says a lot about the feelings of love."

      "reviewBody": "This highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing in a movie should be all about.  Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at.  The movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life.  \n\n   Along the way we are asked question after question about life.  Davis (Steve Martin with a great beard) asks himself &apos;Is my making a violent movie (and by extension  our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?&apos; Claire asks &quot;What kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?&apos;  Mack is not immune as he asks &apos;Is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and (an even harder step) finance?  These are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities.  Others ask their questions too, and to be honest it raises more than it answers.\n\n   But that is the nature of life.  We strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer, and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires.  As humans we thrive on questions we cannot answer.  Some answers are real.  Claire and Mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby, their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands.  Some answers are not.  Davis `Sees the Light&apos; and decides not to make violent films, but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art.\n\n   We all seek answers.  This movie does not answer them for; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard not to think of Sergio Leone when watching &apos;Death Rides A Horse&apos;, and not just because Leone is the king of spaghetti westerns. The connections are even closer than that. Lee Van Cleef (&quot;Angel Eyes&quot; in &apos;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&apos;) co-stars, and the supporting cast includes Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli, both familiar faces from Leone&apos;s Dollars trilogy. Plus it was written by Luciano Vincenzoni and scored by Morricone. Giulio Petroni however is the director instead of Leone. Maybe that&apos;s why it isn&apos;t as impressive as one might expect. Even so it&apos;s an underrated revenge thriller, and Van Cleef gives an excellent performance. He plays Ryan, an ex-con wanting some payback from a group of outlaws who double crossed him. John Phillip Law (&apos;Diabolik&apos;) is Bill, a young guy obsessed with avenging the rape and murder of his mother and the slaying of his father and sister. Pretty soon Bill crosses paths with Ryan and comes to realize that they after the same men. The two form an uneasy relationship which in many ways is that of a surrogate father and son. &apos;Death Rides A Horse&apos; may not be quite as great as Leone but it&apos;s still very good, and one of the better spaghetti westerns. It&apos;s particularly recommended to fans of Lee Van Cleef, who is just wonderful to watch."

      "reviewBody": "This film is about a woman working in a wedding planning agency. She handles her break up while dealing with clients looking for a dream wedding.\n\n&quot;Love Is Not Blind&quot; is surprisingly well made. From make up, costumes, set designs, cinematography, the quality across the board is very good. In the vein of &quot;500 Days Of Summer&quot;, &quot;Love Is Not Blind&quot; is fun, fluffy and a little quirky. I particularly like the set designs. Every scene looks as if it was lifted out from an modern interior design magazine. Even the way a dinner table is set is so stylish. Together with the portrayal of the dream wedding of ultra rich clients, this film reflects the rapidly changing society in mainland China.\n\nIt is a simple story but it touches the heartstrings. I like the way the leading girl is untainted by the materialism and extravagance. Her male colleague is funny, and the campness is so well portrayed but not over the top. Another impressive thing is that there are a number of really deep one liners that is thought provoking, such as whether love is a luxury and Louis Vuitton is a necessity.\n\nI really enjoyed &quot;Love Is Not Blind&quot;, and I look forward to China making more films of this calibre."

The movie employs every sugared done-to-death cliché.\n\nStrangely, the movie works. Mainly due to the actors, the very much underused Marisa Tomei is excellent and so is Hugh Jackman who has to play a cliché as well(anyone heard about reformed bad boys in a movie?). Ashley Judd is wonderful considering the bad lines she has to work with. So despite the lack of chemistry between actors, bad plot line that has more holes then a matrix-printer invoice it is a good romp to watch whilst doing admin or chopping up vegetables for a large salad.\n\nThis is pure oversweetened mass produced candy. We all know it is bad for our teeth but we cannot help by snatching a bite once in a while for some guilty enjoyment, as long as we don&apos;t overindulge of course:)",

And here is Lotta with her really weird way of setting things right by just belief in herself, and sometimes doing silly things like all of her age. It is a hit for your small ones about 5-7 year age but don&apos;t miss the opportunity to give yourself 80 minutes of time travel back to the days when you were young and rejoiced in a beautiful world. 8 out of 10 - this is a must see for all kids.",

      "reviewBody": "John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his &quot;negotiation skills,&quot; he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.\n\nBefore I saw this sequel, I had heard that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it&apos;s not as good as the original. The movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can&apos;t tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. The same can&apos;t be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.\n\nAn impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it&apos;s nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she&apos;s also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn&apos;t in the film for very long. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.\n\nF. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn&apos;t handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn&apos;t. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn&apos;t measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that&apos;s it. Rating 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Like so many films from the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, this one tries very hard to appear romantic, but in the end is only romantically interested about country itself. A reporter meets a man in a train, and the man, Sin Jun, starts telling him his life story. This is the classical narrative of a prodigal son. Initially Sin Jun, apparently a young man though looking 40, felt that since the previous generation worked hard enough to establish nice living conditions for North Koreans, this generation can take it easy, and not think about the generation after them. Of course this doesn&apos;t fly with the more morally sound citizens around him, like his city engineer father who is ashamed of his son.\n\nSin Jun&apos;s worldview starts to change, when he comes across Su Yang, a young girl with a flourishing military career and a proper work ethic. They meet several times, in Pyongyang, on the countryside and everywhere in between, and Sin Jun&apos;s pursuit of this woman is slowly turning him into the ideal worker. Though aiming for relatable romance, the film feels patronizing and only makes you think about working. The couple don&apos;t really have personalities outside the moralizing narrative. There are interesting scenes for cultural scholars and people interested in propaganda. In one scene, they work at a field and their combine harvester breaks down. Because oil is scarce, they decide to do the job manually, and make it fun for everyone by turning it into a speed contest. North Koreans are anything but subtle. This is not one of the better propaganda pieces from the isolated country.",

      "reviewBody": "This thrilling picture titled Kinjite (which means &quot;to forbid&quot; in English) contains suspense , noisy action-packed , intrigue , thrills and lots of violence . The meaning and relevance of this movie&apos;s title is that it refers to subjects such as sex, child molesting, prostitution which are forbidden topics in Japanese culture . It deals with the cop Lt. Crowe (Charles Bronson , he was about sixty-seven years of age) who takes on a pimp (Juan Fernandez) and a slimy hoodlum (Sy Richardson) whose speciality is recruiting adolescents including the daughter of a Japanese business man (James Pax). The lieutenant married to Kathleen (Peggy Limpton) has a teenager girl (Amy Hathaway) and is helped by another policeman (Perry Lopez). He then stalks the baddies and takes the law into his own hands , acting as judge , jury and executioner ; searching vengeance on crooks , pimps making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum.\n\nThis standard Bronson movie is full of action , thrills, and disturbing scenes . Bronson in his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . This is the last movie Charles Bronson made for Cannon Films and it represents the tenth and final of ten teamings between producer Pancho Kohner and star actor Bronson . It&apos;s certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Lt. Crowe Bronson&apos;s side . Disagreeable scenes and loathing theme as abuse of children with terrible end . Screen debut from Baywatch&apos;s Nicole Eggert as a teen prostitute and Danny Trejo as an inmate in a final brief appearance -almost extra- . Unappropiated and anti-climatic musical score composed by means of synthesizer . \n\nThe fare was badly directed by J. Lee Thomson , in his last one , he previously had a nice track record in the English cinema from 1950 until 1961 , directing good Western (McKenna&apos;s gold , White Buffalo) and all king genres as Sci-Fi (Conquest and Battle of planet of apes), terror (reincarnation of Peter Proud, Eye of the devil), adventures (Flame over India ,Kings of the sun, Taras Bulba , Tiger Bay) and Warlike (Guns of Navarone, Von Braun , Chairman , The passage) . His two biggest successes turned out to be ¨Guns of Navarone¨and ¨Cape Fear¨. Thereafter , the filmmaker&apos;s career subsided in a morass of slickly realized but middling films . He moved into the field of international spectaculars , at which point his filmmaking seemed to lose its individuality . J. Lee Thompson working from the 50s in England, finished his career making Chuck Norris (Firewalker) and Charles Bronson vehicles (Caboblanco, Evil that men do , Messenger of death, Death Wish 4 : Crackdown, Caboblanco, St Ives). Rating : Below average . Lousy results for this disagreeable thriller that has many depressing failures.",

It feels like Blade Runner, but without action, epic lines, futuristic worlds and people hunting synthetics.\n\nSo what is left? There&apos;s a great cast. They really do discuss relationships between people and synthetics a lot, lots of moody moments and things to ponder. However, unlike other romantic films I didn&apos;t really care if they got together. Zoe whether a real person or synthetic is physically beautiful, but the conversation between her and Ewan McGregors character is all whispery and lacking in flirtatiousness. Was this meant to be? If so she played it perfectly, but either way the romance is neither here nor there. There&apos;s no action so overall this film is just a bit long and odd.",

Then I couldn&apos;t find another copy for the longest time. It&apos;s a great movie, 10 years almost and I still remembered it. Finally I found another copy on-line. Watch this movie. It&apos;s about a boy, Bodo, who&apos;s constantly picked on by a group of bullies, and to complicate the fact he has a crush on the lead bullies girlfriend, Nova. Not thinking he could ever get her, he about gives up. He clones himself and the clone is stronger, faster and smarter, and also talks a lot. The clone is able to defend itself and impress Bodo, but does she love Bodo, or Bodo 2? Watch this movie, it rules.",

I was glad I did.\n\nFilmed over a number of years this is a solid, sometimes poetic, very sad film about the building of a garbage dump in the picturesque sea-side Turkish town of Camburnu, and how it slowly destroyed the town and its way of life. Eco horror stories like this are nothing new, but Akin&apos;s humanist approach makes us care by letting us get to know and like some of the crucial people of the town – like the mayor – who are fighting an endless uphill battle against the damage the lying and disinterested central government is wreaking on them. \n\nThese people are no rural rubes – they seem to know more about the law and even the engineering flaws of the dump&apos;s construction than the pathetic men who are supposed to be in charge. Inspiring at times, depressing and defeating at others, it&apos;s not the first film to show how greed and indifference is undermining our world, but it&apos;s a strong and human example.",

Barden (Roman Bohnen) is a weak man, and the institution is actually ruled by the ambitious and sadistic Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyon), who uses violence, fear and treachery to control the prisoners. After the suicide of Tom Lister (Whit Bissell), one of the inmates of cell R17, provoked by Captain Munsey, the prisoners loses their privileges and rest of the group of cell R-17 leaded by Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) is sent to hard and insalubrious work in the drain pipe. Joe uses a successful strategy of war trying to escape, attacking the tower of the penitentiary from the outside with his men, and from inside with the team leaded by the leader Gallagher (Charles Bickford). However, the plan fails, ending in a bloodshed.\n\nSixty years after the original release date, &quot;Brute Force&quot; is still a great movie of prison. The story is very well constructed, with flashbacks showing the connection of three inmates with his women. The violence is not explicitly disclosed like in the present days, but the cruelty of Captain Munsey can be understood even by the most naive viewer. The direction of Jules Dassin is outstanding with many memorable scenes. Yvonne De Carlo has a minor participation, but a strong role. The moralist message in the end, when Dr. Walters (Alt Smith) tells that nobody can escape from penitentiaries, does not spoil this great movie. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Brutalidade&quot; (&quot;Brutality&quot;)",

Every scene was something else, you could never figure out how it was gonna end. But there were some loose ends, where you got information but no answer. If we were to get the information for that, then I would rate it higher. The beginning and the end is so different from each other. It&apos;s a good movie to watch on a late night when your in a mood for a thriller. You don&apos;t really need to focus that hard to understand the movie. I would say that from 15 years and older are a good age to watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is about a episode that happened in 1944. When France was still occupied by the Nazis, they decided to steal paintings from the Paris museums. This film is about a shipment that the French has to save before he ends to Germans, but they also don&apos;t want to be destroyed in the process.\n\nBurt Lancaster stars as a French train engineer that has to transport the shipment. At first is not a easy task, but he succeeds in the end. Meanwhile he becomes friend with a hotel owner played by French actress Jeanne Moreau (that passed away last year). And the other members of the cast are fine. Paul Scofield as a German general is great (and Scofield also starred in other great movies after this), and it was a treat seeing French comedian Michel Simon in a war movie (just like Bourvil in THE LONGEST DAY).\n\nThis movie had great direction by John Frankenheimer, great performances by all the actors, and also great photography in Black and White. Although a bit dragged in some places, it was still great to watch! And as a fan of the history from 1850 until these days, I liked the movie for his accuracy and his action scenes.",

McCoy is some sort of British scout; Crawford is a daughter of a French general, and complications ensue, including an Indian attack that must have been impressive looking in 1927, but in the print I saw, was a challenge just to tell who was who(m).\n\nCrawford wears a blonde wig and white clothing for the first twenty minutes, and is almost totally washed out as a result. She changes back to brunette twenty some minutes in for the rest of the film. I can&apos;t criticize anything but the quality of the print. If you want to see this rarity and it turns up, don&apos;t delay; if I thought this was an easily available film, I would have quit watching after a minute or so .\n\nI&apos;m not rating this one because the bad quality of the print I saw completely overwhelms any good features the film might have had."

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re looking for a pulse-pounding horror thriller, you won&apos;t find that here. If you&apos;re looking for a spooky ghost story, you might want to move on. If you&apos;re looking for blood &amp; guts &amp; body parts, don&apos;t even waste a minute of your time.\n\n&quot;The Eye&quot; isn&apos;t so much a horror flick as it is a supernatural drama.\n\nThis film is a remake of the 2002 Chinese &quot;The Eye&quot; which I haven&apos;t seen, so I can&apos;t (and probably shouldn&apos;t) compare the two. I thought this was a nicely done film, more of an intimate character study than a scary &quot;gotcha&quot; flick. In that respect it&apos;s similar to &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and not just the story. Like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; which was a slow moving psychological drama that just happened to have dead people in it, &quot;The Eye&quot; takes a personal approach as well. And while that may bore the audience members who are expecting some screams, it ultimately results in a film with a little bit more to say than your average screamer.\n\nJessica Alba (&quot;Sydney&quot;) does a great job of playing a woman who has been blind since age 5, a loner, someone who doesn&apos;t seem to have many connections with people and she likes it that way. The underlying theme is that her blindness makes her feel unique, exempt from the real world. When she regains her sight after 15 years by a corneal transplant, it&apos;s not necessarily the wonderful experience you&apos;d expect. There&apos;s a scene when she comes back from the hospital to a surprise party, and the scene is filmed with unsettling, distorted closeups of strange faces. It perfectly expresses the confusion and claustrophobia of not just a blind person gaining her sight, but that of an introvert being forced into society. That enough could&apos;ve been enough for a feature length film: how a woman deals with the &quot;gift&quot; of sight which she doesn&apos;t really want. But it doesn&apos;t end there. She starts seeing dead people, too.\n\nWhile we never really feel like Sydney is in any deadly peril, there are a few very effective surprises which, I gotta admit, quickened my pulse a few notches. Also the &quot;shadow men&quot; were very creepy, and if you want to see a real shocker, check out the bonus features where we learn that the shadow men are not cgi graphics, but it&apos;s an actual dude... a sort of living skeleton who looks just as bizarre in real life than on screen.\n\nThe 2nd half of the film becomes a mystery as Sydney tries to figure out why she&apos;s getting these disturbing visions and what she&apos;s supposed to do about it. Again, no hair raising car chases or shootouts here, just a thick atmosphere of the unknown.\n\nLike I said, I haven&apos;t seen the original Chinese film, but I can tell that the American filmmakers were trying to add a degree of backstory. In the bonus features they talk about the science of &quot;cellular memory&quot; (the idea that donated organs possess characteristics that are imparted to the new recipient). So I can assume that this is less of a visceral shocker (like the original?) as it is an intellectual approach. There&apos;s also the psychology bit I mentioned above. And it also touches on the idea that artists, musicians &amp; creative thinkers are more sensitive to supernatural events (Sydney is a concert violinist). In short, &quot;The Eye&quot; sacrifices the raw approach of a typical action-horror flick, and instead replaces it with more of a slow-moving, scientific or &quot;rational&quot; approach to the supernatural.\n\nDepending on your preference, that&apos;s a good or bad thing. I can go either way depending on my mood; once in a while I like to think, whereas other times I just want to see Freddy slice some people to ribbons. &quot;The Eye&quot; definitely falls on the thinking side of that scale. Other thinking horror flicks I recommend are &quot;Exorcist III&quot; (one of the BEST), &quot;The Others&quot; with Nicole Kidman, and of course &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.",

It tells the story of a couple of Arab kids growing up on the mean streets of Hackney, where they must intermingle with drug gangs and adult life in a bid to make something of their lives - or merely survive.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I&apos;ve seen all this sort of thing before in the likes of Noel Clarke&apos;s KIDULTHOOD and ADULTHOOD, plus the wave of films along the same line that have been made over the past decade, and MY BROTHER THE DEVIL doesn&apos;t really have much more to say on the subject, other than to make a point of how ridiculous, violent, and difficult it all is. Director Sally El Hosaini elicits some strong performances from her young, unknown cast members, and the film is certainly watchable from beginning to end. But it&apos;s too familiar and fatalistic to have much of an impact on this viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "Arguably the best Bruce Lee documentary available at the moment, and I&apos;ve pretty much seen every one that is available. Having grown up idolising the great man and having seen all his movies countless times, when I first saw the &quot;Curse of the Dragon&quot; documentary I was most intrigued by an interview which was conducted with Bruce&apos;s long time friend, colleague and training partner Dan Inosanto where Bruce&apos;s original concept for &quot;Game of Death&quot; was brought to light. Inosanto made mention of the 5-floor pagoda idea and immediately I made it my mission to somehow find this lost footage.\n\nSome years later I have finally been privileged as well as honoured to see the long lost footage from the final battle scenes in &quot;Game of Death&quot; and to see the master in action for one final time. All I can say is that the &quot;Game of Death&quot; footage alone is worth the price of admission and any true Bruce Lee fan will be left salivating after seeing the incredible fight scenes coupled with the philosophical undertones that Lee so wanted to convey to his students, fans and audiences alike.\n\nThe lost footage aside, the documentary is also quite solid with excellent insight into Bruce&apos;s philosophy and his incredible determination and integrity which truly made him a master in his respective trade. While other documentaries often focused on his meteoric rise to stardom and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his untimely death, this documentary chooses rather to focus on his life, his teachings, his way of thought and his remarkable achievements - all of which made him a legend.\n\n10/10",

But then, I re-watched it recently during the AMC tribute to the late great Kate.  On second viewing, I found a lot about it endearing and quite humorous.\n\nAlthough the technology is antiquated, the reaction to change in an organization is not.  Speaking from an EEO perspective, Hepburn&apos;s boyfriend would be a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen in today&apos;s world. However, the office politics are identical to the office politics today. Instead of using the telephone to gossip, people in the office now use email.\n\nTracy and Hepburn gave great performances in this light-hearted romantic comedy.  The scene in Hepburn&apos;s apartment is hilarious.  Her reaction to her boyfriend&apos;s suggestion that he thought she would be alone is priceless. And, when Tracy stumbles out, we get to see Hepburn&apos;s uncontrollable laughter (that was probably not scripted) which always makes me lol.\n\nSo, take a second look if you first didn&apos;t like this movie."

      "reviewBody": "Going to see this was a bit of a gamble for me. I didn&apos;t feel convinced that this film would be worthwhile, based as it is on a funny, but not terribly dramatic news story about the robbery of a Rembrandt painting. I was, in the end, positively surprised, even at Lars Brygmann&apos;s unusual role which I would have thought was out-of-character for him.\n\nIn fact, director Jannik Johansen has made a very strong and convincing story from the actual event which inspired him. The fact that the robbers stole the Rembrandt by mistake rather than by intent proves a good starting point for a comic screenplay full of surprise, distrust and, eventually, disappointment. The latter is no spoiler, for it is almost a given that a Danish crime plot on film will not depict the problem-free victory of the crooks, but rather the opposite. &quot;Rembrandt&quot; might, as such, remind many viewers of the famous &quot;Olsen-Banden&quot; series.\n\nActors which work well in a comic, but also dramatic and personal setting are instrumental here. The film succeeds very well, especially with before-mentioned Lars Brygmann, the super-expressive Nicolas Bro and the bold, young Jacob Cedergren for whom this is the first major film role since his breakthrough in the TV series &quot;Edderkoppen&quot;. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is all right as the fourth gang member, but his part lacks perspective and importance, in part due to the fact that the ending of the film doesn&apos;t involve his character adequately. Søren Pilmark, Sonja Richter and Paprika Steen are the most noteworthy of the additional cast, all in solid performances.\n\nRembrandt is not by any means a revelation, nor does it attract much attention for cinematography or additional crafts, but it works on all levels and, notably, successfully adds a serious and personal angle to its humour.",

Long story short, it met and exceeded my expectations, unlike the SP aired in 2006.\n\nWhat I love most about this movie was that after 5 minutes, it felt like I was brought back to the world of HERO dorama series. This movie was directed well enough for cinema, yet it retained all the great qualities we HERO fans are familiar with from the TV series. A lot of dorama SPs (including the HERO SP) and movie adaptations have failed in this respect, and many others failed to make it to silver screen standards (i.e. GTO, Saiyuuki, even 1L no Namida felt like a made-for-TV SP) but HERO staff succeeded in this movie where so many others failed. The producers of this film didn&apos;t forget about the fans by providing some information for unanswered questions from the dorama series and SP, and connects the stories in dorama, SP, and the movie in a convincing manner. \n\nAll the main character&apos;s funny habits still makes me laugh, and the interactions between Kuryuu and Amemiya were great as usual. The chemistry between all the main cast was perfect even after all these years. It must be this bond that united ALL the original cast even after 6 years, in which time Abe Hiroshi has become a major presence in Japanese cinema, yet still returns in supporting role.\n\nThe cast in this movie is absolutely incredible, with KimuTaku, still popular as ever; Abe Hiroshi, as mentioned; Kohinata Fumiyo, who has also become a major presence in cinema and TV, though still in supporting roles; Ayase Haruka and Nakai Kiichi in same character as SP; Matsumoto Koushirou, multiple-award-winning stage actor, 9 years since his last film appearance; Tamori, the great MC of Wratte Iitomo and Music Station, 17 years since his last film appearance; even Korean actor Lee Byung-hun and many other recognizable faces in supporting roles.\n\nNot only did this movie made me laugh and was a star galore, there were also many moving and inspirational scenes. The story was very well-written and it was very well-directed. The ending completely caught me off-guard. I absolutely loved the dorama series&apos; leave-the-rest-to-your-imagination ending, but the movie ending was just as good, surprise ending fitting for this great franchise. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the lack of Utada Hikaru&apos;s &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; as theme song (understandable, but it felt like something was missing), and a few unnecessary scenes to recreate the greatest scenes in the dorama series.\n\nI&apos;ve seen MANY dorama series and movies since HERO in 2001, but watching this movie once again reminded me that Kuryuu Kouhei is one of the greatest character ever created by Japanese live-action writers. I recommend watching the entire dorama series before the movie. It&apos;s definitely worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar is the second biggest blockbuster of Amitabh to date after Sholay and when you watch this movie you feel that it deserves too.Prakash Mehra was in top form in this movie he made some other top movies with Amitabh like Sharaabi,Lawaaris,Zanjeer,Namak Halal,Hera Pheri but Muqaddar Ka Sikandar was his best, in my opinion.\n\nSTORY:-A poor orphan boy is kept as a servant by a man named Ramnath in Shimla but the boy is outsed when he delovopes a friendship with Ramnath&apos;s daughter Kaamna,Ramnath shifts to Mumbai with Kaamna and the orphan reaches Mumbai searching for Kaamna .In Mumbai the orphan boy is adopted by a Muslim woman named Fatima who names the orphan Sikandar.Fatima works as a servant for Ramnath in Mumbai.On Kaamna&apos;s birthday Sikandar steals a favourite doll of Kaamna from a shop and as he is secretly placing the doll in Kaamna&apos;s room Ramnath catches and falsely accuses him of theft and beats him up and removes Fatima also from his house, even Kaamna believes that Sikandar is a thief. Fatima dies of a heart attack leaving the responsibility of her younger daughter Mehroo on Sikandar.After burying Fatima, Sikandar meets Fakir Darvesh Baba(Kader Khan)who advises him to embrace sadness in life as it is faithful and remains with us forever whereas happiness in momentary and hence not trustworthy and this wouls make him the master of his fate(Muqaddar Ka Sikandar) which Sikandar decides to follow.\n\nSikandar(Amitabh) grows up and becomes rich by giving information of smuggled goods to police and receiving cash awards, as a result smugglers become Sikandar&apos;s enemy. Sikandar has set up his business and looks after Mehroo,he still loves Kaamna but Kaamna does not.Ramnath is not rich any more and has become very old.Whenever Sikandar tries to confess his love to Kaamna she refuses as she regards him as a thief and a betrayer to her family.As a result Sikandar starts drinking and visting Zohra Beghum&apos;s(Rekha)Kotha regularly.Once Sikandar is saved by a bomb attack planned by his smuggler enemies by a young advocate Vishal(Vinod Khanna)so Sikandar befriends him and also arranges a also arranges a case for him.Zohra Beghum is falls in love with Sikandar but a crimnal Dilawar(Amjad Khan)loves Zohra and as soon he escapes from the jail and goes to Zohra&apos;s kotha searching for Sikandar as soon as she finds Sikandar a fight ensues between them in which Sikandar beats up Dilawar.Dilawar swears to kill Sikandar.\n\nKaamna discovers Sikandar&apos;s kindness to her family and goes to thank him. Encouraged, Sikandar tries to profess his love to Kaamna through a love letter. Because Sikandar himself is illiterate, Vishal transcribes the letter for him, but the plan backfires when Kaamna mistakes the letter as actually being from Vishal. Vishal, unaware that Kaamna is the girl Sikandar loves, falls in love with her, and the two begin to date. Sikandar, upon learning this, struggles with his emotions but decides he must sacrifice his love for the sake of his friendship with Vishal.\n\nSikandar&apos;s visits to Zora Begum have hampered his reputation. His sister(Mehroo&apos;s) marriage is in dire straits because of this habit. Vishal then visits Zora and offers to pay her for the rest of his life if she would let Sikandar go. Zora, upon learning the reason, promises Vishal that she would die before letting Sikandar visit her again. Sikandar arrives at Zora&apos;s in the evening and Zora refuses to let him in. Sikandar demands entry, and when Zora is unable to stop him she swallows a diamond and lets Sikandar in, only to die in his arms.\n\nDilawar in the meanwhile has formed an alliance with Sikandar&apos;s arch smuggler enemy JD(Ranjeet)and upon learning of Zora&apos;s death hatches a plan to destroy Sikandar and his family. Dilawar kindaps Kaamna but Sikandar sees them and follows him. JD and his henchmen kidnap Sikandar&apos;s sister Mehroo but Vishal follows them and rescues her.\n\nSikandar rescues Kaamna and sends her home while he battles Dilawar. In the final battle both Dilawar and Sikandar are mortally wounded, and Sikandar tells Dilawar that he never loved Zora. A dying Sikandar reaches the wedding of Kaamna and Vishal. Just as the wedding ceremony is completed, Sikandar collapses. His dying words inadvertently reveal his love for Kaamna, and Vishal sings him his favourite song &quot;Life is going to betray you someday...Death is your true love as it&apos;ll take you along...&quot; Sikandar&apos;s entire life flashes before him and he dies in Vishal&apos;s arms just as the song is completed.\n\nAmitabh was brilliant as Sikandar which had a mix of his &quot;angry young man&quot; image as well as a that of a &quot;doomed lover&quot; watch his scenes when he beats up Amjad Khan or when he breaks into a Shayari during &quot;Salaam-E-Ishq&quot; song or his speech before &quot;O Saathi Re&quot; song or the climax scene he oozes confidence in every scene. Vinod Khanna was very good and efficient, Rekha was great as the the Mujra dancer Zohra who falls in love with Sikandar, Raakhee was decent, Amjad Khan was good as usual in the villain role,Kader Khan was excellent as the &apos;fakir&apos;, Nirupa Roy is perfect in her short role, Ranjeet fits his role..\n\nThe script by Vijay Kaul,Kader Khan and Laxmikant Sharma is great and now we come to the biggest strength of this movie:- \n\nTHE MUSIC by Kalyanji-Anandji is just excellent with superb songs like &apos;Rote Hue Aate Hain Sab&apos;,&apos;O Saathi Re&apos;,&apos;Wafa Jo Na Ki To&apos;,&apos;Dil To Hai Dil&apos;,&apos;Pyaar Zindagi Hai&apos;,&apos;Salaam E Ishq&apos;,&apos;Zindagi To Bewaafa Hai&apos;.\n\nA movie you can&apos;t afford to miss, because this movie is the complete package it has everything action, romance,comedy specially the emotional quotient of this movie is too strong, you might shed a couple of tears in the climax scene...",

      "reviewBody": "Herr Dziga Vertov was certainly one of the most important film directors in the history of the U.S.S.R., an innovative director, documentary maker and film theorist who used cinematography as the perfect vehicle for his artistic endeavors, achievements not always fully understood or shared by either his colleagues or the Soviet authorities.\n\nHerr Dziga Vertov&apos;s film style &quot;Kino-Glaz&quot; ( Cinema Eye ) reflects perfectly the artistic concerns that the Russian director had in the mid 20&apos;s, films wherein the use of editing is fundamental in order to put in images Herr Vertov&apos;s film artistic theories about the camera capturing reality. However, this is something of a contradiction because editing is in a certain way the manipulation of reality &quot;Shestaya Chast Mira&quot; ( One-Sixth Of The World ) (1926) was commissioned by Gostorg, an agency of the Russian Government. Not surprisingly, the film is a paean to the powerful possibilities of the U.S.R.R., a big country composed of an enormous diversity of people, races and nationalities, masters of the sixth part of the world who will put their efforts in the service of their country to make it a world power.\n\nHerr Vertov shows us many industrial sequences, the exporting of Soviet goods and a detailed ethnographical study of the many peoples that make up the Soviet Union. It is masterful propaganda. The use of editing is certainly astonishing and obviously fundamental for this kind of picture wherein different shots and sequences melt together to convey a political message and an artistic study, including fascinating camera angles and film techniques like split screens, animation and the travelling camera. All this creates mesmerizing film collage as fascinating as the extinct U.S.R.R. itself.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must ask for the whole part of his inheritance from one of his Teutonic rich heiresses.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",

Dakota Fanning puts on the typical scary little girl show to a above average level, and the cinematic action will make you squirm in your seat a few times. Therefore this movie isn&apos;t one that I would say you definitely need to see, but if you have some time to waste its a pretty good time. Also it gets bonus points for being a good date movie. The absolute worst thing about this movie is its lack of humor, though the dark overtones are necessary for a true horror movie there needs to be an element of humor(saving The Exorcist), even the Ring had its moments at the beginning with the two girls in the bedroom, this movie has no humor which makes us feel very little for the characters. This is the major downfall, but its still worth a viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very visual film. By that I mean that the dialog is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes, beginning with the opening shot.\n\nThe silences, however, are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant, staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins, and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. It&apos;s a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street, so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman, that he walks into a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store...\n\nA long time ago, another movie  Love Story (1970) -- said that love is never having to say you&apos;re sorry. This narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways, beginning with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Everyday, week in, week out, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his solitude  and he&apos;s been doing it for ten years. He sits, he observes, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you&apos;ll find out about when you see this little masterpiece...\n\nLove is explored in another way, in a direct counterpoint to Titta&apos;s solitude and reserved nature: two older residents of the hotel are still much in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes, while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests, one of whom is Titta. Now, Titta knows about their squabbles, their love, the man&apos;s cheating, his apologies to his wife, and his whining. How? In a surprising and black-comedic manner...one of those surprise activities I mentioned.\n\nBut, this is no comedy, in reality, although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a Balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. He keeps in touch occasionally, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes. But, there&apos;s something more than just sorrow...\n\nSuch a life as Titta&apos;s would obviously seem to be utterly boring, and it actually is from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death-like countenance, however, that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes. But not before we know that the female bartender, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and goes out of her way to pique Titta&apos;s interest in her.\n\nAnd that&apos;s when things start to unravel for Titta: he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in a most spectacular fashion.\n\nI know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; but, to say more would spoil the film and story for you. If you like Italian cinema  I love it!  I urge you to see this one. The acting is superb; the sound track chills the spine; the camera work is truly innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist.\n\nI know I&apos;ll see this movie again, and again...",

Samuel L Jackson&apos;s charismatic performance is what makes this movie great.\n\nThe marketing behind this movie is truly unique in that it is exactly what it says it is and almost nothing else!

Openings mights might include spotlights, the stars emerging from limos, etc. However, the introduction of videotape seems to have ended it all (well portrayed in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;). The adult film industry has for the most part gone downhill since this so-called &quot;golden age.&quot;  The DP scene so daringly depicted in the film is commonplace today."

Basically, the producers deliver what is expected:  adolescent humour, lots of young girls scantily clad, atrocious 70&apos;s music and outfits that would make Cher look like a groovy dresser, wooden performances, John Carradine in yet another laughable part, tissue-thin plot, and so on.  Four teenaged cheerleaders and their teacher, all beautiful and partially clothed, get lost on route to a football game.  They eventually are given a ride by the janitor at the school who has been ogling them through holes in the wall, and just happens to belong to a coven of Satanists led by sheriff Bub, played by John Ireland.  The janitor takes them on a ride only to get knocked out after attempting to rape the blonde that seems to have powers. The girls manage to get away and go to the sheriff for help, only to discover that he is their worst nightmare(not really as nothing in this film is even close to being suspenseful).  The rest...really is very trite and uninteresting, except for its comic appeal to afficionados of bad cinema. The film boasts quite an impressive line-up of famous character actors(all of them wasted) with Ireland, Carradine, Yvonne De Carlo, and Sydney Chaplin(the funniest of the cast).  The girls are dirty-minded and everything they say has some double meaning.  At least they are not shy, a small point in the film&apos;s favor.  Watch at your own risk, but certainly good for an evening of laughs..the unintended kind."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Iris&quot; tells of British novelist Iris Murdoch and her husband as they struggle together with her Alzheimer&apos;s affliction. The couple is portrayed in youth by Winslet and Bonneville and in old age by Dench and Broadbent with all delivering sterling performances. The plaintive and wistful story is told through interleaving scenes of the older couple&apos;s struggle with moments from the younger couple&apos;s life. As far as it goes, the film is an excellent product. What it doesn&apos;t deliver, however, is a deep sense of Murdoch, her philosophies and complexities of thought thereby giving greater depth to the character and a sense of the significance of what she is losing. In short, the film dwells too much on the disease and too little on the woman. Recommended for more mature viewers (B+)",

The scientist thought the results would make for a more interesting study from bad people, because good people are so boring - as he explains.\n\nIt seems that artificial insemination sparked fears and ideas in people of the early 1900s... but a fairly interesting film came from it. There are better sci-fi horror films of the 1950s but this one is still worth a one time watch.\n\n6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.\n\nWithin minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.\n\nThe scope of Tolkien&apos;s masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien&apos;s imagination.\n\nBut even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you&apos;ve-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen&apos;s portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood&apos;s Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I&apos;ve seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven&apos;t seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.\n\nThose unfamiliar with Tolkien&apos;s world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn&apos;t need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.\n\nThe movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.\n\nJackson&apos;s ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you&apos;ve seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.\n\nFor everyone else: don&apos;t you dare miss it."

The story is great, inventive &amp; experimental and the movie would have been better had the two newcomers not acted &amp; showed how they CAN&apos;T act at all and a more careful plot.\n\nThe screenplay &amp; editing has to be appreciated here. But the cheapness filled in the dialogs, songs &amp; certain characters spoils the whole broth which is enjoyable till it hits the interval. After that, the melodrama unfolds and the movie ends particularly noting a possible sequel.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A jolly good entertainer but let me remind you, the base &amp; dialogs are tad adult so you might not want to watch this before a family. Otherwise, Chettayees is a one-time watchable movie with your teenage/like-minded friends.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

Some, like Tim Burton, have assimilated his visual style into their own. Others have been more flippant in their appropriation of Argentoisms, with Quentin Tarantino lifting the music from The Bird with the Crystal Plumage for use in Death Proof, and Diablo Cody including a conversation debating the merits of Argento relative to H.G. Lewis in Juno. In effect, &quot;Argento&quot; has become something of a buzzword for a certain type of movie brat: a slightly edgy (but not too edgy) name they can mention to show that they&apos;re a little off the beaten track (but not too far off).\n\nOddly enough, Giallo represents something of a hybridization of the director&apos;s self-referentiality and the sort of fan idolatry that champions his films for their more superficial elements while ignoring the qualities that truly mark them out. Although the first credit at the end of the film reads &quot;written and directed by Dario Argento&quot;, the original script in fact originated from two American fans, Jim Agnew and Sean Keller, with Argento essentially being brought on as a director for hire. This is not the first time this has happened: the two episodes he directed for the largely disappointing Masters of Horror series also originated from other writers, much to their detriment. (If Pelts had been directed by Eli Roth, I doubt it would have been appreciably different.) While Giallo&apos;s script is nothing remarkable, the overall execution is handled with considerably more flair than Jenifer or Pelts. This may be because Argento is on familiar stomping ground, with the Italian locations lending an air of natural class. Giallo is far from the bland, anonymous piece of work for hire that many feared it would be. While Frederic Fasano&apos;s cinematography lacks the verve of a Tovoli or even a Debie, and Marco Werba&apos;s Herrmannesque score alternates between effective and intrusive, there are little Argentoisms throughout, mainly in the lightly humorous moments. Likewise, an early sequence at an opera recalls Argento&apos;s 1987 masterpiece of the same name, while the oddly ambiguous final frame is reminiscent of The Cat O&apos; Nine Tails.\n\nThat said, Giallo&apos;s most direct counterpart is The Card Player, and it&apos;s tempting to see them as two sides of the same coin. However, while The Card Player was clinical, high-tech and almost bloodless, Giallo goes in the opposite direction. Its set design hearkens back to the past, from Avolfi&apos;s dingy basement office to the foregrounding of Turin&apos;s picturesque monuments and buildings. The violence is also ramped up a notch, and it&apos;s tempting to view the film as Argento&apos;s reaction to the recent spate of so-called &quot;torture porn&quot; movies. The director has made conflicting statements as to his opinion of these films, but the lengthy scenes of Elsa Pataky being menaced and tortured in the killer&apos;s grimy underground lair are more reminiscent of Saw or Hostel than anything in Argento&apos;s past filmography.\n\nAnd there&apos;s the rub: despite being marketed as a return to the genre that made a name for Argento in the 1970s, Giallo... well, isn&apos;t actually a giallo. The plot operates more as a cross between a cop thriller and a gore-soaked torture flick, the title referring solely to the killer&apos;s jaundiced skin. His face is seen almost from the start and his identity is ultimately not hugely important. Far more interesting is the way in which he and Avolfi are constructed as two sides of the same coin, both pariahs who operate in dark underground lairs and have suffered violent, traumatic pasts. As with much of his past work, Argento seems to be actively encouraging a Jungian reading. At times, this becomes a little too on the nose, with the casting of the killer... well, it&apos;s an intriguing choice but ultimately one that will either baffle people or have them slapping their foreheads at its obviousness.\n\nWith one notable exception, the cast acquit themselves reasonably well. The elephant in the room is Adrien Brody, who not only receives top billing but also an executive producer credit, performing uncredited script doctoring duties and making key decisions about the score (including nixing Argento&apos;s regular collaborator Claudio Simonetti). His role is an odd one, and it&apos;s far from the vanity project I expected. Avolfi is not particularly pleasant: he&apos;s distant, smarmy and reckless, and an act he committed in the past further blurs the line between him and the killer. Unfortunately, the specifics of this event, revealed around two-third of the way through the film, sent the audience at the screening I attended into fits of hysterics. More problematic in my mind, however, is Brody&apos;s performance. He seems to be imitating any number of 40s film noir detectives, but comes across as a mumbling buffoon whose reactions and line delivery always seem to be at odds with what&apos;s actually happening. He&apos;s not the first Oscar-winning actor to work with Argento, but he IS one of Argento&apos;s least convincing protagonists.\n\nGiallo is a decent offering from a director whose work of late has been decidedly patchy. While I&apos;m sure the usual battle lines will be drawn, with fans alternating between branding it a return to form and proclaiming it to be proof that he is a has-been, the truth is somewhere in the middle. No, it&apos;s not the next Profondo Rosso, but anyone who expected otherwise would simply be deluding themselves. It&apos;s substantially better than either of Argento&apos;s Masters of Horror outings, a step up from Mother of Tears, and a superior thriller to Do You Like Hitchcock? It&apos;s also more engaging than the overrated Sleepless and about on par with the underrated The Card Player, a film that for me improves with each subsequent viewing. Problems aside, Giallo is surprisingly good fun.",

It would be great if more people could get the opportunity to see it but I doubt a major UK broadcaster will air it either for fear of angering China or because not sensational enough to get monster ratings. It is like &apos;a day in the life of&apos; docu but shot over 3 years. My personal recommendation is that everyone should watch it and take from it what they wish with the hope that the Dalai Lama&apos;s attitude is indeed infectious.",

      "reviewBody": "John Ford&apos;s version of the book, THE LAST HURRAH, is a behind the scenes look at one last election campaign for an aging mayor (Skeffington) of a town whose name is never mentioned in the film. In many ways, the film is a bit cynical as it showed the way that politicians wheel and deal and manipulate--but in this case, always for a good cause. While Skeffington is definitely not above using these questionable tactics, at the same time, he is shown as fundamentally decent and very, very sentimental--with a true love for his constituents. This is a very difficult balancing act for the film--combining gritty realism with sentimentality, but it manages to do so.\n\nIn many ways, this is highly reminiscent of the real life Ford, as he was by many accounts a highly manipulative son of a,.....well, you know what I was going to say. Yet, at the same time, sentimentality abounds in his films like no other film maker. You can see it here in his liberal use of old and almost forgotten supporting stars--such as Eddie Brophy, Frank McHugh and Jane Darwell.\n\nOverall, the film is very interesting and manipulative (in a good way), as you find yourself pulling for Skeffington and feeling his pain as well--even though he is a fictional character AND a politician! The film is well worth seeing and the film is extremely well-acted and directed.",

Meanwhile, Max&apos;s daughter Griselle (KT Stevens) travels to Germany to become an actress. The families are very close and Heinrich and Griselle have future plans to marry. Once Baron von Friesche (Carl Esmond) appears on the scene, Martin goes through a change and is indoctrinated into the Nazi lifestyle. This means rejecting his Jewish friend, Max, and his friend&apos;s daughter Griselle.\n\nThe story develops through letter correspondence between the two friends, Martin and Max. There are several stand out scenes, my favourites being the performance at the theatre when Griselle disobeys the Nazi authorities and the following chase that ensues in order to catch her. The acting is good, particularly from Carl Esmond. You just know that there is a nasty ulterior motive lurking behind everything that he says and does. Once Martin begins to receive coded letters, suspicion is aroused by the German censors and it&apos;s a matter of time before something happens to him... There is a twist at the end.",

She has been sent on what seems to be some sort of futuristic initiation ritual- that is being overseen by a chair, endowed with artificial intelligence, and calling itself her &quot;Grandmother&quot;.\n\nAs this sentient chair begins to tell the little girl a fairy tale- about 3 people whom kill each other to appease a fire spirit- she becomes terrified and flees into hiding.\n\nIt is at this point that the girl&apos;s real grandmother shows up, turns off the chair, sits in it, and continues to tell her a story...as if the whole thing was just the little girl&apos;s imagination running wild, as she listened to her grandmother tell a tall tale about cybernetic overlords mimicking humans, and inserting themselves in their place, as to take over their role and form exploitative relationships with their loved ones.\n\nSo I guess the moral of this little sci-fi/horror stop motion gem is to never trust artificial intelligence. And considering this short film was made in 1962...it is likely way ahead of it&apos;s time.\n\nAt 29 minutes, this little film is both bizarre, experimental, and beautifully made. Another true work of art from the Czech Master of Stop Motion Animation, Jiri Trnka.\n\n7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "5 Card Stud is directed by Henry Hathaway and adapted to screenplay by Marguerite Roberts from a novel written by Ray Gaulden. It stars Robert Mitchum, Dean Martin, Inger Stevens, Roddy McDowall, Katherine Justice, John Anderson, Ruth Springford and Yaphet Kotto. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by Daniel L. Fapp.\n\nRincon, Colorado and when a gambler is caught cheating at poker, the rest of the players administer frontier justice and hang the man. All except one man that is, Van Morgan (Martin), who tried desperately to stop the lynching. When members of the card school from that night start being killed off, it&apos;s clear that somebody is also administering their own brand of retribution justice. Morgan teams up with the new unorthodox preacher in town, Reverend Jonathan Rudd (Mitchum), to try and crack the case.\n\nI don&apos;t think anyone would seriously try to argue that 5 Card Stud is a great movie, but it is a fun picture made by people who knew their way around the dusty plains of the Western genre. Basically a Western take on Agatha Christie&apos;s Ten Little Indians, it&apos;s a whodunit at the core, but surrounded by Western staples as fights, gun-play, murders, barroom shenanigans and thinly veiled prostitution exist during the run time, while the Durango location photography is most pleasant (TCM HD print is gorgeous).\n\nIt&apos;s not short of flaws, mind. Jarre&apos;s musical score is simply odd, I&apos;m not even sure what film genre he thought he was scoring, but it&apos;s about as far removed as being in tune with a film as can be. McDowall as a whiny weasel villain doesn&apos;t work, the costuming is a bit sub-par and the reveal of the perpetrator is revealed too early. Yet film overcomes these problems because being in the company of Mitchum and Martin brings rewards.\n\nDino harks back to his Western glory days in the likes of Rio Bravo, and Mitch gets to parody his Night of the Hunter preacher whilst adding six- shooter charms into the bargain. The girls are short changed by the writing, but both Stevens and Justice grace the picture with their presence, and Kotto enlivens a role that quite easily could have been standard fare. A good time to be had with this Poker Oater © 7/10",

It made me laugh to see a high school princess&apos;s world throw into a frenzy (no, I am not a cynic and don&apos;t hate all high school princesses). I kinda liked it, and it kept me awake at work. I am not suggesting going out and buying it; far from it. But if you get a chance to catch it on TV, and are in the mood for mindless entertainment, watch it. It tries to capitalize on the genre of movies like &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, &quot;Man of the House&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On&quot;. I know that I might be clashing with some of your beliefs about this movie, but your comments made this out a lot worse than it was, which is just a funny teenage movie.",

I thought Brandon Fraser was cast in a role that he normally doesn&apos;t play but that didn&apos;t take away from the movie if anything it added to it. He definitely had a presence on the screen as did Scott. The characters were also justified in their actions. Don&apos;t get me wrong there were flaws in the film I just felt that they were minimal. I went in expecting to watch a film that wasn&apos;t going to be very good and I ended up seeing something that I though was entertaining and interesting. The main character was not Brazil, there are movies where the city is the main character and the actors are there to move it along. This was very much character based film.",

A case comes up which pitches them against each other. To make matters worse she resents her father for cheating on his wife (her mother) in the past. When they start butting heads over the case all hell breaks loose.\n\nGreat legal drama with Hackman and Mastrantonio giving incredible performances in the leads. Either being politely legal to each other in the courtroom or tearing into each other in private they&apos;re great. I&apos;m no lawyer but the film seems to follow legal procedures and rules pretty accurately (unlike some legal dramas that completely ignore most of the them). Even better it doesn&apos;t dumb down the dialogue and treat the audience like a bunch of idiots. It&apos;s well-written, thought-provoking and brings up some very good legal and ethical questions. Sometimes it&apos;s a little too slow and occasionally people seem to be giving speeches rather than talking but it still works all around. Also Colin Friels, Larry (Laurence) Fishburne, Donald Moffat and Jan Rubes give strong performances in supporting roles. This came and went pretty quickly in 1991 (probably because it had the most boring posters I&apos;ve ever seen advertising it) but it&apos;s a good legal thriller that&apos;s worth catching. I give it an 8.",

      "reviewBody": "...not quite , but his performance in Scrooged isnt far behind omnipitancy. With exception to Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day, this is probably one of his most hilarious performances to date. In this re-working of Dickens &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; , Murray plays Frank Cross, a tight fisted,selfish Network Executive who, as christmas rapidly approaches, finds himself needing to hasten up proceedings on his networks live Christmas Carol show, which is airing on Christmas eve. From the very start of the film, we are treated to how unkind and selfish, Murrays character really is, yet we still cant bring ourselves to hate him.....even when he suggests to a prop man that he should STAPLE little plastic antlers to the heads of door-mice.\n\nDue to a very creepy encounter with his dead boss, Cross is warned that he will be visited by 3 ghosts, and so the story takes off, as he meets 3 very unusual ghosts with even weirder traits, such as the ghost of christmas present, who likes to randomly beat Cross up, every time he shows no heart. Best of all is the NOO YAWK talkin taxi driver, who i feel almost steals the show from Murray ....which is one of the hardest things in the world!!!\n\nRunning throughout the film, is, ...sadly, a rather weak sub plot of Cross and his ex-lover, which , i love for all the wrong reasons.....but sadly, to people who have never seen the film, might find a bit tedious.\n\nBut of course....its Murray who comes away from this looking cool, as , even though he has experienced some genuinely scary things ( the halucination of a waiter on fire is still creepy), we lap up his dead pan reactions to it all!!"

Shogun and daimyo are almost all women. The film has a lot of potential in its history, but fails to develop; shows slightly: Love in its different facets. Power and loneliness go side by side. The powerful people that turns a blind eye to the reality of most. Absolute power, with the abuse of that power taking naif or bad decisions that affects the life of millions. No matter the social class, we could all live the same sorrows and loneliness (or the good times) -The director could have made a great drama, however it is only effective half hour of the film (at 3/4 towards the end); the remain part is just a fill. Interestingly, as it can be seen the role of women as objects but this time played by men. true locations in general (I was in the majority) but adding by computer, other buildings. The camera movements are too &quot;Hollywoodesque&quot; and in some cases the director use and abuses the same technique. Costume and staging are well done as usual in these films.",

But this is definitely not his best. Pls go hear &quot;dil se&quot; and u&apos;ll know what i am talking about! Compare this movie to previous Oscar winners like American beauty, and well, u&apos;ll know wat i mean. \n\nVerdict : To everyone who has still not seen the film, It&apos;s definitely a one time watch. Good music,Good story and Good (kind hearted if i may add) cast and crew. But i request you to watch it with an open mind. And by the way, Mumbai is not just a &quot;slum area&quot;. :-)",

      "reviewBody": "Cafe Electric is one of many German silent films Marlene Dietrich played in before her &quot;discovery&quot; by Josef von Sternberg in which she was cast as Lola Lola in the Blue Angel and began her American film career. The early scenes of Berlin in the 1920&apos;s are notable for a glimpse of the times and that they were shot on location. The plot is moralistic but not without intrigue. It&apos;s also very interesting to see a young Dietrich before the meticulous attention to her glamorous look in American films. I searched for many years to find any copy of Cafe Electric as a die-hard fan who wanted to see everything she was ever in before finding a DVD available from forgottenfilms.net. There are no special features or even scene selection, but the musical score and English titles are very good. Cafe Electric is a must see for those interested in silent films of the &apos;20&apos;s and especially Marlene Dietrich fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Julius Caesar is a fragment of Roman history, which saw the rise and fall of titans such as Caesar and Mark Antony. The play is a continuation of a magnitude of events, wars and happenings that have already occurred and have resulted in the might of a man called Julius Caesar. Our knowledge about Caesar&apos;s past is faint and can be only updated through Caesar&apos;s current state and from the characters surrounding him. We sense mercilessness, pomposity, boastfulness, egoism in him through his statements and those made by others such as Cassius but we cannot deny his intelligence, his astuteness and experience also through the statements made by him, Mark Antony, Brutus. Our sparse knowledge about Caesar and certain contradictory attributes regarding him can only construe that he was human, imperfect not inept. The other characters such as Brutus, Mark Antony, Cassius, and Casca were all humans, struggling to fulfill their personal ambitions in a variegated world. Perhaps that&apos;s why Julius Caesar the play has none of the high-mindedness of some other plays, and that also makes the narrative a breezy read unlike Hamlet and The Tempest. I think the better play would be Hamlet, because it more organic and definitive, but the more accessible play would certainly be Julius Caesar. When we look at the current anarchy and revolutions in many countries, we think of Julius Caesar and the concept of use and abuse of power and its consequences. \n\nJulius Caesar&apos;s characters are not as complex as those in Hamlet and their motives are not as well defined either. After watching the movie twice, reading the play and watching the film again, over two days, I still could not find clarity in Cassius&apos; agenda. He certainly was incendiary in persuading the Senators to persecute Caesar, and he also paltered with Brutus by turning a blind eye to bribery and possibly having itching palm himself. In a play so short, his ambitions could not be well articulated, and I don&apos;t criticize Shakespeare here, since one needs a 1400 page epic like Leo Tolstoy&apos;s War and Peace to fully flesh out characters (even then Tolstoy&apos;s characters kept evolving with changing times). But we are better told about Brutus, who seems to be too moralistic to adopt practicality that Cassius possessed. When he plunged the dagger into Caesar, his soul was not at rest but rather disquiet at the failure of trust on his part. &quot;Et tu Brute? Then fall Caesar&quot; utters Caesar before succumbing to the stab wounds, and these words do not affect Brutus immediately because the deed is done and he has to face the music, but slowly he realizes that he too face doom in the near future. Mark Antony does not come into prominence till Caesar&apos;s death and has a game changing speech that shall put him on the throne and cause the Senators to scurry away. Being one of Caesar&apos;s most trusted confidantes, Antony must&apos;ve certainly inherited some qualities from him, and that may be how he sways an agitated crowd against Brutus by targeting their emotions. The women, namely Calpurnia and Portia, act as possible negators of Caesar&apos;s fall, and their main purpose it to bring some tension to the play as they unknowingly try to prevent the chain of events. The soothsayer and Artemidorus are also for the same purpose.\n\nComing to the movie at last, I commend Joseph L. Mankiewicz for (i) giving much freedom to the actors who were well versed with Shakespeare (ii) leaving out redundant portion such as Antony telling a how he would try to extract revenge on Brutus and (iii) keeping the production minimalistic unlike some gaudy historical works (not of Shakespeare) such as 1963&apos;s blinding Cleopatra or 1979&apos;s execrable Caligula. Acting-wise, I was never certain about which of the three performances – Brando&apos;s, Mason&apos;s and Gielgud&apos;s – was the best. On my first viewing, I was unimpressed and slightly irritated by Brando, but I realized it took time to get used to sharp tonal quality. Mason was thoroughly consistent in making Brutus a heroic character, and I note here that Brutus&apos; momentary disgust, shock and shame at witnessing Caesar&apos;s attack is the only time I felt a chill down my spine looking at the rush of emotions on Mason&apos;s face. Gielgud has a mellifluous voice and his enunciation was noteworthy. By the third viewing, Brando grew on me and I began realizing the potential of his performance. He role is risky since the monologue he utters is of prime importance, and I admired the rhetoric that he put in his speech to make the same lines &quot;But Caesar was ambitious. And Brutus is an honorable man&quot; sound assertive, affirmative, dispassionate, questionable, accusatory and then sarcastic each time uttered. Even when he points out the stab wounds casted by the Senators, his tearing voice sounds like tearing of flesh by the stab wounds inflicted. I yet felt he was not the leading man, but a great supporting character. Gielgud now seemed slightly theatrical and mechanical at times yet very competent. Therefore, I thought Mason was the leading man worthy of an Oscar nomination for his touching portrayal of the misfortunate Brutus. Edmond O&apos;Brien was good, and Deborah Kerr did her job, though she could have created more personality to her character- who is supposedly a pale, neglected and distraught wife who constantly endeavors to bear her husband&apos;s doubts that he keeps hiding from her. The camp, goof and schlock comes with Louis Calhern and mainly, Greer Garson, who did a magnificent job in Mrs. Miniver but sounds over-the-top and mawkish. Fortunately, she still can&apos;t beat Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s Cleopatra who gave an orgasm-like reaction at Caesar&apos;s death and had murdered every emotion you could think of. The supporting cast from the beginning to the end was very complimentary for the movie.\n\nAll in all, a fine transition of a Shakespearean play to the big screen. \n\nMy Rating: 8.3 out of 10",

A great, and greatly tragic story that is told without too much bias when it would be easy to let emotion cloud the truth. A must watch. The film not only captures the story of Benjamin Marshall, but also of a city along with its inherent struggles, and a terrible felling of what if? I don&apos;t want to take away from the film, but i will say not knowing the story before i watched the film took me on an emotional journey which at the end left me asking questions and feeling overwhelmed, and any documentary the can take you on that journey is worth a watch at least.

      "reviewBody": "The film talks a hold-up to Turkish museum carried out by a motley group : Melina Mercouri , Maximiliam Schell , Jess Hahn , Gilles Segal . They are pursued by a chief policeman who blackmails to Peter Ustinov to get undercover in the band.\n\nFrom the beginning until ending the good mood and humor is continued . The plot is very amusing and the final has got an extraordinary surprise . In the movie there are comedy , action , tongue-in-cheek , giggles and results to be very bemusing . The highlight and great climax , of course , is the heist which is developed with imposing tension and intrigue . The robbing has been imitated thousand times in European films as well as American movies (Mission impossible). This picture along with ¨Rififi¨(also by Jules Dassin) created during the 60s and forward an authentic genre . \n\nThe title of the film refers to the Topkapi palace built by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1459, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire , the Ottoman sultans made their main residence in the Topkapi palace for 400 years , it became a museum in 1924 . The motion picture attained a lot of success and originated copies , rip offs and awful imitations . Actors&apos;s interpretation are excellent , Peter Ustinov is magnificent and Robert Morley is top-notch specially . Manos Hadjidakis&apos; musical score is cheerful and enjoyable . The picture was very well directed by Jules Dassin (Melina Mercouri&apos;s husband).\n\nThe yarn will appeal to comedy enthusiasts and robbery genre fans . Rating : Above average . Well worth watching .",

Mainly in its first part ,the cinematography shows an almost disturbing landscape and the screenplay hints at Breton legends ,witches, sprites ,and dolmens (including a rather saucy song about them).Enter ETs -who may or may not be Martians -(one of them played by Amanda Lear!)- .These space people have cat eyes and a disintegrating pistol;and when they touch a woman &apos;s lips with their magic kiss...\n\nJean Rochefort is a reliable actor,Macha Méril is charming,and the story not too derivative ;if you are not asking too much ,you can have a look ."

Cobra despises crime and journalists, plays rough and does not forgive anyone.\n\nToday, it is almost impossible to make a film like this, with such a great character and a vicious action full of bloodshed. The film is extremely entertaining, well directed, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nThe plot is simple, the villains are killing people and Cobra will stop them with all the means at his disposal, and that of course includes a large amount of extreme violence and bloodshed.\n\nThe soundtrack is a memorable, complete product of that time and fits the film perfectly.\n\nThe film looks like an interesting combination of action film with elements of slasher horror, although Cobra can definitely not be classified as horror, but as an action film that provides the viewer with a great amount of entertainment.\n\nAn underrated film that has definitely achieved cult status.",

      "reviewBody": "Full review on my blog max4movies: Solyaris is the first adaptation of Stanislaw Lem&apos;s novel of the same name. It&apos;s a two-part made for television movie about a scientist who encounters his dead wife on a space station orbiting a sentient planet. The movie heavily focuses on philosophic discussions about morality and stays more closely to the original novel than the other cinematic adaptations by Tarkowski and Soderbergh. Technically, the movie is dated and the generally low production values and the minimalistic setting will turn off some viewers. In addition, the slow pacing of the frequent dialogue scenes and the sometimes middling performances don&apos;t necessarily make the movie entertaining. However, the plot is intriguing and faithful to the source material, some dialogues are clever, and the black and white cinematography also make this science fiction drama atmospheric.",

Not only did I enjoy the film even more than the first viewing, but I immediately rewatched it via the Director&apos;s Commentary. The commentary makes you love the film exponentially more if only because it&apos;s done in a unique way: Cory McAbee narrates at a live screening, taking questions from the audience. McAbee is uniquely eloquent in his commentary. I&apos;ve heard many commentaries that simply leave me numb, praying for narcolepsy to strike. Instead, the heart and mind of a true Renaissance man were revealed, imbuing the film (and the music) with new life (just when you thought you couldn&apos;t love a film more). There are some perfect cinematic scenes in this film. I watch literally hundreds of films a year and it&apos;s rare that I&apos;m surprised by some narrative trope but to my joy, Hey Boy! is there to give me new faith in cinema. However impressed I was with Cory McAbee before, now I&apos;m awestruck. And it&apos;s always a treat to hear Brian Eno&apos;s name a few times in a commentary. Wow. Congratulations.",

My first choice for the time slot was full, and this would end in time to see my next screening, so I grabbed a seat as the lights went down.\n\nA very pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed this movie, walking into it with out the slightest idea what it was about.\n\nWhile the premise may not have been 100% original (man helps man get back the girl... but falls for her himself), I thought it was very well done. We should all wish to have friends as dedicated as Antoine, and we can all relate to Louis at some point in our lives.\n\nWhile the movie may not have been hysterical, I found myself smiling or laughing most of the time. The end result wasn&apos;t completely unexpected, yet how they got there was a surprise to me, with the last gag being a nice touch.\n\nDefinitely recommend this film. Not one you&apos;ll discus what it means for hours, but one you should enjoy while you are there.",

But I definitely don&apos;t regret seeing it.\n\nThe plot was, unfortunately, the weakest part of the movie. It was just so Saturday-morning-cartoonish (complete with evil twins, magic diamonds and walking skeletons) that anyone in the cinema over the age of nine is unlikely to be interested. But anyone under that age will be delighted from start to finish.\n\nIt&apos;s the cast and music that really did it for me. Robbie Williams, despite his complete lack of experience as an actor, pulls off his role as Dougal with natural skill and emotion, which is pleasantly surprising. Jim Broadbent and Joanna Lumley seem to have great fun in their roles (as Brian the snail and Ermintrude the cow respectively) and Bill Nighy, well, lets just say there&apos;s no one else in the world who could&apos;ve done Dylan the drug-addled bunny like he did (&quot;no way man! I&apos;m in, like, a higher state of unconsciousness...&quot;). Kylie Minogue did well enough, but she only has about three lines. Tom Baker and Sir Ian Mackellen also seemed to enjoy giving very camp performances as the arch rival jack-in-the-boxes Zebedee and Zeebad (though Sir Ian sounded a little too much like Gandalf). The music, which seems to include vocal performances from Kylie and Robbie, is fantastic and well above average for a kids film today. If you&apos;ve seen the film, I think you&apos;ll agree the soundtrack is a must-buy! But still, it&apos;s not all great. The plot is full of gaping holes, and while it mostly works with a very young audience in mind, the jokes aimed at adults are not laugh-out-loud funny, they just raise a knowing smile. There are some rather strange movie references too. It features references to Pulp Fiction, LoTR, and The Matrix (courtesy of some unexpected kung-fu fighting on Dylan&apos;s part) and I&apos;ll be damned if I saw a Dragon Ball Z reference in there! (Watch the scene where Zebad fights Zebedee for the first time - then again maybe it was just cheesy...) I never saw enough of the original 5 minute episodes to be a fan, but really, it seems very different from the original, so old-time fans may be disappointed, or maybe they&apos;ll appreciate seeing their old favourites in some new action-packed situations. It&apos;s up to them.\n\nYes, it falls flat in MANY places, but it&apos;s also got a childish, endearing charm that may make you wish you were seven again.",

Since the horror genre was very popular in the late ninety&apos;s (consider the scream series) they tried to copy the concept and changed the setting to a small village in the austrian alpes. First of all I think it&apos;s much too late for this. There are too much better horror movies. Everything in this movie is stereotype, a lonely village, some stupid cops etc... It&apos;s a bit boring, nothing new. It&apos;s just a film which was not necessary. The only plus is the good playing of the main actress (the nice and cute Valerie Niehaus) and that the film does not take itself too serious. Some funny scenes. And a unusual ending.

      "reviewBody": "A &quot;lost&quot; film for some years, this early Santo film recently surfaced on home video. Produced in 1961, it is one of several films in which the primary stars were Fernando Casanova, Ana Bertha Lepe and Beto el Boticario (playing a detective, his reporter girlfriend, and the former&apos;s amusing assistant). Santo figures in these films, but more as a plot device who&apos;s called in midway through the action, to put a stop to the evil du jour. He simply appears as needed, battles things to a conclusion, and then vanishes with no comment. His appearance in HOTEL OF DEATH is no different.\n\nTourists visiting the Mexican pyramids, and staying at a nearby hotel, are alarmed at the first of a series of murders. A Columbian tourist&apos;s body floats past a couple enjoying the night air. A resultant search turns up no clues....or a corpse, though the woman remains missing.\n\nFernando and his assistant are assigned to the case by their chief, as the hotel owner is a personal friend. Arriving on the scene, they find that things are clearly not normal. A bearded drifter is blackmailing a visitor, and two other tourists are found dead -- one in a bathtub and another in the hotel&apos;s pool.  Worse, Fernando&apos;s annoying girlfriend is on the scene.\n\nAfter some snooping around, Fernando is knocked unconscious when he confronts an intruder menacing his fiancee. While he&apos;s unconscious, she uses his wristwatch/radio to summon Santo. Santo is on his way to a wrestling match, but he agrees to come to the hotel as soon as he can.\n\nArriving some time later, Santo begins his investigation, revealing that a bearded no-good is blackmailing one of the other guests. This comes to a head in a nicely filmed sequence in which Santo stalks the gun-wielding thug through the hotel&apos;s gardens, in near-darkness.\n\nAn attempt to avoid further trouble by placing all the women tourists into one bungalow backfires. The reporter is captured.\n\nWe now learn that a small band of men, led by a professor (Wally Barron), are digging beneath the hotel. They hope to locate a legendary Aztec treasure.\n\nA noted expert on the ruins, the scientist has been openly conducting an investigation, while secretly tunneling into the ruins from below the hotel during the night hours. As a diversion, he&apos;s captured various tourists and feigned their deaths by use of wax dummies. Now, however, he decides everyone will have to die.\n\nVirtually everyone ends up captured at this point including, apparently, Santo. This turns out to be a trick, however (it&apos;s Fernando&apos;s assistant), and the real Santo routs the crooks. He pursues the professor through narrow tunnels until the schemer falls into the concealed chamber where the treasure had been hidden centuries before. Confronted with the fortune, the criminal goes mad.\n\nAdmittedly sheer melodrama, the film has its interesting points. Santo has an energetic match with real-life wrestler Black Shadow. Quite a bit also happened within the hotel&apos;s attractive confines. The black-and-white photography also fits the mood, as does the jazz number performed by the entertainers at the party which precedes the discovery of the first &quot;body.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "With &quot;The Perfume&quot; it&apos;s like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it&apos;s horrible - if the critics hate it, it&apos;s brilliant.\n\nI had the chance to watch a preview of &quot;The Perfume&quot; tonight and I was very surprised: this movie is really good! Okay, it can&apos;t actually make you smell all the scents and odours, but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn&apos;t have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.\n\nAlthough much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It&apos;s a very good adaption of Süskind&apos;s novel, sticking to the original plot concerning the major events, leaving away unnecessary subplots (although it&apos;s a pity that funny &quot;lethal gas&quot;-plot was cut out!) and shortening long passages. The result is well-constructed movie that is worth seeing.\n\nThe actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Like in the novel, Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw&apos;s half-crazy, scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.\n\nThe only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn&apos;t show much violence, which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel - in the movie you hardly see what happens.\n\nHowever, it&apos;s really a thrilling story visualized excellently - go to the movies and watch &quot;The Perfume&quot;! You won&apos;t be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "The film opens with a large, visibly injured, and obviously fake fish talking directly to the audience. Nearby a man is cutting up fish. The talking fish says that his life in nearly over, and he would like to tell a &quot;pretty&quot; story with his last breaths. Then we cut to a beautiful woman, in a doctor&apos;s office. We soon figure out that she is having an abortion. As we see the fetal matter being incinerated and her leaving the building, the grossly perky song &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; begins to play. Okay... This is obviously not going to be your normal film.\n\nThe woman is named Bibiane (Marie-Josée Croze), and she turns out to be the main character. Perhaps related to the abortion, it soon becomes clear that her life is not going too well right now. Not long into the film she is removed from her position in the family business, a chain of upscale clothing stores, by her brother (although at first I thought he was her estranged or ex-husband).\n\nMost reviews or plot summaries go into more detail about events that occur in the middle and end of the film, but I&apos;ll keep it to that. There are some rather unlikely coincidences along the way, in case that sort of thing bothers you. And there is a distinct water theme, which is not surprising given the title. I would classify the film as primarily a drama, since the laughs are mostly at surprising events rather than strictly funny ones, and because the film kept me feeling slightly uncomfortable throughout.\n\nMarie-Josée Croze is very good here. The cinematography is excellent, with at least one shot that took my breath away. The story and the direction, both by Denis Villeneuve, on the other hand, are somewhat suspect. Besides the aforementioned coincidences, several scenes are juxtaposed in a seemly random manner, and you can&apos;t figure them out until later if then. Now this could just be a mechanism to get you to think, and in the wake of Memento (which came out at about the same time as this film) one is becoming used to the idea of the film structure mirroring the main character&apos;s thought processes. I&apos;m not sure I completely buy this argument, but I&apos;ll give it a little leeway.\n\nThis film won the best picture, direction, cinematography, screenplay, and actress awards in Canada at their equivalent of the Academy Awards, but it is only just now getting to the United States, where it is expected to play for a very short time. In the San Jose, CA area it is expected on May 17th.\n\nSeen on 5/5/2002 at the Camera Cinema Club in San Jose, CA."

      "reviewBody": "Often forgotten after it&apos;s release because it was critized as being a takeoff of Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s then current Broadway musical version of the same title. Actually, Dwight H. Little&apos;s film version isn&apos;t bad and Duke Sandefur&apos;s script actually has more originality than some of the earlier versions. Robert Englund is probably the most terrifying phantom yet, he probably can&apos;t pull it off like Lon Chaney did in the 1925 film version, but he certainly did a terrific job at playing a more darker and scarier phantom. Jill Schoelen also did a pretty amazing job playing Christine, as she is taken from present day New York to 1881 London were she is the star of the opera and stalked by the phantom and he kills anyone who gets in his way. My favorite death scene is probably were the phantom takes on three thieves and also kills an opera critic in a sauna. In addition to the originality, the phantom is cursed by the devil and his face mutilated in a Faust tradition. He is then forced to sew on pieces of skin to save his face. The production is luxurious and the costumes are authentic. But the most greatest thing about this 1989 remake is the music. This is probably the best music I have ever heard for any Phantom film. It&apos;s more malvolent and suspensful and also at the same time magicial. Misha Segal certainly did an amazing job at creating a difficult score, and it&apos;s a shame that I don&apos;t hear his music in today&apos;s films. I guess the film could have been a little better if it had a little less gore and a good falling chandlier scene, but even though this is the only Phantom film without a chandlier it was still an amazing picture. Also look for Saturday Night Live star Molly Shannon in a small role in the New York City sequences."

      "reviewBody": "Tomb Of The Werewolf was more like a college porno film, within the first ten minute there is already a woman feeling up another girl, now that&apos;s not the bad part. The bad part was, is that the movie was terribly done, bad actors, not a bad plot but the way they made Paul Naschy become a werewolf was ridiculous. I mean come on, a silver cross can only kill the werewolf? He looked more like a guy who hadn&apos;t shaved in a while much less than a werewolf. But if you are a person who likes movies with a terrible plot, horrific actors, awful special effects and it has the makings of a bad college porn flick, then you will certainly love Tomb Of The Werewolf.",

With great acting, scenery, score and editing you could tell it was a well made film from the off.\n\nWith quite a long running time i was expecting some overly long scenes, but it never felt drawn out and the pace was pretty spot on i never clocked watched once! And this is coming from someone that rarely views films longer than two hours and i watched the full 2h 25m original cut of the film.\n\nThe only gripe i guess in this version is knowing a couple of the characters (who i won&apos;t name) made it to the end starting with a retrospective beginning, i haven&apos;t seen the shorter version but i&apos;m guessing this start was changed for the overseas cut?\n\nTo sum up, its well worth a watch even if you think the type of film is not for you.",

We see some troubled kids; what we (and he) can&apos;t tell is what exactly they would be like if they weren&apos;t on anti-depressants. What&apos;s more striking is the pervasiveness of the language of modern therapy, among doctors, parents and patients alike: there&apos;s something slightly scary about hearing an eight year old child describing their own behaviour as &quot;inappropriate&quot;. I can appreciate that a child&apos;s behaviour can be (self-) destructive, harmful or difficult - but surely it&apos;s a curse of adulthood that certain behaviours are considered appropriate, or not. The programme left me disturbed, but not in the expected way; I have no idea if these particular children are well-served by their medical regimen, but slightly concerned at the demands the world places on both healthy and disturbed children.",

      "reviewBody": "Every bit of acclaim that Rosemary&apos;s Baby has earned is totally deserved. The Dakota, located at 72nd and Central Park West, is the perfect setting for the demonic events; all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere, serving as a dark fairy-tale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly, opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.\n\nThe acting is fantastic, particularly Mia Farrow, who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fine-boned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam, and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon, a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. She&apos;s scary because we know her--a batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.\n\nUnnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving, eerie, and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key, since a more explicit treatment would&apos;ve spoiled everything. As the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels: Curiosity, then vague suspicion, then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times, the movie retains its dignity, from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV, this picture can chill you to the bone. The best big-budget horror movie of all time."

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t get me wrong; this movie is worth at least one viewing. James Woods - as usual - is great in his performance, and the supporting cast is good, too.\n\nKiller: A Journal of Murder is based on Thomas Gaddis&apos; and James O. Long&apos;s fascinating 1970 book of the same name. It contains many of the letters Panzram wrote to Henry Lesser (who was a Washington, D.C. jail guard, not a prison guard at Leavenworth) while he was on death row in Leavenworth.\n\nWhile it is a common practice for films to take artistic liberties when dealing with true stories, this film went a bit far in trying to make Carl Panzram (Woods) into a sympathetic character. True, Carl Panzram was the product of a barbaric prison system, but he stands out in history as one of the few arch-criminals who did not want sympathy, something this film ignores.\n\nThis was a film that needed to be made, but unfortunately, the story was mishandled in a maudlin attempt to get the viewer to care about one of the most reprehensible human beings who ever lived. If they had wanted to make a biographical film to convey their particular message, the people responsible for this movie should have made a film about Caryl Chessman, a criminal more eloquent, tragic and - most importantly - far more sympathetic than Carl Panzram."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Rob Roy&quot; was made at a time when the success of &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; had revived interest in the traditional Western, and director Michael Caton-Jones, himself a Scot, has admitted that the film is essentially a disguised Western. It transfers what could be a classic Western plot from 19thcentury America to early 18th century Scotland, with claymores standing in for six-shooters. The hero is even a cattle drover or, as Americans would put it, a cowboy. That hero, Robert Roy MacGregor, was a real historical figure who also features in Walter Scott&apos;s novel of the same name. (&quot;Roy&quot; in this context was a nickname, derived from Gaelic, meaning &quot;red-haired&quot;, but here it is treated as a second Christian name; Liam Neeson does not play the part in a red wig).\n\nThe film does not follow Scott&apos;s plot but is loosely based on the facts of the real MacGregor&apos;s life. In 1713 Rob Roy, a clan chief in the Scottish Highlands, is financially ruined by the machinations of the unscrupulous Marquess of Montrose and his villainous protégé Archibald Cunningham. (Cunningham is fictitious but Montrose was another real person). Cunningham has been described as an &quot;aristocrat&quot;, but this is not really accurate because, for all his dandyish appearance and foppish mannerisms, he is really the illegitimate son of a prostitute and does not know who his real father is. Montrose has probably taken him under his wing because he recognises in him a kindred spirit, equally unscrupulous and even more ruthless.\n\nWhen Rob Roy is unable to repay the money he owes, Montrose has him declared an outlaw, seizes his land and slaughters his cattle; Cunningham brutally rapes his wife Mary. Rob Roy and his followers, who have fled into hiding in the mountains, wage a guerrilla campaign of revenge against Montrose, stealing his cattle and other property.\n\nThis was one of two historical films with a Scottish setting made in 1995, the other being the Oscar-winning &quot;Braveheart&quot;. The two films share one feature, namely a somewhat disapproving attitude towards homosexuality, which today makes them look rather old-fashioned, even though they were only made around twenty years ago. In &quot;Braveheart&quot; the future King Edward II is portrayed as stereotypically weak and effeminate, whereas here the treacherous Cunningham is gratuitously made bisexual, a lover of boys as well as women, a piece of characterisation which the scriptwriter presumably thought would make him seem all the nastier.\n\nThat said, I must say that I found &quot;Rob Roy&quot; a considerably better film than the much-hyped &quot;Braveheart&quot;. Mel Gibson&apos;s epic is a reasonably entertaining adventure story, but it does have its faults, quite apart from its many historical inaccuracies. It is overlong by at least half an hour, and the acting is of a variable standard. In &quot;Rob Roy&quot; Caton-Jones paces the action in a more satisfactory way than does Gibson, and the acting is also a lot better. I was not too keen on Tim Roth&apos;s performance, as I felt that he made Cunningham a bit too much of a one-dimensional pantomime villain, but there are three outstanding contributions from Neeson, Jessica Lange and John Hurt.\n\nDespite his status as Chief of Clan MacGregor, Rob Roy lives simply in a modest house which contrasts sharply with Montrose&apos;s elaborate palace. The code by which he lives is equally simple- honesty, loyalty and honour; when Montrose offers to forgive Rob&apos;s debt if Rob will testify falsely against one of Montrose&apos;s enemies, Rob indignantly refuses. Hurt&apos;s Montrose appears to be an elegant, courtly gentleman, but his surface sophistication hides a ruthless opportunist who will use other people in any way he can, provided it is to his advantage. Mary MacGregor could simply have come across as a hapless victim and little else, but Lange (who copes well with the Scottish accent) instead plays her as a tough, independent-minded woman who frequently disagrees with her husband even though she loves him dearly.\n\nThe sword-fighting scenes, particularly the climactic duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham, were well handled; the film-makers clearly realised that the Scottish claymore was a heavier weapon than the duelling rapiers more commonly seen on screen and called for a different fighting style. Overall this is a splendid, stirring historical yarn on the themes of honour, love and loyalty. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "The third film in George A. Romero&apos;s immensely popular &quot;Living Dead&quot; trilogy is by far the bleakest and most complex film the director has ever worked on. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; received a lot of negative press upon its release in 1985 - people picked apart unsavory characters, OVER-acting from a no-name cast, and outlandishly gory special effects that only Tom Savini himself could be proud of.\n\nBut none of this makes it a bad experience really, does it? I don&apos;t think so. For the reason that I usually detest zombie flicks, I have worked up a fondness for the works of Romero and over the last two weeks have separately watched each film in his trilogy.\n\n&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) virtually defined a new genre of horror movie-making and basically set the standards for the many zombie flicks that would follow in its footsteps. Next up to bat was the most praised film in the trilogy - &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978) - which was more of an action film than a horror movie and was nothing short of epic. Then came &quot;Day&quot; in 1985, which got the tongue-lashing that I described earlier.\n\nHowever those that did like it, praised the Savini effects, its complex, plot-driven characters, and satire. While &quot;Day&quot; is certainly a step down from &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Dawn,&quot; &quot;Day&quot; is more of a claustrophobic horror movie and that allows it to stand on its own as a fitting end to Romero&apos;s trilogy. It&apos;s more in sync with the tension of &quot;Night&quot; than it is with the adrenalin-laced action, zombie-slaughterfest that was &quot;Dawn.&quot;\n\nA team of civilian scientists and a loose army unit clash with each other&apos;s motives after they have taken shelter at an underground military base from the hordes of living dead that storm the surface above. The civilian scientists aren&apos;t seeking to eradicate the zombies like the soldiers are hell-bent on doing, but are instead trying to get to the bottom of what is causing them to be what they are.\n\nIn doing so, they need live zombie specimens, which are held captive in a maze of dark underground tunnels where they&apos;re corralled like cattle. We later get what is one of the most profound and moving experiences in the entire trilogy with &quot;Day,&quot; when we see one zombie, nicknamed &quot;Bub&quot; by one particularly eccentric scientist, who eventually learns what it means to be &quot;alive,&quot; so to speak.\n\n&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; obviously isn&apos;t a perfect movie, but is more or less a fitting conclusion to one of the most daring film trilogies in the horror genre. It may be best to not watch &quot;Day&quot; thinking it&apos;ll be anything like &quot;Dawn&quot; just because it has military men blasting away mercilessly at the living dead. Zombie slaughter is few and far between and much of the first hour of the film is clashing dialogue between the characters.\n\nThe darkest day in the world - &quot;Day of the Dead.&quot;\n\n9/10",

His movie is one of the weirdest pieces of celluloid I&apos;ve encountered this year. The movie&apos;s structure vaguely resembles &quot;Monthy Python&apos;s meaning of life&quot;, but it is a bit more stringent and was produced with a much lower budget. It is a funny movie, however, the humor is kind of drastic, cynical, blasphemic, disgusting, taboo- breaking; and it is not intended to make you roll on the floor laughing. However, there are some pearls hidden in the dirt. Some camera shots demonstrate an incredibly sensitive view for composition, color and timing. For instance, ordinary street pavement and standardized suburban houses look magical and slightly scary, respectively. Zimmerscheid has also composed the music which is unbelievable because it is so diverse, covering groovy drum solo, string quartet, piano... . This originary mix of primitivity and sensitiviy make this a truly post-modern piece of art."

Having escaped from high-security prison Itty now looks for revenge being confronted by young police officer (Santi). Will occult powers bring any luck to those with good and bad intentions?\n\nWhat pleased me most about this movie is that creators relied more on imagery, rather than dialogs, surprising me with how little has been spoken having told so lot.\n\nAs for the imagery itself it was full of style and sometimes stunning (in a way of Re-Cycle and Eye), being well infused with cultural motives (ceremonies, temple sequences) and genuine nuances (lunch scenes, hierarchical relations).\n\nI always praise the sense of proportion and Necromancer didn&apos;t disappoint me. No excessive gore, and effects were used right to the necessary. In fact, in this aspect it was quite an opposite to the Arts of Devil already mentioned here.\n\nIn contrary to what have been written here the story wasn&apos;t confusing or demanding a deep Asian background, it was even not without some dramatic value (how far one can get with good intentions), and a good thought-provoking twist. Again nothing in common with the Arts of Devil, which was nothing more to me but an exotic Hostel-like slasher.\n\nActing and obviously directing were strong, nothing to complain. Even soundtrack was pleasing all the way with a relevant new-age-like background.\n\nMaking a decent horror movie about black magic is tricky by definition so I was eager to see the final stand. Surprisingly, although not without some minor reservations Necromancer passed even this test having delivered quite an impressive battle scene and not so easy to guess finale.\n\nSo, although Necromancer doesn&apos;t offer anything new in horror-making and doesn&apos;t scare much it nevertheless delivers as a high-quality exotic thriller with some stunning imagery and involving story. It&apos;s well worth seeing.",

I&apos;m surprised to find that some Kieslowski fans, especially those who appreciate the colors trilogy, don&apos;t understand &quot;Blind Chance.&quot;  In my opinion, &quot;Blind Chance&quot; encapsulates many of the ideas and themes Kieslowski later explored in more detail.\n\nHowever, &quot;Blind Chance&quot; is, ultimately, a political film.  Although Kieslowski never really considered himself a political film-maker (compared to some of his contemporaries), &quot;Blind Chance&quot; is very much driven by political undercurrents and the outcome of each scenario has a decidedly political aspect.  That said, the film transcends the immediate political situation in Poland as well and elevates &quot;politics&quot; to a much broader all-encompassing level.  It is really not Polish politics that concern Kieslowski here, but the human being&apos;s capacity for taking action.  Each scenario presents a possible course of action (or non-action).  Kieslowski doesn&apos;t seem to endorse one course over the other, but makes a much broader statement about the need to take action, to believe in something, and to fight for something.  What one is fighting for, what one believes in, ultimately isn&apos;t as important as the fight itself.\n\nA brilliant and highly thought-provoking film.  In my opinion, one of Kieslowski&apos;s most accomplished and densely-packed works.  I hope that anyone who didn&apos;t appreciate &quot;Blind Chance&quot; will give it another chance (I&apos;ve watched it at least ten times).  It is not the most accessible film, but the pay-off is worth the effort."

From a well-paced plotline in Hong-kong, the scenes in Singapore seemed really rushed...\n\nPhyllis Quek is stunning, emoting without overacting (doesn&apos;t seem convincing from a fan, haha...), Aaron Kwok is alright, but it is tiring watching him act cute. Daniel Wu was great as his innocent friend, but the girlfriend, Gigi Lai, suck so bad. Special mention should go to Francis Ng, who once again proved himself to be one of the best actors in HongKong these days. James Lye, Lin Hoi and Cynthia Koh just provides extra eye candy.\n\nOver all, the movie is promising, but falls flat at the end of the second act.",

A. &quot;What&apos;s Cooking.&quot;  \n\nI particularly identified with Katie Holmes&apos;s character&apos;s incompetence at cooking Thanksgiving dinner when the other women in the theater were laughing uproariously at her efforts and I wasn&apos;t even sure what she was doing wrong, other than focusing like I would do more on the decorations than the food preparation. \n\nScreenwriter and debut director Peter Hedges filmed in poorly lit digital video on an evidently minuscule budget but with a terrific cast and mise en scenes. \n\nThe characters who embark on parallel picaresque odysseys in a quaintly but believably diverse Lower East Side tenement and suburbs to city road trip are refreshingly individual and un-stereotyped in surprising directions, even if the actors may overdo the theatrical flourishes.  Sean Hayes especially over-fusses his neighbor bit.  Patricia Clarkson is marvelous as a mother with daughter issues and cancer.  \n\nThere was nary a dry eye in the house at the end."

      "reviewBody": "While &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; is no doubt a great Godzilla film, it definitely has its problems and it not the non-stop awesome epic it has acquired as a reputation over the years.\n\nI think the film&apos;s rep as the &quot;ultimate Godzilla epic&quot; had to do with a few certain things. As kids, we certainly remember this movie being played on Saturday afternoons of the late late show because it does have a cool title and well, plenty of monsters. Also helping was the fact that after VHS got really popular, while plenty of Godzilla films were released (mostly shoddy released from cheapo companies), DAM was not released, and therefore was highly sought-after on the bootleg market. I remember reading a magazine in the mid-80&apos;s where one guy claims he paid $150 for as bootleg copy, imagine that! \n\nHow disappointing the DVD release is. While it&apos;s nice to have the film on disc, in English and widescreen, it has no title screen, no chapters, no extras, no nothing. \n\nThe film itself, well it is really good and a lot of fun. Aliens want to cause trouble for Earth, and get the monsters off Monster Island to destroy all the planet&apos;s major cities. Unfortunately, you hardly see any actual destruction of these cities, because it&apos;s pretty much just a quick shot or two (like Godzilla destroying the UN building in NYC, and that&apos;s that). All the monsters then get together in Tokyo (they seem to travel around the world really quickly) to collectively pounce on that city (well, where else?). Some really good destruction scenes happen here, and it is here where some good scenes were cut from the film, especially the famous &quot;Godzilla vs. Manda&quot; (the snake) scene, which you can see on a Toho &quot;deleted scenes and outtakes&quot; video. It&apos;s a quick scene but extremely cool to see and have, having read and heard about the missing fight since I was a little kid.\n\nReally disappointing is the actual final battle between Ghidrah and the monster group. Ghidrah hardly fires his lasers, and doesn&apos;t really seem to put up a great fight. But he still is probably the coolest looking monster Toho ever came up with, so he&apos;s a fan fave anyway. \n\nOf course the lack of monsters throughout the movie is a downer, because you barely even see some of them. Varan actually comes back for a quick shot at the end of the movie when his rubber puppet just kind of rises from behind a mountain and then shoots up into the sky. \n\nThere is a lot of action though, a decent plot, good music, pretty Japanese girls, and a lot of cool camera shots. While DAM isn&apos;t quite the legend it is made to be, it probably is the last truly great Godzilla film of the original series.",

Richard Dreyfuss plays an unforgettable role as the exuberant and creative sculptor who becomes paralysed from the neck down after a car accident and argues for his right to be discharged from hospital so that he can end his life.\n\nThe entire cast provide great performances including Christine Lahti, John Cassavetes, Bob Balaban but it is Richards Dreyfuss which makes this film as brilliant as it is. He takes you on a journey where the viewer actually feels pain when he is in pain, we feel sad when he is sad and laugh when he laughs.\n\nAlthough the movie is about the right to die, it is not at all depressing. It is a movie filled with raw emotion, love and humour. Definitely a must see movie"

It was Harlan&apos;s first feature film in Agfacolor and clearly his use of color is not as elaborate yet as in &quot;Immensee&quot; or &quot;Opfergang&quot;, but still quite impressive, especially in Söderbaum&apos;s vision of the &quot;golden city&quot; and the finale on the moors. Söderbaum&apos;s acting has a natural and sometimes dreamlike quality - no doubt she was one of the stars of European cinema the camera really loved. There are some ideological undertones reflecting the political climate, but certainly not more than in Russian oder American films of that period.",

McLeod forces Charles to think and judge based on his knowledge not on suspicion or hearsay. the final scene speaks volumes about what their relationship was and what it meant to each of them. this film ranks up there with &quot;a separate peace&quot; and &quot;dead poet&apos;s society&quot; as a teen awakening film.",

The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. The directing was worse than a soap opera, and the stories are pointless and boring. I can see why this went Direct-to-DVD, because it is that bad. This reminds me of a poor mans &quot;Tales from the Hood.&quot; There is nothing even mildly entertaining about this garbage either! I don&apos;t know why Snoop continues to try and act and produce movies that couldn&apos;t be shown on the Sci-Fi channel at Midnight! How this got made is beyond me. Please whatever you do, don&apos;t waste your time on this absolute garbage. I would recommend you try watching the above mentioned &quot;Tales from the Hood&quot; which is ten times more entertaining than this, and even that isn&apos;t that great, but it makes that look like a masterpiece.",

The characters were interesting, the relationships explored to a somewhat greater depth than I expected, and the actors gave it their all.\n\nCorey Haim in probably the last thing I saw him in where he seemed to care, establishes great rapport with the other characters in the movie and makes you actually care about his life.  (As I said, amazingly enough--I wanted to just laugh this movie off, but really did like it...)\n\nDon&apos;t expect Speed or something that polished, but see the movie if you would like to have an enjoyable couple of hours where you won&apos;t have to think too much.",

      "reviewBody": "I was quite surprised by what I saw when watching this film. It turns out to be pretty straightforward in educating the public of the possibilities of what is happening in the African area between the Sudanese and militia Janjaweed. The film opens with reporters going on an excursion with the assistance of the nation of Africa&apos;s captain as both a guide and chaperone. They run into a small village on their way to a place pretty far off and distant in the desert. The two easily identifiable stars in this film are Billy Zane and Edward furlong. The two heros are virtual unknowns. It turns out that the janja weed militiamen raid these villages for sex and acknowledgement of existence...they want to be feared and revered as very very important and are told to the viewer that they are a threat to any public villager closeby the Sudan country. For some reason it seems to explain that the main two differences between people of that region are African and Arab. so the heightened climax of the film happens after the Janjaweed encounter the Americans and the African captain at this small village in Darfur...not too far away from Sudan.The Janjaweed then wreak havoc and the Americans are frightened away Until two of the crewmembers decide that there will be unnecessary bloodshed and that they feel that they could at least assist in battle to protect some of the innocent lives that will be killed by the Janjaweed raiders. Its a very violent film.",

      "reviewBody": "WWII star-vehicle for Goldie Hawn, here cast as a Rosie the Riveter-type who goes to work in an airplane-parts factory after her husband reports for duty. Poor beginning and hastily-filmed conclusion redeemed somewhat by bright moments in the middle. Hawn seems to realize she&apos;s being upstaged by Christine Lahti (as a &quot;tramp&quot; who lives in the same housing complex) and the final moments flip-flop trying to restructure the film&apos;s focus in Goldie&apos;s favor (check out that final shot). There&apos;s nothing wrong with that--Goldie&apos;s a wonderful presence and she&apos;s very appealing in parts of the movie--but her character as written just isn&apos;t all that interesting. As the men vying for Hawn&apos;s affections, Kurt Russell and Ed Harris are handsome and serviceable. As for Lahti, she indeed shines, obviously relishing the chance to play against type. I just wish the interaction between Lahti and Hawn had been explored with more depth, but it isn&apos;t. This is the fault of the screenwriter (the non-existent &quot;Rob Morton&quot;, who is really Bo Goldman, Ron Nyswaner, and Nancy Dowd, here doing a WWII variation on &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which Dowd also had a hand in) and also Goldie Hawn, who reportedly fought with director Jonathan Demme over control of the piece. They are all to blame for the slim box-office receipts &quot;Swing Shift&quot; struggled to bring in. **1/2 from ****",

The God Who Wasn&apos;t There brings to light some jaw-dropping information on the real origins of Christianity in an engaging and thoroughly entertaining way. A must see for everyone who has suspected that their Sunday school teacher might not have given them the whole story. Also has fascinating and thought-provoking interviews with some of the top scholars investigating the question of the historical Jesus and whether he really ever existed at all. I was particularly struck by the insights on modern Christianity and some of its more troubling aspects. The director, Brian Flemming, takes on all these topics but never loses his humor or warmth. I&apos;m also looking forward to the DVD release, because the special features will be including more commentary tracks and interviews with figures such as world-famous biologist Richard Dawkins and groundbreaking Biblical scholar Earl Doherty. An amazing , excellent film!",

Knowing the Grinch was going to be played by the Terrifier and seeing the trailer had me thinking this movie would be hysterically bloody.\n\nIronically, it was nowhere near as gory as I anticipated, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. All of the Dr. Suess easter eggs were cute.\n\nThis film had a lot of potential to really be a wonderful com-horror parody, but I felt they dropped the ball by not letting the Grinch speak. Given that the Grinch has always spoken and drove the story, to have him non-verbal appeared to be a missed opportunity, especially given how violent he was supposed to be in this movie.\n\nSecond thing was the acting was lack-luster and the dialogue not particularly well-written. Obviously this film did not have the budget equivalent of a Marvel film, but the acting just left a lot to be desired. That said, the actor playing the deputy did a serviceable job and of course Mr. Thornton did an outstanding job as the Grinch considering he was limited to body language to convey the character.\n\nAll in all not terrible. I have seen better&lt; but also seen much worse.",

For all his excessive lifestyle that became almost a parody of the drug culture, he remained a true intellectual and anti-corruption/hypocrisy crusader. He embraced the vision of a new world not ruled by greed and war-mongering, and as early as 1971 proclaimed his great sadness that the movement and the moment of flower power had passed and with it the chance for sane politics. This moment was captured well in &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; starring Bill Murray as HST, which is given kind of short shrift in this documentary in favor of scenes from &quot;Fear and Loathing Las Vegas&quot; with Johnny Depp as HST. Considering that Depp produced and narrates the film as well as financed the grandiose send-off that Thompson envisioned for himself, it&apos;s not strange that Murray&apos;s portrayal would be downplayed, as excellent as it was (and Peter Boyle&apos;s as the Samoan lawyer.) \n\nAll in all, it is a well-balanced account of Thompson&apos;s life and work, with many pertinent interviewees like his two wives and son, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone, Sonny Barger of the Hell&apos;s Angels, Jimmy Buffett, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Pat Buchanan, Tom Wolfe, and various Aspenites. His passion and wit were undeniable, and his addiction to guns, booze and dope were in many ways forgivable. But his absence in today&apos;s disastrous political scene, his voice against war and corruption is sorely missed, and lamented by several of the interviewees. The parallels between Nixon and Bush are easily drawn, and &quot;Gonzo&quot; does this without hammering the point home except to exhort the audience to take up the fight that the Good Doctor waged in a seemingly crazy, but noble and honorable way for most of his life.",

Closest resemblance is probably Others, and I&apos;d also name Saint-Ange and Awakening for some similarity in its atmosphere. \n\nI may safely agree with the other reviewer that Haunter is not scary at all, just couple of very primitive boom-based jumpers. \n\nKeep in mind that the Haunter director (Vincenzo Natali) once shoot such gem as Cube, and it shows through all 97 minutes. The movie is claustrophobic and weird,it&apos;s cheating you on time and dimensions, and that&apos;s the best part. Very solid directing, script and acting yet nothing that can leave you thinking further or wondering. \n\nAs soon as you realize that lots of ideas are brought from Cube the Haunter loses on IMDb stars instantly. \n\nStill don&apos;t get me wrong, it has its own developments, and I personally liked the way Vincenzo Natali delivers moody look, creative frames, and elaborated sets in a very contrast to minimalistic Cube.\n\nTo sum up: a solid 6/10 - not impressive but very fair dish for ghost genre lovers.",

      "reviewBody": "An enjoyable film with some great characters and an interesting story. The version I saw has an inappropriate and often irritating score that sounds about forty years too modern, and drastically takes away from the flapper-age energy and dance scenes. The beginning of the film is tedious, choosing to dwell a bit long on setting the scene, but once the main characters are introduced and the story begins to unfold, it captures and holds your attention. \n\nAnna May Wong contributes the film&apos;s best performance. She has that rare, powerful aura that illuminates the screen, like Greta Garbo or Louise Brooks. When her character, Sho-Sho, is in a scene, you can only focus on her, and she carries you away with intensity conveyed by only the merest subtle expression.\n\nThe other actors were &quot;okay&quot; but nothing special. The characters of Victor and Mabel, presumably popular and adored dancers, failed to convince me that they had any charisma whatsoever. Sho-Sho&apos;s scenes with Valentine, the club owner who wants to make her a star (and his lover) are mesmerising, showing passion and titillating innuendo. But the really interesting relationship is that of Sho-Sho with &quot;Jim&quot;, a Chinese fellow who seems to live with her -- is he a brother? a lover? it is unclear, but he is totally submissive to her and proud and jealous at the same time. She treats him like a dog, but they obviously have a close bond and need each other.\n\nAs a film in general, &quot;Picadilly&quot; is lacking on a few levels, but it is completely redeemed by Anna May Wong&apos;s presence. I can&apos;t give it a high rating overall, but I highly recommend it to Anna May Wong fans.",

And the similarities are unexpected. Both movies are set on subs, both movies involve terrorists (of a sort), both movies are very cheaply done, and critically unrealistic. What&apos;ve those links got to do with each other?\n\n You&apos;ve got underwater listening devices that can identify screws among wreckage, an American submarine commander who has way less battle-sense than his Russian counterpart, and bad guys with ridiculously unrealistic, paranoid objectives. Anyone in any military service anywhere in the world could probably expand vastly on that list. They&apos;d probably start with: instruments that do not register with military accuracy, but icons and labels that are marketed to American civilians."

      "reviewBody": "Based on the real life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, Bound By Honor covers two decades in the latter half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of half brothers Benjamin Bratt and Jesse Borrego and their cousin Damian Chapa. Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one&apos;s destiny is caused by the actions of the others.\n\nBorrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.\n\nBratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego, Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt&apos;s first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison, to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.\n\nBound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it&apos;s a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn&apos;t flag for a minute.\n\nHackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention, always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads. You get to care about what is to become of them, what destiny has in store.\n\nThere are certain similarities between Bound By Honor and the Edward James Olmos film, American Me. Personally I give a slight edge to this one, don&apos;t miss it if it is broadcast.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m sure that even in 1910 when Kaiser Wilhelm still had a few fans who remembered he was the grandson of Queen Victoria and not ruler of the soon to be hated foe of World War I, E.M. Forster must have come in for a few critic&apos;s slings in having some of his protagonists of Howards End have a German surname. Even that early time there were many who saw Germany as a potential foe.\n\nThese two Schlegel sisters played by Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter befriend the Wilcoxes, a family of newly rich plutocrats headed by Anthony Hopkins who seem to be a version of Lillian Hellman&apos;s the Hubbards lite. Their mother is the class of the family and she&apos;s played by Vanessa Redgrave who is in poor health.\n\nWhile Bonham-Carter is rejected by Hopkins&apos;s son James Wilby as a suitable wife for marriage, Vanessa befriends Thompson finding her to be a kindred intellectual spirit in a house full of moneygrubbers. In fact before she dies she writes an unsigned note asking that a cottage that&apos;s in her family&apos;s name called Howards End be given to the Schlegel sisters. When Hopkins and the rest of the family find the note after she&apos;s dead it gets torn up and burned. Unsigned it has no probative value in any event.\n\nBut as fate would have it Thompson and Hopkins get into a relationship and they soon marry and she tries to polish some of the rough edges off him. Especially in regard to snobbery. Hopkins is the kind of man who wants no reminders of where he came from. Particularly with another of the Schlegel sisters friends, a young clerk named Leonard Bast played by Samuel West trying to make his way in the world as the Wilcoxes have.\n\nEmma Thompson won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Howards End that year and the film also won Oscars for Art&amp;Set Direction and for adapted screenplay. Though Thompson won the Oscar, my absolute favorite in this film is Susie Lindeman as Mrs. Dolly Bast. She&apos;s so incredibly common and obviously holding him back, you can&apos;t blame West for eventually getting involved with Bonham-Carter which leads to tragedy.\n\nThe team of Ismail Merchant producer and James Ivory director succeed again at bringing the look and manners of Edwardian England as seen by E.M. Forster to life. Who says they don&apos;t make literate films any more, whoever says that have them see Howards End.",

She tells stories of evil witches and how her best childhood friend was kidnapped by a witch. Out of the blue, Luke&apos;s parents have a car accident and die and Helga becomes Luke&apos;s guardian. They move to England and one day, a woman approaches and speaks to Luke, but he identifies that she is a witch. One day, Helga falls ill and her doctor tells that it is her diabetes. She decides to travel to a seaside hotel to recover from her diabetes. On the arrival, Luke befriends the fat boy Bruno Jenkins (Charlie Potter) and has problems with the manager Mr. Stringer (Rowan Atkinson) because of his pet white mice. Meanwhile a group of women from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children arrive for a convention with their leader Miss Eva Ernst (Anjelica Huston). But soon Luke learns that Eva is indeed the Grand High Witch and their convention is to distribute a magic potion to turn boys into mice in England. When the Grand High Witch sees Luke, she turns him into a mouse. What will the boy do?\n\n&quot;The Witches&quot; is one of the most delightful movies from the 90&apos;s. This film has not aged and the timeless story is wonderful no matter the age of the viewer. That cast is perfect and Anjelica Huston is fantastic in the role of a powerful witch.

      "reviewBody": "Before getting into a review of DER WEG INS FREIE (&quot;Way towards freedom&quot; in its verbatim translation but sometimes titled THE WAY IN THE OPEN AIR), let me say something about the leading star. This Ufa production is released on DVD not due to any of its historical significance but because of Zarah Leander.\n\nBorn Zarah Stina Hedberg in Sweden, she was the major star, the major femme fatale, the captivating singer, the model of &apos;modern woman&apos; at the German Ufa Studios. Therefore, the observation that Marlene Dietrich&apos;s achievements in Hollywood may compete with Zarah&apos;s ones in Germany does not occur baseless. In spite of a considerably short time span of her career (1936-1943) or accusations of some political affiliations hostile to the regime in power then, no one could resist Leander&apos;s appeal. Although Goebbels referred to her as &quot;Enemy of Germany,&quot; regime propaganda could not ban the indisputably powerful model of female characters she created. One of such films is DER WEG INS FREIE, where she does not only sing but also evokes the excessive splendor of costumes and displays the wide range of emotional acting capabilities. We can say that the film was made at the peak of Zarah&apos;s career at Ufa under the direction of Rolf Hansen whom she had already known as an assistant director of Carl Froehlich she had collaborated with.\n\nSupposedly, the film, to a great extent, captures the uniqueness of an artistic personality and the conflicts of both the inner and the outer worlds: the inner ones are the pains towards inspirations, the outer ones are the pains of being misunderstood. Note that the characters of the movie (except for the artist who stands in the lead ... alone) belong to two locations: the first is the Vienna of Chancellor Metternich (1813-1848) – with restricted freedom and intensely monarchical but still the great as the city of music and glamorous life with vast possibilities; the second is the Prussian mansion at Pommern in the midst of folk customs and village-like atmosphere, idyllic simplicity where we hear cocks crowing in background. The artist is alone, she is within her world but, consequently, as the dilemmas grow, she resorts to mute suffering. In the opening scene, this &apos;different world&apos; the artist lives in is nicely over-toned. Yet, what is noteworthy is the context, the two operas used as a clever conceit to frame the plot: first, Rossini&apos;s SEMIRAMIDE the importance of which was accurately referred to by the musicologist Rodolfo Celleti who saw it as the &quot;last opera of the great Baroque tradition: the most beautiful, the most imaginative, possibly the most complete&quot; (here, the heroine&apos;s world is beautiful but extinct); second, Verdi&apos;s RIGOLETTO where the tragic story and sacrificial decision is clearly echoed in the movie&apos;s leading character. And, as viewers dwell in emotional resonance of artist&apos;s stage performance, they soon realize that the reality is waiting in the wings – earthly reality intensely affected by the artistic one but the sequence is supplied with doomed anticipation of events. Meanwhile, Rigoletto&apos;s Gilda becomes our heroine, Antonia (Zarah Leander).\n\nLeander&apos;s character, clever at wit and charm so expected of the woman of her rank, is influenced by choice, or to be more dramatic, dilemmas. As an Italian singer, she remains neutral on the scale of discrepancies between Austria and Prussia but, by embodying the inner conflicts, marriage vs. career clash within her. The &apos;socially&apos; and &apos;morally&apos; right way of family life with her husband, the Prussian officer Detlev Von Blossin (played marvelously by ) struggles with &apos;individually&apos; desirable way of being &apos;the most beautiful and the most applauded woman.&apos; To make things worse, another man appears in her life, the haunt of the past, the one she once believed in but now has to flee from, Count Oginsky (played by Siegfried Breuer). While the two men stand in contrast, Antonia parallels with all imagery of the movie manifested in light and shadow (note the scene in her villa with Oginsky, the turmoils in the streets and the moving shadows). \n\nThese ostentatious set designs, these beautiful interiors evoke the subtlety of these movies no longer found in cinema. But the most fertile theme in is expressed in her tragedy, in her quest for &apos;open air&apos;, in her typical female beauty that cannot fulfill herself in this world. In one scene, so much echoing the Swedish silents&apos; predominant use of visuals in Stiller&apos;s GOSTA BERLING SAGA, she laments in her carriage at the side of friend Barbaccia (Hedwig Wangel). In the finale, in more or less typical touches of the time, Ms Leander brings all to a tear jerking conclusion. That&apos;s a totally different world she lives in and a totally different way out she chooses.\n\nBut Leander, like Dietrich, does not only play her role with ease but also sings skillfully with the wonderful music by Theo Mackeben. It is still worth listening to her deep voice that was so much appreciated in the Germany of the time.\n\nHer leading men deliver equally powerful performances. While Bruewe portrays a more calm, down-to-earth, positive male character whose principles are clear and passion is a simple family life in the country, Breuer depicts an unprincipled character, furious, dominant, bossy. In one scene, we see him breaking mirrors. For both, revolutionary ideas, however, are alien though the motives are pretty diverse. As a female charm that has nothing to do with femme fatale comes Eva Immermann as Luise whom Detlev marries. She has some blissful moments in the movie, usually the moments in nature or at calm, less ostentatious sets.\n\nHer job was to make other people happygeneralized as it may seem, she makes us realize that along with her final choice, the way to freedom is wide open by gentle wind blowing through open window and moving the curtains for the deep sleep. But whose way is it, actually? Open for viewers ready to appreciate this gem of old German cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, at least compared to the two Matt Helm flicks immediately preceding it. After a couple of pretty big missteps, the series returns to the fine form of the first film, The Silencers. This is in no doubt very much due to the return of that film&apos;s director, Phil Karlson of Walking Tall fame.\n\nWhile the budget was obviously reduced for this one, it may have helped the pacing, which is not bogged down by cumbersome set pieces and elaborate gadgets. From the time Helm first arrives at Contini&apos;s château, the movie races breezily along helped by well choreographed (by Bruce Lee!)fight scenes in place of the earlier movies&apos; overblown hovercraft chases, runaway spaceships and the like. Additionally, this is the only one of the 4 Helm movies where the main villain&apos;s death doesn&apos;t seem anti-climatic. The soundtrack is great and absolutely helps to keep things moving along as well.\n\nThis cast is most enjoyable, with Nigel Green stealing the show while stealing the gold. He delivers many of the best lines in the movie, nay the series. Nancy Kwan and Elke Sommer are excellent as a couple of deadly femme fatales and Tina Louise is rescued from Gilligan&apos;s island just in time to give Helm his first lead. Sharon Tate showed a proclivity for comedy that was so deft and popular with movie goers that she was supposed to reprise her role in the never to be made The Ravagers. Also notable was the film debut of a little known martial arts expert named Chuck Norris. Dino himself seems to be enjoying the proceedings this time around and is a little more energetic. MacDonald, Helm&apos;s boss, is now being played by John Larch and actually takes part in some of the action.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one tight, exciting and truly funny (without being silly) little movie, at least by Dean Martin Matt Helm standards. It&apos;s too bad this was the last in line, because it could have served as the action comedy template going forward.",

      "reviewBody": "Believe it or not (and many fanboys don&apos;t), Aliens vs Predator was actually a financial success at the box office. Therefore a sequel was never going to be far behind. However, the studio was aware that the core Aliens/Predator fans felt short-changed from the first instalment, therefore the answer - apparently - was to make the sequel &apos;darker.&apos; They succeeded. Aliens vs Predator 2 (or &apos;Requiem&apos; for whatever reason) is indeed darker. In fact, sometimes it&apos;s so damn dark you can hardly see what&apos;s going on at all. Guess what... the fanboys still hated it.\n\nIn fact, it got such a bad reception (both critically and commercially) that it managed to kill the franchise (not counting Prometheus). Therefore, you could be forgiven for thinking that watching Aliens vs Predator 2 is not that far away from having needles stuck in your eyes for an hour and a half. But that&apos;s going a little too far.\n\nIt takes place only moments after the first film has ended. A half alien/half Predator has crash-landed on Earth, bringing with it a wave of death and destruction to a small American town. A &apos;cleaner&apos; Predator is therefore despatched to sort it out so that the humans remain unaware of both races existence.\n\nIt&apos;s not as bad as some people make out. Yes, it&apos;s no classic, but it is your average monster-munching movie. And perhaps that&apos;s the problem. And film with either the &apos;aliens&apos; or the &apos;Predator&apos; attached to it is expected to be a hell of a lot better than your average monster-munching movie. And, sadly, this one will never achieve such a high status as its seventies/eighties predecessors.\n\nIt all seems a little like a teen slasher film. Instead of hardened soldiers (ala Predator), or Colonial Marines (ala Aliens), we have high school kids being stalked by the famous monsters. I can&apos;t put my finger on it, but it just doesn&apos;t really work.\n\nNo, AVP2 is not as bad as the real haters say, it&apos;s just that it could have been so much better. Don&apos;t set your expectations too high and you might get a decent (if practically pitch black) hour and a half out of it.",

True, despite his co-star status in the movie&apos;s title, the serpent figures very little in the film&apos;s action, most of the heavy&apos;s duties being taken over by the fascinatingly treacherous Richard Devon and the equally charming Susan Cabot (the Wasp Woman herself). Lithe Abby Dalton plays the Viking leader with appropriate girlish gusto, while twisted but surprisingly ungrateful Jay Sayer has his menacing moments as a petulant prince. The story is absolute nonsense from first to last, but Corman keeps the action moving at such a commendably fast clip from go to whoa, a total lack of conviction doesn&apos;t really amount to a factor that will upset rabid American-International fans.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; is a very entertaining horror movie produced by Steven Spielberg. It&apos;s takes the fear of spiders to the next level. The film opens with an expedition in South America where a very deadly tarantula puts the bite on an American photographer, killing him in the process. Just before the body gets transferred back to the U.S., the spider sneaks into the coffin. Once in the states, the tarantula quickly mates with a domestic house spider and that creates the ultimate nightmare. Before you know it, a new strain of spiders have been born, that these little creepy crawlers are just as lethal! Jeff Daniels is excellent as the new doctor in town who hates spiders. He begins to realize something strange is happening. A couple of deaths occur, and the doc feels that these unexpected demises might be spider related. And man it&apos;s a scary ride to the finish. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; literally gave me the creeps. And it&apos;s also funny. Many of the film&apos;s comedy is provided by John Goodman as the town exterminator. He&apos;s literally a hoot. The thing about this movie that surprised me is that I was pulled into the story right from the beginning and it kept my attention all the way to the end. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was directed by Frank Marshall, Spielberg&apos;s long time collaborater, in his directorial debut. Marshall did a very good job his first time out helming a film which looked like a promising career move at first. He made his second film, &quot;Alive&quot; a few years later (I&apos;ve not seen this one yet). Then he made &quot;Congo&quot;, which was one of the worst movies of 1995, and hasn&apos;t directed another movie since (at least not to my knowledge). But &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was an above average debut for Marshall. He&apos;s got good potential as a director. This isn&apos;t a brilliant movie, but a good one. And it&apos;s lots of fun. One word of warning: if you have a fear of spiders, don&apos;t watch this. You&apos;ll probably hate it. Don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.\n\n*** (out of four)",

      "reviewBody": "A killer is going around in an army camouflage jumpsuit slicing up the desirable high school majorettes with their trusty knife and leaving their bodies immerse in water. Lt. Roland Martell is put onto the case with the help of the local sheriff, but the body count is rising. There are some punk bikers and their leader is a prime suspect, but could it be the perverted school janitor or maybe his deceiving mother who plans to take over the inheritances of the old lady she&apos;s looking after.\n\nWhat in the name?! This is one extremely patchwork film that has so much going on in its heavily plotted premise that it feels like everything has been chucked into a blender. Yummy camp that&apos;s frightening for all the wrong reasons. I was rubbing my eyes in disbelief in how ridiculously stupid it gets! What starts off as your conventional copy and paste high school slasher turns into an embarrassing revenge action story. Huh? Where did that come from? We watch one of the characters go &quot;Rambo&quot; on us. It&apos;s raining down gunfire and unnecessary explosions. Pure anarchy! These sudden incomprehensible shifts in the fitful story truly made it one unpredictable smörgåsbord of gratuitous 80s cheese. The slasher element is poorly done, but sticks to the main gruel. Vixens who get their clothes off when they can. A POV shot with heavy breathing to inform us it&apos;s the killer. Bloody murders (although they are mostly the same old repetitive kills; knife to the throat routine) on &quot;unexpected&quot; victims. And red herrings around each corner. The banal nature of this segment suddenly turned moronic in falling by the wayside. The a-wire action is plain bizarre, and rather guilty entertainment. A lot people bite the dust and there are unexpected surprises in who does too. Sounds complicated well no, just messy and padded out.\n\nSome of the key players in Romero&apos;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; are who to thank for this shamble. The premise is taken from writer John Russo&apos;s own novel and the script he dragged off it is completely insipid and dank across the board. Is the novel that bad? The amateurishly leaden acting makes matters even worse and there&apos;s no real central figure rounding it off. The ladies in the picture look nice, but do little else. Bill Hinzman (zombie in the graveyard in the opening scene of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;) is in the director&apos;s chair, but you wouldn&apos;t know it. One or two decent stalk scenes are there, but there wasn&apos;t much control and direction seemed quite non-existent. Being plastered with a low budget immensely brings it down and leaves a lot to be desired. The off-kilter story just didn&apos;t make too much sense or did the other pointlessly out-of-left-field sub-plots to the bigger picture. It feels fairly longer than it actually is and this erratic mood swings enhanced it even more. A tacky one-note music score is especially jerky and the stale camera-work only hurts your eyes. Mindlessly idiotic and mundane accurately sums up the hack-eyed presentation and feeble production.\n\nThis z-grade stinker entertains in its unintentional wackiness, but you can find yourself doing it tough in a glut of unbearable shoddiness. Be afraid be very afraid.",

The majority of the CGI effects look fake and outdated, and some of the spiders are obviously tarantulas in miniature environments. But, a fairly decent sequel offering which is better than most..."

In a way, there are plenty of events here, but you get the impression that several stories were cut out from something and directly glued together without any explanation what happened between them. Those pieces are joined together by leading female character but sometimes it feels like the other characters popped out randomly. I do not understand this but plenty of things happen and there are hardly interesting to follow. The novel by Żeromski was not that long and the film is quite lengthy. Nonetheless, it could possibly be better when converted to miniseries, obviously with some extensions to understand the motives and suffering of the main character (compare Lalka film and series). Disappointing, but I would not discourage from seeing and making one&apos;s own opinion about it.",

      "reviewBody": "Wim Wenders is one of my favorite filmmakers, and like Scorsese and Tavernier, he is a world-class cinephile, as much in love with watching movies as he is making them. The problem with &apos;The American Friend,&apos; I think, is similar to the problem of most contemporary films noir, which is, it&apos;s made with the knowledge it&apos;s a film noir. But it fails for a different reason than, say, &apos;L.A. Confidential.&apos; The latter film is simply a big-budget period reconstruction of film noir, like something from the candy sampler box of film genres. It has no life of its own and is sort of like the model they show you when you&apos;re shopping around for a home in a new development; the furniture&apos;s well-chosen and neatly in place, but no one lives there. Other contemporary noirs, like Altman&apos;s &apos;The Long Goodbye,&apos; approach the genre from a revisionist angle, and &apos;The American Friend&apos; does it from the wrong angle, from a cinephile&apos;s angle.\n\nThe movie feels studied, like an academic exercise. It has no edge, no spontaneity. One can appreciate the movie, its cheeky comment on the art world, its humanism, without really enjoying it, and that&apos;s the trouble.\n\nI&apos;ve seen the movie twice and while its bold primary colors were appealing, and its meditative pace pleasurable to an extent, I found it a bit of a chore. It&apos;s interesting to see noir slowed down to a crawl, and Nicholas Ray is a delight, and surely, some sequences are involving, but the whole affair is lacking. Wenders&apos; intensity has always been augmented by a certain lightness of touch, and that&apos;s what made the noir elements of &apos;Until the End of the World&apos; a lot of fun. &apos;The American Friend&apos; is too austere, though. Too muted. I thought &apos;Purple Noon,&apos; René Clément&apos;s 1960 adaptation of the other Patricia Highsmith novel, was too muted the first time I watched it, but on subsequent viewings thought it to be engaging, almost musically so. Metaphysical heaviness for once bogs down a Wenders film rather than enhancing it."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m starting to like this new genre of science fiction romance that &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; falls into. Hollywood seems to have learned how to add a significant amount thought to their films, just with their usual dumbing-down procedures.\n\nDavid (Matt Damon) has met Elise (Emily Blunt) and based on one spontaneous kiss and one flirtatious encounter, he&apos;s determined that she&apos;s the one he&apos;s supposed to be with. They have other plans. Oh yes, the indefinable, ambiguous pronoun &quot;they&quot;. Just to keep a sense of the intrigue afloat, I&apos;ll define &quot;they&quot; as the men of &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot;. What they want, we don&apos;t really know. But David wants the girl—a beautiful girl—but just a girl nonetheless.\n\nFor us, questions of free will, fate, soul mates, success and pre-defined destinies abound. All running around an intricate maze of New York architecture. Although intricate might not be the best word because there&apos;s nothing here for us to figure out; the film lays everything out well in advance, and over and over again in case you missed it. At least there&apos;s intelligence to the story but unfortunately no subtlety.\n\n&quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; has pretty city-scapes and pretty people playing more profound characters than pretty people usually play. As with most genre-mixing films, there is something for everybody. I got the intelligence that is usually sorely missing from big-budget Hollywood action films although I could have done with a bit more respect.",

I&apos;m not a Sandy Dennis fan, but she was very good in this role, surprisingly.\n\nTwo of my favorite comedic actors are Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. I grew up on them. But, they just don&apos;t cut the mustard in this remake. I can&apos;t place my finger on it, but it just isn&apos;t funny. It&apos;s not just the writing, it&apos;s the actors and their direction.\n\nI was so excited when this movie was released. Who doesn&apos;t love John Cleese? Well, I don&apos;t in this role. I did enjoy seeing a great stand-up comic, Steve Mittleman, in a cameo role in the early portion of the film. Mittleman was one of the funniest comics I remember from my childhood days.\n\nThis movie is a waste of time."

They see just GM gave the people in Flint work, they don´t see that the people of Flint also made it possible for GM to become that what it is.

      "reviewBody": "1940&apos;s THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL, not to be confused with Republic&apos;s 1944 THE LADY AND THE MONSTER, was a rare Paramount excursion into Universal horror territory. This was the studio that brought genre fans the 1931 DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, 1932&apos;s ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, 1933&apos;s MURDERS IN THE ZOO, 1939&apos;s DR. CYCLOPS, and 1940&apos;s THE MAD DOCTOR, all quite distinctive and respectable. Leonard Maltin&apos;s review praises the originality of the white slavery angle, depicting how poor Ellen Drew is lured into a life of prostitution, while her brother (Phillip Terry) is executed for a murder he didn&apos;t commit, donating his brain to Dr. Parry (the great George Zucco) to use in a surgical procedure that puts his mind in the body of a gorilla. Maltin dismisses the mad doctor stuff as clichéd, but the truth is, all the characters are strictly by the numbers; it&apos;s quite possible that if it consisted of one storyline over the other, the results would never be remembered today. Like Boris Karloff in Warners&apos; 1936 THE WALKING DEAD, the vicious racketeers are marked for death from beyond the grave, and the second half of the film shows how the gorilla (Charles Gemora) manages to escape detection as it travels around town, executing all the gangsters with virtually no interference, aided by his faithful dog (!). This is not A BOY AND HIS DOG, and it really is better than it sounds, it&apos;s only disappointing in that little is made of Zucco&apos;s experiment, and his role is very small. Best of all is Charles Gemora&apos;s sensitive portrayal of a gorilla with a human mind, and it is excellent; it couldn&apos;t have been easy to act in such a costume, but it looks as good as any from old Hollywood, and is light years superior to Emil Van Horn&apos;s embarrassment in Bela Lugosi&apos;s THE APE MAN. A remarkable cast of familiar faces make this an easy watch, apart from the condescending Paul Lukas, whose accent was no match for Lugosi&apos;s (surely Bela would have been available). Look fast for unbilled Edward Van Sloan, veteran of FRANKENSTEIN and THE MUMMY, playing the prison warden who helps Zucco get the plot moving toward its inevitable climax (Zucco proved to be even busier than Lionel Atwill in that department).",

But I had to write one for this movie.\n\nStory was absolutely, needlessly, mind numbingly bad. I guess they couldn&apos;t decide on what plot to make the movie on. There&apos;s everything in this movie from thugs to terrorists who not only hate thailand but the whole world.\n\nThe movie had a budget of 60 million baht ($1.6 million), which is quite a lot for their currency. I guess they spend most of the budget on the fx. All the FX redering was very well done considering the budget. Probably the only positive thing in the movie.\n\nThe director mentioned that the goal of the movie was to appeal to the international movie audience. Well..... FX isn&apos;t just enough to appeal to audience. With FX one needs good acting. &quot;Good Acting&quot; this movie does not have. Even if you are watching this movie in thai, you can tell that the actors are quite bad.\n\nThe movie&apos;s crew involved a lot of people from the crew of Ong-Bak and Tom Yum Goom. Ong-Bak was good. Tom Yum Goom sucked but Mercury Man is better than that. Maybe their next movie will be better.",

      "reviewBody": "... and I am very glad I did.\n\nI had not seen the movie prior to going there 6 months ago, for two reasons: people told me it was boring, and when I started watching it, I was bothered by the orangey hue of the movie.\n\nI&apos;m glad that this time I persisted. By no means a classic, it certainly is entertaining, and the actions scenes are genuinely GOOD. \n\nI went to Rapa Nui because I was mesmerized with the idea of an ultra-isolated island where an ecological tragedy happened because of huge stone heads. In fact, I read extensively about the island before visiting it. The reading I recommend the most is Jared Diamond&apos;s book &quot;Collapse&quot;, which draws from reputable scientific sources and Mr. Diamond&apos;s encyclopedic knowledge of geography and biology.\n\nI was hoping to find an island of archaeological interest. What I found was an open-air museum that exceeded all my expectations about archeology, and also a very pleasant and delightful place to visit.\n\nThere is no crime. There is no pollution. The only (tiny) beach has white sand and blue water in a perfect temperature. The natives are incredibly nice and even the tourists were interesting (because, really, who goes there?). Now I have a toddler-sized moai in my living room and many wonderful pictures with stones, moai, sunsets, stones, blue sea, volcanoes, moai, and lots of more stones.\n\nAnd the trees? Around the only town, Hanga Roa, there are many of them! Traumatized with the haunting tale of environment destruction, people are starting to plant crops, and the hotels have beautiful gardens, and the whole town is shady and breezy because of all the trees. It&apos;s not all dryness and destruction.\n\nI also believe this movie is underrated. Don&apos;t go by the negative interviews! The orangey colors of the movie, though lamentable, don&apos;t detract from the overall experience, but if you can find a better copy, by all means do so.",

This is a gem that has something for everyone: sentimentality, humor, pathos, and loads of good performances. &quot;The Cop and the Anthem&quot; is probably the most tightly written of them all, with subtle touches of humor throughout (besides the most obvious gags). If I had to single out one performer who delighted me the most it would be David Wayne, doing a twitchy down-and-outer playing off of Laughton&apos;s haughty tramp (especially just having seen him play a totally different character in ADAM&apos;S RIB just a week ago).\n\nAs an old thespian friend of mine would say, &quot;The Last Leaf&quot; could bring a tear to a glass eye. And in &quot;Red Chief,&quot; Fred Allen and Oscar Levant make a strange but fun team. \n\nNot having seen Richard Widmark in the other movie mentioned in reviewer&apos;s comments, I could only think how much he reminded me of Frank Gorshin in various roles he played in the 60s. Watch this segment again and think &quot;Frank.&quot; \n\nYour whole family will like this movie. Why doesn&apos;t someone bring it out nice and crispy clean on DVD?",

      "reviewBody": "Amazing film.  The reviews posted  - at the time of this writing - on the IMDb page are sad, because I don&apos;t think the writers were ready for what kind of movie it is. (Stephen Holden&apos;s pan in the New York Times is especially foolhardy and thoughtless.) It helped to have a little advanced word, in order to brace myself. As it stands, it should have defeated &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; at Cannes last year, handily. And if I see a better movie this year, it&apos;ll be something for the history books.\n\nIt&apos;s not for the faint of heart. It&apos;s three hours and thirty-seven minutes long, in black and white, and in Japanese. And it&apos;s very slow-moving. The cinematography is beautiful, but that may not be enough for folks to hack through nearly four hours.\n\nBut the extreme length and slowness is not unjustified. It opens with a horrifying, traumatic event that provides an emotional undercurrent that informs the remainder of the story, in much the same way as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; did (let that not discourage the anti-Spielbergers), and as the film progresses, the event becomes a memory, part of the characters&apos; and ours, too. And the slowness isn&apos;t really slowness - it&apos;s the playing out of events and interactions as they would happen in real time (the story spans a few months, I believe, perhaps even a year, and maybe more).\n\n&quot;What&apos;s the freaking story?&quot; I hear you ask...well, here goes. The opening sequence, which will undoubtedly inspire comparisons and contrasts to &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (as will the entire film), shows the hijacking of a commuter bus by a businessman pushed over the edge. As the scene unfolds, he has already killed a few passengers, the police are surrounding the bus, and he has used newspapers to block all the windows.\n\nWithout revealing too much, the bus driver and two teens - a brother and a sister - survive the incident. The driver (Koji Yakusho, star of &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; and &quot;The Eel&quot;) is shaken deeply, and leaves his brother and parents to wander. The youths&apos; mother runs off with another man, and their father dies soon after in an auto accident - with insurance payments, they can live, but there is no one to watch over them.\n\nI could go into more of the plot - and most critics will, I&apos;m sure - but that isn&apos;t really necessary. The key to the movie is that the events seem to be played out as they would in real life, and that the movie camera just &quot;happens to be there&quot; to catch them and tell the story. Sure, this is the goal of all narrative films, but with &quot;Eureka,&quot; the process seems to have been reinvented and renewed. The film is longer than most, but not a moment is wasted; it&apos;s one of the most efficiently edited movies I&apos;ve ever seen. Every shot, nuance, glance, spoken word, everything has a reason for being.\n\nThere are some who say the movie is too somber, too gloomy. It isn&apos;t really. It&apos;s somber, sure, but it doesn&apos;t strain for it. There is humor - deadpan, mostly - and great joy, too. And if you love great cinema, there is even greater joy!",

      "reviewBody": "When the film begins, a gang of crooks are robbing a factory and stealing canisters of poison gas. However, when police cars near, the gang leader kills the minions who helped him with the robbery...so obviously he doesn&apos;t like any loose ends. Fortunately, one of these poor devils isn&apos;t quite dead and tells the police that the killer was Stone and something about a cellmate called &apos;Trevor&apos; who is about to do a job for Stone. It turns out Treavor is still in prison and is about to be released...and the plan is to substitute Agent Cotton (George Nader) for the famous safe-cracker. But the problem is that Stone ALWAYS ends up killing his hired help...so how is Cotton going to avoid this as well?!\n\nI&apos;ve only seen this and the first Agent Cotton film. Compared to the first, the production values are a bit better--with color film and some nice Los Angeles location shooting. HOWEVER, it&apos;s obvious that Nader isn&apos;t in these scenes and the shots are clumsily back projected-- with Nader and others acting in front of this screen. It&apos;s a very poor system...but even for rear projection this is the worst I have ever seen!! It&apos;s worse than the system that was used in &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; almost thirty years earlier!! The production team should have been embarrassed to use these scenes.\n\nThe most important parts are the plot, writing and acting....so are they any good? Of course. In fact, if the production values had just been a bit better the movie would have scored an 8. Quite enjoyable.\n\nBy the way, although I have enjoyed seeing the Agent Cotton films, unfortunately not all of them on YouTube are dubbed (or even subbed) into English. I know the films were originally dubbed into many languages but until I can find them, I may have to just be content with watching a few of the eight original Cotton pictures.",

      "reviewBody": "In my frustration over the lack of international titles being available in Region One, I decided to purchase Faccia a Faccia (Face to Face, disk no. IMBS-1148) at a DVD outlet online, from the U.K. You know, sometimes, it&apos;s better to simply take a gamble and purchase a title out of region, than wait for whether or not some company may - or may not - decide to print a DVD title. \n\nI enjoyed the acting of Tomas Milian and Gian Maria Volante enough to gamble on whether I&apos;d even be able to play the film. Fortunately, my Macintosh allowed for several out-of-region plays on my burner, and I found a hack online to play the disk on my portable player. \n\nFrom the opening credits, which exploit every hue of color, much of the film was worth the effort of dealing with the pesky region codes. A bit of the story line was a little far-fetched, as far as Volante&apos;s character is concerned, by the final third of the film. The ending left me a bit disappointed. \n\nMilian&apos;s character truly captured the show, however, from the moment he fell into the scene. And the music by Ennio and Bruno Nicolai. One can&apos;t go wrong with the musical scoring when this pair works together on an Italian Western. \n\nAs for the DVD, it&apos;s too bad that it isn&apos;t optimized for widescreen. I understand that there is a boxed set, which may have this film and other favorites of mine widescreen-ready. Check to be sure.\n\nIn closing... honestly, I am an Ennio fan, and a fan of Milian and Volante. My review is biased somewhat. I am also a fan of Sergio Leone, which makes me enjoy Italian Westerns a little less when he&apos;s not at the helm. But I made no mistake in purchasing this film.",

The characters have many dimenions and the viewer quickly cares and grows more curiousity towards the characters. Yes, many of the Dogme 95 guildlines are in this film however (must like Festen... another fabulous film) it is the story that makes this such a great film.\n\nAll characters in this film are completly different from eachother. The dialouge itself is not what makes this film great, it&apos;s the story of all these people combined.\n\nDogme films often show things that an American audience may have a hard time dealing with. If seeing something and learning from something that Americans can hide from is something that holds an interest than I highly recommend this film."

I&apos;m not sure of they tried to make it a kind of soft porn movie, it didn&apos;t need all that malarkey.\n\nThey&apos;re wise not to focus to greatly on shots of the Zygon creature itself, it&apos;s not the greatest but it isn&apos;t bad.\n\nWorth a watch. 7/10",

This film tries to be mysterious and creepy but fails on both levels because the screenplay is all over the place and never really makes a bit of sense. Character enter and exit the film without any explanation and the &quot;mystery&quot; of the Bermuda Triangle is never resolved or even talked about much, although the film tries to play claim to a cursed doll, which causes all the problems. There&apos;s some wonderful underwater photography but this too get hampered by three real sharks being killed on the screen for no reason. John Huston, Andres Garcia, Gloria Guida and Claudine Auger star."

There have been so many direct-to-video films that have followed the DIE HARD formula that one can not blame me for being less than excited about seeing BLAST. The cover art and the description on the DVD box made it seem like just about every other direct-to-video action flick that has come out in the past five years or so. However, unlike most direct-to-video action flicks, BLAST has a decent cast, a reasonably good screenwriter, and a fair share of laughs. That doesn&apos;t mean BLAST is necessarily a good movie. It isn&apos;t. In fact, if it were released theatrically, I would have been mad to pay the ticket price. Direct-to-video was the right choice for the film. It&apos;s better than most direct-to-video fare due to the charm of Eddie Griffin and his chemistry with Breckin Meyer. If it weren&apos;t for Griffin and Meyer, BLAST would truly be a waste of time. 5/10"

I&apos;m assuming that the film makers did not have the same access, because there is more behind the scenes footage than there is of the competitions. The opening ceremony (and the preparations leading up to them) alone takes up almost a quarter of the movie. There are lots of shots of athletes relaxing and eating, often with a Coke. There is also footage of related cultural events, such as a modern dance recital and a rock concert featuring (I believe) Johnny Hallyday. It&apos;s an interesting movie but anyone who is only interested in the athletic aspect of the Olympics which be better off just watching Snows of Grenoble.",

Mostly, it is a visual film, displaying the vulnerability of a few people in a harsh, vast, beautiful landscape. They must depend on each other, and they develop an intimacy based on their shared struggle rather than on deep conversations and emotional revelations, or at least, not until a young girl joins them. Weir seems to be commenting on the yin yang of masculinity/femininity at times in this film. I also liked the subtle underlying commentary on the brutal oppression of the Soviet regime under Stalin.\n\nAll of the actors were good; Farrell adds a touch of humor, Sturgess portrays anguish well, and Harris is a good tough old guy--his usual persona. By the way, Manohla Dargis in The New York Times complains that Farrell is too good-looking to be a Russian gangster. What this assessment is based on I can&apos;t imagine; doubt Dargis hangs with Russian gangsters.",

      "reviewBody": "Another of the earlier Romy movies, the period when she had been regularly playing Cinderella, with a known historical touch (Sissy, Deutschmeister or even Mädchenjahre einer Königin) or sometime without history (e.g. Scampolo).\n\nThis one is almost from the first category, there are historical characters (Tsar Alexander I, Prince Metternich of Austria, and even Empress Marie Louise &amp; off screen Napoleon I), though the disclaimers tells that there is no history in it, unlike her Marischka&apos;s historical ones, which had been closer to fact. \n\nThe story is thin, the poor Cinderalla, for a change is wooed by four persons, of varied power. \n\nTwo of them, A Prince of France, a regular philanderer, and Tsar is not with very honorable intentions, at least the Tsar didn&apos;t have any intention to make a Tsarina of her (though not mentioned in story, but history tells that he already had one at home). \n\nThe original sweet heart of course had to have honourable intentions, though there is the father, who is the thorn. Being son of a Prince (non-royal), and only child, this marriage would have been a mesalliance, which the Prince father naturally didn&apos;t want. \n\nThen there was he second power-house of the time, after Tsar, Prince Metternich of Austria. His intention were political, and purely noncarnal\n\nThe result of course is predictable, and to get her favours, the power houses quite willingly showered largesses on the young sweet-heart, probably, with mistaken notion of compensation, which naturally doesn&apos;t happen in stories, where she would have the cakes and later eat them.\n\nBut there are some glowing inconsistencies, of rank. If the Tsar had coveted someone, I don&apos;t suppose anyone of much lower rank would have dared to cross his path, even Prince Metternich was only a minister to Emperor of Austria, though a powerful one. \n\nBut strangely they continued to openly defy him, aware of their act. The sweet-heart, I can appreciate, though probably he would have lost his head, literally, but this wasn&apos;t the case with others who openly crossed Tsar&apos;s path.\n\nAnother problem I faces (usually I do) is lack of subtitles, even on web only one is available, which is quite incomplete, and not in sync.\n\nPlus points are of course Romy, and she even sang a song, I wonder with her voice, why she didn&apos;t a few more, either on screen, or off screen.\n\nNot bad for a pastime, though this could be one of her weaker attempts on the same basic story., or may be it was direction/ script.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1900 Egypt, an American archaeologist (Taylor) has a race with a rival exploitive British adventurer-explorer (Thompson) to find the fabulous [fictional] lost tomb of King Rahotep, a Pharaoh who may have known the Israelite Joseph, in Egypt&apos;s Valley of the Kings. Matters are complicated by unscrupulous Egyptian Arab black market antiquities dealers (in fine performances by character actors Victor Jory, Kurt Kasznar, Leon Askin) and the romance of a beautiful British Egyptologist (Parker) who arrives on the scene. The plot and story are contrived and melodramatic, but the production values, locations, acting, dialog, music score by the master Miklos Rozsa, and visual effects are superb. In other words, it makes up in style what it loses in content. Filmed partly on location in Egypt, in Cairo, the Giza Pyramids, Sakkara, Karnak and Luxor (the Great Temple of Amenhotep III), and the Valley of the Kings. Of particular interest is a fight scene staged atop one of the four colossi of King Ramoses II the Great at the Temple of Abu Simbel: part of it was filmed on location; part of it was replicated in the MGM studio soundstages with clever matte photography and grandiose sets. Climactic scene is the discovery of the splendiferous tomb of King Rahotep  full of art objects replicated from the artifacts found in the actual tomb of King TutankhAmen  in the Valley of the Kings. [Special note: there actually was a Pharaoh named Rahotep, who lived during the 17th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, circa 1750 B.C. and could have known sephardic Israelites like Joseph, who most likely lived circa 1850 B.C.] The Technicolor is beautiful. Highly enjoyable action romance. Great fun for fans, Egyptologists, and film addicts who just want to enjoy a good old fashioned yarn.",

The script was less than perfect going into production, and several endings were filmed for lack of a clear resolution. But don&apos;t let that stop you from seeing this film.  Stone and director Noyce polish a bad script into a fine music video.  It&apos;s like watching VH1 merge with the Playboy channel.  A fine soundtrack with an even better [unreleased] score from Howard Shore play well against the dramatic, color-rich backdrops and voyeuristic black and white camera shots.  It&apos;s very easy on the eyes, and perfect for a $14 dvd (if they ever release it)."

This is as good as Mascot gets, and in its way it might have rivaled some of Republics best work had it had a music track. Its a minor thing but the lack of music (something Mascot didn&apos;t really splurge for at any point) makes a little slow at times. That flaw aside this is one to watch. Its actually very good.",

      "reviewBody": "The title of this mid-feature documentary is deliberately double-edged. On the one hand, it describes the film&apos;s subject, female directors of the silent era, in remarkable abundance at that time - indeed, arguably the first great auteur was a woman,  Alice Guy.  On the other, it suggests feminists who cannot talk, women who have been written out of the film history books as easily as they were finally barred from the compartmentalised Hollywood that emerged with the coming of sound.\n\nThe possibility of notable female input in direction came about through the haphazard growth of the American film industry, as the constant and increasing demand meant one could go from script girl or editor relatively quickly.  Many famous actresses quickly became directors, following the model of their male counterparts, such as Chaplin.\n\nThe documentary isn&apos;t really in any way linear - the most notable figures are discussed with clips from their films, and there are interviews with directors, stars and even the daughter of the aforementioned Guy.  The directors talk about the period as a golden age of gender colour-blindness, it being perfectly natural and acceptable for egotisitcal male stars to take orders from a woman.  A sniggering interview with Henry Hathaway, who, with John Ford began his career as an assistant to Lois Weber, suggests otherwise.\n\nThe golden age ended with the coming of sound.  The job mobility that marked the silent age vanished, and everything - screenwriting, editing, art direction etc. - became rigidly compartmentalised.  This, and the rise in misogynistic male-dominated unions, meant that the mobility that led to direction was put on the brakes.\n\nOf course, it is one thing to resurrect unjustly forgotten figures; it is quite another to suggest they were any good.  None of the footage shown even remotely compares with Griffith, Feuillade, Lang, Murnau, Eisenstein or Keaton, although one director did interesting things with split screen, Lois Weber had genuine talent beneath her mawkish, proselytising pictures, and Dorothy Arzner was as ruthless, bullying and exploitative as any Hawks or Preminger.\n\nWhat singles them out from their male peers - this continued to be true of maverick female directors like Ida Lupino - is their willingness to tackle subject matter that was not oppressvely generic, but domestic, human, close to the audience&apos;s experience, themes such as birth control, rape, abusive marriages, or prostitution.  Hollywood, as it developed, preferred not to dwell on such themes, so the women went out with the bathwater.\n\nThe closing narration claims that these women were not feminists as we know the term today, that they were quiet, agreeable and dignified.  The insinuation is that today feminists are bolshy hyenas, unladylike, coarse. The film was written, produced and directed by two men.",

This time the fight is against the new model T-800 that can wipe out humanity from earth.\n\nIf you have to enjoy this movie you have to watch the movie with a fresh perspective and without any comparison from it&apos;s previously made parts. If you do so you will surely enjoy this movie.\n\nThere is nothing new in the plot and the plot is predictable and bit mash up but the execution of the movie is decent, the movie is filled with action scenes, gun fights, chases and some emotion.\n\nActing is superb and I have to admit that Christian Bale has infused a new life in the character of John Connor, he looks macho, strong and is perfectly effective. Sam Worthington was great and gives a superb support to Christian Bale, he impresses whenever he comes to the screen, rest all of the characters had limited screen space but they will impress.\n\nScreenplay is fast paced and intense and will keep you on the edge of the seat, action scenes are superb and must be appreciated, us of CGI is also effective. Few viewers might complaint that nothing new is been offered and CGI is been used excessively and I also agree to some extent, but still the movie is an all round decent action thriller movie which misses sometimes and sometimes got hit and we can&apos;t deny that it&apos;s a fun ride.",

It&apos;s this surreal symbolism that often keeps a Jess Franco movie above the average exploitation flicks, and &quot;Mansion of the Living Dead&quot; continued his best works of the 70s better than most of his movies from the 80s. It was shot at Gran Canaria in a deserted hotel, where 4 waitresses arrive for their holidays. Although they are assured the hotel is almost fully booked, they meet nobody and they sense there is something wrong here. In a long, beautiful scene without any dialog, one of the girls walks to an old church, while a stormy wind rings the church bell and shakes the branches of the palm trees. As a counterpoint to this slowly created spooky atmosphere, Franco introduces a crazy gardener for comic relief and of course shows what the girls do in their hotel room for the carnal element of the show ;-). But horror prevails as an order of undead satanic monks - many viewers feel reminded of the Spanish classic &quot;Tombs of the Blind Dead&quot; here - tries to get hold of the chicas for sacrifice... Not perfect, but recommendable.",

      "reviewBody": "It is not as if spoof comedies are terrible, on the contrary there are some brilliant ones out there like ones from Mel Brooks(Young Frankenstein) and Leslie Nielson(Airplane), even Scary Movie and Loaded Weapon 1 were fun if not quite in the same league. Like a lot of people, I do think Friedberg and Seltzer are hacks and not one of their previous five directing-writing efforts with Disaster Movie, Epic Movie,(two of the worst movies ever made), Meet the Spartans, Date Movie and Vampires Suck have been good. Curiosity and that there are some good examples of good spoofs out there were the sole motivations of seeing The Starving Games in the first place. This said after viewing, The Starving Games really is no improvements over the previous Friedberg/Seltzer collaborations though it doesn&apos;t quite stink as badly as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie. There are three fairly small bright spots, Maiara Walsh&apos;s game performance and the cute Angry Birds reference and Taylor Swift serenading a dying contestant moment(though that only raised a very meek smile). Visually, it&apos;s amateurish stuff, the impersonation costumes are also pretty good but that&apos;s it, the production values have low-budget TV quality all over it coupled with (thankfully sparse) poorly rendered effects, too many reaction shots(manipulating us into supposing to laugh) and some really choppy editing. The soundtrack feels thrown in and poorly placed, just there for the sake of it which makes it tiresome and sometimes tedious, that it isn&apos;t very catchy in the first place doesn&apos;t help either. The toilet-humour-heavy dialogue is vomit-inducingly crude, childish and unfunny is the best it gets which is testament to how truly terrible it is. The parodies themselves are no better, like Vampires Suck there is a main gag and other ones that are not as prominent. The parodies and impersonations are just tired, painfully predictable and often irrelevant, reeking of Friedberg and Seltzer just throwing like the most unsubtle of sledgehammers things in with no relevance or structure to them. And the jokes are drawn out especially the lottery draw one and the tasteless sex scene to the point of slowing the movie down. There was at least a story, unfortunately it comes across as a very thin one and is completely lost within the humour, which explains why some scenes were drawn out. The characters are just caricatures and nothing more, and despite Walsh&apos;s efforts you feel no shred of empathy for the lead character. The acting is awful, ranging from over-the-top(Diedrich Bader) to vacant. All in all, incredibly lame but is not Friedberg and Seltzer&apos;s worst. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

Best part of the whole movie. &quot;I want all references to the operative, the french teacher.&quot; Next, the dialog. It&apos;s funny. Most of the time, it&apos;s great. At least I find it funny most of the time.\n\nThe lead actor did a pretty good job. He&apos;s as flat as a pancake. But I think he&apos;s supposed to be a superficial high school student. They could have made him a bit more bright. He does save the day in the end. And it would be slightly more believable if he came across as a bit brighter from the start. But, you know, it&apos;s a comedy. You can&apos;t be too critical.\n\nI realize this is sort of a demographic movie. I am sure it&apos;s aimed at teens as a fantasy. At 45 though, I still appreciate a mindless fantasy/comedy/adventure. And this is a pretty good one. I think it deserves a better rating - I rate movies with based on similar movies. I don&apos;t compare this to Das Boot, for example. I compare it to say, Hackers or something like that.",

It has some weaknesses, but overall I didn&apos;t mind watching it.\n\nThe Weaknesses: No recognizable angelic names in it (with the exception of Gabriel). The bad guy (Zophael) is a total no-name, so you don&apos;t really know how to rank him (powerful/not powerful), which wasn&apos;t really a problem in the first part. There you knew that Simon was more powerful than Uziel; that Gabriel could beat Simon&apos;s ass; and that Lucifer could smack them all to hell in a handbasket. \n\nFunnily this works to advantage for the movie as you don&apos;t really know which side of the factions Zophael and who actually is the good/bad guy until somewhat in the middle of the movie. \n\nThe actors aren&apos;t all that good (with the exception of Walken, Spano - who brings that charisma back to the angels that was so severely lacking in the second part- and the Coroner who has grown to be one of my favourite characters in the three movies)\n\nStrenghts: The storyline is closed. I won&apos;t argue that it&apos;s the most coherent storyline, but it at least makes some moderate sense in itself. The musical score has always been one of the big things about the trilogy and they kept it -wisely- unchanged for the most part. This time around we have more funny scenes and even some jabs at the original &apos;The Prophecy&apos;, while not making it campy and keeping all the good bits (fights, heart ripping, supernatural powers etc.). Some of the moves seem very Matrix-like, but that was already the case in &apos;The Prophecy II&apos;, so I don&apos;t really know who copied from whom (It just seems so similar: Humans fighting against some overly powerful and nigh unkillable opponents in cool long dark suits). No matter: It&apos;s fun to watch. This time we also don&apos;t get treated to some candy sweet religious thing in the end, where the main character suddenly becomes a devout Christian - that&apos;s a big plus.\n\nOverall, I&apos;d recommend seeing this film. Best if viewed together with the other two or you will not get many of the references.\n\n7/10",

Another illogical thing was that how he could fall in love with a person whose face he has never seen. Apart from these, the film is amusing and the music is so touching. It made me cry. Salman Khan is such a good actor. And so is Kareena Kapoor. To sum up, the film is worth watching though there are some illogical parts because it&apos;s a romance and Bollywood is really good at romance.",

      "name": "A sweet, innocent, beautiful but flawed love story",
      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t understand why mutually consenting sex between brothers near the same age is a big deal. It&apos;s not as if they would produce deformed offspring. That particular taboo makes no sense to me. I&apos;m not advocating gay incest, but horror at the idea of sex between brothers – even in a movie, and even among gay men – mystifies me. I&apos;ve never been at all attracted to my own brother, but two brothers&apos; falling in love in a movie does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. I don&apos;t feel compelled to try to twist it into something else that&apos;s more acceptable.\n\nPeople who say it&apos;s easy to forget that Francisco and Thomás are brothers in the latter half of the movie must be TRYING to forget it, because the movie never stops affirming the fact that that&apos;s what they are. Fighting that battle while trying to enjoy a movie must detract a lot from the enjoyment.\n\nThis is a flawed but interesting and unusual movie, and I can understand why even the many positive reviews it gets have trouble describing it. It has been called a fairy tale because Francisco and Thomás seem to live in a dream world as cut off from the real world as Sleeping Beauty in her castle. But aren&apos;t all young lovers like that? Isn&apos;t that what love and hormones do to young people? Doesn&apos;t the rest of the world tend to fall away when the beloved comes into view? That&apos;s how it was when I was young.\n\nSo to say that this is a fairly tale is simply to say that it is a love story. It&apos;s an unusual love story, but fundamentally it is just like any other romance movie. If anything, its depiction of the all-consuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are, not less.\n\nOthers have emphasized the parents&apos; evident oblivion or even acquiescence to what is going on under their noses, but that seems to me like just another symptom of the irrational taboo I mentioned earlier. It&apos;s like: &quot;What those boys are doing is WRONG! Why don&apos;t their parents stop it?&quot; But, again, I ask: Why? Who is hurting whom? Nobody that I can see.\n\nWhen they&apos;re children, they simply love each other and love to be together, and they are freely affectionate with each other. Is that bad? Why? Should the mother slap her son when he kisses his younger brother on the head or puts his arm around him or holds him while they sleep? Why? Is fighting better? Is sibling rivalry better than sibling affection? Evidently it is to many people.\n\nNeither of those is what I see as a weakness in this movie. It&apos;s true that the movie is unreal, but what seems most unreal to me is not the brothers&apos; relationship with each other or with their parents. That&apos;s just an extraordinarily loving and mutually accepting family, which is almost never seen in a movie or in real life but should be everybody&apos;s ideal of what a family ought to be. If that&apos;s not the unconditional love people rave about nowadays, I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nWhat seems most unreal to me is the other adults&apos; relationships with each other, the fantastically loving relationships between exes and in-laws and friends who are NOT in love with each other, who are NOT caught up in the heady ecstasy of hormones and young love. That excess of affection is just plain weird.\n\nAnother weakness I see is in the dialog. The core story about the brothers is fine – it&apos;s a love story – but what people say to each other is stilted and awkward, not at all the way real people talk. It&apos;s like the way people talk in TV commercials. And the problem is not just in the English subtitles, which actually are very good: what they&apos;re saying in Portuguese sounds just as phony.\n\nAnd the final weakness I see is in the direction. The director seems to be trying to make something besides JUST a love story, but what that other something is never comes clear. It feels as if he is intentionally trying to make it an allegory, or an epic myth, or a ballet, or something else abstract that wrestles constantly with the extremely simple love story which the movie actually is.\n\nThe scene in which the adult brothers slowly undress for the first time as they face each other across the room is particularly strange, like something out of a kabuki performance. That obscure tension between what the movie is and what the director is trying to make it be doesn&apos;t ruin the movie, but it IS distracting.\n\nAll four actors who play the two brothers as children and then as adults are very good and very beautiful, inside and out. What the director did an EXCELLENT job of is getting straight actors (which I assume they all are) to be so convincingly loving toward each other. Every affectionate gesture, every touch, every loving look is totally convincing. That could NEVER happen in an American or Canadian movie, or even in a European movie, and I&apos;ve never seen it in any other movie from Latin America. It is a unique and astonishing accomplishment.\n\nThe director also gets credit for the movie&apos;s other great accomplishment, which is simply that it got made. A movie about love, passion, unshakable devotion, loyalty, innocence, tenderness and limitless generosity between two men is rarer than hens&apos; teeth. The scene in which they exchange wedding rings alone together at home is one of the sweetest, sexiest scenes I have ever seen. I have never seen any other movie that even comes close to the love between these two men, and I have seen hundreds and hundreds of gay movies. This is far from the best of them, but it is the most wonderful."

I&apos;ve been a fan of Ken Loach&apos;s movies for a long time but oftentimes I am not in the mood because I know I&apos;ll either cry or get upset (or both).\n\nTHE NAVIGATORS is different than his other films.  It isn&apos;t a movie where you cry and have the feeling of being emotionally raked over the coals (just saw the haunting SWEET SIXTEEN and am still having the aftershocks from that one).\n\nAnyway, THE NAVIGATORS is a movie that you watch and get angry.  For anyone working in a globalized economy (i.e., almost everyone) the ideas behind the railworker&apos;s plight -- how absolutely screwed they are -- is nothing new.  Yet I can&apos;t think of a movie that has illustrated this situation more clearly.  It&apos;s actually shocking that there aren&apos;t more movies about how altered our working world has became.  Possibly because this is such a current experience in the world today.\n\nTHE NAVIGATORS is a saga of working men, attractive, tough, garrulous, hard-working people who just want to work hard, make money, live their lives.\n\nI recommend the movie highly.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Black Belly of the Tarantula&quot; is a typically grandiose title in this genre of film known as the Giallo. Giancarlo Giannini stars as Inspector Tellini, a police detective on the trail of a killer. This killer is targeting the female clients of a health and beauty salon, and employs a particularly insidious method. They inject their victims with the poison from a rare species of wasp, and this poison thoroughly incapacitates them, so that they&apos;re unresponsive but conscious when they get carved up with the killers&apos; blade.\n\nGiannini is low key and likable in the lead role. His time on the job is contrasted with his more mundane home life with his wife Anna (Stefania Sandrelli), and it&apos;s actually what director Paolo Cavara *doesn&apos;t* do that makes this an interesting film of its kind. He doesn&apos;t concern himself with being overly stylish, instead opting for a slightly more matter of fact approach. Fans of this genre need not be concerned, for there is still quite a bit of female flesh to ogle and some bloody brutality to enjoy, but Cavara does an engaging job of combining the psychosexual proclivities of the maniac with a police procedural and a little bit of lightweight domestic drama.\n\nAll of the ladies just look ravishing, of course. Claudine Auger (&quot;Thunderball&quot;) plays salon boss Laura, Barbara Bouchet (&quot;Casino Royale&quot; &apos;67) is unhappy married woman Maria Zani, and Barbara Bach (&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;) is the receptionist, Jenny. Silvano Tranquilli offers a fine supporting performance as Maria&apos;s husband Paolo, who decides to play amateur sleuth when he falls under suspicion.\n\nGood pacing and a fairly tense finale help to make this a good entertainment, as well as a deliciously unconvincing dummy fall.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Mr. Roehrig seems to take him self a bit too seriously and it sounds like he was reviewing &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; as opposed to a fun film. Cast is great with Omar Miller who stars on CSI Miami and was in Miracle At St Anna. Jason Earles is also in it and my kids loved him from the Hannah Montana Show. Plot is fairly simple but if this film does not leave you smiling then you may as well hang out with Mr. Roehrig who wrote the other review. The message of &quot;Never Giving Up&quot; is through out the film and that is something we always teach our kids.\n\nI would rather watch this film 100 times then spend $100.00 to take my family of 4 to the movies to see some over produced, Hollywood spectacle with no heart. \n\nBuy Gordon Glass now!"

In fact, Falk is so annoying that Gazzo wants him dead, and with guys like these, the wish is usually father to the deed.\n\nAfter all ll the Mafia movies of the 1970s came the inevitable reaction in the late 1980s of mob comedies, and this is one of the best of them. Sociologically, these films marked the middle of the Mafia&apos;s decline. It seemed every mook flipped for witness protection and a book deal. Newer, more violent gangs were taking over the drug trade, Off Track Betting gutted the bookies, and Waste Management took over garbage collection. Organized Crime was still feared, and the legend persists, but the grandsons of capos now largely run legitimate businesses; they&apos;ve assimilated.\n\nJerry Lewis has a sizable role, and Lionel Stander is on view as an aging capo di tutto capi, as are Brenda Vacarro, Adrian Pasdar, and lots of shots of grungy outer boroughs and Atlantic City.",

Soon Gemma slips his treacherous escort and attempts to complete the mission himself.\n\nFort Yuma Gold is well-paced and full of action, with unpredictable plot twists, colorful characters, and one cringe-worthy torture sequence that will have you clutching your eyeballs!\n\nRough-and-tumble Gemma has quite a winning personality. His charismatic performance goes a long way in helping make this already breezy, likable spaghetti western very satisfying.\n\nThe music score, co-written by the great Ennio Morricone, is fantastic and quite reminiscent of the ones he created for A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More.",

      "name": "Michael Caine says it&apos;s his worst film. He&apos;s wrong - by a fair margin, too - though it&apos;s certainly a mediocre work.",
      "reviewBody": "Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was &quot;the only film (he) did purely for the money&quot; as well as &quot;the worst film he ever starred in&quot;. Hold on, Michael, weren&apos;t you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And weren&apos;t both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot). What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of Michael Caine. Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.\n\nDr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and he sets off on a continent-wide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East.\n\nAlong the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest. The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he&apos;ll never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving. All in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved.",

      "reviewBody": "Re-titled a &quot;Throw of the Dice&quot; (and appropriately subtitled &quot;A Romance of India&quot;) for American consumption, this late-term silent film was doomed to failure as it did not feature Greta Garbo or Charlie Chaplin in the non-speaking roles. But, its dreamy production values and international flavor played well in theaters not equipped for sound, and audiences in India were understandably receptive. The story begins in the Indian jungle, where pretty Seta Devi (as Sunita) has been secreted by a hermitic father.\n\nYou will immediately see that hiding the fetchingly-attired Ms. Devi from society isn&apos;t going to last because the area also serves as tiger hunting grounds for two ruling cousins - &quot;Good King&quot; Charu Roy (as Ranjit) and &quot;Bad King&quot; Himansu Rai (as Sohat).\n\nIn the opening hunt, the latter shoots the former &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot; with an arrow. The former unexpectedly recovers, due to the tender loving care provided by Devi. So, if he is to steal nubile young woman from Mr. Roy, Mr. Rai must take more drastic measures, which he does. The cousins&apos; mutual affection for gambling advances the plot to predictable results. \n\nIrony exists in the line, &quot;I know from your horoscope that gambling will bring you unhappiness.&quot; The film&apos;s main strengths are its beautiful locations, sets, and costumes. All of this will probably bore you, if you&apos;re not familiar with silent films.\n\n***** Prapancha Pash (8/16/29) Franz Osten ~ Seta Devi, Charu Roy, Himansu Rai, Modhu Bose",

Eugen and his three friends are determined to follow in mysterious Fritz Bühler&apos;s footsteps as the biggest rascals and adventurers of all times! Their quest for a long-hidden treasure and Fritz Bühler takes them from charming Berne into the mountains and to Zurich. The director has lovingly turned this well-known book into a beautiful, humorous, sweeping film full of funny little details with regard to story, effects and dialog. We kept laughing or smiling throughout the whole film. Characters, language and music are very Swiss!",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary is about a Buddhist monk setting up a monastery to help orphans and children in need in northern Thailand.\n\nThe film is a linear chronicle of events that happened over one year. The children are &quot;lost&quot; because they lost their parents, or simply because of their parents are too poor to raise them. In the beginning of the film, we see a mother giving up her son because she cannot afford to raise all her kids. She entrusts her son to Kruh Bah, a monk dedicated to changing the lives of others. In his words, he is a medium to pass on knowledge to children. Not only does he teach the teachings of Buddha, but also very basic things such as the importance of brushing teeth every day. The children also get to learn how to handle animals, and how to do so with respect.\n\nThe film is full of love and care. Even after some youngsters tries to pick a fight (using alarmingly long harvest knives) with him, he forgives and offers them jobs for a month, so that he gets to teach these youngsters what life is about.\n\nI think this documentary is inspirational. It portrays how life is like when every day is a struggle for survival. It tells me how life is in other parts of the world, where people are not as materialistic. It is a part of the world and a culture which I am unlikely to be able to experience first hand. Though the film is a bit slow, it is worth the watch!"

      "reviewBody": "Sweden in the 1100s is the backdrop for the troubled love story between nobleman boy-turned monk-turned-knight templar Arn and neighboring girl Cecilia- before he is sent off to Jerusalem in the crusades and she into a convent- plus the rivaling royal clan struggles for power in the nation. I haven&apos;t read the bestselling books which this is based on, and knowing this is a part-saga and soon TV-series to be, I can somewhat overlook the gaps in storytelling.\n\nWhat I do enjoy is a sound, intriguing (especially the scheming between the church and royal clans) and reliable medieval tale - with heavy doses of romance, monastery/convent dramatics and a little touch of &quot;Kingdom of heaven&quot;-battling in the end - that unfortunately never quite peaks. As a cinephile Swede, I know the country&apos;s market a bit, and notice that the filmmakers are SO focused on keeping a safe, steady course not to fail with such a big production ship like this, that they end up with no real climactic cinematic highlights to speak of. Rougher camera-work and sets might&apos;ve heightened things a bit?\n\nFor that reason it&apos;s very evenly paced, never boring and quite nicely produced. But with a major flaw: Arn remains very stiff and sketchy as an adult character. We never personally get to know him (he has SO few lines!) as to really understand why Cecilia loves him. \n\nAll in all, 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",

Very talented and brave leader of &quot;Singing group&quot;, he must look after some new cadets and fight together with them against the planes of Fascist Germany. Near to the Bogdan always are his friends, they all are from different parts of the country, but they all became real brothers. Very touching part of film is love feeling between Romeo and Masha. They both were pilots and their destinies were to live in sky together and die there, war took them to life&apos;s like a victim of eternal love. I think this movie about the greatest feeling in the world  about love, love to the native land, love between two people, love between friends and love to all cinema the greatest actor and director all over the world  Leonid Bykov.",

      "reviewBody": "Nicolas Bennetzen is an amateur filmmaker, whose debut feature GLIMPSE, shot for only 25,000 DKK, premiered on cable channel DK4 in October &apos;06. Bennetzen, well aware of his budgetary limitations, has wisely decided to avoid major special effects and large set pieces. The object was admittedly to use the filming process as a learning experience and prove that amateurs can complete a feature film on a low budget. The film is obviously inspired by Japanese horror movie hits of the late &apos;90es like RINGU, DARK WATER and JU-ON, replete with shots of dark long-haired Japanese chicks appearing out of nowhere. Director Bennetzen knows the genre conventions, which results in a moderately entertaining, but overlong attempt at a Danish psychological horror movie. Some judicious cuts might have resulted in a tighter and more effective film. Lead actor Eliot does a fine job, but the performances of the supporting actors are highly variable. For horror buffs, the film offers nothing new. Anyone who&apos;s ever seen a Japanese horror film will see the twists coming a mile ahead, but on its own terms, a worthy and respectful amateur effort that Bennetzen can take pride in and use as a guiding tool for future projects. Hopefully he&apos;ll come up with something a bit more original next time.",

An undercover cop in Pittsburgh, posing as a thief for the Mob, becomes attracted to the scintillating French woman who is hellbent on killing kingpin Robert Loggia (seems she&apos;s a bloodsucker by night--and forgot to &quot;finish the food&quot; the evening she put the bite on Loggia&apos;s Sal the Shark!). Not terribly bright, but full of puckish black humor and one exciting, masterfully staged sequence after another. And when things calm down a bit, as with the motel sequence between hot twosome Anne Parillaud and Anthony LaPaglia, Landis is adept at smoothly changing the movie&apos;s rhythm. It&apos;s an impressive, gory, foul-mouthed, yet adrenalized and satirical piece of work, Landis&apos; best. *** from ****",

      "reviewBody": "John Huston&apos;s love of Ireland and Irish country life was rather well known while he was with us. Any chance he had he took to be at his country estate there. What better than to shoot a film there even if the subject is 18th century Scotland and a notorious outlaws known as Sinful Davey.\n\nJohn Hurt is in the title role and he&apos;s a young rascal who deserts the army in a most spectacular fashion and takes up the outlaw trade. His dad was an outlaw who had some legendary exploits of his own and young Hurt wants to live up to his father&apos;s legend and even better it.\n\nNothing serious about Sinful Davey, he&apos;s just a good nature rascal who just follows his own beat. That the authorities take a dim view of stealing just shows what narrow minded folks they are. The only thing could stop Hurt is Pamela Franklin from his old village who is a good girl in a debauched age and she&apos;s determined he have a moral makeover.\n\nThis will never be classified as one of John Huston&apos;s better films, but it&apos;s entertaining enough. Besides the leads standing out in this cast is Robert Morley as the Duke of Argyll who rather admires Hurt and his unconventional ways and Ronald Fraser as Hurt&apos;s somewhat reluctant accomplice in his crimes.\n\nHave fun watching this one and don&apos;t take it one bit serious.",

      "reviewBody": "Bunuel doing an adventure movie is fine in my book. Why do people have to be such snobs when it comes to pigeonholing directors? Some of the films Bunuel made during this period, he may have been personally disappointed because he might have rather been making pix with subject matter more of his choosing. Nevertheless the things that Bunuel brings to this movie - the subtle deadpan humor throughout, the irreverent politics, the surreal touches (especially in the last third of the film when our fugitive protagonists are in the jungle) -- make this a gem. \n\nPlus Georges Marchal, Charles Vanel and Michel Piccoli are stupendous. And Signoret is in a class by herself. Not only was she one of the most stunningly gorgeous and sexy actresses in movies anywhere in the world in the 1950s, she was also a great actress and perfect here as the unrepentant, mercenary whore who falls in love. The last jungle sequence has some of the most beautifully surreal images in any film from the decade. The new DVD is highly recommended. A really perfect balance of elements.",

This year is a particular feast for the mother when the youngest, a somewhat promiscuous chap, announces that he&apos;s going to settle down and get married. And better yet, the eldest and most spineless of the brood discloses that he will be moving out of the country so mumsy will leave him alone once and for all. Will things turn out as planned? You&quot;ll just have to find out yourself when you watch this stylish, darkly witty, and perversely entertaining tale that could have been written especially for its star."

I&apos;ve always loved the character of nancy. For once we had a girl that was strong, determined and not some dumb bimbo. She doesn&apos;t run around falling every 2 minutes. She is a fighter. That being Said she is one of my favorite characters. And heather played the part wonderfully. She shows emotion, her acting wasn&apos;t wooden or over the top. I love this documentary. It&apos;s shows how heather is always in the shadows of Robert England &quot;Freddy&quot;. How the fans always want to meet Robert, how there are thousands of Freddy products but not really any nancy products. This doc is entertaining and funny. Plus the added bonus of the interview between heather and Wes cravens daughter. Which I thought was really interesting. If you are a nightmare fan and fan of nancy, do yourself a favor and watch this.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Junior Bonner&apos; was made in 1972 and set in a then contemporary Arizona; but in many ways, it is a true western. The real subject of most westerns was not cowboys and injuns, but the passing of an era; and in this film, about a star rodeo rider, this is typified by the contrast between his father (a man for whom the skills of the ring were also the stuff of everyday life) and his (prescient) brother Curly, hustling for his first million by selling real estate to easterners with no feel for the land. Director Sam Peckinpah is best known for excessive movies like &apos;The Wild Bunch&apos;, but here he plays a surprisingly restrained hand, and the film has a low key, believable feel. As often, Steve MacQueen (who plays the eponymous hero) doesn&apos;t really appear to be acting, but simply fits into his role. One thing that&apos;s interesting is how far away, to a modern audience, the world portrayed seems, now that the Curlys of this world have transformed the western states into America&apos;s fastest growing suburbs; and certain incidental details particularly bring this home: Junior enjoying a relaxing beer while driving, or even the fact that the leading character is called J.R. and his mother Ellie (dating the film to an era before &apos;Dallas&apos;). In fact, as westerns go, this one is unusually subtle and unromantic; but now seems as historical as any drama set on the frontiers of a hundred years before.",

      "reviewBody": "One wonders if the filmmakers knew what kind of a film they wanted to make. This movie starts out promising, with C. Thomas Howell as a kid driving across the great dusty southwest (beautifully and desolately photographed and eerie in a Stephen King-esque sort of way) on his way to California, only to be inexplicably pursued by a homicidal maniac, played with cold glee by the chilly-eyed Rutger Hauer.  There is a promise here of a psychological thriller a la Hitchcock, with Hauer seeming to have a near-supernatural and truly menacing presence. There is something inhuman and demonic about him, though it&apos;s hard to put your finger on precisely what. The relationship (yes, one can call it that) that develops between Hauer and Howell is interesting and deeply disturbing. Behind the enmity, they seem to have some truly dysfunctional need for each other, which makes the cat-and-mouse game all the more suspenseful. Unfortunately, somewhere around the middle of the movie, it degenerates into just another shoot-em-up action flick and Hauer&apos;s character seems silly rather than demonic, while Howell is just annoying. After about a half hour of this, I just wanted both of them to die. I didn&apos;t care anymore. Had the filmmakers known how to write (and direct) a satisfying, appropriate conclusion to the very suspenseful first half, this could have been a great movie. Instead, it falls on its face--and is all the more disappointing because we expected something better."

Although the English title of the film suggests there is some secret held by the grain, the only secret in Secret of the Grain is how Kechiche manages to seamlessly weld together into a cohesive whole such disparate elements as the traditions of great cooking, the problems immigrants confront when dealing with white authority, and the desire to leave a legacy to your children.\n\nSet in the French coastal village of Séte on the Mediterranean, the grain in the title refers to couscous, a diet staple of Tunisian immigrants and a dish that Slimane hopes to use to turn a dilapidated old boat into a profitable restaurant with his ex-wife Souad (Bouraouia Marzouk) doing the cooking. Shot with a hand-held camera that bobs and weaves through long takes of eating, animated dinner conversations, and emotional family disputes, the 151-minute Secret of the Grain has the authenticity you would expect if you accidentally stumbled into a Greek restaurant where an animated family dinner was taking place. In a scene at one of the two family dinners that take up half of the film, the length and variety of facial close-ups of people chewing, laughing, and talking in multi-cultural accents is staggering.\n\nThe centerpiece of the film is Slimane and his clan consisting of his two sons, five daughters, grandchildren, his ex-wife Souad, his lover Latifa (Hatika Karaoui), and her fiery twenty-year-old daughter Rym (Hafsia Herzi) who adores Slimane and whose energy and business acumen is the catalyst for his risky venture. Slimane, a man of sixty-one whose periods of silence stand in sharp contrast to the loquaciousness of his family, lives in a modest room in a weather-beaten hotel run by Latifa. A generous man, Slimane collects fish from his fisherman friends and delivers them each week to Souad, his older daughter Karima (Faridah Benkhetache); and Latifa.\n\nThe first hour delves into mundane family matters. When Slimane visits his eldest daughter Karima (Farida Benkhetache) to deliver some fish, Karima&apos;s anger at her three year-old daughter who refuses the potty dominates the conversation which continues for almost ten minutes interspersed with comments about the decline of the shipping industry. Other extended domestic scenes revolve around the escapades of Slimane&apos;s irresponsible son Majid (Sami Zitouni) whose extra-marital affairs threaten to drive his Russian wife Julia (Alice Houri) out of the family. The idea of starting a restaurant at age sixty-one raises much skepticism in the community and Slimane&apos;s plans are considered too thin and too unsupported by economic reality by the bank he asks for a loan.\n\nTo prove the worth of his idea, however, Slimane invites one hundred city officials, potential investors, friends and family to the boat that he, Rym, and his son Riadh (Mohamed Benabdeslem) painstakingly renovated. The opening night turns out to be an astonishing tour de force that combines life-affirming exuberance, sensual music and belly dancing, and an avoidable crisis that leads to heightened family tension and a suspenseful final half hour. Kechiche, a former movie and TV actor, has assembled an outstanding ensemble cast with first rate performances, especially from Boufares and Herzi. Though the film has many discussions about food, it is not a feel-good &quot;food movie&quot; but a complex, deeply intense narrative that elevates one family&apos;s personal struggles into a drama of epic scope.",

      "reviewBody": "Recipe: take one large dollop of Lord of the Flies, toss in a few heaping tablespoons of Southern Comfort, sprinkle with traces of Deliverance, and add The Most Dangerous Game to taste. Blend on high for 110 minutes and presto, you&apos;ve got a tasty treat of Wilderness, the new survival thriller by Director Michael J. Bassett.\n\nSet on a remote uninhabited island used by Britain&apos;s correctional services as a retreat for troubled youth, the movie tells the story of a group of juvenile criminals who get sent to the remote location only to find themselves being stalked by a trained killer bent on revenge.\n\nScreened at the 2006 edition of Montreal&apos;s Fantasia Film Festival, the movie doesn&apos;t make much effort to conceal the identity of the stalker. In fact, most viewers can figure this out in the first 15 minutes. However keeping secrets isn&apos;t what this story is about. Rather, it&apos;s about the thrill of hunting humans, the most sophisticated predator on the planet, and the diverse and innovative tricks involved.\n\nFeaturing Sean Pertwee, who seems to own a clause in British movie contracts saying he will appear in every UK thriller/horror film under production, the film showcases the talents of a young cast of unknowns who, while not demanded of Shakespearean performances, nonetheless turn in flawless performances to round out the movie.\n\nBassett, whose previous directorial debut was 2002&apos;s intriguing but flawed Deathwatch, seems to have found his stride with this effort. Scenes appear carefully thought out and executed, with a nice attention to detail. He clearly understands how to pace a film of this nature, and what works and what doesn&apos;t in what clearly was a demanding shoot involving attack dogs, forest chases, fires and numerous stunts.\n\nThe movie has something for every fan of the genre; beheadings, vicious forest traps, maulings, being eaten alive, crossbows, knife fights, skinheads, near drownings, the list goes on.\n\nViewers can add this to the ever growing list of British horror films such as The Descent, Dog Soldiers, and 28 Days Later (to name only a few) that are currently setting the world standard for delivering quality cinematic chills and thrills.",

      "reviewBody": "There are already several comments left, but what the hey, I liked this movie and I&apos;m gonna have my 10p worth.\n\nBefore I mention the movie itself, I&apos;d better comment on modern Asian movies that reach Western shores, and the fact that they have different pacing, priorities and styles to what you would see at the cinema. The fact that a lot of people don&apos;t &apos;get&apos; the parts of this film which seem to have no relevance is probably as much due to the difference in culture more than any wrongdoing on the production team&apos;s behalf. The same can be said for a lot of Hong Kong comedies, the &apos;humour&apos; which would probably illicit a wry laugh back home flies miles over everybody else&apos;s head.\n\nIn that sort of circumstance, I&apos;ve developed a good trick, I switch-off trying to figure out what all these little hints and gestures mean and concentrate on the character interactions and the scares. I&apos;ve had a lot of practice, Western cinema in recent years has been guilty of &apos;rambling&apos;, and they&apos;ve got no such excuse as &apos;cultural differences&apos; ;)\n\nAnyway, the movie! (good grief!), the plot&apos;s already been explained and probed, so I won&apos;t go into that. What this film has is a constant &apos;pressure&apos;, a claustrophobic atmosphere which persists regardless of the location. Clever camera work afoot! The palpable distance which the heroine feels from her family and the people around her (perhaps a symptom of not being able to communicate non-verbally with them so long? Perhaps not, but it&apos;s there) is always there too. You get the impression that she could be surrounded by a crowd and still walk alone from one side of a city to the other.\n\nThe smaller roles are played out very nicely, great acting considering the film concentrates almost solely on the two main characters.\n\nThe ending is a little bit of a let-down, predictable and not entirely &apos;working&apos;. But, BUT, it isn&apos;t a catastrophe which ruins the film, which I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know what I mean. The ending of a film is what you&apos;re left with when you switch off the TV, and if it&apos;s bad, then so is the film.\n\nThis movie is the only one in recent years which actually gave me a start, and that&apos;s something. Real horror isn&apos;t about dripping guts and hooks with heads on them, it&apos;s about the unexpected, it&apos;s about being confronted with something terrifying, something which makes you wish the character was elsewhere. In order to achieve that, you need to give a damn about the character in the first place, which is where 90% of cheap horrors fall down. Not here, the characters are likable and have a little childlike innocence about them, you want to get in there and slap the more unpleasant visitors :P\n\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed watching this film, and intend to buy it when I find it for a pittance (almost all DVDs can be found for the right price at one time or another, shop around and ask people where they get their bargains). I would heartily recommend renting before buying, however. As several have mentioned already, there are several elements of this film which seem to have been deliberately copied from recent films such as Sixth Sense. If that prospect leaves a sour taste, I&apos;d look elsewhere, but everyone else who hasn&apos;t had enough of all that yet should certainly have a look :D\n\nThanks for reading."

      "reviewBody": "An interesting homage to &apos;Vampyr&apos; that pretty successfully recreates the Dreyer classic&apos;s otherworldly lethargic mood as well as the peculiarity of its dialogues and their delivery but to achieve all this it adopts a glacial pace that almost makes &apos;Vampyr&apos; look like it&apos;s on speed in comparison, combined with its paper-thin plot and carefully enough staged but very minimal mise-en-scène that doesn&apos;t exactly dazzle the senses this ought to be the death blow to this quiet two-character piece, but I found its strangeness compelling enough to actually make this surprisingly easy viewing for me.\n\nLike &apos;Vampyr&apos; it begins with a man arriving at a house to find the front door locked so he walks around the house to enter from a different side. Inside he meets a woman. Plotwise the similarities largely end here apart from a couple of incidental moments and locations. The man has come to purchase the house but the woman keeps avoiding the subject and doesn&apos;t want to name a price, she generally seems absent-minded (to put it mildly) so the guy quite naturally keeps hanging around in the house for days and he gradually finds out sinister things about her husband who is nowhere in sight. Or is he? &apos;Nachtschatten&apos; is a mood piece through and through built on the motifs of &quot;Todessehnsucht&quot;, &quot;Liebestod&quot; (sorry, translating those words just seems wrong to me) and all that good Gothic stuff with a strong emphasis on the (German) Romanticism part of it, but almost without any use of its symbolism, a brief but crucial &quot;gravestone dream&quot; being the major exception. Instead it looks more like a Heimatfilm, or rather like the shadow of one, like, if this is a Heimatfilm then it&apos;s one that died decades ago and now its ghost flickers on a TV screen at 3am inside a dream.\n\nAs technically competently made as it is in its own way the film suffers from a lack of ideas, I found its narrative as empty as its mise-en-scène and even the little substance/narrative it has is certainly at the end of the film blatantly spelled out but it really is more than just alluded to again and again throughout the whole film. Like I said, mood and strangeness is king, this is no twisty horror, it&apos;s easy to figure out the whole thing in the first 10 minutes and the rest of the film one watches the characters catching up with you. And that IS a problem, what is a film like this worth if there is absolutely nothing mysterious left? It&apos;s not that the scenario actually makes logical sense but the background story does and I just feel it would have profited from being more puzzling rather than having the viewer be ahead of the characters throughout much of the film.\n\nIt also has a very sparse but I think carefully put together sound design and music is used seldom in the first half and more frequently in the second half. I think it&apos;s noteworthy that this piece of music (it always uses the same one again and again) sounds a lot like the &apos;Mulholland Drive&apos; theme. You know, this soft droning that is sinister, melancholic, sad, and a few other things all at once. It doesn&apos;t fail to be effective. I also should mention that while, like I said, far from visually dazzling, it has a, to me, appealing and appropriately odd desaturated 16mm look.\n\nMaybe the complexity actually is all there and it just failed to resonate much with me. Maybe it resonates more with stand-alone widows who when their husband passed away died a little (or a lot) themselves. So I guess I recommend &apos;Nachtschatten&apos; to lonely, morbid widows, most other viewers should probably stick to &apos;Vampyr&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Set in the Victorian era, a mad genius named Robur (Vincent Price) has devised a futuristic flying ship for a devious, slightly contradictory, though possibly admirable purpose. He travels halfway around the world with an imprisoned quartet and a crew of &quot;air sailors&quot;.\n\nAlthough there are some problems with this film primarily due to its budget, and some viewers might be put off by the obvious similarities to Disney&apos;s version of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954), I enjoyed this somewhat wacky sci-fi/fantasy/adventure film quite a bit, and gave it a 9 out of 10.\n\nThe film actually opens with a brief but clever, tongue-in-cheek black &amp; white documentary about the history of flying machines. Abruptly, at the narrative line &quot;Master of the World&quot;, the documentary ends. Then we change to color as we&apos;re taken to a sumptuously fantastic Pennsylvania town, complete with towering mountains and a seeming volcano.\n\nI have to admit that director William Whitney already had me in the palm of his hand at that moment. I&apos;m all for weird transitions, surrealism and beautifully saturated color cinematography. To make things even better, just as a character tells us how boring the town is, a booming voice (obviously Price&apos;s), quoting a doom-laden passage from scripture, emanates from the vicinity of the mountain.\n\nI was also easily sold on the film because I&apos;m a big Vincent Price fan. Price is great, even though the context of the role is a bit unusual for him. There is a lot of comic relief throughout most of the film, and the genre wasn&apos;t his norm. However, he comes across as menacingly demented yet suave as always. The rest of the principle cast was marvelous, too, with Charles Bronson playing an early version of Harrison Ford (maybe he always did that), Mary Webster as an appealing love triangle target, and some very fun and appropriate overacting from Henry Hull doing an early obnoxious &quot;I&apos;m an American&quot; shtick and David Frankham as the perpetually irascible Victorian sap.\n\nIt&apos;s a blast noting all of the future tech elements from past eras&apos; perspectives, and the set design and special effects are actually admirable given that this was a low-budget film for its ambitions. Even the stock footage and footage from the 1944 Henry V (the shots of London that look like a medieval town), although at times obvious, are incorporated well. On the other hand, there is some similarity between the set design and that of a particular era and class of television show--say the Adam West Batman, the original Star Trek, or even the Tom Baker Doctor Who--which all have a fairly low-budget look, but I have to admit that I love those shows, too.\n\nThere isn&apos;t much of an easily discernible subtext in the film, but of course that&apos;s because Master of the World wears its messages proudly on its sleeve. I won&apos;t state them explicitly here, as in my view that would be a spoiler, but it&apos;s notable, like many other aspects of the film, for its similarity to 20,000 Leagues, including its moral ambiguity. This would actually be a good film, as would 20,000 Leagues, to show a freshman-level ethics class as an exemplification of and discussion launching pad for both utilitarianism and deontology.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s not exactly the most original film to come down the pike (but primarily just because of 20,000 Leagues), and it&apos;s not a faithful adaptation of author Jules Verne&apos;s work, I don&apos;t subtract points for either of those characteristics. Master Of The World has an engaging, solid story that is both thought provoking and a lot of fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Having just bought the DVD and finished watching it, I thought that it was a respectable effort and defiantly deserved 7 stars.\n\nWhen I looked at the first review written about 3000 miles, I was shocked and damn right annoyed. I&apos;m talking about VinventVega Who gave the film one star and then proceeded to rant about how bad it was. Let me tell you, it&apos;s not bad. It gives a good depiction of the Gumball experience. To all fans of the Gumball rally they should defiantly see this film. In comparison to the other Gumball films, it&apos;s on the same par as Gumball 3000: The Movie. If your a hardcore fan of jackass or anything related to Bam then you should see this too!\n\nVincentVega made 6 points to illustrate why he has a personal vendetta against this film. Addressing the points I will give my opinion as both a fan of Gumball and Jackass related franchises.\n\n1) The direction (if you can call it that) is nowhere to be found.\n\nWell the direction of the film is that you go from A in London to B in L.A. In between A and B is all the driving, stunts, crazy antics and skating. The film clearly documents were they are going and what country they are in every time they get to their checkpoints. Remember Vega, This is a documentary which means that it is not scripted, so its direction is dynamic.\n\n2) It&apos;s badly edited.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the editing. Back that up with a cross reference. \n\n3) The soundtrack is worse than that of any random porn movie.\n\nI find the soundtrack to be random, because I can not associate it with any specific genre. The music is upbeat and flash. How you can associate the music with a porn flick is your problem.\n\n4) The little dialogue there is, is inaudible either because the soundtrack is still playing at full volume (see: badly edited) or because the in-car engine-noise is too loud.\n\nComplaining that there is little dialogue is just such a dumb thing to say. This is not scripted; this is real life, what the hell do you expect? Bam reading the works of Shakespeare. When Bam, Tony and the crew aren&apos;t doing anything too exciting they are talking to the cameras, filling the viewers in with what is going on. There is enough dialogue in the film for you to understand and enjoy what is going on! As for not being able to hear people talking at times, I can only account for this once. I couldn&apos;t hear Ryan Dunn very clearly because the windows of the car were down. The footage was probably added to the movie because what he said was witty. And for complaining about the noise of car engines... Simple answer, you can hear over the engine noise. Dumbass\n\n5) The bits that are audible make it abundantly clear that the cast are more talented skaters than comedians. Also, their contempt for the fans lining the streets is despicable.\n\nThis comes down to taste. Having been a fan of Bam since the beginning of the CKY videos and a fan of Tony since the Pro Skater Games, I have always enjoyed what they have had to say. By saying such an ignorant thing like that makes you sound like a miserable old sod. They are not comedians but that doesn&apos;t mean that what they say is not funny, because in my opinion quite a lot is funny. About the comment with the fans, You can only say something like that with Bam, who is actually fed up of little kids coming up to him and asking him for photographs, autographs and what not. He might not want to do them but he still does. When kids are pounding on the windows asking for photographs, if he signs one... then has to sign all of them! \n\n6) For a movie about a 3000-mile road trip, you would expect some nicely filmed driving action. There is none.\n\nThere is plenty of good driving action. There is some brilliant footage of the Gumballers driving through the Nevada desert among other places.\n\nBeing a fan of Gumball and jackass, this film was a hit for me. This film deserves a 6/10 at least! Don&apos;t let irrelevant reviews deter you from watching this film!",

Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film. However, things start to fall apart in the last act as the story goes off in some bizarre directions. Yet for a cheesy horror film, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty entertaining."

      "reviewBody": "I can make absolutely no sense of each and every one star review which calls this film horrible as well as the 4.7 rating. It is unfathomable to me. The cinematography alone should warrant a rating of at least 5. \n\nThis is a subtle religious horror flick that I have to assume people rejected because of the lack of scares and gore. However, the performances, direction and cinematography are all top notch. Though Lost Souls was marketed to look like a demonic scare-fest, I would compare this film to the likes of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. In fact, I would not be surprised if the makers of that film borrowed quite heavily from this one, both in style and effects. \n\nThe premise is relatively simple: A small religious sect believe the coming of the anti-Christ to be near, sitting dormant in a human body. \n\nThe biggest praise that I can bestow upon this film is that over 12 years later, this film still looks like it could have been made yesterday. In fact, it looks uncannily more modern than a large majority of recent horror efforts. Lost Souls simply does not age. \n\nAnother popular factor in why this movie is so poorly rated and received is the fact that audiences just did not like the ending. I feel sorry for those that do not. The ending is original, and though it did not satisfy blood thirsty Hollywood horror fans, it is very much appropriate for this film. To put it simply without spoiling anything: faith is the central core to Lost Souls, those with it and those without. That is what this ending plays off of, and I think it&apos;s perfect. Please do not let any of these negative reviews divert you from seeing this film. \n\nThis is not End of Days or Stigmata. Lost Souls is not camp in the slightest. It is a dark, beautifully shot and well acted film that is significantly ahead of it&apos;s time. \n\n7/10",

His friend Dr. Frank Meyers (Peter Brown) works in the Fallbrook mental institution and was a great friend of his father. He helps Nick since he lost his father. When Dr. Meyers is found dead in the clinic after committing suicide, Nick does not believe and decides to investigate his death. He goes to Fallbrook as if he has amnesia and is interned in the clinic. Soon he finds that four patients are missing and his further investigation shows that all of them were suicidal inmates. He also discovers that the dangerous criminal Dr. Sullivan Rane (Malcolm McDowell) is hidden in the clinic. What is happening in Fallbrook?\n\n&quot;Asylum (1997)&quot; is an entertaining low-budget thriller by James Seale. The plot is not original but well written, with funny moments and good performances. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Limite da Loucura&quot; (&quot;The Limit of the Madness&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Soul Survivors reminded me a lot of Jacob&apos;s Ladder, but it doesn&apos;t have the foreboding mood or the suspense of the latter. A girl gets in a car accident and suffers a brain hemorrhage of sorts, which results in her going through some nightmarish experiences. Is she dead? Is she alive? We don&apos;t know until the end, and despite some artistic visual flourishes, Soul Survivors never seems to really take off. It doesn&apos;t generate any real suspense or give us any real scares. But it is not a total failure, either. Director Steve Carpenter has given us a film that seems to play the notes of psychological horror, but doesn&apos;t quite manage to play its music.",

      "reviewBody": "I have lived in the Los Angeles area for about a year now. When I can, I enjoy seeing free screenings of movies. As I understand it, these test screenings are done by marketing-research companies at the behest of the movie studios. You watch a movie for free and then you fill out a form explaining what you liked and didn&apos;t like about the movie. The company then selects a smaller group of viewers for a Q &amp; A focus group.\n\nSo I saw a free screening of A SOUND OF THUNDER about six months ago. We were told that the special effects were just &quot;mock-ups&quot; and therefore to not judge those effects too harshly. And we were promised that for the actual release the special effects would look spectacular.\n\nI just watched A SOUND OF THUNDER on its opening Friday and the special effects were EXACTLY the same. They used the mock-ups, the &quot;pretend special effects,&quot; for the release.\n\nWhich leaves me to believe that the test screenings got such bad feedback that the studio decided to cut its losses. They didn&apos;t advertise this film very much and they didn&apos;t spend any REAL money on the special effects.\n\nOne thing they may have changed was some of the editing. The pace felt a little better than the original free screening. I mean the movie has a lot of problems but it seemed like some small things were cut or at least cut differently.\n\nI&apos;m hoping that the DVD will have a commentary track so we can hear the behind-the-scenes story of what really happened. But I doubt the studio will put any bells and whistles on the DVD release.\n\nI agree with everyone else. This is a bad movie (with the exception of Ben Kingsley&apos;s interesting character work). But it was made worse by the studio&apos;s lack of commitment and backing."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a known fact that Devika Bhagat&apos;s screenplay is an adaptation of Jane Austen&apos;s &apos;Emma&apos;. The trailers gave the impression of another silly Yashraj movie but seeing the cast and the fact that it was based on a Jane Austen novel, I wanted to give it a shot. Phew, it&apos;s definitely not as bad as the Yashraj fairy tale garbage. However, even though I enjoyed &apos;Aisha&apos; it could have easily been better.\n\nWith the exception of the wedding and engagement sequences, most of the time &apos;Aisha&apos; felt too western. They could have Indianized it a bit more. I&apos;m not saying to completely traditionalize it as it&apos;s important to show Aisha as an arrogant spoiled brat who loves modern fashion but there&apos;s no need to make the film look like a fashion show of western outfits. Also, the commercialization of brands was sometimes too in-your-face. In addition, a few sequences have been lifted off Amy Heckerling&apos;s &apos;Clueless&apos;, especially the scenes with Shefali. Moreover I felt that the ending was rushed. I would have liked to see more development of Aisha, Shefali and Pinky post the &apos;breakup&apos;.\n\nAmong the good points is that &apos;Aisha is fun to watch. The music is superb. The comedy works very well. There&apos;s hardly a dull moment. The chemistry between most actors is just right. Beautiful looking Sonam Kapoor shows tremendous improvement as an actress since her awkward debut in &apos;Saawariya&apos;. The performance may not be stupendous but she&apos;s competent and proves to be a much better actress than most of her contemporaries. Abhay Deol doesn&apos;t have a large role but he lights the screen with a natural performance when he appears in a scene. Ira Dubey, Cyrus Sahukar and Amrita Puri are brilliant. Lisa Haydon doesn&apos;t overdo her sexbomb colleague character. A stunning Anuradha Patel is a treat to watch. Anand Tiwari is wasted.\n\n&apos;Aisha&apos; is a decently made film. I found the settings quite confusing and inconsistent. Some scenes were filmed in India and others abroad while there was no mention of such. The cinematography is average and the editing at times felt patchy but not to the extent that it ruins the entire movie. &apos;Aisha&apos; is no classic but it&apos;s entertaining."

If John Kerry can indeed change America for the better then getting this and similar films screened on a mass scale would be worth adding to the list of changes needed.  &quot;The Trip&quot; begins and ends innocently touching your mind.  It does this first by getting you to care about the characters, to like them or to loathe them, and then by the inclusion of David Mixner (ingenious) and Jill St. John (watch the extra features on the dvd for some of her FUNNIEST work!). Their appearance adds flavor and spice to a fresh young cast including the very talented Steve Braun and Larry Sullivan.  I was engrossed in every moment.  I believe it helped that many involved were, in some cases, re-living some of their own life moments (read: writer/director/exec. producer Miles Swain). Well made, touching, engrossing. What more could a director- ask for? It almost gives you the same feeling as &quot;Big Eden&quot; but without the scripted ending. Kudos, and thank you Miles."

They indulge themselves in an artificial food as they enjoy their technology oriented world. However,Robi&apos;s life turns upside down as they decide to go on a cruise for some long overdue vacation time. Unfortunately, when the cruise ship gets caught up in a storm, Robi finds himself in a modern day(by modern I mean 1976)Robinson Crusoe story. \n\nI saw this movie for the first time, back when I was 9 years old. Recently, I managed to stumble on it in a video shop. After all these years, this movie still can stand as one of the funniest that I have ever seen. Very enjoyable, satisfying comedy. If you manage to get your hands on a copy, check it out. All around a good comedy movie.",
