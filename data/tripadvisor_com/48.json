It truly is an amazing building and impressive how they're climate neutral. This state of the art building has set impressive standards for arenas down the road. It was also extremely nice to get to go to the team store and shop with no one there. Our tour guides Collette and Heather were delightful and well informed. If they didn't know an answer, they called and asked to find out. I can't recommend this tour enough!!!"

Our concierge works with you to define each dining experience. On the day of the event you show up, you group eats, and you leave.

Chaufføren, jeg tror han hed Les, fortalte mange oplysende historie om de lokale forhold fra før i tiden så vel som nu. Vi kom ud på Alki Beach som jeg slet ikke var klar over fandtes. Ligger over bugten overfor selve Seattle. Et fantastisk view af byen og et fantastisk Strandmiljø. Det var desværre stadig lyst helt til slutningen af turen men alligevel fantastisk. Vi kom rundt i mange lokale kvarterer. Virkelig en tur der er pengene værd."

Never operated an electric bike before but if you know how to ride a conventional bike and you can flip a couple of levers to change gears, use the throttle and hand brakes, it’s a breeze!\n\nSpeaking of breezes, we had great, sunny weather so the mountain (Ranier) was out/clearly visible. We started in downtown near the water, headed over to the houseboats (passed by the Sleepless in Seattle one), next over to the Freemont Bridge, past Troll Street, toured Gasworks Park, a cool nearby neighborhood, St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, Capitol Hill and back through downtown to complete our approximate 14 mile, 3-hour tour.\n\nMonty gave great bike instructions, helpful city, neighborhood and historical information - and led us on and off the many bike lanes and streets effortlessly and safely.\n\nSuch a great way to see Seattle and bond with family and friends!\n\nBook it!"

    "description": "Tour includes Lowercase Brewing, Jellyfish Brewing company and Elysian Brewing Taproom.\n\nFounded in 1851 Georgetown is arguably Seattle’s oldest neighborhood. By the 1880’s it became the sixth largest beer producing district in the world and the center of Seattle’s early brewing industry. Now, with many of its 19th Century buildings still intact, Georgetown has experienced a revival as a hip neighborhood in a city of hipsters. Georgetown is now an important hub in the Northwest’s craft brewing community and a pretty cool place to have a beer.\n\nAt each brewery our Cicerone certified Beer Guide will lead a guided tasting of four, 4-once beers, for a total of 12 different beers. This is about 3 pints of beer. \n\n* 3/4 of a mile, 1,500 steps\n* Each guide a certified cicerone\n* 12 different 4 oz beers\n* Free 4-oz souvenir tasting glass\n* Free souvenir Bottle Key-Chain opener\n* Beer & Food Pairing Guide",

Not to say, the takeoff from Seattle which is one of the most beautiful cities from the top I have ever enjoyed.

You see around Lake Union, the floating houses, house boats, boat yards and the narration is very informative.

I went last week to their offices and spoke to their coordinator and he said, my voucher was still valid. \n\nA few days later the same person told me that they can’t accept my voucher because it’s expired. So they went from it’s still valid to it’s not longer valid. \n\nI would have used it before but Covid was thing... really unfortunate, them bouncing back and fourth, what horrible customer service. \n\nOn top of that they never answer their phone hence I had to go in person and talk to someone. \n\nAlso, the cruise is not worth $33 more like $20. \n\nDisappointing experience."

    "description": "If you have just 1 day to dedicate to seeing the absolute best that Seattle has to offer, this is the tour for you! We'll spend the morning exploring Seattle's top city highlights including the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, the Chihuly Glass Museum, Kerry Park and Lake Union. In the afternoon, we'll escape the city and you'll get an amazing taste of the spectacular scenery that surrounds Seattle. At the foot of the Cascade mountain range, we'll stop for lunch in a quaint historic railroad town, feel the mists from thundering Snoqualmie Falls, and then cruise along a country road to the heart of winery country, where adults will enjoy a complimentary full wine tasting flight! \n\nYour group of up to 14 can start and end their tour anywhere in the greater Seattle area! Cruise terminal, Seattle hotel, Sea-Tac airport--it doesn't matter. Loaded with too much baggage after your cruise? We've got space for 20 suitcases so you don't have to worry about it!",
