      "reviewBody": "This is actually quite a complex movie. Not the fragile plot of a school teacher desperate for love, the complexity comes in the characters themselves. Shirley MacLaine as the stressed teacher desperately tries to juggle with looking after her children, mentoring the teenage assistant and fighting her conscience which is constantly being sexually challenged. Laurence Harvey comes across as barking mad, but there&apos;s one short scene in the movie which explains the torture he&apos;s going through, a scene vital to be seen for the whole film to make sense. Jack Hawkins, trapped in an unhappy marriage is probably mis-cast although he is a good contrast to Harvey. Not a typical depiction of New Zealand but an unusual movie, great for discussion &amp; debate.",

      "description": "American Anna Vorontosov teaches in a rural school on New Zealand&apos;s North Island. Her class of younger students is comprised largely of Maoris. She feels that western methods are not the most appropriate in teaching her students, for who concepts such as &quot;see Jane run&quot; have no cultural context. She wants her students to &quot;feel&quot;, from love to pain to joy, and as such her classes are outwardly disorganized and chaotic. Her livelihood is potentially threatened with the arrival of a new senior inspector of primary schools, a Brit name William Abercrombie. To make her classes seem more organized to Abercrombie, Anna enlists the help of one of the older students, fifteen year old Maori, Whareparita. Anna&apos;s students, including Whareparita, see her as their guardian angel. Anna&apos;s burgeoning friendship with Whareparita may show her that although she has her students&apos; best interests at heart, she may also not fully understand the culture within which she now lives. Teaching is her life, which leaves no time for men, sex about which she has repressive views. These views affect her relationship with two very different men who fall in love with her. The first is fellow teacher, Paul Lathrope, a brash Brit. He is a lost soul with self-destructive tendencies. The second is married Abercrombie himself, whose marriage is albeit unsatisfying and long-distance.",

But don&apos;t expect a splatter-fest - it&apos;s not. This is low budget indie at its absolute best. Lack of budget is more than compensated by superb scripting and performance. This is what really sets it head and shoulders above the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; indie crap that continually oozes out of the film festivals. \n\nDespite it&apos;s age, it is as pertinent as ever and stands up to regular repeat viewing. If you ever get a chance to see it, do so - but also note, the less you actually know about this film, the greater your experience will be. Definite keeper.",

Why can&apos;t they make zombie films like this in the United States instead of rubbish like Resident Evil (which parts of this movie were taken from). Junk (like Score) was partially shot in English. I love this movie and I know you will to.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nGeorge A.

      "reviewBody": "Before rewatching this movie on YouTube, I watched a 9-minute short called Life with the Flying Cadets which was basically a trailer for this film as it shows many scenes from it especially the ones with stars Abbott &amp; Costello. It basically told of the value of those men training to fly for whatever awaits them. Now Keep &apos;Em Flying was the second A &amp; C movie I saw as an 11- or 12-year-old kid in 1979 when it showed up on TV late Saturday night on &quot;The Abbott &amp; Costello Theatre&quot; which was devoted to showcasing all their Universal product. The first was Hold That Ghost. Anyway, here Blackie (Abbott) and Heathcliff (Costello) are associates of daredevil flyer Jinx Roberts (Dick Foran who had also appeared with Bud and Lou in In the Navy and Ride &apos;Em Cowboy) who all get fired from the fair and they all swear off women but then they go to a nightclub where singer Linda Joyce (Carol Bruce) is performing her last engagement before going to the USO. Of course, Jinx is smitten with her and ends up working near her at a cadet training center. Blackie and Heathcliff follow and encounter two waitresses at a cafe there but since they&apos;re twins-Barbara and Gloria (both Martha Raye)-and they don&apos;t appear together when they all meet, confusion reigns! I&apos;ll just now say that this was even more funny now than when I first saw this all those years ago, that&apos;s for sure! I especially thought that routine in which the Abbott character tells the Costello character to not make any orders since they&apos;re short on money and he&apos;s offering to share his order only for Costello to renege quickly because Abbott keeps insisting he order something was much better than a similar routine Laurel &amp; Hardy did in Men O&apos;War which was my last review before this one. Speaking of L &amp; H, the producer of this picture was Glenn Tryon who was previously an actor who, among his earlier appearances, was in the short 45 Minutes from Hollywood which was the first time Stan &amp; Ollie were in the same Hal Roach short-having first previously appeared together in The Lucky Dog for another company-though they missed actually being together in that one. And if the names of Carol Bruce and Martha Raye are familiar to you, you probably saw them in their later years during the late &apos;70s when Ms. Bruce had a recurring role as Mama Carlson in &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; and Ms. Raye likewise had such a role as Mel Sharple&apos;s mom in &quot;Alice&quot;! A few more things about this movie: I thought the moving torpedo and the standing-on-the-wing-of-a-flying-plane sequences involving Lou were partly convincing enough to me to excuse the obvious use of moving background projection (it should be noted that Pat, Lou&apos;s brother, was the stunt double for these segments), that the serious parts of the Jinx storyline was fine with me, and that the musical interludes were entertaining enough especially Carol and Martha&apos;s &quot;The Boy with the Wistful Eyes&quot; number. So that&apos;s a high recommendation of Keep &apos;Em Flying. Oh, and continuing my reviews of A &amp; C and L &amp; H doing similar movies, my next one will be on the latter&apos;s Our Relations in which Stan and Ollie have their own set of twins encountering mistaken identity...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Landscape After Battle&quot;: This excellent Polish film was shown in its home country in 1970 (but only released in the United States in 1978 by New Yorker Films), one of an impressive resume by the Academy Award-winning director Andrzej Wajda, who was presented with a lifetime achievement award by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999, an honor that was well-deserved, highlighted by among other great films such as &quot;Man of Iron&quot; (1981) and &quot;Katyn&quot; (2007). Several of the previous reviewers said that Wajda&apos;s talent can only be appreciated if you are Polish; NOT true! Instead, his work shows how mainstream European films are, by and large, head and shoulders among contemporary American output.\n\n&quot;Landscape After Battle&quot; begins on the snowy day a Nazi concentration camp is liberated by American troops in 1945. Personally, I found the use of Antonio Vivaldi&apos;s &quot;Winter&quot; movement from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; to be a stroke of genius; it never would have occurred to me to utilize it within the score, and it works in the scene! Also, bravo to Mr. Wajda for actually filming winter scenes in winter . . . proved by seeing the actors&apos; breath while filming outdoors! It strikes me that he didn&apos;t much go in for fake stuff, which American directors don&apos;t seem much bothered about.\n\nThe plot is simple: a sarcastic prisoner, Tadeusz (brilliantly portrayed by Daniel Olbrychski, cynical in the style of the late James Dean), whose passions are books and writing poetry, begins a tentative relationship with a mysterious girl (Stanislawa Celinska), first seen at a huge outdoor mass celebrated by visiting church hierarchy. The script is multi-layered with statements about Poland&apos;s national pride, its fervent Catholicism (90-plus % of the population professes to be practicing believers), the unwillingness to forgive, and fear of Communism, and the supporting cast is populated by a varied assortment of interesting characters. The protagonist, Tadeusz, prides himself on being an outsider, and there is not a false note in Olbrychski&apos;s performance; it is difficult to not take your eyes off him. Supporting in a moving portrayal is actor Zygmunt Malanowicz, who made an impressive debut as the young hitchhiker, catalytic in provoking the strained marriage in Roman Polanski&apos;s first feature, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (Oscar nominee, Best Foreign Language Film, 1963). Malanowicz plays the young priest with a sense of intense sadness, especially regarding the degrading parading of a German thief (female) in front of her mob of accusers, and in the final scene with Tadeusz at film&apos;s end, describing an atrocity he witnessed first-hand in the camp. In my opinion, Malanowicz is among the best of Poland&apos;s acting community, and this performance is first-rate.\n\nThe exquisite color photography by Zygmunt Samosiuk is masterfully beautiful, some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in cinema, particularly the beginning winter frolic by the freed prisoners, and the conversation among the striking colors of the autumn woods between the young couple. Samosiuk makes great use of the countryside&apos;s natural beauty . . . even something as commonplace as the wheat fields. Many of the shots are breathtaking. Also, the use of hand-held cameras to derive a sense of spontaneity and intimacy at certain points is very effective.\n\nThe film is controversial and upsetting but, considering the facts on which it is based, these attributes work in Wajda&apos;s favor. One is supposed to be shaken and there are lasting impressions left. I would highly recommend &quot;Landscape After Battle&quot; as a must-see experience for serious audiences who appreciate important European filmmaking.",

      "reviewBody": "When viewed from afar, &quot;Life Show&quot; does well at probing problems (the socioeconomic chasm between rich and poor, the displacement brought on by &quot;progress&quot; of those who were in its way, the improved since Communism (yes, you read that correctly) but still relatively low position of women in society, and the desperate situation of rural workers who come into China&apos;s big cities) central to the &quot;New China&apos;s&quot; meteoric rise from destitute poverty to semi-prosperity. It also accurately shows the power of &quot;guanxi&quot; (personal connections and favor-trading) in Chinese society, played out in Shuang Yang&apos;s ploy to win a dispute over the ownership of an apartment by matching one of her female employees to marry the manager of the Records Bureau&apos;s presumably autistic son. Considering its low budget and the fact that most of this film was shot on a set, the visuals were impressive, displaying both the drabness of modern China and its unique, semi-perverse beauty, occasionally discoverable within its endless expanse of hastily constructed buildings, concrete, and smog. I particularly enjoyed the scenes shot in the cable car over the Yangzi River that distinguish the film as taking place in Chongqing, as opposed to China&apos;s innumerable other metropolises, and communicate both the visual richness and blandness simultaneously present in nearly every Chinese urban area.\n\nThis film far surpasses many of its Chinese peers in both TV and film in its attempt to &quot;tell the truth.&quot; Many present-day Chinese productions showcase a lifestyle of gated communities, spotless skyscrapers, luxury cars, and American consumption patterns, a lifestyle that all but the top 1% of the top 1% of Chinese people can only imagine because they have seen it on TV or pirated DVDs. To its credit, &quot;Life Show&quot; largely avoids this fantasy world. Perhaps due to an adherence to the novel that spawned the film, &quot;Life Show&quot; deals with its central issues (see above) in an ostensibly honest fashion. Unfortunately, when you get down to the actual details, this film begins to fall apart. Despite the effort apparently made by the set designers towards realism, certain things, such as the food stand and Shuang Yang&apos;s apartment, are multiple times too big, and too clean-looking beyond all believability. However, the lack of realism in the details of this film seems mainly a consequence of casting Tao Hong as Shuang Yang (the female lead). Although Tao Hong is one of my favorite Chinese actresses because of an elusive quality she has (I haven&apos;t quite figured it out yet) that somehow makes her stand out from other Chinese actresses, I feel she was poorly suited to this role because she could not / did not perform a transformation similar to that of Charlize Theron in &quot;Monster&quot;, namely that of discarding the bulk of her charm to play a character well beneath her in social status and grace. Judging by the dialogue and Shuang Yang&apos;s occupation, selling duck necks as street food, Shuang Yang should have been played as the very definition of &quot;su&quot; (a Chinese word roughly meaning &quot;the opposite of elegant&quot; with a semi-derogatory connotation halfway between &quot;the masses&quot; and &quot;poor white trash&quot;), as her lack of education and refinement is mentioned numerous times, especially in her conversations with Zhuo (the male lead). Having lived in China for two years, I have come into contact with hundreds of street vendors and small restaurant proprietors and seen thousands more on my walks through the streets. These types of eating establishments without exception are dirty places, with some even bordering on squalid, and their proprietors generally appear friendly but weathered, street-smart and not often bathed. Yes, we are told numerous times that Shuang Yang has &quot;benshi&quot; (the kind of talent that makes one successful), but that simply does not equal the grace and beauty that Tao Hong cannot dispose herself of in playing this role. Shuang Yang&apos;s face and nails should be dirtier, her hands should be roughened up, and her hair shouldn&apos;t be colored. She shouldn&apos;t be dining at a 20th floor luxury restaurant teaching her employee girl how to eat pizza with a knife and fork (since Chinese not of high social status typically do not know how to use a knife and fork). We should see the filthy water in which Shuang Yang dips the rag she uses to wipe the counter. While she is on the job, Shuang Yang should spit, as Chinese of lower social status commonly do. Can you even imagine Tao Hong spitting? I would laugh! Even that would probably be graceful. Ultimately, Tao Hong is far too attractive for the character she is playing. Food stand proprietors in China just don&apos;t look like her. EVER! (nor do 40-year-old Floridian prostitutes look like Charlize Theron w/o the age-producing makeup and the fat suit).\n\nI cannot entirely blame Tao Hong for her performance in this movie or definitively call it poor acting on her part, mostly because I suspect she was just working with the set design and direction she was given (and what woman would want to look unattractive?). I understand nearly that every film includes some &quot;dressing up&quot; of its subjects to add interest, or for other reasons. However, I just wish everybody involved in the production of this film would have placed more value on closely emulating the style and substance of those whose plight they were trying to portray. This film could have been powerful, but in its over-elegance, ironically settles for the film equivalent of &quot;su&quot;. (******6/10)",

      "reviewBody": "2 stars for Kay Francis -- she&apos;s wonderful! And she didn&apos;t deserve this horrible tripe that Warner Bros. threw her way! \n\nThe two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. Kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband she&apos;s going to the movies. The hubby&apos;s biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby&apos;s ear that Kay&apos;s not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. Now here&apos;s the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based: \n\n1) the judge tells the jury that if it&apos;s determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) \n\n2) the hubby&apos;s lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that it&apos;s all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn&apos;t gone over to the actor&apos;s room, then her husband wouldn&apos;t have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she&apos;s the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place.\n\nI can&apos;t even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you&apos;d never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from pre-code Kay roles and real-life spitfire Kay Francis.\n\nSteer way clear of this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery; also good are Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s other great Kay flicks as well, but I&apos;m only mentioning the ones I&apos;ve seen and can recommend.)",

From the cars to the clothing to the ubiquitous Coca-Cola bottles, everything adds to the feeling that these events could have taken place. It, of course, also helps that he has actors who look like they fit the time period. Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall, John Schuck and Bert Remsen were born to play these roles, and they get able support from Tom Skerritt and Louise Fletcher.\n\nInstead of a typical soundtrack, Altman uses vintage radio programs to underscore the action (crime dramas during robberies, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; during a love scene). It&apos;s a brilliant gamble that pays off and takes the film to a whole new level.\n\nIn short, this is one of Altman&apos;s most fully realized films. For it to remain unseen is a crime.",

      "reviewBody": "Several reviewers have criticized this film for its moral/ethical bankruptcy. They point out that if film crews were at the Golden Gate Bridge monitoring jumpers and filming them (often from multiple cameras), they could have done more to prevent the tragedies. If you take that approach to watching this film, you will certainly be offended.\n\nBut I don&apos;t believe it was the intent of the filmmakers to make any sort of moral/ethical statement. Rather, they simply present us with an eye through which we see what happens in the world. It&apos;s no different from a National Geographic special which tracks a leopard stalking some unsuspecting gazelle and the bloody carnage that ensues. Should the camera crews be criticized for not warning the gazelle?\n\nOK, enough of the ethical debate. Chances are, if you&apos;re prepared to see live footage of people jumping off bridges, you won&apos;t get too bent out of shape at the underlying morality (or lack thereof). Let me just say that it was tastefully done--or as tastefully as you can do a subject like this.\n\nInterviews with well-spoken, competent individuals added a refreshing, &quot;scientific&quot; approach to this highly emotional subject. Yes, family members and close friends are interviewed, but (unlike Fox News et al) we don&apos;t get the hysterical, weepy ad hominem clips. Instead we get very lucid and enlightening insights as spoken by the people who knew the victims well. Overall, it presents a compelling point of view, far more provoking than the usual &quot;suicide is evil, and all suicidal people are losers&quot; mantra which we often hear. If you are a psychology student or if you are in some way familiar with severe depression, this is a great film to watch. It documents the last hours of those who have truly gone to the extreme of mental anguish. This subject has been taboo for centuries, and I&apos;m not quite sure why. But I&apos;m glad to see that films like this are bringing it into the open.\n\nMY ONLY CRITICISM: While most &quot;jumping&quot; scenes were handled well, there are a few which I found a bit tacky. This was due to the camera work being a bit too greedy. When the individual climbs onto the ledge, suddenly we see the camera jockeying into position as if to get the best view of the fall. Sometimes the overzealous camera operator jumps the gun and pans down to the water far ahead of the body. This comes across as just a tad bit bloodthirsty. But hey, I guess I&apos;d get a little excited behind the lens, too.\n\nBut really that&apos;s a minor criticism. In contrast, I have to praise the film for being professionally done, even with a decent musical score (not too sappy, not too sterile). But really it&apos;s the objectivity and lack of obvious bias which makes it a great documentary, something which Michael Moore could learn a lot from (sorry, someone had to say it). Also, just because it&apos;s a documentary, don&apos;t expect that it&apos;ll be linear and boring. The filmmakers were very adept at weaving suspense and an underlying drama which culminates with a truly stunning climax at the end. I must applaud this film on both an academic and an artistic level.",

In 2004, Walker is assigned to capture his former partner Lyle Atwood (Jason Schombing) that is manipulating the stock market in 1929. Atwood tells that he is working for Senator McComb, who is a powerful politician that is running for president. Atwood prefers to die and does not confess that McComb is a criminal. Now Max knows the truth but McComb is changing the past and Max does not know how stop him.\n\n&quot;Timecop&quot; is a highly entertaining film, despite the clichés and the inconsistencies. Most of the scenes are written to explore Van Damme´s skill with fights. Ron Silver performs his usual villain roleand is very effective.

      "reviewBody": "In the late 1970&apos;s, FBI agent Joe Pistone poses as jewel expert Donnie Brasco to win the trust of ageing mob middleman Lefty Ruggiero.  As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob, rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.\n\nNow that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid-90&apos;s when I saw Arizona Dream, Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months -I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre - the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper, is suspected, gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story, it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go, but it manages to rise above the clichés by having some very good characters and emotional themes.\n\nThe whole gangster thing works and is gripping, but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going `native&apos; when undercover has been done plenty of times, but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp&apos;s great performance that makes it work well here; we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob, or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy - he is a middleman, taking the risks, doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot (which itself is also very good).\n\nDepp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn&apos;t really rank up their with his best - he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it&apos;s dues.  Pacino is of course, wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen, Kirby, Ivanek, Heche, Miano and others all give good support, but it is Pacino and Depp&apos;s film - which is a good thing.\n\nOverall, the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but, while I was watching it I wasn&apos;t really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the greatest and most crafted works of the incredible Mani Ratnam. I was stunned by every moment of it and the very first scene was enough for me to get completely hooked. Mr Ratnam&apos;s ability to make a grandiose love story and yet keep it starkly realistic is just unbelievable. It makes the viewer believe that true, intense love does not exist only in fairy tales, but in real-life too, with simple and ordinary people. Dil Se is a rare gem of its times - authentic, hard-hitting, gripping, and deeply involving. Some people have deemed it a bit slow and tedious, but according to me the film moves at a steady pace and is totally focused, engaging and captivating.\n\nThe film&apos;s concept: a young, hard-working radio broadcaster falls in love with a mysterious, strangely apathetic woman who is actually a terrorist may have been tackled before by filmmakers around the world, but none has done it the way Mr Ratnam did. He directs this feature with heart and soul and intensifies it with complete mastery, so much that you cannot leave the screen even for one moment (even if you are one of those who prefer skipping the songs). The script is grounded in tension and mystery, and it thankfully avoids sentimentality. And then we also have some genuinely real yet exceptional dialogues, which bring forth a poetic quality that eases the serious proceedings.\n\nEvery artist involved in this film gives one of their best. A.R Rahman, for one, creates one of the most crafted and beautiful movie soundtracks of his career, giving so much life and essence to the film. The songs flow incredibly well with the film, they never feel unnecessary, they fit the situations, and ultimately enhance the narrative and contribute to the film&apos;s mystery and intense atmosphere. &quot;Dil Se Re&quot;, &quot;Jiya Jale&quot;, &quot;Chaiyya Chaiyya&quot; and &quot;Satrangi Re&quot; - each track is a gem and showcases the greatness of Rahman and Ratnam, who visualises them exceedingly well on-screen. This of course could have been done without Santosh Sivan&apos;s brilliant cinematography.\n\nThe performances are top notch. This is one of Shahrukh Khan&apos;s most accomplished and realistic performances. He is intense, witty, vulnerable, believable and convincing as Amar. He portrays a suffering man who would go to any strengths for a woman he hardly knows, and though his character&apos;s unconditional love may seem peculiar, he manages to keep it real and balanced. He conveys his feelings, whether it&apos;s sorrow, love, pain or anger, in his own inimitable style, using his troubling intensity and nervous mannerisms. One can really feel for the pain in his eyes, which is evident every time he meets this woman who keeps rejecting him. A superb act.\n\nManisha Koirala, one of the most talented dramatic actresses India has seen, is flawless as Meghna. She smiles barely once in the entire film but her expressive eyes and silence speak volumes and always do the job. It&apos;s a natural and ambiguous portrayal of a woman who has lost belief in life and love, or at least of someone who compels herself to think so. She brilliantly displays the little nuances which let us sense her constant fights with herself and her struggle to not submit to her feelings every time she faces the bright side of the world, forcefully and firmly fossilising herself for the sake of a mission which must be completed.\n\nPreity Zinta, the star herself in her debut film, does something very few actors have been capable of doing: she makes a great impact despite having a very small role. It&apos;s a great achievement for any actor to excel and make a lasting impression with a role of such minimal importance and screen time. She is natural, vibrant and very likable, commanding the audience&apos;s attention with her strong screen presence and lively persona. She&apos;s always been known for her ability to add happiness and positivity to films which are overly serious and dark, and this one is no exception. Her full of life, frank and direct Preeti is one of the most unforgettable characters in recent years.\n\nDil Se is a socially relevant movie but it is a love story at heart and there it scores the most. It may not appeal to all kinds of audiences (in fact, it was a box office failure in India, though a success overseas), more because of its brutally honest depiction of terror and national battle, yet it remains thoroughly fascinating. The film is atmospheric, dark and deep. The only aspects that abstract the viewer from these features may be the energetic music and Preity Zinta&apos;s light character. In anyway, it is a picture of great artistic excellence, and I would recommend anyone to see it. The ending is also most unpredictable, only making it more beautiful and memorable.",

      "reviewBody": "I finally saw William Castle&apos;s PROJECT X the other night and I was surprised by the story-line. It reminded me a lot of JOHNNY MNEMONIC or THE MATRIX and the whole cyberpunk genre of films or books. PROJECT X is seriously outdated because of the FX and the boring and cheap production values, which makes this movie look like a standard 1960s TV movie. But the story itself screams William Gibson: it&apos;s about retrieving some memory from a spy (played by Christopher George) who&apos;s suffering from amnesia and who might have the information about Asia&apos;s attempt to destroy the West. The amnesia was artificially induced in the spy by someone in order to prevent the information from reaching the authorities in the West. When the film starts, the spy is incased in some coffin-like chamber and he&apos;s in suspended animation. Scientists revive the spy and try to get that memory from his amnesiac mind with a holographic device that can see inside the man&apos;s mind when he&apos;s sleeping. The scientists also recreate a &apos;virtual reality&quot; setting that looks like something from the 1960s where the scientists hope the spy will be duped and eventually hand them the missing memory (the spy knows a lot about history, which is the explanation for the elaborate set-up. It&apos;s also cheaper this way. No expensive futuristic sets. LOL!). Of course, someone tries to botch the scientists attempt to save the world. The story is filled with details like biowarfare, overpopulation, infertility, etc. The identity of the spy is repeatedly changed by the scientists, who keep referring to these new virtual personalities of his as a MATRIX!\n\nJOHNNY MNEMONIC is basically an unofficial remake of PROJECT X. In JOHNNY MNEMONIC, the whole world is suffering from some sort of condition called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome. Keanu Reeves has information implanted in his brain (which has a chip) that could cure NAS. Keanu got this implanted info in Beijing and he only has 24 hours to bring the vital info to the scientists in the US. William Gibson basically reworked the ideas found in PROJECT X and updated them for JOHNNY MNEMONIC. For instance, In JOHNNY MNEMONIC, the world is already suffering from something and the cure is from Asia. In PROJECT X, the threat is from Asia and it&apos;s some sort of virus/biochemical/nerve weapon. And the action in both stories are governed by some sort of limited timeline.\n\nWhile watching the film, I had a vivid sense of deja vu. The whole idea of advanced technology capable of controlling memories, and the &quot;reality vs virtual reality&quot; aspect seen in PROJECT X are the basic ingredients of the whole cyberpunk genre. PROJECT X was very familiar and yet, thanks to the look of the movie, very outdated too. As a movie, PROJECT X is not that good but it&apos;s interesting to see where the whole idea of memory manipulation started from.",

I saw Seed of Chucky, Child&apos;s Play, Bride of Chucky, child&apos;s Play 2 and then Child&apos;s Play 3. Seeing as though this was the last that I watched. I really was into Chucky and I thought it was a great addition to the series, yes it&apos;s a bit &quot;out there&quot; but that&apos;s what&apos;s good about Chucky. I&apos;m not particularly into the military thing but this movie made me appreciate it that bit more. I think it is good how it shows Andy still hasn&apos;t gotten over his phsycological problems and that he is still terrified of his old best friend. I liked this one better than the original and I love the lines that Chucky says. For those who don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good movie, I understand because I didn&apos;t enjoy it the first time I watched it but now that I have seen it more I love it!!"

I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood, due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that as Foster first enters the gate of the cemetery, he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate, where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1970, Satyajit Ray was already one of the most respected filmmakers ever with string of movies to his name which placed India in the world map. He has received more accolade than any other Indian filmmaker. I know many cinephiles considered Ray&apos;s Trilogy or rank his earlier films to the best while the latter half can be seen as a pessimistic phase. For me, it is the best period with top notch scripts, surrealism, fresh with thematic depth which was not present in the creator&apos;s earlier films. I rank Jana Aranya (1975), Days and Nights in the Forest (1970), Nayak (1966), Sikkim (1981) in the top shelf.\n\nI&apos;m a detractor of these new wave/parallel films capitalising on poverty with lame storyline, cliched character arcs, with no room for surrealism. I can&apos;t connect fully with the graph of films at that time and also with the Carnatic music which was like a matter of privilege with access only to a certain community. Nothing against the music but rarely someone outside the community gets to access it. Also, it was a time when lot of hippies visited India with short and departed with long hair, they benefitted a lot from the sadhus in India and Pakistan. Drifting from the green power crowd to the city, it was filled with lonely, depressed, politically correct/incorrect, rebellious, aimlessly wandering people. Ray interweaves the mood of the 70s with avant-garde aesthetics of experimental filmmakers, typical of the 1960s, especially in the opening negative sequence, the mirror shot and the climax with the skeletons.\n\nAt the center of the plot is Siddhartha Chaudhuri, a modern youth, unemployed, rebellious, and free. The film follows him and his dreams where he tries to scrape together everything to make a living. The city is inhospitable, with each day passing he dives into paranoia more and warps himself in an ever-descending spiral where it does not seem like there is any hope.\n\nThere&apos;s a scene in Pratidwandi (1972), where the character goes through an upheaval during a job interview. He is asked to answer many questions, and this is my favourite.\n\n&apos;Who was the prime minister of England at the time of Independence?\n\nTo which he replies - whose Independence, Sir?\n\nThe sequence shocked me, and I was in silence along with mention of Vietnam war, Moon landing. I could almost feel his pain with no atonement on the horizon. What&apos;s even scarier is the relevance the film holds portraying the present situation right.",

The excitement, love, and fun that was put on the screen entertained me way beyond the typical mega-budged blockbuster. Congrats on a wonderful creation. Emily, please keep &apos;em coming! You are a very talented young lady, and also very blessed to have such supportive parents and friends.\n\nAs much as I loved the movie, I found the commentaries joyful as well. The actors obviously had great respect for you, and with good reason. The amount of work this took is staggering to myself, an adult. Heck, even taking the time to post this little note is about all I find myself having time for.\n\nThe whole cast turned in really fun performances, but the stand out actor is young Tiger Darrow. If she&apos;s not in either a major motion picture or a buzz-worth indy film (whichever she chooses) before she&apos;s 18, I&apos;ll eat my keyboard.\n\nAs for other people trying to decide if they should order the DVD, if you like encouraging the next generation, if you enjoy stories told across a dinner table, if you like zombie movies, or if you think you&apos;d like to see a young talent on the ground floor this is the DVD for you. And it&apos;s really cheap, too! No price gouging here, no artiste pricing. Best of all, when Emily is a big name director, you will have the sweetest privilege ever...being able to say &quot;Oh yah, I&apos;ve know about her for years&quot; to your out of touch friends.\n\nThis project is truly a testament to the wonders of the modern age, not the showy ones, but the personal ones, and Emily M. Hagins is showing us the world inside our door.",

The story takes place in the 1920&apos;s in Budapest, and tells a story about Ede Minarik, the laundry man, who is keen to sacrifice his life, wealth, even his family life to make up his own football team, which can make it to the first division. But the film is about more than just football: it shows us the post-war Budapest, the dirt, the slums, the poverty, and a man, who has a dream, a vision to achieve his own set goals with his team. At that time there was a desperate need for lots of people like Minarik. What is unique about the movie is how it was pictured: the cameraman created an atmosphere which takes us back to the 1920&apos;s. Definitely worth watching it!",

The subject of bigamy is unusual for a Hollywood movie of that era and is handled in an intelligent, compassionate way.\n\nEdmond O&apos;Brien convincingly portrays a traveling salesman in love with two women -- his cute, barren, career-minded pre-feminist wife (Joan Fontaine) and a lonely, stunningly beautiful waitress (Lupino) -- neither of whom know of the other&apos;s existence. \n\nThe direction is excellent and elicits beautifully nuanced performances from the entire cast. O&apos;Brien is portrayed as a decent human being who becomes entangled in a romantic triangle and tries to find a viable solution for everyone. Unfortunately, his well-intentioned plan to be a loving husband to both women comes unstuck when a nit-picking adoption investigator (Edmund Gwenn) probes too deeply.\n\nAlthough not classic film noir, there is some sharp, insightful dialog. For example, the courtroom scene effectively challenges traditional American values when the judge sympathetically remarks: &quot;If you had simply taken her as your mistress instead of marrying her, you would not be here now.&quot; \n\nThis is a well-crafted and provocative movie that showcases Lupino&apos;s considerable talent as an actress, director, and student of human nature. Ida Lupino was an extraordinary woman, years ahead of her time. Enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "Some people should remember that the world is geared to the individual, and so it is, &quot;to each his own&quot;. I thought that Exit in Red was a thrilling and exciting movie. I loved the way they started in the middle, and went back and forth in the movie telling different parts until at last, we saw the whole stinking mess as it began and ended. The plot was believable, those two lovers had led a life of conning, why was it so incredible that she would be able to manipulate men as she wanted, that was the way she had grown up. Why couldn&apos;t a psychiatrist get bamboozled? They&apos;re just people!! Intelligence doesn&apos;t stop people from being stupid when it comes to predators. All types of people, from wealthy and rich, to wealthy and lonely have fallen for this scenario, jeez!! Don&apos;t you watch any of the shows on A and E, like Forensic Files. or Cold case files? It happens over and over. Smart seeming people getting hoodwinked by con artists. Ed was just lucky enough to have gotten out of it, with a bit of help from his lawyer. And don&apos;t fool yourself that cops are any less vindictive than Vollers was towards Ed. Some cops are sons of bitches, and I&apos;m talking real life. How many stories have we heard of people serving years and years in prison, then being found innocent due to new technologies? Oh, it happens, buddy!! You are just closed minded, I, being an African-American, have heard of stories that make &quot;Exit in Red&quot; sound like real life, to me. Except that in the reals, the lawyer killed the two cops that were coming to get her client, and they ran away to Mexico, and didn&apos;t get caught until 6 or 7 years later. He was acquitted, and she went to prison. Sounded like drell, but it was true, and she was white and he was Latino!! Man, you must live in some fantasy world if that movie sounded boring to you. You just don&apos;t like one or the other of the actors, and that&apos;s hella okay. Yet, I am 58 years old, and let me tell you, if they made some movies out of the stories that I know to be true, you would turn the channel before they got to the &quot;kicker&quot; that made the story worth telling! I know that this is a &quot;free-for-all&quot;, we all have the right to express our opinion, and I&apos;m totally all for that, have at it. That&apos;s why I take this time to say, &quot;I loved this movie&quot;, it&apos;s like that old T.V. show I used to watch when I was a much younger TV addict, &quot;there are over a million stories in the Naked City, and this has been one of them&quot;. Well there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of movies out there, and honey, this was only one of them! So, you didn&apos;t like it. So what? Lots of us did.",

The pictures are beautiful the music is very well chosen and wonderfully performed. Sometimes the plot is a little &quot;scatchy&quot; especially for those who are not really expert in Chopin&apos;s (or Madame Sand&apos;s) life, but mostly follows the real history (e.g.the gray haired man, hanging around half drunk in Nohant is happen to be Hippolyte Chatiron, half brother of Sand). In spite of some rather primitive solution (the Russian brutes,the plastic eagles in Majorca...)the balance is definitely positive thanks to such delicate and subtle scenes as e.g. Madame Sand in the kitchen wiping her forehead, Chopin, coming home late at night, his walk in the alley and then - one of my favourite - meeting Jan, their conversation then Jan, watching his master, climbing upstairs...or the scene with Albert (Grzymala)and the discussion of Solange&apos;s marriage...or the last meeting of the angelic Maestro and Madame Sand (actually it happened so !) - really beautiful and delicate.Thanks, pan Antczak !",

Also, I read the story years ago but still remember it pretty clearly - this is a kinda sorta adaptation since the King story is included, but it&apos;s a story within the story (his was not all that good to begin with) and it is pretty much covered, but it&apos;s too bad it&apos;s a passing reference and not better connected to the story since it&apos;s supposed to show how they don&apos;t care/go mad with &quot;Captain Trips&quot; virus all around them...I&apos;m aware people who haven&apos;t read it won&apos;t notice but those of us who have will. Nevertheless, the story was watchable and extremely good for a low budget film. Watch out for this director and cinematographer, they will be going places.\n\n Final verdict: On par with the story, so check out both.\n\n Overall: 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The film&apos;s concept: all adults who have recently lost a partner through death or divorce are sent to a hotel, where if they do not fall in love within 45 days, they are surgically transformed into an animal of their choosing. &apos;&apos;A lobster&apos;s a great choice&apos;&apos;.\n\nI try not to explain the film&apos;s plot when somebody asks, so as not to completely dissuade them from viewing. Maybe this ridiculous concept is in reference to how ridiculous forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests is, or even just forcing someone to eventually get married, a practice common in the modern world. A comment on the societal pressures put on single adults. There are constant references and reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. There is a further commentary on applying limiting labels and boxes to people, bisexual not being an option on the sexuality question, no half-sized shoes.\n\nCollin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the many minor characters, all add to the film greatly. There are no weak actors which I could point out. The screen writing can be fast and witty at times, but I felt the &apos;&apos;quirkiness&apos;&apos; was definitely overdone. The robotic and monotonous speech pattern was generally funny but also overdone.\n\nI have spoken to many people who do not enjoy this film, and I can definitely respect and understand their opinion. The Lobster is not for everyone, with it&apos;s strange plot, writing and imagery. It&apos;s script is similar to that of a Wes Anderson film, but still remains very dark, and at times, disturbing. It is without a doubt, a slow film, heavily reliant on dialogue (which many people won&apos;t even find funny).\n\nI would recommend the film to people who enjoy quirky films such as Frank, Juno or The Grand Budapest Hotel, although The Lobster is definitely darker than those examples.\n\nProbably one of the strangest film I&apos;ve ever watched.",

      "reviewBody": "A group of med students spend the weekend fixing up an old house.  Of course this was the site of a horrible massacre, and of course there is going to be a new slaughter this weekend with the med students on the menu.\n\nI love horror movies frankly, so the plot of this movie doesn&apos;t exactly bother me.  The slasher genre is the only one that can get away with using the same plot over and over again in my book.  The problems with this movie is that once you move from the plot everything else is awful.\n\nThe character are written and acted like they come right out of a sitcom. ( one girl acts just like &quot;chrissy&quot; from THREES COMPANY)  The actors are also very bad, but you can&apos;t blame then so much.  Yes they can&apos;t act, but the script didn&apos;t help much.  The dialogue is outright ridiculous.\n\n The Gore is really unconvincing,  and this looks to be filmed on video. Not that is uncommon today almost all horror movies ( and independent movies) are filmed that way now.  But we have digital video,  they have a 80&apos;s camcorder.\n\nThe movie also seems to be a showcase for Steven Baio, like every scene was structured to make him the focus even though he is not the main character.\n\n What this film does have going for it is it&apos;s parallels to SCREAM.  Some scenes are very similar.  It does have one decent murder to it as well.\n\nAs bad as this movie is, I have to say there is something about it that made me rent it 3 times.  of course it is because I found it to be hysterical, ( there is even a a spur of the moment dance number that had me on the floor crying from laughing) but hey,  it put money in the producers pockets so I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t care why I watched it.\n\nReally bad ( 4/ 10)"

AUTOMATED HAT-MAKER AND SAUSAGE-GRINDER comes off as something Melies would do as two men crank their machine to deliver what the title offers. AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER&apos;S is a decent little comedy as a man getting his picture taken but he can&apos;t sit still long enough for the thing to be taken. DANCE OF THE SEASON is a rather &quot;adult&quot; film for 1900 as a woman does a little dance while (fake) snow falls on her. THE LANDLADY has a group of kids ringing the bell of a landlady then running off. Then a man comes up and rings it but this time the landlady has some water for him. This group of films once again feature a mixed bag from director Guy as we get some items that were clearly meant to copy other films from other studios. AVENUE DE L&apos;OPERA is pretty good in terms of these gimmick films that everyone was releasing back then. The entire gimmick of running the film backwards was certainly a lot more entertaining back then than it is today but it&apos;s still nice. AUTOMATED HAT-MAKER is a straight comedy but one can&apos;t help but see more magic would have been worked by someone like Melies. AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER&apos;S is a decent comedy for its time as we get the annoying man constantly messes up the plans of the photographer. DANCE OF THE SEASONS is perhaps the most interesting film here as there&apos;s a brief sequence where someone, using a stick, holds out an attempt at a copyright notice but who knows how well this worked back in the day. The woman&apos;s dress is also hiked up pretty high, which I&apos;m sure didn&apos;t sit well with many people back then you felt the movies were dirty entertainment. THE LANDLADY is yet another comedy that really didn&apos;t feature that big of a pay off or enough of a laugh."

      "name": "a shaky, low-budget, Dennis-Hopper fueled above-average curio, though not a &quot;classic&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "If looking on the DVD cover that is provided by Troma (yes, that old chestnut) - and by this I mean the *new* sort-of remastered uncut DVD version released last year, not the much lamented previous version that looks like hell- you would think that you have been missing out on something really special for your whole cinematic life. How has one not seen a mid 70&apos;s Aussie-Western (also one of the very first Australian film distributed in the US) which stars Dennis Hopper as a mad bandit going around the Queensland colonies in the 19th century donning a fake beard and shooting (mostly) those who he deems deserve a killing? It could go either way: it could either be the case where it is a suppressed classic just waiting to be unearthed, or it&apos;s a piece of Aussie trash given some prestige above its other Ausploitation films due to its star. Ultimately, the movie is somewhere in the middle, though it tries to be a classic when it can, and sometimes can&apos;t help but be kind of trashy due to its budget.\n\nIt&apos;s protagonist is something of an icon in Australia, like their Billy the Kid (sadly I&apos;d yet to hear of him until this film), who started out as just an Irish farmer who enjoyed his opium, but ran away from a massacre of the Chinese in the area. He then got put in jail for one hold-up, got tortured and raped in prison, and then got out to try and become normal again, only to get shot and get healed by an aborigine. If this sounds like something interesting so far, it is. But the only downside it&apos;s at this point that the film finally takes off, after the first half hour; it&apos;s not that the opening half hour is bad in the slightest, since the cinematography by Mike Molloy is always something cool to look at in widescreen anamorphic. But the pace is kind of jerky and shaky, going from one set-up to another with a jarring feeling. This happens at other points in the film as well, but not as much as at this part.\n\nAnd yet, as just noted, when Morgan is shot and heals up with the aborigine (a very natural David Gulpilil), he then decides to fight back. In a way he becomes an outlaw since he&apos;s left with no alternative, but at the same time goes for it for all it&apos;s worth. He especially attacks the upper class, those who have lots of money and land, and he becomes the big target for the police and authorities in the area, garnering a 1,000 dollar reward. It&apos;s here we get to see the big bad Dennis Hopper becomes as Morgan, and the film takes on a quality that is kind of special: it&apos;s a western, but it&apos;s also an anti-western. It&apos;s not about how Morgan is just some amoral villain going around to rob and maim and kill. His terms of being criminal are partly for survival (not too oddly enough one of his old prison &quot;buddies&quot; goes after him now as a member of the local authority), and partly to stick it to &apos;the man&apos; circa 1860 Australia. We see the people who should be taking Morgan out as being, appropriately for the time period, not very sharp: one of their goals once they get kill Morgan is to study his skull to see how primitive he is.\n\nIt&apos;s this, actually, that Philippe Mora latches on to. How primitive a life does Morgan lead as an outlaw? His main compadre is an aborigine, who is barely looked on as human by the people in charge in the Aussie area, and as he keeps going along he&apos;s more at peace in an odd way with his fate. He knows how lucky he is to get *this* far, and he becomes more of a bad-ass because of it. He&apos;s a solid anti-hero, and Hopper makes the movie as awesome as it can get. He has a look about him- yes, even with that fake beard like something out of Cannibal the Musical- that is a little frightening, but also kind of sympathetic and sad. There&apos;s a scene where his Morgan is in a house with a woman, and she basically offers herself to him sexually, and he just softly speaks about how he just can&apos;t do it, and speaks about his mother. It&apos;s a very odd but touching scene, mostly due to Hopper&apos;s dedication to the role. By the end he becomes a kind of tragic figure. \n\nHe&apos;s not just the only reason to see the movie; when it&apos;s at its best, Mora&apos;s direction is sharp and exciting, particularly with action scenes as you really don&apos;t know who will get it and how bad in rifle and bullet fire, the blood being a big factor as well. And the cinematography, even in a print that is still shoddy in this updated Troma release, is striking and ethereal, giving the movie a whole other quality than I expected. Is it a great movie? Surely not. The pacing is not always tight, and some of the supporting performances are weak, as they tend to be in low-budget B-movies. But for what they had to work with, star included, it&apos;s definitely worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "This Argentine surrealist political road movie by Pino Solanas is nothing less than one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. Besides politically important as part of the filmmaker&apos;s agenda against neoberal antipopular and antidemocratic prey, it is extremely innovative in the way it makes idiomatic expressions effectively happen in the story, together with amusing and intriguing allegoric characters whose very existence means different traits of Latin American endurace and identity. Besides that, it has a brilliant sarcastic text, a wonderful cinematography and art direction, and brings various parts of the continent as a single people who need to be together in order to make the utopia be turned into reality. I watched this film three times, only the second out of the big screen (precisely the only one I did not feel it as awesome, but just as good). This third time happened two decades after the first one, making me feel astonished again. Solana&apos;s masterpiece is gorgeous, beautiful both visually and in its very concept.",

      "reviewBody": "Review: It was weird watching this film again because it brought back old childhood memories. I remember the epic ending completely amazed me and I thought that the whole thing was real. The movie came out on VHS when I was 7 so I didn&apos;t get to see it until I was around 9 years old so I really thought that Jackie Chan was in pain towards the end. Anyway, this is definitely what I was looking forward to when I started this Jackie Chan season because it&apos;s extremely authentic and full of epic action. In some of the scenes it did seem like they were fighting for no reason and the plot did get a bit confusing in the middle but the epic showdown near the end was excellent. Watching Chan take some formidable punches whilst gearing up to kick butt near the end, still gave me goosebumps but like most of his movies, he just has to add a comedy element to the intense situation. For that time, the stunts were amazing and the choreography was spot on. I just hope that the rest of his earlier movies are just as good. Great Film!\n\nRound-Up: This movie was also directed by Jackie Chan, who gives you an in depth insight into his methods behind the camera, on the bonus features of the DVD, which are definitely worth a watch. I must admit, I did miss all that &quot;You Killed My Master&quot; type of concept but it&apos;s still worth a watch if your into you vintage Kung Fu movies.\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedy, Kung Fu movies, which came out on VHS during the 80&apos;s. 7/10",

There fun poked at greedy players, foreign imports and egotistical coaches! The film itself is about a huge fan of the New York Knicks who becomes coach of the New York Knicks by becoming close to the new owner of the Knicks Wild Bill Burgess( Frank Langella)\n\nThe cameos in the film are plentiful and while MJ himself does not make an appearance it gives a funny insight into what its like to be on the court and what makes players tick. One shot of John Salley making a free throw is very striking and would send a shiver down any sports fan of any sport.\n\nIts not a blue chips type basketball film, its a comedy/sports movie that is easy to watch and thats why i am giving it a 7!\n\nP.S look out for a rare cameo from Leroy from Fame as a dancer!"

However, in my opinion it&apos;s still an average movie because it never gets to high quality comedy moments. The plot is developed through various couples that have a hard time staying together and with their relatives who are involved in their daily troubles. During the movie the stories of the couples mix with each other making the relations among them even more complicated. Besides the comic and slightly dramatic parts of the movie, there&apos;s also a romantic side of it which emerges mainly at the end of it. As for the actors I liked Silvio Orlando who fitted in well in his role and who has a natural comic side of his looks and personality.",

Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.

Here, men have the power of demons.  And Death itself is an illusion.&quot;\n\nClive Barker&apos;s Lord of Illusions is a terrifying glimpse into another world in which few have traveled.  Those who have been there, didn&apos;t like what Barker had to show them.  I wasn&apos;t even impressed with it upon my first viewing.  I simply forgot it, lumped it in with the other, countless horror films I&apos;ve seen and will never see again.  However, I recently rediscovered it...and was completely awestruck.  The theatrical release did not do the film justice.  It dropped priceless minutes of film and much need footage. I strongly urge you to seek out the uncut director&apos;s version on DVD format. This is a very big horror movie, and a hidden treasure at that; hidden under a brilliant detective story and surrounded by film noir.  But I promise you there is a horror spectacle buried under there.  It may be a little slow going at times...but all that build-up makes whatever happens all the more effective.  Lord of Illusions is an unbelievably awesome, genre-twisting experience (and was never bastardized by a sequel).  Everyone needs to take this journey again.  Please Mr. Barker...make another film.\n\nDorothea:  &quot;What the f**k are you?&quot;\n\nNix:  &quot;A man who wanted to be a God...and changed his mind.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "What can one attribute to another entry into the &quot;Saw&quot; franchise? Number 7 comes right on the heels of the 3D craze and purports to be its final chapter. So Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is still dead and but his legacy still goes on in flashbacks. And in a protégé, Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). And in his widow, Jill (Betsy Russell). The entire soap opera of Jigsaw&apos;s family and professional life carries a narrative that attempts to reconcile the final film with the beginning of the franchise, and it definitely does seem to have recapitulated rather well for both hardcore fans as well as fairweather ones. But it has to be said that the films have been on a downward spiral since its fantastic first installment. It delivers the gore in more elaborate ways than the past few films have -- considering how quickly they were rushed out -- but loses that sense of cleverness and more importantly, that sense of menace that the franchise has always attempted to retain.\n\nAfter the previous six films, the franchise does not so much look through the eye of the victims anymore as it does its villains who have an entire mythology unto themselves. And &quot;Saw 3D&quot; almost solely focuses on Hoffman, who it really has to be said, is a sad substitute for Jigsaw. He carries on his messiah&apos;s waning moralistic philosophy by continuing to find victims in need of a baptism by blood but finds himself hindered by Jill who is now cooperating with the police and giving them everything she knows to spite her husband&apos;s latest protégé. Add to this one Bobby Dagen (an actually funny Sean Patrick Flanery), who has written a best-selling book and sold DVDs about being a Jigsaw survivor and profiting from Hoffman&apos;s hallowed gift of life. Suffice to say, he (and his wife) quickly becomes the main plaything of this film&apos;s grand guignol torture play with 60 minutes set on the clock.\n\nNow, even with the requisite twists and better-than-expected inventiveness of its traps, &quot;Saw 3D&quot; does not deliver in the least with its titular promise -- it&apos;s 3D sets yet another low standard for the technology. If the onus on watching this film is to attempt a different perspective, then it never quite reaches the mark. But who are we really kidding here? It&apos;s just one more excuse to milk this cash cow. The franchise has truly run its course. If you watched and enjoyed all seven of its films, at least you can be proud of that. Right? Anyone?\n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n",

      "reviewBody": "In the late 1980s, exploitation giant Cannon Films released a series of direct-to-video action flicks called &apos;Action-Adventure Theater,&apos; which sported the endorsement of &apos;B&apos; movie icon Michael Dudikoff. These four movies were cheap, zero-budget knockoffs from smaller European producers that had no chance of being widely marketed in the United States.\n\n&apos;Un Ponte per l&apos;inferno&apos; AKA &apos;Bridge to Hell&apos; is the lone title in this series with an historical context, set in Yugoslavia during World War II. The film was written and directed by Umberto Lenzi, whose career was in freefall at this point and would soon include more low-budget stinkers and hack television credits. Italian cult cinema fans are usually aware of Lenzi, who became a master of the giallo through such charmers as &apos;Orgasmo&apos; and &apos;Seven Blood-Stained Orchids&apos; while milking the war genre in &apos;Battle of the Commandos&apos; and &apos;The Greatest Battle.&apos; After becoming a recognized talent during the 1960s and 70s, however, Lenzi seemed to lose his mind, taking part in the deplorable &apos;Eaten Alive&apos; and &apos;Cannibal Ferox&apos; besides other trashy horror films.\n\nLenzi was clearly out of options in his directorial career by the time of this film, as its cheapness is apparent from the beginning. The action takes place in Yugoslavia during the time of German occupation and focuses on three escaped POWs who are trying to reach the allied forces in Italy: Lieutenant Bill Rogers (Andy J. Forest), a U.S. air force pilot; Sergeant Mario Espozi (Carlo Mucari), an Italian soldier; and Blinz (Paki Valente), an Austrian who has deserted the Wehrmacht. With help from an Orthodox priest, the trio is led to a band of partisans who need pilots to fly their two remaining airplanes and bombard German armaments in the hillsides. The POWs meanwhile learn from nun-turned-partisan Vanya (Francesca Ferre) of priceless gold chalices that are enshrined in her order&apos;s St. Basil convent. After running two aerial missions successfully, the POWs decide amongst themselves to steal the treasure. They exchange their flying services for weapons and get help from Vanya to find the chapel, unaware of their plan.\n\nThe premise of &apos;Bridge to Hell&apos; is terribly weak and there is nothing in the script or production values to keep things afloat. It is all just a pretext for several lame action sequences in which a tiny partisan group fights hundreds of Germans and mows them down without breaking a sweat. Most of these sequences are badly acted and interspersed with stock footage from better-financed productions. This is obvious from how the film&apos;s characters are shown in tight locations and never integral to what is &apos;happening&apos; nearby. There are times aplenty when continuity and editing skills are forgotten, leading to hilariously bad moments. The photography by adult film cinematographer Luigi Ciccarese is also overexposed and has washed-out color; it seems to have been downgraded in order for the aging stock footage to look more cohesive with Lenzi&apos;s own work.\n\nThere is nothing in the plot to generate dramatic tension and the film quickly becomes a ridiculous, poorly thought-out cycle of gunfights, aerial maneuvers, and running through forests (as in trees, not Andy J.). The aerial bombardments by these POWs involve two shod biplanes that seem like relics from World War I and bombs that are thrown from the planes by hand(!). No matter how old or new the planes are, the idea of two such aircraft taking on a swarm of advanced German fighters (which the stock footage clearly shows) is ridiculous. Partisans on the ground stave off dozens of Germans with a few machine guns when in real life they wouldn&apos;t have lasted for more than two seconds. There are also crazy plot gaps such as when German attack dogs emerge from thin air and are gone as quickly as they came. Additional treats are the horrible audio quality and synthesized music by Fabio Frizzi that is pretty much a single theme repeated over and over again (like the plot). The very small pluses in this film are occasional touches of humor (Forest and Mucari bet a Rita Hayworth photo and a broken pocket watch during bombardment) and the presence of Francesca Ferre, who draws attention rather easily.\n\nOne can never expect much from direct-to-video films, but it&apos;s clear that Umberto Lenzi hardly tried to make this film entertaining. Assuming he knew how cheap this movie would be, the director could have written a script that focused on character and did away with grandiose visions like &apos;The Greatest Battle.&apos; But for one reason or another, Lenzi fooled himself into thinking that &apos;Bridge to Hell&apos; could achieve those heights with the right amount of cleverness. This is largely why &apos;Bride to Hell&apos; will stay buried in a tall mountain of 80s shlock, with little to no artistic merit.\n\n-Turkey- (0 stars out of 4)",

She goes undercover in America&apos;s heartland and befriends farmer Tom Berenger, who may have had something to do with the whole thing.\n\nRacism and political beliefs courtesy of Costa-Gavras. Many viewers feel this film completely missed the mark on both accounts. I, on the other hand, have always enjoyed the film very much and think of it mostly as a drama piece, focusing mostly on Berenger&apos;s and Winger&apos;s relationship. As a suspense flick it also delivers, with high tension especially during the climatic finale. Granted, some scenes are pretty tough to take, but from my point of view this is an excellent study of how many &quot;pure&quot; white folks see the world. They&apos;re not depicted here as complete and utter monsters, but regular folks who have radically different worldview than most (I hope).\n\nOn the trivia side, Berenger himself said in an interview that this was his favorite among all his films.",

      "reviewBody": "There were many movies that I really wanted to review but this is the one that has finally forced me to register. \n\nPerinbaba is a cult film in Slovakia (and Czech Republic to some extent). It is broadcasted every year during Christmas holidays, everyone knows it and everyone has seen it and rightfully so. The director, Juraj Jakubisko, is very artistic - too artistic actually, most of his movies are simply too allegorical for most of the viewers to enjoy. But for some reason, when it comes to this fairy tale, it works perfectly. \n\nWell, it is a fairy tale only on paper. And I viewed it as a fairy tale when I was a kid (and I enjoyed it very much). But once you become an adult, you start to notice all the metaphors and allegories in this movie and you begin to enjoy it even more. \n\nAs a kid, you watch this movie and you see a fairy tale about a young boy falling in love and pursuing that love, despite having to face many obstacles in order to do so. As an adult, you see a very real, hidden story of a man coming of age, a story of love, sex, greed, lust, death... \n\nA young boy, Jakub, sheltered from the world by the motherly figure Perinbaba escapes his &quot;mother&apos;s nest&quot; despite her efforts to keep him protected forever. He does it for a girl, Albetka, and he is forced to face the real world. An world full of evil, sadness, even Death herself. And a world full of beauty, beauty that is worth all the suffering.\n\nIt is not a typical fairy tale. Yes, it has some aspects of a fairy tale, but in some aspects it is also a horror movie, it is a very sexual movie (though this is cleverly hidden from the younger audiences, maybe even most of the adult audiences) and most of all, it is a movie about every man&apos;s journey from childhood to adulthood. The Slovak folklore, culture, mentality and the style of Jakubisko might make it a bit hard to understand and fully appreciate for foreign viewers, but you should give it a try nevertheless. \n\nI am very tempted to say 10/10, but OK, 9/10 (just to leave 10/10 for really PERFECT movies).",

Dealing with a postman officer , Dove Williams (Wayde Preston) , track down a group of cutthroats who have robbed a stagecoach in Texas . He faces off the dangerous leader of the nasty gang , Barnett (Rik Battaglia) , and his villainous henchmen : Manolo (Raf Baldassarre as Raf Baldwin) and the rapist Black (Aldo Berti) . Along the way, our brave , valiant hero Dove Williams teams up with a desert roguish crook , El Loco (Marco Zuanelli) , who rides a donkey .\n\nIt&apos;s full of action , exaggerated characters , shootouts with high body count , loads of violence , but also displays some exciting surprises in its uneven screenplay with full of thrilling as well as twisted and bloody events . It&apos;s a short budget film with usual actors , professional technicians, evocative production values and passable results . However, the environment is quite poor with dilapidated towns and a few people, a gloomy and decadent environment showing the early end of the Spagetti Western genre that a little later originated its last rattles at the Seventies . The film relies heavily on the continuous relationship between the relentless revenger played by American Wayde Preston and the resourceful rogue performed by Marco Zuanelli . &quot;Ehi amigo... sei morto! (1970)&quot; is an ordinary western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist , a postman officer become a gunslinger , against his relentless enemies , an ominous band led by Barnett . Stars Wayde Preston who&apos;s a little wooden , but he ravages the screen , kills , shoots , hits and runs . As Wayde Preston playing the hunk gunfighter playing in his usual hieratic style . Here U. S actor Wayde Preston taking his turn as regular avenger , a grim but daredevil hero . Preston was briefly a U. S. TV star in the late 1950s. Preston was born in Denver, Colorado, Estados Unidos. Working for TV , he took the title role of Christopher Colt in three seasons of the Western show &apos;Colt .45&apos;, a spinoff from his guest appearances on the more successful &apos;Tenderfoot&apos;. Like Clint Eastwood he emigrated to Italy to achieve fame and fortune, however his roles were relegated to second-class Spaghetti Westerns . As he performed : Vivo per la tua morte (1968) , L&apos;ira di Dio (1968) , Sartana nella valle degli avvoltoi (1970) , A Man Called Sledge (1970), Ehi amigo ... sei morto! (1970). And other appearances in all kinds of genres , such as : Anónima de asesinos (1966) , Hollywood man (1976), Smokey and the judge (1980) and Captain America (1990) . Being accompanied by other Italian actors , Spaghetti regulars , such as Rik Battaglia , Marco Zuanelli, Raf Baldassarre , and Aldo Berti as a violent rapist stands out\n\nThere is plenty of thrills and run-of-the-mill action in the movie , guaranteeing some crossfire or stunts every few minutes . The film is fast moving including twists , turns and being entertaining enough but resulting to be a mediocre flick . It contains atmospheric cinematography , although somewhat dark , photographed by by cameraman Sergio D&apos;Offizi in the Dino Laurentiis studios, Roma, and Lacio, Italia , but no Almeria . Nice score by composer Carlo Savina in Spaghetti style , including an enjoyable leitmotif and catching song . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Paolo Bianchini and he often used the pseudonym as Paul Maxwell. At this film he inclined toward violence and too much action . He made various ¨Spaghetti¨ such as Ehi Amigo... Sei Morto! , 1968 Lo Quiero Muerto , 1968 God Made Them... I Kill Them and ¨Spy genre¨ such as 1969 Devilman Story , 1968 Superargo, 1967 Hypnos Follia Di Un massacre , 1966 Il Gioco Delle Spie . Rating : 5/10 , a routine Western , though passable for some typical Spaghetti scenes.",

I seem to remember seeing a snippet of it on TV at some point, but it looked goofy so I passed on it.\n\nIn Seacoast one day (when it still lived), I chanced upon a single DVD of LEXX Season 2, for $10. I had heard some people talking about it online and decided to give it a chance. WHOA...what a strange trip that was. I then went back and bought the rest and it was just as Inventive and creative, so did some research and discovered that season 1 is actually four films that aired on Showtime, starting with I Worship His Shadow. I was so sucked into that world that I had to know how it all started and eventually did find all four films. I then watched seasons 3 and 4, all equally insane.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch this film (and the rest of LEXX) if you can find it. It&apos;s strange and quirky but also so epic that words cannot describe. A brilliantly realized universe and some of the craziest science fiction ever made.\n\nYo Way Yo!",

      "reviewBody": "Feeling like a swan song, 82-year old French auteur Jacques Rivette&apos;s Around a Small Mountain is a charming and utterly captivating lament for the passing of time. At 84 minutes long, the shortest Rivette film to date, it evokes nostalgia for a bygone era of small traveling shows and circuses with their &quot;posters peeling underneath last summer&apos;s morning glory vine,&quot; shows that relied on an intimate connection between performers and audience. Set in the Languedoc region of Southern France, the mountain in the original title is the Pic Saint Loup, but it can also be said to reflect the mountain that one woman must climb to be liberated from the stranglehold of the memories that have run her life.\n\nThe main form of entertainment in the mountain village is a single-tent circus performed to a sparse audience. Though Alexandre (André Marcon), one of the clowns says, &quot;We&apos;re the last classics,&quot; but they refuse to rung the curtain down. As the film opens, Kate (Jane Birkin), a former circus performer, now a textile designer in Paris is stranded on a country road as her car breaks down. Her improbable but charming savior is an Italian traveler Vittorio (Sergio Castellitto) who bypasses her, then turns around and comes back to help. Without saying a word, he fixes her car and leaves without saying goodbye. Of course, the two are destined to meet again and it is at the circus in the nearby town that Kate is revisiting after an absence of fifteen years. Vittorio takes an interest in Kate and impulsively decides to rent a room above a café and attend the circus performance that evening.\n\nAt the show, Vittorio watches a routine, perhaps performed hundreds of times, that involves two clowns, a bunch of ordinary dinner plates, and a pistol. From the audience, Vittorio emits a burst of laughter, an unlikely event that startles even the performers. Although the antics of the clowns seem tired and outdated and much of the humor seems strained, there is still a certain magic in the performance that brings back the memory of days gone by. Gradually we learn that the circus was once owned by Kate&apos;s father and that she left fifteen years ago after her lover Antoine died in a tragic on-stage accident, an event that has been buried deep within her and one that she has been reluctant to confront. \n\nVittorio does not overtly convey any romantic intentions, yet he pursues his interest in Kate in a laid back, understated way. Though she is withholding and aloof, their relationship is sweet and their conversations very real. She states that she does not want to change because she has &quot;gotten used to her pain,&quot; but softens as Vittorio tells her, &quot;The dragons in your life are no more than princesses longing to be free.&quot; With the aid of the other circus performers that include Marlo (Jacques Bonnaffé), Kate&apos;s daughter Clémence, (Julie-Marie Parmentier), a trapeze artist, her niece Margot (Helene de Vallombreuse), Wilfrid (Tintin Orsoni) and Alexandre, Kate is assisted by her fiends to face her demons.\n\nThough Around a Small Mountain is playful, it is also enigmatic as witness one sequence in which the actors emerge from a tent, then circle around to come out again, offering a phrase or moral directly to the camera, any of which could apply to the film. As we come to realize, the circus is like life, and, according to Vittorio, &quot;the most dangerous place in the world&quot;, but Kate&apos;s willingness to come to terms with her fears make it also &quot;the place where everything is possible.&quot;",

But some of it I found very off-putting.\n\nFirst, to the good: the cinematography is almost constantly remarkable. The way scenes are framed, the constant variation of camera angles, the switches between close and far, etc. I almost would have preferred this without sound. There was so much of interest to watch.\n\nThere was little of interest to hear, however. The dialogue is inane. And the protagonist is an egotistical, selfish, thoroughly repugnant excuse for a man. Maybe he&apos;s alienated from his world. Why would I care? He does everything to demonstrate that he cares about nothing and no one but himself.\n\nJust past the midpoint of this movie, it starts to become interesting when the photographer detects something in the background of one of his photos. When it turns out a man was murdered, he wants to know more. But why? He&apos;s never shown any interest in anything other than himself up until then?\n\nAnd, finally, he seems to forget about it all.\n\nWatch this once for the amazing camerawork. But as for the plot, the characters, and the rest, don&apos;t expect to be engaged. I certainly wasn&apos;t.",

Maybe the writer potentially can translate it better on screen and set a new benchmark. Sadly the reality speaks a different lingo. Major part of the movie is akin to waiting lounge. Twiddling thumbs. Admist the the eerie camera movement and spooky sound effects you await for the plot to get going. Sadly the snail twitches after a point when the audience has totally lost interest. Very similar to dilly-dallying a candy with a kid and offering it when he doesn&apos;t want any more. \n\nOwing to the failed engine, the performances of everyone gets awashed. \n\nAgreed that RGV believes in taking risks and providing platform to newcomers. But with Phoonk-II one can only advise that he should drop his entire team like hot potatoes and start afresh. And please leave the horror genre alone."

      "reviewBody": "Bollywood directors are experimenting in a rather harmless manner nowadays, and Action Replayy is the result of such an attempt from Vipul Shah, who entertained us with Namastey London and disappointed us with London Dreams in the previous years. However, Action Replayy is much much better than the boring London Dreams. In fact, it is entertaining and good. Moreover, the movie comes up with a pleasant surprise, Aditya Roy Kapoor. He is that type of typical bollywood guy, with his cute and innocent looks, and he is so lucky to get such a long role in such a big film. He performs equally, or even more than Akshay Kumar, in every sequence. In fact, he is the real hero of the movie. So, the movie is about a son travelling back to 1970s to set his parents&apos; marriage alright. A lot of questions of plagiarism come along with the subject of travelling through time, but I never felt any resemblance with any other movie, this is original work, IMO. There are many flaws in the movie, but still it is enjoyable, with an interesting screenplay and good performances. Also, the songs are good, even though few of them are not properly placed. There are lot of entertaining moments throughout the film, some of them are very good. The performances are good, and Aditya Roy Kapoor is on the top amongst all. Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are good, so as Rannvijay Singh, Om Puri, Kirron Kher, Neha Dhupia, Rajpal Yadav etc. One big letdown is the ending of the movie, the credits begin to roll up so quickly, there should have been a proper ending. May be editor&apos;s mistake!!\n\nOn the whole, it is a good movie, definitely worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "***SPOILERS*** Based on Nathanael West&apos;s 1939 short story &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; the film lives up to all it&apos;s hype even though it was hardly a smashing box office success back in 1975 when it was released. The movie starts out with young Harvard educated Tom Hackett, William Atherton, trying to get a job at a big Hollywood studio as one of its graphic and art designers. Living at the San Bernardino Arms Tom runs into a bunch of people who are also looking to make it big in Tinsel Town but keep running into dead ends. It&apos;s there where Tom meets aspiring actress Faye Greener, Karen Black, who&apos;s trying to break into the movies in her feeling that the grass is greener on the other side, Tensile Town, then where she&apos;s now living.\n\nTom in fact does get himself a good paying and prestigious job at Paramount Studios as a graphic designer but is somehow stuck on the part time actress, who&apos;s lucky to get cameo roles in the movies, Faye Greener who for some reason doesn&apos;t take advantage of Tom&apos;s position in getting her better roles. Faye as it turns out is into wild partying with the rough crowd that includes a number of Mexican cock fight enthusiasts which turns the very genteel and sensitive Tom off. In fact Tom himself gets corrupted by Faye&apos;s lifestyle in losing himself when he gets drunk and high on pot before a cock fight that gets him so horny and heated up that he almost ends up raping her.\n\nThere&apos;s also Faye&apos;s father the washed up vaudevillian song &amp; dance man Harry Greener,Burgess Meredith,who&apos;s really pushing his luck, and weak heart, as a door to door snake oil salesman who what seems like hasn&apos;t made a single sale during the entire duration he&apos;s in the movie. As Harry&apos;s luck and heart starts to run out Faye in desperation tries to get him back to health by going to see faith healer Big Moma or Sister, Geraldine Page, at one of her sermons. This in fact does help Harry out a bit but before you know it his heart gives out from all the excitement and he dies halfway through the film.\n\nThe person who really steals the acting honors as well as the hearts of all of us watching the film is that sad eyed and repressed, in life love and everything else, dufus the homely and knuckle crunching Homer Simpson, Donald Southerland. Homer a transplanted Mid-Westerners has moved to the Sunshine State to live out his last years in peace and quite without expecting much excitement in doing that. it&apos;s when Homer runs into Faye who seems to have some feelings for him that his sad &amp; sorry life starts to lighten up a bit. Faye just takes advantage of the sad sack by leading him on in that she&apos;s in love with him where at the same time is having it on with almost every man, except Homer &amp; Tom, in the vicinity between San Bernardino to Beverly Hills.\n\nThe end comes when a very naive and heart sick Homer finds out that his live in companion Faye, who has no sexual relation with him at all, has been cheating and making a complete and total fool of him which causes Homer to have an emotional breakdown. This causes a heart broken Homer to pack up and head for who knows where who then runs into the bratty 12 year old Adore Loomis, Jackie Earl Haley, who&apos;s been unmercifully teasing the poor guy since the movie started. It&apos;s when Adore pushed the wrong button, by striking him in the head with a rock, that Homer finally lost it and that set the stage for the movies fairy climax. That all happened at the grand primer and opening of Cecil B. DeMill&apos;s latest multi million dollar spectacular cinema epic &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;. By the time that the movie &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; was finally over it wasn&apos;t &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; that everyone remembered but the riot that Adore sparked which in fact ended up burning down all of Tinsel Town!\n\nThe 144 minute movie kept your interest with a number of weird sub-plots and strange characters thrown into it but that was nothing compared to it&apos;s final ten or so minutes when the earth, or Hollywood, caught fire in one of the most shocking and realistic disaster scenes,in what&apos;s not considered a disaster movie, in all of motion picture history! And that&apos;s without even the used of computer enhanced technology! Director John Schesinger staged the final riot scene much like the real life, and death, notorious April 9th 1948 &quot;Bogotazo&quot; that in a 24 hour period lead to the deaths and injuries of between 3,000 to 5,000 people and burned downtown Bogata Columbia to the ground.",

      "reviewBody": "As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody.\n\nIt looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clichés. The story&apos;s premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It&apos;s if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it.\n\nNevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston&apos;s technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form.\n\nAnd here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There&apos;s a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled – often impeccably – by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There&apos;s also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it&apos;s possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie.\n\nBut while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn&apos;t have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn&apos;t seem conceived as a comedy. There&apos;s not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don&apos;t have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Clubbed to Death &quot; (called &quot;Lola in Technoland&quot; in Germany) is a typical French movie - it&apos;s about music, it&apos;s about youth, it&apos;s about desire and about the nineties. A young French girl misses her bus and is led to a suburban techno music club by accident where she faces the electronic dance music culture as well as a big love affair. That&apos;s the whole plot, but it&apos;s enough, as many French movies don&apos;t have much contents - but have many things to tell and a big impact on the viewers.\n\n&quot;Lola in Technoland&quot; lives from its many impressions about love and music - actually there are not even many action and dialogues going on, but the music (mainly electronic dance and trance grooves) accompanies the heroine&apos;s trip through the clubbing world and love affairs. It&apos;s very well photographed and shows a permanent atmosphere of emptiness, desires and longings. There isn&apos;t the typical hectic setting of a bright and loud and battered dance club, but the locations rather appear a surreal suburban dreamscape at night.\n\nOn the good side, this movie is stunning, impressive, groovy, erotic and a contemporary French answer to the British &quot;Trainspotting&quot; cinema, but without the noise, tempo, words, lights and violence. On the bad side, it&apos;s just a well-done music video clip, soft sex movie and background visual for closing your eyes and chilling out on your sofa - or in the club of your choise. Anyway, it&apos;s an outstanding French film and a very stylish insight into the clubbing scene of the nineties with a brilliant sound track!",

      "reviewBody": "In the Asta Nielsen version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; from 1921 we do not have a prince Hamlet but a princess Hamlet. On first sight one expects this to have enormous consequences. Apart from the tension between ratio and madness there also is the tension between the sexes. Especially the relationships of Hamlet to the (male) Horatio and the (female) Ophelia are no longer the same as in the original Shakespeare play. In reality the &quot;Hamlet&quot; movie of 1921 is more conventional then one is inclined to think at first.\n\nThe part of Hamlet neatly fits in the image of Asta Nielsen, who often played strong-willed women that are not dominated by men. Everybody knows that Louise Brooks plays the Lulu character in the Pabst adaptation (1929) of Frank Wedekinds &quot;Die Buchse der Pandora&quot;. Far fewer people know that Asta Nielsen plays the Lulu character in Leopold Jessners adaptation (1923) of &quot;Erdgeist&quot;.\n\nAsta Nielsen is also known for her more naturalistic way of acting. During the age of the silent cinema overly theatrical acting was still very much in vogue. In this &quot;Hamlet&quot; movie we only have to compare the acting of Asta Nielsen with that of Eduard von Winterstein, playing uncle Claudius.",

There&apos;s mass destruction and tons of carnage as everything on-screen is blown to bits...plus it&apos;s got Emilio Estevez. What&apos;s better than that? The movie does require major suspension of disbelief as some of the story elements don&apos;t work (for example: the honeymooner&apos;s car works just fine, but every other machine on earth, from lawn-mowers, electric knives, trucks, and even steam-rollers, go haywire). But then again, this movie is all about fun. The best part of the movie (besides Emilio) is that no one is shown any sympathy...not even kids; in one stand-out scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of. Sadly, I feel that King will never direct again.\n\nNote for genre buffs: C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy."

It is probably more faithful to the books and having struggled through reading those, I can tell you that I much prefer the celluloid Chan to the literary ones.\n\nWhat really struck me as odd was that the actor doing the Warner Oland role sounded as though he was trying to sound like Sidney Toler whom I always found to be an inferior Chan with his &quot;chopstick&quot; delivery of lines and obvious makeup.\n\nStill, it&apos;s kinda cool to have some sort of version existing at all.",

The reason for this must be its close resemblance to Sunrise, which is a masterpiece of the first order. Yes, City Girl does remind one of Sunrise in its mood and focus. A young rube from Minnesota (Charles Farrell) travels to Chicago to sell his father&apos;s wheat crop. Business-wise, the trip doesn&apos;t go well, but his romantic world blossoms when he meets up with a lonely waitress (Mary Duncan). The two marry, and the rest of the film deals with Duncan&apos;s fight for acceptance on the farm, where she faces a fierce opponent in her father-in-law (David Torrence). The film is romantic, emotionally moving and utterly beautiful. Yes, it is a lot like Sunrise, but, heck, who wouldn&apos;t want a second Sunrise? It&apos;s hardly a carbon copy, anyway, so it&apos;s like another wonderful gift. City Girl is a masterpiece, as well. I&apos;m not the biggest fan of Murnau&apos;s German films, but his three surviving American films are probably the best proof of the sentiment that the silent cinema was at a miraculous level right when it was snuffed by sound. Murnau tragically died in an auto accident in 1931. I find it hard to imagine his work in the talkies, but I have an inkling that the cinema would be rather different if he had survived.",

It&apos;s funny in places and sentimental enough for a Christmas film; about what most viewers will expect I think.\n\nThe movie finds Lance and Mia Sullivan (Chestnut and Calhoun) having a weekend Christmas party that they invite all their old friends to. Lance is retiring this year, as a star running back for the New York Giants, and Mia has some tragic news she&apos;s kept secret from the rest of the friend group. Lance hasn&apos;t been on speaking terms with his old best friend, Harper Stewart (Diggs), since the events of the original movie. Harper is now expecting a child with his nine-month pregnant wife, Robin (Lathan). Making things hard for them is the fact that Harper recently lost his teaching job, which he hasn&apos;t told Robin about, and hasn&apos;t written a hit book in years. At the advice of his agent (John Michael Higgins) he&apos;s thinking of doing an unauthorized biography on Lance. He&apos;ll of course have to smooth things over with him first in order to do so. Each of the other friends has their own drama and troubled relationships.\n\nI never saw the original 1999 hit so I can&apos;t honestly say how this sequel lives up to it but I&apos;m guessing fans of the original film would be pleased. It seems like your average old &apos;friends reunion movie&apos;. Perhaps it&apos;s a tad too melodramatic (in places) but there are enough decent laughs to keep it entertaining. My favorite performance is by Terrence Howard, who undoubtedly has the most comedic role, but he is also my favorite actor in the thing. I don&apos;t usually go for these types of films but I definitely wasn&apos;t bored (for it&apos;s 2 hour-plus running time) and I&apos;m pretty sure fans of these flicks will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gmBnRGZV8o",

Being able to speak German like myself is a big plus since the subtitles are horrible. The movies main message is for the German public, especially the Berlinese public to lighten up about multicultural relationships, in other words, Turkish people with German people. It&apos;s a great mix of action, romance, comedy and some more action. Great use of the camera, really one of the best German comedy movies I&apos;ve ever seen. If your on the look out for movies that make you laugh but still touch upon serious issues then this movie is for you.",

      "reviewBody": "Maybe it was the great, eclectic soundtrack with the likes of Django Reinhardt, Herbie Hancock, Perry Como, Curtis Mayfield, Neil Young and Richie Havens, or maybe it was the dark and subtle bits of humor that pleasantly surprised me throughout the movie, but I really enjoyed this one.\n\nWe meet Tom, a forlorn twenty-something man-child still living at home and struggling to take control of his life, played by David Schwimmer of &quot;Friends&quot; fame. Tom gets a call from a woman who mistakenly believes he knew her recently deceased son. He goes along with it, presumably to save her the added grief of knowing her son had no close friends. Of course, Tom&apos;s accommodating nature backfires and he&apos;s asked to give the eulogy for a man he never knew. This sets up a scene with the kind of dark humor seen throughout the movie that audiences are either delighted with or immediately turned off by.\n\nAt the funeral, Tom meets Julie, his unrequited high school crush, played with genuine emotion and winsome grace by Gwyneth Paltrow. Thus begins two relationships that play out over the duration of the film --one with Grace, the bereft mother of the friend Tom never had, played by Barbara Hershey, and the other with Julie.\n\nYes, this movie owes much, in terms of plot and characters, to &quot;The Graduate,&quot; with Hershey playing the counterpart to Anne Bancroft&apos;s Mrs. Robinson. But it turns out to be much more than just an update of the &apos;60s classic. The audience really gets to know the inner turmoil both Tom and Julie are going through -- Tom, both for the guilt of becoming unwittingly involved with Grace, and for also being involved with Julie at the same time, and Julie, for being torn between striking out on her own to escape her overbearing parents and getting into a deep relationship with Tom.\n\nThere are a couple of sideplots going on with Tom&apos;s friends -- Michael Rapaport&apos;s character getting married to a woman his friends don&apos;t like, and Michael Vardan&apos;s married character, making a move on Julie, which obviously infuriates Tom. And Carol Kane as Tom&apos;s mom, is precious. In one scene, he is livid after she bursts into his room unannounced. After she receives a brief scolding for not knocking, she replies &quot;I only wanted to see if you wanted some ice cream,&quot; to which he replies &quot;A little.&quot; \n\nSchwimmer nails the role, with his underplayed, tacit sadness about his so-far-failed attempt at making a responsible life for himself. And Paltrow, well, can she ever miss? Whether for the dark humor, spot-on acting, or superb soundtrack, this one is definitely worth a viewing.",

By today&apos;s standards and with hindsight, it seems a little corny but to the people of that time, the movie showed what could have been a real possibility. This sci-fi movie shows the horrors of war and the price of progress predicted by a film made in 1936 by eyes that were looking at a world on the brink of World War II. It&apos;s a movie that shows what they thought the world would be like if a major war broke out. One good reason for viewing this film is because it shows this perspective, and because it was one of the early serious attempts of a science fiction film that takes a look into the future. For those interested in the history of early sci-fi in the cinema, Things To Come is a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "I won&apos;t say it&apos;s an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other &quot;popular&quot; Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with &quot;Memento&quot; (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of &quot;Memento&quot; with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan&apos;s broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it&apos;s obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn&apos;t even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don&apos;t get a full &quot;interchange&quot; between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more &quot;wrong&quot; than the antagonist. That&apos;s quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most &quot;complex&quot; characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That&apos;s until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn&apos;t make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of &quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013) and &quot;Logan&quot; (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn&apos;t so adorable. He didn&apos;t remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don&apos;t even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It&apos;s after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it&apos;s a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special &quot;10/10&quot; and an &quot;A+&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Brooklyn&apos;s Finest is clichéd cop film only in setup, not in execution. The scripting and a plethora of strong performance elevate the familiar veins that make up the films structure. In fact, three of the most standard-order plot lines are utilized; and undercover cop who blurs the line between righteous and corrupt, a drug cop who exhibits no blurring in his corruption and an aging veteran slugging it through his last week on the job. These cops are played by Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawk and Richard Gere respectively and each gets equal screen time in a triple thread story that eventually converge on one fateful night.\n\nDirector Antoine Fuqua&apos;s latest treads a thin line between tragic and gritty and outright depressing. This is a gloomy film to be sure, everyone is either a cop, murderer, drug dealer or prostitute (sometimes many of the above) and there is no glimpse of sunshine, so to speak, in Fuqua&apos;s Brooklyn. I am a big fan of Fuqua, from his John Woo-esquire debut with The Replacement Killers to the classic cop drama Training Day, to the very underrated Bruce Willis war actionier Tears of the Sun, he is more than a competent auteur and always brings out solid performances from his leads.\n\nHawk (who plays the increasingly corrupt Sal) is perhaps the strongest of three leads, but Gere and Cheadle are very convincing in their roles as well. Unfortunately, despite the admirable development of these characters, the aforementioned ordinary narrative leaves little question about where their respective paths are headed. We also get a blazing comeback from the one and only Wesley Snipes as a criminal and friend of Cheadle&apos;s Tango. Rounding off the talented main players are Brian F. O&apos;Byrne as Sal&apos;s fellow cop and friend and Will Patton as Tango&apos;s lone remaining contact to the just world he feels is fading away. As I have iterated many times, it is the stellar work from the key players that makes Brooklyn&apos;s Finest worth your time.\n\nThe drive behind these three cops is equally compelling. Sal has 5 kids (with 6 and 7 on the way) and is swimming in debt. Through a real-estate contact he sets up a deal to move his growing family to a larger house, only if he can get the big score of drug money he needs. As the date approaches for him to come up with the money he grows increasingly desperate. Gere&apos;s Eddie is a burnt-out cop who has all but lost respect for the job, and his fellow cops have all but lost respect for him. His only remaining duty is to escort a rookie around for his final 7 days but things go far less smoothly then he could have hoped. Finally there is Tango, a UC who has lost all his ties to the real world. His wife is filing for divorce and he wants to be made detective first grade a.s.a.p. and spend the remainder of his days behind a comfortable desk and away from a life of crime. In one of the best sequences, Tango is asked why the sudden urge to get out. He tells of a night where he was pulled over by the cops for speeding and legitimately considered killing them. He wants out.\n\nIf only the despair had been laid on a little less thick and the stereotypes that make up the three main characters polished with a bit more inventiveness, Brooklyn&apos;s Finest could have been a classic in the making. Instead we get only what we would expect; a gritty, bloody and well acted police actionier.\n\nRead all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "HERS TO HOLD (Universal, 1943), directed by Frank Ryan, is a delightful comedy/drama with limited song interludes. It stars Deanna Durbin, the studio&apos;s top singer, who reprises her Penny Craig role originated from both THREE SMART GIRLS (1936) and THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP (1939). While the earlier editions of the Craig family featured Durbin as the youngest of three sisters with a talent for singing, for HERS TO HOLD, the older sisters of Joan and Kay have married, leaving Durbin the sole focus. Charles Winninger and Nella Walker return for the third and final time as Durbin&apos;s high society parents. The only change is the casting of Ludwig Stossel stepping in for the role originated by Ernest Cossart as Binns, the family butler. With the story brought up to date to World War II setting, the formula remains basically the same, only better. Whether Durbin resumes her Penny Craig role or enacts a different character really doesn&apos;t matter for her popularity and first-rate story certainly assures its great box-office success for 1943.\n\nThe story begins at the American National Red Cross where William Morley (Joseph Cotten), a bomber pilot, and his pal, Rosey Blake (Gus Schilling) are both resting after giving blood. The resting is cut short when Penelopie Craig (Deanna Durbin), daughter of a Wall Street business tycoon now living in Sycamore, California, enters to donate blood, with her legs only visible viewing for Bill and Rosey. Bill intends on getting Penny&apos;s name and address written in his little phone book of female listings by pretending to be a doctor. After examining her and getting the information needed, Bill kisses her, leaving Penny both stunned and angry. Returning home in time for her parents (Charles Winninger and Nella Walker) wedding anniversary, Penny is told by her butler, Binns (Ludwig Stossel) that she has received numerous phone calls from William Morley, and tells him the next time he calls, to simply hang up. Morley and Rosey invite themselves to the Craig gathering. Though Penny intends on making a fool of Bill with her guests, Bill is not only step ahead of her plot but gives Penny a public kiss before leaving. Feeling she might be in love, Penny traces down this fresh guy to the Vega Aircraft Factory where she obtains a job as a riveter with the married Hannah Gordon (Fay Helm), unaware that Bill might be receiving orders for active service overseas.\n\nOther members in the cast include Samuel S. Hinds, Evelyn Ankers, Fay Helm, Iris Adrian, Irving Bacon and Nydia Westman. Songs include: &quot;Seguidilla&quot; from George Bizet&apos;s CARMEN; Cole Porter&apos;s &quot;Begin the Beguine,&quot; &quot;Say a Prayer for the Boys Over There,&quot; &quot;The Kashmiri Song&quot; and &quot;Say a Prayer for the Boys Over There&quot; (reprise). Though Durbin&apos;s rendition of &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; is excellent, &quot;Say a Prayer for the Boys Over There&quot; got the nomination for the Academy Award as Best Song. With Winninger&apos;s Judson Craig being somewhat absent-minded this time around, his serious father and daughter talk highlight the proceedings as well as he watching home movies of Penny&apos;s teenage years with scenes lifted from Durbin&apos;s earlier editions of THREE SMART GIRLS and THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP, MAD ABOUT MUSIC (1938) and FIRST LOVE (1939) adding that nostalgic feel to it. With Joseph Cotten a dramatic actor by profession, he shows his flare for light comedy as Durbin showing her ability in handling drama. Though a search for a note left inside a sandwich might be overlong, it adds to the purpose of suspense to the story.\n\nHERS TO HOLD, clocked at 91 minutes, though available on home video and DVD, is one of those once popular movies that has become ignored for television broadcasts over the years. With the exception of limited public television showings in the 1980s, thus far it has never played on any major cable channel. A reflection of the times, on a personal level, HERS TO HOLD still holds up very well and worth the time seeing whenever available. (***1.2)",

Jack Nicholson, typically intense but atypically understated, has possibly his finest hour as Bobby Duprea, a self-hating misogynist ill at ease with himself and the world.  Many people will, when thinking of Nicholson, bring to mind his pantomime pyschopath Johnny from &apos;The Shining&apos;; but Bobby, a profoundly human creation, is actually far more scary.  Elsewhere the film features characteristically gorgeous cinematography from Laszlo Kovaks; a soundtrack that skilfully offsets Tammy Wynette and Chopin; excellent writing throughout and some very black humour. Like a less extreme version of Mike Leigh&apos;s &apos;Naked&apos;, and bristling with uncomfortable truth, &apos;Five Easy Pieces&apos; is a true classic of 1970s cinema. Few films today are as good.",

Yes there are some laughs, but there are far more tears; some of pain, some of joy.  This is a drama with a sense of humor.  You have to keep a sense of humor to survive when life kicks you in the gut.\n\nI&apos;ve read some reviews condemning the politics of this film.  Well, I applaud the political message.  I grew up near an industrial town; one centered on the auto industry, heavy machinery, and agri-business.  As I got older, I watched it disintegrate, through the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, as the grain embargo, auto industry woes and recession bled the life out of the town. It has never recovered.  Many of us felt that Reagan and Thatcher, and their descendants, were monsters who sold their people out for a quick buck; while the parties that were supposed to represent the workers and middle class joined in the takings.  To us, this isn&apos;t an anti-Thatcher film; it&apos;s the truth.\n\nThe performances of this film, particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson, as well as Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald are top notch.  There is a sweet and painful romance here; but it is the community of the miners, through the life of the band, that is the center here. The music is beautiful and will move you.  The piece played as the pit closure is finalized stirs so many emotions. The rendition of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; brings tears to your eyes.  The review in our local alternative paper said the surprise near the end would reduce even the hardest heart to tears, and they were right.\n\nThere is so much to see and love about this film, regardless of your political beliefs.  Music does matter, but the people who create it matter, too.  Communities matter, love matters.  This is what good filmmaking is all about.  See this film.  You&apos;ll laugh a bit, cry a lot, get angry, become sad; but, you&apos;ll never be bored."

      "reviewBody": "Being a huge b-movie fan, I had to see this movie. It is VERY funny and entertaining and still a b-movie even with a larger budget, but the only footage of tomatoes moving and attacking people (the best part of the original) is taken from the original &quot;attack&quot; film. Here instead we got tomatoes that look exactly like people. But when you buy an &quot;attack of the killer tomatoes&quot; movie that shows a giant killer tomato attacking on the cover, you expect to see a giant killer tomato attacking in the movie! John Astin as Gangreen was funny, but I like the original movie&apos;s reason for tomato attacks. In the original, man altered tomatoes to make them better but accidently gave them the ability to grow and attack people.\n\nIn this movie that is all ignored and now the killer tomatoes were made by a evil professor in his basement.\n\nI think the original plot AND movie are much better, but this films is still very funny in it&apos;s own way. And I am surprised it got away with many of the raunchy jokes while staying PG.\n\nRecommended if you want to laugh."

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to Cinema&apos;s hall of fame of screen villains Robert Walker&apos;s Bruno Anthony has to rank up there with the best of them. Outwardly harmless, he possesses the twisted psyche of a spoiled mummy&apos;s boy who is all too willing to resort to murder to get his own way (sounds a little like Norman Bates, doesn&apos;t it?).\n\nWalker graces the role with sly hints of effeminacy that hint at his character&apos;s sexual orientation, something that in 1951 would have contributed to the overall impression of louche decadence. And what a loathsome creature he truly is, almost toadying towards tennis player Guy Haines as he ingratiates his way into the hapless athlete&apos;s life only to turn it upside down with his diabolical &apos;criss-cross&apos; plan. To be fair, Haines is a tailor-made victim, and the passive indecision of his character is perhaps the film&apos;s biggest flaw. As others have no doubt noted, Haines would only need have gone to the police to sort everything out because Bruno&apos;s suave mask is clearly as fragile as an eggshell, and even a novice interrogator would quickly determine that something&apos;s not right about him.\n\nAs murder plots go, it&apos;s not a bad idea – apart from the unlikelihood of two like-minded strangers meeting, discussing and then agreeing to such a plot in the first place. Bruno takes the vaguest of affirmations – distractedly delivered by Haines to shake him off – as confirmation that his plan is a goer and promptly murders Haine&apos;s estranged wife in a justifiably famous fairground murder scene.\n\nThe psychological subtext is laid on pretty thick for an early fifties film, making it a piece of work that rewards repeated viewings. Walker&apos;s character grows increasingly menacing as the film progresses, not through any changes of attitude or manner on his part, but because of what the audience learns about him as the story unfolds. For the most part, however, his role in the film is simply as a villainous foil for the clear-cut Haines, which is a shame as it would have been interesting to see just how Bruno became as twisted as he was. Nevertheless, Strangers on a Train deserves the classic status it enjoys, and is worth a couple of hours of anybody&apos;s time.",

If you have ever wet yourself sitting through Monty Python you are going to enjoy this. This isn&apos;t Will and Grace. \n\nMost of the songs are great, the song based around a dead man with scissors in his neck is brilliant. They are cheesy, OTT and have some of the best dance moves since Ricky Martin tried dismally to samba his way into the charts. I am still humming along to some of the tunes (from the Katakuris, not Ricky Martin. Although I wish he&apos;d been a guest at the Katakuri&apos;s guest house.) My greatest problem with the film comes from its advertising. It is labelled as a &quot;Cannibal Musical&quot; in some press releases. Ignore this. There is no cannibalism in this film. Not even a suggestion of it. Nobody even says in close up; &quot;Oh I am hungry&quot; and then is juxtaposed with a shot of a dead body. The only feasible description of this film which mentions cannibalism is: &quot;Is not about cannibalism, unless if by cannibalism you mean songs&quot;. \n\nYou are going to have a great time watching this film and if you are familiar with Miike I think it is safe to say that this film is more shocking that even Ichi the Killer. Why? Because at the end of it you feel all warm and fluffy inside and I dare say nobody expects this from Takashi Miike. I certainly didn&apos;t.",

It was refreshing to see a well made film about a vibrant society and too hear exceptional music. &apos;Mahaleo&apos; is a band that celebrated 30 years and was part of the troubled history of the country in this period. We learn more about its members, some of them had became physicians or even politicians, but they seem to be well known and popular in Madagascar. This was a good opportunity to learn more about them, about the music and culture of their country and first of all to hear a lot of good music, in tune with modern folk, blues and mainstream world over. A very good mention for the excellent translation in French of the words of the songs, they were so good that I had the feeling that I am reading words of songs from Dylan.",

      "reviewBody": "If there&apos;s a common point that links all 3 of these short movies, it&apos;s how they show human stupidity and the realistic statement that that&apos;s the reason why we are coming to our own end.\n\nThe first movie present us with a zombie scenario, more credible than those created by other movies. It&apos;s a superb critic of a society drowned in consumerism, the abuse of other life forms and the worshipping of the shallow. It also presents us with the hypocrisy people live by, with somehow subtle imagery of religion and the disregard for those same values when it comes to feeling pleasure through the material and sex. The point of view is original, for which we see the event unfold mostly from the perspective of a zombie, rather than a hero trying to save him/herself. The film is filled with humour, although an underlying seriousness is palpable.\n\nThe second movie is a completely different story. It&apos;s comparable to Ghost in the Shell for its cyberpunk elements as well as deep philosophy. There&apos;s no comedy here. It&apos;s the only film with no direct doomsday scenario, although the human folly is obviously present. The future presented here is most plausible and, indeed, this is likely to happen sooner or later. This film is worth watching on its own, if you want to skip the other 2.\n\nThe last film is pure absurd comedy. I personally didn&apos;t find it amusing, particularly after watching the previous one. The nonsensical idea of this movie is not helped by the fact that the plot wasn&apos;t really thought throughly, and not much effort was put into giving any sense to anything, even to the parts that supposedly help the movie unfolds (i.e.: they randomly find silly solutions out of nowhere, comparable to the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; a child playing with toys would create).\n\nAlas, I&apos;d give individual scores as follows: First movie 5/10 Second one 7/10 Final movie 2/10",

He plans to kill himself in the boiler room of the hospital while providing his best friend, the tools to bring him back to life before it&apos;s too late.\n\nThe drama and tension of the film begins from the opening credits and doesn&apos;t stop until it&apos;s over. The plot is clever and the acting believable. A must-see movie for Christian and unbeliever alike. I haven&apos;t seen any other films from DRC productions, but this one will be a tough act to follow.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Eu Me Lembro&quot; means &quot;I Remember&quot; in Portuguese, a title which recalls, of course, Fellini&apos;s &quot;Amarcord&quot;. There are also paraphrases of other Fellini films (&quot;Otto e Mezzo&quot;, &quot;I Vitelloni&quot;, &quot;...E La Nave Va&quot;) and Kusturica (&quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;) in Edgar Navarro&apos;s award-winning feature début at 56 (!!), which uses autobiographical memoirs/dreams of his childhood, adolescence and youth. Navarro shows his alter-ego Guiga going through funny/startled/clumsy/painful discoveries on sex, religion (Catholic guilt is all important here), death, love, politics, drugs and art, and above all his relationship with his flamboyant family. Like Fellini and Kusturica, Navarro makes great use of music, wacko characters and sense of humor to create a magical, dreamlike piece of nostalgia, overcoming his tiny budget and making one of the year&apos;s most endearing, personal and lyrical films.\n\nWe follow Guiga from about 5 to 20-something years of age, living in (then still) provincial Salvador (capital of the state of Bahia) from the 1950s up to the 1970s. Born into a Catholic middle-class family with a strict father, an oppressed but loving mother, a bunch of siblings and a golden-hearted housemaid, Guiga&apos;s offbeat behavior in his early childhood makes the best part of the film: a candid and very funny account of early sexuality (including masturbation scenes that may startle people who pretend Freud never existed and believe children are asexual) and the delights and pains of growing up.\n\nNavarro uses Brazilian political history as Guiga&apos;s background -- the democratic, hopeful, confident atmosphere of late 1950s; the trauma of the military coup in the 1960s culminating in the violent, repressive 1970s, the &quot;lead years&quot;, when imprisonment, torture and murder were a permanent and very real threat for students, intellectuals, artists and political activists. The film loses momentum in the (overlong) third part, as now grown-up Guiga fails to cope with the heavy political repression, the death of his beloved mother and some kind of sexual shortcoming that isn&apos;t quite clear (probably sterility), becoming increasingly erratic and emotionally unstable. Guiga chooses to &quot;drop out&quot; into flower-power, communal life and drugs -- and the film loses some of its magic as Guiga loses his Amarcordian family. But overall, &quot;Eu Me Lembro&quot; remains a enchanting journey filled with poetry, originality and humor, an unbeatable recipe.\n\n&quot;Eu Me Lembro&quot; has winning assets: a) a spot-on art direction, filled with Brazilian middle-class memorabilia of the 1950s and 1960s, which probably only Brazilians over 40 will fully enjoy; b) a soundtrack that sets the film&apos;s intense emotional tone and includes Brazilian hits from the 1940s to the 1970s (Carmen Miranda, Emilinha Borba, Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, the great and forgotten Gilberto Alves etc), classical music (there&apos;s a beautiful scene where Guiga plays Liszt&apos;s Hungarian Rhapsody n.2 in a radio show) and lovely traditional Bahia folk songs; c) colorful, offbeat dialog (the opening scene between Guiga and his mother, and the &quot;BBC&quot; routine by Maria Maluca are highlights), delivered in that sensuous, mellifluous Bahia accent; d) fine acting, especially from Arly Arnaud (warm and appealing as the Mother), Fernando Neves (making us care for the pathetic Father) and the galvanizing Dantlen Mello as the youngest Guiga, with big curious eyes belying his deadpan expression.\n\nThe fact that it took 30 years (!!) for director Edgar Navarro to get his first feature financed, produced and exhibited (he has been making award- winning shorts and videos since the 1970s), just adds to the importance of &quot;Eu Me Lembro&quot;: because he&apos;s had to wait decades to take his story to the big screen, he has painted a self-portrait that&apos;s also a portrait of a whole generation (middle-class Brazilians who are now pushing 60), a generation whose early hopes were stifled by violent military regimes, censorship and the death of utopia. It&apos;s also a story of survival: non-heroic, non- extraordinary, and with a bit of sanity and confidence lost along the way, but survival anyway. The delicate, symbolic, life-celebrating finale (à la &quot;8 1/2&quot;) restates the importance of keeping our dreams and memories alive, even (especially?) in somber times, because they may be the best we&apos;ve got left to tell the world when darkness is finally over.",

      "reviewBody": "An adaptation from Marques Rebelo novel, &quot;A Estrela Sobe&quot; (&quot;The Star Rises&quot;) is the second feature film directed by Bruno Barreto (&quot;O Que é Isso, Companheiro?&quot;) and starred by a powerful cast: Betty Faria, Paulo César Pereio, Carlos Eduardo Dolabella, Odete Lara, Roerto Bonfim and featuring cameos from Miéle and Grande Otelo. Interesting enough to make any fans of Brazilian cinema to feel curious about it. However, Barreto was too fresh and too young to helm a wide production and to transform a relative known book into something so spectacular to be seen as a movie. &quot;The Star Rises&quot; is a good film but doesn&apos;t offer anything that we haven&apos;t seen before in similar themed films revolving about a simple beautiful girl (Betty) whose biggest wish is to become a famous singer and the obstacles and the men she deals with along the way. The story is told through a flashback from his poor and simplorious life background until meetings with a record producer and others involved in the music industry.\n\nWith heavyweight names on the production the more we see them the bigger is the disappointment since the text is too simple, situations are too cliched and predictable - except the romance between the characters of Betty and Odete. It&apos;s obvious that she&apos;ll dump the love of her life (Pereio) for opportunistic yet powerful men of whom she uses them as a ladder to success. The musical numbers are very good, with the main character performing several popular songs - but I&apos;m curious to know if the actress was the actual singer or someone&apos;s was dubbing her.\n\nThe performances are good (specially Pereio playing against type, far from the nasty guys he used to play) despite the screenplay brutal simplicity. The message isn&apos;t much different from other movies but it&apos;s a product of its era and it&apos;s very believable, though not something most people would like to see. The road to success is tough, bumpy and the price one pays for it can cost the destroyal of lives or relationships. Looking at this film now, the majority of female viewers won&apos;t tolerate the ideas and situations faced by the main character or (possibly) some will regard it as a sad reality that happened and/or still happens in a misogynist world. It works as a wake-up call to little informed people about the challenges of life when one wants to make dreams come true. 6/10",

Now Sallu played his role excellent but Katrina was really, really bad in this movie? why did the director David Dhawan cast her? she clearly was not right for the part, Arshad Warshi and Isha Koppiker were also really good in this film and not to mention Sushmita, she was just brilliant, totally right for the part and played it extremely well, the music is just great too also. My favourite character would have to be the mother, now i don&apos;t want to give too much away but she was very good in the film, so funny, every time she came on screen i would burst out laughing like a 5 year old cause she was that funny, the story was crap and the ending was a bit dull and boring i think but it is a very funny film, so it&apos;s kinda worth the watch.",

For the hungarian movie standards I think it did a good job and opens the door for future mob projects (which unfortunately still didn&apos;t happen yet).\n\nMost of the actors did a good job, the movie never really got boring. What I disliked are the too long trippy visual montage scenes, but for some reason hungarian directors really love doing this. A mystery for me.\n\nIf you want to see a not so typical hungarian movie, I recommend Zuhanórepülés, as it&apos;s a descent end result.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though many films have brilliantly shown the topic of neo- Nazism and its rise in contemporary society, Kriegerin (&quot;Combat girls&quot;) focuses on the role of women in this environment. In the core of a strongly misogynistic ideology, women have to be twice as violent to impose themselves and find their own place. But it is not this exacerbate violence or hatred (even if it is realistic) that constitutes the strength of the movie, but the slowly change that takes place in Marisa thanks to an Afghan teen who she will help without really knowing why. Located in a cold economically fragile Germany, the boy will turn Marisa&apos;s life outside down. The symbolism of &quot;a life lost is a life gained&quot; is strong and the characters are colourful. The coup de grâce of the film comes from its poetry that is well-paced distilled and, between one aggression and another, manage to break through the film&apos;s cold colours, making it even more beautiful.

This Scandanavian cold case cop thriller concerns a police officer who is on a 30 year-old murder case involving the death of a 5 year old girl,while also trying to solve a more recent murder most foul. The officer is also trying to balance all of this while dealing with his own drug addicted daughter who is always trying to cage money off of her dad. Along the way, we are treated to some of Iceland&apos;s slimy criminal underworld (including those on the police force). I really admired the photography,which balances some rather bleak,wintry scenes,balanced with the rugged beauty of the Icelandic countryside (the use of muted colour really works for the tone of this rather bleak,pessimistic film). The film also makes good use of some black humour. As this film has no U.S. distribution,it will be a bit of a chore finding a cinema that screens quality films like this. No MPAA rating, but would most likely land an &apos;R&apos;, for every possible reason (raunchy language,violence,some of it pretty bloody &amp; gory,and some very adult situations). Leave the small fry&apos;s home for this one (it would probably freak them out,anyway)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;El Compadre Mendoza&quot; is a very good older Mexican film. I was actually surprised when I watched it, as the style was more subtle and well-crafted than many of the later Mexican films I&apos;ve seen. I only give it a 8 instead of a higher score simply because the ending was pretty obvious and drug on a bit too long.\n\nDon Mendoza is a rich man. However, this is a problem as it&apos;s in the midst of the Mexican Revolution under Zapata and the goal of the Zapatistas is land reform and equality for the poor. So, Mendoza does not want to antagonize the rebels and welcomes them to his home with open arms. However, after these friends leave, he also welcomes the government troops that come by his hacienda! This portion is rather comedic and seeing his servant changing portraits on the wall based on who was visiting was kind of cute. However, the mood of the film changes after Mendoza marries and has a son. One of his frequent guests and godfather to his son is a revolutionary and he and his family come to genuinely love the man. But, when Mendoza&apos;s fortunes turn for the worst, he considers making a deal...one that clearly makes Mendoza a big butt-head.\n\nOverall, this is a pleasant film and worth seeing. I particularly appreciate the fine acting in this one--very nice acting in fact.",

      "reviewBody": "The Xmas hook is irresistible to pornographers, but hack director Jakodema of Digital Playground went for &quot;insulting the audience&quot; in this 6-part attempt at lowbrow sex comedy. Its DVD version runs 208 minutes including at least 15 minutes of repeated credits for each episode, recaps and stupdly coming attractions incorrectly labeled as &quot;Previously in...&quot;.\n\nRyan Driller plays a drunken Santa, but it turns out he&apos;s the real one. His magical suit creates and removes instantly his fat belly, a gimmick to make it easier for him and replacement Santas have explicit sex with trim bodies, the male cast often hiding behind their white facial hair the way stag movie studs hid behind masks a century ago.\n\nDriller&apos;s Santa is weary of his job, delivering toys annually to &quot;nice&quot; children. He arrives at Daniel Hunter&apos;s bar and given a cool reception, but convinces Hunter and his pals Dane Cross and Tommy Pistol to pinch-hit for the night, delivering the toys. Meager special effects are included for their magical appearances and disappearances in front of fireplaces (no reindeer included in this version of the holiday myth).\n\nThe six scenes are crummy, even though they&apos;re the only reason for this exercise. One such extraneous XXX scene has Dick Chibbles as an FBI agent (explained as &quot;Female Boobs Investigator&quot; six times in a typically unfunny credit) humping Morgan Lee by a pool, having nothing to do with the rest of the show. Simlarly, Episode Six takes us back to the North Pole to watch elves Sara Luvv and Sasha Heart have Sapphic Elvish sex.\n\nThe rest is slapstick and idiotic dialog, reaching a nadir when Pistol brings up the spirit of Christmas and volunteers to replace Driller permanently as St. Nick in a fake serious/sentimental moment. Cast of innumerable beauties is wasted, including having Eva Angelina on screen for just a few seconds."

At its heart, sublime performances by Fernandel, Carette, Rosay and the strapping black servant, Lud Germain.\n\nClaude Autant-Lara directs with considerable grace and tact a film with a subject matter that could easily be mishandled and overdone.\n\nThe script is the result of inspired collaboration by Aurenche, Bost and Autant-Lara, and it is full of barbed remarks and sharp one-liners, with Catholic priest Fernandel in an unenviable position, after hearing a confession from Rosay that he must keep secret in line with his vows but which he knows can only lead to his own demise, and the demise of all guests at the hostel, if he does nothing to prevent the hostel owners&apos; murderous plans.\n\nIn the process, he is on a balancing act between serving God and saving his skin. With a performance of this caliber, it is no wonder that the following year he landed the lead in THE LITTLE WORLD OF DON CAMILLO, and is probably best remembered for that role.\n\nPhotography is outstanding, mainly indoors but with very effective outdoor sequence reliefs. Action sequences are well choreographed, and dovetail quite gracefully and cleverly.\n\nStrongly recommended.",

You flip/flop from one perspective to another, learning what the events of the movie MEAN to each character. The connections are so intricate and complex, the visual storytelling so compelling, I was just blown away by this film, and I felt the rest of the audience was right there with me.\n\nIf you&apos;ve seen and liked THE LOVER you&apos;ll like this-- it&apos;s one of those slow, languid, dreamy and beautiful movies about a true love that lasts beyond all circumstances. It&apos;s so intense one almost swoons watching it. The only other thing it reminded me of was the novel THE WHITE HOTEL. I know I sound like a huge flake, but I&apos;m not! GO see this-- and try not to hear too much about it. You&apos;ll be converted. Really an EXPERIENCE. I&apos;m saying it&apos;s the best of 1999 so far-- and I doubt I&apos;ll see anything better. GO! Now! Take a loved one!\n\n--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

      "reviewBody": "Just think that if Doris Day had not for some reason named her dog, Vladimir there might have been no plot at all for this Frank Tashlin comedy.\n\nThat might have been bad because this was the best of Doris Day&apos;s films in the late sixties as she was beginning a downward drop in her box office appeal. The Glass Bottom Boat was the second film she did with Rod Taylor as co-star and the first of two she did with Frank Tashlin as director. And this one was the best product in both associations.\n\nDoris works in public relations at a space lab in California where scientist Rod Taylor is developing new stuff for the Defense Department and NASA. She also doubles and helps her dad Arthur Godfrey on his glass bottom boat tourist vehicle. One of the things I like best about The Glass Bottom Boat is Doris sings again on screen, once in a nice duet with Arthur Godfrey on his ever present ukulele. She also sings her most famous song, Que Sera Sera once again for a new generations of film fans.\n\nOne thing about Doris&apos;s later films, she always had excellent supporting casts and this one is loaded with some very funny people like, Edward Andrews, John McGiver, Paul Lynde, Dom DeLuise, Dick Martin, George Tobias, and Alice Pearce. They all fill roles that you would expect from them.\n\nThe Glass Bottom Boat has Rod Taylor concerned with plant security in regard to his top secret work. An overzealous security guard played by Paul Lynde overhears Doris call her dog on the phone. What she does is that in order to give the pooch some exercise during the day she calls her own number, counts the rings and then says something to the unanswered phone. It&apos;s for the dog to get exercise because he runs around like a maniac when the phone rings.\n\nFrom that we deduce that Doris is a Soviet spy and the real CIA in the person of Eric Fleming is called in. This was Fleming&apos;s last big screen appearance before he was drowned on location in Peru. A very sad end to a career that might have been the equal of his Rawhide co-star, Clint Eastwood.\n\nSeeing Paul Lynde in drag, questioning an inept spy played by Dom DeLuise is worth seeing this film alone.",

Although it is a film about the deaf community, it has so much to teach us all about communication in general.\n\nFirst, the scenes with the children and how they slowly learn, not only from their teachers, but from their classmates, showing both the difficulties and joys of learning how to communicate with one another. Seeing these children courageously push forth on something so unnatural to them was inspiring. Then there are interviews with various people, young and old, each telling the story of how they dealt with being different and learning to communicate with the outside world. Then there were scenes of a cultural exchange program of French and American students that was both touching and inspiring, with the students forming a bond that will last them a lifetime. and Finally, the film documents the marriage of a deaf couple&apos;s, their wedding day, their apartment hunting and the birth of their child, all shown so sensitively by Philibert as to inspire all of us to be kinder human beings. This is a first-rate documentary, providing us insight on the deaf, and making each of their stories universal.\n\nI must say that Philibert has a knack of finding interesting people in his documentaries, especially teachers and children. In TO BE AND TO HAVE and this film, the main teachers look surprising alike, tall, graying,balding men with beards with immense amount of patience and passion for teaching. And the children in both these films are all so wonderful.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;O Ano em Que Meus Pais Saíram de Férias&quot; is the most important Brazilian export of 2007, and as many said, a strong contender for the Academy Awards. The movie was beautiful: the cinematography, the music, the actors. The scenery was perfectly created and it looked perfectly like São Paulo and Brazil in the 1970&apos;s. With all that, the movie still failed to excite me or create any major emotion. The movie was very flat, and ran without a climax. Plus I wasn&apos;t very familiar with the 70&apos;s history, and the fact that the movie doesn&apos;t go deeper into the issues of the time got me a bit confused. I recommend a little researching prior to watching the movie. Overall, the movie was OK, but the characterization should have been developed further and some kind of bigger conflict should have brought excitement to the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "LIKES:\n\nPace is Entertaining: A comedy is all about moving parts and cramming jokes, at least that is what Hollywood thinks. Well, for those that like the style of lots of jokes in hopes they will hit, you&apos;ve got your wish in this film. It&apos;s an adorable comedy with lots of quirks to latch onto, finding either the plot or subplots to provide lanes of comedy that they exchange throughout the movie. And all of this moves at speed that captivates the time period of one day for a visit. If that is the desire, then this will be one of the strongest aspects.\n\nThe Acting Is decent: This feels like several of Adam Sandler or Martin Lawrence comedies, where a lot of people form an on stage community. While no Oscar winning roles or mind blowing performances, the acting does establish the basic chemistry you expect and adds a little bit of the forced humor into it. It works like a standup comedy or SNL sketch, everyone adding that theatrical touch to the mix to help overemphasize the humor. Yet, you really do feel a bit of a connection between them that in the end really comes out. For the top billed actors Wardell is fine. A bit out of place compared to the others, but he plays the awkward teenager phase okay that really tightened up when he meets someone his own age to interact with. Lydia Gaston was very authentic as an overbearing mother, but the comedy aspect, while funny, did not mix as well as I think they thought it would when they did the writing. Still in the matriarch movie role, she did manage to get many qualities down that I enjoyed pulling things down together. As for Jo Koy, he&apos;s fun, funny, and a bit of the jack of All Trades in this movie, being funny and sentimental at times. It&apos;s not the most dynamic, but he does mix well with just about everyone in this comedy scene and we can see how they sort of made a fun skit pulling everyone together. Overall, it&apos;s okay, and works for the theme of the movie.\n\nFun Cameos: A nice surprise when people pop into the movie, Easter Sunday has a few players added to the mix to make the venue fun. I won&apos;t reveal them, but the three who broke into the movie and added a little spice, really did it well. Their use in the movie was very balanced, and though a bit short lived, held enough sustenance to make their stent in the show worth the investment in their characters. And to add a little diversity to the linear level of ridiculousness, it works very well.\n\nClever Comedy At Times: Like mentioned above, the comedy can be really spot on in terms of their jabs at various things. The cameos were my favorites, but there were a few other times that I got the relevance of the joke and really enjoyed it&apos;s place in the minutia of comedy. As for the comedic delivery, sometimes it&apos;s timed so well, with that finesse taking advantage of the timing, I could not help by laugh at everything coming together.\n\nMusic is Decent: A good soundtrack can really help make a good movie and this film again has some decent tunes to liven things up. Some festive music helps with the cultural aspects and some of them get your toes a tapping. However, there are other tunes that ring in that again feel very in tune with the fee of the movie, including a karaoke cover that is entertaining, funny, and of course may get you to listen to the classic song like I did. Thus, while not the best soundtrack, again it is very fun for me.\n\nRelevant Family Drama: Now the meat of the movie, is the relevance and focus on family and how it works in the grand scheme of things. Easter Sunday&apos;s small section of members was very relevant to me and reminded me so much of the antics I faced growing up in a family as close as this. This film really showed off the intensity that comes with a tight knight group, traditions clashing with modern trends and strong personalities vying for dominance. Sometimes it drifts apart, while other times it drives them closer, it&apos;s the soap opera style of drama that you may or may not see in your home. If that&apos;s something intriguing to you, then this movie is going to be so well-received, as you sort of relive the slice of familial life. What they accomplish is poking fun and slipping in those moments that help you laugh off the tension, almost like that wacky uncle who comes to the dinner. This is the core foundation of this film and at times it is very endearing to help with the moral testing quality of the movie. And other times, it&apos;s being used as the cultural representation card that will bridge the gap and make the comedy better.\n\nQuick Run Time: And above all else, everything I have mentioned is summed up that this is a quick run time and you don&apos;t have to spend too long watching. I was out of their very quickly when the movie completed I can&apos;t say much more to this, but all this wraps up to a time commitment that is less intensive and is a good way to kill time if you need it.\n\nDISLIKES: Predictable To A Fault: A movie that has too much prediction and foreshadowing can take the punch out of a lot of things they were planning. For me, they led the comedy and story by the nose, lines selling the twists that were happening an hour down the road. After about twenty five minutes, I had the rest of the comedy devices down with the exception of a few outliers shoved in. All this made the movie a bit boring for me, but for those who can turn their minds off and just enjoy this may not be an issue.\n\nToo Many Story Lines, Not Enough attention: We&apos;ve seen plenty of family dramas that tackle certain problems. In many of these, stories are balanced well so that they all have a place, but maybe don&apos;t get all the attention to allow for a natural flowing tale. Not the case for me with Easter Sunday. Several big plot points act as the focal points of the film, and each new point gets passed over like a baton that is then picked up with another baton. They try to stay in tandem, but for me, many were dropped and kind of had to be packed back up and developed sporadically. The flow was not there like the first twenty five minutes were, and solutions to the problems were a bit too quick to get to the races. While it again fits the idea of family matters and dynamics, as a story with emotional mastery it did not do so well for me. This led to a weaker story and sadly that&apos;s not what I had hoped when I saw the trailer for this.\n\nThe Pace is Also a Weakness: Much of the last dislike was due to this one. While the pace is entertaining and gets us to the end quicker, it itself also limits what they could have done. One of the subplots sort of pokes at this, and symbolizes how TV shows are the perfect medium for the familial culture to be shown. That felt very true to me when I was watching this film, that there needed to be a twenty something episode season to handle all the drama and plots they wanted, with two other seasons as well. It gives you a taste, and who knows, it might just be turned into a series knowing entertainment today. However, for a 90-minute rough runtime, the movie was sort of cursed with very crammed plots and gimmicks.\n\nJokes Are a Little Too Stand Up/In Your Face: And like many things on streaming, this movie felt even more forced with jokes. Quantity over quality in many cases, it was like Koy and the writers were throwing darts with different styles attached to them at a board and hoping it would stick with you. Koy randomly has a stand-up routine in the opening part of the movie, which works, but then the rest of the time it feels out of place. Other times, the other serious actors have to break their roles or try to shuffle out into comedy, and it just doesn&apos;t feel natural to the character leading to it being a bit meh. The point is the amount of jokes got a bit stale and need more planning and time to space out and maximize the talent in this movie.\n\nCheesy To a Fault: We all know cheesy jokes have their place and cheesy delivery does things well too. However, Easter Sunday again goes too far down this road to the point where it either is annoying or ruins what could have been a good line delivered had it been delivered differently. Again, SNL knows how to balance this well, but Easter Sunday may have treaded too far down this path to really maximize this comedy style for me.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nOverall, Easter Sunday is okay in my book. It&apos;s mundane and a little bit of a mixture of chaos that the movie actually quotes and in some cases that chaos works well. It&apos;s relevant for those who know the culture or have a family like this, finding ways to mix drama and comedy that will be great if you turn your mind off. The movie stays at a fast pace through all of it, so this should appeal to those with little time or just needing a time killer to momentarily shut off their brain. However, in doing so, they rob a lot of the quality that the movie could have had. Mixing all the storylines, the comedy styles, and in such a tight package did not work, again needing a sitcom series to really get this kind of humor out. Still, a home watch with friends or family might be a fun in house date night, which is where this movie will be maximized at.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nComedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5.",

      "reviewBody": "The reason for my heading above is self-explanatory. I mean for those of you who are well- versed with many Hollywood movies like THE SIXTH SENSE and WHAT LIES BENEATH, well, this movie is almost the exact replica of what those two movies are. The idea for KHURAFAT was somewhat &quot;copied&quot; from those films.\n\nThis film also &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas from Japanese horror flicks like THE RING and JU-ON. So without much explanation, KHURAFAT still maintains the order of horror in place in tuned to the Asian taste for what supernatural horror is. This last remark is in view of the Asian psyche where realms of the unknowns remains not only as a mystery but a mystical fascination in every Asian.\n\nOne conspicuous thing that I observed is the similarity between KHURAFAT and JANGAN PANDANG BELAKANG (whose main lead of the latter film, Pierre Andre, was also the writer and director of the film) in that the &quot;entities&quot; looked pretty much the same; the gory make- ups and costumes. Even the premises of both films made use of almost the same Malay folklore of Hantu Pelesit (&quot;Inheritance Demon&quot;).\n\nNevertheless, the brilliance of KHURAFAT is how Syamsul Yusof tweaked the sophistication of those Hollywood movies mentioned above to compel Asian audience particularly the Malays.\n\nFor one thing, Malay movies, in general, follow a straightforward storyline without much twists nor requiring the audience&apos;s participation to think about how each piece of the movie puzzle comes together. But this Syamsul Yusof&apos;s tour-de-force is indeed the first to break that traditional convention and compel the audience to think about the pieces together.\n\nI, for one, am both at a lost but impressed at how Syamsul Yusof managed to construct such wonderful script that comprised an intricate weave of mystery without leaving any clues along the way. The truth could only be known right at the end of the movie...and THAT, I think, is the fresh and original idea - that is, not leaving any breadcrumbs for the audience to pick up any clues whatsoever but instead making them stay riveted to the screen till the end.\n\nKUDOS TO SYAMSUL YUSOF!!!\n\nBy the way, with a film that comes attached with warning saying &quot;Expectant mothers and people of poor heart conditions are advised not to see this film&quot; such as this who could resist not watching it. It bounds to make dig deep into the human curiosity."

The greatest example of this is Boguslaw Linda as Robak the Priest. In the most moving scene in the film he gives the performance of his life.\n\nThe harmonious blend of Wajda&apos;s direction and Wojciech Kilar&apos;s score is a sensual feast. It is a film which impresses a profound sense of beauty to such an extent that one could appreciate the sheer art of the film without even having to understand the language (I cannot vouch for the quality of the sub-titles in English as I saw it in its original version).\n\nIf you only see one foreign language film this year, make sure it is this one.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I was a teenager myself, and I remember feeling a just a little shortchanged and even dirty, like I&apos;d been manipulated in a way. I did enjoy it, but the reasons for enjoying it do not hold up today. Watching it again has been fun because looking at it through adult eyes, I am having fun seeing how easy it is to spot the dated qualities and outmoded philosophies that, as one reviewer said, were pretty much defunct by 2000, or maybe even by 1995-6. \n\nAnd it&apos;s not like I was some profound kid who had all this insight how mass media sells these ideas to young people...I bought into the whole &quot;Seattle grunge&quot; thing lock, stock and barrel, I thought guys with stringy unwashed hair and bad attitudes were totally hot, I wore crocheted vests, mood rings, and colored sunglasses with the best of them. So me thinking that something did not ring true must have been because it is pretty obvious that this movie is in essence a failure.\n\n1. The characters-The movie works really hard to make Troy be the better option for Leilana. For teenagers, he was totally sexy to watch on screen and totally swoon worthy, but his utterly obnoxious attitude, his rudeness to Ben Stiller&apos;s character, and his bullying just came off as unpleasant at the least, and his philosophy for not working are textbook definitions of a narcissist. Hearing some of his pseudo intellectual discussions are painful and embarrassing, because it is clear that the movie feels that young Gen X&apos;ers embrace and admire such outlooks unequivocally and at face value. And kids were supposed to identify with this person? What an inconsiderate person, to stand up Leilana&apos;s father for the job interview and lead her to blame herself, and to embarrass women around him for being attracted to him. Any good friend and countless therapists would advise against having him as a boyfriend. The sad few seconds devoted to his dying father are not enough to redeem him or &quot;understand&quot; him. \n\nBottom line, if Ethan Hawke was supposed to make this person somewhat sympathetic, he failed, or if he truly was supposed to be this unlikable, then good work. \n\nLeilana did come off as sympathetic and overall was well played by Winona, and her beauty is the one of the few things in this movie with true staying power. Her character does some pretty awful things, though. When her boss rudely rebuffs her video ideas, she humiliates him on air. When her friend offers her a job, she snaps at her. Instead of swallowing her pride and working at the gap for a bit, she resorts to the embarrassing &quot;gas card&quot; scene, which we are supposed to think is cute and rebellious. It is totally unconvincing that a &quot;valedictorian&quot; would ever be so irresponsible and immature, even if she had fallen on bad times.\n\nAs for the other two, they are both well acted and likable, but seem to be added on simply to achieve a gritty &quot;90&apos;s&quot; edge, like HIV testing and coming out to your parents. Neither subplot is developed enough to give this movie the edge it craves. Both are attractive and funny, and Vicky especially projects a friendliness, sympathy, and is cute as hell in those throwback clothes. \n\n2. The Michael stuff really is a failure. Ben Stiller did a good job acting in this movie and came across as warm and real, but this movie is his work too. I guess a simple plot device would have been to make him more arrogant from the get-go so that he could seem like the &quot;bad guy&quot; but that would have been cheap. Either way, the movie does seem like it&apos;s trying to convince you that he either &quot;betrays&quot; Leilana or &quot;doesn&apos;t understand her&quot; the way Troy does, and it doesn&apos;t work. Those two had a positive chemistry and seemed to complement each other as characters. To make this a true coming of age and growing up story, Leilana should have either chosen Michael, who emphasizes growing up, taking responsibility for your actions, and change for the better, or decided to be on her own for a while to become a more mature person. \n\n3. The biggest failure of this movie, and in my opinion, the most dangerous, is how it elevates Troy&apos;s attitude as the noble one above all, as if being narcissistic and self-involved are desirable. Being that he is the hot guy of the movie and that the other characters seem to respond so positively to him, a young teenager is left with the message that this is the &quot;new&quot; way to be and that Michael&apos;s responsible and kind persona are &quot;hypocritical&quot; or &quot;selling out.&quot; Leaving the theater back in &apos;94, I was enjoying myself thinking about the romance between two good looking and stylish characters, but I couldn&apos;t really get into that part as much as I should have. Since I also really wanted to be cool and up to date, I was wondering if I should be acting or living like any of these characters, living in a flat with a guy who mooches off me, sleeping around with strangers, dancing at the gas station, etc. The movies have a lot more influence on young people than one thinks. \n\nIn my gut, I felt two things: a-My parents would be horrified if I brought friends like that around and more frighteningly, b-I secretly would agree with them."

It has all the four movies, so I watched Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation this afternoon and once again after looking at the IMDb rating, I was a bit scared on what to expect, but so far, I&apos;m really liking these movies. Yeah, they&apos;re a bit ridicules, not to mention that I think Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation took a different direction than the original Nerd film, but it&apos;s all good. I thought it was actually a fun story and a new introduction of all nerds uniting together and showing who really takes care of the jocks in the world.\n\nLewis has now turned himself into a huge stud and is living with his wife, Betty. His nephew and his nephew&apos;s friend have gone to the same college and have joined the Lamb&apos;s, but we have a new dean in town, Stan is back! He and an alumni of the school are joining together to ban all nerds from the town. The nerds call on Lewis to get back to his nerd roots and help them take over the town, hopefully Lewis can get past this silly smooth operator appearance, because it&apos;s not working for him or the nerds that need him most.\n\nRevenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation is nothing special, but it still has a few laughs. I really didn&apos;t think it was bad, at least not as bad as the rating would on IMDb led me on. Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation is just a fun movie that I think people need to be open too, it&apos;s a different direction in the story but it works over all. So just give it a shot, I think you&apos;ll actually enjoy this story, after all, everyone&apos;s gotta love the nerds.\n\n5/10",

The story sometimes borrows themes from other &apos;road movies&apos; which are fairly familiar, but the unique characters in the movie make this road movie unique in its own very strange way. Russell Crowe a la sideburns is still very cool, yet he does not dominate each scene as he has done in every movie he has made in the past 5 years. His somewhat understated presence allows his co-star Yidori (?) shine - a wonderful Japanese actress whose ingénue childlike looks contrast sharply with her bizarre change or metamorphosis from the gentle opening scenes. The classical musical romantic score is placed in a wild funny contrast to the plot,sometimes in a very campy way--yet it still works. This is not a great movie or a classic--but it has the zany features of movies like &quot;TRUE ROMANCE&apos;, (a cult classic) I would highly recommend this movie for what it it is -- a wild action packed funny bizarre ride with a good run of crazy people--- This movie may be a 10 if you view it the Austrailian way --with a keg of good beer--wish I &apos;d seen this movie on the big screen but I don&apos;t recall this movie in the theater years ago-Enjoy--there are even a few good lines that will make you want to go back to it someday so a DVD purchase would not be wasted....",

Also the Father&apos;s prize pupil Whitey (Mickey Rooney) goes to live with a foster family and gets into trouble, thanks to a pint-sized tough guy (Darryl Hickman).\n\nGood sequel to Boys Town reunites Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, as well as a few of the kid actors who were in the last film. Henry Hull&apos;s part is recast with, of all people, Lee J. Cobb in one of his first significant roles. Rooney&apos;s star had risen since 1938 and in many ways he was more of the star of this one than Tracy was. Darryl Hickman is so cute as the little hoodlum Flip. He really steals the movie. A little long and the plot&apos;s kind of scattered but it&apos;s enjoyable and pleasant with lots of tear-jerking moments.",

The film is, in some ways, a work of origami too, for it&apos;s folded into different sections, and the whole is even greater than the sum of its parts. If you can catch it at a film festival, don&apos;t miss it. And I&apos;m sure this film, by a talented first-time filmmaker, will end up in other venues, win awards, and hopefully someday be available on DVD.",

Although, she did have nice breasts... which was the only redeeming quality of this flick, gratuitous nudity. Especially in the case of one Eve Mauro. That girl is absolutely gorgeous. Smokin&apos; hot! I think I would probably watch anything with her in it, at least once. But alas, I digress from my original reason for writing this.\n\n&quot;Candyman&quot;, &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;, &quot;Warlock&quot; and Brandi Svennings dad all in one movie? They obviously did not invest wisely of their spoils from their actual roles in real movies... That, or the director/writer/producer caught and filmed them all in some suck-off man orgy together and blackmailed them into making this horrible movie.\n\nActually a documentary on fecal matter would probably be more entertaining than this movie is...\n\nIf you&apos;re a guy and thinking about watching this movie, punch yourself in the balls... really hard. That pain is as enjoyable as this movie is going to be for you. If you&apos;re a girl, rinse your eyes with vodka. Same goes...\n\nI will never understand how something as bad as this gets made. Along the line, people kept giving this the green light. HOW? The actors and actresses agreed to be in it. WHY? Distributors agreed to release it. Again I ask, in F&apos;s-name WHY? The economy is steadily slipping, but it seems the movie industry will throw copious amounts of cash to whatever idiot comes along. (I bet the screenplay was written in crayon.) I think &quot;Clerks&quot; cost a little over fifty grand to make. No actors, no sets and lastly, no color. Taking all of that into account, this movie at the very least, probably cost a cool quarter mil. WTF?!?! Are you serious?!?! In this day and age, Jake Whatever-his-name-is should be lynched for wasting that much money. Like rappers and athletes buying gold and platinum jewelry/teeth/wheels... but that&apos;s a whole other rant...\n\nI give it two stars. One for each of Eve Mauro&apos;s wonderful breasts. Nothing else.",

I don&apos;t know why, but when Hollywood makes a movie about kids and animals they seem obsessed with making your kid cry. This Norwegian film will actually make your kid laugh, and you too, there is one sort of sad part but it&apos;s expected, and not even Kim cries in the scene.\n\nFor some folks in the USA the subtitles might be a bit of a pain, but the movie is worth it. Don&apos;t expect to rent this one at your local video store though, if you want a copy you&apos;ll probably have to order one for purchase, but it&apos;s worth it.",

To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.\n\nThe film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it&apos;s viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.\n\nThe movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting. \n\nSo if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off.",

The film&apos;s brisk pacing was  perfectly suited to its theme, thanks to director Peyton Reed, the writing smart, sharp, and consistently and authentically funny,(as well as, at times, genuinely thought-provoking)thanks to writer Jessica Bendinger, and the acting solid all around. I also liked &quot;Bring It On&quot; for what it didn&apos;t have-alot of tired, cliched boy-girl relationship stuff, and/or gratuitous sex/nudity. The opening dream/cheer sequence was a moment of sheer, brilliant comic/satiric movie magic, and later, when the professional choreographer shows up to help the Toros out, he almost steals the show. But what impressed me, perhaps, most of all about &quot;Bring It On&quot; was the wonderful chemistry between the two beautiful-and talented-young female leads, Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku.",

The idea of a perfect car, that didn&apos;t need petrol, being kept under wraps ready to become THE world car, seen in every country but then being hijacked by people with a vested interest in seeing it disappear should have been gripping.  It wasn&apos;t. The entire film was an incoherent, noisy mess and some of the dubbed voices were so flat it was impossible to believe in the characters. Juergen Prochnow, who obviously did his own dubbing, spent most of the movie in a thoroughly surly mood - much how I felt after I&apos;d seen it - and lacked his usual charisma although he rushed around very convincingly.  The movie was too long, and by the end I really didn&apos;t care what happened to the car, Prochnow or the ideals behind it all.  Maybe it lost something in the translation, but for me it completely missed the mark.  Don&apos;t bother unless you&apos;re desperate to see Prochnow and/or Senta Berger get their clothes off.",

Meanwhile, another team of mobsters working for the same boss try to track down a stash of cash hidden by the daughter&apos;s ex-boyfriend (the stuntman who was killed). If this plot sounds rather complicated, that&apos;s because it is!"

Set in 1988 just before the Yugoslavian conflict the story follows the fortunes of Rick (Brad Pitt) in meeting with a young American girl whilst suffering from a potentially fatal skin disease.\n\nSet in a small town on the Adriatic the film is beautifully shot and is worth anyones time and money who appreciate a well made film professionally acted.\n\nJust watch for that part of the film covering the final three days - it is not predictable. On top of all this the history of the film is intriguing - shortly after the film was finished the completed work went missing only to be discovered 6 years later after the Yugoslavian conflict ended in 1996. The Director(check him out) certainly had his work cut out in obtaining distributors for what by then was rated as a poor performance from an established actor.\n\nEspecially watch for some close resemblances to Joe Black. The music was good too.\n\nTorson Falcradine 20:ii:MMV (c)T Falcradine",

Perhaps just that special touch that signals, &quot;either you&apos;ve got it or you haven&apos;t.&quot;\n\nWhatever the case, Louise pleads, cajoles, rants and raves for David the entire film.  What does our David do?--merely tell Louise the truth: that he&apos;s simply not in love with her.\n\nGranted, David&apos;s rather flippant, self-absorbed and bored, but that&apos;s his prerogative.  Instead of accepting this and moving on with her life, Louise insists on minding David&apos;s old business and clinging to bygone days.\n\n All this &quot;to-do,&quot; when a simple scan of a Dale Carnegie text might have solved the problem.\n\nLouise does have her supporters: young stepdaughter Carol and aging hubbie Dean do what they can to bolster Louise&apos;s confidence.  Since Geraldine Brooks and Raymond Massey portray these respective roles, there&apos;s sure to be strong convictions expressed.\n\nMade just two years after her Oscar-winning turn in &quot;Mildred Pierce,&quot; Crawford is in her mature mettle here. Although the same title was used for a Crawford film 16 years earlier, the similarity is in name only. \n\n &quot;Possessed&quot; allows Joan to suffer royally and she does, pulling out all the schizophrenic stops to slam this one home.  Since no one reels better than Crawford, it&apos;s an engaging performance in an engrossing film."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Night Train&apos; is sort of a chamber movie that takes place in the compartments of a train. Made at a low budget (which actually works to its benefits), the film uses glowing lights. This adds to the tense atmosphere and mystery element and the bright colours used within the train compartments bring a feeling of illusion. The story starts off interesting but is downright predictable not to forget the typical Hollywood ending which brings the film down by a huge notch. Acting is okay. Danny Glover is restrained (which is quite unexpected of such films). Steve Zahn&apos;s Pete is a caricature but the actor infuses some humour and provides comic relief. Leelee Sobieski is good in the beginning but her performance heads towards &apos;cliched psychopath&apos; as the film proceeds. Overall, in terms of story it doesn&apos;t offer anything new and there are plenty of plot holes but what I liked about it was the atmosphere within the train compartments. It sort of looks like a noire film in colour. The use of bright colours, the strange passengers, the characters: salesman, med student and ticket conductor and music create contribute to this bizarre atmosphere. I also liked how the wooden box was symbolically used. Pandora&apos;s box is the first thing that comes to mind and the writer could have done so much with it, but alas!"

Superficially the scenes mite come out dry but look closer and you will see the reality that is staring you in your face. there is not adulteration of scenes by strong music.. just the raw reality.. Some of the scenes which seem shallow ..that is what it would be like in reality... it is slowly after the build up that the story starts to unfold... Aishwarya has pulled off the role of Umrao exceptionally well. The lyrics touch your heart with songs like &quot;Pooch rahe hain&quot;. \n\nShabana Azmi has played every emotion with such authenticity.. she comes out as a mother, a shrewd woman.. protecting her sanctuary... Aishwarya has repeated her excellent performance of Raincoat here. Kudos to J.P. Dutta",

      "reviewBody": "In June of 2005, the Finnish embassy and the MHz channel arranged a special showing of the RAID sequel at the AFI Silver, just outside Washington DC. We stood in line surrounded by enthusiastic Finnish-Americans. Kai Lehtinen and Tapio Piirainen had flown in, signed autographs and posed for snapshots with fans.\n\nThe film delivered most of our favorite characters in another involved political conspiracy with economic consequences. Running gags from the series were continued in the film. It was hard to judge if the film was funnier than the series, or if the enthusiastic crowd made it seem more humorous. \n\nThe events in the series were fictional, but believable. Raid was still the talented and instinctive hero, and Uki, Tarja, Jansson and Sundman were still very believable characters; the actions they took were plausible enough to suspend disbelief. Sundman&apos;s relationship with a plump model was intriguing.\n\nThis film was more action-packed, but it was more difficult to believe that the climactic events could have occurred without serious repercussions for Raid and his cohort. And the film&apos;s villain wasn&apos;t as memorable as Hammar.\n\nAfter the showing, Lehtinen laughed a lot while he and Piirainen fielded questions from the stage. Kai seemed very surprised and flattered to be a hit in America, but was grounded enough to brush off any talk of leaving Finland to pursue a Hollywood career.",

Not only does it feature the usual stars like Stacy Jones, Schemer, and Ringo Starr as Mr. Conductor but we also get a great role from Lloyd Bridges, guest-starring as Mr. Nicholas, a mysterious man who ends up touching a little girl&apos;s life, teaching her the true meaning of Christmas and giving. The discussions and interactions between those two are what makes the film as great as it is. Schemer trying to win over the votes of everyone in the station to elect him as Santa&apos;s helper is what gives the film a very funny side as well. The entire cast singing &quot;&apos;Tis a Gift&quot; (the folk song after which the film is titled) is the true highlight of this one hour special. This is a rare film not to be missed. Find it, watch it, and continue to enjoy seeing it year after year.\n\n***1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "With Melville&apos;s death, Tavernier and Corneau became the masters of French film noir, but the latter has the dreamlike mood that the genre really needs to be effective. Le choix des armes has many effective scenes (usually involving either Depardieu or Lanvin) but sometimes leaves us cold. There is a little too much exposition in the storytelling--why show us Montand and his buddy smashing up the gang lord&apos;s opulent house when there is no dramatic effect to be gained? Or the elaborate four-way car pursuit (did the budget allow for all those stunt-drivers, so Corneau thought Why not?).\n\nThe acting is mostly exceptional. The young Gérard Lanvin gives us a very frustrated young detective, Michel Galabru is his burnt-out superior, Richard Anconina plays a man trying to settle down to happy domesticity and failing, and Depardieu is simply great as Mickey le dingue, crazy and moving at the same time. The woman who plays Dany&apos;s wife with burning resentment takes over every scene she&apos;s in.",

      "reviewBody": "R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie, but he&apos;s trying to remember his human life. He&apos;s barely about to grunt a word out, and he has a friend (Rob Corddry) sort of. While hunting, R runs into human Julie. He falls for the girl, and saves her from the zombie pack.\n\nThere are a lot of zombie movies out there. I mean aaaalottttt. So it&apos;s not surprising that people are trying to explore a more expansive zombie universe. Zombies are faster, slower, funnier, and parodied. Now zombies are falling in love.\n\nIt&apos;s something new. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s funny. It&apos;s not. It is curious, and somewhat sweet. Nicholas Hoult is a good emo zombie. The difficulty lies with the grunting halting speech. It makes the dialog hard to listen to. This makes the interior narration absolutely vital. It was probably important to try even more internal dialog.\n\nAs for Teresa Palmer, I&apos;m not sure she&apos;s star material. She&apos;s a really pretty girl. I really like her, but I still see her as the girlfriend character. The other girl in the movie is Analeigh Tipton. She might be marginally better as the lead. She seems to have a little more comedic skills.\n\nI am very happy that people aren&apos;t just doing the same old zombie movie over and over again. This story had obvious obstacles. I think it overcame most of them relatively well.",

I have lived in the Netherlands and love the Dutch people, so I was happy to view this film and see many familiar sites and understand some of the Dutch dialogue. It provided me with a sense of deja vu. I also learned things about the Dutch World War II experience that I previously was unaware of. The vast majority of the world only has one thought when it comes to WWII and the Dutch: Anne Frank. It&apos;s heartening to watch a film that explores many other facets of the Dutch experience during occupation, and that doesn&apos;t promote an all-rosy view wherein everyone is heroic. It is a realistic film that showed the complications of war and occupation, the desire for self-survival, the limits of patriotism, the fragility of war-time romances, and the bravery and sacrifices that some, but not all, are willing to exhibit. My heart was in my throat many times as I wondered what would happen and, although the movie is almost two and a half hours, I was sorry to see it end."

Those who follow current events and witnessed the shocking video of a meteorite striking violently into Siberia will certainly see the prophetic aspects of this film. The deadly spores on the cinematic meteorite, however, are deadly and it is essential the world take notice of what happens in this incredible motion picture. The Siberian strike in recent years could easily have brought an apocalyptic presence to those who live in the isolated area of Russia and the terror would have been overwhelming. Perhaps we were very lucky or we may just might know yet. With skill and dramatic insight, Maxsim has envisioned what may well of happened if the merciless universe had chosen to destroy humanity. The all-too- possible scenario is expertly filmed and the ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. The Russian location of an abandoned factory is a perfect setting for the story to play out and Maxsim&apos;s technical genius with the camera makes for an environment both mesmerizing and horrific. The result is a film that is realistic, inspired, and a disturbing omen of what could easily be.",

      "reviewBody": "I would say that Nanban is one of the few remake movies which is emerging as a huge response from all sides it has been released.Shankar has done a great job of giving justice to the original version 3 idiots as he has transformed the movie adapting to Tamil fans without any of the plus points of the block buster Hindi movie.The message about education conveyed through this movie is really good and It is seriously an eye opener to many of the educational institutions and family !!!\n\nMoving on to the performance of various characters. Vijay has given his best ever performance till date. He has given a massive come back after some critics against him and also his acting in this kind of movies rocks more than his mass commercial movies.And as Shankar said &quot;After watching this film, even an antivijay fan would become his fan&quot; has come true as i saw in most of my friends.\n\nJeeva too taking up the role of Sarman joshi, has acted nice in all parts especially in that humour sequences encountered with Sathya raj. Shrikanth has done justice to his character fitting into the shoes of Madhavan.\n\nIleana&apos;s performance looks a bit less compared to Kareena kapoor but has done good in some scenes.Sathyan as Silencer has completely satisfied his role compared to the Hindi version. Sathya Raj though in certain suitations imitates the Hindi version character but has really done a superb job in this movie as he is the best option to take up this role.\n\nOf all the songs in the movie,&quot;Askku laska&quot; and &quot;En frienda pola yaaru machan&quot; seems to be the winners.Locations and camera works in the movie gives us a fresh look to the movie.This movie is the Best Option for celebrating Pongal With a Message.\n\nFinally This will be Super HIT Block Buster movie for sure!!!\n\nAnd a Hattrick For VIJAY !! PongALL IZZ WELL !!",

We watch and enjoy a lot of children&apos;s films - this was the worst for a long time, since Space Chimps probably, and made worse by that it could have been so much better with a little craft to its direction. And from a director with so much experience as an Editor, it was really badly edited.\n\nMy 6 year old thought it was OK, but there lies the problem - the film is obviously aimed, in its semi-high-school American &apos;teen rock&apos; music pretensions, at a much older audience. A porous plot, even to an 8 year old, and the embarrassing potential of the cast falls extremely flat. Mathew Horne seems only to have two expressions in his repertoire and is in extreme danger of having a bit part comedy career fade fast. Anjelica Huston&apos;s Scottish accent was insulting and embarrassing - like a sheltered American impersonating Mrs Doubtfire. Horrid Henry clean cut and Americanised, really wasn&apos;t very menacing at all. I was surprised we were spared the sentimental &apos;son, I got it all wrong but I will always love you&apos; ending: it would have completed the American airbrushing.",

      "reviewBody": "Chhoti Si Baat is for me the ultimate romantic comedy of those times - simple, funny and totally charming. Basu Chatterjee was an amazing talent. Like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, he used to make films that reflected the lives of people from the middle-class. Everything in this film is kept simple and contributes to its authenticity, including dialogues, characters, sets, props and costumes. Chatterjee brilliantly captures the world of Arun, an ordinary and rather insecure fellow who is deeply in love with a young and beautiful girl named Prabha. The story follows Arun&apos;s trials and tribulations and his later attempts to get her through the help and guidance of a love-guru, when another guy enters the picture. It&apos;s amazing how the viewers are given a chance to witness and experience every thought, yearning and disappointment that the character of Arun is going through, and yet the movie remains consistently humorous, lighthearted and comic.\n\nI think that&apos;s what makes both the film and particularly the character of Arun so easy to relate to. I think everyone has been at some point secretly in love and could not express his feelings. And clearly this would not be so believable without Amol Palekar&apos;s great portrayal. Palekar&apos;s comically melancholic performance is wonderful. He never tries to do more than required or over-express his deep feelings. And yet it is always understood. This is easily one of his best. Vidya Sinha is beautiful and ever so graceful that it&apos;s easy to understand why she is the love interest here. Asrani is not the type of guy who would really look like a serious rival who could undermine one&apos;s confidence, but he is inevitably funny and suitably annoying. Ashok Kumar is just outstanding in a role which is quite different from his usual ventures. As the witty and kind Colonel Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh, he is hilarious, likable and memorable.\n\nSome of the film&apos;s scenes are still remembered today, including the sequences showing Arun daily following Prabha on her way to her workplace. The lively streets of the yet-unconjested Bombay are efficiently shot and are nostalgic to look at. The scenes involving Arun and the love-guru Julius are of the best moments in the film, while Arun&apos;s transformation afterwards and his renewed interaction with Prabha is incredibly entertaining. Salil Choudhury&apos;s soundtrack for the film is beautiful. In another evident attempt to keep the film realistic, the songs are not visualised as one would expect in a Hindi film. The songs either play over montage sequences (&quot;Na Jaane Kyun&quot; and &quot;Yeh Din Kyaa Aaye&quot;) or appear as part of a film the characters go to see in the cinema (the wonderful &quot;Jaanemann&quot;). In either way, they express the characters&apos; state of mind brilliantly. Overall, Chhoti Si Baat is one classic gem to remember. Go now.",

      "reviewBody": "Hypnotist&apos;s faithless wife is murdered and cops suspect him until a likelier suspect emerges who may or may not be guilty.\n\nOld radio fans no doubt recognize the Inner Sanctum origins of this film and the series that followed. Those old radio half-hours emphasized the mysterious and the darkly psychological and were nearly always entertaining. (In fact, I think the origins of post-war noir lie as much in these radio shows as they do in the better-known movie precursors.) Fortunately, this series, like its radio namesake, trades on the offbeat and chilling, and though these programmers fail to reach the memorable level of Columbia&apos;s comparable Whistler entries, the Inner Sanctum movies have their own virtues and are worth catching up with.\n\nThis first entry doesn&apos;t really grab until the last 15 minutes or so. Then it takes off with a surprise ending and especially with the surreal dream sequence. There&apos;s one got&apos;cha in the sequence that shows real imagination. Yes, the storyline doesn&apos;t always make sense and I&apos;m still puzzled by some of the relationships. Then too, looks to me like Chaney&apos;s not too interested in his part as the psychologist. Catch that one confrontational scene with faithless wife Maria (Ames) where both deliver their lines like they&apos;ve been woodenly memorized. Nonetheless, Ames is drop-dead gorgeous in her high-fashion gown circa 1943, while Morison (nurse Stella) has the most fetching over-bite this side of Gene Tierney. All in all, this hour of intrigue is spotty but does show promise for future entries. \n\n(In passing—those Chaney voice-overs conveying his private thoughts are a carry- over from radio where they were necessary to prevent &quot;dead air.&quot;)"

      "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that&apos;s been talked about to death? Just this: If you&apos;ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it&apos;s a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it&apos;s so fun to watch.\n\nJanet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss&apos;s obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk&apos;s possessive mother, who as her boy explains, &quot;is not herself today.&quot; I&apos;ll say she isn&apos;t, and so would Leigh&apos;s Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that &quot;Do-Not-Disturb&quot; sign before taking a shower.\n\nYou can feel the decade literally shifting out of &apos;50s and into &apos;60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what&apos;s going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.\n\nMost especially, there&apos;s Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion&apos;s boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word &quot;falsity&quot; or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.\n\nHe shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam&apos;s boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you&apos;re always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he&apos;s busy covering up &quot;Mother&apos;s&quot; misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.\n\nIf you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote&apos;s. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for &quot;Psycho.&quot; Certainly &quot;Psycho&quot; looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.\n\nIt&apos;s thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.\n\nIs it the best Hitchcock movie? It&apos;s definitely one of his best, right up there with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Strangers On A Train&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot; and &quot;Shadow Of A Doubt.&quot; He only once again came close to making as good a film, with &quot;The Birds,&quot; while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.\n\nOften imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, &quot;Psycho&quot; still isn&apos;t played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",

      "reviewBody": "When Josef Goebbels wanted to make a propaganda film he didn&apos;t do things by halves. All those extras you see in one of those cast of thousands worthy of a DeMille film from Hollywood are soldiers taken from the front and probably grateful for the chance to play 18th century soldiers instead of being 20th century ones. \n\nThe Great King is about Frederick the Great whose reign was probably the height of the Hohenzollern rule in Prussia. We should be exceedingly glad that Old Fritz as his subjects called him didn&apos;t have the resources of the modern German state that was united in 1871. As it was the man was a military genius who as we see in this film managed to snatch triumph out of defeat. For a while there it looked like the upstart state of Prussia was going to be overrun by all of Europe in the Seven Years War. Prussia&apos;s nominal ally was Great Britain, but the British had a lot of far flung adventures in places like India and North America where we were fighting The French And Indian War.\n\nOtto Gebuhr who looked a whole lot like Frederick the Great made several film appearances as him. Kind of like character actor Frank McGlyn who was always being cast as Abraham Lincoln. The film was directed by Hitler&apos;s favorite director Veit Harlan who found a role for his wife Krista Soderburg as the wife of a Prussian soldier who learns too late the value of discipline. That was a message that Hitler wanted to send loud and clear to his audience, have faith in me because I&apos;m the 20th Century version of Old Fritz.\n\nEven the Nazis tell in the film that part of the reason for Prussia&apos;s triumph was some court intrigue in Russia after Empress Elizabeth died. That whole story is told in both the Elizabeth Bergner and Marlene Dietrich films on Catherine the Great. Suffice it to say in the film and in real life Frederick was shrewd enough to exploit matters.\n\nThe Great King is a great film, certainly the equal of any Hollywood production even if it is propaganda for the Third Reich.",

I&apos;m going to have to see it again this weekend just to catch some of the witty one-liners that I couldn&apos;t hear over the roaring laughter. The audience even applauded when it ended.\n\nThe script is razor sharp, and you couldn&apos;t dream up a better cast to bring it to life. I&apos;ve always liked Sam Rockwell, but this was a star-making turn for him (at least in my book). You&apos;ve never seen a movie quite like this. I see a new movie nearly every week, and I rarely feel compelled to sit down and write a review. So take my advice, do yourself a favor and go see it!",

      "reviewBody": "I realize Sam&apos;s Lake isn&apos;t anything quite like Crystal Lake, but still I was secretly hoping that Jason Voorhees would pop out of the water during one of the numerous boring moments and increase the bloodshed and body count a little. No such luck, unfortunately, as &quot;Sam&apos;s Lake&quot; is a fairly pretentious and wannabe clever thriller instead of just an amusing and undemanding slasher. The opening sequences of this film are exactly the same as the opening sequences of approximately 7.500 other horror films, with a group of friends heading out to a remote middle-of-nowhere forest area for a weekend of fun and laughter. The only slight difference here maybe is that the main characters aren&apos;t sex-addicted teenagers but losers in their early thirties with dysfunctional backgrounds. There&apos;s very little going on during the first 45 minutes, except the atmospheric narration of a local urban legend campfire tale about a mentally unbalanced young boy who escaped from the asylum and returned to the area to slaughter his family members. The events further in the film are obviously related to this local legend, but not exactly like you would expect. The group stupidly decides to explore the murder&apos;s ramshackle cabin and find a journal that sheds a disturbing new light on the urban myth. If you manage to struggle through this incredibly dull film (though there are a couple of nice shots of leaves floating on the lake&apos;s surface), there&apos;s an essential plot twist after about an hour of playtime. Admittedly this particular twist is quite original and unpredictable, but it&apos;s probably also the single most implausible thing I&apos;ve ever seen. Also, the twist may give a powerful short energy boost to the film, but the finale is a tedious and confusing mess again. I think I must have stopped paying attention to the story lines, because all of a sudden a Rob Zombie look-alike showed up. What the hell? The murder sequences are tame and most of them occur off-screen, which is the one thing that every horror fanatic hates. &quot;Sam&apos;s Lake&quot; is boring and largely derivative with only a small handful of notable moments. Hardly a movie to recommend.",

The court ruled that details of the alleged crimes are not to be published in the media in any way, shape or form, including the internet. Failure to respect this ban could result in criminal charges against the film producers, and anyone posting details online. No one wants this case to be thrown out due to a technicality. That would be horrible. I wonder too if the producers considered contacting any of the family members to see how they felt about a film being made and released at this time? Or at any time for that matter. I realize the Karla film has been released, but that was AFTER she was released from prison, not before her trial.\n\nJust my 2 cents worth.",

      "reviewBody": "If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned from reading the other reviews around here, it&apos;s definitely that &quot;Funny Man&quot; is the type of film that you either praise into the heavens or hate with a passion; there doesn&apos;t appear to be a middle way. Personally I&apos;m tempted to unite with the hate crew, but that is preeminently because the fan-boys are exaggeratedly enthusiast without using real arguments. They merely just claim that &quot;Funny Man&quot; is awesomely hilarious; period. I even encountered some reviews where people dreadfully stated that the adversaries of this movie simply &quot;don&apos;t get&quot; the type of humor. See, I really hate that What exactly is there to &quot;get&quot;? It&apos;s a cheesy and low-budgeted 90&apos;s horror movie about an ugly jester killing off uninteresting characters whilst firing off lousy and wannabe clever one-liners, so it&apos;s fairly safe to say there&apos;s absolutely nothing specific &quot;to get&quot; here. I&apos;ll be the first to admit that &quot;Funny Man&quot; also contains a handful of ingenious elements and mildly amusing gags. The main problem, however, are the bad ratios. For every brief flash of inventiveness, there&apos;s an intolerably large amount of tedious sequences. For every effective joke, there&apos;s literally a truckload of embarrassingly lame and painfully misplaced farces. After approximately 50 minutes of running time, you&apos;ve pretty much seen and heard about as much as any normal person can take and the last half hour is practically unendurable to sit through. &quot;Funny Man&quot; is probably the most atypical British horror movie I&apos;ve seen. Traditionally speaking, British genre movies implement a distinct and easy recognizable sense of humor, but this one is as vulgar and insipid as any random amateur US trash production. Most likely more than half of the entire budget was spent on convincing the almighty Christopher Lee to make a cameo appearance among an extended cast of untalented nobodies. Lee briefly pops up at the beginning of the film and portrays a sinister guy in a white suit who gambles his ancestral house in a game of poker and loses it to a sleazy drug-addicted record producer. The joke&apos;s on him  literally  because Christopher forgot to mention anything about the psychopathic buffoon living there. The Funny Man quickly disposes of the producer&apos;s family and eagerly awaits the next shipment of brainless victims to waste. They arrive in the form of a van filled with dimwits looking like runaways from a canceled Scooby-Doo episode. Some of the killing scenes are amusing and imaginatively repellent (like the duck hunting and puppet theater), but the majority of them are plain dull and overlong. The Jester may sound like a potentially cool new horror icon, but he&apos;s actually rather uninspired and boring. His appearance seems to be based on Jack Nicholson in &quot;Batman&quot; mixed with a &quot;Killer Klown from Outer Space&quot;, with the stand-up comedian talents of Chucky the Good Guy Doll or maybe even Freddy Kruger in the later installments of &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. He has no bizarre background or occult myth attached to him and even the house he operates in doesn&apos;t have a morbid history. Well, there we have the problem &quot;Funny Man&quot; is a movie without depth. Get that?",

      "reviewBody": "Fallen Angel is directed by Otto Preminger, with cinematography by Joseph LaShelle, who also worked with Preminger on the film Laura the year before. The film stars Alice Faye, Dana Andrews, Linda Darnell &amp; Charles Bickford. Seen as something of a lesser entry in film noir and on Preminger&apos;s CV (he claimed to not even remembering the film when quizzed about it once!), the piece is famous for being the last film Faye made as a major Hollywood actress. Disappointed at how studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck and Preminger cut her role out of the picture (they were all about Darnell), Faye left the studio the day after a preview screening, and did not make another film for 16 years.\n\nThe plot sees Andrews as press agent Eric Stanton, who down on his luck gets turfed off the bus some 150 miles from San Francisco and finds that he is in the small coastal town of Walton. Here he meets sultry waitress Stella (Darnell) and frumpy recluse June (Faye). The former he is very attracted too, so is everybody else it seems, the latter has just come into a lot of inheritance money, something else that catches Eric&apos;s eye. Pretty soon his life will be surrounded by love, infatuation, jealousy and worst of all - murder.\n\nMore a mystery whodunit than an overtly dark venture into the realm of film noir, Fallen Angel is still a tidy and atmospheric movie. One where we can never be fully sure everything is as it at first seems. Especially the three main protagonists, where Preminger, in spite of not remembering doing so, misdirects the audience about the character&apos;s make ups. This greatly aids the whodunit structure where the killer is well disguised until the end reveal. Its also nicely shot by LaShelle, where the lighting is key for scenes involving the more vixen like Darnell and the more homely Faye, the difference, and what it says, is quite striking. It be a nice narrative line to follow on revisits to the film.\n\nThe acting is safe, with Darnell leaving the red blooded men amongst us happy and wanting more. And in spite of some uneven threading of the plot in the last quarter, the end is a triumph and a genuine surprise. 7/10\n\nFootnote: The source novel the movie was adapted from was written by Marty Holland. Also the author of &quot;The File on Thelma Jordan&quot; (1949), Marty was actually a she named Mary, of who little or nothing else is known about because after 1949 she upped and vanished never to be heard of again!",

The Brothers Gore have done a superb job on this.\n\nI have read a few negative reviews on this on IMDb, one said the gore effects were bad...are you blind!\n\nThis is and Independent horror film, and one of the best I have seen. The guys who made this Jesse T Cook and John Geddes, wrote, directed and starred in this...kudos to those guys.

      "reviewBody": "There are a number of comics transferred to film, and that trend carried on even today with the vast number of superheroes revitalized by adventure films backed by CGE effects. In Denmark in the fifties popular family comics such as &apos;Far til Fire&apos; and &apos;Poeten og lillemor&apos; were brought to life. The main character was modeled after the Danish poet Frank Jæger, and once I actually lived in the neighborhood of his village house. After nine years in a daily newspaper, the comic had become an institution, so Erik Balling thought it safe to portray it on film. The poet family couple performed perfectly by Henning Moritzen and Helle Virkner makes us accept details that is rather silly, but together with the ensemble of colorful local characters in the village, where the poet family through a donation can afford to buy a modest house, things work out to our indulgence. Capable director Balling prevents this comedy vehicle from ending up as a mere farce. The film caused two sequels to be issued, but they were not so sparkling as the first installment.",

Close at hand...is a pet cemetery where all the dogs and cats killed on the road are buried. Neighbor Fred Gwynne shows another cemetery with incredible powers just beyond...the power to reanimate the dead. Trouble is the dead are nothing like they once were. Although I have not read the book by Stephen King, he did write the screenplay and must have remained relatively faithful to his own work. The film has many flaws but is also worthwhile. Coincidence and some muddled flashbacks from the past help make the script somewhat erratic and implausible. The acting in the leads is OK, but in the second half really deteriorates. Fred Gwynne is literally and figuratively a cut above the rest. He gives a heartfelt performance as a man run down with time and over-burdened with knowledge he should or would not have. Brad Greenquist is also good in his role as a ghost. His character also causes some believability factors. Director Mary Lambert does do some things rather nicely. There are some well-shot scenes of the cemeteries. The peril of the trucks is made very real, and she also relies heavily on human emotion that is universal. At its heart, Pet Semetary is about loss, coping with loss, and grief, and what are some of the effects of not coping with those things well. The film has many suspenseful moments, and although the ending became a bit tiresome - still manages to keeps its mood and message throughout. Author Stephen King has an interesting cameo as a preacher!"

Her unemployed sister Sharon (Swoosie Kurtz) and her no-good husband Joe (Jamey Sheridan) are staying with her. Kelly reveals that she&apos;s pregnant. Iris and Stanley start hanging out together and she finds out his secret. She lets the cat out of the bag to his boss and he&apos;s fired. He&apos;s left with menial work and forced to leave his father in an old-age home. When his father dies, he can&apos;t even spell the name for the death certificate. He asks her to teach him how to read.\n\nThe story has a lot of tough things going on for these poor people. The problem is that it&apos;s done with little drama. Both Fonda and De Niro are going low key with their performances. The romance is a slow boil. The movie doesn&apos;t hit big points hard or stay with them. The first big move is Joe hitting Sharon. Yet there is little follow up with them. Kelly is pregnant but that&apos;s another side trip. The most compelling part of the movie is the illiteracy but I&apos;m not impressed with them transitioning to a romance. The acting is solid but it&apos;s all done without much tension or drama.",

It had all sort of spices, ghost, a good king, an abnormal king, palaces, evil prime minister, evil magician, etc.It was a new landmark in the Indian film. This is an evergreen film for generations to come. The songs were beautiful. Only one small defect. In the last song when Goopy wanted lots and lots of sweets, they should have clapped.Because, they get food only both of them claps. Here foods came but there were no clapping! But this is very very negligible. And finally we have to admit a new quality of songs.The lyrics, the background music, the comedy within the songs - a completely new type.",

The cheerful side of the Ingrid Bergman/Liv Ullman grim Ingman Bergman &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; I know that Carrie Fisher with her American wit was telling us something, something personal but did it have to be so shallow? There is nothing about this characters with a hint of depth. Drugs and alcohol part of a culture in permanent denial. Maybe that&apos;s what it is. We&apos;re witnessing the replicas of what used to be human beings. The hurt is so flimsy. He may have told a million women that they smelled like Catalina, so what? Didn&apos;t she notice the phoniness in Dennis Quaid&apos;s smirk? I had to rush and see &quot;Plenty&quot; and stare into Meryl Streep&apos;s face to be reminded of her greatness. Not that she&apos;s bad here, not at all, she&apos;s wonderful, it&apos;s the character that made me recoil in horror. Okay, enough of that. the combination of MacLaine and Streep is terrific and the film will keep you entertained even if, like in my case, will leave you with a toxic aftertaste.",

      "reviewBody": "Italian horror films are generally well known for preferring visual style and atmosphere over logical plotting and realistic dialogue, but in the 1970&apos;s these films became increasingly over-the-top stylistically and often downright nonsensical. Of course, they also tended to paper over all the gaping plot holes with copious, and often even ridiculous, amounts of sex and nudity. (But I didn&apos;t mind as much here as the latter was all provided by the very lovely Leonora Fani).\n\nA young university student &quot;Lillian&quot; (Fani) returns to her family&apos;s country villa near a lake where years earlier had mother drowned. She is supposedly researching a local legend, a witch called Kira and strange symbol associated with her. But she seems to spend a lot less time at the library &quot;researching&quot; than she does flat on her back giving it up to all local guys. Whenever she reaches orgasm, however, she falls into a weird death trance and some horrible fate befalls her sex partner (a car accident, a drowning etc.) Naturally, there&apos;s a lot of talk in the town about this strange, slutty girl (but she still never seems to lack for willing sex partners). &quot;Lillian&quot; also seems to have some kind of weird relationship with a local mentally retarded girl name &quot;Lilith&quot;, who is always spying on &quot;Lilian&quot; and masturbating whenever she has sex (which makes for quite a rigorous masturbation schedule). Meanwhile, the witch &quot;Kira&quot; (who looks kind of like the Italian fumetti comic-strip villainess &quot;Baba Yagi&quot;) also seems to be hanging around. And &quot;Lillian&apos;s&quot;own mother, though generally unseen except in the prologue, is referred to by the locals as the &quot;lady in the lake&quot;. And if four weird women isn&apos;t enough, there&apos;s also a little, local blind girl who tears the heads off her dolls and says a lot of cryptic things.\n\nThis is not Enzo Castellari&apos;s best film by a long-shot (and he claims he didn&apos;t actually direct most of it). But any strengths it does have are owing to his visual style. He makes this nonsense as spooky as possible, and despite the numerous sex scenes, he maintains an atmosphere more of Gothic horror than of softcore pornography. With the possible exception of &quot;Pension Paura&quot;, this is probably Leanora Fani&apos;s classiest film. But this might not be saying much for an actress who starred in a movie with the self-explanatory title &quot;Naked Massacre&quot;, in the uber-scummy &quot;Giallo in Venice&quot; (a flick for those who enjoy some very graphic softcore pornography with their bloody dismemberment), in the deranged &quot;Beastialita&quot; (where her love interest is a big dog), and even in some hardcore porn films (although she was not actually a hardcore actress). Fani is actually pretty good here, but Italian-American character actor Vincent Gardenia is completely wasted as a local yokel. This kind of reminded me of the movie version of &quot;Babi Yaga&quot; with Carroll Baker, but it isn&apos;t as good as that one. It&apos;s not terrible though."

The famous lawman Wyatt Earp (Madison) , who finished with Clanton at the OK Corral, is hired by Jennie Lee (Madeleie Lebeau, the French singer who sang &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in the unforgettable and emotional scene &quot; Casablanca &quot;) , the owner of the saloon of Rio Bravo , in order to end the excesses of Zack Williams (Tichy) , one of the most influential men in town , who supported by a band of outlaws led by Pancho Mexican Bogan (Fernando Sancho), intend to take with all the supplies of local mines . Meanwhile , Earp becomes involved with Clementine Hewitt (in his only film, Carolyn Davies) owner of a mine and Zack object of desire .\n\nThere is plenty of action and thrills in the movie , guaranteeing shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . This Spaghetti was filmed in 1964, a notorious year in the development of European western that almost doubled since former year with movies filmed in Spain and involving Spanish producers (thirteen Western were filmed westerns in 1963 and almost thirty in 1964 ); it consolidated this trend the following year with the shooting of more than forty. This rise was due not only to the landing of U.S. producers seeking to reduce costs and to compete with the burgeoning TV series set in the West , but, above all , the change in the policy of subsidies, priority from now at the box office and encouraged co-productions . The film so we can fit within &quot;urban western &quot; prevailing at this time in Western films shot in Spain, whose films were characterized by a very similar plot structure in which the hero, characterized by his skill with firearms, stop in a population temporarily hit by a crime wave affecting, among others, to a girl who will protect and then fall in love with her , while unmask the villain .\n\nMoreover, and as usual in these early productions in Europe, shows a clear influence of the western U.S. and is also seen in the characters . Thus, as would be usual in this type of products, the main character is a historical figure, in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; in 1946 directed by John Ford, the famous &quot; Duel of Titans&quot; (1957) by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in &quot;The Hour of the Gun&quot; (1967) ; the demystifying &quot;Doc&quot; (Frank Perry, 1971) or the more modern &quot;Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; (George P. Cosmatos, 1993) and Wyatt Earp (Lawrence Kasdan, 1994). Also noteworthy in this respect the figure of the drunken sheriff again refers to &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and, specifically, the character played by Dean Martin similarly to Massimo Serato . Finally you can trace the footprint of several American westerns in the approach of the film and in some situations. Regarding the approach to &quot;Wichita&quot; (excellent western filmed by Jacques Tourneur in 1955 in which a young Earp-McCrea put order in the city the title taken by outlaws). But despite its lack of originality and not hide influences , I think the film works reasonably well thanks to the work of the cameraman , musician , enough budget that results in a more than acceptable work setting and filming in numerous locations with highlights about the planning of the various scenes, offering nicely filmed several sequences mainly the action, as a remarkable and realistic showdown . \n\nAs for the cast, as was also usual, at the top, we found an American actor decided to try his luck in European cinema . In this case the character brought to life , legendary Earp , well starred by Guy Madison , actor who had his first major role in &quot;Until the End of Time&quot; a drama directed by Edward Dmytryk, 1946 to then changed in action roles , mainly series B westerns , get some success with the series &quot;Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; and ends up traveling in Europe in the sixties where he made many Euro-westerns . The rest of the cast , we find the two negative characters to which the director gives a different treatment : firstly the Mexican outlaw Pancho Bogan to be described in some respect , as he is a villain but with his own code of honor , the German living in Spain Gerard Tichy giving life to the greedy Zack Williams , a devious individual , devoid of honor , who never shows his face, uses others to do the dirty work and attempts to hide true intentions ; role he repeated in many westerns . But let us look at the film that had a pretty big budget for this type of film and whose production was responsible Italo Zingarelli, producer, director and screenwriter who used to guarantee the quality of his products . The Argentinian , nationalized Spanish writer/filmmaker Tulio Demicheli so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . He directed Gazpacho Western as ¨Tequila¨, ¨Arriba Sabata¨ and ¨Man and a colt ¨ . Demicheli had a long , prolific career , working from the 40s , he directed all kind of genres as drama as ¨Herida Luminosa¨ , Thriller as ¨Ricco¨ , adventures as ¨Son of Captain Blood¨, ¨First adventure¨ , Spy sub-genre as ¨¨Il Nostro Agente a Casablanca¨, ¨Dirty game in Panama¨ , ¨Misión Lisboa¨ , Giallo as ¨Coartada en Disco Rojo or Two faces or fear¨ , Horror as ¨Monstruos De Terror or Assignment Terror&quot; ¨ .",

      "reviewBody": "Simon Hartog&apos;s &quot;Beyond Citizen Kane&quot; is a remarkable and fascinating work that shows the dimension and the influence of Rede Globo in Brazilian&apos;s life (An influence larger than life). The documentary shows footages of the network in its greater moments and showing that behind all that glory and success lies a powerful company with tremendous power over people, including artists, politicians, and many others. Controversies enfolding the creation of the network, allies with the military regime during 20 years, false news and the infamous coverage of the presidential debate in 1989 are shown with the commentaries of several famous people, including ex-directors and reporters who have worked at Globo. \n\nThis documentary was going to be released on theaters here in Brazil but because of Globo&apos;s power it was banned from release after one exhibition to the press, back in 1994. Never was shown in television. The Brazilians could only see this picture when several copies were posted on the internet (Globo doesn&apos;t own the internet as far as I know).\n\nThe title it&apos;s a comparison between Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;) and Roberto Marinho president of Globo Corporation. Which is the same kind of power that both of these men held in their arms. Excellent film!",

      "reviewBody": "The High and the Mighty might be called Muzzy Marcellino&apos;s movie since it was his wonderful, masterful whistling of the theme that made this movie not just good, but great. It is a pity that his talents were not more appreciated, but then most people think that anyone can whistle a sonorous tune. Far from it! Very few people could whistle in orchestral color and range which is what this man did for Dimitri Tiomkin&apos;s wonderful score which well deserved the 1955 Academy Award for &quot;Best Music&quot; and Scoring. Yes, John Wayne did indeed make the film his own and turned in a multi-layered performance, and yes, this is the granddaddy of the &apos;disaster films,&apos; which has never been surpassed in quality, but its distinction is not the primacy, nor the casting, nor even the story by a professional pilot, but the distinctive music - distinctly rendered - which one may not notice at first, but which imbues this non-epic with the caliber of stardom.\n\nI can remember when I was in high school in the &apos;60s some ten years after the movie was released (I have never seen it since) and Mr. Marcellino was a guest at one of our assemblies and demonstrated his amazing versatility at whistling and even performed the letters of the alphabet as an example of how he had mastered his craft. His range was phenomenal as he portrayed the instruments of the orchestra and then performed the entire Rhapsody in Blue as well as popular works all by whistling without accompaniment, but admitted that the theme for TH&amp;TM was his proudest achievement. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has never recognized the contributions of all musical forms to the success of pictures as gauged from their mention in passing at the annual telecast Oscar ceremonies, but if they had, this singular performance would have been guaranteed a Special Oscar. Truly, once it is heard, neither it nor the film can ever be forgotten, but will haunt one for years to come! This classic film is the fitting epitaph for Messrs. Wayne, Tiomkin, and Marcellino. Would that we all could be remembered for such an achievement."

      "name": "Another baby-step towards mediocrity.",
      "reviewBody": "After watching BloodRayne, I am thoroughly convinced Uwe Boll will eventually make a good and entertaining movie (five years from now at the very very least.) As Alone in the Dark was a step up from House of the Dead, BloodRayne is a step up from Alone in the dark. Unfortunately, before he gets there Boll will have to continue to trek through the vast expanse of mediocrity one baby step at a time, and there is far more entertainment from a shamelessly bad movie than a merely mediocre one.\n\nThe opening credits take place over a nice little montage of paintings, then moves to a sunset in the mountains effectively establishing the mood in a surprisingly competent fashion. I found myself entertaining the idea, &quot;You know, maybe  just maybe Boll finally made a good movie.&quot; Then just like Alone in the Dark, the first actor opened his mouth and my hopes collapsed. I shook my head, sighed, then braced myself to endure another 80 minutes of performances downplayed to the point that they lack conviction. Vladimir (Michael Madsen), the seasoned vampire hunter and head of Brimstone, delivers his lines with a tone that implies he&apos;s been around and seen everything. As a free bonus, Madsen adds an additional quality: unenthusiastic boredom.\n\nKagun (Ben Kingsley) the old powerful vampire lord, having achieved demi-God status amongst mortals, spends most of his time sitting, standing, or walking. He takes action only in the ceremonial sense. Played to perfection by Kingsley who goes so far as to make his own appearance in the film seem equally ceremonial and equally inconsequential.\n\n(Although one has to wonder if Kingsley and Madsen both went overboard in their performances, or if the editing pushed the performances over the threshold. Dwell on that for a moment, but don&apos;t answer.) \n\nDomastir (Will Sanderson), Kaguns&apos; henchman, forever has a crazed wide-eyed stare that lacked any sense of menace. It reminded me of that look pro wrestler gives during their pre-match smack talk rants (which I, try as I might, can&apos;t watch with a straight face) ,and from hence forth I saw Domastir as the little wrestler who couldn&apos;t.\n\nAs for Rayne, herself, Kristanna Loken does an admirable job of wanting to go somewhere with the role despite being trapped by a film that&apos;s lost. It knows where it wants to go, but doesn&apos;t know how to get there. She does what she can to explore the bloodlust and turmoil of vampirism (or dhampirism) even though the film she&apos;s starring in cares only enough to explore blood, blood, and more blood (a point hammered home by the final overly-long montage at the end.) \n\nAnd then Billy Zane, Elrich, comes to the rescue. Zane salvages his role by going in the exact opposite direction as the rest of the cast. He opts for an approach reminiscent of his role in Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, and gives two well timed blasts from the defibrillator to counter the rest of the film floating on tharzine.\n\nMore interesting, yet, is the scene with Elrich and Domastir face to face. When Domastir has a sword to Elrich&apos;s heart, staring as intently as ever like a crazed man obsessed with reading a name tag, Elrich pushes the lil&apos; wrestler wanna-be&apos;s sword aside and dismisses the whole encounter like it was part of his Las Vegas illusionist&apos;s show where Domastir is hypnotized. Elrich and everyone in the audiences knows it&apos;s a joke, but Domastir remains clueless.\n\nGallons of gratuitous gore splatters the death sequences in direct answer to the growing number of PG13 films that should shoot for a hard R but sadly whore themselves to younger audiences. It&apos;s a nice thought, but it comes across as gore for the sole sake of gratuity to the point of goofiness. A direct contrast to BloodRayne&apos;s overly grounded (&quot;grounded&quot; as in six-feet under) performances. Yet another indication, that Billy Zane had the right idea.\n\nBudgetary and time constraints show up in the choreography of the fights and battle scenes, and even more so in the editing of said scenes. The fights seem curiously rehearsed like a stage-dance, and the swords (practice weapons aside) have unusually thick edges. Fair game for criticism? Eh, in places, sure. No doubt, though, that Boll bashers will target anything and everything not up to Lord of the Rings standards.\n\nIn my Alone in the Dark review I mainly focused my criticism on Boll&apos;s parasitic dependency on better films for material in his own to the point that Alone in the Dark cannot stand on its own without Equilibrium, Evil Dead, and the Matrix. BloodRayne is like a baby&apos;s first step, reluctantly letting go and making an unstable effort to walk  letting go of the blatant rip offs (&quot;homages&quot; on steroids) and finding its own style.\n\nUwe Boll&apos;s not there yet, but he&apos;s getting there  one step at a time."

      "name": "A parable of modern China",
      "reviewBody": "This is a story about saving face and winning face, and what can happen if you carry things too far. Gong Li stars as Qiu Ju, a peasant woman with child whose husband is kicked in the groin by the local chief. She wants an apology. The chief of course will not apologize since he would then lose face. Both are stubborn and obstinate. Proud and determined, Qiu Ju steers her way through the bureaucracy from the village to the district to the city; but the thing she desires, an apology from the chief, eludes her. He cannot apologize because he has only sired daughters. He has license (he believes in his heart) because he was insulted by her husband who said he raised &quot;only hens.&quot; \n\nThe Chinese locales, from village roads to big city avenues are presented with stunning clarity so that the color and the sense of life is vivid and compelling. Director Zhang Yimou. forces us to see. From the opening shot of the mass of people in the city walking toward us (out of which emerges Qiu Ju) to the feast celebrating the child&apos;s first month of life near the end, we feel the humanity of the great mass of the Chinese people.\n\nIn a sense this is a gentle satire of the bureaucratic state that modern China has become. But Zhang Yimou emphasizes the bounty of China and not its poverty. There is a sense of abundance with the corn drying in the eaves, the sheets of dough being cut into noodles, the fat cows on the roads and the bright red chili drying in the sun. There is snow on the ground and the roads are unpaved, but there is an idyllic feeling of warmth emanating from the people. One gets the idea that fairness and tolerance will prevail.\n\nIn another sense, this is a parable about the price of things and how that differs from what is really of value. So often is price mentioned in the movie that I can tell you that a yuan at the time of the movie was worth about a dollar in its buying power. (Four and a half yuan for a &quot;pound&quot; of chili; five yuan as a fair price for a short cab ride; twenty yuan for a legal letter.) Getting justice in the strict sense is what Qiu Ju demands. Her affable husband would settle for a lot less. He is the wiser of the two. Notice how Qiu Ju is acutely sensitive to price. She bargains well and avoids most of the rip offs of the big city. But what is the value of being a member of the community? This is a lesson she needs to learn, and, as the movie ends, she does.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

      "reviewBody": "This film is billed as the closest most of us will ever come to being in space.  Given the IMAX 3D technology (which works near perfectly 80% of the time) you do come pretty close.\n\nThe cinematography is brilliant and the 40 years experience of the IMAX film production really show - expect most of the filming is done by astronauts, which make it even more amazing.  Filmed on location quite literally &apos;all over the world&apos; (though identifiable parts are the Kennedy Space Center in the US, &apos;Star City&apos; in the CIS and *somewhere* over West Africa), this is about an international film as you are going to get.\n\nThere are many totally unique sequences in this film: the opening one is a very good computer simulation of a space-walk mishap in which an astronaut becomes unattached from the Space Station.  Later on they do this for real to test the emergency back-pack unit.\n\nThe sound is, as one would expect from IMAX, excellent.  The sub-base adds amazing realism to the launch sequences and docking maneuvers - you can really feel the &apos;thumps.&apos;\n\nThe scenery, especially of earth is breath-taking and very well framed. Also, there are some more human moments: such as the watering of onions that spouted in storage, the birthday party (was it?  Or a crew change-over?) and the &apos;other&apos; scene of stowing provisions (I&apos;ll not spoil the humor on this one) that could have probably only been filmed in free-fall by people actually living there.\n\nThis film exposes the contrast between the CIS &amp; USA space programs: in the former, the equipment is chunky, reliable and functions at minus 20 C; in the later neat, tidy and delicate (the Shuttles seem to need a near perfect day to launch by comparison).  Yet the two do indeed work very well together in orbit, as do the truly international crews: USA, Canadian, Russian, Italian and Japanese all work alongside each other on the missions and the filming.  This &apos;one-ness&apos; is stressed by both the editing and voice-overs given by the astronauts.  It is perhaps un-surprising then that the odd environmental point is made about looking after the planet. As a film, this is short: under an hour.  This is probably long enough: you can hold your breath only so many times before passing out.  The minor detractor is Tom Cruise&apos;s narration: at times it is just a little too intense and grates after a while (though this is highly personal: I ignored it and looked at the pictures).\n\nThis film is great publicity for NASA and goes someway to silencing the neigh-sayers of the ISS / space exploration projects.",

Anne is played by Irene Dunn, who had made a whole bunch of films with Cary Grant. Lots of talking right at the beginning, and we hear how Mayor Anne Crandall has always been the straight arrow, putting others&apos; needs before her own. This story has quite a bit in common with &quot;Key to the City&quot; from 1950. Small town mayor goes traveling to the big city, makes unwanted headlines, the troubles begin... although &quot;Key&quot; was MGM, &quot;Together Again&quot; was Columbia Pictures.. AND it came first. Although, honestly, &quot;Key&quot; was much more zany and fun. &quot;Together&quot; is much more sedate, calm, and collected. Boyer and Dunn are both stealing every scene, and we don&apos;t feel the chemistry we see in &quot;Key to the City&quot;. Directed by Charles Vidor, who would also direct &quot;Gilda&quot; a couple years later . &quot;Together Again&quot; is pretty good. If you haven&apos;t seen &quot;Key to the City&quot;, try to see that one too!",

      "reviewBody": "First and foremost, I rated this a 7/10 for creature design alone! They are truly unique and remarkable, even if the movie itself falls short. The acting is sub-par and there is no real character development at all. Some of the characters were so disgustingly horrible that I was begging for them to be taken out by the zombots immediately and all but cheered the moment they were.\n\nIf you want to see some fantastic creature design, give this movie a try. My husband and I paused the movie several times just to take in the whole creature design aspect. It is entertaining enough from start to finish to warrant a viewing. It&apos;s not really thought provoking, but if you are looking for some mindless fun then give this flick a go!",

Set in the picturesque Dutch countryside, the film captures the charm and simplicity of rural life, while presenting another adventure filled with humor and light-hearted moments.\n\nThe movie retains the endearing qualities of the first installment, with engaging performances from the young leads and a strong sense of community spirit. The scenic backdrop adds a pleasant, nostalgic feel to the story, making it visually appealing.\n\nHowever, the sequel suffers from a predictable plot and a lack of fresh ideas. The storyline feels repetitive and doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of new or exciting developments. While the charm of the characters and setting remains, the film struggles to capture the same magic as its predecessor.\n\nOverall, &quot;Kameleon 2&quot; is an enjoyable yet unremarkable continuation of the Kameleon series. It&apos;s a pleasant watch for fans of the first film, but it lacks the innovation and excitement to stand out on its own.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Outskirts (Okraina)&quot; follows several stories as villagers in a far-distant Russian town are faced with war, a strike, a prisoner-of-war camp, and the effects and aftershocks these all bring. The town the film begins in is struggling with the shocks and effects of war, and the film follows those effects in multiple story lines. The ways that the war is used vary, from a factory strike brought on by the harshness of the times, to a young woman and her budding relationship with a German prisoner of war, to the shoe factory strike, to the soldiers at the front lines. As with many other Soviet films, there are many semi-leading and leading characters, and these film is constantly shifting between groups of characters and stories we are following. There are also tertiary characters being effected by the war as well. \n\nThe transition from the more comedic parts to the horrors of war are quick, and often very abrupt. The clumsiness of the story comes from the odd pacing, with too-long bouts of time spent in the various places where the film takes place, making it difficult to transition back to the other story lines easily. The film is clearly struggling to fit the appropriate criteria laid forth by the Soviet Union, to tell the right story with the appropriate characters and the right messages. The stories we follow are compelling in and of themselves but the choppy pacing and the lack of technical finesse detract from the overall quality of this complex, multi-layered war film.",

Now let&apos;s start with the merits, the special effects are very nice and the tenor of the story is good thanks to the atmosphere of festive anxiety that is created with each scene and beyond that there are several exaggerated scenes on purpose to seem slightly ridiculous and this it is a good strong point of the film. Speaking of the negative aspects, however, the ideological volatility of the protagonist is highlighted who changes her mind so often as to be ridiculous and this only serves for the continuation of the plot, making the latter much more a tool than the real protagonist, but this occurs po with all the characters making blatantly stupid choices just to get the plot going. So in conclusion the film drags you into a fantasy world full of Christmas magic but with very stupid people inside.",

She is totally awesome,and totally believeable as she makes her transition from almost sickly sweet to gleefully evil.\n\n Alice Evans does a fantastic job as Cruella&apos;s stern, yet humorous probation officer who is less-than-thrilled about her new client. And Ioan Gruffudd is perfect as the slightly naive dog-lover who is torn between wanting to believe that Cruella has turned a new leaf, and being head-over-heels in love with her probation officer. Tim McInnerny makes a re-apperance as Cruella&apos;s flustered, frightened butler, but this time he gets to have a shining moment as he fights a bad guy, and helps to save the day.\n\n The only person I had a problem with was Gereld Depardieu... don&apos;t get me wrong, he&apos;s a great actor, but honestly, I think this role was beneath him. LePelt is stupid and snibbering, practically in love with Cruella and his jokes (i.e. the tiger head on his pants in one scene) fall hopelessly flat. I think Mr. Depardieu should have demanded some intelligence put in this role... I can look past LePelt because Cruella and the others are so great, and the story line is charming, and the animals are once more, terrific. The addition of the talking Macaw really gave the movie an unexpected comic twist.  I give it six stars."

      "reviewBody": "Terms Of Endearment is a story of what happens when life does not go as planned and how you deal with it. In one way or another we are flawed humans, but most of us can rise to the occasion if the situation calls for it. It gained an Oscar at last for Shirley MacLaine and a second for Jack Nicholson though in the Supporting character category.\n\nThe story stretches out over a 30 year period and it starts with the death of MacLaine&apos;s husband early on and she&apos;s left to raise her daughter on her own. As the daughter who grows up to be Debby Winger the two fight constantly. She really doesn&apos;t approve of her choice of husband Jeff Daniels who is a struggling academic who in the course of the movie has several teaching positions and rises slowly in his profession. Not fast enough for MacLaine. She reminds me of Madge Wallace the mother-in-law of Harry S. Truman who never thought her son-in-law would amount to anything. She died in the White House just before the Trumans left for Independence permanently.\n\nWinger has three children, but she&apos;s beset by doubts about Daniels&apos;s infidelity as he does have nubile coeds all about. Both of them misread signals about each other and MacLaine&apos;s hectoring doesn&apos;t help.\n\nAs for Shirley, her neighbor is a retired astronaut Jack Nicholson who is still looking for space groupies. He&apos;s an unlikely candidate to thaw MacLaine out, but they find out they have more in common than they think. And Nicholson has more character than we first suspect.\n\nTerms Of Endearment is a film that places people who are very much like the people who pay to see this film in real universal situations we can all understand. Not hard to understand how this became such a critical and popular hit.\n\nTerms Of Endearment won for Best Picture in 1983 and Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for James Brooks. It got a flock more nominations as well. It&apos;s an enduring classic and will remain so.\n\nThe finale with MacLaine is sublimely beautiful.",

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with a prostitute by the name of &quot;Saengdao&quot; (Piyathida Woramusik) entering a hotel room where she is then savagely murdered and subsequently decapitated by the man inside. A couple of years later, having left Bangkok and needing a place to stay for the night, a Thai rock band just happens to pick that exact same hotel. Upon entering their room one of the band members sees something strange coming out of the air vent and upon examining it further becomes so scared that he runs down into the hotel lobby to escape from what he saw. This strange action is noticed by one of the other members who also decides to look up into the air vent-and he too becomes exceedingly frightened and without saying a word runs away as well. Sensing something is not quite right, each of the other band members examine the air vent and one by one they each see a ghostly image of a woman coming toward them and in abject fear they all run down into the hotel lobby where they quietly discuss what they thought they saw. Not long after that one of these band members sees another apparition in the hotel lobby and upon running outside is killed by an oncoming car. Shocked by everything they have already witnessed the rest of the band then begins to realize that they have all been targeted by a vengeful spirit and each of them look for salvation from it in their own way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting ghost film which could have been much better if the director (Tiwa Moeithaisong) had managed to tie up a few of the missing threads in the end. Having failed to do so it leaves the viewer with some unanswered questions and severely marginalizes what could have been an excellent horror movie. That being said, given its limitations I honestly cannot rate this movie any higher than I have. Average.",

      "reviewBody": "Effective and original little thriller set on the island of Manhattan about a young woman terrorized in her rent-controlled apartment by unknown forces that want her out.\n\nJuliette Lewis, Jane Ehelin, is at her feisty best as the victim of this horror drama who won&apos;t let herself be driven out of her apartment as the terror below her that at first is just annoying begins to turn deadly. The movie &quot;The 4th Floor&quot; has a lot of false leads as to who the person or persons are that are terrorizing the hell out of Jane. If your very attentive you&apos;ll notice something almost at the beginning of the movie, that is repeated in the films final sequence, why all of this is happening to her. \n\nAfter her Aunt Cecile was killed from a fall down the stairs of her building it was found out in Aunt Cecile&apos;s lease that she put Jaen on it as co-occupant to her apartment. Jane was all set to move in with her boyfriend Greg Harrison, William Hurt, a local TV weatherman in the house that he just bought in the New York city suburb of Westchester County. Jaen instead canceled her plans in order to move into that empty and very affordable apartment in the city. As soon as Jaen moved in things began to happen all originating from the 4th floor, the apartment just underneath her. \n\nThe director and writer of the movie &quot;The 4th Floor&quot; leave a lot of red herrings as well as yellow and orange maggots and white and gray mice to what is behind all this and you almost suspect everyone in the movie that Jaen comes in contact with. The ending is quite a surprise because even when it comes it still may keep you hanging as to what was the reason for tormenting Jaen and driving her almost mad and out of her brownstone apartment. The very last scene in the movie really explains it all. \n\nBesides Juliette Lewis William Hurt is very good in an unusually small but important role so are Shelley Duvall, Martha Stewart, no not the Martha Stewart in the news. There&apos;s also Austin Pendleton, Mr. Collins, as Jaen&apos;s neighbors and a very good performance by Tobin Bell the locksmith and next-door neighbor of Jean who knew a lot more to what was happening in Jane&apos;s building then what he let her on to. \n\nTension-pack and really creepy movie that will make your skin crawl as Jaen is slowly constricted by the four walls around her as the terror, that&apos;s a lot closer to her then she thinks, closes in on her for the movies surprising as well as really weird and shocking conclusion.&quot;The 4th Floor&quot; is a lot better then you would, or I did, expect from many of the negative reviews that it got and is well worth seeing.",

I kept thinking that if David Lynch had directed THE WILD BUNCH you would have STRAIGHT TO HELL. It is chock full of a rogues gallery of unique and unforgettable characters. Basically a group of renegade criminals flee to a little dump town in the middle of nowhere to hide out for a while. The result is chaos and more chaos as they try to escape the hell they&apos;ve found. Don&apos;t expect any traditional Hollywood storyline or plot here. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

      "reviewBody": "THE DESPERATE HOURS \n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1 (VistaVision)\n\nSound format: Mono\n\n(Black and white)\n\nThe patriarch of a middle-class suburban family (Fredric March) is forced to take action when they&apos;re held hostage in their own home by three escaped convicts, one of whom (Humphrey Bogart) is an experienced lifer with nothing to lose...\n\nThe first and only pairing of superstars Bogart and March is a tightly-wound thriller, written by Joseph Hayes (based on his novel and stageplay, inspired by actual events), and directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler, distancing himself from the &apos;women&apos;s pictures&apos; he had helped to popularize during the 1940&apos;s (THE LITTLE FOXES, MRS. MINIVER, THE HEIRESS etc.). Photographed in gleaming deep-focus VistaVision by Lee Garmes (SCARFACE, THE PARADINE CASE), the movie wrings incredible tension from the claustrophobic settings and frequent stand-offs between staunch family man March and embittered con Bogart. The movie&apos;s themes are fairly conservative and the outcome is never really in doubt, but this is a top-drawer thriller from Hollywood&apos;s &apos;golden age&apos;. Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin and Gig Young in crucial supporting roles. Unmissable.\n\nNB. Though nowhere near as dreadful as most critics would have you believe, Michael Cimino&apos;s remake DESPERATE HOURS (1990) isn&apos;t a patch on the original.",

      "reviewBody": "Lackluster entry in the prolific peplum genre  these films may have been designed as mere entertainment fodder but very few examples proved otherwise rewarding. This is an even lesser achievement than THE MEDUSA AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES (1963), from the same director and which I watched concurrently; however, it&apos;s basically on the same below-par level of two other such efforts I viewed in the past featuring the same muscle-bound lead, Dan Vadis, namely THE REBEL GLADIATORS (1963) and SPARTACUS AND THE TEN GLADIATORS (1963).\n\nAnyway, the film sees Hercules fighting a tyrant (Pierre Cressoy from FRINE, CORTIGIANA D&apos;ORIENTE [1953]) and saving/loving a damsel-in-distress (&quot;Euro Cult&quot; regular Marilu&apos; Tolo)  nothing new plot-wise, thenexcept that Cressoy is in cahoots with a witch (glamorous Moira Orfei) so that he&apos;s able to unleash an army of gold-tinted musclemen to cause havoc, but they&apos;re clearly no match for Hercules. Even so, the hero&apos;s strength is sapped by an angry Zeus (via a comical jagged thunderbolt insert) at one point  eventually being restored just in time to prevent Tolo from being fatally spiked! During the climax, then, Orfei plays an optical trick on Vadis but which ends up rebounding on herself  taking up Tolo&apos;s semblance as she&apos;s hanging from a cliff, but Hercules recognizes the true heroine from the color of her eyes and Orfei perishes in the sea instead!\n\nFor what it&apos;s worth, the film includes plenty of action sequences  but, more often than not, they&apos;re rendered hilarious by way of obvious repeated footage, exaggerated death reactions and clumsy stunt-work.",

Hector Babenco&apos;s ultra-downer &quot;Ironweed&quot; does that. Jack Nicholson plays drifter Francis Phelan, who returns to his home town (where he hasn&apos;t been in years) and traipses around it, seeing the poverty prevalent throughout the Depression. He deals with his own demons and sees whether or not he can start up a new life. But he can&apos;t escape the reality of the status quo, or of his own past.\n\nWatching this movie, you may feel like you&apos;ve just been drug through a gutter. But one must wonder how much better things are nowadays. For how terrible the Depression was, it helped our country understand not only abject poverty, but what caused the Depression. In this era of air-heads slacking off and using as many resources as possible, I wonder whether or not we might be headed towards a new kind of Depression. If so, then the movie warned us.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this movie, but understand that it&apos;s a total downer. Also starring Meryl Streep, Carroll Baker, Michael O&apos;Keefe, Diane Venora, Fred Gwynne, Tom Waits and Nathan Lane.",

      "reviewBody": "With those stunning camera shots of Chicago and that snappy Harry Connick, Jr. song in the title sequence, &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; gets off to a great start. And I liked Bonnie Hunt as the story&apos;s narrator. But the film suffers from a plot that is too predictable and from characters whose behavior is not believable.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can see the end coming a mile away. There are virtually no plot twists to deflect the story&apos;s straight-line trajectory. As such, the story is almost too simple and unimaginative to be worth telling. To varying degrees, most romantic comedies are fairly shallow. But &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; has no subtlety at all, not in plot, not in characters, not in dialogue.\n\nLacking any complexity, the story relies on two main characters, Jay (Jason Lee) and Max (David Schwimmer) whose behavior toward each other is not believable. They&apos;re supposed to be best buddies. But they are constantly at each other&apos;s throats. Their constant arguing not only is annoying; it calls into question their friendship. How can they be best buddies?\n\nThe two are not at all alike. Jay is bookish and cerebral; Max is your typical arrogant, cocky self-centered sports freak jerk. All that animosity between these two guys does not lend credibility to their &quot;friendship&quot;; yet, it is the main contrivance that propels the film&apos;s plot. Further, it renders a story conclusion that is, by extension, also not believable.\n\nThe film&apos;s acting is a tad exaggerated. I like Jason Lee, but he tends to overact in this film. Mili Avital, as the girl in between, is okay, but she doesn&apos;t have much to do. And David Schwimmer&apos;s performance is something of a hyper-masculine strut-fest. Some subtlety in acting would have helped a lot.\n\nFor all that, &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; is still worth watching, once. It has credible production values, and there are occasional lines of dialogue that are funny. And I think the film&apos;s underlying concept is fine. I just wish the script and the acting could have been a little more nuanced and subtle."

Hands up all those people with any interest at all in bobsledding. Hah!  I knew it!  No-one.\n\nThat&apos;s why `Cool Runnings&apos; succeeds.  It depends not at all on aggressive nationalism (it couldn&apos;t afford to, with a constituency of 2.6 million), and people of all countries are free to participate in the Jamaicans&apos; perfectly reasonable patriotism.  (Probably even the Swiss, whose bobsled team comes across as more than a trifle arrogant.)  Nor is there any of that worship of a particular sport that makes baseball movies so unendurable for people outside of North America, Cuba and Japan.  (Not that I have any evidence that baseball movies are popular in Cuba or Japan.)\n\nThere isn&apos;t any power-of-positive-thinking psychobabble, either - at least, it doesn&apos;t dominate.  The four Jamaican bobsledders are separate people with different goals and ways of thinking.  The coach (played beautifully by John Candy, who proves that he can act without playing the clown) doesn&apos;t ram a particular ideology down his players&apos; throats.  I doubt that any sports film has a more civilised and reasonable coach.\n\nIt comes down to this: we are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that&apos;s worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichés are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It&apos;s a sweet film, and I doubt there&apos;s more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, children up to 11 years, especially girls, will love this movie.\n\nIt is very child-oriented, which means it is a bit infantile, especially in delivering its message. The message is, and here comes Al Gore in, who will love this movie also, that we humans are bad bad bad when it goes to matters of nature, animals, earth.\n\nParents will probably get bored sometimes, because the message is delivered with some long lasting sermons, which we hear all over the time, but in this case from the oldest and wisest animals on earth. And children learn that what their parents do for their living, is mostly bad and causes nature to suffer. But to be honest, that&apos;s true. Nature is raped by man, and we don&apos;t care. After there seems no other way in Germany to raise the funds for a Pixar-like animated movie, we have to live with it. Not too bad for us to be confronted with a bitter truth once more, although it&apos;s not brought to us very subtle.\n\nAnimation is good and doesn&apos;t stay behind current productions. 3d effects are also impressive and obviously not post-production.\n\nThe characters are nice and funny and believable, mostly cliché of course, the plot is executed adventurous enough to keep everybody in line, even if we know, how the movie will end.\n\nWhat the movie lacks is independence, its a mixture of everything from Madagascar through Ice Age and Horton, a perfect example of target group oriented product placement. &apos;No experiments&apos; was the prime directive during production, it&apos;s obviously. Personally, I thought they took that too serious.\n\nBut nevertheless we go into a theater to watch a movie that makes our kids happy. If this is what our children makes happy, so what shells ? I don&apos;t open my wallet (so wide) to have a censorious conversation afterward, but to ask &apos;How did you like it ?&apos; and get the answer &apos;I loved it so much&apos;. And I got it."

      "reviewBody": "This especial Western with allegoric qualities deals with a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins who wore a hairpiece) bent on vengeance , she forms a group (Will Hutchins and Warren Oates who in his biography he said that he had a crush on co-star Millie) to escort her across a warming desert . Later on , the posse is joined to a cocky gunfighter (Jack Nicholson) until a surprising finale.\n\nOutlandish and difficult western is packed with thrills , exciting pursuits , noisy gun-play and strong performances . Written , produced (along with an uncredited Roger Corman) and starred by Jack Nicholson . Most budget was spent on the salaries for the horse wranglers , who along with the cast were the only union element in the picture . The slight budget was wasted on near constant rains ; in fact , very little was accomplished in the first two days of filming because of the severe flooding in the areas that were chosen as key locations . It is well set against the hot barren background and splendidly photographed landscapes by Gregory Sandor . Cinematographer Sandor shot the bulk of this film using natural light . Made back to back with ¨Ride the whirlwind¨ (where some cowboys are mistaken for members of a band) , both of them bear similar cast , cameraman , director and technicians.\n\nThis offbeat and strange motion picture filmed in 1965 was well directed by the maverick Monte Hellman , being firstly shown at the Montreal Film Festival in Canada . His movies are full of similarly independent-minded stars as Jack Nicholson and Warren Oates (his habitual actor) and result to be appreciated by the critics but virtually suffer lukewarm reception by the public . His firsts films were produced by Roger Corman , two horror quickies in low budget , titled ¨The beast from haunted cave (1959)¨ and ¨Back door to hell (64)¨ . After that , he directed two intelligent Western filmed concurrently in 1967 , and ¨Two-lane blacktop (71)¨, describing the underbelly of American life , furthermore ¨Cockfighter (74)¨, a not easily approachable film and sometimes nor even easy understandable . Later on , Hellman has not got his balance right , film-making flops as the Western ¨China 9, Liberty 37 (1979)¨, adventures ¨Iguana (88) and commercial terror as ¨Silent night, deadly night 3 (1989)¨. Nowadays, Hellman only makes failed B movies and television series .",

      "reviewBody": "This is the second X-FILES movie, made a decade after the first and a good six years after the series finally ended on television. In many respects, it feels like nothing more than extended episode; gone is the government conspiracy stuff, to be replaced with a stand-alone storyline involving psychics and FRANKENSTEIN-style experiments that recalls the good old days of the early seasons. Many fans were disappointed that the underlying alien stuff was dismissed for this film, but I didn&apos;t mind it at all. If they made films like this every couple of years, I&apos;d be happy.\n\nAs a piece of entertainment, it isn&apos;t entirely satisfying, although I found it watchable enough. The plot is meandering in places – especially during the mid section – and the low budget readily apparent in some cheesy effects scenes (such as where we see someone falling). However, the relationship between Mulder and Scully is spot on, and the script allows for plenty of soul-searching between the two leads. Duchovny effortlessly slides back into his character, although Anderson fails to convince in some of her dialogue sequences (although her emotional stuff with a child patient is spot on).\n\nKudos, too, for eliciting a good performance from Billy Connolly, who bags a fantastic role as a priest-turned-paedophile-turned-psychic. I never thought I&apos;d see somebody like Connolly give a quiet, mannered, understated turn, but he does that here. Amanda Peet is fine as another investigator, and even Xzibit convinces as a &apos;real&apos; actor. It&apos;s great to see Mitch Pileggi make a cameo, too.\n\nIt&apos;s not an amazing film, and much of it is familiar stuff done numerous times in more successful episodes, but I enjoyed THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE on nostalgic terms alone. It recalls the glory days of when the show was unmissable entertainment, the best thing on the box, and that&apos;s some achievement",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at &quot;the mile&quot; after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.\n\nA character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.\n\nIt is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie&apos;s considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.\n\nAll in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; director Jonathan Lynn returns to skewer the legal profession (and the acting profession, as well) in this tale of rising legal star Charles Tuttle (Jeff Daniels), a newly minted partner in a prestigious firm. Engaged to marry the boss&apos; daughter (Alexandra Wentworth), he agrees to an impromptu bachelor party thrown by his actor friend Richard Rietti (Michael Richards). This results in him being badly incapacitated, and Richard actually fills in for him when a fraud case goes to trial; since the local court now believes that Richard is the attorney for the defence, he&apos;s obliged to continue with this ruse, leading to some amusing complications.\n\nIt&apos;s all about the appeal and comic abilities of this cast. Ultimately, the film is nothing special, with no real comedy fireworks, but it&apos;s still funny and engaging enough to make it pleasant throughout. It&apos;s too bad Richards, a.k.a. Cosmo Kramer, didn&apos;t get more feature film opportunities in this vein, as he&apos;s really able to strut his stuff. And he has fine chemistry with Daniels, who gets to alternate between being a &quot;straight man&quot;, of sorts, and getting hilariously flustered as things go completely awry. Charlize Theron may be the MAIN reason to watch &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, however, as she *is* utterly adorable as the cute &amp; perky waitress to whom Charles becomes attracted.\n\nThey all receive very capable support from Rip Torn as the con man, Austin Pendleton (who was the stuttering temporary replacement for Vinny in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;) as the judge, a strikingly sexy Jessica Steen as the exasperated prosecutor, Lawrence Pressman as Charles&apos; boss, Max Casella as a VERY young looking doctor, Dale Dye as a psychiatric expert, and Jennifer Coolidge as a priceless &quot;dietary expert&quot; of some kind.\n\nThis would make an agreeable double feature with another 1997 comedy about a lawyer, &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, although &quot;Trial and Error&quot; never does get as cartoonish as that Jim Carrey vehicle.\n\nAmong the highlights: Charles having to sit in a car parked outside the courthouse (he ends up getting banned from the courtroom), beeping in Morse code the sort of dialogue that he needs Richard to deliver.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Original and creative, sadly that is all that it has going for it.\n\nThe acting was nothing short of atrocious, I can see what the director was trying to do, maybe they should have sacrificed some of the plot to build character, better yet, hire some better actors. They were amateurs, there was no &quot;oomph&quot; behind the performance, no emotion.\n\nThe sound editors, fire them. Do they even understand what balance is? The film crew? Do not do with a camera what you cannot do with your eyes, it breaks focus. You have a long way to go, use the dolly. It&apos;s there for a reason.\n\nI hope someone does remake this, doing it properly. It&apos;ll be much more watchable."

This is one of the most stylish and enjoyable and, if they could have come up with a more satisfying finish, it would have been in there with the best. An English dubbed version re-cutting it so that all ends happily didn&apos;t help.\n\nVon Stroheim&apos;s cropped headed, white uniformed, officer type is the hero for once, battling Hayakawa&apos;s sinister oriental casino magnate. The opening where the Von rescues itinerant entertainer Balin from a Chinese firing squad and finds a her glamorous evening dress, that&apos;s just her size, in his yacht&apos;s sail locker is to be treasured.\n\nDirector Delannoy went on to do the Michele Morgan &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; and was one of the pillars of French film for decades and that haunting score is by Auric who did the films of Jean Cocteau. These are heavy weights, who aren&apos;t normally associated with stories about European adventuresses offering their beautiful white bodies to lecherous Asians to save their gun runner lovers - nothing P.C. here. The colorful support and jokey gambling hell detail, along with some marvelous images (the body floating among the bank notes.) combine to shows that they could make escapist hooey with the best.\n\nThe film craft is beyond reproach.",

      "reviewBody": "Only a few Japanese films come to mind that are as grandiose in scope as Kumai Kei&apos;s &quot;Kurobe no taiyo&quot; (The Sands of Kurobe, 1968). The spectacular film, that clocks in 3 hours and 16 minutes, was made to honor the generation that rebuilt Japan in the 1950&apos;s after the devastating experience of war. We are talking about building in the literal sense, as the film deals with the construction of a large tunnel under the Japanese alps. This tunnel is very difficult to build, as the area is located on a seismic zone where earthquakes can be caused by the smallest of mistakes by the building crew. Yet it&apos;s necessary, because the Japanese need to build a huge dam on the other side, and the tunnel is the only way to get the material to the construction site.\n\nSome will naturally see this as a film that drags on, especially in the middle, which largely takes place in the dark tunnel. But for myself Kumai&apos;s diligent determination to depict every detail of the operation was something to admire and gaze in awe. You as the viewer can come in knowing nothing about how tunnels are built under mountains, and afterwards you know so much, that you can go make one yourself. There is narration, maps, time jumps and a large amount of characters, all because this film wants to be a half documentary, even while it sports the look of a large scale disaster movie.\n\nMifune Toshiro plays the engineer who is responsible for one of the sites, and Ishihara Yujiro is there too. As a side plot, Mifune&apos;s daughter is dying of leukemia. Ishihara has a troubled relationship with his own father, who is going insane, but used to be known as &quot;the best tunnel digger in Japan&quot;. All over the film there are big emotions, since this film just refuses to tone things down. The characters are alright, though for me their operation was far more interesting.\n\n&quot;Kurobe no taiyo&quot;, which ended up being the Japanese submission for the Oscar race that year, is a film that demands your concentration, but also rewards it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the film has some fantastic aerial photography of the mountain range. You can practically breath the fresh mountain air while viewing this beautiful scenery. The tunnel on the other hand feels crowded and uncomfortable, as it is supposed to. The score for the film is also grand, and even catchy.\n\nI would recommend this to people who enjoy epic 1960&apos;s films, maybe David Lean fans for instance. This is an uplifting narrative that will really hook some people in, like it did me.",

      "reviewBody": "I was impressed with this marvelous doco after watching it yesterday and unlike Dick Cavett I remember watching the film in the heady days of the 70s in San Francisco-perhaps not as brave and revolutionary as watching it in Oklahoma City but a political statement none the less.\n\nMy thoughts about the film are coloured by this historical connection but that in no way diminishes the strengths of the film. After all these years to see the players in the flesh talking about such a phenomenon made for an enjoyable morning of film watching. You cannot view the film without seething anger at the religious conservatives that made virtually all the player&apos;s lives far more difficult than those lives should have been.\n\nIf there was a villain in the movie it would have been the Tennesee prosecutor who doubled as a lay preacher when he wasn&apos;t trying to make America into his own little brand of religious conservatism. Their kind of dead-head sociology and politics is still rampant in the States and the only difference is they&apos;ve changed their target from sex to terrorism-or at least their definition of political terrorism.\n\nThe directors, Bailey and Barbato, have crafted a superb film inter-cutting old film clips with current interviews in order to create an excellent vision of all the threads between the personalities and opinions of the players. The hilarity of these characters come through when they speak with a forthrightness that generally ends up on the cutting room floor.\n\nIf you are an old guy like me-see the film for its historical look at a time that we can remember. If you are a young person interested in politics, look at the film to see the nature of the bad guys around us now but with new crusades to fight.",

And make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all-time-250! Let me tell you that I&apos;m in no way associated with the creators of this film if that&apos;s what you come to believe reading this. No, but this actually is IT! Nevermind the &quot;kid&apos;s-film&quot; label on it, &quot;Klatretösen&quot; (&quot;Climber Girl&quot;) is on almost every account a classic (as in &quot;biblical&quot;)! The story concerns 12-year old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her daddy&apos;s terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course, nobody could afford that. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! Sounds corny? Don&apos;t forget: This is not America and &quot;Klatretösen&quot; is by no means the tear-jerking Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! Let me put it this way: This film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. And there&apos;s a whole lot more to it than just the &quot;action&quot;. After about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well, granted) it accelerates into a monster that:\n\n\n* effortlessly puts &quot;mission impossible&quot; to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that, mummy!)\n\n\n\n* dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they&apos;re-only-kids-antics here )\n\n\n\n* easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives\n\n\n\n* nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds\n\n\n\n* comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that I can hear the American ratings board wet their pants from over here\n\n\n\n* manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am I saying?? they&apos;re kids! they&apos;re kids! - nevermind, watch that last scene!)\n\n\n\n* stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who since last years &quot;Mirakel&quot; is everybody&apos;s favourite kid actor\n\n\n What a ride!",

Remember it must have been in the early 1960s, when Mao was hatching the Cultural Revolution, and it was dubbed into Mandarin by the Shanghai Film Studio. I can clearly remember that I saw the film in Shenyang with the Chinese title Tiancai (Genius), in Northeast China, and one of the Chinese actresses doing the dubbing was my ex-girlfriend, Zhu Xijuan who had then already gained prominence through her leading role in the Red Detachment of Women Hongse Jiangzi Jun (that was why I broke up with her.) \n\nCould not find the film in any of my searches on Chinese sites (CORRECTION: since initial posting, I did find some information of this film on a couple of mainland Chinese sites using the German title &apos;Wir Wunderkinder&apos;, but with no mention that this film had already been dubbed into Chinese several decades ago, neither could the film be found by using the Chinese title in searching.) and I don&apos;t feel surprised at all. What struck me most at the time of viewing was the similarity of social atmosphere during the rise of the Third Reich with that of China just before the Cultural Revolution. There is no DVD/VCD production of this film now in China (although pirated versions of Western films are very common) and I think Chinese censorship may be part of the cause. After all, the Chinese translation and dubbing then were all very effective, it stirred my awareness then, what would happen if Chinese audiences got infected with such liberal ideas now?\n\nReally hope a DVD version of this film can be made so I can ask my daughter (she&apos;s abroad) might get a copy for me when I&apos;m still able to watch it.",

The plot will take shape quickly,and after this story of sound and fury,the last pictures brings the audience some relief.Note,in both films,&quot;le boucher&quot; and &quot;Que la bête..&quot; ,the presence of water in these last pictures.",

      "reviewBody": "The new film from Sebastian J. F., The War on Drugs, finds him purposefully unwrapping another flagrant nexus of power, politics and big money. This time, it&apos;s the U.S. government&apos;s vaunted battle to control recreational drugs; a campaign that increasingly appears more significant for the government to maintain than to prosecute fully and conclude. The film questions agents of both the government and the underground cartels, and includes lucid analysis of how the self-supporting legal and penal systems in the U.S. complement one another. Then, in a series of interviews with individuals who&apos;ve fallen prey to long-debunked government principles such as mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses, The War on Drugs hits devastating emotional pay dirt with a young mother sentenced to life, innocent but caught in the crosshairs of a TV star&apos;s publicity stunt.\n\nFollowing his exposé of Internet misregulation, info wars, Sebastian J. F.&apos;s new film takes a sobering look at a U.S. obsession gone wrong. By looking at both the local and the systemic pictures, The War on Drugs indicates that a struggle has been established that wins by losing, and that is creating a new &quot;criminal&quot; class to populate the nation&apos;s gargantuan (and increasingly privatized) prison labor system. In the hopes that information is itself a source of power, Sebastian J. F. has tapped into an unnerving and vital story.",

      "reviewBody": "aw this film at it&apos;s press screening this morning at Edinburgh International Film Festival. I&apos;d heard it was meant to be the next &apos;Un Prophete&apos;. Certainly if you haven&apos;t seen &apos;Un Prophete&apos; you may well think this film is brilliant. Those that have seen &apos;Un Prophete&apos; however may go away a little bit disappointed. There is just too much that is the same in both films. Both the films explore the tough inner workings of a prison from the point of view of a new comer. We are not told why this main character is in prison, only that he maybe stabbed somebody. He seems to be a good guy who is trapped working for a gang in prison. He&apos;s made to do tasks he doesn&apos;t want to do so he isn&apos;t treated like dirt, or killed. there is also another gang in the prison made up of Albanians etcetc.etc.\n\nIt&apos;s the same old prison story that&apos;s getting told over and over. It is however a solid story so it&apos;s what they do with it that matters.\n\nThey succeed in creating a likable main character that we sympathise with and support. They show how gritty and corrupt a Danish prison is. They do the whole thing with sexy camera angle&apos;s and expert editing.\n\nI was enjoying the movie, until I began to feel it wasn&apos;t going anywhere, then near the end we switch character perspective and follow a different character for the last fifteen minutes. For me, the story ends with our main character, I&apos;m not interested in seeing his friend story for another 15minutes, that just didn&apos;t work for me. I saw others shifting uncomfortably in the audience as well. When the second end does come though it does hit with impact. I found myself wanting to look away as it was fairly intense.\n\nThe film is on some levels very good, the soundtrack is perfect, well there&apos;s no songs just an intense score. The acting is amazing, the set is great, editing brilliant, script, pretty flawless. It&apos;s the story that just didn&apos;t grab me like it should&apos;ve. There was nothing I hadn&apos;t seen before. It was a classic prison movie, done better than most, but not as good as &apos;Un Prophete&apos; and &apos;Shawshank&apos;. I was blown away by some shots in the film which were just incredible.\n\n&apos;Un Prophete&apos; for me is the best prison movie, it has everything, it is long, but justifiably. R is shorter at 90 minutes, but it was the end that spoiled it for me. If R had come out before &apos;Un Prophete&apos; I&apos;d probably like it better, but R doesn&apos;t explore much that &apos;Un Prophete&apos; doesn&apos;t. I just wasn&apos;t interested in the last 15/20minutes. It&apos;s a shame, a lot of work has obviously gone into the film. It is still worth seeing. However I&apos;d recommend most people just stick with &apos;Un Prophete&apos;.\n\nwww.duncansreviews.wordpress.com \n\nwww.duncancowles.com",

      "reviewBody": "A paranoid, secretive surveillance expert called Harry Caul (reportedly Gene Hackman&apos;s favorite movie in which he has acted) will go anywhere to bug a private conversation , as he is becoming increasingly uneasy about his current job . He is a solitary man in both his personal and professional life, only helped by his assistant Stan (early deceased John Cazale of Deer Hunter) , as they are watching a young couple (Cindy Williams , Frederic Forrest , Coppola&apos;s fetish actor) when Harry begins to suspect that they are murder targets . The professional eavesdropper haunted by the time his bugging cost the lives of some people and terrified that it is happening again , as he has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered . As Harry refines and re-refines the recording, he interprets what he hears in different ways . As Harry discovers shattering revelation believes that the lives of the young couple are in jeopardy .\n\nThis interesting flick turns out to be a powerful statement about privacy , guilty and responsibility ; being ¨surveillance¨ as the basis and theme of the film . The picture contains thrills , emotion , thought-provoking issues and plot twists during the last reel . Very good acting by Gene Hackman as a freelance surveillance expert as well as an intensely private and solitary mature man . His mood of isolation and loneliness is pretty well established . The ¨Tapper¨ Gene Hackman learned to play the saxophone especially for the film . Gene Hackman later plays a former NSA agent who is a surveillance expert in ¨Enemy of the state¨ (1998) by Tony Scott , and the images of his character in his younger days are taken directly from this film . Secondary cast is frankly good , such as John Cazale as his business associate , Allen Garfield as Bernie Moran , Frederic Forrest as Mark , Cindy Williams as Ann and special appearance by Robert Duvall as the Director . In addition , a pre-stardom Harrison Ford , Billy Dee Williams and Teri Garr appear in minor characters . \n\nDavid Shire&apos;s original music was composed prior to production and played for the actors prior to their scenes to get them into the proper moods. Evocative and appropriate cinematography by Bill Butler and Haskell Wexler as uncredited director of photography . This well-made motion picture was stunningly directed by Francis Ford Coppola . In fact , this is Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s personal favorite of his movies. Coppola had written the outline in 1966 but couldn&apos;t get financing until The Godfather (1972) became a success. ¨The Conversation¨ resulted to be one of the best films of the 70s . Rating : Better than average , don&apos;t blink during throughout the film . Essential and indispensable seeing for thriller lovers and Gene Hackman fans .",

      "reviewBody": "If this 2000 film, produced by Lars v. Trier is porn, then a good portion of your &quot;mainstream&quot; films need to be reclassified. I only found this film in your base, after a thorough search. For the first time while voting for many a sex themed and gay themed film, I had to opt for &quot;more titles&quot; for &quot;those wishing to see them.&quot; This revealed a porn section I did not even know existed, and is very interesting, definitely confirming your site once again as the best in its class.\n\nHowever, firstly, this title is as &quot;porn&quot; as many movies seen in any alternative film festival in the past 7 or 8 years. Secondly, what&apos;s with the voting? When I first opened this title a week ago, to see your site&apos;s &quot;view&quot;, to compare with the very positive view in the local conservative newspapers (which nevertheless revere anything with the v. Trier name), and the glossy attractive entry in the Mix Brazil catalog, I was shocked to see that all 18 votes were 1!\n\nNow, how can this happen? I thought this site had some filtering system to avoid one or two people having 18 or 20 votes certified votes calculated. That two (even one) user can have 20 accounts, I don&apos;t doubt that. But I thought there was a control (by computer address or cookies) for this type of abuse. \n\nAlso, what sicko would vote a &quot;1&quot; 18 times for a so-called porno flick, and then not even submit a comment using one of his aliases? Has he no desire to justify it since he&apos;s spent his time voting 18 times for the same film. Well, if this is the case, this guy is sick anyhow. Go figure how his mind works.\n\nThe other (remote) hypothesis is that maybe there were 18 very dissatisfied users since this film is not a porn flick at all, again it is not even in the top 5 or 6 most graphic sex scenes in recent &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;straight&quot; festivals I&apos;ve attended. And, it is GAY, possibly causing a backlash by straight porn addicts.\n\nAnyway, DON&apos;T be misled. I will not give this film a slanted review; I&apos;ll just state facts. This, though they may not be read after the initial 18 or 20 &quot;one&quot; ratings cause a potential viewer to rapidly close the page, especially after having to pass the &quot;porn hurdle&quot; and ask the site to upgrade your preferences to those of a &quot;porn&quot; viewer.\n\nThe film is a video, but shown theatrically at many festivals. Here alone, close to a dozen times, at a total of 3 large cities. It consists of 6 scenes, depicting 6 worlds, 6 desires. Lars v. Trier&apos;s prestigious production company presents a new world of male gods, or men as gods. These new male gods seek to redefine the ancient &quot;sex gods&quot; found in Greek mythology, Roman orgies, more recent bondage and domination legends, and so on. \n\nSEE FOR YOURSELF WHAT YOU THINK OF IT! You&apos;re unlikely to find this title in a PORN SHOP, though you ARE likely to see it at a film festival with rigorous selection processes, as I happened to find it.",

These last fifteen years have seen a series of films flourishing out of the path of some very talented Persian directors, expressing their views on life, on people, on the political issues and so on, through an anthology of subjects that come to show with finesse things that couldn&apos;t be said otherwise. &quot;Marmoolak&quot; is one of those. Only here, the destiny of men and women of an entire country subject to the whims of its rulers symbolized here by one man (the fake cleric played with gusto and talent by Parviz Parastui) is shown not by the means of drama, but throughout comedy. And comedy is something that Persians seem to know about. To say that this film is funny is a euphemism. There is situation comedy here, and it is treated with much lightness. But if one goes farther and looks through it, one can easily capture the fate of an entire people. Works like this, in the form of a film or a book, etc, usually help change things. Let&apos;s hope this one does. Talent as they say, has no boundary.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Swann in Love&apos; did have plenty of things going for it. Really like Marcel Proust&apos;s writing, and &apos;Un Amour de Swann&apos; of the massive &apos;Remembrance of Things Past&apos; is a masterpiece. Sven Nykvist was, and is still near-universally considered as, one of the all-time greats when it came to cinematography, particularly notable in the films of Ingmar Bergman. Love period dramas and always have. And am a fan of Jeremy Irons, and have liked to loved most of his work even in projects that are beneath him.\n\nAfter finding and watching it, &apos;Swann in Love&apos; as has been said already is a brave endeavour in adapting source material that is very difficult to do so, close to unadaptable actually. Proust in general has a sophisticated and subtle style of writing too that is not easy to translate to film or any visual media. &apos;Swann in Love&apos; doesn&apos;t completely succeed and is not the masterpiece level that the book is (that was inevitable though), but there are a lot of good things here, really do applaud it for its noble effort and can really see that a lot of work was put into it.\n\nWill start with what &apos;Swann in Love&apos; does well. It is a thing of beauty visually. The costumes and settings are as sumptuous as one can get, never looking too fussy, and a lot of homework was clearly done in making the recreation of the period as evocative as possible. Nykvist&apos;s cinematography is a wonder, then again with such an amazing and influential cinematographer like Nykvist one doesn&apos;t expect any less. To me, the music fitted very well, especially with Swann&apos;s travels that are far from settled, and was used in a way that wasn&apos;t constant or over-powering. It is also a pleasant score to listen to like the use of strings, even the more atonal (not a fan of this in general but appreciate its musical importance) parts don&apos;t jar that much but can understand if anybody doesn&apos;t find it to their taste.\n\nThere is sophistication and subtlety here (not in Proust&apos;s way but in a general one), if not any reminicent parts which wouldn&apos;t have worked because they would make the film screech to a halt, and the story absorbs on the whole. The unflinching and claustrophobic portrayal of society and artistocrats is particularly striking, while the aforementioned Swann on the rampage scene, while too long, is a masterly visual and dramatic achievement. The obsessive moments have the right amount of intensity. Irons doesn&apos;t give one of his best performances here in a very early film role, but there is authority and conflicted pathos in his Swann which reminds one of the type of characters Irons was best and one of the best at doing it at, upper class characters with a dark or conflicted side. Ornella Muti is quite ravishing and portrays the seductiveness and at times smuttiness of her character expertly. Alain Delon has a lot of fun as the flamboyant artistocrat.\n\nNot without its caveats however, &apos;Swann in Love&apos; that is. There could have been more depth, it tends to be quite surface-level here, and more passion. A tighter pace, the deliberate nature is taken to extremes here and it can drag, and less scenes that go on for too long would have helped.\n\nIt also has some quite distracting and unnecessary over-dubbing, Irons has an amazing and easily recognisable voice that is wasted here.\n\nOverall, not entirely successful but with quite a lot of virtues and a valiant effort. 7/10",

Instead the film concentrates on the emotional development of its young subjects, with the central character a little wiser by the end. The scenes on central Paris in the early sixties mean that part of the film&apos;s appeal is as an historical document in the same way as Chabrol&apos;s &quot;Les Bonnes Femmes&quot; and Varda&apos;s &quot;Cleo De 5 a 7&quot;.",

Nearly all the women laughed, and an equal number of men made a protective motion toward their crotch and shrieked. Priceless. I do hope I&apos;ll get a chance to see this one, and that it will provide similar entertainment. Yeah! Though &quot;Die Flambierte Frau&quot; made it to cinemas in the states, I don&apos;t think this one or part 1 ever left Germany. The movies cannot be compared, though DFF certainly left me with questions to ponder on the nature of male/female roles."

      "reviewBody": "As with the first installment, &apos;A California Christmas: City Lights&apos; (the sequel) is not much of a Christmas film, though to be fair, it is more Christmassy than the first. That said, it has an authentic and genuine feel to it, which I enjoyed. The storyline is an emotional journey that tries to develop a better sense of who the protagonists are individually and what their relationship means to them, as they set off on their new path. Fans of the first will no doubt enjoy &apos;City Lights&apos;, while those looking for a traditional Christmas romance/rom-com will likely find the &apos;slow pace&apos; nature (and lack of drama) wanting/unappealing. Moreover, the &apos;Christmas&apos; in &apos;A California Christmas&apos; acts more as a backdrop to a romance movie as opposed to one about the holiday itself. The sequel follows Callie (played by Lauren Swickard) and Joseph (played by Josh Swickard) a year after they met and fell in love on the farm. They are happier than ever running the family farm and vineyard. However, their romance is threatened when Joseph&apos;s business/family obligations call him back to San Francisco. The writer (Lauren Swickard) does a good job of tapping into the deep love these two have for each other through the obstacles they face in the story, in the city. This is especially true for Callie, I felt. The writer and director did a good job of pulling you into her story. I found it easy to engage with Callie&apos;s feelings and emotions. I also enjoyed the sub-plot, which involved Manny (played by David Del Rio), a fan favorite from the first film, and Brandy (played by Raquel Dominguez), which made me laugh/chuckle several times during the film. However, the movie, at times, was &apos;slow&apos; (even tiresome), I&apos;m afraid. It could have used a bit more &apos;drama&apos;. The acting in this one was just as good as the first, I thought. Lauren and Josh Swickard had great chemistry again on-screen. Lauren, in particular, did a wonderful job of portraying the emotional ups and downs of Callie&apos;s story, which I found appealing. Del Rio made me laugh again in this one, as noted above. He had a couple of funny scenes wooing Brandy, which were entertaining. The rest of the cast was solid, Laura James&apos;s performance (as Victoria) felt a bit off, at times. All in all, &apos;City Lights&apos; is a new and different storyline than the first, putting a fresh spin on things for fans. It is an emotional story about love and what that means in a relationship, and about learning who we are and who we want to be. Although not a Christmas movie in the traditional sense, the movie does have a &apos;Christmas light&apos; feel to it, and there is even a tree decoration scene. All in all, if you enjoyed the first installment of &apos;A California Christmas&apos;, you will no doubt enjoy &apos;City Lights&apos;. If you are looking for a bit of romance with a touch of Christmas, then this one might be for you.",

It doesn&apos;t have the excitement and action of the early Bond films, because it&apos;s supposed to be realistic.\n\nMany people might not like the film because it shows the West as the bad side, but that was cold war - both sides did evil work.

Ray took here what might have been a quite routine movie under another director and turned it into something quite interesting.\n\n He extracted an unusually strong performance from Robert Taylor, who celebrated his final MGM film here, and drew equally effective work from Cyd Charisse, who also demonstrated her formidable dancing skills.\n\nThen there was that burly &quot;brute&quot; Lee J. Cobb doing his no-nonsense &quot;gangster thing,&quot; which always rang true.  Yes, &quot;Party Girl&quot; had lots of bite.\n\n A bit of age comparisons are interesting here.  Would you believe the actors playing the &quot;handsome leading man&quot; and &quot;sinister character villain&quot; were both born the same year? It was 1911 when Taylor and (gulp) Cobb entered this world. Adding to the mix, Ray was also born the same year, making for a perfect triumvirate. (Trivia note: Taylor and Ray both expired of the same terminal illness.)\n\nCharisse showed what a 37-year-old-dancer-in-shape can do. Dig those mobile movements: cool hip action, fast torso turns, strenuous leg extensions and fantastic full-bodied falls.  Cyd seemed one of the last holdouts as the film musical glory days &quot;bit the dust.&quot;\n\nThe post-Lewis B. Mayer period allowed for more violence than ever before at MGM, and &quot;Party Girl&quot; had its abundant supply in the final gangland sequences."

      "reviewBody": "The new Kino DVD release of &apos;Woman In The Moon&apos; is a great addition to anyone&apos;s Fritz Lang collection. Once again, the new music composed for the film adds tremendously to the experience. I was astounded by how ahead of its time this movie was in terms of its science, and it was no surprise to read that Ufa had a team of science consultants working with Lang to supply realistic details. The use of the rotation of the Earth to provide extra impetus to the rocket, the way the booster rockets were discarded as the spaceship moved further out of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere - having grown up watching real moon launches in the 60s, it was astonishing to see the actuality echoed by fiction decades earlier. There was clearly a lot of attention to detail; they even figured out ways of conveying weightlessness in space, which were pretty advanced for the time. The special effect of trying to pour a bottle of wine without gravity was both funny and impressive. The movie is not one of Lang&apos;s great masterpieces, and I agree with other comments that point out that it tends to slow down in places. Lang always did like making long, long movies, and when he settled down to tell a story, he could really take his time getting everything perfect. When this involves people just sitting or standing in a room talking, it can get a little tiresome - in one scene, Helius is trying to get through on the phone to his partner Windegger, and it takes so long he has time to snip to pieces a big bouquet of flowers on the table in front of him. I swear, it seems to be happening in real time; if there were something exciting happening in the meantime somewhere else it might have passed more quickly, but we just keep cutting between a scene of a man impatiently holding a phone to his ear and snipping at flowers, and a scene of people sitting at a dinner table listening to a speech. Not even Lang can make this gripping, though I think he was defiantly determined to try. On the other hand, there are places where it works well. The long buildup to the rocket launch is terrific - I would have enjoyed it if it were even longer. The hangar in the darkening scene, lit with jumpy spotlights as the moon begins to rise, the slow, smooth monumental sliding of that massive machinery as the rocket glides forward to its launch position, dwarfing the human beings walking alongside it, and all the beautiful changes of camera angle to draw in the viewer, are very moving. I can see why the Nazis liked Lang and wanted to get their claws into him; if they could have harnessed him to make THEIR kind of movies, he&apos;d have been a real prize for them, another Riefenstahl. &apos;Woman In The Moon&apos; wasn&apos;t a hit at the time, mainly because Lang (as usual) wouldn&apos;t listen to the studio heads who wanted some concessions to the coming of sound technology, so it was a dinosaur silent movie when the public was engrossed with something new. But it is definitely worth watching, and its strong points are worth sitting through some tedious slow patches to enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "A TALE OF TWO SISTERS goes the furthest of any Asian horror film in proving that Asian horror films are the only horror films you really need to watch. As someone whose grown to love Asian chillers, and as someone who lives for those precious moments when a film actually surprises with a twist ending that I didn&apos;t see coming (or at least suspect), I was totally blindsided by this film&apos;s intricate plotting.\n\nThe set up is simple. Two girls return from the hospital after an extended illness with their father to an imposing, rural, Korean-Gothic house. Almost immediately, their snarky, vaguely condescending and suspiciously omnipresent stepmother (Yeom Jeong-ah, who played a pivotal character in TELL ME SOMETHING) is on them, welcoming them and criticizing them in equal measure (a not-unfamiliar Korean trait, though it deliberately borders on parody here). The tension between the three women only grows thicker from there, as the stronger sister (Im Su-jeong) protects - and increasingly, harmfully overprotects - the weaker sister (Mun Keun-yeong) from the stepmother, who may be a stronger threat than either of them can handle and who blithley informs them that life&apos;s a bitch sometimes and she ain&apos;t gonna go away!\n\nObviously, relationships in the household have deteriorated to the point of open hostility and mindgames to which only the puzzlingly sedate father seems immune. Just when one wonders how much better - or worse - things were before the girls were sent away, the filmmakers drop the first of two twist-bombs that instantly provide clues to the pre-story, hints at a possible murder in the very recent past and makes the viewer replay the preceding hour in their mind from a whole new perspective. Absolutely brilliant, but it doesn&apos;t end there.\n\nThe feud continues - and the hints at prior foul play multiply - until the father decides enough is enough and finally turns to outside help to smooth things over, at which point the puzzle starts to become diabolically clever.\n\nI can see where just about anyone reviewing this film has to remain frustratingly vague in regards to its psychological underpinnings, so solid is its construction, so consistent is its tone and so beautifully paranoid and disorienting is its atmosphere that upon a second viewing, you&apos;d be hard-pressed not to stare at your companion&apos;s face (or the collective faces of an audience, preferably) instead of the screen as the realization sets in.\n\nStructurally, comparisons could be made to similar supernatural American thrillers (one in particular from recent vintage) where the ending forces you to reevaluate all that has gone before - and, of course, to rescreen the film to see if the director was sharp enough to include the visual cues you obviously missed. Only this time out, supernatural explanations are not required to understand the bizarre, seemingly paranormal goings-on inside the house. Quite the opposite, really, as suspension of the audience&apos;s belief in the supernatural is the film&apos;s ultimate goal (after gleefully, necessarily trading in spook show delights for the better part of two hours, no less), and a more clever mechanism by which to do it I&apos;ve yet to see, even in the consistently intelligence-rewarding pantheon of Asian horror.\n\nTruly a fantastic, artistic piece of movie-making. Highly recommended. (Incidentally, if you purchase the Korean Special Edition DVD, there&apos;s a lengthy series of deleted scenes that, while fascinating and informative in their own right, ably demonstrate how tricky this film must have been for the director to pull off . Though several of the scenes clearly give away just a teensy bit too much information, once you&apos;ve seen the film, it&apos;s nice to see how they actually further support the psychological intentions of the filmmakers yet, at the same time, had to go.)"

      "reviewBody": "Who is Mark Webb? Anyone? Anyone? It is an astonishing piece of work for a first time feature film director. He counts with a beautifully crafted screenplay and two sensational leading performances and that&apos;s where the success of this comedy resides. Jodseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two startling originals with a winning screen presence and a brain, yes, a brain. I was involved in their peculiar relationship because there isn&apos;t a hint of shallowness in their back and fourth. I believe it, completely, and when you sit in the dark and believe what you see on the screen, things are going to happen to you the way that happened to me. It is again a confirmation that treating your audience with respect will pay off somewhere along the line. I love Zooey Deschanel, she reminds me of some my favorites of the past without looking or sounding like anybody else. And Joseph Gordon Levitt, well, this young man is something else. He projects a humanity that doesn&apos;t need to be embellished. It&apos;s just there for us to dive into. Marvelous actor, marvelous performance, marvelous film. I&apos;m so thrilled to be able to say that.",

Much of the footage was taken by the soldiers in Lima Company on their personal camcorders. The videos were collected and commentary added to make a documentary about the life of the soldiers in Iraq during some of the fiercest fighting of the war. It is a very tasteful and well made documentary. From every day life, to fighting insurgents, to the sad but proud recollections of family and friends of the ones who didn&apos;t make it. The movie paints a picture of Americans trying to do a job as best they can in some of the most adverse conditions. Very moving and poignant.",

After seeing it was Uwe Boll directing i was a little surprised to so many reputable and excellent actors: Moss, Prochnow, Muldoon, Fletcher, Will xXxX and Paré The movie is clearly about Columbine, just like Gus van Sant&apos;s &quot;Elephant&quot; is. However, HoA lacks the quality and artistry of Elephant. And also, it lacks guts, given the conclusion at the end when the reporter DARES to blame computer games for school shootings rather than bullying and availability oof guns. Europe has just as many computer game players, Japan has extreme bullying, neither has a smidge of the American school shooting numbers. So, this movie breathes mediocrity: it&apos;s a dumbed down version of Elephant, a straight and very predictable flick. The actual horror is unintentional and comes at the end when several school rampages until 2002 are listed and their death count seem insignificant compared to the rampages in the 2 decades after, Florida, Virginia tech, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Breivik and Dylan Rooff",

Then he seeks out the American Professor David Pollock (Gregory Peck), who is an expert in hieroglyphics at the Oxford University, and tells that his name is Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane (John Merivale). He invites Pollock to travel to London to meet the wealthy Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel) to translate a cipher in a hieroglyphic, but Pollock refuses the work.\n\nSoon Pollock is summoned by the Arabian Prime Minister Hassan Jena (Carl Duering), who is unofficially in England and asks him to accept the assignment and spy the activities of Beshraavi that might be plotting something evil. \n\nBeshraavi offers 30,000 dollars to Pollock to work in his mansion deciphering the hieroglyphic. Pollock meets Beshraavi&apos;s mistress Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), who tells him that he is in danger and Beshraavi will kill him in the end of his work the same way he did with Professor Ragheeb. Pollock and Yasmin flee from the mansion with the hieroglyphic, but he is double-crossed by Yasmin and captured by Yussef Kasim (Kieron Moore). Soon the professor is deeply involved in an international conspiracy where everybody wants the cipher and he does not know who is trustworthy.\n\n&quot;Arabesque&quot; is a funny rip-off of &quot;007&quot; movies combined with &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. The story of a clumsy professor from Oxford that is involved in an international conspiracy in London has hilarious moments, like for example the shower scene with Sophia Loren that makes this movie worthwhile. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Arabesque&quot;",

My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names.

      "reviewBody": "Having bought this movie solely on the reason because JeeJa Yanin was in the movie, and I was amazed with her performance in &quot;Chocolate&quot;, so I had high expectations for this movie.\n\nI must admit that it was somewhat of a struggle for me to fully sit through this movie to the end, because it had a tendency to drag out the story in a seemingly endless spiral, and took forever to go almost nowhere. The storyline was adequate enough, women getting abducted by Thai gangs, but drained of their pheromones to make a perfume? What? Are you kidding me? The story went horrible awry when that was revealed. Up until then, the movie was actually bearable.\n\nThe fighting scenes in the movie were well choreographed and well executed. There was lots of fast-paced, adrenalin-fueled action in the movie. And Thai movie makers really got a knick for this, and this movie is another dent in the belt.\n\nThat being said, then a lot of the movie, including the fight scenes, were rudely interrupted and tainted by a horrible attempt to add comedy to the movie, in the forms of the characters Pigshit and Dogshit, pardon my French, but they were actually named this in the movie. They were dreadful to look at and worse to listen to, with horrible lines and bad comedy. The movie really suffered from this approach to film making.\n\nIf you have seen &quot;Chocolate&quot;, do not set your expectations up after that standard, because this movie is inferior to that movie by far, and inferior to the first &quot;Ong Bak&quot; as well. Sure, there are nice fighting scenes, but it is far from enough to carry the movie.\n\nAnd what was up with the gang members jumping around on pogo-stilts? That was really lame. Who fights with such toys strapped to their feet? Come on... And the whole feeling to the underground lair of the gang was way out of proportions. Where would such a place be found? The complexity of its built, the depth in which it was found, and how would no one know of its location? Sure it looked somewhat nice, but it was too much.\n\nFor a Thai movie, it was very mediocre. Trust me, there are far better Thai action movies available. &quot;Raging Phoenix&quot; (or &quot;Deu Suay Doo&quot;) might be worth a look if you are a big fan of JeeJa Yanin, but otherwise not really worth the time unless you got nothing better to do.",

Characters come and go and things happen with little explanation, if you&apos;re not a fan then you will get lost very quickly. The Yakuza games average about 30-40 hours worth of heavy story in each game so cramming that in to a 2 hour movie was always going to be a challenge.\n\nThe actor who plays Majima was perfect and Kiryu actually drinks a Stamina X to make himself stronger, i was laughing so hard at how awesome it was.\n\nI think Shô Aikawa should have played detective Date instead of the small part he played, he&apos;s a great actor.\n\nYou can tell this is Takashi Miike straight away, it isn&apos;t as out there or extreme as some of his more well know films but it has his trademark offbeat style and there are many actors you&apos;ll recognise from his other movies.\n\nIt isn&apos;t deep and it is a mess but if you like the Yakuza games and want to see your favourite character brought to life then this is a fun time.",

When the masked gunmen make their way into the vault only to find that the Tojo gang&apos;s ten-million-yen deposit has mysteriously vanished, an already complicated situation gradually starts to spiral out of control. Meanwhile, in another part of town, psychotic yakuza Goro Majima strikes out on his own to pay a visit to rival gang leader Kazuma Kiryu and track down the missing mother of adorable youngster Haruka. It seems that Haruka&apos;s mother has some valuable information, and Majima is determined to find her at any cost. Now, as Majima makes his way through the neon-lit streets of Tokyo, Satoru and his girlfriend, Yui, embark on a bold robbery spree, and South Korean hitman Park prepares to locate and terminate the thieves who absconded with the Toho gang&apos;s money. Later, after Majima and Kiryu engage in a series of fights all across the city, a confrontation at the top of Tokyo&apos;s Millennium Tower finds the true criminal mastermind finally stepping out of the shadows.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Miss Big Shot&apos; stars Lilli Muráti as Zsuzsa (pronounced &apos;ZHOO-zha&apos;), the dark-eyed daughter of the chairman of a Budapest textile factory. When he dies suddenly, Zsuzsa takes over the factory. Intriguingly, this 1935 film makes it quite clear that a young woman is intellectually and emotionally capable of running a large business concern.\n\nAlso quite interestingly, this 1935 film is honest enough to acknowledge that women in the workplace must contend with sexual harassment. Zsuzsa acquires the unwanted attentions of her factory&apos;s coarse ugly foreman (well played by Jenö Törzs). Rather than firing this ruder pest in Budapest, she blithely tells him that she&apos;s already engaged to a textile engineer. When the foreman expresses doubts about this, Zsuzsa describes her (nonexistent) betrothed in detail.\n\nCoincidentally and conveniently, along comes handsome young Istvan, a brilliant textile engineer who conforms in every way to Zsuzsa&apos;s description of her imaginary boyfriend. Naturally, everyone in the factory jumps to conclusions. Complications ensue.\n\nSPOILERS COMING. One thing leads to another in this Hungarian goulash, and soon enough Zsuzsa is genuinely in love with Istvan, who doesn&apos;t seem to want to get involved with any woman whose name is harder to spell than his own. Soon enough, Istvan is negotiating a contract that will get him a high-paying job in a New York textile factory owned by an American magnate named White (played by an actor who speaks fluent Hungarian with a Magyar accent). Mr White invites Istvan aboard his private sailboat to ink the deal.\n\nNext thing we know, Zsuzsa &apos;falls&apos; (on purpose) into the marina and pretends to be drowning, so that Istvan will save her before he can sign the contract. She and Istvan live soggily ever after.\n\n&apos;Miss Big Shot&apos; is an interesting paprikash of contrasting ingredients. The central character is in many ways a genuine feminist role model; we clearly see that Zsuzsa has the brains, abilities and experience to take over her father&apos;s company. Yet, in her attitude towards handsome Istvan, Zsuzsa is one more giddy airhead, like we&apos;ve seen in so many other films: a woman who needs a man in order for her to be complete.\n\nThere is some ham-handed comic relief from Ella Gombaszögi and from Gyula Kabos. There were moments when &apos;Miss Big Shot&apos; reminded me of a screwball comedy, Rosalind Russell subclass. But those moments were few and far between. Normally, I won&apos;t rate a foreign-language film if I have difficulty following the dialogue, but I screened this film with a native Hungarian beside me to offer translations. I&apos;ll rate this movie 5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Jasper is this young boy who loses someone close to him. But since this is a light hearted film, there is no real mourning as such, just curiosity, mixed with a little mystery, or Scandinavian Magic Realism Light if I give in to an urge to label this flic. Jasper goes out to research what might have happened to his dear lost family-member. This is very much like a children&apos;s detective-book. There&apos;s some stuff about a cat, and what can happen to you around water etc, but the story line is not very surprising.\n\nWorth mentioning are the limited acting abilities of Benjamin Rothenborg Vibe, which is reflected in his limited subsequent career, the excellent acting of Patrick Ytting, but we have to admit that he has the right face for the bad guy, and the awful casting of Benjamin Rothenborg Vibe opposite of Helle Fagralid: She&apos;s like 2 heads bigger than him, this looks horribly incredible as his love interest! Admittedly, she has more &apos;babe&apos;-qualities than Mille Lehfeldt, but Lehfeldt would&apos;ve been better suited as the love interest, same height, same physical development, same hair and skin tone, and, most importantly, NOT FIVE YEARS OLDER!!!! I mean, oh my GOD !!! what were they thinking!?! Sure, Fagralid is rather stunning and looks a lot like Brooke Shields and I like pretty girls as much as anybody else, but she could easily have been his MOTHER instead of his classmate. Last scene, where they kiss, she has nearly to bent double to try to kiss him! Couldn&apos;t anyone have given him a bucket or something?\n\nAbout the so-called &quot;underage nudity&quot;: Since she was a whopping SEVENTEEN (17!) when the movie was shot, there IS no underage nudity, and if someone wants to bring up Lehfeldt&apos;s upper torso nudity, in the light of the complete and upper absence of girl-parts whatsoever, there&apos;s nothing to discuss either.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen bundles of these teen comedies, and &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot; does contain every cliche in the book.  But it was made in 1987.  This was a little past the dawning of the high school movie, and the characters of the nerd, jock, cheerleader, etc. were just recently created.  I don&apos;t know. Maybe this movie was even a huge cliche back in the eighties.  But I&apos;m still gonna give it the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nI catch this movie on TBS quite a lot of times, and I can&apos;t help but enjoy it.  There are certain cliched scenes that just force me to roll my eyes and sigh, yet I can&apos;t change the channel.  Well, there are two key elements that make this flyweight teen comedy work:  Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. They both give charming performances, and have a wonderful chemistry.  Even though you know exactly what will happen between them, it&apos;s still a delight to see them on screen.  Dempsey hasn&apos;t had a big role in years, and you can technically classify him as a has-been, but he is a good, charismatic actor. And it would&apos;ve been nice if his career actually took off.  As for Peterson, I don&apos;t remember her from any other movies, so I have no knowledge of her career.  All I know is she&apos;s good-looking and I liked her in this movie.  \n\nThe story is as predictable as you can get, with paperthin characters, but as I said it&apos;s good flyweight entertainment.  Strictly a guilty pleasure. If I were in the mood for a good--and by that I mean good in quality--high school movie I&apos;d watch &quot;Ghost World&quot; or one of the &quot;American Pie&quot; movies. But if I just want to kick back and watch a cheesy high school movie that will put a smile on my face and contains no intellectual value, I&apos;ll watch &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love.&quot;  \n\nOf course, the movie has a &quot;message&quot; at the end about being yourself, and not caring what others think of you, but the message is delivered with the finesse of an after-school special and is strictly pasted on.  When you have characters that are so stereotypical and implausible, it&apos;s hard to fit in a believable message.  But what would a high school movie be without a schmaltzy third act?  \n\nThat&apos;s why I recommend this movie, just as a guilty pleasure.  It&apos;s far from great, yet undeniably appealing.  But please do not bother to analyze this movie.  You&apos;ll be wasting your time.    \n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",

Nothing too outlandish appears in this film, but it is a very solid watch. Great directing, and good acting from all the actors involved. The action is gritty and well done. It has a distinct mood, often portraying the bleakness associated with the gangster lifestyle and there is some sparse dark humor. The pacing is good, the story is intriguing enough, good dialogue, and overall good film. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "High Heels and Low Lifes\n\nThe trailer tells us this is the next Thelma and Louise,&apos; but this wild and spicy flick is more like Starsky and Hutch meets Absolutely Fabulous. Brought to us by the veddy British, Fragile Films, the same people that brought us Spice World and is currently between two Wilde takes; 99&apos;s Ideal Husband&apos; and next year&apos;s Importance of Being Ernest.&apos; Girls just want to have fun.\n\nThe overall theme is that old-time-Hitchcock-religion where Joe Everyman becomes unwittingly entangled into crime and intrigue. The stars are Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack as a nurse and thespian respectively. These are the two Joanne Everybodies with a UK twist of sophisticated slapstick like Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau.\n\nThese women are presented as smart, strong and beautiful. Yay. And all the guys are either corrupt or useless. Just like real life. Min has a dumb boyfriend who&apos;s electronic eavesdropping picks up a cell phone mid-bank heist. Mary, the actress, fresh from a looping session with an animated tomato, sees the overheard phone conversation as an economic opportunity to squeeze the bad guys. `They&apos;ll never listen to a woman,&apos; insists Driver. Mary says, This is the twenty-first century and we do all jobs now.&apos; Minnie crosses with `Do you want to extort money or raise consciousness?&apos; Mary&apos;s answer, `Both!&apos;\n\nThe rehearsals for the blackmail phone calls to the bad guys are a hoot. The writing comes from two comedy vets from the BBC, Km Fuller who cut his teeth on Red Dwarf&apos; and Georgia Pritchett from the sassy Smack The Pony&apos; and nicely directed by Mel Smith who did Mr. Bean.&apos;\n\nHighlights include a very nice travelling matte midsection when both sides rally to battle reminiscent of the opening title sequence to Knots Landing and a smashing performance from Sir Michael Gambon, the great character actor which is another word for interesting."

The clue is to love the characters, and then you would look sympathetically even to the stupid farting recital. The two old friends are in fact so kind at heart, striving to remain merry and hopeful, though are gradually deprived of every gift of life (youth, wife, wealth, other friends etc)! The merit of this movie is to speak in a simple way about big, sad issues. &quot;Comedy is acting optimistic&quot; (Robin Williams). On the plus side, one should add the great performance of the two leading actors, the jolly &quot;accent du Midi&quot;, a too short cameo by Claude Gensac, and first of all the bitter-sweet, child-like and almost unreal solution to the loneliness of the two old men. On the minus side, a bit of a hurry sometimes, and especially the total lack of skill and motivation from the actress playing Claude&apos;s wife, ruining an important and rather unbelievable character.\n\nThe best De Funes film, quite different from the usual bulk.",

      "reviewBody": "On June 12, 2000 Sandro de Nascimento stepped onto a bus in Rio de Jeneiro, brandished a handgun and demanded money from its patrons. It was just another day in Rio. Well, it was, until an unnecessarily prompt response time by police turned the simple robbery into a complex hostage situation destined to be botched through incompetence. Toss in virtually unrestricted media coverage throughout the five-hour ordeal and what followed was a sequence of dramatized misfortunes to rival the wet dreams of any reality TV producer.\n\nBus 174, is a documentary by Jose Padilha, focusing on the &quot;how&apos;s&quot; and &quot;why&apos;s&quot; of the avoidable tragedy that was this day-long fiasco. Relying heavily on in-your-face news footage that was broadcast live to Brazilians around the country; as well as in-depth interviews with hostages, police officers and friends and family of Sandro, Padilha inter-cuts the events of June 12 with the story of Sandro&apos;s life as a doomed street kid shunned from society. In so doing, Padilha addresses that age-old ideological argument of nurture vs nature. Did Sandro instigate the events leading to this tragedy of police incompetence simply because it was bread into him? Or might there be more to the story? Had he believed the former, Padihla would have had a much shorter film on his hands. Fortunately for us though, he chose to go against the teachings from the &quot;school of Bush&quot;, painting the scenario, not in black and white, but in a muddled gray.\n\nAnd so we are told the story of a child who, after witnessing the brutal murder of his mother at the age of 5, was destined for a life on the streets where crime is simply a means of survival. We are told of the socio-economical issues in Brazil, where its class system has divided the nation to a point where rich ignore the poor (unless it&apos;s to drop slabs of rock on their heads while they sleep). We are told of a government whose brutal attitude towards street kids helped instigate the Candelaria massacres (where Sandro again got to witness the slaying of the people he called family). And we are told of a penal system so inhumane and violent, people would rather die then go to jail. What we are told is that violence begets violence.\n\nAs manipulative and subjective as some documentary film-making can be, it is often easy for critics to discredit a film like this as being socialist propaganda (just ask Michael Moore). But it is to Padihla&apos;s credit that he is able to avoid this by simply presenting us with the information he has acquired. We are not force-fed opinions and told what to believe, nor is Sandro portrayed as some sort of martyr for equal-rights, we are simply given the full story and are then left to draw our own conclusions.\n\nBecause what some may see as black and white, the rest of us see as shades of gray -Shaun English",

      "reviewBody": "Plopping out in early January, time honoured dumping ground of inferior product and draped in mediocre to poor reviews, Season of the Witch had quite a lot stacked against it. But for all this it ended up being one of the better films I&apos;ve taken in on a whim, albeit far from any kind of classic or even especially good. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play disillusioned crusaders against witchcraft who get caught trying to escape their service and are recruited for a particularly tricky witch escorting mission. So we get an arduous mission through harsh medieval lands, trekking interspersed with action and capped with a nice blazing finale, and it should be a blast, should be a lot more entertaining than it is, but owing to lack of budget or balls (or some combination of both), it ends up being rather forgettable. The first noticeable problem is studied downplaying from Cage and Perlman, they have some measure of chemistry and a small smattering of good lines, but there&apos;s no fire. Both have potential for greatness, and both have a facility for the fantastical but for some reason neither of them chew too much scenery or puff with much in the way of rage so the film constantly feels like its missing its opportunities as well. The ethereal Claire Foy suffers similarly as the witch, she has a sweetly otherworldly way to her and lights up the screen, so its a shame she doesn&apos;t have more to do. As for Christopher Lee, well he&apos;s barely in it and just about anybody else would have been a worthy substitute. These problems aside Season of the Witch manages to be quite good fun for enough of the time that I overall enjoyed the experience. Its well enough shot to conjure an effectively macabre and misty mood at times, while Dominic Sena handles his directing duties with fair adeptitude, making for some exciting and sporadically stylish action. The pacing is a bit off but never truly dull and one or two low key spooks (the highlight being a rather neat opening) keep things interesting in between the few action set pieces, while the ending is very daft and rather good fun. If only it gelled together better, if only it realised whether it wanted to be a rousing medieval fantasy or a creepy horror and got a better handle on its tone, heck if only it wasn&apos;t aimed at a younger audience with its PG13 certificate so it could get away with a few actual shocks. Bah, it could have been a lot worse, 5/10 from me.",

There are a number of laugh-out-loud lines, a screamingly funny parody of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and a well-chosen cast that&apos;s very funny. Movie is also very well photographed, and is never boring for an instant.\n\nSome minor objections, though:\n\n(1) Robert DeNiro was funny and believable - except for his crying scenes. These scenes came across as somewhat forced.\n\n(2) Forgotten subplots. There are a couple of subplots - one with Crystal&apos;s relationship with his father, encounters with some FBI agents - that are started up, and then dropped and forgotten about. I strongly suspect this version we saw was cut from on originally longer print."

Revamped version of the 1955 French thriller, with Palimenteri as a tyrannical boys-school headmaster done in by the joined forces of his mousy wife (Adjani) and icy blonde mistress (Stone) in a murder plot they wrongfully assume is foolproof. First-rate performers can&apos;t serve justice to this diabolical debacle, which doesn&apos;t start off too bad, then goes astray. This unspeakably bad rip-off trashes the classic original with too many `oh, come on&apos; moments, ridiculous red herrings and twists of its own, and a finale right out of a slasher flick. Bates is even gone to waste as a retired detective who&apos;s investigating the case `for something to do&apos;. Running Time: 107 minutes and rated R for nudity and sexual content, violence, and some language. * ½"

Reason enough to scrabble senselessly musical numbers in the action Slapstick montage (partly black and white). Not even bearable for Trash-lovers, just bitter. Interesting: Young Mary Roos singing while the opening-Credits take place. Better not say anything about Vivi Bach&apos;s acting. Well, she is dressed interesting and does look good. The mixture of western, mafia-play and song parade in Italo-humor style is close to weirdness and the colorful settings confuse even the more. The jokes are of bad taste and therefore shooting and fist fighting is more relevant to bring on the &quot;story&quot;. A complete waste of energy, therefore no wonder that the film is completely unknown to the public. The participants will be glad to hear, that this oeuvre is just a dark spot in Movie history.",

      "reviewBody": "The role of the mobile phone, in the making of and destruction of romantic relationships. Hands up, those of you who have used it to flirt, and keep your hands there if you have an archive of secret messages stashed away in one of the electronic folders of your phone&apos;s memory. Password protection, afraid of someone dear chancing upon them, aren&apos;t you? Bae Yong-jun (geeks of the world, rejoice!) stars as In-su, a man whose wife met with an accident. Terribly shaken, he sees his spouse in the hospital intensive care unit, in a comatose state. Unknowingly, he meets a woman Seo-young (classic beauty Son Ye-jin) at the ward, whose husband too, was involved in the same accident. Slowly, they discover that their spouses were cheating behind their backs, thereby giving both another blow to their emotions.\n\nI&apos;m not really a fan of the bespectacled Bae, but in this film, he has demonstrated his acting prowess somewhat, if not already seen by most fans in his famed TV series Winter Sonata. You see the pain of a man who has dawned upon the knowledge of being betrayed by a spouse, the sadness emoting through his eyes when he reads SMS from the strayed spouse to her lover, and the intolerance viewing the video clip of their tryst in a hotel room. Here&apos;s a man who had lived in a web of adulterous deceit.\n\nAnd in the same boat, Son Ye-jin, ever so vulnerable as the clueless housewife Seo-young, who suffers silently while awaiting for her husband to awaken from his coma. On one hand, she hates him for what he has done, but on the other, still dutifully cares for him. And this duality and fighting of emotions for their respective spouses ring through the state of confusion both In-su and Seo-young are in.\n\nSure, they want to seek revenge, which I suppose is a normal human reaction in these circumstances, but how? The other party&apos;s spouse happens to be a victim too, and hereby lies the dilemma in the inability to exact sweet justice. Or can they? As they meet up more often, by chance or otherwise, to have someone to talk to, to spend time with, to have meals together, each becomes the pillar of strength for the other, while they seek to unravel the rationale of their spouses&apos; illicit affair.\n\nA drunken slip of the tongue became the foreplay, and it&apos;s no rocket science that they decide to express their emotions in a physical manner, as promoted in the trailers. Note that I did not mention &quot;love&quot;. It doesn&apos;t seem so at this point - their body language seemed more like strangers, their movements awkward. It&apos;s like for the purpose of releasing pent-up anger and frustration, of getting back and for the sake of getting even. Twisted; weird. Love? No.\n\nBut Love, probably, did creep in after a while. But you question if this is love out of convenience, of being there for the other person, just like the other is there for you, in dire straits? And in an attempt to steer this controversial romance theme (Two wrongs don&apos;t make a right - love borne out of an affair) into more mainstream acceptance, the filmmakers brought in Fate to decide - to have something identifiable between the two leads, for them to make the decision on their plausible future. Hence the title.\n\nBut the one scene which stood out for me, is the one where the confrontation is held. There isn&apos;t a need to ask point blank questions. A side remark in passing, and you&apos;ll come to understand whether it&apos;s worth burying the hatchet, or not.\n\nAnd it&apos;s kinda back to full circle, as the mobile device which destructed one side of the relationship, ended up nurturing another. Such is the electronic era we live and cope in.",

They have to ward off a gang of bandits who, needless to say, also want the booty.\n\nThis quite tiresome film is of the specific sub-bracket that can best be described as the comedy-spaghetti-western. These seemed to rear their ugly heads in the 70&apos;s, once the main sub-genre was beginning to run out of ideas. It&apos;s a typical tactic for film-makers to add comedy to a genre to try and revive it. It rarely does anything of the kind of course and in the case of the Italian westerns it certainly produced little in the way of memorable movies. Anything For a Friend feels like the combination of a spaghetti western with the British TV sitcom &apos;On the Buses&apos;. The only problem with this idea is that I have never come across any evidence that suggests that anyone actually was waiting for a combination of a spaghetti western with the British TV sitcom &apos;On the Buses&apos;. To this end it almost goes without saying that in this one the action is extremely minimal, while the humour is broad and plentiful. Not very funny though and that&apos;s the main problem. The overall result of this nonsense is a very inconsequential film indeed whose comic emphasis makes it a little more distinctive, while at the same time ensuring that it is even less good than normal.",

Its not one of my favorites, but its better than alot of other &quot;gay comedys&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "The film suffers on the big screen, due in part to the tech limitations of the digicam process and the somewhat hard-to-catch inflections of actor Giovanni Andrade (teenage Charley). The first half is slow, moody, and unwilling to tip its hand: one feels ambivalence toward the Brent Fellows character (Eban, age 29).  Publicity shots show Fellows to be an acceptably handsome actor; but when we first see Eban, he is pale, stooped, unshaven, and the picture of a shattered soul.  Those who leave at the midpoint--and I was tempted--will miss Eban&apos;s agonizingly slow growth, his gradual reawakening to warmth and human contact. They will also miss getting to know Charley, brought to life in Andrade&apos;s astonishingly detailed and sensitive portrayal through characteristic, near-dancelike movements and a slow, hesitant manner of speaking that rings absolutely true. If the parental figures are saddled with trite dialogue and minimal characterizations, I am more than willing to believe that this is fully intended by director James Bolton in service to his vision.  I have now viewed the film three times, the last on DVD, and found more to admire each time around. (The DVD brings warmth to the faces of the principles not evident on the big screen.) In all, this is an admirable, subtle, and sensitive work that asks a lot of the audience, but gives a lot in return.",

The film manages to create suspense from ordinary, everyday events. I enjoyed the husband and wife team Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) and Dr Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam). The sincere, strong bond between them made me root for them even more.\n\nThe Underground scenes with the cast being trapped inside a stationary train and being attacked by giant roaches were by far the film&apos;s best scenes. Charles S. Dutton had a small role, but delivered! There are a few genuinely disturbing scenes as the giant roaches attack young children. The little boy constantly clapping spoons was a bit annoying, though, although I understand the relevance of this character. The film&apos;s visual effects are very good.\n\nThe ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel. (Just a pity the original characters and cast did not reprise their roles in the sequel).",

      "name": "Herzog&apos;s impressive debut about isolation and madness",
      "reviewBody": "Werner Herzog&apos;s debut feature tells the story of a wounded German paratrooper Stroszek (Peter Brogle) who is transported to the Greek island of Kos to recover physically and mentally. Already there are fellow soldiers Meinhard (Wolfgang Reichmann) and Becker (Wolfgang Von Ungern-Sterngberg), who are taking life easy in the sun with little to nothing to do. Stroszek sets them to work, but soon, as the work begins to dry up, he becomes more and more unstable in the isolation and loneliness.\n\nNobody really knows what goes through Herzog&apos;s head, but it is clear he is a film-making genius and has one of the finest eyes for visuals in cinema. Signs of Life explores themes that Herzog would later become engrossed and almost obsessed with - isolation, obsession and madness. While he would later employ Klaus Kinski as the face of wide-eyed insanity, here the tone is quiet, contemplative and often very funny. The opening half of the film concentrates mainly on the three soldiers trying to find things to do. Meinhard becomes frustrated with the presence of cockroaches in their apartment and builds a trap to catch them. The feeling of being trapped appears throughout the film, usually using animals - the soldiers are given a strange toy that seems to move on its own, until they open it and find out that it&apos;s full of trapped flies; and we are shown how a hen is hypnotised.\n\nBut the comedy is soon put aside as Stroszek begins his descent into madness, holding himself up in the 14th century fortress where the soldiers are stationed with a horde of ammunition. It&apos;s in the second half that Herzog shows us the images he can conjure. It&apos;s breathtaking what he achieves with a stolen 35mm camera and a micro-budget. Amongst other things, we see a seemingly endless field of windmills, and fireworks set off into the night sky. The grainy black-and-white imagery gives the whole thing a fresh beauty. This is far from the greatest debut in cinema, but a very clear indication of a director&apos;s raw skill, and of course, Herzog would go on to make many fine films.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "According to the very wide-spread Communist Swiss film history by Wider and Aeppli (&quot;Der Schweizer Film 1929-1964&quot;, 2 vols. Zurich: Limmat Verlag 1981), &quot;(Kurt) Früh&apos;s work merged soon into clumsy goofing-off (Unbeholfene Blödeleien)&quot;, vol. 1, p. 21. According to the same authors, &quot;The 42nd Heaven&quot; is characterized by &quot;dilettante use of the film language&quot; (p. 25). The final verdict stands on p. 511: The 42nd Heaven be &quot;one of the worst movies that have surely ever been made&quot;.\n\nIn reality, this first Swiss musical is a wild Pot-Pourri that subsumes elements from Vaudeville to Dadaism, and from Surrealism to the early phase of Concretism. It has been made in two different versions, a Swiss and a German one, and in both there is a cast of the best actors of this genre that Früh could wish and for him even later generations envied him. Many songs have become independent, e.g. the Butcher-Song of Margrit Rainer. The idea that Wendelin Pfannenstiel has won a fortune from an uncle in Australia who became rich by breeding kangaroos strives the genial. Clearly surrealist episodes like Pfannenstiel walking with his bear &quot;August&quot; along the shores of Lake Zürich have become as famous as certain paintings of Salvador Dali. Had Früh already his earlier movies (&quot;Hinter Den Sieben Gleisen&quot;, &quot;Es Dach Über Em Chopf&quot;) clearly declared as fairy-tales, he takes in &quot;The 42nd Heaven&quot; the last consequences and abolished every social angles by which his forms stories were still bound in &quot;reality&quot;. The typical old-town-Zürich background shrinks into a mere decor (the episodes could be played everywhere), there is no homogeneous use of Swiss dialects anymore (Margrit Rainer speaks Zürich German, her &quot;husband&quot; Peter W. Staub,like Roderer, broad St. Galler German. The Bürgermeister (mayor) of Zürich speaks Bernese dialect (!),and Wendelins best friend Alfons speaks Basel German. Moreover, most parts of the narration are dissolved into songs which renders the story a specific lightness that we find back perhaps only in Jacques Demy&apos;s wonderful and miraculous works. A whole new genre for the Swiss movie has been invented by Kurt Früh.",

      "reviewBody": "It has become an unintentional October ritual that I decorate the house for Halloween, watch a few horror films, and, since 2009, see the latest installment of the Paranormal Activity franchise. When I walked out of the original film on that faithful October morning, I hoped that the wonderful picture I had just saw would be left alone, and not have the albatrosses known as sequels leaching off of it.\n\nNow I&apos;m faced with the fourth film in the genre, directed by the extremely talented directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who made one of 2010&apos;s finest documentaries, Catfish. This installment is a small improvement over the uninspired third part, yet it has little to offer. The characters are a tad more tolerable, and some sequences, including the end, have a bit more life in them, but when the moments examine the paranormal inactivity of it all, it becomes totally vanilla.\n\nAfter two films we finally reconnect with Katie from the original film, this time, living on an upper-middle class suburban block with Hunter from the second film. Only in this part, he&apos;s called &quot;Robbie,&quot; not &quot;Hunter&quot; and is about six years old. Don&apos;t question. Turns out, they have moved across the street from fifteen year old Alex (Kathryn Newton), her tech-savvy boyfriend Ben, who doesn&apos;t live there but might as well (Matt Shively, of True Jackson, VP fame), her younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp), and her parents (Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee). When Katie is taken to the hospital for unknown reasons, Robbie (Brady Allen), who already loves to venture into the neighbors&apos; backyard and hang out in the treehouse, is sent to be cared for at Alex&apos;s home for the next few days.\n\nRobbie immediately strikes up an unsettling friendship with Wyatt, and it isn&apos;t long before Alex and her goofy boyfriend become victim to the paranormal activity occurring in the household. Everything from falling chandeliers, to dining room chairs moving out abruptly, to knives falling, loud thumps, and alarms claiming &quot;FRONT DOOR OPEN, BACK DOOR OPEN&quot; occur and there is little consistency with anything.\n\nMany different cameras are utilized throughout the film, mainly Alex&apos;s webcam on her laptop, which she apparently carts around with her everywhere she goes. The main camera is the one on the Xbox 360&apos;s Kinect (for those unaware, a mechanism that now comes equipped with the console, which allows the person to use the tiny sensor on the device to utilize motion control and be able to control their character without a formal controller), which, when on, creates little small, green dots that glow and showcase night-vision movement. It&apos;s a nifty little novelty, and we can at least see that Joost and Schulman have respectively tried to breed life back into the way these pictures are filmed.\n\nThank goodness, because there&apos;s little that can be done with the story and the scares. We get a barrage of different jump scares, many inactive nights, and lots of abrupt noises always followed up by a startled &quot;hello?&quot; from one of the characters. These films have gotten to be achingly predictable, and it feels like every year since 2010, I&apos;ve gone on a lunch-date with a person whose intentions I like, but personality and charm I&apos;ve come to loathe.\n\nI think besides the nifty camera-work, what elevates Paranormal Activity 4 from the monotony and the drabness of the previous installment, is the fact that we have at least marginally tolerable characters to watch as well. Alex and Ben are at times, a humorous riot, and at others, dreadfully unremarkable. Easily, they are the most fun to be with since Katie and Micah, but Katie and Micah were at least trapped in a film that was fun to experience for the first time in a fresh, original manner. Here, we&apos;ve become so accustomed to this formula that we continue to anticipate every twist and every turn, and we watch in plain awe to see the films border more and more on the line of self-parody.\n\nSo, let&apos;s say Joost and Schulman make the decision to direct the inevitable Paranormal Activity 5 and Paranormal Activity 6. What they should focus on, instead of repetitive, dead-end jump scares, is giving the audience some insight as to what is haunting Katie and her family and how it came to be. It seems every film, we get a different entity and no explanation surrounding it. When will we get the explanation of Katie&apos;s action during the first installment? Or her sister&apos;s spontaneous ones in the sequel? Or what about &quot;Toby,&quot; or whoever the imaginary figure was in the third film? And don&apos;t forget about whatever the hell that was at the end of the third film, and this film, for that matter. Just another sidenote; the last fifteen minutes of this film did not scar me for life, much like its predecessor&apos;s.\n\nParanormal Activity 4 is effective in rustling up scare-attempt after scare-attempt on a basic level, yet shortchanges the larger questions that would offer insight to Katie&apos;s family if explored. Some viewers may not want to be bothered by lengthy explanations of the countless questions still at hand or the numerous symbols that have been associated with the demonic creatures in these films. Perhaps so, but to watch the fourth film in a series continue to be resistant in exploring the exposition of its characters doesn&apos;t seem like an ideal move. Considering audiences seem to be tiring from the bang-and-scare features the found footage genre has inspired, it would be a pity to see this franchise die before it can fully clean up its messy tracks.\n\nStarring: Kathryn Newton, Matt Shively, Katie Featherston, Brady Allen, Aiden Lovekamp, Stephen Dunham, and Alexondra Lee. Directed by: Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman.",

      "name": "This is a notable picture dealing with a twisted spy story , including spectacular battle sequences and prestigious main cast",
      "reviewBody": "This is a World War I story of a German effort to defeat Britain&apos;s most powerful warships . 1917 , a German submarine captain (Conrad Veidt) returns from duty at sea during WWI and is assigned to infiltrate one of the Orkney Islands and obtain confidential British information . Then the undercover captain finds more than he bargained for in his contact , the local schoolmistress (Valerie Hobson) . Meanwhile , a submarine sets out to locate and sink the powerful Brit battleships during WWI in this most stirring account of the quest for the destruction of a English fleet located at an island.\n\nStars a great main cast helped by a fleet of the best Brit character players , all of them giving stunning acting . It&apos;s one of the first and important Brit pictures about warfare naval action and being based on real incidents . Known in the U. S. as ¨U-Boat 29¨, this movie is based on a J. Storer Couston novel . Well written by Storer Clouston (story) , script by Roland Pertwee and Emeric Pressburger , the latter developed a long teeming with director Michael Powell . This is a splendid British film concerning historic deeds during WWI , the naval battle in the Atlantic Ocean between German submarines and British battleships , dealing with a German submarine is sent to the Orkney Isles in 1917 to sink the British fleet . This picture is based on fact , but there have been complaints that is most inaccurate . Magnificent performances from Conrad Veidt as the German U-Boat captain is sent on a spying mission to the North of Scotland along with the attractive as well as adequate Valerie Hobson . The main and secondary cast are stunningly incarnated by a magnificent plethora of English actors , such as : Sebastian Shaw , Marius Goring , June Duprez , Helen Haye , Mary Morris , and brief uncredited appearances from Jack Lambert , Howard Marion-Crawford , Bernard Miles , Graham Stark , Torin Thatcher ; subsequently , some of them developing notorious Hollywood/British careers .\n\nLavishly financed by prestigious producer Alexander Korda and Irving Asher . Adding excellent scale models , though also used actual battle footage mixing with the miniatures , being well photographed in order to easier verisimilitude by forcing the perspective of the image to make the miniatures appear bigger and further apart. The producers knew that the use of scale models and explosions would have to look very realistic to be successful , as they hired expert FX technicians who were generally considered to be the best Brit team in the industry . The film contains an evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by cinematographer Bernard Browne . As well as thrilling and emotive musical score by Miklós Rózsa to be continued a long and successful Hollywood career . The flick was stunningly directed by Michael Powell . This was the first film to pair Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger followed with Contraband in 1940 and going on to become an essential partnership in British film history . Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger created their production company : The Archers . They were usual collaborators , getting together to make a lot of films . Directing the following ones : The Tales of Hoffman, The Elusive Pimpernel, Pursuit of Graf Spee , The small black room, Black Narcisus , Contraband , The Thief of Bagdad , Edge of the World , Night ambush, The Lion has Wings , Spy in Black, One of out aircraft is missing , Life and death of Colonel Blimp, Canterbury Tale, among others . Many of them are deemed to be masterpieces , and being produced under banner their production The Archers . The picture will appeal to wartime genre buffs and British classic movie fans . Rating : 7/10. Better than average .",

However, once you get past that fact, on its own terms this is rather an enjoyable little movie.\n\nKenneth More is one of my favourite performers, perhaps not the greatest actor in the world, but one who has a charismatic personality. If he doesn&apos;t quite equal Robert Donat&apos;s original &apos;Richard Hannay&apos;, he comes close and invests the role with genuine warmth. Taina Elg&apos;s foreign heroine however, though very attractive is no Madeleine Carroll and is perhaps the movie&apos;s weakest link.\n\nThe stars are backed up by a splendid cast of familiar British character actors, ranging from Sid James&apos;s cameo as a truck driver, to Brenda De Banzie&apos;s turn as a friendly, man-hungry roadside café owner.\n\nAnother plus is the glorious Scottish locations (genuine this time, as opposed to the original&apos;s studio mock-ups), filmed in luscious &apos;Eastmancolor&apos;.\n\nAll in all, while Ralph Thomas is no Alfred Hitchcock (but then, there&apos;s only one Hitch), the remake is ideal entertainment, perfect viewing for a dark winter&apos;s night, curled up in your armchair with hot coffee and toast by your side."

      "reviewBody": "`Mortal Thoughts&apos; is another of those films which I nearly did not see, not because of any forgetfulness on my part, nor from any other involuntary reason, but quite frankly I tend to avoid any film with people like Bruce Willis (you can put in the names of Lundgren/van Damme/Stallone/Bruce Lee and other assorted muscular brainless types at your leisure) playing the big macho he-man; I&apos;d rather have a try at cards on the computer, even though the two of clubs always goes missing when I most need it. As well as that, the title did not seem very inspiring. I mean, just how many films are there with the word `mortal&apos; in them? I will tell you: just over 200 including video films etc. according to IMDb&apos;s incredible search facility.\n\nAs luck would have it, firstly there was not anything else on to while away a couple of relaxing hours, and secondly a few well-written commentaries from other IMDb users (I do not take any notice of badly-written commentaries, though of course I do take into account those little mistakes that creep in to commentaries written by people whose mother-tongue is not English) suggested that I was about to see a perfectly acceptable film.\n\nHow right they were, I am glad to say. If on the one hand Bruce Willis&apos; participation is somewhat limited and what he did was really quite decent, on the other, a very young-looking Demi Moore (29 when she made the film) played a stirring rôle, which helped to put this thriller drama a head above most of similar ilk.\n\nAlan Rudolph&apos;s directing of a well-written script produced a more than acceptable result, aided by those timely flash-backs between the interrogation and previous events. The formula was intelligently employed, such that at no time did you feel you were getting lost anywhere along the line - as so often happens in other films trying to use the flash-back/flash-forward method. \n\nCynthia (Demi Moore) is `helping police enquiries&apos;, which means interrogated, into the death of her best friend&apos;s husband (Bruce Willis), and as she recounts events, the film flashes back, at times even synchronising with the dialogues in the interrogation. A handy device, which lent much to the coherence and continuity. Good work here by Demi Moore and Glenne Headly as her best friend, and it was real good to see Harvey Keitel as the detective (see him in `Shadrach&apos; (1998) (qv), Ridley Scott&apos;s classic `Thelma and Louise&apos; (1991) and in `The Piano&apos; (1993), to name a few of his best rôles. \n\nAs in all films of this genre, there is that plot twist in the denouement, but in this case perhaps it misfires a little: it left me with a slight taste of incoherence after all that had happened. It left too many incognitos floating about. Perhaps the idea was not too well thought out, or perhaps I was left with the two of clubs and nowhere to put it...... Maybe I am being a little unjust, or pedantic, as the film is worth your while with some interesting interpretations from all concerned.\n\nJust about 6 out of ten on my scale, or a couple of decimals higher.",

      "reviewBody": "While most reviews describe this movie as &apos;just an average comedy&apos;, even at this, Armed and Dangerous is a laugh and a half. It&apos;s charming, fast-paced, and furthermore, I adored Candy and Levy&apos;s interactions on-screen. One minute, they&apos;re ragging on each other, the next, they&apos;re the best of friends.\n\nThe movie also has, though almost impossible to find a copy of, an excellent soundtrack, including &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; by Atlantic Starr, and, of course, half a dozen or so other popular 80s hits. With that, the movie is also on DVD, and while it doesn&apos;t have much in the way of extras, it does include anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound.\n\nPossibly the only complaint one could make we might all agree on was that it was just too short. At just under an hour and a half, as endearing as each minute is, the film does leave much to be desired.\n\nAll in all, Armed and Dangerous is a mid-80s classic well-worth watching. It&apos;s the perfect blend of action and comedy, and SCTV fans will find that it&apos;s no flop for either Candy or Levy; even as the script is considered by some to be lacking, both hide it well.",

      "reviewBody": "And that&apos;s not saying that it&apos;s great either. It is not. But it&apos;s tremendously low imdb rating makes me wonder who the heck is voting here. Pret-a-Porter is a pretty good Robert Altman film that is no better or worse than Short Cuts, which, while I feel it is a good film, I also think it is overrated. This one is, however, heavily underrated, and they both got the same imdb score from me: 7/10 = 3/4 stars.\n\nThis is another attempt to make another Nashville. There&apos;s a humongous ensemble cast of actors, some of the best on the planet, a couple of the best who ever lived. The screenwriter doesn&apos;t connect it all very well, and lots of the characters seem superfluous or underdeveloped, unlike in Nashville where even the characters who are only in a couple of scenes are as familiar to the viewer as a close friend. I would particularly have liked the Danny Aiello/Teri Garr section to have been removed. It falls pretty flat. The Sophia Loren/Marcello Mastrioanni section, the section that most film buffs are going to be excited for, also plops by its end. And Kim Basinger, a good actress, truly deserving her L.A. Confidential Oscar, is not very good as the Southern U.S. reporter: her accent is difficult to get around, and her character is often annoying, too. Sometimes, though, her pieces succeed.\n\nMany other of the vignettes succeed quite well, although there are never any fireworks about to shoot off. The Tim Robbins/Julia Roberts plot is very funny. The three publishers, Sally Kellerman, Tracy Ullman, and Linda Hunt&apos;s attempts to sign photographer Milo (Stephen Rea) to their magazine are all very humorous. The love quadrangle between the two designers, Forest Whitaker and Richard E. Grant, and their lovers is very good, also. Anouk Aimee&apos;s section is also great, maybe the best part (Rupet Everett is good, also). I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.  I was aching for her and Marcello Mastrioanni to interact.\n\nThe ending is truly fantastic. It is very well directed and filmed. It&apos;s a good film.",

      "reviewBody": "Ghost of a Chance (aka Once in a Blue Moon) is a Japanese ghostly courtroom comedy. It&apos;s hardly great, but there&apos;s not much to dislike about it.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nEri Fukatsu stars as Emi Hosho; an ambitious and hard working defense attorney trying to make a name for herself in her late father&apos;s shadow. Unfortunately, she&apos;s not very good at her job as she continually bungles cases and fails to win acquittals for her clients. Her boss (played by the ubiquitous Hiroshi Abe) gives her one last chance to prove herself with a case no one else wants. Her task: defending a murder suspect who claims he was held down by a ghostly presence at a haunted inn during the time of the crime he&apos;s accused of.\n\nThis is a pretty straight forward comedy with some minor sub themes dealing with family and life &amp; death. Eri Fukatsu is terrific as always as the plucky young attorney. She&apos;s effective and likable, and this is a role for which she is well suited for. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a bunch of veteran Japanese actors and actresses, and they all play their parts quite well.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Emi sets out to investigate her client&apos;s alibi and ends up spending the night at the same haunted inn as the suspect himself. She too receives a visit from the same ghost who haunted her client (in the form of a grumpy 400 yr old samurai warrior who was betrayed by his clan). Instead of being overly frightened by a sword wielding ghostly presence, Emi tries to convince this dead &quot;wandering warrior&quot; to testify in court on behalf of her client. He reluctantly agrees to do so in exchange for her clearing his good name and receiving a proper memorial to send him on to the afterlife.\n\nThis plot is obviously quite ludicrous, but that doesn&apos;t prevent the movie from being an enjoyable watch anyway. This is a comedy after all, and the end product is satisfactorily entertaining. Emi and the &quot;Wandering Warrior&quot; quickly form a bond and understanding, others belonging to the afterlife chip in along the way, various scientific and supernatural methods are employed to convince the non believers, and as a result, the most fantastical murder trial in the history of Japan is underway. \n\nI found this movie to be quite enjoyable. I can&apos;t whole heartedly say that is a &quot;MUST SEE&quot;, but it does work quite well overall. My biggest complaint (as is the case with many Asian films) is that it is simply too long; there is no reason or excuse for this movie to clock in at 2.25 hours. They could have easily cut a few scenes here or there, or deleted the mostly irrelevant boyfriend/live in actor sub plot, in order to better streamline this flick into a more economical production. That being said (written), I do recommend it as a decent and worthwhile diversion!\n\nHmmmm. I&apos;m giving it 7 out of 10 stars. I probably would have rated it approx 65-75% under a different format, but here on IMDb it&apos;s either 6 or 7, so 7 it is IMO!",

      "reviewBody": "Innocence is a unique film that defies typical description and ignores filmmaking conventions. If you like films that confuse and surprise, you just might love this. If you need something loud, viscerally exhilarating or explicit, look elsewhere. Innocence is a film that plays with our preconceived notions about underage female sexuality. If you enjoy Suspiria of (the real) Alice in Wonderland this little-seen French gem comes highly recommended. However, this film does not glorify in cute girls dancing or wandering through fantastical dreamworlds. Yes, it is dreamlike and mystifying, but this is not Dario Argento.\n\nInnocence approaches Picnic at Hanging Rock&apos;s dreamlike quality. What it manages to achieve is presenting what is both natural but unfamiliar through the eyes the young girls experiencing it. Innocence film is very dreamlike and doesn&apos;t rest on one main character&apos;s perspective. \n\nInnocence is both haunting and sweet. This is a film about the loss of innocence in young girls, but it toys with our notions of innocence, sexuality and objectification. In short, what does being a woman today mean? You won&apos;t be satisfied though one viewing of this film. If watching something once only makes you want to see it again, it must be worth it. \n\nSeek this out. Pass over the latest trending rental and add this to your Netflix queue.",

The ingenious of this film is that it is such a simple idea twisted around and made brilliant. The story is genius. Vondie Curtis Hall does his best to dramatize every small event and does a great job. If Tupac would have lived, I would have loved to see him with Vondie Curtis Hall more often. I really can&apos;t say enough about how wonderful this film is. It&apos;s a new look at the street life and the impact that drugs have on many neighborhoods and kids in this country. The main reason this film was so great was the excellent performances. In most of my reviews I boast on how well the actors are. This is only because it takes a great actor to portray the written word onto the screen. Tupac was brilliant with endless amounts of talent that was wasted. This is the one film that we can look back on and argue the fact that he was multi talented beyond his career in hip hop. Other films were there and where great. But, the difference is obvious.

      "reviewBody": "The Return (1982) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nJennifer (Cybill Shepherd) is a scientist who goes to a small New Mexico town after seeing some bizarre images. Once there she begins to notice that a few things aren&apos;t quite right and she teams up with the Deputy Wayne (Jan-Michael Vincent). At first some strange cattle mutilations are happening but before long humans are being killed and it all might be connected to something Jennifer and Wayne witnessed as children.\n\nDespite a terrific cast, Greydon Clark&apos;s THE RETURN has pretty much been forgotten and overlooked. It was certainly an attempt to try and cash-in on the sci-fi boom that took off after the success of Steven Spielberg&apos;s CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and I think this film was meant to try and be in the same league. With that said, there&apos;s no question that they were dealing with a very small budget here that prevented that but on the whole THE RETURN was more entertaining than I thought it would be.\n\nThe film certainly has some flaws and I will start with them. This includes the ending, which I won&apos;t spoil here but I think it fell well short of the emotional punch that the director was going for. I&apos;d also argue that the film started to drag during the final twenty-minutes, which was another problem. The special effects certainly aren&apos;t as good as one would hope for but considering the budget this here can be forgiven. With all of that being said, the film does start off pretty strong and hold your attention throughout most of it.\n\nI thought the cattle mutilation sub-plot was actually interesting and it was done in a good manor. I liked how the townspeople, backwards rednecks, were more worried about the scientist and their dumb fears that she was the ones killing the cows. We get some very familiar faces here so this also helps hold your attention throughout. Vincent and Shepherd make for a good team but we also get veteran actors like Martin Landau, Raymond Burr and Neville Brand. Vincent Schiavelli, the one and only, also appears in a good role.\n\nI&apos;m sure a higher budget would have allowed the film to do a bit more but if you look at THE RETURN the same way you would the &quot;B&quot; sci-fi movies of the 1950s then you should find enough to keep you entertained."

      "reviewBody": "Hi, Well i just finished watching this, and thought it was was excellent. Quite recently I only got around to watching Revenge of the Sith. I gave it an 8, but am not sure if a 7 would have been more appropriate. The dialogue except for some rare occasions was rather poor. But anyway, I&apos;m here to talk about Resurrection. This was different. The acting was excellent. The storyline was pretty good. The Dialogue was better than Sith. Although that &quot;inner voice&quot; caption took away a little bit from the atmosphere. I watched it in Italian with subtitles by the way. What intrigued me most were the wonderful faces. It reminded me of Pasolini&apos;s The Gospel According to Saint Matthew. I was also reminded of the films of Robert Bresson. Well, if Bresson had been asked to direct a Star Wars movie. It had a kind of austereness to it. Perhaps that was to do with the budget. Somewhere (perhaps here or youtube). I read that when doing the prequels Gary Kurtz was more interested in concentrating on the spiritual side of the force, whereas Lucas was more concerned with the merchandising. This film is as if Kurtz got his way. Still you have to give Lucas kudos for allowing these fan films to be made.",

Some of the scenes including the spider scene were pretty scary!  The fight scenes were quite good, especially when the preppy guy and his girlfriend were working together to defeat Po&apos;s big, burly bodyguards.\n\nMost of the cast are one hit wonders (if you consider this movie to be a &quot;hit&quot;). They made sure to hire a young, good-looking cast including the gorgeous Karen Witter who played Jezebel.  Dr. Po may have been 1000 years old, but his choice of a spouse was right on the money!",

      "reviewBody": "I actually read the novel, and the movie is much more faithful to it than most screen adoptions. I agree that the model work was quite poor, but extremely forgivable given the strong story-line and acting. It captures the feel of the naval war in the Pacific for the Americans quite well. Since quite a number of other reviewers have agreed with me, the rest of this review will concentrate on differences between the movie and what actually happened.\n\nMotor torpedo boats did sink a battleship once--in World War I. The PT boats of this war never sank anything larger than a destroyer, and few of those. Many had their torpedoes removed to fit small cannons, useful for sinking barges and floating drums. While new craft could reach 40 knots in calm water, engines tended to wear out quickly, and in combat conditions, the PT boats were generally slower than the ships they were trying to attack.\n\nThere never was a daylight battle between any Japanese battleships and American cruisers. There were two night battles, one at Guadalcanal and one at Surigao Strait in the Philippines, and in the latter, the American cruisers were backed by six battleships, versus only two Japanese battleships and one cruiser.\n\nThe mighty Yamato never fought anything more formidable than destroyers, and doesn&apos;t seem to have scored a single hit on an enemy vessel. Her sister Musashi never sighted an enemy vessel. Both were sunk by aircraft. Their poor performance might be explained by their spending most of the war at anchor. They were comfortable ships even for enlisted men, at least by the standards of the Japanese navy of the time. Yamato was often called &quot;the Yamato Hotel&quot; and the Musashi &quot;the Palace.&quot;\n\nThe U.S. Navy did very little mining during World War II. Laying mines to protect Guadalcanal would have been a wonderful idea, but then, as now, mines were unpopular weapons with the admirals. \n\nThe final battle in the movie and the novel seems to be most similar to a night battle on November 13, 1942 between a US force of cruisers and destroyers and a Japanese task force built around two older battleships (each about half the size of Yamato). The US force suffered heavy casualties and two US Admirals were killed, but it crippled one of the battleships, leaving it vulnerable to US bombers the next day."

      "reviewBody": "An international title for this Flemish spoken film might be &quot;Panic in the Hotel&quot;. A literal translation for the title is &quot;hotel on stilts&quot; but that doesn&apos;t do the Dutch expression used in the title any good. Anyway, this is the first cinema film based around the characters of the Belgian children&apos;s series Samson en Gert in which the guy Gert living with his dog Samson goes to a series of adventures together with some of the other people in the city and it is in fact somewhat better than the average episode of the series.\n\nThe film starts when Gert&apos;s girlfriend Marlene calls to tell him her hotel is going to be demolished if it isn&apos;t repaired within a week. Gert, of course, wants to help out and brings everyone he can to the hotel to help out. Next to this red line of the story there are two crooks that have stolen a diamond some twenty years earlier and have hidden that in the hotel, and that want to get it back out again.\n\nBeing a children&apos;s film it never gets any more hair raising then doing groceries on an average day but it worked for the kid and thus it worked for me. The kid I took to see this film likes the series it is based on, and absolutely loved this film. No doubt due to the plethora of slapstick moments in it that are also prevalent in the series.\n\nIt&apos;s clearly no great work in the world of cinema, but for it works wonders for its projected audience - the kids.\n\n8 out of 10 diamonds in the rough",

      "reviewBody": "Booker prize winner Roddy Doyle , who started life as a school teacher in a depressed neighbourhood in Dublin, the capital of Ireland, offers us a vivid yet humorous slice of life in Dublin at a pivotal time in contemporary Irish history. He tells this story from the perspective of down trodden families living in a depressed yet resilient neighbourhood. What is truly brilliant about this film is not just the hilarious storyline or the magical performances but how it captures the moment when Ireland as a nation got back on its feet and began to embrace Europe and world with renewed confidence. The story is set during the monumental moments of the European Football Championships of 1988, EURO&apos;88 , when the Irish soccer team surprised Europe, and not least the Irish, with their success. It has been said that this event and the continued success of the Irish soccer team in Italia 90 sparked a renewed confidence within Ireland which greatly contributed to the success of the Irish economy in recent years, now known as the Celtic Tiger. The Barrytown trilogy written by Doyle has given us 3 memorable film adaptations in &apos;The Commitments&apos;; &apos;The Snapper&apos; and now this the final episode &apos;The Van&apos;. Roddy Doyle went on to win the Booker prize for &apos;Paddy Clarke , ha, ha, ha&apos; and is one of the foremost novelists active in Ireland today. His comedy and dialogue use the often thick Dublin working class dialect, which add to the lyrical nature of the scenes. Most of the characters are in turmoil due to their circumstances and the comedy lies in their posturing with each other in a dead-pan, black comedy."

      "reviewBody": "I thought this was a surprisingly-good &quot;chick flick&quot; until the final 15 minutes when it got ultra-weeping &quot;Lifetime Network&quot; on us, but overall is a film which should appeal to a lot of people. Yes, it&apos;s pure melodrama but: ladies, it&apos;s so well done that it should keep your husband or boyfriend interested most of the way.\n\nThis also is beautifully photographed. Man, for a small-budget independent film with basically no-name actors, this has all the visual slickness of a Spielberg film. Also, the food in here looks so good it will have you salivating.\n\nThe main ingredient in this award-winning film is &quot;charm,&quot; I would think. Everyone is pretty likable, there&apos;s a lot of emotion and the characters are very realistic. If you elaborated on the story, it might sound extremely boring because mainly it&apos;s a day in the life of two people. They both work in a restaurant and she gets fired for being late again and he goes after her to see if she&apos;s okay. As the day goes on, the two work out past traumas with the ending being a tear-jerker feel-good one.\n\nFor a film in which most viewers probably aren&apos;t familiar with the director or the actors, it is impressive. What&apos;s odd about this film, in addition to being interesting despite almost nothing going on, is that there is absolutely no profanity or sex, either. I suppose some could look at this movie as some sappy do-gooder type story, but it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s so professionally done that you kind of feel like a fly on the wall, content to just observing and being a part of these people&apos;s lives for a day.",

Media is a tool or war, and war a tool of media. There&apos;s some disturbing stuff here, and also some raw moments of human emotion (war is hell, and covering war can tear out someone&apos;s soul). The makers of this film also show how propaganda can be spewed from both sides (Fox News, anyone?) and no war can be fought intelligently without propaganda and the media. In the end, this is probably the closest thing we will get to an unbiased look at the strife in the Middle East. We the viewers feel sympathy for those innocents caught in the cross-fire and empathy for all sides involved on the battle fields and behind the scenes. Powerful, thought-provoking, educational and debate worthy, there need to be more documentaries like this in times like these.",

De Niro&apos;s role for this movie was shot by one director for a movie with a different title and then later inserted into a re-cut version, which is evident by the fact that two different actresses portray Erica even though the time-line between the flashback scenes are only ten years. It doesn&apos;t even look like the same person. The movie ends with a lot of unanswered questions but that&apos;s only because the filmmakers ran out of money and never finished making it. So all in all, don&apos;t expect a ton of entertainment out of this film. Watch it if only to see a very early Robert De Niro performance under bad directing.",

Notwithstanding, one day, once he loses his finger in his factory and discerns the first symptoms of madness in his behaviour, he becomes involved in protestations which the scathing board of directors frowns upon \n\nThis is a politically-tinged, existential drama par excellence which succeeds in being both insightful and poignant in its exploration of human condition in the Italian working class whose members are destined for solely biological existence. The stark portrayal of the pointlessness of life reminiscent of Woman in the Dunes (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Mr Petri, whose political propensities are fully evident here, passionately crafts this material and engrossingly displays the everyday dilemmas of physical labourers whose actions come to eating, drinking and doing their work which is humiliatingly and moronically simple. The frequent juxtaposition of a man and a factory infuses into this film gloom and dreariness which is difficult to bear with. The indication that one might sweep away the meaningless of an individual only through sexual consolation is very disquieting and the depiction of the sombreness and the repetitiveness of each day of life solidifies the sepulchral tone. Just like Petri&apos;s earlier I giorni contati (1962), The Working Class Goes to Heaven is a blend of existentialism and neorealism polished to perfection in Petri&apos;s hands whose meticulous stylization renders the concept as sulky and austere as the sterile, industrialized decor of Il deserto rosso (1964) by Michelangelo Antonioni. Lulù Massa – the main character of this flick –is the outcome of the mechanization of the unit whose productivity is the only value for his employer. Lulù is the most assiduous worker which arouses abhorrence in his colleagues. He does not attach any great importance to his mental and physical health and he thinks that there is no big difference between dying in his factory and somewhere else. Initially, he cannot comprehend why everybody is against him, but once he accidentally loses his finger and notices that he embarks on following the lane of insanity through his obsessive demeanour towards order, he regains his sight and perceives the world differently.\n\nEven though The Working Class Goes to Heaven is not as Kafkaesque as The Assassin (1961) and Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970), it appears to refer to Kafka&apos;s short story A Report to an Academy which is about an ape which learns to behave like a human. During his visit in a mental institution where he meets a veteran ex-blue collar Militina, Lulù is shown an article from a newspaper which recounts a story of a chimpanzee which believes in its humanity. Petri seems to liken the Kafka&apos;s ape and Lulù, notwithstanding, whilst the monkey from Kafka&apos;s tale obtains a new identity by approving of milieu repressing it and adjusting to its new entourage, Lulù Massa restores his personality on account of a calamity and the stifling milieu of his factory, hence, just like in case of Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, Mr Petri once again turns the world of Franz Kafka upside down.\n\nBesides dilating upon the harsh fate of the working class, the director likewise hints at the exploitation of labourers from the poverty-pervaded southern Italy. Other Italian intelectualists such as Pier Paolo Pasolini also alluded to this phenomenon. Mise-en-scene by Elio Petri is exquisite and thoroughly unfaltering in its exposing the major concept. The resonance of his last acclaimed opus is indubitably enormous. Apart from delving in the issue of alienation and helplessness, the highly flamboyant subplots reinforce the main theme and endow it with abundant background and owing to relatively deliberate pace, the content is never lunged too hastily.\n\nThe acting is simply excellent throughout the entire motion picture. Gian Maria Volonté conveys to his role such a great portion of galvanizing rampage that he ravishes with his commitment to his part which might be one the most powerful in his utter career. There are other phenomenal performers in the cast, such as facially distinctive Mariangela Melato, Flavio Bucci, and last but not least enthrallingly convincing Salvo Randone.\n\nThe subsidiary cinematography by Luigi Kuveiller is obviously a determinant of quality, but what emerges from his beauteous takes of impoverished flats of physical workers is the mutual sway between Bertolucci and Petri. Bernardo Bertolucci conceded his fascination with merging existentialism and neorealism in I giorni contati by Petri, and Petri seemed to be enchanted by the lighting and visual aspect in The Conformist (1970) which was visible in the case of The Working Class Goes to Heaven. The shots of indigent flats framed with gleams of blue radiance constitute a chilly, bitter aftertaste which exerts a beneficial impact on the other ingredients. The symbiotic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is one of the most idiosyncratic elements and the flick would feel totally different with a distinct piece of music from another composer. Mr Morricone provides us with one of his most unusual and characteristic creations which is rapid, aggressive, contextualises with the ensemble absolutely perfectly and reverberates like a genuine machine.\n\nThough the movie overzealously strives to inculcate Marxist doctrines in its viewers and Petri&apos;s appeal to social alignment is displayed here, it does not modify the fact that it is an exceedingly significant film which has to be analysed, discussed and considered to be a major motion picture which auspiciously encases the atmosphere of those days filled with protestations, but also exhibits a timeless struggle of a man attempting to retain dignity, despite difficult living conditions and tough work.",

As Wendell Corey, who portrays James asks, &quot;What&apos;s a Milford Farnsworth?&quot;\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concerned, Mary Young as Ma James steals this picture as the soft spoken mother of the outlaw who only wants her Jesse to eat a good breakfast before he goes out to steal. With her sing-song voice, Ma comes across as a kindly old lady only to resort to the shotgun when Rhonda Fleming jumps ship in her wedding dress and flees with Hope.\n\nThe plot is hilarious. The inept Farnsworth sells James an insurance policy and James in turn plans to have Hope dressed like him, and killed so that he can enjoy the $100,000 that the policy is worth. What&apos;s even funnier is that dance hall queen Cora Lee, Fleming, falls for Hope.\n\nThe picture provides good laughs and was appropriate for the 1950s light comedies with Hope.",

      "reviewBody": "TV decision-makers have developed such a low opinion regarding the viewer&apos;s intelligence that even the well-meaning and insightful reality &quot;immersion&quot; programs (24 hours in the hospital, police, fire brigades or airport custom services) must rely on fast-paced editing, on-the-nose voice-over or intrusive background music to overemphasize the heroism of their subjects.\n\nOne can easily diagnose it as TV symptomatic mimicry of cinema driven by an unfair assumption about reality&apos;s appeal (or lack thereof). Just as if the camera wasn&apos;t effective enough a window on the real, producers need to make their docs as thrilling, suspenseful, emotionally engaging and ultimately as entertaining as movies or series... and that&apos;s why today, documentaries show and tell, tell what to know and how to feel; that should be useful for National Geographic but when It deals with humans, what these programs show should be telling enough.\n\n&quot;Fires Were Started&quot; is such a program.\n\nThe documentary (or film shot documentary-style) was released in 1943 and consists on a day&apos;s work in a firemen unit at the height of the Blitz, from the phone operators to the dispatching and logistics. The closest to a &apos;central&apos; protagonist is a rookie, a young volunteer named Barrett. Before we get to the action, in intimate scenes shot in studios, we see firemen as relatable average Joes, enjoying leisure time, drinking tea, playing ping pong, snooker, having fun with an improvised piano session with the &quot;Mow Meadow&quot; song that sets the well-times mood whiplash occurring shortly before the end of the first half.\n\nIndeed, when the alarm rings and a building neighboring the London harbor is under the flames, we&apos;re taken to the second half that has nothing to envy from the punchiest reality program. Naturally the film is closer in spirit with movies like &quot;Battle of Algiers&quot; (with a naturalistic approach that could have inspired Altman and oddly enough, I even thought of &quot;Car Wash&quot;). It&apos;s interesting that it used real firemen (quite good actors) and reconstructions over already destroyed buildings instead of simply shooting the real thing, the result is a successful &quot;entertainazation&quot; of reality and without the constant reliance on these hyperbolic effects (narration, voice over, etc.) music is sporadically used, there&apos;s no flooding of emotions (Spielberg should take notes) and that the film ends up affecting you with its poignancy says a lot about the storytelling talent of Humphrey Jennings.\n\nJennings doesn&apos;t go for effects, he lets the camera rolls at every department and inflicts us many unglamorous sequences about fire hydrants, assignments and the same order being repeated five times, we&apos;re not supposed to get everything, except the essential: efficiency-driven processes, organization, and men and women working together. Once we gather that, we get to a lengthy leisure sequence culminating with &quot;Mow at Meadow&quot; song and I could see why director Lindsay Anderson called Jennings a poet. Anyone can make a &apos;propaganda&apos; film showing brave firemen defeating fire, climbing unsteady ladders, under the pressure of backdrafts or lack of water pressure, watching their comrades hurt or dying but it takes a certain coolness to show these men having fun and enjoying their time before the call of duty, highlighting their humanity before their vulnerability.\n\nJennings is a poet of the everyday folks showing us that heroes are nothing but ordinary guys, jeopardizing their life for principles, but not acting like holy sacrificial lambs. And once again, British cinema prove its capability to display the upper lip spirit less through the characters&apos; bravery or courage but their stoic attitude under the fire. Although I doubt everyone would have stayed that cool under German bombings (some smiles might strike as a tad unrealistic given the film&apos;s context).\n\nThere&apos;s one image that speaks a thousand words though, when Barrett finds the crushed and burnt helmet of a partner in the ruins and that image symbolizes the ultimate bravery of men whose job consists as facing the very fire and ashes Winston had promised. It&apos;s a sad irony that Jennings died in 1950 after an accident while looking for locations as if embodied the very courage he showed in his film. &quot;Fires Were Started&quot; is a rather minor propaganda film but I mean it as a compliment, it&apos;s a great tribute to men who fought the big fight and to a director who could have given a little more and who certainly inspired the New British Wave of he 1960s with Anderson, Reisz, Schlesinger.\n\nSo, don&apos;t let its short runtime and lack of juicy casting fool you, if you admire firemen and their heroic sacrifices all through history, this is a film you can&apos;t refuse.",

The early 70&apos;s seems to be when some of the best films in recent years were made.  This story of a bored housewife in New York who has an affair with a young Frank Langella is rarely seen on TV but you should rent it as soon as possible and witness some great movie entertainment. Frank also gives one of his best performances in this.  As a matter of fact, Frank, Carrie and Richard Benji haven&apos;t really made a film anywhere near as good as this since.  Its been all downhill for the three of them since. Hopefully their careers will have good third acts, ya dig?"

The acting is excellent, as well as the direction, the photography, etc. Many other movies have been based on this topic but, in my honest opinion, this is the best. I&apos;m wondering why this movie is so difficult, almost impossible, to obtain. I have tried amazon.com and critics choice video and neither one of them has it at this moment. It happens that many mediocre movies are available in both VHS and DVD and ironically movies like this are completely ignored. I strongly recommend the Bermuda Triangle if you ever have the opportunity to see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Most reviews by IMDB members of this film are ecstatic and with very good reason. This must surely be director Willy Forst&apos;s greatest achievement. There is a magic alchemy at work here by which everthing gels. Cinematography by Franz Planer and music by Willy Schmidt-Gentner,played by the Vienna Philharmonic, only add to the films irresistible appeal.What can one say about the cast?! Olga Tschekowa is the woman scorned; Peter Peterson is the doctor who has to make a choice between personal feelings and professional ethics and Hilde von Stolz is his deliciously flirtatious wife whose reading of the line&apos; I am not interested in art, only artists&apos; is unforgettable. Anton Walbrook as the painter brings as always his particular air of mystery. What woman could resist his magnificent chat up line &apos;You are too beautiful not to be painted&apos;! This film however really belongs to Paula Wessely. It took me a while to forgive her for appearing in the egregious &apos;Heimkehr&apos; but artistes in those extraordinary times very often made decisions which they had cause to regret and which came back to haunt them. A talent such as hers comes very seldom however and in this she is simply magnificent. As a post-script there is an uncredited appearance by Lisl Handl who was married to the co-writer Walther Reisch. He was a fine director in his own right for whom Lisl starred in &apos;Silhouetten&apos; in 1936. They went together to Hollywood where she was condemned to appearing in anti-Nazi propoganda films in which she acted under the professional name of Poldi Dur which just happened to be the name of Paula Wessely&apos;s character in &apos;Masquerade&apos;! Willy Forst&apos;s masterpiece is also sub-titled, so how could one possibly not see it?! Full marks all round.",

The music NEVER matches the mood of the film. and apparently, it was filmed in Spain. They meet up with the Mortons, played by Ira von Fürstenberg and Franco Graziosi. The plot is kind of choppy, with lots of time spent in the madam&apos;s house. very 1970s. very italian spaghetti western. Erastus and Johnny are best buddies, but spend the whole film arguing. It IS what it IS. Not bad. it&apos;s okay. when Johnny wants to get Deaf&apos;s attention, he throws a stone at him... the running gag. shows on Turner Classic now and then. Los Amigos, also known as Deaf Smith. Directed by italian Paolo Cavara, about halfway through his career. Looks like he died young at 56. odd... no info on him anywhere. only made 16 films.",

Natalya Glan wow she is pure beauty,, and sexy as well, this takes place during the Bolshevik Revolution,, a man and his cohorts are trying to wipe Russia off the face of the earth with the ampules that are filled with some kind of poison, they are attached to antennas spread across the city and once the signal is given,, instant annihilation,, but in their way are three intrepid, clumsy, and yet hilarious reporters, it seems weird how this story seems to just fall into their lap, dumb luck i guess,, time is of the essence and they really don&apos;t have time to tell Interpol, or say the police, so these brave reporters must do it all by themselves,, this is a very good silent picture, as i have seen more than a few, this is the first foreign one however that i have seen, and i think that TCM is on the right path here, i would like them to make a whole entire day once a month of nothing but silent films.. excellent film with great characters,, and humor also.",

It was drummer Roger Taylor who came up with it. It was meant as a parody on the British soap Coronation Street.\n\nBut people will see want they want to see: a group of men dressed in drag singing about being gay. And to think this false assumption supposedly ruined it for the band in the US, smh...\n\nBut about the DVD:n it&apos;s excellent. i recommend it to every Queen-fan!"

      "name": "The secret of the second negative",
      "reviewBody": "The recent BFI restoration of the Hitchcock silents brought to light the unhappy truth that the negative of &quot;Champagne&quot; held in the National Archive -- which on research proved to be the ultimate source of every other surviving print around the world -- is explicitly labelled as the studio&apos;s &apos;second negative&apos;, in other words a substandard back-up copy assembled from the shots that weren&apos;t quite good enough for the distribution print. The digitally restored version looks good, and some improvements have been made where shots were obviously spliced out of sequence, but since we now know that there are specific problems in this negative with poor editing/pacing (e.g. shots being held a little too long) and the use of reaction shots that didn&apos;t originally make the grade, it&apos;s hard to be sure how many of the film&apos;s issues are due to this fact and how many to an actually weak storyline. Given that the major problems are the complaint that the film seems to drag and that characters&apos; reactions just don&apos;t seem to make sense, I&apos;m afraid that &quot;Champagne&quot; as originally released may well have been substantially superior to the only version that we will ever be able to see :-( \n\nThis was apparently a case of a film where the title and star were decided upon in advance, and then a scenario had to be constructed around them! Hitchcock&apos;s original plan was for a rags-to-riches-to rags plot (as opposed to the riches-to-rags-to-riches version ultimately used) in which a girl working at a rural champagne plant would go up to Paris and see for herself how the drink fuelled dissipated night-life, only to return disgusted to her poor but honest job. However, it was felt that the great British public would much prefer to see glamour celebrated on the screen rather than have their illusions popped -- cinema was an escapist medium for those whose life was hard -- and so a completely different scenario was developed. (It is interesting to wonder, however, how much of the cabaret sequence derives from this original concept.)\n\nLike most of Hitchcock&apos;s early films, this is not a typical &quot;Hitchcock&quot; production -- the director was expected to do his job as paid by the studio rather than provide his own material -- and is of interest to those who enjoy films of the era rather than to those who are looking for traces of &quot;The Master of Suspense&quot;. Betty Balfour is the quintessential Twenties Girl here: wilful and bubbly with a Cupid&apos;s-bow pout, cropped curls and the ambition to dictate her own life rather than acquiesce to the plans of the male half of the population. The plot is thin and in places rather contrived, but as this is by no means rare in comedies of the period (or later ones...) I think the problem is with the handling of the material rather than with the storyline per se.\n\nThe beginning is good (I particularly liked the description of the young man as a &apos;cake-hound&apos;. a wonderfully period insult), and the wordless comedy of sea-sickness is very well handled without being merely crude: I love the way the Boy veers between outraged determination to confront his supposed rival and qualms from his uncertain stomach. \n\nThe concept of forcing the spoilt flapper to fend for herself (echoing Buster Keaton&apos;s hapless couple on board the &quot;Navigator&quot;) is obviously intended as a major comedy hook for the plot, although it&apos;s not played intensively for laughs. I have to say that this is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen a director actually get comic business out of the actual process of cooking (as opposed to simply miming that the rock-cakes are rock-hard) and did wonder if it reflected an impressive degree of domestication on Mr Hitchcock&apos;s (or Mr Stannard&apos;s) part!\n\nThe main problem with the film is I think the cabaret sequence, and I do wonder if this is a left-over from the original scenario. Instead of developing the comedy inherent in a girl who &apos;makes a mess of everything she gets her hands on&apos; (including the back of her lover&apos;s jacket...!) looking for a job, we are plunged into what turns out to be a rather confusing and portentous sequence of events, as her &apos;job&apos; at the cabaret seems to get forgotten in favour of sexual innuendo: the prostitutes, the lesbians, the would-be rapist... The plot becomes muddled (not helped by what turns out to be an interpolated dream/nightmare sequence) and ends up with the girl running off to throw herself on the mercy of a man she has previously -- and soon again subsequently -- seemed to be afraid of. Considered dispassionately, much of this section seems to be a digression that neither develops the comedy nor furthers the plot mechanics (although it is probably the most &apos;Hitchcockian&apos; part of the picture!)\n\nHaving contorted the characters into the required situation to create the final comic set-up -- the showdown of mistaken intentions on board the returning liner -- the film concludes fairly happily with some genuine laughter through unforced farce. The acting is by and large good -- save for those moments when it is simply totally confusing! -- and the basic plot is a promising set-up for a typical light comedy of the period, complete with showy costumes for the leading lady and a hint of slapstick. The pacing is just a bit off; and, knowing what we now know, I do wonder if there is missing material -- intertitles, for instance! -- or even excess shots where alternate takes/ideas were *both* included in the compiled negative for a decision at some future point...",

Yes, its production values seem crude and its performances rudimentary, though wholly sincere; it must be remembered that the budget was of necessity very low and that the actors had little experience or access to theatrical training). \n\nBut the artistry of the director, Spencer Williams, shouldn&apos;t be underestimated: his sophisticated layering of symbols and imagery (from Protestant, Catholic, and Yoruba religious tradition) and his priceless snapshot of African-American life and culture at a crucial juncture is not just eye-opening but enjoyable. And the music is authentic and first-rate.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was meant as a condemnation of Adenauer&apos;s Germany and its vicious attack on homosexuals following WW2. Veit Harlan&apos;s film was cut to shreds and no version of it which is available can be trusted. It is still on the Banned list of films in the UK and nobody has submitted it again for certification. What is left of the film is still very well worth seeing. That the son is &apos; cured &apos; is a very debatable issue but what is not debatable are the cruel facts in Germany&apos;s LGBT history that punishment for homosexuals was in law up until 1994. It is a fact which is still a stain on supposedly Post-Nazi history. One small fact is that I received a shocking letter from a survivor of those times. He said that two men entering a room together were arrested. I believe him. Watch what is left of the film and realise that Fascism was still alive and well, and who gives a damn for Paula Wessely and her great actress reputation. It was a crime then to make any positive statements, and the film that is available shows a few if you watch carefully. It is not a cinematic masterpiece but is still relevant today as persecutions continue in many countries including Capital Punishment and with the rise of the extreme Right in Europe Germany itself could still learn from it.",

There are lot of dramatic elements thrown in and the characters are given a long time to establish themselves in their given roles.\n\nAudrey Tautou is one of my favorite actresses and she has done a wonderful job as always. But her performance is very similar to what she has done in other films and frankly I am getting a little bit tired of it. I mean it is wonderful but I would like to see her do something else too. She has been doing the Amelie act for a long time now.\n\nNothing is really new in the movie but execution is different, which kept me hooked. All in all, a very enjoyable movie.",

A fine example of what genre movies can really do."

      "reviewBody": "The romantic comedy, &apos;Sliding Doors&apos;, is a great look at how quickly a person&apos;s life can change in a matter of moments. By taking one path instead of another, forming a tantalizing &apos;what if?&apos; In fact this movie gives the impression that some things are meant to be known, while some things are not.\n\nLondon publicists Helen, is effortlessly sliding between parallel storylines that show what happens if she does or does not catch a morning train back to her apartment. Love. Romantic entanglements. Deception. Trust. Friendship. Comedy. All come into focus back and forth, overlap, then surprisingly converge in one of the great romantic comedy films in years.\n\n Sliding doors is one of the best films that Gwyneth Paltrow has done. It has it all, humour, anger, sadness, love, compassion and a lot of lying. This movie is most special for the way the two storylines overlap, making this a very original movie. Paltrow&apos;s performance is grand as the &apos;hurt Helen&apos; or the very &apos;naïve Helen&apos;, depending on which parts of the film you are watching. Some of her lines are priceless. Paltrow has had a very celebrated career in acting and of late singing and deserves all the accolades she gets. It was also refreshing to watch her in the murder thriller &apos;The perfect murder&apos;, along with screen legend Michael Douglas.\n\n Yet there are some other great performances in this film. John Hannah was exceptional as the sensitive and understanding &apos;James&apos;, who is helping the &apos;hurt Helen&apos; back to being her &apos;old self&apos;. Then you have the cheating boy &apos;Jerry&apos; played by John Lynch, who was using the &apos;naïve Helen&apos; to live out a very adulterous and selfish lifestyle. It was very funny to see the way he handled the situation with Helen actually. Then to top it all off, we get a great performance from Jeanne Tripplehorn, who was Jerry&apos;s girlfriend on the side, who gives Jerry a very difficult time in both parts of the story.\n\n This film also has an impressive soundtrack. With acts like Blair, the Brand New Heavies, Dodgy, Jamiroquai and the Space Monkeys. Yet there are two very famous parts to this soundtrack. One is Elton John, who is given a bad mention in the movie, when Jerry is caught in a most precarious of positions while playing the Elton John song, &apos;Honky Cat&apos;. However the best song on the whole soundtrack comes from the band Aqua, with the tune &apos;Turn Back Time&apos;, which suited the film perfectly. The film clip to this song is also very good.\n\nSliding doors is one of those feel good movies, which can also make you feel sad as well. It shows how difficult life can be in a relationship and how important relationships can be as well. It also proves that relationships are extremely hard work and you need to find someone who you trust and love and that you get the same feelings back in return. If you want to see the good and bad sides of love take a look at this romantic classic.\n\nCMRS gives &apos;Sliding Doors&apos;: 4.5 (Very Good- Brilliant Film)"

      "reviewBody": "DAMES (Warner Brothers, 1934), directed by Ray Enright, with choreography by Busby Berkeley, is another backstage story with more music than plot. The central character is Ezra Ounce (Hugh Herbert), an eccentric millionaire and founder of the Ounce Foundation of American Morals, who wants to spend his money improving other people&apos;s morals. He decides to spend a month at his cousin Mathilda Hemingway&apos;s New York home (ZaSu Pitts), to see that she and her husband, Horace (Guy Kibbee) and their daughter, Barbara (Ruby Keeler) have been living clean moral lives. If so, the family then will inherit his $10 million. Aside from not liking women (!), the only other thing Ezra cannot tolerate is show people. It so happens that Barbara is in love with Jimmy Higgens (Dick Powell, in an energetic performance), a playwright/ composer who hopes to find a backer for his show, &quot;Sweet and Hot,&quot; and her father, Horace, has encountered Mabel Anderson (Joan Blondell), a stranded showgirl, in his train compartment, leaving her money and his business card with a note written in the back &quot;please do not mention this unfortunate incident to a soul.&quot; After Mabel meets up with Jimmy and his troupe, and learns that Barbara is the daughter of the &quot;sugar daddy&quot; Horace, she comes upon an idea of how to get the money from him to back Jimmy&apos;s musical show. Yes, by doing some gold digging.\n\nSongs featured in the story: &quot;When You Were a Smile on Your Mother&apos;s Lips, and a Twinkle in Your Daddy&apos;s Eye&quot; (possibly the longest title for a single song/written by Irving Kahal and Sammy Fain); &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; (by Harry Warren and Al Dubin) and &quot;Try to See It My Way&quot; (by Mort Dixon and Allie Wrubel). For the Broadway production numbers, all written by Warren and Dubin, and running about 10 minutes each, first comes Joan Blondell dressed in turn of the century clothes performing and singing with other laundry girls to the amusing &quot;The Girl at the Ironing Board&quot; which includes one witty lyric, &apos;When I&apos;m off on Sundays, I miss all these undies&apos;; followed by &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; sung by Powell to Keeler, with girls using picture puzzles of Keeler that later fit together to form one gigantic picture of Keeler&apos;s face; and &quot;Dames&quot; sung by Powell, performed by a parade of pretty chorines dressed in white blouses and black tights doing their geometric patterns, tap dancing, and Berkeley going crazy with his camera tricks, facial close-ups, leg tunnels, etc. Before the show meets up with a riot started by Ezra&apos;s stooges, Blondell comes out center stage in baby clothes singing &quot;Try to See It My Way, Baby&quot; along with other chorines.\n\nI find DAMES acceptable entertainment, although some of the comedy may be trite, with both plot and production numbers starting to repeat themselves. While many critics mention that Ruby Keeler lacks in acting ability, I find her bad acting very noticeable here more than in any of her other movies, past and future, especially when she plays angry and jealous over Powell&apos;s attention towards Blondell. This is one of those rare exceptions that I did find her performance annoying than likable. It&apos;s interesting to note however that with all the songs, she doesn&apos;t get to sing any of them (excluding briefly talking her lyric to &quot;Eyes for You&quot;), and tap dances a minute or two to piano playing to the tune &quot;Dames&quot; during a pre-Broadway tryout. DAMES also marks the fourth and final Powell-Keeler-Berkeley collaboration. In the age of 1930s screwball comedy, Pitts, Kibbee and Herbert fit their character roles perfectly, and all manage to later get drunk after drinking Dr. Silver&apos;s Golden Elixer. Also in the cast are Leila Bennett as the bewildered housekeeper, Laura; Johnny Arthur as Billings, Ounce&apos;s personal secretary; and songwriter Sammy Fain appearing as songwriter, Buttercup Baumer. One final note, &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; should have at least been nominated for Academy Award as Best Song of 1934. (***)",

Lots of cameo&apos;s in this one, so you movie lovers keep an eye out. See if you can spot Freakshow from &quot;White Castle&quot; in a completely reversed role. If you&apos;re a fan of the first one, you will absolutely love &quot;Guantanamo Bay.&quot; Go Roldy!! Go Kumi!!",

      "name": "Luminous Lombard Glides Over Screwball Classic on Tabloid Journalism",
      "reviewBody": "The incandescent Carole Lombard was simply the most beautiful comedienne during Hollywood&apos;s golden era of the 1930&apos;s. In fact, the one conceit of the film is how her stunning glamour, especially in the newspaper photos, seems at odds with the innocent small-town girl she portrays in this 1937 screwball comedy classic directed in lickety-split fashion by the two-fisted William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wellman. Lombard never let her beauty get in the way of being funny, and her effervescent manner makes her seem dotty enough to make the crazy situations she gets into believable. Moreover, the film&apos;s constant tweaking at the public obsession over a young woman&apos;s impending death predates the concept of reality programming by nearly 70 years.\n\nFor a movie that clocks in at just 75 minutes, the far-fetched story is fairly dense but clips by without a wasted moment. In brief, Wally Cook is a New York tabloid reporter relegated to the obituaries after his most recent story is exposed as fake. Seeking to rehabilitate his career, he uncovers a story on Hazel Flagg, a woman in rural Vermont dying of radium poisoning. When he arrives in her town, she suddenly learns that her diagnosis was a mistake and that she is not dying at all. However, feeling constrained by her small town existence, Hazel pretends to be terminally ill in order to accept Wally&apos;s offer to take her to New York City. In true 1930&apos;s fashion, New York pours its heart out to her making her an instant media celebrity. Hazel starts to feel guilty over the misdirected attention, and of course, Wally and Hazel find themselves falling in love amid all the deception and inevitable chaos.\n\nJust coming off his classic dramatic turn in the most cohesive version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, stalwart leading actor Fredric March gamely plays the initially cynical Wally with the right everyman demeanor, though I kept thinking how much more at home William Powell or Cary Grant would have been in the role. The lovable Lombard makes Hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan. They have a classic sparring scene near the end where each lands a punch on the jaw of the other. Familiar character actors complete the cast with Walter Connolly in constipated frustration as Wally&apos;s constantly boiling editor-in-chief (aptly named Oliver Stone), Charles Winninger properly pixilated as Hazel&apos;s fraud of a doctor, and familiar faces like Sig Ruman, Margaret Hamilton, Hattie McDaniel and Hedda Hopper in little more than walk-on parts.\n\nWellman displays an idiosyncratic way with the camera, for instance, focusing on Lombard&apos;s ankles as she flirts with March in an open crate or having a tree branch cover their faces during a key dialogue scene. Unsurprisingly, the director of &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot; inserted a scene aboard a plane to show off the Manhattan skyline. One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background. Not as good as &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; nor as funny as &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; is still great entertainment and a rare opportunity to see the luminous Lombard at full star wattage.",

      "reviewBody": "Rajesh Khanna had always won acclaim and registered his credits in the box office hits, whenever he portrayed a sentimental, morally strong and emotionally focused role. He also did a great job in SAFAR, wherein he portrayed a similar role of a cancer stricken patient.\n\nNevertheless, he is not well at portraying the roles of &quot;an angry man&quot;, &quot;a fighting sequence&quot;, &quot;an overly volatile role&quot; and &quot;clownish comedy roles&quot; that can all be performed in a masterly manner by his arch rival, Amitabh Bachan.\n\nHowever, Rajesh Khanna&apos;s personification of a lively, vivacious, death defying and winsome portrayal of a cancer stricken man was stupendously performed. His person consummately excels in mimicking soft, romantic, sad, morose and boisterously exuberant roles.\n\nMany people contend that Amitabh would had done a better characterization if he had been offered an author backed role instead of Rajesh Khanna in ANAND. Here it may be kept in mind that Amitabh could not match a stunning performance in MILLI, where his real life spouse Jaya Bahaduri outperformed him. \n\nThe bullock cart scene immediately followed by the song &quot;Kaheen door jab din dhal Jaye&quot; in ANAND speaks volumes of the excellently crafted direction of Hirsihkish Mukherjee and has enlisted his name among all time great directors. This song and the one &quot;Zindagi Kaisi he Paheli&quot; touch the latent strings of sublime imagination with poignant originality, which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere, among the fast, untamed, crazy and meaningless songs of this age of Indian Cinema ......which seems to be overly swamped by the temporal, vulgar and money minting mentality of the producers, directors and actors.\n\nThat is to say, there is nothing worthwhile in contemporary cinema, which happens to be laden with tawdry vulgarity and incompetent intellectual standing, vis-a-vis the cerebral and in-depth creativity of movie makers of erstwhile days.",

      "reviewBody": "The problem with really bad movies that seem to spoof a genre is that it is often hard to distinguish between where they are intentionally bad and where they are just plain bad. Werewolf in a Women&apos;s Prison is probably a bit of both.\n\nFirst and foremost this is right smack in the middle of all the women in prison movies you&apos;ve seen or heard about. Lots of semi-naked women, lesbian scenes that mostly involve fondling and as one poster said, NO SHOWER SCENE! Dang!\n\nSecondly, this is a blood and gore movie. Lots of slash and rip, with arterial blood pumping far into the air and over everything in sight.\n\nPut the two together with mostly bad acting, dialog that attempts to fit the stereotypes and well... you end up with either a great spoof of the genres or a really bad movie.\n\nIn either case, I enjoyed this one a lot more than I expected and laughed (and groaned) a lot more than I expected.\n\nVictoria De Mare was so-so as the lead. Not too bad a job of acting and reasonably attractive. Certainly though not the beauty that her character is supposed to be.\n\nOn the other hand, Eva Derrick who played a supporting role as Rachel, another prisoner and Victoria&apos;s friend, did a far superior acting job and is truly a beautiful woman. Ms. Derrick has about 20 movies to her credit, looks like all in the horror/slasher exploitation genre. I&apos;ll be looking at more of her movies. So if nothing else, I&apos;m happy with this movie because of finding her. I hope she makes it into more mainstream roles.",

      "reviewBody": "Secrets of the Titanic (1986) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nMarvelous 51-minute documentary tells the story of the Titanic, the legendary ship that hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912 and sank hours later killing 1517 people. Over seventy years later Dr. Robert Ballard set out on a mission to try and locate the final resting place of the ship and he finally achieved his dream on the early hours of September 1, 1985. This documentary takes us to the ship for the very first time and it also shows some new evidence on the various theories that had happened. Since this documentary first aired there have been many other voyages down to the Titanic and God knows many of them used higher technology, which resulted in more clarity and better pictures. With that said, there&apos;s still something so haunting about seeing this original voyage and especially the scene where the crew first come across the ship. It&apos;s quite haunting seeing these pictures and it&apos;s especially amazing that they were able to find it in the first place. The documentary not only tells the story of the Titanic but it also talks about the mission to try and locate it. Another fascinating thing are all the incredible shots of the ship and various bits of wreckage that are on the ocean floor. If you have seen more recent documentaries you know that everything is slowly falling apart so these images here are some of the best that you are ever going to see. Martin Sheen does a remarkable job with his narration as well. SECRETS OF THE TITANIC is certainly a historic documentary and it&apos;s also one of the most powerful out there."

      "reviewBody": "The Toy Box is something of a crossover between a porn flick and a mystery themed horror movie, and it doesn&apos;t manage to lampoon either of these two genres. However, that&apos;s not to say that this is necessarily a bad film; it&apos;s certainly not a particularly good one, but through it&apos;s bizarreness; there&apos;s something here worth watching. It&apos;s clear that the plot wasn&apos;t the foremost thing on director Ronald Víctor García&apos;s mind, so instead he just packed his film with sex, but there is a plot here and it focuses on a mysterious &apos;uncle&apos; who hosts weird parties in which people are paid to perform erotic acts. This party is a bit different to usual as uncle&apos;s not there; or at least not alive and the guests must perform in front of his corpse. I can&apos;t say that this film is particularly erotic and that&apos;s why it doesn&apos;t succeed as a porn film. I&apos;ve seen quite a lot of porn in my lifetime, however, so I can forgive this one for not being erotic and focus on the good things about the sex scenes - and the fact that they&apos;re weird and different to the norm is a good thing if you ask me because it means the film is a little different. Naturally the whole thing is completely inept and the acting is horrible, but obviously no one goes into a seventies porn expecting a masterpiece. There&apos;s a stupid twist at the end, but if you make it to the end of this film; you&apos;re unlikely to care by then anyway. Overall, I can&apos;t say that The Toy Box is brilliant or a must see, but it&apos;s better than I thought it would be and it comes somewhat recommended.",

A true world described with a true language and a deep tenderness, but knowing that certain situations allow very little tenderness to those who live them. A world seen through the bright, deep and severe eyes of a wonderful boy who is the focus of his family, the benchmark for his sister, the &quot;strong man&quot; both his mom and his dad need for different reasons, unsettled and insecure as they are. For the people living outside Italy who saw or have to see this movie, the world described in it is our world so don&apos;t go looking for some kind of &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; calm and aseptic atmosphere, here.\n\nThere are plenty of beautiful moments in the movie, but one would be enough to love it and it&apos;s when the father and his children come back home one evening, Tommi raises his eyes and he sees their house&apos;s windows: it&apos;s dark, no light. In the lift, he whispers: &quot;The lights were off&quot;, mom has gone away again, he thinks without saying it. The look that father and son exchange is so intense, their desperation so palpable that it takes your breath away. I repeat, this scene would be enough. But there&apos;s much, much more.",

      "reviewBody": "Movies like &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; are reassuring that there&apos;s more to each genre than meets the eye. &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; is part hard-boiled detective story &amp; part apocalyptic sci-fi horror film. The movie suspects its own plots and its conventions are ludicrous. The result is a highly inventive film with a ridiculous but highly enjoyable storyline and comically fascinating characters.\n\nThe basic plot, loosely adapted from Mickey Spillane&apos;s bestselling novel,is: after private-eye Mike Hammer picks up a hitchhiker who is later murdered, he becomes determined to learn the truth about her death. Although the plot becomes more and more insane, it&apos;s highly interesting. There are no empty twists, as each one leads to something larger and more confounding.\n\nI&apos;ve never had more fun with a film noir character than the aptly named character of Mike Hammer. He isn&apos;t intimidated by any man and denies the world&apos;s hottest women. If he holds the upper hand in a situation, he seems virtually impenetrable. This characteristic leads to the ever-prevalent theme in film noirs of men vs. women and their places in relationships and society.\n\nThe film is a masterpiece of cinematography, exhibited in the disorienting camera angles and unique and unconventional compositions of Ernest Laszlo. In fact, Ernesto Laszlo&apos;s cinematography is so apt with the film&apos;s randomness that it made me giddy.\n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of Kiss Me Deadly is the outrageousness of its final few seconds: the movie doesn&apos;t conclude, it detonates. In the hands of the director Robert Aldrich, the film becomes a starting point for a delirious expression of 1950s anxiety and paranoia, starting with opening credits that run backwards and ending with an atomic explosion.",

Songs are very Big minus of this movie. 3D is another plus. But comparing to the Hollywood standard, watching movie experience is pain full. Too much of 3D effects. Lot of powerful lights very near to our eye. Too much of fast moving objects very near to our eye. So it results headache and pain for me. i don&apos;t know these kind of movies needs any health measure before releasing the movies. Anyway,This is first attempt in Tamil cinema. Only negatives are songs and too much of &quot;near to eye 3D effects&quot;. Other than this everything is OK for me. \n\nMy Final Verdict : Two thumps up. Please encourage this movie. Then only more standard movies will come after this. \n\nMy rating : 9/10",

Anna Magnani&apos;s appallingly delusional &quot;blonde&quot; actress is unforgettable as she, with her old standby Toto, blunder their way through this pathetic misadventure worthy of a New Year&apos;s Eve. Ben Gazzara&apos;s con man/thief is juicy and sexy enough to make any woman his accomplice, willing or accidental, and the tragic-comic tension between Ms. Magnani and the thief is pure comedy. This film really belongs in the category of Billy Wilder films and why it is not better known is beyond me. Given a choice, I would be hard pressed to decide whether The Passionate Thief or Die Fledermaus is my favorite New Year&apos;s party. I cannot recommend this film enough, especially to fans of Bunuel and Wilder.",

There&apos;s a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn&apos;t &apos;hit&apos; all that much for me but I imagine it&apos;s effective for proper fans of the series.

      "reviewBody": "To be honest I&apos;m not a big fan of classical music nor Mokumentries. However, it took me the trailer to pretty much set me up for an entertaining hour and twenty minutes.\n\nThe movies introduces you with the key figures of a concert revolving classical music, it makes fun at pretty much everything it can on the classical music scene, including the movie director (even a little too much). It has a few old A-listers such as John Malkovich and Roger Moore, who play themselves, which is quite nice to see them being honest and playing a little when they have a chance.\n\nMoreover, the movie offers you some actually deep &quot;no BS&quot; insight about life and death and music, nothing too fancy, just some insight people at that world got which is quite humble and i really liked it since it inspires me in my life in turn.\n\nRegarding the technical aspects movie wise, it&apos;s edited wonderfully and professionally. The shots are composed very well and are very crisp. the soundtrack and sound are top notch as expected from a movie made by a musician about musicians. in total it&apos;s polished pretty well and gives a professional feel even though it probably didn&apos;t have millions of dollars behind it.\n\nIn total, if you&apos;re reading this review, pick up the movie for a few bucks in Vimeo on demand or another places and watch it, alone or with friends , partner or family. it&apos;s a fun, different, funny and definitely worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1946 and directed by King Vidor, &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; stars Gregory Peck and Joseph Cotton as two rival sons of a ranch baron (Lionel Barrymore) in West Texas in the 1880s. When a striking half-breed (Jennifer Jones) comes to live on the ranch, she inspires love in the mild-mannered, educated son (Cotton) and unpredictable lust in the mocking, wild one (Peck). Lillian Gish plays the mother stuck in the middle while Walter Huston appears as a semi-questionable minister known as The Sinkiller. Charles Bickford is on hand as an older man also interested in the drama mama.\n\nWhile the movie runs 2 hours and 24 minutes, a full 16 minutes is opening and ending music, which makes the runtime of the story itself just over 2 hours. Speaking of the opening &quot;Prelude&quot; and &quot;Overture,&quot; the music (by Dimitri Tiomkin) is thoroughly passé and goes on way too long at 12 minutes before the credits, which last another 1:35. If you can get past that, though, this is a great old Western where the producers pulled out all the stops to entertain. Producer, writer and (uncredited) director David O. Selznick&apos;s ambition was to top &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) and, particularly, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), two other pictures he produced.\n\nAlthough critics fittingly dubbed it &quot;Lust in the Dust,&quot; the movie WAS popular with the masses, no doubt helped by its controversial sexual content (which is tame today) and Selznick&apos;s affair with Jones, which broke up both of their marriages. They got married a few years later and it lasted till his death in 1965. Despite its box office success, &quot;Duel&quot; couldn&apos;t top &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and, being the most expensive film ever made at that point, it only broke even, although it eventually went on to make a profit with a re-release in 1954, etc.\n\nJones is notable as the heavy-breathing babe, but I personally prefer Joan Tetzel as the fiancé of the older son (Cotton). Also, Peck plays the bad son surprisingly well, considering how he&apos;s known for playing more noble protagonists, e.g. &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958) and &quot;Mackenna&apos;s Gold&quot; (1969).\n\nBottom line: &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; was just too big of a production to lose. Its story, while decidedly melodramatic, is compelling from beginning to end and there are highlights spiced throughout, including some stunning cinematography, amusing moments with horses and a couple of almost shocking sequences and story turns (e.g. the shootout in the saloon and, later, on the town street). To be expected, there are also some lowlights, but the movie always quickly recovers and maintains its footing. Lastly, there&apos;s a valuable moral hidden within the Western soap operatic shenanigans. \n\nThe film was shot in Arizona &amp; California (too many places to list). The script was written by David O. Selznick &amp; Oliver H.P. Garrett (and, uncredited, Ben Hecht) suggested by a novel by Niven Busch. ADDITIONAL CAST: Herbert Marshall, Harry Carey, Scott McKay &amp; Butterfly McQueen.\n\nGRADE: A",

The trouble is that Tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts worker Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two dorks hit the road, the movie is just so much fun. If you love slapstick with a great storyline you&apos;ll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud!

Part riot-grrl James Dean, part goth   Ingrid Bergman, smoldering with sexual tension-- she&apos;s simply perfect in this part.  \n\nThe rest of the cast is pretty solid, the indie rock soundtrack is great, and the story manages to avoid being completely predictable... which is pretty rare for a teen flick.  &quot;Foxfire&quot; is a schlocky movie, to be sure, but it&apos;s definitely a guilty pleasure.",

They hired actors that rank from decent, inoffensive B-listers to full-blown acting powerhouses like the amazing Jan Decleir. They have an experienced director who has made downright excellent stuff like &quot;Crazy Love&quot; and &quot;Hombres Complicados&quot;. They have all the money and needs required because apparently this was worth a grant from the Belgian government&apos;s audiovisual fund (which is downright insulting when you think of some movies that apparently weren&apos;t). Why isn&apos;t this movie the slightest bit entertaining or funny? It&apos;s definitely not in the main character Firmin, because that&apos;s actually one of the few things they got right. Firmin is a comedy character known from two minute sketches, but here they give him plenty of depth in an almost natural way (almost). It&apos;s just well, it just doesn&apos;t matter. The story of this movie is so boring, it&apos;s a predictable underdog tale with predictable story developments (you can just make a list and tick them off) that just drags itself to an ending you can see coming from miles away. That would be okay if it distracted with jokes, but even that&apos;s a letdown. Firmin says dumb things once in a while: that&apos;s all there is to it. No funny situations, no quotable lines, not even competent delivery sometimes: just no laughs whatsoever. Jesus what a mess of a movie this is.",

      "reviewBody": "An interesting and rather dark war story that takes place aboard a German merchant vessel during WWII. The black and white filming adds to the generally drab and realistic ambiance of the ocean crossing. Marlon Brando&apos;s expatriate is trapped into a scheme of espionage/sabotage, and his grim, softly sneering coolness gives the character of Robert Crain an added dimension. Yul Brynner plays the captain of the ship, out of favor with the Nazi party and under surveillance, yet still &quot;pragmatically patriotic&quot; to the Fatherland. Brynner is an oft-underrated actor because of the larger-than-life roles he played, but this film better showcases the subtlety he was capable of, and at times his performance excels. This is a complex and tense war movie that views both sides through a curtain of ugliness, yet captures moments of honor and loyalty and even kindness, a facet that other war movies in this genre often lack. The realism of the shipboard action is crucial--you could get a flutter of seasickness just watching--and all of the characters show depth and detail. No spoilers here; try to find this flick at the video store and watch it a couple of times. It&apos;s worth the search."

Hyman and of course all the stuff that was done with the Minimoog. I wanted to learn more about how Moog came about, the competition, how the company went out of business, what he did from the late 70&apos;s when he left Moog to when he started Big Briar and the new Moog Music in the late 90&apos;s, etc. It also would&apos;ve been cool to have interviews with some iconic Moog players, like Bernie Worrell, Chick Corea, Dick Hyman, Wendy Carlos, Wakeman, Emerson and the like.\n\nInstead it looks like we get a director who just ran his camera for a hour or so at Moog&apos;s factory, Moog&apos;s victory garden, and backstage at a Moogfest concert picking up banter between Moog, WOO, and Wakeman, a reminiscing with Emerson and a few whacked out bay area groups making weird noises with there Moogs.\n\nEven though it runs about an hour, I had to break it up into two viewing sessions because it was so boring. What sucks is that Moog is an interesting guy, the history of his company is a great story and the iconic Moog artists all mostly colorful characters. This director had a goldmine on his hands and could&apos;ve made a fantastic, compelling, awesome, movie where you are entertained and actually learned something. Instead, he squandered his opportunity and made a real snoozer of a film.\n\nSomeone from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to confiscate this director&apos;s camera. They must have a hyperactive hall monitor over there who&apos;d be willing to do it for mankind. I mean this doesn&apos;t need to be The King of Kong or a long drawn out Ken Burns doc, just somewhere in between.\n\nIf you love synths and Moogs, this is of some interest as it shows Moog as a down to earth nice guy and it is worth a viewing. If you aren&apos;t to interested in the subject though don&apos;t even bother, it is a boring stinker."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Now You See Me&quot; is an engaging heist film that cleverly blends magic and crime, offering audiences a thrilling ride filled with impressive illusions and unexpected twists. The plot revolves around a group of illusionists, known as the Four Horsemen, who use their magical abilities to pull off elaborate heists during live performances, all while evading the law.\n\nThe film&apos;s strong ensemble cast, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Mark Ruffalo, delivers charismatic performances that keep the energy high. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, and their individual quirks add depth to their characters. The direction and cinematography effectively capture the flashy world of magic, keeping viewers entertained with a visual feast of tricks and dazzling performances.\n\nBeneath its captivating exterior, &quot;Now You See Me&quot; struggles with some narrative issues. The pacing can feel uneven at times, and certain plot twists may come off as contrived or overly complex, leaving some viewers scratching their heads. Additionally, while the film presents an exciting premise, it occasionally sacrifices character development for the sake of spectacle.\n\n&quot;Now You See Me&quot; is an enjoyable watch for those seeking a blend of thrills and clever trickery. It has its flaws, but the film&apos;s charm and entertaining performances make it a solid option for a fun night in. Just don&apos;t expect complete coherence in the plot-sometimes the magic is just for show!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a sometimes touching, sometimes disturbing, and sometimes funny look at a girl&apos;s transition from childhood to womanhood. Hanna&apos;s (the main character) life story closely mirrors the development of Quebecois society, and the film&apos;s 1963 setting furthers that idea. Hanna is caught between her father&apos;s Jewish background and her mother&apos;s traditional, Catholic upbringing. She spends her summers in rural Quebec while living in the rapidly changing city of Montreal. Also, she is influenced by Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s now-classic Vivre sa vie, and Hanna attempts to emulate the behaviours of that film&apos;s prostitute protagonist. This is a film very concerned with the beauty of self-expression while also acknowledging the challenges such pursuits present to us all (seen especially in the father&apos;s tormented dream of being a poet). Though the film deals with some very traumatic subject matters, it also leaves us with a glimmer of hope that is beautiful in its ambiguity.\n\nLea Pool&apos;s direction wavers between high degrees of realism and stunning experimental styles, and she weaves them together seamlessly to reflect Hanna&apos;s state of mind. Lovers of classical cinema will certainly enjoy this film. Some of the camera work--such as the film&apos;s opening few minutes, and Hanna&apos;s flight through the streets of Montreal--are nothing short of spectacular.\n\nFinally, the acting of the film&apos;s central three characters (Hanna, her father, and her mother) is exceptional. Hanna&apos;s exchanges with her exhausted mother are genuine and heartfelt, while the fits of rage directed toward her father are equally so. Both parents play their roles with enough pathos to be convincing, but they stay well away from overacting or exceeding what the script requires of them.\n\nYoung people may struggle to identify with the themes of the film, but a slightly older audience will certainly be left with much to reflect upon.",

The storyline involves the usual hunt for hidden gold spaghetti western fare, but was, at times, non-sensical, unless I fell asleep in the middle, which may have happened. The dialogue and acting was quite poor in parts. William Berger&apos;s hair colour looked ridiculous and at time he almost looked like a peroxide blonde. The music was quite odd at times and often did not match the mood. The Japanese DVD release version was of surprisingly good quality. Not recommended unless you are a spaghetti western die-hard like me and must see them all.",
