      "reviewBody": "This movie has Joe playing Joe Massi, one of the best sports car racers around. Him and his ex-mentor/driver instuctor named Stark, are both vying for a first place finish at the SAFARI RALLY which is coming up soon. Joe also happens to have an affair with Stark&apos;s wife, and  2 weeks before the big race Stark runs Joe off the road badly injuring him. Joe escapes with his life and lives to race in the rally.  The movie doesn&apos;t really stay on any plot or sub-plots going on in the movie, I mean it only touches on them slightly. The movie was supposed to be about a race. Another example is the strange rivalry going on between Stark and Joe that never fully gets explained, or the relationship between Stark&apos;s wife and Joe. Nonetheless This movie was pretty interesting, and had it&apos;s funny moments besides the funny dubbing job. Lots of footage of  the racing cars and Africans getting shoved around by cops, also cars driving through these cool trails, with stampeding live animals like elephants and stuff crossing their paths during the race, and at one point in the end one of the cars carrying Stark and his wife runs into a spectator and Well I won&apos;t tell you the rest.  Oh and something about some of the racing footage leads me to suspect that it was stock footage of another REAL Rally. &gt;",

      "reviewBody": "The latest film by Almodovar after the awarded All about my mother and Talk to her has divided the public opinion. Part of the audience say its the continuity of the director&apos;s talent and the other part does not like the film at all. But this division has always happened with Almodovar films, you love it or you hate it. \n\nOf course the subject of the church and the pederasty has provoked scandals, like the cancellation of the film in many French cinemas, but despite this fact the film has been the one chosen (and the first Spanish film) to open the Cannes festival. \n\nIn the film we can feel Almodovar touch everywhere: the tremendously deep characters, the unbelievable plot and the colourful scene as well as in the camera angles. All this things make Almodovar maintain a fidelity to his style. Another curiosity is the cameo that the director&apos;s brother, who appears in most of his films, does, in this case as a pool cleaner.\n\nThe Gael Garcia&apos;s acting, without Mexican accent, is wonderful and he shines as a travestite femme fatale, an icon to noir films, just as Almodovar likes to describe the film.. The atmosphere of the film carries us to the 80s thanks to its perfect job of decoration and wardrobe documentation ."

Macy makes &quot;Ghosts Of Mississippi&quot; one of the best movies I have seen. &quot;Ghosts Of Mississippi&quot; deserved an oscar in every single category that one can be given in because it was that good.\n\nI never knew the story of Medgar Evers before I saw this film; but, I learned a lot through watching the film. I hope everyone has the same experience and opportunity I had when I saw this movie because it is one history lesson that should be seen rather than read in history books or newspaper archives. I was truly honored to watch this film.\n\n There are several reasons this film is a success; one of them are the performances. &quot;Ghosts Of Mississippi&quot; is each actors best film of their career bar none. Alec Baldwin brings intensity, aggressiveness and never say die attitude to his role as Bobby DeLaughter. Whoopi Goldberg stars as Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar Evers, who with relentless pursuit of justice re-opens this murder case. Finally, James Woods stars as Byron De La Beckwith, the defendant, who with great conviction and sincerity brings the essence of the real person to the surface. \n\nAs great as Baldwin and Woods are in this they do not hold a candle to Goldberg who gives not only the best performance in the film, year but I dare say the best performance of the decade of the 90&apos;s.\n\n The second reason why this film remains on my short list of best films are the messages that brought up. For example, equality for all and the fact that any discrimination will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Another message I got from this film was under no circumstances should anybody underestimate the power of tenacity because it will make dreams come true every time. \n\nThis film was thought-provoking, brilliant and compelling. In addition, &quot;Ghosts Of Mississippi&quot; will move you to tears, put a smile on your face and anger you because these are the emotions I felt watching this movie. Combined with the excellent ensemble performances, brilliant script and messages this film had &quot;Ghosts Of Mississippi&quot; is one film you can&apos;t miss. Two thumbs way up."

      "reviewBody": "Lenin has lived, is living, will live: a film poster summarizing it very well. The atheist society of Stalin needed its own mythology, just as throughout the whole history any other society had to build its own mythology (a fiction is always essential in the struggle for survival; if Darwin hadn&apos;t told it from the very beginning, it was said anyway by lots of Darwinians). Ultimately any mythology supposes the existence of an eternal god. Of course, in the Soviet mythology the eternal god was Lenin. As he had died in 1924, the problem of his immortality had to be solved. In this movie the god Lenin lives forever in the Soviet society: in the whole society, and in any particle of it. Any Soviet citizen, and any Soviet accomplishment, carries the personality of Lenin. With this movie Vertov gives up his atheism, to become a pantheist: he deifies the Soviet society because it embodies the eternity of Lenin, and he deifies Lenin because his eternity is embodied in the Soviet society. Is it pantheism or rather panentheism? I&apos;d leave for you to decide. Anyway it is the demonstration of a perfect totalitarian system: one cannot have free will as everyone embodies Lenin, thus carrying the will of Lenin. Well, for the regime officials this movie had two impardonable flaws. Firstly it was an Avangardist movie, it means some kind of bourgeois leisure. In 1934 the Soviet norm was already the Socialist Realism. And more than that it was the second flaw. The Soviet mythology was actually built upon two gods: one dead (Lenin) and one alive and in full control of the power (Stalin). And the dead god should have had only one role: to justify the almighty alive god. This movie said too much about the dead god, and almost nothing about the alive god. No wonder that Vertov would not be let to make another movie any more. He would not understand why, as he was too honest, too sincere, to understand the ways of life. Apart from that, this is a superb movie, just because it is so consistently Avangardist (I would even say so Productionist - the whole Soviet construction living through one hero, Lenin), and so sincere.",

      "reviewBody": "Having caught this movie late one night on cable, I had to see it again just to check if it was as bad as I remembered. It was actually worse. Big Zapper is an attempt to cash in on the &apos;Kung Fu&apos; craze &amp; also the U.S female action sleaze of Pam Grier &amp; Cheri Caffaro which fails miserably.\n\nLinda Marlowe stars as Harriet Zapper, a private eye who is targeted for elimination by a gangland boss. Ms Marlowe has absolutely no martial arts skills, and the inept director Lindsay Shonteff in the days before CGI has no means of disguising this. - usually she kills her inept opponents with a single limp punch!. \n\nThe film features plenty of action, but it&apos;s all badly done &amp; the director can&apos;t seem to make up his mind whether this is a comedy or a thriller!. One minute she is punching her enemies through walls like a WB cartoon character, the next she&apos;s bloodily skewering a guy with a knife. \n\nIf the action is badly done, the comedy is even worse, her sidekick being a moron who spends the whole film trying to get her to have sex with him. Big Zapper is 70&apos;s British cinema at it&apos;s very lowest - the acting and cinematography are laughable &amp; it&apos;s a film so bad it isn&apos;t even unintentionally funny. Shonteff was also responsible for a couple of equally bad spy spoofs featuring actor Nicky Henson &amp; Gareth (New Avengers) Hunt .\n\nIf you are a fan of female action cinema, this has to be seen to be believed, just to make one appreciate Hong Kong cinema &amp; U.S grindhouse even more!.",

The Albers&apos; character (probably as the actor himself) is not &quot;Der Sieger&quot; anymore (referring to a Albers movie of more than 10 years ago, it means &quot;the victor&quot; &amp; reflects most of Albers&apos; roles) but a de-moralized man who sacrifices his dignity to make ends meet in a devastated Berlin in ruins &amp; hunger. This was not intended as a &quot;tear jerker&quot; back in its day but for me as a German of the baby boomer years (in Germany the vintages 1960 - &apos;65) it makes me shed a tear here &amp; there about the state that my hometown of Berlin (&amp; the rest of the country) was in in those years &amp; how bleak the outlook of people was in the twilight zone between the war&apos;s end &amp; the founding of the Bundesrepublik Deutschland in 1949. I am pretty sure, that there is no english version available but if you have at least some basic knowledge about the german language watch it, highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Gordon Chan&apos;s Painted Skin back in 2008 had Singapore&apos;s Raintree Pictures as a production partner, with China born actor Qi Yuwu in one of his many overseas film forays, but the follow up film is a purely all-China affair, showing off what the Chinese film companies can do in terms of storytelling and effects, In all honesty, I prefer Painted Skin II over its predecessor precisely because it took its time to tell a proper story, contrary to the treatment of many mainstream China made films in the similar genre that had overemphasized less than stellar CG effects and sacrificed story along the way.\n\nThis is not a sequel, nor is it a prequel to the 2008 film, despite having to share the same title both in English and Mandarin. Most of the primary cast returned, and played totally new characters, where you can speak of this as if it&apos;s a spiritual companion to the first film, challenging the same cast in having to portray different characters in what would structurally almost be the same film, except with new themes and characters thrown into the mix, complete with breathtaking landscapes that only Western China could offer.\n\nIn this story, the power trio of Zhou Xun, Vicky Zhao and Chen Kun return. Zhou Xun reprises the role where she&apos;s the temptress foxy spirit Xiao Wei and the primary antagonist of sorts in this story, ripping out the hearts of man to devour and maintain her mortal looks. Being cursed and needing to fend off her icy prison, she got rescued by Zhao Wei&apos;s Princess, a royalty with an incredibly strong heart and a partially masked face, pining for the love of Chen Kun&apos;s General, who&apos;s at the frontiers to ward off the kingdom&apos;s enemies, which also serves as a refuge to hide his true feelings for the woman he believes he cannot deserve after being indirectly responsible for the mishap which led to her disfigurement.\n\nMost of the screen time and plot development went to these three, and the camera just gorgeously captures them all in their romantic dalliances, especially when Xiao Wei becomes the de facto spanner in both the Princess and the General&apos;s love life no thanks to a little mesmerizing black magic that&apos;s cast to help Xiao Wei in her cause to obtain the Princess&apos; heart, and become human. Sure it&apos;s a merry-go-round manner, but we learn certain rules of the game, where a transformation can only take place should a heart be willingly given up, as opposed to forcefully obtained by the demon. And in fact this issue is central and broached more than once in the film.\n\nIt revolves around the themes of unrequited love, sacrifice, and the long held belief that we are attracted to beautiful, flawless things, even if it&apos;s something a superficial as a woman&apos;s looks. The characters go back and forth in dealing with their emotions, and thankfully this served as sufficient back story to their individual characters, allowing a multi-faceted dimension to them, which of course worked wonders for its running time of over two hours. This in addition to the wonderful deliberate visuals that director Wuershan had given this film that the first one didn&apos;t possess.\n\nZhou Xun plays it cool this time round as the scheming Xiao Wei who would discover that being human isn&apos;t all that easy given that she has had powers easily taken for granted. Zhao Wei continues in her roles as warrior princesses from Red Cliff and Mulan, and plays to perfection the role of a woman willing to give up anything to be with the man she truly likes. And with two strong female leads playing opposite him, Chen Kun could well be regarded as the current Mr Popular with real acting ability, given license to brood most of the time as the conflicted General who isn&apos;t too aware that his eyes were stamped and cursed, leading him away from, and providing him reason enough to stray. The performances of these three together can go on forever.\n\nGranted though with the increase in time dedicated for a special effects showcase, and an unwavering focus on characters, what had to give was the martial arts and fight scenes, which pale in scenes if compared to the first film. The martial arts practitioners were clearly reduced, and the antagonists in the form of the Wolf clan&apos;s Shaman (Kris Philips) and Queen (Chen Tingjia) didn&apos;t quite provide any real threat save for their sheer numbers of faceless army goons they bring to the fray. Their objective though brings the story full circle, with Mini Yang and Feng Shao-Feng&apos;s characters as Xiao Wei&apos;s bird companion, and a bumbling demon-slayer respectively, were in just to add to star power and for minor comic relief, being in tangent sub-plots that serve little to the main story.\n\nStill, Painted Skin: The Resurrection actually revived some hopes that the Chinese film industry is capable of coming up with visually attractive, action-adventures that tap on the Liao Zhai sources, if elements in the film were well balanced with an adequate story, backed by solid cast members. And having some really sensual scenes in the film didn&apos;t hurt it at all given enough of them to highlight the man-demon transformation which was almost extreme Face-Off like, but in a sexier fashion. Recommended!",

My grandparents were in a different part of China that also got occupied where similar tragedies occurred. Though much much worse. Babies would be thrown in the air and caught on the bayonets as a game. There were killing games. My grandma can never tell her story without crying. The Japanese government deny this ever happened, they never apologized, and payed for their war crimes. They do not even have it written in their history books. All my grandparents want is for their story to be recognized as well as a formal apology. Thanks for reading.",

      "name": "Hooray for Animal Crackers!",
      "reviewBody": "Animal Crackers is one of the best films ever done by the 4 Marx Brothers. For a start, the comedy completely works on screen, especially considering that the film was adapted from the musical stage play. And although Zeppo&apos;s comedy has always been underrated and underplayed in the five films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures, he proves in this film, as well as the four other movies he appeared with Groucho, Chico, and Harpo, that the 4 Marx Brothers made better films when the four of them worked together; as opposed to when it was just Groucho, Chico and Harpo. All the Marx Brothers films which included Zeppo were zanier films and, to me, the best of their work. Verbally, Groucho is at his razor-sharp best in Animal Crackers, with almost every one-liner dripping with comedic insults and sarcasm. Chico and Harpo perfectly add to the mayhem. The direction by Victor Heerman showed the type of skill needed to professionally control the 4 Marx Brothers to make Animal Crackers the tremendous success that it was. Though the Great Depression was taking hold on the American psyche in 1930, Animal Crackers was the perfect comedy which allowed ordinary Americans to enjoy the spoofing of America&apos;s &apos;Hoi Polloi&apos;.\n\nThough the 4 Marx Brothers&apos; succeeding films (Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup) were even more of the Hollywood film-style comedy successes which crystalized their zaniness and on-screen craziness, one should not underestimate the cinematography of George Folsey, Sr., who made the film look like a movie written especially for the screen. The look of the film (specifically the sets) makes one feel like he or she wished they had been invited to Mrs. Rittenhouse&apos;s party in honor of Captain Spaulding. Lillian Roth never looked better, and the best song in the film is her musical number with Hal Thompson, &quot;Why Am I So Romantic?&quot; - which was the theme music for the entire movie. Animal Crackers is one of my favorite films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures - although all five films made at Paramount are absolute gems. I strongly suggest getting the Marx Brothers&apos; Silver Screen Collection, which is now on DVD. They are a must for your film library!",

The story revolves around a famous actress who is back in the limelight and trying to disprove rumors she is more than just a pretty face but can actually act. The movie plays out with the story line moving between the movie being made and the characters involved in that movie production. The movie title Method refers to the type of acting where the actor/actress immerses themselves into a role. This female character plays a 19th century killer thus that mindset plays into the actress in reality. You can guess where things may end up heading. The story is rather muddled, characters are unlikable and unsympathetic and overall, this is not interesting or even visually intriguing. Simply put: avoid.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an excellent movie, especially for those who enjoy listening to The Vienna Boys Choir. There is nothing better, as far as I am concerned, than listening to the soprano voices of a Boy&apos;s Choir. I myself, was once a choir boy, and enjoyed the many years that I sang in three different boys choirs. To this day, I still sing in a choir. \n\nBack to my report on this movie. This Disney movie utilizes the world renowned Vienna Boy&apos;s Choir, as the bases for its plot. The movie itself, is not a best seller, but the singing throughout the movie is beautiful. I find myself rewinding the film and playing the songs over and over. The star of the movie is a young boy Tony Fiala, played by Vincent Winter, who wants to become a member of the choir. When his parents finally agree, he goes, but is put on probation. One of the Choirmasters feels that Tony is blessed with an exceptional voice. This does not go over very well with one of the senior boys, Peter Schaefer, played by Sean Scully. I don&apos;t want to spoil this movie for you, so you will have to see it to see how this all works out. \n\nIn another comment, which you can read on this site, it was mentioned that, and I quote: &quot; there&apos;s a scene wherein several of the boys are required to dress as girls for a public performance!&quot; In reading this statement, I feel that there are some overtones, that are not being said out loud. If the person who wrote this, (comment on the movie), had ever gone to a performance of the Vienna Boys Choir, he would&apos;ve probably seen the boys (himself) dress up as girls. In each of the shows I saw, the boys had to dress as girls, so as to perform the small musical that they put on. It was always and accepted part of the performance, and we, the audience, never thought anything different. To me, I don&apos;t think it ever harmed any of those boys. In fact,I myself on one occasion, on a Halloween night in the fifties, got dressed up as the mayor of our city. I won first prize in our school function for my effort. I always thought that was so cool. Today, people are not as relaxed about these sort of situations, which is too bad.\n\nThis movie is an excellent movie that the whole family can watch. If you are able to get a copy, do so. They are hard to find. I was able to obtain a copy of it on &quot;e-bay&quot; and paid dearly for it. I have not regretted it one bit. I have also written to Disney to see whether they have any intention of making it into a DVD in the near future. The reply was not favourable at this time, but maybe in the future. I sure hope so. There are a lot of movies out there today that are not half as good as this film is, and they are already on DVD. So, I&apos;m praying for a turnaround at the Disney Studios.",

      "reviewBody": "Being an Iwai Shunji-produced and co-written film, I was quick to pick up BANDAGE, hoping for something original and enjoyable. I&apos;m not sure how involved Iwai was with the film (I&apos;m guessing not too much, though there are undoubtedly Iwai inspirations scattered throughout the film), but it mostly delivered on my hopes.\n\nCasting Akanishi Jin as one of the leads was a smart move by director Kobayashi Takeshi. He brings massive fan support to the movie, not to mention experience in the Japanese music industry. Playing the lead singer of a rock band, Akanishi undoubtedly draws from personal experience (he&apos;s a very popular member of the Johnny&apos;s boy band KAT-TUN– actually, former member now; he decided to go solo using this film as a base) as he plays the carefree yet troubled character of Natsu. His band, LANDS, is quickly gaining mass popularity but encounters problems– the band members just don&apos;t completely gel. A genius musician, Yukiya (Kora Kengo), and a brilliant composer, Arumi (Shibamoto Yuki), form the heart of the band with Natsu supposedly still remaining just because of his indie fan base. It also helps that he can sing.\n\nAsako (Kitano Kii) is a high school girl who loves LANDS. One day, her friend invites her to one of their concerts and they miraculously stumble upon backstage passes. The girls soon find themselves at the band&apos;s after-concert drinking party and Asako strikes up a relationship with Natsu. He&apos;s soon bringing her to rehearsals and calling her up to solve band problems. The rest of the band obviously sees this as a hindrance, though they can&apos;t convince Natsu of that. He really likes her, in his own strange and laid-back way.\n\nAkanishi Jin plays a damn good rocker. Although his character is quite one-dimensional, Akanishi embodies the rocker spirit, entertaining and involving us in the film. Johnny&apos;s Entertainment boys are typically unimpressive actors whose roles are often restrained or stiff. It&apos;s surprising that Akanishi plays such a dark and adult character (yes, he really kissed a girl–a real kiss!). Akanishi&apos;s rock star is seemingly drunk throughout the film (this is his personality) as he rambles and babbles along. It&apos;s all very entertaining, no doubt. Kitano Kii, who also previously starred in the Iwai-produced Halfway (2009), is a pleasure to watch as well. It&apos;s nice to see a young actress so in- control of her characters, I&apos;m always impressed with her. The casting for each character is very good. I especially liked the inclusion of Ito Ayumi (who emerged out of Iwai&apos;s Swallowtail Butterfly (1996)), as the beautiful and smart manager of LANDS.\n\nThe cinematography is on-and-off, employing the Iwai-inspired hand-held style which is both effective and annoying. This style of camera-work can either bring extreme originality or make the film appear amateurish. For example, in a few scenes the camera is far too unstable, mostly noticeable towards the beginning, making for an uncomfortable viewing experience (thankfully, these scenes are low in quantity). In other scenes, the camera works well, particularly when filming during performances or when the intimacy that the hand-held camera can bring is needed. I found myself enjoying the cinematography more as the film progressed. Cinematographer Onomichi Koji seems to be Iwai&apos;s new go-to cameraman after the death of his friend Shinoda Noboru, as he is using him here and in his next directorial feature, the English-language Vampire (2011).\n\nSince BANDAGE is a film about music, the songs must be good–and they are. Akanishi&apos;s voice is well-suited to the neo-rock/alternative sound and is pleasing overall. The songs are all original compositions by Kobayashi, who usually produces soundtracks for Iwai&apos;s films (unless he does it himself). The tracks are great, which helps raise the enjoyment scale of the movie. There is a particular scene in the film that gave me goosebumps: Yuichi is playing around with a recording of one of LANDS&apos;s songs in darkness, hair in his face. He alters the voice to be robotic-sounding and plays the guitar with a violin bow. It&apos;s a powerful and dark moment in the film in which we discover the extent of Yukiya&apos;s talent and his deep loneliness.\n\nBANDAGE is ultimately a film about self-discovery. It is effective in portraying the life of an indie band in 1990′s Japan, when the rise and fall of these bands was commonplace due to TV talent shows. With a strong cast, great music, and effective camera-work for the genre, BANDAGE manages to entertain while being an interesting commentary on the music industry at the time. Recommended!",

Kind of a new idea for the time, today you wouldn&apos;t waste your time.  Most memorable scene (perhaps the only one I can remember) two women lie in the sun in a secluded field and rub oil on each other after doffing their swimsuits.  The camera more or less just stares at them.  I dont even recall dialog - just narration.  Must have cost at least $23.89 to produce.  Still, it was an enjoyable experience for a young college student ...",

Simon Yam is listed as the star of this movie, but it really is Andy On. He has developed into a genuinely skilled martial artist with a tough guy attitude and he has plenty of scenes in this movie to show it off. Nicky Li does the choreography, which is aggressive, hard-hitting, violent, and requires athleticism to pull off. Li also did Invisible Target and Legendary Assassin (both Wu Jing vehicles); picture Wu Jing&apos;s speed combined with Tony Jaa&apos;s visceral power and that&apos;s the kind of fighting you get to see Andy On do here. His fight against Ken Lo in an empty dojo is particularly outstanding.\n\nExcept...the film itself sucks, and sucks bad. I can&apos;t explain why it&apos;s so terrible without spoiling it, but I will say that the second half feels more like a horror movie more than an action thriller. There are movies with heavy darkness and grittiness to them that can be compelling (see: Dog Bite Dog) but this movie will instead make you crack up repeatedly at its ridiculously bad script and predictable storyline.\n\nIn fact, I wanted to laugh at how bad it was, but I was too busy being mad at how bad it was, if that makes any sense.\n\nOh, did I mention that Andy On is ridiculously badass?",

      "reviewBody": "First off, I saw the Italian version of Pinocchio, subtitled in English. After watching the Italian version on DVD, we decided to switch to the English-language track to hear what it sounded like. It was like fingernails on a chalkboard...As unprofessional as watching a dubbed Godzilla movie.\n\n     Anyway, after hearing all the incredibly negative press about this film, I&apos;m not sure why we rented it. But when my family got a free rental, we decided to choose a movie that we wouldn&apos;t actually pay money for...and we chose Pinocchio. First of all, the movie is certainly not an excellent, 5 star affair. But it is a decent film that entertained the three of us for close to two hours.      Strong Points- Technically speaking, the film is beautifully made with beautiful sets, cinematography and scenery. These are not enough to entertain anybody but the most pompous film critic of course. The best part of the film for me, was the very faithful adaptation of the original classic story (foolish American audiences may say too dark...and yes, I am an American). It brought back fond memories for  all of us, of the original story we had enjoyed as children. And Kim Rossi Stuart as the doomed Lucignolo (not Leonardo) is charming.      Weak Points- Well, as many commenters have noted, Roberto Benigni is simply miscast in the role of Pinocchio and the sight of a 50-year old man playing a little boy does get annoying. But even so, he&apos;s not half as bad as they say he is.      All in all, it&apos;s an entertaining, if average, film as long as you have the brain cells to read the subtitles. Just a quick trivia note....one of the reasons the English dubbing is so bad (in my opinion) is that it was incredibly rushed. Benigni was supposed to dub his own voice, but dropped out at the last minute and was replaced my Breckin Meyer. By this time, the US release date was fast approaching, the film was directed at a childrens audience and the studio felt it couldnt release a childrens movie with subtitles.    *** 1/4 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "In this tv drama, a group of men band together to avoid arrest. It&apos;s a case of strength in numbers when a white farmer gets shot while bullying a black worker. In the deep South, the man who shot in self-defense would probably get the death penalty, so instead, while he hides, all the other workers pass the word among their families to bring their shotguns and gather at Louis Gossett Jr.&apos;s house (where the dead body lays). One by one, they all claim &quot;I&apos;m Spartacus&quot; in front of the sheriff, Richard Widmark. Ironically, Woody Strode is one of the faux confessors, and he was in Spartacus thirty years earlier. They&apos;re joined by Holly Hunter, who also claims she shot the man to protect the men who&apos;ve been working her family&apos;s farm for generations.\n\nSince we know he was a passionate civil rights activist in real life, and we know he got tired of being portrayed as the opposite on the screen, I don&apos;t know why Richard Widmark would take his role. All he does is portray a one-dimensional bigot who slaps black men while questioning them. I wouldn&apos;t really recommend this movie unless you love Holly Hunter. If your feelings are any less potent, she&apos;ll grate on your nerves from start to finish. I understand the moral of the story, but it probably would have made a better 20-minute short than a 90-minute feature.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the first I have seen of Tom Tykwer&apos;s work.   In a word, outstanding.  This movie has all the necessary elements for a successful production and ensures a completely entertaining evening.   The opening (and what an opening!) sets the mood..... A chilly landscape of deep snow with helicopter shots racing across treetops heavily weighed down with a recent fall.....And the music with its tremulous monotone suggests impending drama. I wait expectantly.....\n\nInto the picture comes Rene.  At first glance an odd-looking guy who suffers from a kind of amnesia.   He knows his name and where he lives but can&apos;t remember anything else.  That&apos;s why he photographs every little incident to jog his memory.  Laura who works as a hospital nurse agrees he&apos;s a bit weird but is fascinated just the same.  You get the feeling he&apos;s up to something.\n\nHer friend Rebecca, an attractive blond who works as a translator is having trouble with her boy friend Marco.  He&apos;s so possessive.  They congregate in Laura&apos;s house where much of the dialogue takes place.  Rebecca and Marco are continually arguing, falling in and out of love. These scenes are exceptional.\n\nIn some strange coincidence these four characters are in one way or another involved in the aftermath of a serious accident involving two cars swerving on the slippery highway.   In one of the cars a farmer who is taking his horse float to the vet. is knocked unconscious.  Later he is unable to convince the police that a second car was involved.  So he sets out on a mission to find the other car and the man responsible for the death of his daughter who died in hospital as a result of the accident.\n\nMarco the skiing instructor has an eye for the girls and there are some exciting scenes on the ski slopes as they engage the treacherous terrain. It&apos;s a matter of &quot;Hold tight!&quot; as the skiers disappear into the foggy atmosphere.\n\nThe snow bound landscape is for me a most unusual setting for the drama and I enjoyed every exciting minute.  The ending left me almost open-mouthed! And I&apos;m not telling!",

      "reviewBody": "I used to favor Minnelli&apos;s version over Renoir&apos;s .Not anymore .The only thing which works better in the American version is the actress.Jennifer Jones is par excellence the romantic heroine ,the passionate dreamer and she&apos;s beautiful.Valentine Tessier,Renoir&apos;s lead is not attractive at all and I would go as far as to write she makes a nice pair with her unfortunate hubby (Pierre Renoir,excellent).Artistically,Tessier has moments of great acting,notably the scene in front of the church with the priest where she gives a very modern portrayal -she looks as if she &apos;s in search of a shrink-.But physically she cannot be a romantic tragic dreamer.And, most of the time,she seems to be on a stage.\n\nBut all that surrounds Tessier is much better than Minelli&apos;s too hollywoodian adaptation.Only a French director can feel the atmosphere of a small town of Normandy,only a French director can recreate the moist landscapes of the land of the apple trees,only a French director can recreate an agriculture meeting with its awards: the scene where an old lady is awarded a medal after 54 (!) years of hard labor on the farms (a decoration which she intends to give to the vicar who in turn will celebrate a mass for her) represents all the poverty of the world and time :it&apos;s in Flaubert&apos;s book and Renoir at this stage of his career -he was at his most anarchist ,see &quot;la Chienne&quot; and &quot;Boudu&quot;- had to include it in his film.\n\nRenoir ,better than Minnelli,understood this hatred Emma felt for the provinces.Born on a farm,she dreamed away her childhood and adolescence.Neither Minnelli,nor Renoir have depicted the wedding and it is a pity : this vulgar country celebration with its rude peasants epitomizes all that Emma despises,she who is still dreaming of a Prince Charming who will take her away.And when the Prince appears (Her lover Rodolphe Boulanger) he will betray her.\n\nThe scene of the ball in an aristocratic castle is the pivot of both the novel and the film:afterward ,Emma will never be the same.Had she inherited from some distant relative,she would have been saved .But living shut away in her own small town,in the company of a meek less-than-handsome man and some petit bourgeois such as Homais ,her only hope is to be carried off by her lover....\n\nBut her lover ,Rodolphe Boulanger,is a wealthy selfish buck:the scene in the luxury house ,where Emma begs 8,000 Francs is similar in the two versions ,although in that one,Minnelli has the upper hand ,cause his actors (Jones and Louis Jourdan) are more convincing.\n\nChabrol&apos;s work starring Isabelle Huppert is eminently forgettable."

      "reviewBody": "French director Yves Robert [1920-2002] has excelled not only as an actor but also a filmmaker who made intelligent comedy films. This is what makes him worthy of a very special status in the history of French cinema. After having directed several successful films based on famous books, it was in 1970s that he presented a fresh perspective to French comedy films by inventing what can be termed as a &quot;Buddy Movie&quot; genre. It focused more on the &quot;sentimental misfortunes&quot; of a group of men who are friends with each other and have blown 40 candles of their birthday cakes. In the second film of this genre called &quot;We Will All Meet in Paradise&quot;, Yves Robert popped up a key question: How can some 40 years old men make time for themselves especially for offhand dalliances when they have children and wives at home ? The answer to his essential question is found in this film which is a good way to learn about the manner in which a homosexual person and masculine as well as feminine infidelities are treated by French people.Apart from dialogs and screenplay written by veteran screenwriter Jean-Loup Dabadie, Jean Rochefort,Victor Lanoux, Claude Brasseur and Guy Bedos shine as the film&apos;s real stars as they do their bit to enhance the value of their roles.Lastly,Josiane Balasko too has a minor role which has its own importance.",

      "reviewBody": "Made by one of the makers of Mondo Cane this is a biting attack of not only his partners, but also on the genre itself.\n\nThe film begins as a film maker and his party end up stranded in the desert. All seems lost and everyone begins to show sign of dehydration. Ghoulishly the film maker begins to film everyone&apos;s last moments, or not because its discovered that the stranding was staged to get footage for the next mondo film. From that point on the film becomes a world trek as the film maker pursues a girl and attempts to get the next great sequence. It all ends in Viet Nam during the height of the war.\n\nIts not hard to guess that the film is a nasty jab by director Paolo Cavara at his Mondo Cane co-directors, who had just run into trouble about a killing that appears in their Africa Addio, since much of the film is a quest to film some one die on camera. \n\nUltimately this film is a mixed bag. While I have no doubt that much of what is shown is the way things were done, it often comes across as the pot calling the kettle black with mondo-esque sequences appearing within the fictional frame work. While I honest believe that Cavara disavows his Mondo days, I think he would also love the success that his former friends briefly met as kings of the Mondo world. \n\nReservations aside this is a very good movie in its own right and should you come across it you should see it, especially if you&apos;ve ever watched a Mondo movie and wondered how it was done.",

      "reviewBody": "The title of this very low budget Egypt/US co-production suggests a melding of the mummy movie with the zombie movie that was extremely popular around the time of the film&apos;s release. Dawn Of The Mummy only partially fulfills this expectation. After a gory flashback opening to ancient Egypt and a somewhat amusing scene where people stagger out of the mummy&apos;s tomb with gored-out faces {and who exactly committed this dastardly act is left unexplained,because the mummy has yet to be awoken},very little happens for nearly an hour. The dialog and acting is pretty poor and it&apos;s obvious that much of is to to pad out the running time,although there is a little bit of tension at times.\n\nThen at last the mummy and his zombie followers are awoken and it&apos;s mayhem typical of Italian horror potboilers of the early 80s-eye gougings,flesh eating,etc,although nothing that would probably shock today&apos;s viewer. The mummy,who looks a lot like the one Christopher Lee played,seems to show up all over the place so much that one wonders if he teleports himself,and the film&apos;s geography is really screwy. Still,there is a little bit of {intentional} humour,such as somebody asking why do some clothes on a market stall possess Made In Hong Kong stickers, and the climactic bloody rampage through a village is well staged,after which the film abruptly stops,as it they ran out of film.\n\nDirector Frank Agrama doesn&apos;t show much skill and fails to make the most of some scenes,like the zombies rising out of the sand as the sun sets-just think how good some other directors of zombie movies like Lucio Fulci would have made this scene. Dawn of the Mummy is not a very good film,even on a fun trash level,and it really show how good something such as Fulci&apos;s Zombie really is. Still,there is some fun to be had....if you&apos;re patient."

      "reviewBody": "As is almost always the case with the films of Berlanga, this film is a comedy on the surface, which hides a very hard and crude criticism of the situation of Spanish society during the dictatorship. In those years, Spanish filmmakers couldn&apos;t speak freely and openly about the dismal state of their country, so they had to pass their message to the audience between the lines. Berlanga was a master at doing this, and Plácido is one of his finest examples. The abysmal differences that existed between the very poor (the majority of the population at the time) and the very rich, who treated the rest with utter contempt and ridiculous condescency, is portrayed with such strength that it can&apos;t leave anyone indifferent. But it is done in the form of a comedy, and a very funny one, full of absurd situations and memorable dialogues, but also a very black one, with some scenes, especially near the end of the movie, which are on the edge of the truly macabre. A true masterpiece from one of the greatest Spanish directors.",

I can say that after following the stories of these 5 friends in Moscow I have a deep sense of human connection and respect for people who was dramatically affected in the process that Russia held around the 90s. I have an understanding of what Perestroika meant for them.\n\nParallels between how these characters grew up and how their children are growing up nowadays allow audiences to perceive the contrast between communism and capitalism. This humanist film is a refined documentary full of cinematographic details and relevant opinions about an important historic issue.",

Definitely worth the watch if you&apos;re in the mood for a slow, sublime, and funny film that rewards you tenfold. \n\nSchultze is a quiet man, recently retired, who suddenly discovers the beauty of zydeco music. It has the feeling invoked by films such as &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, &quot;Broken Flowers&quot;, with it&apos;s characters that pass in and out of the protagonist&apos;s life, living in their own world, yet wanting to be part of something bigger. Schultze takes that leap of faith in the simple way of pursuing the music that has finally touched his soul.\n\nSome people might find it much too slow. The camera lingers on many long shots of subtle hilarity, emphasizing the humor in the sometimes mundane existence people experience.\n\nOne of the better films I&apos;ve seen in a while.",

      "reviewBody": "After surviving a car crash, real estate developer Dan Merrick (Tom Berenger) finds himself with Amnesia and begins to begin rebuilding his life with the help of his wife Judith (Greta Scacchi). As Dan examines the pieces of a life he can no longer remember and people he no longer knows his path crosses private investigator Gus Klein (Bob Hoskins) who reveals Dan&apos;s life may hide darker secrets.\n\nPart of a wave of films in the 90s that tired to be updates on Hitchcockian suspense thrillers (Final Analysis, A Perfect Murder, etc.), Shattered was released to middling reviews and lackluster box office most likely due in no small part to having the misfortune of being released less than two months after very similar (and much more financially successful) Dead Again. And while Dead Again is objectively a stronger film on the whole, Shattered still deserves credit for being a smart thriller with engaging performances and a genuine sense of style and suspense.\n\nBerenger is quite good as Dan Merrick and makes for a convincing everyman who tries to determine who can and cannot be trusted as he tries to piece together a mystery whose clues he can&apos;t seem to make sense of. Greta Scacchi is equally good as Dan&apos;s wife Judith and does a great job serving as a Hitchcock type enigma. But easily the best performance is Bob Hoskins as Private Investigator Gus Klein, a cynical, misanthropic, animal lover who commands the screen every time he&apos;s on camera.\n\nThe narrative is solid in terms of it&apos;s structure and Wolfgang Petersen&apos;s direction and writing effortlessly come together to create the needed amount of intrigue and engagement expected in a film of this ilk. Throughout the first half of the movie we (the audience) are very much in Dan&apos;s shoes following down every lead as he finds them with answers leading to more questions. To say anymore would be to spoil the movie, the ending it builds up to is suitably twisty and surprising but whether it strains credibility will be dependent on the person who watches it.\n\nShattered is a well made thriller with good performances and an intrigue rich hook. The film for the most part successfully emulates all the tricks and trappings familiar to Hitchcock&apos;s films and while it doesn&apos;t quite stick the landing for its ending (at least for me personally), it is still a solid thriller that&apos;ll keep you engaged til the end.",

      "reviewBody": "The pretty standard stuff of elfish lore, where magical faerie folk protect the woods and the life enclosed inside. Led by the Queen Tara ( voiced in English-language version by Beyoncé Knowles) the minuscule forest inhabitants guard the essence of creation from the destructive appetite of the agents of blight - creatures called Boggans - and their malevolent leader, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz). These forces of good are led by the seasoned warrior Ronin (Colin Farrell), who together with his elven battalion mount hummingbird steeds. His special protégé is independent-minded brash Nod (Josh Hutcherson), who disregards structure and rules. However, each faerie Leafman must become a part of a bigger tree, in order for the forest to survive. Especially now, when a rare astronomical occurrence brings about the necessity to name a new queen, chosen through the use of a magical bud. This ceremony is disrupted by the onslaught of Mandrake&apos;s forces. Meanwhile a somewhat crazed and estranged Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) seeks proof of little green forest men residing in the woods, much to the distraught of his only daughter Mary Katherine (or as she prefers to be known M.K.) (Amanda Seyfried), who moves in grieving after the death of her mother.\n\nWhat can I say say? I love me some faeries and the magical allure of nature. Here &quot;Epic&quot; delivers with aplomb the visual feasts of an enchanted forest coupled with ages-old tales of combat between good and evil - or as portrayed here as a conflict between life and decay. The obvious flaw to be pointed out is the generic and predictable storyline, which delivers essentially what was to be expected, failing to really instill any sense of novelty. With some well-placed humour, thankfully low on the adult kind and more focused on family laughs, &quot;Epic&quot; does however deliver on its base promise: offering entertainment for both adults and children. Visually appeasing with some engaging story lines, apt for parents or simply for adults looking for a good time, are sure to be satisfied by the magical light-hearted tones, just perfect for disassociating yourselves from the mundanity of everyday life.\n\nSome fault can also be found in a somewhat underwhelming formation of characters, mostly feeling like poorly fleshed out cardboard cutouts with only the touching relationship between father and daughter really hitting home. Some of the secondary characters are just poorly conceived comedic relief (like the slug and the snail), while the overall story seems somewhat overloaded given the running time. Especially the character of Nod seems to be a missed concept, as he fails to have enough structure to really develop any relationship with either Ronin or M.K., thus adding a certain sense of superfluousity to his role in the movie. Nonetheless, the underlying weaknesses fail to prove detrimental from family viewing, making it a rewatchable feast for the eyes and imagination, without ever truly hitting classic animation territory.",

As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion.

The two twin actresses are stunning, Pierre Richard almost makes you believe he has a twin brother. The story is far from the best every written, but some scenes are just hilarious. It&apos;s a typical 80&apos;s french comedy, which far outmatches its US remake (Two much - 1995). It&apos;s probably one of the best movie with Pierre Richard where he doesn&apos;t play a clumsy character. The whole story is nothing but a dream, maybe silly at times, but it&apos;s definitely a feel-good type of movie. If you&apos;re a fan of Pierre Richard and still haven&apos;t watched this one, by all means go rent it somewhere. It&apos;s available on DVD.",

The camera work and the lighting are excellent. The plot is not predictable; there is actually a mystery going on here that kids and adults will enjoy. The kid actors are wonderful. There&apos;s even some cool music, including two renditions of Macho Man. Of course what would a teenage spy caper be without some crawling through the ducts, but that&apos;s forgivable. This is a great movie to share with your children. Nothing less than innocent here, don&apos;t worry. The most violence is a gun than never shoots and a guy falling a few feet off a ladder. Otherwise this is perfect entertainment for the entire family.",

The story line from Kesey&apos;s book, and the direction by Paul Newman are so closely woven and with such impact that there are times when one is left emotionally bare. There&apos;s not a fault in the casting,and the background of logging is nicely interwoven into the action bringing up surprise after surprise. The only flaw might be the glamorization of Lee Remick - I doubt that her character would show such a degree of grooming and cosmetic sophistication, but, as ever, Ms. Remick gives a performance that is impeccable. If awards were ever to come PaulNewman&apos;s way for direction and/or acting surely they should for this masterpiece."

      "name": "The classic Cold War spy thriller turned into a ravishing looking thinking man&apos;s thriller",
      "reviewBody": "I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness, but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of &apos;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&apos; is a masterful re-telling of John le Carré&apos;s seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley (played majestically by Gary Oldman) is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill (which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position) when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman&apos;s face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece; expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt (who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley) and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense, but which also acts as important plot points and clues.\n\nThe film is about the hunt for a Soviet &apos;mole&apos; in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6 but fictitiously known as &apos;The Circus&apos;) by George Smiley, an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer, a British agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam (Bendedict Cumberbatch) who is Tarr&apos;s handler, Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership, anyone of whom might be the mole, headed by Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) and his deputies Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) – the &apos;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&apos; of the book (codenames assigned by Control, Head of British Secret Service).\n\nThe director, Tomas Alfredson, established his reputation with &apos;Let the Right One In&apos;, an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too, is a film about human nature, moral dilemmas and relationships – friendship, loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like &apos;Let the Right One In&apos; Alfredson imbues &apos;Tinker, Tailor&apos;, Soldier, Spy&apos; (his first English language feature) with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient, but this is richly rewarded with scenes, shot after shot, that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming&apos;s vigorous secret agent. Indeed, Robert De Niro&apos;s admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency (CIA) in &apos;The Good Shepherd&apos; (2006) has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson – a &apos;grey man&apos; whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of &apos;Tinker, Tailor&apos; is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the &apos;grey man&apos; (note Smiley&apos;s grey hair, grey countenance and grey suit replete with over-sized glasses and shambling gait) of the secret intelligence service wins the day.\n\nThe screenwriters, Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O&apos;Connor, have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour potboiler without losing any of its exposition, characters, and plotting. John le Carré and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man&apos;s film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship, loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world. If the film does &apos;King&apos;s Speech&apos; levels of business I think it just might and Hollywood would be the richer for it."

      "reviewBody": "I often record films off TCM or other film channels and I&apos;ll nearly always record westerns. Often I don&apos;t get past the first few minutes but every now and then I come across a real classic. I wasn&apos;t aware of this film or its cult status when I watched it so I was able to form an opinion without a prior bias. \n\nFirstly I was impressed by the opening scene of Barbara Stanwyck and her forty horsemen thundering across the screen and richness of the black and white cinematography. The film itself immediately grabbed my interest and the dialogue was at times cheesy, at times full of sexual innuendo, but always interesting. It was only when it came to a scene where the Bonnell brothers are walking through Tombstone that I realised I was watching a single shot that went on and on and on. There&apos;s no merit in doing long tracking shots just for the hell of it but this was something that worked beautifully.\n\nThe composition of many shots and their realisation was quite magnificent and I would love to see this on a big screen now. One scene where a widow is shot from below and there is a long pan past the hearse to a singer under a tree and back again puts most modern music videos to shame. \n\nIt has to be said that this is also one of the silliest and campest films ever made with its emphasis, not to mention song, on a &quot;high riding woman with a whip&quot;. The general fondling of firearms and sexual references are so blatant that it seems surprising that this film wasn&apos;t universally condemned by the usual suspects on its release. \n\nI was also impressed by the cast who weren&apos;t what you might expect for a western. I especially liked Barry Sullivan&apos;s pre-Leone, pre-Eastwood portrayal of the gunslinger. \n\nAll in all a complete delight. I&apos;m looking forward to watching it again."

The flick is fully uncut watchable in Italian or English spoken. Parts that never had a English translation are left in in Italian with English subs. A thing that has been done before with Italian flicks.\n\nDon&apos;t think that this is going to be a classic giallo because it isn&apos;t. It even isn&apos;t a gory flick. More about possession. But not in the Exorcist (1973) tradition. Although it also centers around a child this has a more arty way of filming. \n\nBritish reporter Michael Williams (Richard Johnson) has lost his wife in a fire. He&apos;s left with his daughter Emily (Nicoletta Elmi). He&apos;s gone to Italy together with his daughter and nanny to make a documentary about art but Emily still has weird nightmares due the death of her mother. To make her at ease her father give her a medallion. But things go worse from here.\n\nThe medolic score also adds towards the atmosphere, piano and guitar doesn&apos;t give it a eerie feeling but still things are happening. The score sometimes do remind you of Morricone. The downfall for a lot of horror fans can lay in the fact that the possession takes a while to enter. It&apos;s a slow flick, nothing graphic to see. And it do takes until almost the end before the supernatural enters and even that is low. \n\nKudos to Nicoletta Elmi as an 11 year old she gives an excellent performance and was a common face back then in horrors. But she decided to quit in her mid 20s to become a doctor.\n\nIf you like flicks that are beautifully shot and has a eerie atmosphere then this is your stuff. \n\nGore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",

I do agree with both of the first reviewers for this in that it did have some promise, but it fell short. Perhaps because of the long delay before actual production of the project got under way when Ealing Studios saw it as an unusual product worth tackling.\n\nValentina Cortesa did a marvelous job as a foreign refugee living in London who gets caught up in the intrigue unwillingly.This film was one of the only ones that I hadn&apos;t seen of Audrey Hepburn&apos;s earlier works. Although she only appears in it off and on she is given a broader speaking role than her previous earlier film &apos;walk-on&apos; parts. She was quite able to act with the best of what this British Film Company had to offer, in a role a bit too understated for me. In fact, the whole film was a little too &apos;understated&apos;, dealing with a bomb plot planned by nationals of a foreign tyranny in 1930&apos;s London.\n\nI would watch this again, as it is now part of my library of hard to find films. I gave it an eight out of ten stars for Cortesa&apos;s performance and the early glimpse of Hepburn beyond a one minute spot.One does walk away from this film wishing it was better given it&apos;s premise, which is still very much a topic of today as it was then.If you can find a copy I would recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Like the Nightmare On Elm Street series before it, the Child&apos;s Play films have taken on a very humorous turn. What started out as a very straight forward horror film has over the past four sequels turned into a comedy with gore in it. That&apos;s not to say that Seed Of Chucky is a bad film by any means. It&apos;s actually really funny. While many compared New Nightmare to the Player for its blending of reality and fantasy, this film actually does it as well but manages to stick more to the satiric humour of The Player. There are Hollywood jokes galore and references to past films. Chucky&apos;s Ode to The Shining is pure hilarity and even Jennifer Tilly herself isn&apos;t safe as she manages to send up her own image more than even the rest of the cast around her. While Seed of Chucky is enjoyable for what it is, I can only hope that they decide to return the series to its terror roots if another is to be made.",

Most of them really get something good out of this mess. And this movie is no different. Staying mostly on one side, you still get to see &quot;the enemy&quot; and their points of view from time to time. It is superbly cut together and acted very fine.\n\nWhile I&apos;m not sure about how accurate the movie is by presenting the events (I&apos;m guessing it takes a few creative freedoms), it does not hold back when it comes to punches (or bullets for that matter). The lines between good and evil are really thin. You might argue there are none. The grey area is very big, that is one thing that is very true though. Not the best war movie to come out of Korea, it still is superior to a lot of other war movies.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Bad Channels&apos; is one of the worst SF/horror movies ever made. It&apos;s so boring and unfunny that you could almost think it was directed by Ted V. Mikels of &apos;Blood Orgy Of The She-Devils&apos; fame. In fact it was directed by Ted Nicolaou who previously made the useless &apos;TerrorVision&apos;. Now that was one lame so-called comedy, but this one is even worse. Getting through to the very end was a real chore even with the fast forward on the remote in constant use. The other guy responsible for this crud is Jackson Barr who also scripted &apos;Trancers 2&apos; (a.k.a. &apos;Future Cop 2&apos;). Now that wasn&apos;t the greatest movie ever made but at least it was entertaining. I don&apos;t know what went wrong here but it&apos;s really one to miss. Even a soundtrack by Seventies Rock Gods Blue Oyster Cult and some allegedly &quot;clever&quot; parodies of music videos (a generic 80s hair band, a grunge thing, and a sorta Mr. Bungle/Primus one) can&apos;t save this utter waste of time. Paul Hipp (an Abel Ferrara semi-regular) leads a mediocre cast, which includes former MTV Veejay Martha Quinn and various other nonentities, in a ridiculous tale of aliens taking over a radio station with the plan of capturing Earth women, shrinking them and placing them in bottles. Why are they doing this? Who knows. Who cares. There is ONE, count &apos;em, ONE laugh in this whole movie and that is a cameo by b-grade legend Tim Thomerson, and that doesn&apos;t even happen until AFTER the final credits. This movie stinks on ice. Avoid at all costs!"

When MacDonald is killed, Cjamango (George Ardisson) hunts down the murderers in a typical revenge story. Jack Smart (Peter Martell) drinks too much, doesn&apos;t live up to his name and is killed quickly. His older brother Dick (Anthony Ghidra) gets a lot of men together now and chases Cjamango. Barrica (Pedro Sanchez) knows that there is a price on the heads of most pursuers, so in exchange for the bounty money, he helps Cjamango. After the courteous exchange of various brutalities between Cjamango and the smarter Smart brother, Cjamango remembers a friend of his father owns a machine gun from the civil war. Guess what? The first 30 minutes are not very encouraging to watch the rest, especially since the camera work is a bit static, but as soon as Cjamango meets the main villains, the action becomes a bit more lively (or rather, deadly), and in the end you get a typical, violent genre movie, not more than average but not less either. Some locations are familiar from &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot;, by the way.",

When we first see the profoundly disabled people on the screen, we shy away from them, disturbed to consider that these creatures might be people like ourselves.  But through the love of the woman whose work Herzog captures here, we discover them as precisely what they -- and we -- are:  human brothers and sisters endowed by God with both the need for love and an unimpaired (despite physical handicaps) capacity to love.        Watching this movie some 20 years ago, I found this remarkable film one of the most exhilarating cinematic experiences of my life (and I&apos;m now 55 and a veteran of many, many movies, and this film retains its wondrous place in my memory), a testament to the unity of the universal human family told with the artist&apos;s -- Herzog&apos;s -- aesthetic objectivity, yet clearly giving voice to a passionate embrace and advocacy of life, no matter how physically disabled.",

The documentary commences with a juvenile lineup of petty criminals, apparently rounded up during a raid of the luxuriously unattractive &apos;Secondigliano&apos; complex which is just one of the reputed strongholds of &apos;la Camorra&apos; in Naples. Various academics, industrialists and students vent their opinions regarding the current state of Neapolitan affairs including crime, unemployment, drugs, politics and real estate. If you are unfamiliar with Naples, this documentary will provide a sense of a people coping with a difficult metropolitan crisis seemingly caused by corrupt government, poverty and the ensuing criminality associated with both.",

      "reviewBody": "American International made four low budget films starring Doug McClure based on books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the author of the Tarzan books.  THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT and it&apos;s sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT borrowed heavily from Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s THE LOST WORLD but added it&apos;s own twists and turns.  THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT is a non-stop adventure in the Indiana Jones mode with Major Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne, son of the Duke) out to rescue shipwrecked Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure from the first film).  Among those along for the adventure is Lady Charlotte Cunningham played by a beautiful Sarah Douglas (SUPERMAN II).  Despite Amelia Earhart attire she is definately hot.  She reminded me of Francesca Hunt in THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF JULES VERNE on the Sci-Fi Network.  Along the way they meet Ajor (Dana Gillespie) friend of Bowen Tyler, who looks and dresses like Xena, Warrior Princess (so this is where Xena got that look).  Dana Gillespie is stunning and like Xena and Sheena makes a great Jungle Girl (strong, smart, gorgeous, sexy...hey what else could one ask for?)  Lady Charlotte and Major Ben create a romantic tension but when Ajor enters the scene Major Ben has eyes for Ajor and Lady Charlotte just goes with the flow chumming up with Ajor as well.  I found that refreshing and glad to see the women in this film be more than just damsels in distress (there is a little of that toward the end but it all evens out with everyone being able to do something heroic). Jungle Girl films have been around for a long time (check out the serials!) and I truly love them because they show women to have strength, beauty, and brains.  This film is a worthy member of that genre.  Like the rest of the series the special effects are uneven but always entertaining (the vehicles and sets are always stunning but these guys never did know how to make a monster).  The violence is very very low key, the frights are made funny by rubber puppets, and there is no swearing.  Appropriate for the entire family for those into Xena and The Lost World."

The wife of one of them died. And Kuznetsov can not go on flying to space. So he returns to navy aviation. Very soon a serious trouble happens to spacecraft and Kuznetsov flies to space to help his best friend, who was trapped in the closed sector of the craft. As soon as he managed to do that- new troubles start -the meteorite wind hits the craft and they have no ability to go back. They have only 12 hours. Then their teacher decides to help his students and saves their lives in space. Very serious and unusual look at the space explorations and true to life situations, not that sci fi. Far more like space necro realism . The score by master of Russian electronic music Edward Artemeyev is perfect, especially in the end of the film it becomes really symphonic dark space ambient. Very rare to find exclusive flick.",

      "reviewBody": "Prolific actor Johannes Meyer established his later often repeated role as a grumpy man in this character study representing the best film from director George Schnéevoight. Actors in those days still tended to repeat their old exaggerated theater mannerisms, and the younger comedian Arhoff find it difficult to display his own talent for extreme mannerisms in the company of Meyer, and that suits us all just fine. This is a burlesque comedy of the rough nature you could still get away with in the Thirties, and there are some hilarious scenes connected to simpleminded musical interludes. There are other farces in this genre, but none pulled off in such an impressive manner. It took some decades before the industry reinvented the genre in black comedies. Axel Frische was in on the manuscript, and he executed many effective farces and comedies of the day.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Peter Pan&apos; is undoubtedly one of the best of Disney&apos;s films. The story isn&apos;t too deep or meaningful, as, say, &apos;Bambi&apos;. The power behind it is the familiarity. Every little kid yearns to haveadventures like Peter, so everyone identifies with the story. To tell the truth, the film is kind of episodic, like an extra-large TV cartoon special. The climax is fittingly climactic, but the final defeat of Hook isn&apos;t really powerful enough, which makes it disappointing after all the flashy swordplay. Speaking of Hook, he and Mr Smee are inevitably the scene-stealers, no matter how beloved Peter may be to children. The same way, in Hook/Smee scenes, if you throw in a hungry crocodile, the monstrous reptile will overshadow even Hook. Wendy really looks too old to be horrified about growing up, though, except for the sequences in which she fantasizes about Never Land with all the authenticity of a three-year-old. Never Land is beautiful, to say the least. The lush jungles and the mermaid lagoon is wonderfully brought to life, as is the eery Skull Island. This is the best showcase for the art direction. Also excellent is the detailed, meticulous design of the wooden hideout of the Lost Boys.\n\n&apos;Peter Pan&apos; is one of my all-time favorites. It has humor, great animation, and the best part of it is a simplistic story that revolves around the desires of the child within all of us (I&apos;m still twelve, so I never had to look too deep). A must-see for any animation fan, particularly Disney buffs, the young and the young-at-heart.\n\n9/10"

Common slapstick and farce driven movies tend to be negative targets for critics, but this one is ultimately at the top of its list for the category. Im talking about Bio-Dome. A strangely amusing movie about two stoners dealing with the environment (great combination).\n\nIdiot collegians, Bud Macintosh (Pauly Shore) and Doyle Johnson (Stephen Baldwin). Residing in Arizona, the duo are in hot water with their girlfriends, Monique (Joey Lauren Adams) and Jen (Teresa Hill) after a desperate excuse to get out of helping the environment on Earth Day. The duo prove they can by venturing across Arizona in which they become locked inside a Bio-Dome, in which they mistake for a mall.\n\nThe duo are unable to leave the dome seeing as the workers must remain in their for exactly a year. If contracted with &quot;outside air&quot; the experiment will be ruined. Naturally, the duo are carefree and decide to screw around in the enclosed case as if it&apos;s their prime home. The workers get aggravated, and try to cope with the duo. But they are so irresponsible and unreliable it&apos;s and unbelievable frustration.\n\nAs much as I heard Luke warm to abysmal reviews, I just had to watch it and give my honest opinion about it. I actually tolerated the entire thing. To my knowledge, this was originally set to be the third Bill and Ted film in the franchise. We can call this the scrapped Bill and Ted, or the Bill and Ted spin off. Regardless, it&apos;s a fun, rulefree movie, that shouldn&apos;t be taken seriously. As well as being just a fun movie, with good ol&apos; stoner humor. Pre-Half Baked.\n\nStarring: Pauly Shore, Stephen Baldwin, William Atherton, Joey, Lauren Adams, and Kylie Minogue. Directed by: Jason Bloom.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve not seen a lot of peplum, but this has surely got to be one of the weirdest. The film starts in Scotland in the year 1550 where witch Martha Gaunt is sentenced to be burned at the stake by Justice Edgar Parrish (Andrea Bosic), who was spurned by the woman when she was young and beautiful. Before she dies, Martha places a curse on the land.\n\n100 years later and the curse is in full effect, local women succumbing to madness and suicide, a gnarled tree sprouting a flower with each death. After newlyweds Martha (Vira Silenti ) and Charley (Angelo Zanolli) move into the local castle, the village folk get wind of the fact that Martha&apos;s maiden name was Gaunt, and decide that she is the reincarnation of the witch and must also be burnt at the stake.\n\nSo far, so fairly normal, but then things get totally bonkers\n\nOut of nowhere, Maciste (Kirk Morris)—a muscleman wearing nothing but a loincloth—rides his horse into town to try and prevent the execution. Pushing the tree over, he leaps into the hole underneath and enters Hell, where he faces many challenges before confronting the witch, the only one who can break the curse.\n\nFirst Maciste wrestles a lion (a drugged-up real lion for long shots and a really manky stuffed lion head for close ups); then he wanders past the tortured and the damned where he helps Sisyphus to push his giant boulder. A massive flaming door is opened using a pair of rocks, although Maciste burns his hands in the process. Next, he narrowly escapes a booby trapped tunnel with a spiked roof that slowly lowers. A beautiful woman, Fania, heals his hands. Maciste is attacked by snakes, and a troglodyte, Goliath, who wrestles with our hero when he rushes to Fania&apos;s rescue. Having defeated Goliath, Maciste uses a boulder to shield himself from hot sparks, and has a chat with Prometheus, who is condemned to have eagles peck at his innards for all eternity, learning that he has been put under a spell by Fania, who is really Martha the witch.\n\nAfter clearing his mind by watching some clips from his other movies in a pool of water (the one with the cyclops looks like good schlocky fun), and steering a herd of stampeding cattle off the edge of a cliff, Maciste finally breaks Martha&apos;s curse by kissing her. On the surface, a rainstorm puts out the fire about to burn Martha and Charley, the locals seeing this as a sign of their prisoners&apos; innocence. Meanwhile, Maciste ascends from hell, mounts his steed, and rides off to help some other poor people in need.\n\nEven with its constant barrage of bizarreness, I found Maciste in Hell a bit of a bore, the action consisting of Morris unconvincingly straining as he lifts supposedly heavy prop boulders or wrestles with stuffed or doped-up animals. Stunning location work (the scenes of hell were shot in the picturesque caves of Castellana) and great lighting ensures that the film is aesthetically pleasing, but director Riccardo Freda fails to bring much life to proceedings, making the film strictly for the most avid of sword and sandal fans, or those just wanting to see something completely random.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was almost hooted into oblivion by the critics at the time of its release, so when I saw it on one of the Cinemax channels last night, I was surprised that it wasn&apos;t much worse. A few months ago I saw the highly acclaimed docudrama on Fidel on Showtime, and this film, while not as good as the Showtime drama, is not all that much worse either.\n\nFirst the bad stuff. Jack Palance&apos;s portrayal of Fidel Castro must rank as one of the worst performances ever to appear on screen. During the first half of the film, he spends most of the time rolling a lit cigar around in his mouth and making weird facial grimaces, most of which he seems to have forgotten by the second half. Moreover, he makes Castro come across as a dim-witted doofus who is always helped to see the right course by the brilliant Che, rather than portraying Castro as the brilliant strategist and tactician he was. Secondly, although the film is in English, much of the spoken dialogue sounds like a dubbed movie. Maybe that&apos;s because one of the principal supporting actors is Italian.\n\nThat having been said, the film&apos;s history is, quite surprisingly, fairly accurate. It accurately depicts how Castro&apos;s forces were almost completely wiped out after the arrival from Mexico, and Castro was left with a force numbering less than twenty. Nevertheless, he survives and gradually wins the support of the peasants, so that eventually he has a guerrilla force numbering in the thousands. The fact that Guevara was unable to pull off the same feat in Bolivia, due largely to his own megalomania that prevented his listening to the Bolivian peasants, is accurately portrayed as well. This isn&apos;t available on video and isn&apos;t likely to come to a theater, so you can probably see it only on cable. If it comes along, it&apos;s worth a watch.",

Josh Gad is throwing everything at this and it feels very common. Almost everything seems flat in this one. The poop joke is so common that I actually got bored. It&apos;s not shocking anymore. The only truly fun scene for me is the boys competing against the teams of girls in the wet T-shirts. It allows the three guys to play off each other better in something a little different. Too bad, it&apos;s only one scene in a whole movie of been-there and done-that sex-romp.",

I swear, half of these reviews I&apos;m reading are annoying - people bashing it because it&apos;s an all black movie, people bashing it because the band has dancers instead of a color guard, people calling the drumming rudimentary because they played in a drumline that did better blah blah blah.\n\nWhat do you guys want, a documentary on marching band?  If I was to make a Hollywood movie about the drumline I would have done the same exact things with the drum sequences - put in a gang of stick tricks and showmanship that would translate well to the screen.  Nobody wants to watch flam taps for 90 minutes.\n\nThat being said, the last drum battle is one of my favorite things to watch. I love when the bass drum cadence comes in, the basses march in a circle, the quads toss each other their sticks between bars, and the snares have an orgy of backsticking and other stick tricks on a level you rarely see performed in real life.  And the movie is only cliche as far as its kid w/ bad attitude needs to put his pride away plot goes.  I don&apos;t watch Nickelodeon so I haven&apos;t seen one of those types of movies since I was... hmmm since I was 5.  Far as what isn&apos;t cliche about it, there&apos;s a lot to like.  One of the best things is that it immerses itself in Afro-American culture w/out any cliches at all - just life as it is down south at an all-black university.  No guns, drugs, none of that stuff that you&apos;d expect from a character who walks and talks like Nick Cannon&apos;s character does. I also liked the way they handled the white character in the band.  The dialogue where they ask him why he went to the all-black college.  His first reply is a wink at the audience, which would expect Hollywood to trivialize race relations like that.  Then he goes, nah for real though, and gives a sincere answer that makes sense."

When I saw it on initial release, I liked it fine, but thought it would be memorable mainly for particular bits--the very funny scene with the obnoxious yuppie flat owner, the very powerful scenes with Mark Benton as Ricky--rather than for any coherence.  I saw it again this week and it is sticking in my mind with more impact than before; to me it now resonates as a meditation on the need to get on with one&apos;s life, and the costs (in friendship, soulfulness, caring) of doing so, and the tragedy of those who just can&apos;t make the jump. Not one of Leigh&apos;s greatest films, but like everything he&apos;s made, well worth the time.",

It is not a prerogative of the English to keep up appearances. Maybe it is just my weird sense of humour. There are few things as funny as people trying the best they can to run everything smoothly and perfectly, just because decencey commands it, and failing. Altman mercilessly shows the inevitable result: hypocrisy. This is what happens, when people deny human shortcomings. That&apos;s why I think A wedding is not typical a 70&apos;s movie, but has enduring qualities. Compared to Gosford Park it is easy to follow all the subplots. I like A wedding even better than Mash.",

He embarks upon a career as a serial murderer in which his intended victims are ravishing looking females but Fate continually thwarts his lethal intentions and his murders never get past the fantasy stage.\n\nThe most notorious scene in the film and one of which only this director is capable, is where Archibaldo consigns to the flames of a kiln a wax model of one of his potential victims who has slipped through his grasp. This macabre episode has acquired a tragically ironic overtone as the woman who has modelled for the dummy is played by Miroslava Stern who was cremated shortly after filming completed, having taken her own life. Bunuel was of course to employ a &apos;prosthetic limb&apos; to great effect in &apos;Tristana&apos;.\n\nWorking within the budgetary limitations of Mexican cinema, director Luis Bunuel has fashioned a stylish, sophisticated and technically polished piece that contains some delicious performances and bizarre Bunuelian moments that linger long in the memory.\n\nAlthough condemned by circumstances to being innocent of murder Archibaldo still feels the need to &apos;confess&apos; to the police. He is politely dismissed by a detective with the words:&quot;thinking about murdering someone does not constitute a crime.&quot; This will strike a chord with most of us I am sure!",

      "reviewBody": "That should just about sum it up, but I&apos;ll continue. There were about 3 things about Susan Cooper&apos;s magnificent book that were preserved in this movie: a couple of names (but certainly not all of them--where was the difficulty in letting his father be named &quot;Roger&quot; rather than changing it to &quot;John&quot;??), a rook feather in the snow, and... that&apos;s about it. Sorry, couldn&apos;t think of a third. From the color of the Rider&apos;s horse to the number (AND AGE) of Will&apos;s siblings, from the abilities of the Old Ones (Swords and crossbows? Really?) to the utter importance of the Walker (I wanted to scream)... nothing nothing nothing was safe from being altered, disregarded, obliterated, and out-and-out ignored. I wasted $7.50, but had to be sure that it was as awful as I feared. It was worse. The last time a superb book-turned-rubbish-movie angered me this much was when I was forced to see Jim Carrey prance around as Count Olaf, who should&apos;ve been one of the greatest villains to scare the wits out of little kids everywhere.\n\nI&apos;d like to say I&apos;m done with adaptations, but The Golden Compass is coming out, and that one looks like more than the gaffer actually read the bloody book.",

I have seen more mutated animal movies than I can remember and this is better than most. The acting is good and the shrews don&apos;t look too bad. I mean they are just dogs with throw rugs on their backs and some fake teeth but they only attack at night(BRILLIANT!)and they move very fast so you can&apos;t see them very well anyway. The movie starts with two guys on a ship going to an island and knowing a hurricane is coming. When they get there, the captain is immediately and obviously suspicious. Other than the scientists making up a bunch of lies and having guns, there&apos;s not much of the usual giant mutated animal movie clichés. One thing you might consider a flaw is that ten minutes in, you will know who is going to die. I actually like that. This was the first time I correctly picked every character who would die. This is definitely worth seeing.",

As an early-1970s Hollywood Lothario who first gained recognition on TV&apos;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot; as the resident heartthrob, and later parlayed that same appeal in the hit romantic-tragedy &quot;Love Story&quot;, it is amazing that actor Ryan O&apos;Neal was then typecast as a befuddled square who is nervous and unsure around women (this following his success in 1972&apos;s &quot;What&apos;s Up, Doc?&quot;). O&apos;Neal doesn&apos;t really fit the role; his clumsiness isn&apos;t forced, yet the star doesn&apos;t have the innate grace for physical comedy (he&apos;s too self-conscious and heavy-spirited, and mock-innocent). The film has one great gag (split jeans), and a funny follow-up (a TV commercial promoting the jeans with see-through plastic on the rear), but none of the screwball hijinks in the boudoir raises a laugh. *1/2 from ****",

First there are the responsibilities to her young sons who are still recovering from the loss of their father something that is being constantly pointed out by her shrew of a mother, the great Lucile Watson. At first she seems resigned to basically being a professional widow sacrificing any life of her own for her duties and then suddenly George Brent enters the picture and she starts to realize that perhaps there might be a chance for something of her own again, an idea supported by her good friend Eve Arden but then her judgmental mother and false friends make her question her right to happiness.

      "reviewBody": "Colonel Munro&apos;s (Hugh Buckler) 2 daughters, Alice (Binnie Barnes) and Cora (Heather Angel) are led to the fort where their father is fighting for the British against the French. During the journey, a Huron Indian scout, Magua (Bruce Cabot) leads Alice, Cora and Major Heyward (Henry Wilcoxon) through a short cut but it is a trap. An American frontiersman, Hawkeye (Randolph Scott) and two Mohican Indians, Chingachgook (Robert Barrat) and Uncas (Phillip Reed) rescue the party and deliver them safely to Colonel Munro. However, the girls are then captured and taken to the Huron tribe and it is up to Hawkeye, the Major and the two Mohicans to rescue them from their fates as determined by the Huron leader.\n\nI have seen the recent re-make of this film and I wanted to like this film better. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t. It&apos;s still a good film - it&apos;s just not as engrossing. The relationships between the characters are not as deeply portrayed and poignant moments are not dwelt upon to give the film as much depth as occurs in the re-make, eg, the love between Uncas and Cora. The character of Magua is also far more scary in the re-make although I prefer Randolph Scott&apos;s &quot;Hawkeye&quot; to the extremely wooden Daniel Day Lewis. Speaking of wooden, the two Mohicans are exactly that. Their &quot;me Tarzan, you Jane&quot; style of dialogue is laughably bad and reminiscent of Daniel Day Lewis&apos;s attempts in the re-make.\n\nA couple of other moments weren&apos;t as good as the re-make. In that film, the story ends with the line &quot;......Last of the Mohicans&quot; - a far more poignant ending to the film.\n\nThere are good moments, eg, the canoe chase and the sparring between the Major and Hawkeye, and it&apos;s still an engaging film. But the re-make is better on many levels, including, scenery, music, and romantic development",

      "reviewBody": "Director Kurt Hoffmann already made a film adaptation of Curt Goetz&apos; play in 1953 with Goetz himself in the lead (qv). The script of this adaptation is more elaborated, that is: it shows the events before the trial starts. The set-up of the film is remarkable: the set-design is very unrealistic: there are no real walls or streets etc, the grass is definitely out of plastic, everything is artificial; the main colour in this colour film is white. In this way Hoffmann tries to set the mood of the play - romantic humanity and human dignity - against that of a rational environment.\n\nThe idea of the set-design is fine and the design is beautifully executed (and photographed), however in the end Hoffmann does not really combines this with the play; it remains an idea. The play is still there in its almost original form and long dialogues; either the writers or Hoffmann were/was able to make the design an intrinsic part of the play, that should have been almost re-written to achieve this.\n\nStill with Heinz Rühmann and Liselotte Pulver in the lead this still is a very enjoyable film, though with his first adaptation Hoffmann made a better film.",

From dawn to late night, the film shows various people and their occupation, as well as local landmarks. It is fascinating to see how urban life was during those years (circa 1960), and it helps minimize local poverty if compared to other countries.\n\nThere is no story told, but what makes the structure of À Saint-Henri le cinq septembre is the narrator&apos;s commentary on various social issues. It sometimes makes the people&apos;s condition look more special than it was.\n\nWhile its purpose is to give a meaning to common things, the commentary seems more adapted for Saint-Henri as it was before World War II, and as depicted in Gabrielle Roy&apos;s Bonheur d&apos;occasion for example. Could it be that Hubert Aquin was disappointed by what he saw ? Real life is no novel.",

      "reviewBody": "This drama/love story could have been excellent. Played out against the last months of the corrupt and US/UK-supported Batista regime, the collapse of the old society as Castro&apos;s fidelistas begin to take over is shown compellingly. The point is well made that a revolution will only succeed if the people are behind it which, in this instance, they clearly were.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame that the movie couldn&apos;t have been filmed in Cuba, as of course all the famous landmarks of Havana are missing, but its real problems are threefold.\n\nFirstly the storyline is confusing, complicated and unconvincing, with none of the characters being allowed to hold one&apos;s attention.\n\nSecondly, the acting is poor. Even Sean Connery - who is normally excellent - seems to have had his mind on other things the whole time.\n\nAnd thirdly, for some inexplicable reason, the chanting of &apos;Fidel&apos; as Castro enters Havana in triumph morphs into a Nazi crowd chanting &apos;Sieg Heil&apos;. Whatever was this trying to say? When Castro actually came into power, one of the first things he did was to open all the &apos;whites-only&apos; clubs to black people, and to make it clear in an early speech that there was no such thing as a superior race. To liken Castro to Hitler is a travesty of the facts.\n\nSo, ultimately a flawed film. Watch it not for the story or the &apos;message&apos; but for what is going on in the background.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the first film of Radu Mihaileanu that really did it to me. It is moving, I resonated with the subject, I laughed when it was funny and I was close to tears when it meant to be emotional. Yet, as his previous films, it is not a masterpiece just a good film to remember. Which is no small matter either.\n\nMihaileanu&apos;s previous films were each of them based on original and different ideas. in each of those the ideas hold above the execution. &apos;Train de vie&apos; was one of the first films to deal with Holocaust from a comic perspective, and maybe the most interesting idea of all, better even as Begnini&apos;s maybe. &apos;Les pygmees de Carlo&apos; dealt with the communication between cultures in an unusual way. &apos;Vas, viens, et deviens&apos; is the only movie until now to deal with the Ethiopian immigration to Israel. Here, in &apos;Le Concert&apos; two main ideas dominate the action. One is about the new culture of vulgarity and mediocrity that dominates the life after the fall of the Communism. The main hero (wonderfully acted by Aleksei Gluskov) is a great conductor. His life and career were broken during the Communist rule for having opposed the regime of Brezhnev. Yet, the change of the social order did not put him back in place, as the collaborators of the old regime and the new oligarchs took the place of the rulers, siding the real values. The second idea is that music redeems, transcends politics, and is worth any risks and sacrifices.\n\n&apos;Le Concert&apos; is correspondingly divided into two parts. The first one is a brilliant comedy, one of the best that I have seen lately. It is based on stereotypes one may argue, the stereotype of the Russians and French, of the Jews and Gypsies, of musicians and impresarios, Communists and oligarchs, but in these case they work, and the result is true and funny. The Russian orchestra of former musicians, sided away by the new times makes it to Paris under the label of the Bolshoi to give the concert of their lives, the proof that Tchaikovsky, and Russian music, and value are still there despite all. Then the second part begins, the one in which all becomes personal, Then the second part begins, the one in which all becomes personal, with a seemingly love story which turns to be something completely different, a much more dramatic story in which music is not only revenge but also personal redemption, is not only survival but also coming from beyond the graves of a tragic history.\n\nThis is were the strength and the weakness of Radu Mihaileanu&apos;s art meet. All the film converges to the final scene, the one of the concert in Paris, we know it from the beginning. All the explanation will be present in that scene, and this is the bet and the risk of any music film in the history of cinema. The result is only a partial win. Tchaikovsky&apos;s Concerto for Violin provides the appropriate background, and the emotional result is immediate. The doubts start after the screening ends. The situation is certainly less than credible, from an intrigue and musical point of view. Mihaileanu&apos;s execution is too direct, he plays too much on short term emotions, tears are too apparent. He has huge ideas, and one day he may turn them into one or more great movies. &apos;Le Concert&apos; is too explicit, it lacks the patience and the sophistication to be that one .",

      "reviewBody": "Ayn Rand created herself out of whole cloth. This must be acknowledged, and yes it&apos;s impressive. Often an immigrant, who had to struggle for freedom, ends up doing more than a rank and file American, who takes it for granted. Rand was definitely a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately... paradoxically... over-achievers can also be full of cr*p. Any admiration for Rand must be tempered by the fact that her writing is a mono-maniacal, unpersuasive snooze. Add to that the sheer creepy, oiliness of the also-Rands she left behind, and she&apos;s a complete wash-out. No college studies Rand&apos;s disreputable &quot;philosophy.&quot;\n\nRand didn&apos;t have a body of work that became a school; instead she had a lot of hard-won, reactive opinions that became serviceable as a personal philosophy; and a generous segment of the population without rudders came to grovel at her feet, and hear why being selfish was actually a good thing; uniting sociopaths and young capitalists under one umbrella.\n\nShe quickly became a self-parody. She hated collectives terribly but paradoxically could only conceive of individualism as a cultish dogma she constrained you with. (!?) As few in America have a philosophical life, an early naive encounter with her material (as with $cientology, and Moonie literature) is apt to derail the development of actual emotional depth or a conscience for five to thirty years, lost in the fog of mystification and hero worship.\n\nHer work follows an absurd tiresome pattern. You could write the next Rand tome by just following this handy template: A vigorously independent industrialist wants to use (insert some industry) to prove he&apos;s got big brass ones. For 1,500 pages he must endure a bizarre gang of paper-deep anti-individualists motivated by volition that no one has ever actually encountered on earth (Bad man: &quot;grrrrr... I hate maverick individuals!&quot; Good man: &quot;I hate collectives!&quot;). But with the attention of an impressively miserable woman, who only experiences joy when (pick two: she breaks beautiful things / gets put in her place sexually / she can pursue her erotic fixation with machinery) they stand together in triumph on top of (pick one: his own skyscraper, his train, some other phallic symbol) in the end. Spare yourself a read of Atlas Shrugged and just wait for Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie&apos;s self-impressed, half-understood production which should be putting theater-goers to sleep in the next year or so.\n\nThe ultimate refutation of her ideas comes from Allen Greenspan, a Rand acolyte who when asked to explain why he allowed the country&apos;s economy to run itself into the ground, stated that he couldn&apos;t fathom that bankers would act in their own self-interest without concern for the well-being of the nation. Well, I guess that makes me smarter than you Allen. Please go away, Randlings.",

Everyone has a different emotion behind it and a different reason for their feelings. The film focuses on this theme.\n\nAccusations are flown around. Affairs are being exposed. Plots are being revealed. Secrets are being unravelled. Families are turning on each other and people are trying to use their enemies for personal gain. What a sad and thought-provoking film.\n\nThe characters and acting are wonderful. The dialogue is quick and witty. The settings are lovely and unique. The plot is riveting. The title describes the movie well. Despite the complexity of the plot, the movie is easy to follow and easily understood due to its timing and how it slowly and gradually reveals important details. \n\nFull of drama and romance, The Chase will have your eyes glued to your TV screen. Will Bubba get caught, killed, or find a way to be free? Will he be able to prove his innocence? Will Bubba ever get a normal life? I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves crime, drama, and/or thriller movies.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this many times over the years, and it&apos;s one of my absolute favorites. Some folks seem to think the Fleischers have to take a back seat to Disney. \n\nNOT !!\n\nThey were, in many instances ( such as this one), far more inventive than Disney, and their work did not lose touch with common emotions,and had broad-based appeal to all ages, despite technical complexity.\n\nMickey Mouse will never go off the air. But neither will Betty Boop or Popeye.\n\nIn its own special way, &quot;Gulliver&apos;s Travels&quot; rivals the Disney features with its complexity, and its lack of laziness. If you really look at it, and keep in mind that this is animation done by hand...the old fashioned way, you will have a keener appreciation for the hard work that went into it. In those days, Disney and the Fleischers had to run the studios like a factory. It took teams of men in units and working shifts to concentrate on just the movements of the characters to make them appear lifelike (not like the computer animation of to-day, or even the TV animation of UPA or Hanna-Barbera in the 1950s). \n\n&quot;Roto-scoping&quot;, a process invented by the Fleischers, made the task that much more daunting. But the Fleischers had to be &quot;perfectionists/masochists&quot;. The love of their craft shows in the movements, the backgrounds, the stories, and the music...not to mention the characters. \n\nI am truly taken with the score. It is warm and dreamy and romantic....tearful to some. Some folks can&apos;t get with it, but it&apos;s a shame we don&apos;t don&apos;t hear much real music like that anymore in the mainstream. \n\nWin Sharples and Victor Young did a very fine job...one of the best of All cartoon scores. Work on this film appears to have gotten Win Sharples the scoring job for the Fleischers, one he held down after the Fleischers were given the gate by Paramount, and which he continued to hold until Famous Studios was padlocked.\n\nI can&apos;t recommend this feature highly enough. It&apos;s good clean fun, an accurate character study, terrific music, animation...the &quot;whole nine&quot;.",

Warshawski&quot; for the third time and, for the third time, am at a total loss to understand the panning/overall rating of 4.3 awarded to it by previous reviewers. I think the movie DOES reflect a lot of the Paretsky original novels and think Turner does a good job in portraying &quot;the dick from the dock&quot; in a manner which combines both respect for the literary character and the kind of gritty, down-to-earth film noir genre which the film obviously pays its debts to. This latter aspect is particularly apparent in the DIALOGUE, much of which my wife and I found hysterical and easily on a par with such remakes of Chandler as the &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; version of the 1970s with Robert Mitchum and Charlotte Rampling. Like the letter, &quot;V.I.&quot; is not going to be rated as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; of the 1990s, but I still think it is a sound, entertaining and engaging piece of work, which does not deserve the reviews mentioned above. Now that we are past the &quot;Blow &apos;em up / SFX-dominated&quot; fayre of &quot;Die Hard 27&quot;or whatever, is it time for a follow-up to what was, in my view, sadly, Turner&apos;s sole donning of the red glitter shoes of V.I. with another actress in the role?",

      "reviewBody": "No one ever accused director George Hickenlooper of being too upbeat. His films share a pessimistic world-view and a love for flawed antiheroes that has been out of vogue in mainstream Hollywood since the 1970&apos;s. While The Man from Elysian Fields is his first film as director that he didn&apos;t write or co-write, it shares the same sensibilities of his most personal films; namely a struggling artist&apos;s middle American values being a casualty of life in contemporary Los Angeles. \n\nAndy Garcia is said artist, Byron Tiller. After his first novel received rave reviews but little sales, Byron is unable to get his second novel published. He can&apos;t afford to support his family, and after suffering a series of indignities to try and make ends meet, he strikes a Faustian bargain with a gentlemen pimp, Luther Fox (Mick Jagger) the owner and operator of Elysian Fields escort service. Tiller uneasily accepts his new role as a male escort, and low and behold his first client, Andrea Alcott (Olivia Williams of Rushmore), is the wife of a dying Pulitzer Prize winning novelist who needs help writing one last book before he dies.\n\nFrom this rather novel premise (one of Garcia&apos;s first lines is &apos;it&apos;s a premise, it&apos;s allowed to be ridiculous&apos;), the plot proceeds much as you would expect it to. But, hey, in tragedy, there aren&apos;t many places to go but down. What makes Elysian Fields worth watching are the performances. The late James Coburn is excellent as the crotchety old writer, Tobias Alcott. His ruminations on death are made all the more poignant by the fact that this was one of his final performances. Top billed Jagger is wonderfully understated as Fox, and Julianna Margulies does a good job of breathing life into the somewhat thankless role of Mrs. Tiller, the stock movie wife who is basically there to constantly tell her workaholic husband that she wishes he were home more. \n\nWhat&apos;s really significant about Elysian Fields is the way that Garcia, Hickenlooper and screenwriter Phillip Jayson Lasker have crafted the character of Byron Tiller. The indignities that Tiller suffers at the start of the film (at the hands of the publisher who rejects his book, his father-in-law, who refuses to loan him any money and the former boss who refuses to hire him back) could have been a set up for the &apos;emasculated man re-masculated&apos; plot. This popular revenge fantasy in which the white collar, white male rages against the machine (Fight Club, American Beauty, Office Space) is rendered improbable when the hero is turning tricks. This is the emasculated man, further emasculated. Garcia goes for broke, giving a brave performance as the not always likable Tiller. When he makes a last ditch effort to assert his manhood against the deceptive Mrs. Alcott, she coyly rebuffs his ranting and raving and his castration is complete. Jagger, as Fox says it best when he reminds Tiller &apos;don&apos;t forget that they&apos;re paying you, not as a writer, but as a whore. I guarantee, they haven&apos;t forgotten.&apos;"

Unlike Citizen Kane.\n\nThe premise of creating a film around emojis is extremely thin, however the result is suprisingly fun with some very good casting choices, such as Tim Miller. The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw this.\n\nIt also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji, by far the most unique role he&apos;s ever taken on.\n\nOverall it&apos;s great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing.",

Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone&apos;s user. In this world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become &quot;normal&quot; like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic &quot;app-venture&quot; through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it&apos;s deleted forever.",

The story itself is not that much complex: two couples, of the one the man and of the other the woman become unfaithful... But the gags in-between are terrific. There is this running gag on the 17 hippies playing music in front of the snack box, or the other one concerning Britney Spears, whose music is always running in the background, when scenes were shot at the local radio station. Many devices of the Dogma manifesto were used in this film: no artificial setting, laymen-acting, hand camera a.s.o., but the splendour of a &quot;Idioterne&quot; (Lars von Trier, 1998)  or &quot;Festen&quot; (Thomas Vinterberg, 1998) is not achieved. Nevertheless, I liked the movie and was surprised, since most recent German releases bored me a lot. 8* (out of 10*)",

It is a thirty minute short film that features improved animation, and takes place towards the end of the series. It has one incredible song, Heat and Soul, which happens to be my favorite song prior Dynamite 7. The story isn&apos;t some epic, but it is similar to fleet of the strongest woman or the encore episodes. Overall, a nice 30 minutes spent for fans of the series, those who aren&apos;t familiar with Macross 7 will only feel lost though. This is a movie based on the show, there will be no character development worthy of someone new the series, but fans of the show will surely enjoy this &apos;movie&apos;."

Its a storyline that Kim-Duk should feel right at home with. And for the first twenty five minutes or so it looks promising. Rich atmosphere with tasteful use of music. I was just waiting for him to really start WORKING with the story and ideas at hand.\n\nI don&apos;t think he does that. To me it looks like Kim-Duks abandons much of his graceful soul-searching in favor of fleshy melodrama. Especially the awkward shouting-scene at the field, but the whole film has something contrived about it. The main-character are very illogical in their thinking, with may indicate that the film is meant to work on a allegorical level, but I&apos;m dubious. The cinematography too strikes me as bland, with some interesting exceptions. There are faint echoes of 3-Iron here, the film that more and more stands out as his masterpiece, but lacks most of its subtle grace.\n\nWell, until the end that is. The breathtaking and magical scene where she &quot;escapes&quot; confirms that Kim-Duk still has it in him,(but I&apos;m not wild about how it ties everythinkg together so neatly), as much as i respect him as an artist, i think Kim-Duk needs to relocate and form ranks.",

      "reviewBody": "In India, Tilo (Aishwarya Rai) has the ability of foreseeing the future. When their parents are killed by bandits, she is kidnapped but escapes and is raised by the First Mother (Zohra Segal) in a sort of traditional cult of spices. She becomes the Mistress of Spices and is sent to the Spice Bazaar in San Francisco, with the mission of following three basic rules: help her clients to accomplish their desires with the spices, but never hers; never leave the store; and never be touched in the skin. When she meets the handsome American architect Doug (Dylan McDermott), she feels a great attraction and desire for him, breaking the first rule and being punished by the spices.\n\n&quot;The Mistress of Spices&quot; is a predictable but pleasant film that uses the idea of movies like &quot;Chocolate&quot;, &quot;Woman on Top&quot;, &quot;Como Agua Para Chocolate&quot; blending romance with food or spice or chocolate or cookies. Therefore, the flawed story has no originality and is quite boring and messy in many moments. However, the cinematography is wonderful, with magnificent colors highlighted on DVD. Further, the gorgeous Miss World 1994 and Queen of Bollywood Aishwarya Rai makes this little film worth with her beauty and participating in most of the scenes. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Sabor da Magia&quot; (&quot;The Flavor of Magic&quot;)",

Melina Mercouri is great as the widow of a shadowy underworld figure who entangles James Garner in her search for missing booty.  The booty being a small fortune in loose diamonds.  The movie has lots of sixties style going for it and is set in beautiful Mediterranean locales.  With a great supporting cast of sixties superstars like Sandra Dee and Tony Franciosa the movie entertains with tons of tounge in cheek, cloak and dagger sexy verve. It&apos;s a fun in the sun movie with all the stars putting in great performances.  One final note, as the credits roll at the end of the movie, Frank Sinatra&apos;s rendition of Strangers in the Night provides a fitting and satisfying end."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s weird to think that there once was a time when the whole world didn&apos;t know about Jackie Chan. It&apos;s even weirder to realize that at one time, he was introduced to us but we didn&apos;t think to remember him. BATTLE CREEK BRAWL is odd for being a Hong Kong-inspired movie before Hollywood knew the value of the HK influence. But while director Robert Clouse may have been unable to capitalize on Jackie Chan like he did Bruce Lee, this is still an exciting adventure and an interesting study of one of the earlier chapters of one of the genre&apos;s top stars.\n\nThe story: A martial arts-practicing adventurer (Chan) runs afoul of a Chicago crime syndicate and is strong-armed into competing in an all-important toughman contest.\n\nWhile there are plenty of criticisms to be leveled at this film, I don&apos;t accept its departure from the style of other JC movies as one of them. Director Clouse isn&apos;t Stanley Tong, and he doesn&apos;t need to be: his utilization of Jackie isn&apos;t the ideal standard, but someone as talented as Chan benefits from showing poise in alternative circumstances. Admittedly, one casualty of Clouse&apos;s style is Chan&apos;s comedy, which comes across as clumsy and childish, but his action scenes remain pretty swell. Almost none of his on screen opponents approach Chan&apos;s level of agility and they clearly aren&apos;t comfortable with the hero&apos;s rhythmic style, but Jackie&apos;s athletic abandon is matched by satisfying, stunt-heavy choreography. The filmmakers keep the camera pulled back, diminishing our boy&apos;s facial expressions but showing off the authenticity of his abilities. Given that this was the first time Chan was being captured as a lead outside of Hong Kong, I&apos;m impressed with the results.\n\nThe production is on the modest side of respectable. Clouse works well in small, homey locations and pulls off the 1930s setting pretty smoothly. Disappointingly, the story and characters within the setting are not intriguing. The screenplay offers exactly one character and relationship that I found intriguing: dear old Mako in his surprisingly stern role as Jackie&apos;s mentor. Everyone else, from Chan&apos;s on screen girlfriend (Kristine DeBell) to the evil champion (H.B. Haggerty), are simply varying shades of boring. Even Oscar-winner Jose Ferrer is incredibly vanilla as the lead villain and doesn&apos;t enliven a story that&apos;s almost solely kept afloat by its lead star&apos;s infectious talent. Chan himself isn&apos;t at his best either, though this is mainly due to his discomfort with English at this point, and his physical expressiveness conveys a lot of what his dialogue doesn&apos;t.\n\nBATTLE CREEK BRAWL teeters on a less enthusiastic rating, but eventually wins me over through its strengths. It&apos;s not surprising that this film didn&apos;t make Jackie Chan a household name, but it&apos;s good enough to qualify as a collector&apos;s item for the right viewer. The one thing all viewers needs to do when watching is not expect RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, and if you manage that, you&apos;ll probably have a good time.",

Several scenes were filmed on the Ohio River at Smithland, Ky, where I lived and also operated the local ambulance service. My Father was a Deputy Sheriff and became very friendly with Tommy Lee Jones during the filming. I also had the honor of having breakfast with Mr. Jones.\n\nSmithland was also the location of most of the &quot;Rivers&quot; segments of the classic movie &quot; How The West was Won &quot;. I still have cast photos and autographs from Jimmy Stewart, Agnes Morehead, George Peppard and Debbie Reynolds from that movie. &quot; The River Rat &quot; was and in my opinion is a great movie.",

Maybe River was young and they thought he will have many other chances to do it, unfortunately you never know and now River is no longer with us. So I think that the members of the Academy should consider this, like when Leo DiCaprio was nominated for Gilbert Grape. Anyway, this is a MUST see movie, it´s definitely a classic!"

Not only does Stakeout capture the magic of the &apos;80s, it also brings forth a world many of us miss, and does so in a way that not many movies of that era managed to do. What is so great about this movie is that you always feel you are part of it somehow. You are right there with Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez, almost like you are their invisible partner. That&apos;s how good those two are. You will laugh and feel the excitement until the very last minute. To me, Stakeout is a feel good machine that leaves a strong impression on anyone who misses the era it was made in.\n\nP.S. How beautiful was Madeleine Stowe?",

Because that it is how most of the humor is in the movie, minus the laugh track. The show is a big hit sensation, and the two characters Ray Romano play, in personality and such, are very similiar. \n\nThe story is pretty outrageous, but in a good way. The movie had the nice friendly small town feel to it. Kind of like Groundhog Day did, minus the having the same day happen over and over again thing, and that entire storyline. \n\nIt is a pretty friendly movie, and pretty funny as well. Had my laughing on a few occasions. Worth the watch. Don&apos;t be intimidated by the reviews. It is a good movie."

      "reviewBody": "Carole Lombard was one of Hollywood&apos;s finest comediennes; she worked best when she was backed by an equally strong male lead  in this case, it&apos;s Fred MacMurray, with whom she must have clicked because they appeared together three more times (two of these films, THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS [1936] and TRUE CONFESSION [1937], are also included in Universal&apos;s 2-Disc Lombard collection and I should get to them in the next couple of days).\n\nThe comic style of the film falls somewhere between sophisticated and screwball: lavish settings and stuffy aristocratic characters are mingled with the often zany working-class (keeping their chin up during the Depression but, in Lombard&apos;s case, harboring a desire to marry into money); the title refers to her job as a manicurist. Typically for this type of film, when she sets her eyes on a gentleman of title  who&apos;s young and handsome to boot (MacMurray)  he turns out to be engaged to an even wealthier lady (Astrid Allwyn), because he&apos;s himself penniless! Running after her (the term is put lightly here, since he&apos;s actually wheelchair-bound) is an ex-air ace played by the actor who cornered the market around this time in &quot;Other Man&quot; roles, Ralph Bellamy, who&apos;s naturally got a lot of money and thinks of Lombard as a perfect match  but his love goes unrequited.\n\nThe mixture includes slapstick, wisecracks, romance, drama and even a bit of sentimentality (Lombard spends a good part of the last act sobbing). Still, as always in these more innocent times (where, for instance, a woman has to turn around when the man she&apos;s living with  albeit platonically, for the moment  is about to wear his pants!), none of the characters are really unsympatheticso that we don&apos;t even despise the jilted lovers, who are understanding enough to know when to give up. The ending of the film is a classic: Lombard and MacMurray cause a traffic jam to look for a missing penny on which they&apos;ve staked the course of their future! Appearing in one scene as a prospective boyfriend of Lombard&apos;s (whom MacMurray scares away) is future Preston Sturges regular William Demarest.\n\nThe film was shown in the early 1990s on late-night Italian TV in its original language with forced Italian subtitles, but I had missed it (the same thing is true for the afore-mentioned THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS and MacMurray&apos;s other film with Leisen  TAKE A LETTER, DARLING [1942]); I did, however, acquire some of the director&apos;s other great work this way  most of which is, regrettably, still unavailable on DVD...",

Just ordinary men (and boys) doing the job they knew they had got to do. Greg Peck magnificent as the general forced to stiffen the morale of his bomber group, and who he himself eventually cracks under the strain. Dean Jagger outstanding and thoroughly deserving his oscar as best supporting actor. A truly great film, 10 out of 10 in my book. There are still disused airfields like that shown at the beginning only a few miles from where I live  (although they were RAF bases).  In 1943-45 as a young schoolboy I lived further down south in England  and often saw the American Fortresses going to, and returning (not all of them!) from their daylight raids over Germany . A fine tribute to those American airmen wo gave their lives over Europe.",

This movie didn&apos;t really leave an impression. Maybe it&apos;s safe to say it&apos;s an animated film more suited for kids. After all, the whole rescue plot flows smoothly without much complexity or guessing involved.",

      "reviewBody": "It seems that art films come in all shapes and sizes these days. If you look hard enough you&apos;ll find small independent art films within any genre. Take Shelter is a film you will find amongst dramatic thrillers, and it is definitely one you should seek out. It stars Michael Shannon as Curtis, a middle class family man working on the pipeline in Ohio. He leads a capable life where he must cope with his monetary issues as well as his deaf daughter. But he makes the most of it and lives a life of relative ease and compassion for his family. However, things become complicated when he starts seeing apocalyptic visions of a terrible storm he believes is on its way. The dreams and visions make his life very difficult and it becomes increasingly more stressful. Curtis must fight a battle within himself as he tries to figure out if these visions are meaningful or if he is just going crazy, as well as with his family and friends who become more disconnected from him as his sanity seems to deteriorate before their eyes. Take Shelter is a harrowing, dramatic, and slow building film that will surely amaze you once it is all over.\n\nTake Shelter is a film that moves so slowly and builds so dramatically that one begins to wonder if we&apos;re every getting to the end. It&apos;s an incredibly quiet and sincerely somber film. We spend almost the entire movie honing in on Michael Shannon&apos;s powerful facial expressions and the deep thought going into the story. It progresses so slowly with a build up that pushes its way through molasses.\n\nI&apos;ll admit that I was getting worried about this film not being as good as I expected it to be. I was afraid it might not live up to my expectations and that the payoff wouldn&apos;t be worth the crawling build up. But one you reach the end you will be incredibly satisfied. The payoff is incredible. I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better ending. It could not have been executed more precisely. It plays to something bigger than what you could have ever expected from this fantastic film. Just as my mind began to slip away from Take Shelter it ended with such a deep and deafening bang that my eyes flew open to realize the incredible film I had just sat through.\n\nTake Shelter might not look like much at first, but it turns out to be a tremendous film. It&apos;s smart, engaging, fascinating, and brutally sincere. This is a must see film for 2011. Depending on your attention span you may want to give up about an hour and a half in, but if you stick around for the end you will be very satisfied. I guarantee it.",

IT had a close to A list cast, looked great on the video box when I rented it (Circa 1994 I think) started off with promise but rapidly became a mess.... It sorta has the feel of an unfinished and un-post produced mainstream scifi action flick.\n\nTerrible editing and f/x. Uninspired dialogue and generic plot. What the hell was Paxton and Hurt doing in this? Even Gossett jnr was a pull around this time.. Did the director have some juicy info on them all to get them to work on this dross? Thankfully for him Gossett shows some good judgement (watch and it&apos;ll make sense)\n\nI see the same director did Project Shadowchaser, A video staple of rentals in the uk during the early 90&apos;s. That had Martin Kove and the Android to hold it together. Here the stars just seem to be trying to battle thru to the end and forget they were involved lol",

      "reviewBody": "I saw Sheitan at the Melbourne International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed 26 year old Kim Chapitan&apos;s directorial debut.\n\nSheitan, meaning Satan in Persian, follows a group of 4 French kids on a roadtrip to an exotic vixen&apos;s country retreat on Christmas Eve. Upon arrival we greet the intoxicating local family who are a &apos;banjo shy of a Cahulawassee River ride&apos;, Deliverance style.\n\nThe buildup of tension is the film&apos;s greatest asset as we fall for the motley locals before all hell breaks loose in diabolical circumstances. There&apos;s enough lashings of nudity to titillate and a fantastic scene involving a placenta and the best use of SFX for a long time.\n\nGreat acting for a horror movie, including a superb performance by Vincent Cassell who proves he&apos;s as good as he is in front of the camera as he is behind it, a breathtaking performance by Roxane Mesquida and a blink and you&apos;ll miss it cameo by Monica Bellucci.\n\nThe art direction/ set design was perfect, the Provincial French manor where the kids end up is as beautiful as it is haunting. If clowns don&apos;t scare the hell out of me, dolls do, and Sheitan certainly pushes the right buttons whilst not resorting to &apos;Chucky&apos; style offerings. A beautiful soundmix accompanies the pictures providing some of the best sound effects work seen for a fair while.\n\nFor a directorial debut, Chapiron is streets ahead of Eli Roth, again proving that the best horror directors aren&apos;t in Hollywood. As part of the emerging French group Kourtajme&apos;, Chapiron has greatly learned from some of his more famous contemporaries, namely Cassel.\n\nSo kudos to you Mr Chapiron. A few editing flaws stop me giving a higher score but a good 8 for a debut film is nothing to sneeze at, and announce yourself on the horror stage as a star of the future.",

      "reviewBody": "Westeners think they are rational and good people. Immigrants learn quite soon what are the weak points in our culture and in us. We think we are coherent and clever but someone looking from outside easily solves the knot of coherence and cleverness. Andres Thiel&apos;s fine film gives us one night, one immigrant of second generation and three &quot;clever&quot; German people. And heat. Jan and Christine are naive, even stupid students who play the compulsory play of dating, separating and committing (whatever). Once again separated Jan bumps to a Turkish guy Tony who keeps Jan running after his whistle. He asks Jan for five minutes to tell him his story. This five minutes grows to a school of Western Morality and Hypocrisy. Jan presents every single belief we cherish but in context that shows them ridiculous. Both Jan and Christine are like kids whose reason is gravely underdeveloped. They &quot;want&quot; everything, they &quot;desire&quot; all, they &quot;can&apos;t&quot; something but they have no idea what life is all about. Tony, on the contrary, knows well: he has his agenda, no sentimentalism, nothing free. Westeners are make-believe people with book-learned ideas. But in real situation every one of us is like vermin, too: in case one has power over any other person, we use it even if it be an ax. The film is very wise, very embarrassing if one has any shame left, and has in Tony&apos;s role the most charming home-Turk of Hamburg, Faith Akin.",

      "reviewBody": "It all depends how you approach this film. DO NOT expect a linear plot line, either by story or history. Do not expect it to explain itself for, like 2001, it leaves more questions open than it answers. This is a truly odd duck of a film and once you open up to what it SAYS about life and liberty, you can appreciate it. I disliked it at first view a long time ago and for the obvious reasons - the plot is a pencil sketch of the first order. King Arthur whacking limbs off the Black Knight makes more sense. But scrap that and listen to what the actors are SAYING about life and liberty and THEN it makes sense, for this is an allegory of a film. The closest I can find elsewhere is OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR which uses allegory just as well. Danny Kaye is always a treat, but Hepburn is in glorious 1913 costumes and owns the show, and remember this is 1969. The same year as THE LION IN WINTER for an entirely different performance. So you have to junk many standard film rules aside and THEN you will find this a very good treat of film. Have it with good French Bordeaux and cheese too. Then go outside and see if you can smell a cafe in Paris serving their unique nuclear coffee. Who knows? You may wind up there too.",

      "reviewBody": "Obvious mannequins are propelled skyward for some unexplained (and unintentionally funny) reason, as a shark, or in some scenes, a dolphin, terrorizes a small coastal community, just like in that other shark movie. Intro scene has seemingly never-ending windsurfing footage culminating with the shark causing the guy and his board to explode out and fly up out of the water! The bite marks in what&apos;s left of the board look more like razor slashes, at angles which could not have possibly been made by a shark, as we go back to the &quot;bite radius&quot; bit from Jaws. And remember when the head in the boat scared Hooper (and us, the audience) in Jaws? There is even a rip off of that here, as we find an arm bitten off by the shark. And, aww, innit that cute, they even tied a pink balloon around the shark to track it. Are you kidding me? Is that the low rent substitute of Quint&apos;s yellow barrels, pink ballons? \n\nThere actually is a little bit of tension toward the end of this one, in between bouts of unintended comedy, and some of the modelwork is amusing, The shark looks okay at a distance or at high angles, but when we&apos;re shown the shark at closer angles and for longer amounts of time, we realise just how inferior to Jaws it really is. \n\nRon succumbs to a fate similar to Quint&apos;s, in Peter Benchley&apos;s original novel, but the film is too derivative and slowly paced to amount to much more than a third-rate ripoff. Such a close ripoff, in fact, that Steven Spielberg and co. took legal action against the makers of this one, and had the movie effectively banned.",

      "reviewBody": "At the start of this film, hit-man Tony Arzenta wishes his son many future birthdays, so you kind of know how that&apos;s gonna work out...eh? One accidentally blown up family later, Tony&apos;s out to get everyone involved. All he wanted to do was leave the mob, but we all know that there&apos;s only one way to leave the mob, and that&apos;s by industrial tribunal...no wait...\n\nWhat made this film stand out for me is the overwhelming sense of style that is apparent in every frame. The primary colours are played out with precision in every scene, from the decor, to the clothing, to parked cars, everything is decked out in yellow, blue, or red. Watch the film and see what I mean. An immense amount of detail has gone into the cinematography here, and that makes the film worth watching.\n\nOther than that - our leading man in icy and laid back, but it&apos;s Richard Conte who stands out for me as the mafia don. He&apos;s world weary and genuinely shocked that the mafia have accidentally killed a woman and a child, and his whole approach to the Tony Arzenta problem is handled in a business-like, resigned manner. Conte is great here, just like he was in The Violent Professionals.\n\nThis is a classic and was unknown to me until I received it as part of an Italian Crime Movie box set. One of the best (in my opinion, of course).",

      "reviewBody": "Of course I had never heard about this 2005 sci-fi horror movie titled &quot;Alien Abduction&quot; prior to stumbling upon the movie by random chance here in 2024. And I have to say that the movie&apos;s cover was actually interesting enough to make me pick it up. And since it was a horror movie of sorts, that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a fair chance.\n\nAnd as the movie started, my expectations went from slim to none. Why? Well, this was a movie from The Asylum. Yeah, not exactly a movie company with a stellar production value throughout all the years. But every now and again The Asylum does spew out something good, so of course I watched the movie, hoping that this would be one such movie.\n\nI have to say that writer and director Eric Forsberg sure didn&apos;t waste any time setting up the movie and planting a narrative. Nay, the movie just throws the audience into the action right away. And that was actually something I enjoyed. But the movie quickly settled into a slump and a slow paced trot, from which it never recovered. And it was quite a struggle to sit through the movie once the narrative moved to the mental institution.\n\nThe only familiar face on the screen, for me, was actor Griff Furst. It should be noted, that even while the script was rubbish, then the acting performances in the movie were fair.\n\nThe sounds that the alien creature was making were insanely annoying, and they almost made me turn off the movie. It was quite a struggle to sit through and listen to those ridiculous and super annoying sounds. And it didn&apos;t help much that the alien creature design looked like it was made from paper mache in an Arts and Crafts class and some resin mask from Wish to top it off. It was so horrible low budget and home-made.\n\nThis movie was a swing and a miss of a movie in terms of being entertaining. And it definitely is not a movie that I would recommend you to sit down and waste 96 minutes on watching. Some of us suffered through this dumpster fire of a movie so you don&apos;t have to; you&apos;re very welcome. You will probably end up wishing that you would be abducted so you don&apos;t have to suffer through this ordeal, should you opt to actually sit down and watch it.\n\nThe movie&apos;s cover was actually the best thing about the ordeal.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Alien Abduction&quot; lands on a two out of ten stars.",

The oversight was minimized with a callous what&apos;s-done-is-done argument, but evidence has since shown it to have been a deliberate (and successful) attempt to provide scientists with a perfect, insulated testing ground for studying the effects of radiation on human beings. Dennis O&apos;Rourke&apos;s look at the harrowing aftermath to Operation Bravo sounds at times like speculative fiction, but his evenhanded documentation of some damning facts is too convincing to be anything but the truth. President Reagan himself is allowed to deliver the final epitaph, tacitly admitting a duplicity of frightening proportions.",

      "reviewBody": "The Raid, a new non-stop cornucopia action film, comes from the most unlikely of sources – Indonesia. But don&apos;t let the country of origin fool you. The Raid is jam packed with some of the best action sequences we&apos;ve seen in years and audiences are sure to walk away with an adrenaline rush punch to the gut that far exceeds their forked (over) entertainment dollar.\n\nStarring a bunch of actors we can guarantee you have never heard of and written and directed by Gareth Evans (another name you are surely not to recognize), The Raid offers big time action sequences chalked full of gunfights, knife fights and enough hand-to-hand combat to rival any movie in recent memory.\n\nThe idea behind The Raid is remedial. A group of well armed police officers enter a 15-story apartment complex overflowing with a group of better armed drug dealers and bad guys intent on holding their ground. The police are lead by an over anxious Lieutenant who leads his squad of mostly rookies into the apartment complex where they are quickly over matched and out gunned. Their objective is to find the drug lord who resides on the 15th floor and bring him to justice. Easier said than done.\n\nBodies on both sides of battle fall to the ground like rounds from a Gatling gun in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The police – those that survived the opening shootout – are split into two groups with Jaka (Joe Taslim) fighting alongside the Lieutenant and a rookie officer, and Rama (Iko Uwais) who tries to protect an injured officer while battling the hordes of oncoming baddies.\n\nWhat ensues over the course of the next 80-minutes is a rip-roarin&apos; blast of gratuitous bloodletting. The gun battles are more intense than the bank robbery scene in Michael Mann&apos;s Heat, the apartment hallway battles make the scene in Oldboy look like a Pixar film and the cops are as overmatched as U.S. Army Rangers were against an entire Somalian town Black Hawk Down.\n\nDirector Gareth Evans clearly wants you to leave your brains at the door and celebrate in violent beatings and fight sequences that were stylishly choreographed and continue with such relentless regularity that you almost want to pause the projector to catch your breath before the next group of bare-fisted bruisers hit the screen. Our two main leads take more body blows than John McClane did in all four Die Hard films and their resilience and ability to be beaten to a pulp and yet have the ability and the strength to continue fighting is beyond this reviewer&apos;s comprehension.\n\nIf there was but one small issue we had with the film it was that everyone who lived in the apartment complex had the fighting skills of an UFC righter or karate expert. Young, small, big or tall, they hall knew how to deliver a multiple high-kicks or at least take one and get right back up for more.\n\nThere is a small twist in the film that is clearly evident a reel before the actual reveal on screen, but it hardly takes away from the fun filled excitement leading up to the plot turn.\n\nThe sum of all its parts makes The Raid a must-see for anyone appreciative of non-stop battles where machetes are luxury and where a broken fluorescent tube can send a packed theatre into jubilant applause. It may lack the sophistication of The Departed, but it catered to an audience that couldn&apos;t get enough by the half-way mark and then was left gasping for air like a prized fighter in the 12th round towards its conclusion.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

Three years later, with 6 witnesses dead, a TV reporter present at the killing is frightened for her life. She takes her fears to a journalist ex-boyfriend. At first he is sceptical...\n\nBrilliant paranoid thriller from Pakula, utilising choppy realism and naturalistic dialogue to create a bleak and uncompromising picture of cynical, corporate conspiracy within US politics. Beatty has never been better as the ambitious journo-hack Joe Frady, and he is superbly supported by Cronyn, Daniels and a deeply compelling cameo from Prentiss. You can bet this wasn&apos;t diluted by audience testing prior to release... unmissable."

Pennebaker and Bob Neuwirth, Dylan&apos;s pal and &quot;tour manager&quot; who was along for the ride on the &apos;65 tour of England this film documents. Their thoughts are interesting, often insightful, occasionally hilarious and shed some light on the movie&apos;s more esoteric moments. For example, I never realized the extended hotel room scene of Dylan playing the piano was Bob actually _writing_ a piece of music. You&apos;ll probably learn something even if you&apos;ve read all the books (Benson, Heylin, etc.). Oh, and it turns out Albert Grossman _loves_ the way he&apos;s portrayed in the movie, according to Pennebaker. Plus there&apos;s a fun alternate version of the &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; video (which, for the kids out there, was copied in the &apos;80s by INXS for their &quot;Mediate&quot; video) that was shot in a park somewhere, in which Dylan has even less control of the cards than he does in the final cut. Ginsberg is in the background of this one, too.",

Why the men of Venus can&apos;t cut the mustard is never made clear but nevertheless, it&apos;s the ever-popular Pipporo who gets the nod. He rides through the Mexican landscape warbling from the saddle while, somewhere behind a cactus, an accordion provides the back-up music. As might be expected, he is unwilling to make the trip to Venus, even though the aliens are wearing fishnet hose and reallllly high heels. So the girls unleash on mankind, some of the worst monsters conceived in film but to no avail. Pipporo &apos;aint leaving and in the end, the invaders are repulsed with weapons that wouldn&apos;t stop a gang of senior citizens on Valium.\n\nThis film is such fun that you have to love it. Check out the skeleton with a cow&apos;s head that keeps repeating &quot;Ha, Ha, Ha&quot;. It&apos;s a blast!!!!",

I just feel if this has been filmed in a traditional way rather than going down the found footage route, it would have been even better, although to be fair, as found footage films go, this is my second favourite, my favourite being the Brit chiller &apos;The Borderlands&apos;.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing outlandish in the storyline, all seems quite plausible, and the way it&apos;s done all seems believable.\n\nThe special effects are rather convincing, and often quite gory.\n\nActing is first rate, and have to say watching it in 2023, seems to have given the film an added edge. Having been to a beach resort recently and seeing things floating in the water I&apos;d rather I hadn&apos;t, it does make you wonder about our oceans.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch.",

The hero is very likable and you always cheering him to come out on top. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a hilarious movie or keep you on the edge of your seat, it had its moments. I would consider the movie a good waste of time. It&apos;s nice to have a film out there that is light and avoid bathroom jokes and video-game type violence.

In the intention of the director, it should have been a documentary on the Jewish community in Czernowitz in Bucovina, land that in this century has passed from the Austrian Empire to Rumania, occupied by Nazi troops during the war, passed to Soviet Union afterwards and nowadays to Ukraina. Most of these rulers lead an anti-Semitic politics (guess which ones), so that now the Jewish community is reduced to very few survivors. But when the director met Mr. Zwilling, a 70-year-old teacher in the local school and his friend, Ms. Zuckermann, a 90-year-old retired teacher, he realized that they were interesting people in themselves, not only in what they represented. That is where the force of the movie lies: the only thing the director does is letting a cameraman follow Mr. Zwilling who shows us the only Jewish remains in Czernowitz and who visits Ms. Zuckermann every evening. And the dialogues between the optimistic Ms. Zuckermann (who lost all her relatives in a lager and nevertheless says &quot;Well, now we have no more Hitler, no more Stalin...&quot;) and the pessimistic Mr. Zwilling (&quot;Yes, but this winter will be very cold!&quot;) are full of so much wit and life that should be studied by lots of professional screenwriters... Unfortunately such a film, shot in several languages, the most important of them German, the language the two old people use to talk to each other, will remain in the German territory and won&apos;t go probably abroad: the only hope is that it will be discovered by some cine-clubs...",

Geraldine Farrar might not look the part of Joan but she manages to convey all the power, spirituality and vulnerability the part demands.  her acting is a little theatrical as you would expect from an opera diva but she is excellent nontheless.  Wallace Reid (a tragic casualty of Hollywood not that long after this) is pretty good as well, although I thought the love story angle stretched credibility a bit in places.  The film itself meanders a bit but when you consider it is over eighty years old it still retains a remarkable amount of effect.  Not as good as the 1928 Dreyer film but one to seek out."

I mean I understand making tweaks here and there but let&apos;s be clear this shares little to nothing with the 1986 original.\n\nThough I deemed the original movie rather overrated I at least appreciated the intricate story that it wove. This 2008 remake throws the originals concept out the window and comes up with something all of it&apos;s own, sadly what it&apos;s replaced with is generic Hollywood tripe and not even the top shelf tripe.\n\nWith an interchangeable forgettable cast playing top 1% spoiled trust fund babies we see a mindless tale about a prank gone wrong and the past coming back to haunt them one year later. So again, this doesn&apos;t even resemble the original movie.\n\nThe characters are detestable, news flash it&apos;s very hard to care about the plights of wretched human beings such as these (And no there isn&apos;t a &quot;Nice&quot; one mixed in). For this reason I was entirely unable to give a crap about the fates of these people and considering how dull the plot was I couldn&apos;t find it in myself to care about that either.\n\nDid you like the original? If so this won&apos;t appeal to you. But do you like slashers? If so then again this won&apos;t appeal to you\n\nThe Good:\n\nNope\n\nThe Bad:\n\nVile characters\n\nHardly a remake\n\nAs generic as conceivably possible",

      "reviewBody": "Because children are normally associated with innocence, creepy children are a tried concept in horror films. See movies like &quot;The innocents&quot; (1961, Jack Clayton) (pay attention to the title) and &quot;The omen&quot; (1976, Richard Donner)\n\nSince the mass massacres on high schools in the United States, most notably in Littleton in 1999, creepy kids have made their entrance also in drama films and documentaries. Examples are &quot;Elephant&quot; (Gus van Sant, 2003) and &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; (2002, Michael Moore).\n\n&quot;We need to talk about Kevin&quot; is somewhere in between drama and horror. More interesting than the genre classification is probably the distinction between creepy children movies with the emphasis on the child on the hand and the emphasis on (one of) the parents on the other hand. Just like in &quot;The innocents&quot; (although in this film the parent is a nanny) the emphasis in &quot;We need to talk about Kevin&quot; is on one of the parents, to be more precise on the mother played by Tilda Swinton in a terrific role.\n\nDuring the upbringing of Kevin Tilda Swinton discovers more and more disturbing symptoms in her son. Because the father is absent most of the time he doesn&apos;t believe her (in the evening Kevin is really sweet). This state of affairs shows the tragedy of the mother. When it goes all right with Kevin she is crazy, when it goes out of hand she has been a bad mother.\n\nI already called attention to the great performance of Tilda Swinton. She is the drama element of the film. Ezra Miller, who plays Kevin as a teenager, is the horror element. With lips that are a little too red, he is sometimes however a little over the top.",

I was expecting a typical war film, focusing on demonizing the &quot;other side&quot; (Serbs, Bosniaks) and rewriting the history books like &quot;Undeground&quot; or &quot;Pretty Village, Pretty Flame&quot;. But instead the film does not vilify anyone nor create a victim complex. The film is focused on a group of Yugoslav soldiers who plan to join the effort of fighting for the country&apos;s (Croatia) Independence, defecting from the Yugoslav army. Other Croats seem to view it their duty to uphold Yugoslav unity and stay. Without spoiling anything, the viewpoints of both pro-Independence Croats and pro-Yugoslavia Croats is given a humane view. Betray your fellow soldiers or your fellow people? The film is neither anti nor pro Yugoslavia. Truly a breath of fresh air in terms of a war film. Carnage is into the focus, but the complicated life decisions each character is making as the war unravels.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; somehow manages to avoid being corny or sappy and also avoids being religiously preachy. By sticking to straightforward storytelling it gets the job done in a dignified way that retains your interest as the story unfolds.\n\nSpencer Tracy is too old and craggy for the romantic scenes with a much younger actress, but utterly dominates the film in a constructive manner through extreme talent and skill. He manages to dominate the film without being noisy or over-acting. As usual an amazing demonstration of acting skill by Tracy.\n\nVan Johnson, basically a humble, kindly sort of actor is appropriately cast as a poor man in the hard-working carpentry profession. Leo Genn of the golden voice and saintly countenance is well cast as a gentle, religious-minded leader. Actually Genn&apos;s voice is beyond golden- I would describe his voice as 24-carat gold or maybe even platinum. Gene Tierney, a complex and tragic beauty and fine actress, is cast as what else... you guessed it, her character is beautiful and tragic. And on and on I could comment about the triumphs of good casting that add immeasurably to the success of &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot;.\n\nThe script is not very dynamic, and while not intense in the movie-drama sense, manages to avoid all the maudlin or preachy traps that it could have fallen into. So, while being far from great, this movie is watchable and generally succeeds in my opinion.",

Götz George is supposed to be one of the best German actors, and after this movie the viewer knows why. Here he really shows what he is able to. I rarely (never?) saw such an intense, brilliant and convincing performance before. The sparse environment has the effect that the viewer can concentrate himself on the acting - and and this is what makes this film worth seeing. \n\nBut it&apos;s not only Götz George. The other actors (esp. Jürgen Hentsch as the psychiatrist and Pierre Franckh as the stenographer) are performing impressive and convincing. They are a well contrast and counterpart for George alias Haarmann. This prevents this movie from becoming a Götz-George-One-Man-Show. \n\nI rated this with 8 because I think. a film for a 9 or even 10 should make more use of the diverse capabilities of the medium. After all a good film, but an absolute excellent play.",

When it is discovered that he can fight, he is put in the ring for the entertainment of the SS officers. This doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;re safe, not even with him making a contact with a gypsy(Olmos) who is also granted a temporary &quot;tolerance&quot;. Based on a true story.\n\nThis is among the most detailed, authentic and gripping pictures about its subject that I know of. The sheer volume of awful events, ways to be singled out and murdered and lies told by Nazis to avoid panic is impressive for being fit into the 1 hour 51 and a half minute running time. Production values are high. Acting is great for all concerned, with numerous subtle performances.\n\nGoing to great lengths to avoid being exploitative, this has few on-screen deaths, piles of dead and little naked skin. And yet, so much is communicated. Some recurring images convey far more than gore ever could. A reaction shot of conveys the horror inside the crematorium. And we know exactly what it means when we see the smoke from its chimney, or a train pulling in to, as my father solemnly put it as we watched it together, &quot;the end of the line&quot;.\n\nThere is a lot of disturbing, and some bloody, content in this. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone old enough to handle the material. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "This movie holds so much truth; it cannot possibly be watched by anyone, man or woman who are or who have been in a serious relationship without any such crying at some point during it, or at least being strongly enough emotionally affected to do so. I cried. I cried before the opening credits song was more than a few lines in. It spoke to me like few movies have. It is the first movie about the subject of love that I&apos;ve watched since I became this involved, physically and emotionally with my wife-to-be. That alone makes the movie have an impact on me, good or not. That it dealt with a subject that has so recently become so important to me. A successful marriage. But while I was this into the film, while it had this impact on me... I can&apos;t claim that it was great. The performances are. The editing is. The script is. Most of the parts are. But somehow, the sum, it just doesn&apos;t add up to being that... great. It might be that the ending feels flat. It might be that the movie offers no answers, only observations. The movie goes back and forth between present day chaos/unhappiness and fond memories... these were particularly difficult to watch without crying. This works to the film&apos;s advantage and creates a sense of more than a non-linear time-line; a life-time, years upon years of memories returning to this old married couple. The story of two people who love each other... they do. They&apos;ve just tired of each other, of the differences, of the arguing. Comes very close to being great, but it just doesn&apos;t quite make it, I&apos;m afraid. Worth watching for any fans of the genre, and has plenty of insights to offer. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a serious relationship. 6/10",

      "name": "A very long set-up for the next movie, which is funny and engaging enough to pass the time but isn&apos;t really as hard-hittingly visceral as it ought to be.",
      "reviewBody": "Many years ago, pre-scandal director Jack Neo scored one of his hugest hits with I Not Stupid, a poignant, intelligent movie about the trials and tribulations (mostly trials) of growing up under Singapore&apos;s rigorous education system. That film remains my favourite local movie because it so wonderfully encapsulates the Singaporean experience: it&apos;s true to life, featuring characters and situations we will all recognise, and it boasts an awful lot of heart and home truths. I was hoping that Neo would make a long-awaited return to form with Ah Boys To Men, following a string of increasingly commercialistic films that have drawn flack for their shameless product placement.\n\nAs I Not Stupid did with our schools and students, Ah Boys has in its cross-hairs the National Service (NS) scheme that&apos;s been in place in our little island republic for forty-five years now. Joshua Tan plays Ken Chow, the spoiled scion of a wealthy family – and self- absorbed, vaguely ungrateful son to a father who just wants him to make the most of his time in NS (Liu Qianyi) and a desperately over- protective, indulgent mother who tries all ways and means to get her son off the proverbial hook (Irene Ang). When he&apos;s enlisted against his will, he meets his bunkmates: well-connected buddy &apos;Lobang&apos; (Wang Weiliang), ang mor pai aspiring officer-to-be Aloysius (Maxi Lim). But Ken just wants to be with his girlfriend, who&apos;s due to go overseas to study, and he starts plotting ways and means to get off his enforced sequestration on the training island of Pulau Tekong.\n\nHow does Neo&apos;s Ah Boys measure up to Michael Chiang&apos;s oft-revived play Army Daze? Ah Boys updates the circumstances in which the boys find themselves – so there&apos;s some talk of camera phones and the occasional use of Skype for not-so-romantic tête-a-têtes. But, strip that all away, and the two stories are broadly similar. Both feature a tongue-in-cheek look at the enlisting process, and then the training period – following a group of very different kids who start out as strangers but find that friendships can be bred in the (literal) trenches. Neither film is a fierce political statement decrying mandatory conscription. There is some mocking of the institution, but for the most part, NS is accepted as a fact of life, and celebrated as something that brings a mismatched group of boys together and forces them to become men.\n\nIn that sense, Neo&apos;s movie doesn&apos;t mean to be inoffensive though it may annoy some people with its largely benign, nostalgic depiction of a military stint that they personally didn&apos;t enjoy or value. There is a whiff of chest-thumping to this film that could prove annoying after a while: Ken&apos;s father is a lonely advocate for NS in the film, begging to be heard above the jokes that constitute the memories and narratives of those who look less charitably on the army – but he&apos;s presented as the voice of reason, the one who should be respected. It certainly doesn&apos;t help matters or impressions that the director received the Ministry of Defence&apos;s full cooperation in terms of loans of machinery, equipment, weaponry and access to Tekong although he firmly maintains that Mindef did not invest in the project.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say Neo&apos;s depiction of NS and a possible war-time scenario don&apos;t impress on occasion. They do – any young man will recognise the days when they were hazed mercilessly by their platoon sergeants, and forced to drop twenty for insolence or disobedience. My favourite parts of the film are probably the nostalgia-tinged flashback segments that are scattered throughout: Ken&apos;s uncle reminisces about his time in the army, when hazing was twenty times worse, and those moments serve as funny, surprisingly sweet counterpoints to our more regulated, modern times.\n\nAs for the vaunted war-time scenario – for which Neo famously scored special permission to shut off parts of the busy business district – it&apos;s fun enough to watch, and the CGI doesn&apos;t look too bad (though it looks rather too shiny and perfect to be quite real). It serves as a framing device for the rest of the film: it&apos;s intended to drive home the real stakes our army boys are playing for, that there might well be blood and death and sacrifice in their futures, however impossible that appears in the safety of their bunks and the lack of a military threat against Singapore. The concept works well enough – but the execution leaves a little to be desired when it becomes clear that the blood, bombs and destruction were less serious simulation and more silly game-play.\n\nAs for what can be expected from the rest of the film: Neo goes into it with his standard bag of film-making tricks. His humour is sly and subversive, but only a little bit so; his characters manage that difficult trick of being both caricatures and real people; and he crafts sneaky emotional hooks into his stories which would cynically be called emotionally manipulative. Ken, Lobang, Aloysius and even Ken&apos;s parents come close to being stereotypes we&apos;ve seen before, but their concerns still come through in a way that&apos;s occasionally affecting.\n\nFor anyone who&apos;s watched a Jack Neo movie or two, there are two possible ways to respond to Ah Boys: it could be a comfortingly familiar experience, as it feels just exactly like the kind of movie he&apos;s made many times before. It even hits some of the same far-reaching emotional notes as I Not Stupid, reminding every boy of his own experience with NS (whether it lies behind or ahead of him) while every girl will have known someone who&apos;s enlisted. The other way lies frustration: annoyance that Neo is pulling the same old cards out of his sleeve, for a movie that&apos;s bloated with padding so that he can slice off another two hours to make the sequel (which follows in February next year).",

Of course it does not have high production value, but as far as content and story-line are concerned it is awesome.\n\nThe film captivated me with its alluring plot and horror filled moments. Christopher Allport is wonderful in the role of &apos;Mother&apos; Nicky, especially when he shows his true nature in the bar scene.\n\nUnfortunately this film is very rare. I was lucky enough to find a copy at a local video store that was going out of business so I picked it up. If you ever find this film to buy or rent take advantage of it and you will not be sorry. It is a good film to watch with your friends, and like the last contributor mentioned, watching it with your girlfriend. She will be so scared that she won&apos;t want to let go of you.\n\nI love this movie so much that my friends and I created our own sequel of sorts a few years ago via our camcorder. Granted we are not very good actors and we didn&apos;t take much time to plan anything, it is still fun to watch.\n\nLong live Savage Weekend, it rocks!"

      "reviewBody": "I always liked Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy, so I thought, in case the movie is worth nothing, I&apos;d still get to see some friendly faces. For better or worse, I can say it was about what I expected.\n\nI put this movie in two categories, and I think I placed it right: it&apos;s a decent comedy, with parts attempting to live up to an action movie. At its heart though it tries to be comedic and funny, so that&apos;s upon what it should be judged. Thankfully, you will get the chance to laugh out loud, but unfortunately not as much as you&apos;d like to laugh out loud at a comedy. I won&apos;t even mention rolling on the floor. \n\nThe story isn&apos;t something really new, but it has quite a few humorous plot twists. The so-called funny character is Kelly, who really inflicts a fair amount of pain on his adversaries, but he is just such a nicely drawn, egocentric guy, that it actually works on a comedic level. It&apos;s always just about him, and him and then some more. \n\nThe actors have their charm but I won&apos;t really dwell on this as they are as high profile as it gets, Hollywood style, so you know what you get. Perhaps Wilson could have spiced up his game with a bit of the unexpected, but all in all he does what he does best.\n\nI did feel a bit let down by the special effects, with some flimsy looking explosions placed here and there. However, the host city of Budapest looked really gorgeous throughout, making it well worth it&apos;s money shots.\n\nTo draw the line, the film isn&apos;t great, but it&apos;s fine enough. No brilliant ideas, or anything like that, just the usual comic stuff.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Enki Bilal is a supremely skilled comic book artist from the same stylistic school as Moebius (who influenced the visual style of Blade Runner and designed part of Alien).\n\nBilal&apos;s comics are invariably sombre, textured, exquisitely drawn worlds with strong internal logic.\n\n&quot;Immortel&quot; is the film adaptation of the &quot;Nikopol&quot; trilogy of comics by Bilal. This trilogy of comics I highly recommend.\n\nThe film opens with some lovely CGI sequences: Nice environment and craft - gritty, textured, dystopia, a catchy steam punk take on the Blade Runner aesthetic.\n\nThe main characters work well in this setting, especially the fetchingly beautiful Linda Hardy (a former Miss France).\n\nBut without warning the quality drops jarringly -- as a host of secondary CGI characters are introduced.\n\nWhat you thought was a movie, suddenly turns into something resembling a video game cut-scene: The amateurishly animated, dated CGI characters would be booed out of Tron. The voice acting is awful. The lip sync a joke.\n\nTo really grind it in, the CGI actors get lots of close-ups. Painful.\n\nThe plot progresses through a series of surreal events in a New York of the future. If you haven&apos;t read the comic, things won&apos;t make too much sense on first viewing.\n\nStick around for the ride, for there are a number of very successful scenes in this movie -- a hauntingly beautiful museum sequence, some fine sci-fi thrills, a gritty symbolist apartment in which a dreamlike love story takes place. Atmospheric music, too.\n\nThe really good stuff is invariably bookended by poor scenes, including the worst CGI explosions you&apos;ll ever see, awful dialog, and tinny sound effects that suddenly intrude on an otherwise coherent sound design.\n\nThis has got to be most uneven movie I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nBut give the comic books a go."

The race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a pale reflection today&apos;s F1 is of this once great sport, and what great characters we have lost...\n\nA real must see movie",

      "reviewBody": "For this documentary, Ruth Beckermann entered an exhibition about war crimes in Vienna 1995 with her camera team. She recorded the opinions of the visitors, mostly former soldiers, some of them admitting that they had seen similar scenes themselves, and condemning them, others denying any connection, and still others even justifying the war. In this way an authentic picture emerges about how the former soldiers viewed their own involvement, and beyond that, how Austrian society at large viewed the Second World War in the late 1990s. The Austrian situation is interesting in that Austria, unlike Germany, was able to present themselves mainly as victims, and did not take responsibility or undergo the same kind of re-education as Germany. Now, in the early 2020s, mostly everyone interviewed in the film will already be dead. This makes one realize even more how precious the voices of real people experiencing that time, and how precious documentaries like this one are.",

      "reviewBody": "This is what they used to do every year in Paris, to celebrate their National Day (Bastille Day), the 14th of July. In thousands of streets all over the city, lights would be strung up, bunting would appear, French flags however small would protrude from windows. And for the nights of the 13th, 14th, and 15th, they would dance to small bands in the streets all night long, sometimes drinking continuously and not sleeping at all for the whole of that time. One reads about it in the books and memoirs of the period. Not that I ever saw it myself, of course, nor is there I suppose anyone alive today who can say he or she really did it. It was one of the many aspects of Paris life which died with the Nazi invasion in 1940 and never came back. But here it is, in all its glory, a whole film of it, directed by the inimitable René Clair. There are several laugh out loud moments in this film, and many tragic ones as well. Clair portrays a tapestry of life as it was lived in the streets at that time, with the naughty urchins laughing and running about with no traffic to deter them, the flower girls, the arguing taxi drivers, the snobs, the poe-faced matrons, the wicked concierges, the cleaners, the café owners, the bar girls, and the Apaches who are stealing wallets and getting up to no good. People laugh, people cry, hearts are broken, and then mended again. The beautiful Annabelle plays the character Anna with great charm. She starred in so many notable films, not least the great classic HOTEL DU NORD (1938, see my review). As is usually the case, Clair over-does the music on the sound track, like someone putting far too much icing on a cake which is already sweet enough. But then, who can complain of such a small fault when this is a film so delightful, amusing and full of life and charm? And by watching it we can see the lost pleasures and pain of the celebrating Paris crowds of yesteryear dancing the nights away in their annual Gallic carnival atmosphere of gaiety and innocent abandon, an era of simple pleasures which shall never come again.",

I recall the film &quot;Challenge to be Free&quot;; Both main characters hide away and become &quot;One with Nature&quot;.I do enjoy stories about Friendship, working together and Grizzly Adams is a very sweet,and wholesome show. The viewer learns about Teamwork,compromise and respecting the great gifts of the World that God gave us."

His &quot;Poil de carotte&quot;, which I saw on French Ontario television tonight, is not only an immortal classic for its interpretation by a ten year old Robert Lynen, but also for its script, its photography - which didn&apos;t age at all since 1932 -, its sound and music and its general air of realism. It&apos;s about the suffering of unloved children. As such, it is certainly one of the inspirations behind Kubrick&apos;s and Spielberg&apos;s &quot;A.I.&quot;. Many directors have borrowed from this film, notably Robert Bresson in &quot;Mouchette&quot; and Walt Disney in &quot;Cinderella&quot; (the scene where the wicked stepmother - here, the hero&apos;s real mother - sneaks up behind Cinderella to lock her up in her room)."

Also the directing, very amateurish, fails to create one single memorable scene - all the dramatic situations being common, predictable and childish. The actors are very poorly directed, so they play theatrically, demonstratively and with grandiloquent mannerisms - which is understandable, since Radu Gabrea is one of the so-called &quot;middle aged dinosaurs&quot; of Romanian cinema: the &apos;70s generation, today deeply afflicted by obsoleteness.\n\nThe saddest thing of all is that, although dealing with the traumatic events surrounding the tragedy of an ethnic minority in the dark years of World War 2, &quot;The Beheaded Rooster&quot; remains devoid of any emotion. Since the author is definitely a very sensitive and feeling artist, we are led to conclude that the failure is caused simply by his professional awkwardness - which is a great pity indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "Preston Sturges&apos; directing debut is a smash as he cleverly shows how even back in &quot;the good old days,&quot; politics were as cruel and crooked as ever. The acting is pretty solid here, especially the leads, but the real point here is the story that Sturges has put together. Here, we see a simple man who does what he is told and almost immediately is made governor of the state. This shows that America is the land of opportunity as well as the land of corruption. What amazes me is how fluidly the film moves. It is only 82 minutes long, yet more happens here than in most Disney family movies. This shows the wonderful genius of Sturges and how he was able to enjoy a successful career throughout the 1940s. A very underrated and unknown film, this is a perfect gem about our not-so perfect government.",

      "reviewBody": "A slight, eventually monotonous fable that is frequently very very funny. Its use of the medium may be rudimentary, and its general conceit - an old woman is a real pain to her family - hardly complex, but there is a real pleasure in seeing sheer, unwarranted nastiness in action.  Tatie Danielle is the kind of wearingly negative OAP we all hope we&apos;ll grow up into.\n\nThe movie starts with Danielle being generally unpleasant to her equally elderly servant-companion, Odile, in a monstrous parody of the Barbie/Mabel relationship in THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN.  They share a large house outside Paris - Odile doing all the chores to a chorus of ingratitude and hostility; Danielle accusing her of senility and thieving .  A short visit from her nephew, Jean-Pierre&apos;s family, inspires in Danielle the desire to live with them in Paris, and fortuitously (or is it?) Odile meets with a fatal accident cleaning the chandelier on a rickety chair.  Danielle sells her house, shares the money with her nephew and spinster niece, Jeanne, to ensure moving in with the former.\n\nHere, she is an absolute horror, refusing to eat at dinner, insulting Jean-Pierre&apos;s wife, Catherine&apos;s cooking and looks, kicking the dog, deliberately losing the youngest child in the park.  The family refuse to believe she is mean because of her financial generosity, but the barrage begins to wear.  Just before they intend to holiday in Greece, with Danielle staying with Jeanne, the latter is dumped by her boyfriend when she announces her pregnancy; Jean-Pierre suggests she accompany them: a helper must be found for Danielle.\n\nOutraged, Danielle ups her offensive.  She begins to overeat to get sick, and throws water on the bed, feigning wetting.  In a brilliantly farcical sequence, she disrupts her nephew&apos;s dinner with friends by turning on the TV at a blaring volume, begging for food and visibly defecating in her nightie. Eventually the family find a minder, Sandrine, and set off.  But Sandrine refuses to take any nonsense, and after a power struggle and touching thawing , leaves Danielle to spend a last night with her American boyfriend. Left alone, Danielle deteriorates, lets the apartment go to pot, and sets it on fire.  A national outrage ensues over this perceived abandonment and Danielle becomes a celebrity, while the family are taken to court for negligence.  Her fraud is revealed, though, and she ends up in an old folks&apos; home...\n\nTATIE is very reminiscent of Renoir&apos;s masterpiece BOUDU SAUVE DES EAUX, in which a tramp rescued by a kindly bourgeois wreaks havoc on his benefactor. Danielle, for all her unpleasantness, is a subversive presence, disrupting complacent bourgeois domesticity, telling hard truths.  The family aren&apos;t vile money-grabbers, and despite some grotesqueness, are an essentially decent lot.  They are the new France, boasting shiny apartments with all mod cons, and bright colour schemes, tolerant liberal attitudes (one son is a gay dancer), dinner parties, trips to Greece.  Their only crimes are pretentiousness, homogeneity (note the similarity of their names), and self satisfaction, but they are hardly Bunuellian monsters.\n\nDanielle is the France they&apos;d like to forget, reminder of a colonialist and collaborationist past.  Her childlessness is linked to sterility and the pinched nature of her character; her husband died 50 years ago, just before the Fall of France?  He is a seeming image of French glory and military prowess undermined by his comic looks.  She is a past that refuses to be suppressed and her power reveals the fragility and superficiality of bright, modern, consumerist France, how easily it can descend into chaos and fragmentation.  Catherine becomes a bag of nerves, Jean-Pierre convenes Mafia-like meetings to discuss family crises.\n\nTATIE is very brave in never selling out on the character of Danielle, who, in Hollywood, would surely be reduced to mush.  There is as much ridicule as pathos in her conversation with her dead husband, and her growing affection for the only character who won&apos;t cow before her is disabled by a lack of human sympathy and insight.  We love Danielle precisely because she is so unbearable, a vile Id that cannot be swept away.  \n\nTsilla Chelton&apos;s sublime performance, a mixture of evil, moroseness, regret and childish mischief, keeps the film watchable, although by the end one has probably had enough.  The coda is delightful, though, rejecting cosy ideas of moral regeneracy.  The style is more subtle than it first appears, with its plays of light and space serving to suffocate Danielle in her environment, and there are some pleasant, if conventionally mild, surreal long shots, involving an adorable, soon-to-be-betrayed dog.",

      "reviewBody": "I was given this film on DVD as a birthday present, so sat down and gave it a go. I had seen a few of the other Doctor films and thought them gentle, inoffensive but ultimately unfunny. This one is very similar.\n\nJames Robertson Justice&apos;s irritable surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt is the central character, with Dirk Bogarde as Dr Stephen Sparrow hovering about. It&apos;s really James Robertson Justice&apos;s performance that makes this film, with his wonderful fruity bark, and seeing him given the chance to show off other sides of his acting ability, coming over as a rather affable chap now and again.\n\nLike a lot of these British comedy films, the plot is wafer-thin, you really have to suspend your disbelief, and ultimately it isn&apos;t really very funny at all.\n\nBut for me I came away with a satisfied smile on my face, having enjoyed the film for other reasons. The supporting cast is a real who&apos;s who of British screen acting, with people like Timothy Bateson, John Bluthal, Donald Houston and many others. Being a fan of Flanders and Swan, it was a nice surprise to see Michael Flanders as the food writer at the health farm.\n\nMy favourite scene is at the railway station, where rail buffs can ooh and ahh at British Railways-era carriages and locos, the history buffs at the posters for milk and rail rovers. There&apos;s also lots of street shots full of classic British cars, black-and-white striped sign posts and cafés where you can get beans on toast for 10d and fried egg, beans, chips and fried bread for the princely sum of 2/6! Not a great film, you sometimes find yourself pushing the fast forward button. But for James Robertson Justice, and as a kind of time capsule of early 60s Britain it&apos;s perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "As a Catholic/Christian publisher I did not expect the integrity that the movie The Nativity Story presents. The story is produced with good taste and careful thought. At times the Scripture may be bent but it is never broken. The bends are simply to aid in the visual telling of the story and are not offensive.\n\nI found it to be very good family viewing with minimal violence and the scenes were not graphic in nature. The lesson in family love alone is worth the price of a ticket. The bonus is the lesson in faith and trust in God. I would encourage you to take children of all ages.\n\nThe theology should be acceptable to all Christians. However, I did talk to one priest that had a problem with the childbirth scene. He subscribes to the theology that Mary&apos;s childbirth was not painful. I understand his theology but I disagree with it on the grounds of Jesus and Mary&apos;s humanity. Also the arrival of the Wise Men at the time of the birth though not correct does not hurt the story. Still I feel that these small problems would be a poor and unjust reason not to see, or tell others not to see this movie.\n\nOf all the versions of this story that have been done I found it to be the most inspiring and visually the most tastefully done. At last we have a great family movie that puts Christ back into Christmas.\n\nExecutive Director Contemplation Corner Press",

      "reviewBody": "Though now known as &quot;Episode IV-A New Hope,&quot; for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in &apos;77, this will always be the first &quot;Star Wars.&quot; We will always think of it as just &quot;Star Wars&quot; - plain &amp; simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old &apos;Ben&apos;), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO &amp; R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you&apos;d seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn&apos;t possible. But they&apos;d been there before in our minds. We&apos;d read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We&apos;d dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from 1956 came close, and then there were the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate &apos;em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.\n\nI remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I&apos;d been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn&apos;t disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can&apos;t wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just &apos;movie.&apos; You can&apos;t wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It&apos;s a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; is superior - I must disagree).\n\nThe one character you really can&apos;t wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can&apos;t wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he&apos;s simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He&apos;s at his best here where there&apos;s still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.\n\nThis was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it&apos;s this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began &amp; ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he&apos;s perfect in the role. Fisher&apos;s main surprise is that she&apos;s not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...",

But, as far a movie can go, I now use it with my students to show them ALL the things you shouldn&apos;t do! And that&apos;s pretty difficult. So, just let me add this: camera angles, lighting, plot, music, acting and directorial skills are nonexistent. What about that? It&apos;s a class in itself and I doubt anyone will ever make anything as bad... ever!\n\nThink about TV and film production. How much money did they spend in lighting this film... a lot! just because they wanted it to happen at night. But... night? It just comes and goes no matter the time of day!\n\nIt&apos;s amazing how much money you can spend and how badly your product will come out. What I can&apos;t believe is that it made it to a DVD release. Who paid for this? If I was the writer or director or producer, I&apos;d never dare to risk my neck!",

Happy ending belies the fact that seven decades later the abhorrent practice still occurs.\n\nNew faces in the cast include Vera Miles as an innocent heroine and Kathleen Hughes as a sort of junior varsity femme fatale. She is posed sexily in the advertising and marketing of the movie, strictly phony since her role on screen is relatively tame.\n\nAs a preachy hero, Henreid is too good to be true, and the severity of the hazing is not graphic enough to qualify for the trashy content one expects for exploitation cinema. A far better, more serious treatment came decades later in &quot;Fraternity Row&quot;."

It&apos;s a little shorter than an episode, but being that the jabs at the film are hysterically funny, it evens out. Now, I heard that making the film wasn&apos;t fun for the crew, as producers made the cast change lines and many other things, but you&apos;d never know it from watching it. It&apos;s also very interesting to see more of the ship, and see things in a broader way, due to a bigger budget. This ranks up there with the best episodes, and I&apos;ve been quoting it repeatedly since seeing it, so many years ago. For me, as a fan, this was worth all the effort and frustrations the crew went through, I truly enjoy it and appreciate it!",

On the plus side, is an interesting plot to flood a South African gold mine, which would cut world production by 30%, and drive up the price of gold. Moore&apos;s heroic attempt to save the flooding mine and save 1000 trapped men provides plenty of excitement. .................. - MERK",

Well, the movie isn&apos;t as bad as I expected. It&apos;s all to clear that the director&apos;s first thought wasn&apos;t about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different. \n\nThanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don&apos;t expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see. \n\nI guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon. It&apos;s certainly not an intellectual movie, but I didn&apos;t mind about that when watching it. I give it a 6,5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "A year after The Mountain of the Cannibal God, Sergio Martino decided to go back into the jungle - although instead of bloodthirsty cannibals, this time he brought with him a ridiculous looking fake crocodile! The influence from this film obviously came primarily from Steven Spielberg&apos;s Jaws (which was a big hit among Italian film directors in the seventies), with a bit of the cannibal sub-genre thrown in for good measure. It&apos;s safe to say that this film isn&apos;t very good - and has nothing on Sergio Martino&apos;s more successful films (his Giallo&apos;s in particular), but at least the film is fun enough for most of the duration. The plot revolves around a legendary crocodile that lives near a tourist resort in Africa. Unfortunately, the over-sized crocodile is not pleased about the tourists&apos; intrusion and so takes it upon itself to kill everyone! On the land, the natives believe that they are being killed by the tourists and so they take to the lake in a boat...but in the lake, the hungry crocodile awaits them! \n\nOf Martino&apos;s three jungle movies (the other two being The Mountain of the Cannibal God and Island of the Fish Men), this one is definitely the weakest, although it&apos;s not all bad news as it&apos;s still entertaining enough. Naturally, the crocodile looks completely ridiculous but this adds charm to the film and I&apos;d rather see a silly looking and obviously fake crocodile terrorising people than a CGI one. Unlike Martino&apos;s other films, this one doesn&apos;t feature much in the way of gore, nudity or sleaze which is a shame as I would have preferred more of all three. Like Island of the Fish Men, this film stars Barbara Bach and again she looks absolutely great. Her co-star is Claudio Cassinelli (also from Island of the Fish Men, as well as Mountain of the Cannibal God) and he looks the part as the rugged male lead. The scenery is good and the film is obviously shot on location, which helps Sergio Martino to build the atmosphere surrounding the &quot;mythical&quot; central monster. Overall, The Big Alligator River is silly and fairly poor quality, but it&apos;s a fun viewing and therefore isn&apos;t all bad.",

Anthony Wong gives what is probably his best performance; Michael Wong isn&apos;t annoying at all for once, and the supporting cast is generally good.  There basically isn&apos;t a boring scene in the whole movie.  While it&apos;s not really an action movie, there are a fair number of chaotic violent scenes... Sometimes the camerawork is a little TOO chaotic.  It might seem pretentious in other movies, but this one has a such a &quot;what the hell&quot; attitude I&apos;m inclined to overlook some erratic storytelling and pointlessly strange cinematography. It&apos;s hard to explain just what&apos;s so great about this movie, but I&apos;ve seen it three times and liked it more each time... That should say something."

      "reviewBody": "Okay, so.... Godzilla vs Hedorah! It&apos;s been said that this is a Godzilla movie you either love or hate, so it&apos;s either a 10 or a 0. For me personally, this movie is a 5; right smack dab in the middle! It&apos;s not a shining gem or a smouldering turd, it&apos;s just kinda &quot;eh&quot; *gesture where you shake your hand with all the fingers flat out*\n\nSo, the premise; rampant water and air pollution has spawned Hedorah, a sentient monster made of pollution that is like a mix of the Blob and a garbage dump! Hedorah is able to melt people to bones! The only hope for humanity, as always, is GODZILLAAAAA~!!!!\n\nHedorah is a notable monster as he is the last monster of the Showa era that is acting on his own will, he isn&apos;t obeying anyone or under mind control, unlike Ghidorah, Gigan, Megalon, Mechagodzilla, and Titanosaurus of the succeeding Showa films.\n\nThis movie is different; there&apos;s bizarre animation, trippy montages, and drug innuendos a-plenty!!! Now, the animation shown isn&apos;t anime, it&apos;s just some bizarre animation straight out of Uncanny Valley. Hedorah is shown sucking on a smokestack from a factory and exhaling the smoke before showing his bloodshot eyes, a blatant reference to taking a bong hit.\n\nAs someone who has taken a few bong hits before, I found this to be a clever little thing. The drug innuendos can be excused because this movie was made in 1971; weed culture was still in it&apos;s very huge first run!\n\nThere are two or three POV shots from Hedorah&apos;s perspective.\n\nAlso, no review of Godzilla vs Hedorah would be complete without mentioning the bizarre scene where Godzilla FLIES. This was a total WTF moment.\n\nAll in all, if you watch this movie with a sober mind like I did, you&apos;ll either hate it or it&apos;ll just be &quot;eh&quot;. If you watch it after smoking some weed or ingesting an edible, it&apos;ll be the best damn Godzilla movie you&apos;ve ever seen!",

The actors are obviously trying but the writer/director just doesn&apos;t deliver which completely throws off the intentions of each character. What I mean is, it&apos;s bad enough that the music is astonishingly boring, but that no character is given any development makes the movie even worse. Therefore Gwyneth Paltrow comes off as whiny because why she started drinking is never explained, Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester appear pretentious because they have no history to explain their on-off minor rivalry, and Tim McGraw appears to just be bossy because there&apos;s no push for him to make Gwyneth Paltrow&apos;s character a more popular star. I feel no sympathy for the characters because there is no real story behind any of them which makes the long scenes feel even longer. When something thin is being stretched out beyond it&apos;s limit, it shows by either becoming looser or ripping apart. This movie doesn&apos;t completely rip apart, but it comes terribly close (emphasis on &quot;terrible&quot;). I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially country music fans."

When Max said 14 or fight, I believed him. Of course at 17 I couldn&apos;t vote but I was facing 18 and at that time the Vietnam draft. Scary times indeed. Just the other night it was on TMC and I recorded it. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen it anywhere since. It was fun to watch it again, Shelly Winters looked really young, Ed Begley was perfect as the stoned out old Senator and Christopher Jones, going from rock star to politician to President and then to &quot;old guy&quot; played the part to a tee. The only thing about this movie I didn&apos;t care for was that it type casted Jones and he really didn&apos;t do much after this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Valentine has a great premise.  It takes all that Halloween stood for and tries to update it.  It fails of course, but you have to give it full marks for trying.  Where as a lot of films try to be original and fail at that as well, at least you can say that there is a masked killer in this film, he is incredibly strong, he walks and still catches his victims as they run and he finds original and quite disgusting ways of disposing of his victims.  So I give the film credit for trying.  But like most other films that have tried to follow in Screams footsteps, it does fail quite miserably.\n\nValentine is a story about a geeky kid that just wants to be accepted in the sixth grade.  He is at a dance and asks all the pretty girls to dance and they all say no.  Some of them are disgustingly mean to him and tell him that they would rather be boiled alive than to dance with him ( guess how that character dies? ).  Then one heavy set girl decides she will make out with him and then when all the popular guys catch her doing it, she says that he forced himself on her and they beat the tar out of him and he is sent to reform school.  That is the beginning and it is well done.  It sets up the killer on the loose with a revenge plot quite nicely.  We of course skip ahead about 15 years and we have beautiful women in college lined up to be slaughtered.  The opening death is extremely laughable but has its moments of nice touches and subtle homages to films like Halloween.  It is worth mentioning how the first woman is killed because it is a lesson in horror mythology of all the wrong things to do to attract a killer on the loose on a college campus.\n\nA young woman just comes back from a disasterous date and decides that she is going to go do an autopsy at 11 o clock at night.  Then to top it off, she is wearing a flimsy tank top, has large breasts and she decides to keep the lights off in the autopsy room, because, well you know, you don&apos;t need light to disect a human being.  I started to ask myself why she was allowed to disect a corpse with no supervision this late and with no lights on seeing as she was only a med student.  Horror movies are always filled with silly situations ( Friday the 13th&apos;s, no one wipes after they are finished in the bathroom, people always go to investigate noises and so on ) but this is one of the sillier ones.  Then when she is grabbed by the corpse, instead of leaving, she stays in the room to see who it is.  And then when the things chases her, she doesn&apos;t go for the door, she tries to hide in the other rooms.  DUMB! DUMB! DUMB!\n\nFiguring out who the killer is is fun, I must admit and they do a good job of concealing his identity until the end so you have to give it credit for that as well.  But this is not really a scary film and it is not even a well done film.  It had it&apos;s moments but when it leaves the theater, no one will really remember anything about it.  Nothing really jumps out at you.   I think Jamie Blanks has an idea of what it takes to scare an audience, he has probably tried to emulate many of the greats like Raimi, Hitchcock and Carpenter, but he can&apos;t quite seem to hit the perfect note.  Maybe if he keeps trying he will get it because there are scenes in here that are close to perfection but then they end too abruptly or without the proper pay off. That is what made Halloween so elusive in it&apos;s brilliance.  The pay off was so horrific and so perfect that to try to duplicate it is almost unfathomable.  Valentine comes close but ultimately fails.\n\nThis is not as bad as some horror out there but it is not in the same league as some of the new horror films that have made audiences embrace horror again.  Sixth Sense, Blair Witch, Stir Of Echoes, The Gift are all pretty good films.  Valentine is on the brink.\n\n6 out of 10",

I think Black heaven is an interesting different movie, it is fun, it is clever at parts and is well done, ironically it is still a bit naive even during its darkest moments."

      "reviewBody": "Jack (Ben Affleck) is a hotshot and thriving writers agent in Hollywood. He built his company from the bottom up and has a fine crew of folks working for him, too. Not only this, he lives in a gorgeous house in Malibu and is married to a beautiful lady, Nina (Rebecca Romjim). Also in the house is Jack&apos;s father (Howard Hesseman) who has had a stroke and is subject to bizarre behaviors. Surprisingly, Jack is not happy and signs up for a nighttime writing class taught by a stuffy Brit (John Cleese). There, he is told to start a journal, which will not only improve his writing but will give clues to his psychological needs and wants. Reluctantly, Jack does this. But, there are pitfalls ahead. A former classmate, who knows Jack is very famous, has sent ten screenplays written by his girlfriend (Bai Ling) for Jack&apos;s evaluation and has never gotten a reply. Now, this man is out for revenge. He breaks into Jack&apos;s house and beats up the agent, while taking the diary. Since the perp&apos;s gal works for a minor newspaper, the rag is about to print Jacks every secrets. Also, there is trouble between Jack and Nina, deep trouble. How will Jack work his way out of this crisis? Despite the fine, fine cast, which also includes Gina Gershon, Mike Binder, Kal Penn, Adam Goldberg, and Jerry O&apos;Connell, in addition to the ones listed above, this film is a big flop and a big mess. Oh, there are a few funny scenes, like Jack and his crew faking karate stances across from the employees of a Chinese restaurant who are doing the real moves! Also, Ling is pretty funny as the evil lady of blackmail. Yet, the movie is, in this viewers opinion, totally pointless. Especially surprising is the ending, where romance burnt to a crisp might still rekindle. Affleck is one of my favorite actors and this is his worst film, worse than Gigli. Thank God he went on to true glory with Argo, State of Play, and many other fine flicks. As for this one, avoid it by a wide mile.",

So the film loses weight thereby, which it attempts to replace with th humor and humanity of Humberto Almazán&apos;s performance - and it almost succeeds, he is eminently likable as a grass-roots padre.\n\nIt&apos;s not a bad film, not an uninteresting film. I just kept getting haunted by flashbacks to the Ford original, with it&apos;s high-contrast shadows, and tense moments of confrontation between the priest, his own conscience, and the wannabe atheist soldier. Despite the clarity of the priest&apos;s commitment in this version, the original actually carried the message better.",

Words are my business...having owned and directed my own language schools for 35 years. But when I sat down to write this, immediately after viewing &quot;The Class&quot;, my unmitigated ire and unbridled outrage only produced that most dreaded of conditions, anathema to all reviewers: Writer&apos;s Block!\n\nSeveral hours later, my blood having assuaged itself from boiling to simmer, I find myself, once again, anxious to share my impressions of this undeniably unique French film with you.\n\n&quot;Class&quot; refuses to be pigeon-holed. Perhaps a Documentary-Drama fusion, but not really a Docudrama, either. More akin to reality TV,... only better! &quot;Class&quot; will certainly affect different people in strikingly different ways!\n\nHow do middle-school teachers around the world maintain their grip on sanity and reality? I felt myself sliding down the slippery slope from just observing these French* kids flaunt their world-class insolence! But whatever your reaction to them, chances are &quot;Class&quot; will get to you just like running your fingernails along a blackboard!\n\nDid you notice the asterisk on French* Kids? Surprisingly, this inner-city French classroom was a veritable rainbow coalition: Africans, Caribbean Franco-Africans, Arabs, Eastern Europeans, a couple Hispanics and Chinese. Oh yes, and even some Gauls, born and raised! My spoken French is decrepit, but my ear is still fairly well-tuned and a myriad of different accents were very easy to discern, a few of them rendered somewhat haltingly.!\n\nEncountering harmony and a real-time teaching classroom dynamic under these conditions pose a daunting challenge, to say the least. The problem resides in that 9th graders around the world are keenly aware of who REALLY is in control in the classroom.... They are!\n\nMore often than not, their classroom comportment is an unabated and blatant non-stop provocation of whoever is teaching them. But God forbid should that teacher lapse into a single moment of normal human reaction to such constant torment! The unspoken undercurrent that is dissolving the foundations of education around the world is only too self-evident in this &quot;Class&quot;. Just a few accusatory words from any student could instantly vaporize the career of any teacher!\n\nFrancois, the real-life teacher exhibiting patience that would make Job look bi-polar in comparison, manages to defy expectation and give us an unprecedented surprise ending; apparently there IS something that most students still fear! Recommended to all teachers and anyone interested in the teaching process! 9*********\n\nENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!",

Lew Landers was a big provider of such stuff, and those movies were not that bad, if you keep in mind that they all were propaganda. This one is interesting for those who have never heard nor seen any propaganda films of this period. But for those old timers like me who have seen so many of them...Bruce Bennet often played Nazis in war films of the forties."

      "reviewBody": "The Incredible Petrified World (1959) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nA scientist (John Carradine) creates a diving bell that will allow him to try and get a better understanding of the ocean. On its trial run he lowers it (and several people) into the ocean but it breaks free and falls to the bottom of the ocean. He fears that everyone is dead but in fact they are alive and find a cave that has a strange form of life.\n\nIf you read the reviews for this Jerry Warren film you&apos;ll see many of them calling this one of the worst movie ever made. I very much disagree with that and in fact, for a Warren film, it&apos;s actually pretty good. This here was the second film he directed after his debut MAN BEAST and in all honesty these two are the best that he ever would make. I&apos;ve seen all of the films that Warren directed so perhaps that&apos;s why I feel this one here is pretty good considering where he would go from here.\n\nObviously he was working on a very low-budget so instead of any real monsters or special effects we&apos;re treated to various bits of stock footage. This was obvious during the opening where the narrator is babbling on about stuff that has nothing to do with what we&apos;re seeing! From here the film continues to show its low-budget as we&apos;re told about the various dangers facing the people but we never actually see it. Instead we basically watch the actors sit around and talk about various bad things that could happen.\n\nAgain, there&apos;s nothing remotely special about this film but at the same time there&apos;s no question that the movie is mildly entertaining if you&apos;ve just got 66-minutes to kill and want to watch something mindless and rather pointless. For the most part Carradine and Clarke are both fun to watch and the rest of the supporting players at least hit their marks (there&apos;s a compliment). \n\nTHE INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD features nothing scary or even good for that matter. It&apos;s a low-budget movie that probably played third or fourth at local drive-ins so go in with that in mind and you might have some mild entertainment."

Traveling by tram one day, he witnesses the sudden death, by heart attack, of a man his own age. The event shocks him into the realization that his own days might be numbered, and he becomes determined to make the most of the time he has left. Quitting his job, he sets out with enthusiasm to enjoy the finer things in life, but the effort only leaves him dispirited and disillusioned.",

      "reviewBody": "This (surprisingly) consistently funny spoof of the Tarzan jungle epics from the &quot;Carry On&quot; gang is one of their better efforts I&apos;ve watched so far: the rude, crude jokes come flying by with a welcome regularity and the old reliables - Sidney James (as boozing big game hunter Bill Boosey), Joan Sims (as an aristocratic lady who lost her husband and son in Africa many years earlier) and Charles Hawtrey (as the latter&apos;s husband who has spent his time in Africa lording it over a bevy of jungle girls) - enter gleefully into the spirit of the thing; the same goes for occasional participants in the series who join them here like Frankie Howerd (as the improbable leader of the expedition), Kenneth Connor (as a lecherous botanist) and Bernard Bresslaw (as the native guide).\n\nAmong the comic highlights are a snake sliding into Ms. Sims&apos; undergarments at dinner-time (which she mistakes for the attentions of each of her male pretenders), the various bedtime romps which also involve Sims&apos; son (the Tarzan figure) and a huge gorilla, James&apos; shotgun &apos;standing up&apos; at attention on seeing Sims taking a bath, Tarzan&apos;s various catastrophic attempts at leaping from one tree to another, his learning the English language and numeric system (which invariably stops at number 6, since he mistakes it for &apos;sex&apos;), etc. The second half with Hawtrey sags slightly and the luscious Valerie Leon is not put to best advantage; amusingly, during this section, whenever our heroes are in peril, a classic musical cue from the 1960s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series is heard on the soundtrack! All in all, as I said earlier, the result is generally engaging and quite enjoyable.",

To my dismay I must admit that other actors are not very good, most of them cant be seen very often in good movies (Ok, M.Donutil is very good). But doesn&apos;t matter. The film shows a story about sudden getting huge amount of money, unexpectedly inherited. This event makes up the main plot. I recommend that movie to everybody. Im sure that kind of that humor is versatile, suitable for everybody. This movie means a lot for Czechs or Slovaks, they consider it to be a cult one. It has not been probably overcome by any other Czech or Slovak comedy. I can say thats also a challenge for (mainly) Slovak cinematography, which gets stuck last couple of years.",

      "reviewBody": "The poet Rilke said, &quot;There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms; from out of a silent crevice an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence.&quot; The unknowing weed takes its time to sing but sing it does in director Tran Anh Hung&apos;s film Norwegian Wood, his first since Vertical Ray of the Sun in 2000. Based on the best-selling 1987 novel of Haruki Murikami (which I haven&apos;t read), the film reflects the inner journey of 19-year-old Toru Watanabe (Ken&apos;ichi Matsuyama), a journey that embodies the pain of love and loss, the tantalizing embrace of death, the end of dreams, and the beginning of adult responsibility.\n\nScored by Jonny Greenwood with some narration by Watanabe, the film takes place in Tokyo in 1967 in the midst of student protests against the War in Vietnam. Trying to ease the pain of the shattering loss of Kizuki (Kengo Kora), a close friend from high school, Watanabe immerses himself in his studies at school where he is majoring in drama and, with Nagasawa (Tetsuji Tamayama), an older and more experienced friend, is able to release his tension by going to bars and picking up girls for sex. Things change, however, when Kizuki&apos;s former girlfriend, the beautiful but emotionally fragile Naoko (Rinko Kikuchi), shows up in Tokyo and reaches out to Watanabe for consolation. Though their language is exceedingly frank and sexually explicit, it is vital to understanding the characters and never used to titillate.\n\nTheir deepening relationship, however, only brings the feelings of loss closer to the surface and Naoko&apos;s ensuing emotional breakdown causes her to leave Tokyo for psychological rehabilitation at a mountain retreat where she is only able to see Watanabe intermittently. Even on occasional meetings, however, they embrace a dark ecstasy that inures them, at least temporarily, from their mutual grief, but when Naoko&apos;s roommate, music teacher Reiko (Reika Kirishima), sings the Lennon and McCartney song &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; at Naoko&apos;s 20th birthday party, the line &quot;and when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown,&quot; evokes tears that flow naturally.\n\nParalyzed by her sadness and feelings of responsibility for Kizuki&apos;s death, Naoko sinks deeper into despair and Watanabe&apos;s vows of lifelong fidelity are compromised by his attraction to Midori (Kiko Mizuhara), a smart, outgoing student who also has had to overcome a troubled past. Norwegian Wood is not a film about &quot;teenage angst,&quot; or any other of the favorite catch phrases that substitute for empathy, but about the essence of life itself and the anguish of having to let go of attachments. More of a tone poem than a free-flowing narrative, the film creates an indelible experience of both exquisite beauty and aching pain, perhaps two sides of the same coin. Like the under-appreciated Tony Takitani, another film based on a story by Murakami, Norwegian Wood unfolds like a dream, evoking a mood of serenity and contemplation.\n\nSupported by the stunning cinematography of Ping Bin Lee, much of the film&apos;s power takes place in the silences that allow us to simply observe the sublime beauty of the countryside, its forests, waterfalls, and the purity of its winter landscapes. While some may try, the film&apos;s emotional roller coaster cannot be filtered out and, in the process of assimilating it, it builds a quiet power that ensnares us and leaves us to explore its meanings long after the final credits. In spite of those who want to attach the label of &quot;boring&quot; to every film that moves slowly and requires concentration, Norwegian Wood will be remembered as one of Hung&apos;s best films and a work that brought cinema to a new level of artistic achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "Puri Jagannath&apos;s &apos;Bbuddah Hoga Tera Baap&apos; is a celebration of Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s iconic status, particularly of his angry young man image that was immensely popular in the 80s. As much I disliked most of those movies from the 80s, I thoroughly enjoyed this film from the start. Furthermore, even though it&apos;s a tribute to Bachchan and pays homage, none of it is overdone or thrown in your face. It is all done in an entertaining and amusing fashion. The action scenes are over the top and silly but also very funny immediately reminding the viewer of those silly Bachchan films. Shot with style and colour, the film looks &apos;cool&apos;. Think of this as a remake of an 80s Bachchan flick that is well updated and funny. The humour works very well. The dialogues are hilarious as they parody the 80s masala flicks.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan delivers a completely laidback performance. Even though &apos;Bbuddah Hoga Tera Baap&apos; is a celebration of his angry young man image, he appears completely relaxed and delivers a natural performance and reminding the viewer again of his flair for comedy. Sonu Sood is well cast as he very much resembles a young Amitabh and is competent. Even though she has a tiny role, Ravishing Raveena Tandon is superb as the hot sexy mom who is completely nuts about Bachchan&apos;s Vijju. She provides some laugh out loud comic relief. Elegant Hema Malini adds grace and class. The two young actresses are passable and Prakash Raj is brilliant as the over-the-top villain.\n\nOverall, this isn&apos;t a film to be taken seriously. The title already suggests that. It&apos;s easily watchable with the family, as a date movie or a rainy day flick with a glass of fresh drinks. The references also give it nostalgic value. Just sit back, relax and let the film start as its maker welcomes you to share this celebration of an actor who has made a solid place for himself in the history of Bollywood."

      "name": "The Movie That Changed Burt Reynolds Career",
      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t talk about this movie without discussing it&apos;s troubled production.\n\nBlake Edwards originally wrote the script in the 1970&apos;s. When his wife Julie Andrews read it, she thought it was the best thing he&apos;d done and urged him to make it. He gave it to Taxi actress Marilu Henner (who he had just worked with on the Burt Reynolds movie The Man Who Loved Women) She read it and told him she loved the script, but didn&apos;t want the part he wanted for her, but that of the secretary. Edwards rewrote the script (making the secretary&apos;s role bigger) she was in. Edwards the gave it to Burt Reynolds who loved it, and immediately saw Clint in the &apos;minor cop role&apos; and asked Edwards to rewrite it again. Clint liked it, but asked for another rewrite, he liked the new script, and all was good.\n\nBlake wanted Julie Andrews (Burts co star in The Man Who Loved Women) cast in the role of Burts girlfriend, Clint wanted Sondra Locke. Edwards also wanted Kim Basinger (another from The Man Who Loved Women) The studio said nobody who had starred with Clint or Burt in a previous movie, could be hired.\n\nThe next day, Burt was told Eastwood wanted Edwards off the picture. During this time Edwards last movie tanked and Clint&apos;s went through the roof. The studio were siding with the red hot Clint. With Edwards gone, Clint was in control. He ordered yet another rewrite, this time from Jospeh Stinson (whose only other writing credit was Sudden Impact) he brought in Malpaso regulars Lennie Niehaus and producer Fritz Manes too. \n\nWhen this was first discussed in 1983, it seemed like a good idea for Clint to star with Reynolds. Reynolds had just spent 5 straight years as the number 1 movie star in the world (78-82) and Since the turn of the decade he had a movie in the Top 10 Highest grossers of the year, whilst Clint only had 1, but by the time it was released Reynolds had 3 flops in a row, whilst Clint had a huge hit with Sudden Impact. Suddenly it seemed like it was wise of Burt to star with Clint. \n\nSadly Reynolds suffered a serious accident on the first nights shooting and had his jaw broken when he was hit in the face with a metal chair (instead of a breakaway chair made of balsa wood) while filming the fight scene in the cafe. Not wanting to shut production down, Reynolds decided to try and power through! He survived on a liquid diet and popping A LOT of pills, he says it was about 50 a day (this led to Reynolds becoming addicted to painkillers) and lost over thirty pounds by the time the film wrapped (leading to rumours he had AIDS) This accident had dire consequences for Reynolds career, which he would never recover from.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: A slick private eye (Reynolds) and tough police lieutenant (Eastwood) once best friends and partners, now bitter rivals reluctantly team up to investigate a murder.\n\nI love the opening of this movie, in the first of several neat period touches, City Heat opens with a black and white version of Warner Bros famous WB logo, this immediately sets the right feel for the era.\n\nCity Heat&apos;s opening credits appear in an old time Broadway style font. The credits appear in white, The movies name in red neon lights. We are immediately presented with a classic crime 30&apos;s movie scene, rain falls hard on a dark cobbled street, whilst a hotel advertises vacant rooms with a neon sign. Lieutenant Speer like so many Eastwood characters, is first scene in silhouette, emerging from under a street light heading for the warmth and of a nearby cafe. \n\nIt&apos;s in the cafe that we meet Eastwood and Reynolds characters. Eastwood doesn&apos;t move unless he has to, and speaks volumes whilst hardly uttering a word. Reynolds on on the other hand is a motormouth who hardly stands still. This scene is a joy, it has banter between its leads, laughs and a fight. Reynolds is fighting two goons, and Clint refuses to help, despite Reynolds pleas. That is until one of the goons bumps into Clint and spills his coffee. At which point he gets a psychotic twitch in his eye, and he helps Reynolds out. \n\nThen from the eight minutes onwards it&apos;s all downhill for the remaining hour and 29 minutes. OK that is a little harsh as it does have its moments now and again. It moved along at a comfortable pace, it&apos;s action is well done, and it&apos;s not without its amusing moments (like when they are trying to out do each other with the bigger guns) and witty one liners. If you are a fan of either actor, there is something to enjoy over it&apos;s short run time. (One of the shortest of Eastwood&apos;s career)\n\nI believe if the movie had been as good as the first 8 minutes it would have been a classic, however it&apos;s script is uneven, it tries to incorporate too many subplots, and some of the dialogue is painful and unfunny. \n\nReynolds blames himself for the movies poor performance, which I think is a bit harsh, as he was sick, so it&apos;s a miracle the movie got finished at all!! &quot;It should have been Dirty Harry V&apos;s my cop from Sharky&apos;s Machine, instead it was Dirty Harry V&apos;s A Wimp! I just didn&apos;t have it in me, and it will always be one of my biggest regrets of my career&quot; City Heat grossed $38 million at the domestic box office, to end 1984 the 28th highest grossing movie of the year. \n\nAfter 1984, Reynolds would not work again for two years.",

      "reviewBody": "Undercurrent (1946)\n\nMelodrama with Katherine Hepburn instead of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford?\n\nYes. And it works, though differently. Hepburn rules the movie, for sure, and she covers some range from sweet daughter of a scientist to a rich man&apos;s wife losing her innocence to someone who rises up on her own two feet. She&apos;s still the classy (or stiff) Hepburn (depending who you ask). I like her, and I liked her in this film a lot.\n\nThe plot uses a whole range of clichés but uses them well. The slight twists to what you expect are never shocking, but they keep you guessing. The second big star, seemingly, is Robert Mitchum, but if you are a fan of his, don&apos;t see the movie for his role. It&apos;s exceedingly minor. A very strange contract arrangement on that one. When he is there, it&apos;s undramatic, though he&apos;s in command, of course. The other male lead, Robert Taylor, is his usual reasonable, appropriate self--carefully chosen words to avoid saying a little starchy and ordinaire. One bit part is predictably colorful, Marjorie Main with her earthy comebacks.\n\nDirector Vincente Minnelli is in good form here, actually, and if the movie seems routine, it&apos;s the story that holds it back. He has some great photography behind it all (Karl Freund), and the score is unusually effective and beautiful (Herbert Stothart). I wouldn&apos;t call it a film noir, though it has shadings of the style and it&apos;s from that post war dark period. Instead, it&apos;s a noir melodrama. Worth seeing, absolutely, if you like those kinds of films.",

It was the long version, so it got quite late.\n\nI didn&apos;t regret that one bit. It has a nice story thats seems to fit if you&apos;re willing to go along with it (one can always find a stick to beat the dog). It has witty, funny dialogs. Although it is a romantic story, it does not have the crappy all&apos;s well that ends well feel.\n\nThe 2 main characters are very well developed (in the version I saw), they are not clear cut, one dimensional. It is true that some other characters are bordering on the slapstick, but I feel this is not overdone. Somehow it balances really well.\n\nNeed I say more? Excellent entertainment (in my humble opinion).",

      "reviewBody": "The Painted Veil is my favorite Somerset Maugham novel so I was concerned about how much justice could be done to this hauntingly beautiful story of revenge, love and redemption. Is it possible to take a masterpiece and make a decent film out of it in Hollywood? Apparently yes! Could the movie have been better - absolutely, but does it get the job done well? I&apos;d say yes.\n\nEd Norton is Walter - a bacteriologist stationed in Shangai. In Londn he mets and falls in love with the beautiful Kitty (Naomi Watts), hasty marriage and honeymoon in Venice later they are both in China. He is busy - she is bored. And what better way to relieve boredom than an extramarital affair with Charlie - the philandering consular official (Liev Schrieber)? But Walter discovers the affair and decides to volunteer to a cholera stricken province and take Kitty with him. Charlie was never serious anyway so off they go into the jaws of death. In the cholera infested back of beyond Walter and Kitty discover more about each other than they did in many months of marriage. A mutual respect grows into something else but it is a cholera infested region after all. So the tale must have a tragic ending and it does. But it leaves one with a sense of relief as the camera finally moves away from the oppressive dark tones and into light.\n\nThe movie has beautiful performances by Ed Norton and Ms. Watts. His serious, then almost sinister, then enlighetened Walter is the perfect foil to her luminous, wicked and then vulnerable Kitty. Liev Schrieber is good in the brief role as Charlie and all the supporting cast is very good indeed. The locale is stunning and the mood is brilliantly captured in the dark, the shadows and moments of light.\n\nAre there Hollywood moments? Of course there are, mostly during the growing attraction between the lead pair there are the clichéd moments of &quot;intoxication&quot;, his looking suddenly more attractive and youthful, her moments with the orphanage kids. But none of it is over the top. The movie is full of mood, sensuous beauty and emotion. I enjoyed the film and I think Mr. Maugham is there somewhere nodding his head in approval at a job well done.",

      "reviewBody": "This was one of those films caught during the transition to sound and issued in a silent and sound version.  Unfortunately, MGM didn&apos;t make separate continuity versions - they simply added a soundtrack (music and sound effects) to the silent version.  But the silent film could be run at the proper speed - anywhere from 16 to 22 frames a second at the discretion of the projectionist - whereas the sound version had to be shown at 24 frames a second, the fixed speed to have the sound come out right.  So you see the action faster than you are supposed to, making some of it seem rushed, quite noticeable and often annoying.\n\nThe plot is your basic love quadrangle with Crawford in love with and getting secretly engaged to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., while Page is in love with him.  It&apos;s secret so Crawford can play up to influential Rod La Rocque, who can get Fairbanks a diplomatic job.  She cruelly lies to La Rocque, who falls in love with her, saying Fairbanks is a friend, only a boy.  While Crawford is getting to La Rocque, Fairbanks and Page have an affair, which he regrets, finally telling her of his engagement.  Page simply says she will never tell Crawford, her best friend. After La Rocque gets Fairbanks the job, the  engagement is announced, enraging La Rocque to the point he almost rapes Crawford.  I was really surprised when they were alone in his cabin and he grabs Crawford, that he yanks her hair back violently so he could kiss her passionately.  He finally leaves in disgust, after telling her he stopped not because of decency, but because he didn&apos;t want her. Crawford marries Fairbanks, but all four are in for some big surprises.\n\nThe love scenes are punctuated with a lot of jazz age fun.  We see Crawford doing a nice interpretive dance at a party, and Fairbanks imitate John Barrymore doing his facial changes made in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), and then imitate John Gilbert passionately kissing a woman. Those two are mentioned by name, but then someone yells &quot;Do Robin Hood,&quot; an amusing &quot;in&quot; joke because it referred to his real life father, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. in Robin Hood (1922).  And he does it very well, leaping and posturing just as his father did, a reason why he was able to make some swashbuckling films himself later on.",

      "reviewBody": "One of those films I found myself liking a lot, but it&apos;s difficult to say exactly why.  The Hard Word has a little bit of everything going at once - heist film, love story, comedy, and drama.  It could be (and was) marketed as a thriller about lowlife criminals, double crosses and crime not paying - in other words an obvious Australian-style Tarantino rip-off like the boring and derivative &quot;Two Hands&quot;.  However it seems to take its cues more from the kind of slower paced, character-based crime movies that were popular from the 70&apos;s.\n\nOften movies like this one choose style over substance, and skitter along on simplistic scripts and dumb dialogue. Not the case here at all-The Hard Word has enough going in both departments to keep you more than interested and entertained, a credit to writer/director Scott Roberts. The music in this film is also worth mentioning - it&apos;s very good and matches the style of the film perfectly. \n\nWhat makes the movie special is an amazing, low-key performance from Guy Pearce, whose talent becomes more evident every time he graces the screen. Playing one of three incorrigible but non-violent bank robbing brothers, he manages to make his character watchable, interesting and original.  Co-star Rachel Griffiths plays his sneaky, trashy, two-timing wife; her performance is not quite up to Pearce&apos;s, but doesn&apos;t do anything to weigh the film down, and most of the other actors are top-notch.   \n\n I don&apos;t think this film did much business in the US (yet another indie that probably played on about three screens and no one heard about), but I predict it will find an audience on video and could even become a bona fide cult classic.",

Who does he find? Sir Laurence Olivier..a Police Constable . Donat ushers him into his lab, sits him down and proceeds to ramble on about what he&apos;s invented. Sir Laurence, the ever vigilant and cautious policeman thinks he&apos;s some kind of nut and slowly reaches for his night stick..that&apos;s when Robert Donat flicks on the first moving pictures of Hyde Park...Olivier is flabergasted..gets up moves to the sheet and looks behind it..&quot;That&apos;s Hyde Park!&apos; After rambling some more Robert Donat breaks into tears..finally explaining what he has accomplished..Olivier replies &quot;You must be a very happy man&quot;..a terrific scene and one I&apos;ll never forget. A cameo appearance by Lord Olivier and a very memorable scene."

This supporting feature is a second remake of a silent film made in 1927. Its main theme is about imagination being the best way to beat a dishonest criminal. It is a predictable story apart from one unexpected plot turn and there is only slender character development. However, John Wayne gives it thrust as a man of good scruples. Louise Latimer brinks sparkle to their romance. Robert McWade is amusing as the crusty boss of a large trucking company. It gets convoluted when Wayne&apos;s character goes against the rival for his affections but action in the form of a cross-country race gives the final third a shot-in-the-arm. All in all, watchable for its running time but lacks subtlety in direction and cinematography.",

      "reviewBody": "I fall into the first category: anything with lycanthropy, I&apos;m THERE!  Peter Cushing is  fantastic in this film.  My particular favorite line he does as a throwaway, looking at a  fresh corpse, &quot;Oh, yes, that is VERY nasty.&quot;  The red lens was a great idea, used  effectively in its first scene, then poorly in every scene following.  You don&apos;t really get a  good look at the werewolf til two-thirds into the film and that&apos;s for the best.  The time- lapse transformation scene starts out great, the next to last shot looks menacing and  feral and you wish it&apos;d stop there, then finishes with this silvery-white helmet head look  that is nothing short of ludicrous looking in this, the revelatory scene.\n\nThe film is not  without pathos, however.  As an animal lover, I couldn&apos;t help but feel pity for Etoil as he  was forced to beat one of the wolves in his zoo to death.  And, you Hammer elitists out  there, you cannot deny that the final sequence with Etoil and Christine is moving and  poignantly tragic.  Crawling through the sewers weezing &quot;Christine...Christine...&quot;.\n\nI confess: I own this on VHS, &apos;87 Interglobal release.  I got it when I was 8 and obsessed  with werewolves, and I watched it constantly.  Every other year or so, I pop it in and I&apos;m  not terribly disappointed.  Not good, but better than a few Hammer films.  So there."

      "reviewBody": "...and it&apos;s pretty good. RSM Benton is given more depth than he was during the series. The story ends abruptly, but that&apos;s fine. Exposition probably would&apos;ve dragged it down a bit. Mark Ayres&apos; music is a bit overpowering for the most part. It generally works only when it&apos;s low key. Some of the jump cuts are effective, some are jarring. My biggest gripe on the technical side came during the scenes where the UNIT soldier was guarding the jeep. Why shoot it in slow motion? I was initially under the impression that time was slowing down, but apparently that wasn&apos;t the case. The confrontation between Benton and his dead father was great, and there&apos;s a realistic fight scene at the end. All in all, a pretty good first go.\n\nRounding out the tape is a &quot;Making of&quot; special where you get an idea of how enthusiastic Keith Barnfarther was over filming the whole thing, and how long-winded collaborator Nicholas Briggs is. There&apos;s also a summary of some of the independent spin-offs produced by Reeltime Pictures since."

This particular one concerns the doomed Franklin Expedition and asks the important question--what was their fate? Back in the 1840s, a British expedition tried to find a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific through Canada. Unfortunately, no one from the expedition returned and rescue parties sent only came up with scant evidence--some evidence that the British government refused to accept. Now, given new discoveries and a 1980s scientific examination of two corpses buried early in the expedition (which were the subject of an earlier &quot;Nova&quot; episode--a great one at that) as well as newer evidence, they piece together a portrait of what appears to have happened. Using lots of nice historical recreations and various interviews, they created an excellent documentary--one well worth your time.",

Poor acting by mostly unknown but also well-known actors - and a plot that only as a result of the over-the-top dramatic music is so simple and almost boring.\n\nIf you want to spend a couple of hours enjoying yourself with a nice movie at the cinema, this is not the one!",

Although not unravelling the question where the bank-money goes to, the used examples are diverse and relevant to the gap issue between the west and the &apos;emerging countries&apos;.\n\nI got to agree though this might be a movie hard to watch, as moderate knowledge of economic terms are needed in order to enjoy and keep up with the story. Also, the connections between the different scenes weren&apos;t obvious. Although it all had to do with money and investors, the link between them were vague and not chronological. This tended to be dragging down the movie: you could sense people were waiting for the final scene, as they couldn&apos;t figure out which one would be it.\n\nI liked the way how globalisation as subject was captured by filming in all these locations, showing how it applies to all these people.",

The young men tell that they are the crew of a motor pleasure yacht and they invite the girls to visit the vessel, where they introduce the chief-engineer Sean (Robert Boulter). The seven youngsters use ecstasy and smoke the powerful Russian Ice; Bluey talks about kinky sex including Donkey Punch and Dirty Sanchez; and they decide to navigate to the Mediterranean deep sea to see the sunset. The easy Lisa has sex with Bluey first and then anal sex with Josh; Vic has sex with Marcus and Tammi stays on the main deck talking to Sean. When Josh decides to practice Donkey Punch on Lisa, he accidentally kills the girl, in the beginning of a nightmarish gore night.\n\n&quot;Donkey Punch&quot; begins erotic, with three sexy actresses very exposed, and ends gore after a weird accident. The title refers to a fictitious and mortal practice of anal sex, when the penetrated partner is punched on the head or neck to tight the anal passage and increase the orgasm of the partner. The greatest surprise in the story is that none of the partners use condom, i.e., all of them has unprotected sex. &quot;Donkey Punch&quot; will never be nominated to any Award, but it is entertaining and I liked it. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Prazeres Mortais&quot; (&quot;Deadly Pleasures&quot;)",

The story is that a bus is trying to cross Nevada&apos;s alkali flats when a winter storm hits and forces the passengers to take refuge in an abandoned church miles from the nearest town. Carole Lombard plays Billie, a young woman being taken to prison. The other passengers include the cop that is accompanying Billie, a young girl, a banker, and, of course the bus driver. The group enters the church to find they are not alone. Bill (William Boyd) has found shelter there too, has a large stash of food, and wants to order everyone around.\n\nThis is one of those films in which a bunch of characters of diverse backgrounds are forced to sit through a crisis and talk about themselves. However, &quot;Petrified Forest&quot; this is not. Because it is an early sound film the director seems to think somebody has to be saying something all of the time, whether or not it is interesting or done in a non-monotonous tone. It will be the longest hour in your life. The only thing worse than boring stilted conversation is boring stilted conversation you can&apos;t hear well.",

Three important burglaries shock Governments of Britain, Italy and Japan where are robbed the Japanese Imperial sword, the Great Bill , and Shroud of Turin prompting governments to set up a detective &apos;dream team&apos; to resolve these crimes supposedly committed by a criminal named &apos;Tornado&apos;. France there are a great mayhem for the robbery of his ¨Pink Panther¨ an enormously expensive diamond and assigns bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, his assistant Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), and Secretary, Nicole (Emily Mortimer), to this issue . Although Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese replacing Kevin Kline)from the Surete would much prefer seeing Clouseau issuing traffic tickets. The team, consisting of detectives from Britain (Alfred Molina), Japan (Matsuzaki), and Italy (Andy Garcia), and Sonia Solandres (Aishwarya Ray) who attempts to woo Clouseau with shady aims . They travel to Italy where &apos;Tornado&apos; reportedly inhabits , being the main suspect an aristocrat (Jeremy Irons). This is where they will face their worst mission . Bungling Inspector Clouseau hasn&apos;t clues but it doesn&apos;t mind . He along with his helper Gilbert Ponton are going into disgraces, mishap , botches and wreak havoc from Paris to Rome. Then the international dream team is humiliated and newspapers publicize: ¨ Bungler Clouseau a disgrace, entire nation loses panache, French detective idiot ¨ .\n\nThe film gets entertaining and fun with hilarious moments here and there and never slowdown although contains others ridiculous and disappointing . The picture takes parts from previous entries Sellers&apos; movies (Pink Panther, Shot in dark,The return,revenge,Panther strikes again). As Steve Martin struggles with two kids imitating Sellers and his Kung Fu fighting with Cato -Burt Kwouk- . Steve Martin combines splendidly his comic talent at his peak doing a witty spoof of the absurdities of Peter Sellers character. Evolves famous costars as Alfred Molina, Andy Garcia , John Cleese , a gorgeous Idian star as Rai and many others ; furthermore a magnificent opening cartoon titles. As always lively and jolly music ( arranged by Christophe Beck ) by the great Henry Mancini. Several chuckles and gags ,the result of which is a funny film . Film gets memorable occasion for amusing and entertainment. This sequel is better than Steve Martin&apos;s former entry .",

      "reviewBody": "This film anticipates the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; film formula with a great story that affirms one&apos;s faith in God and the true missionary spirit of Catholic priests who went to various parts of the world to help the poor and the wretched of the earth at great personal sacrifice.\n\nYet the greatness of the film is not about the missionary zeal of Catholic priests but more about faith in God--the loss of faith and the process of regaining it. It is not an action film, it is a spiritual journey where convicts turn religious by observing selfless actions of others. It brings to mind Pearl S. Buck&apos;s &quot;Satan never sleeps&quot;. The choice of the title &quot;Devil at 4 O&apos;clock&quot; is unfortunate as the film is not about any devil--there is only a volcanic eruption at that time.\n\nEven if you choose to discount the story, the film is admirable for its earthquake and volcano/lava flow sequences. I wonder how they were able to splice in realistic lava scenes as well as scenes of a small plane flying in close proximity to a volcano in full fury.\n\nAlong with &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; and &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; this film ranks high as a Spencer Tracy film. He carries the film on his shoulders with good support from Frank Sinatra and Gregoire Aslan. Joseph Biroc&apos;s camerawork and Mervyl Leroy&apos;s decision to direct this film are commendable. If you have not seen the film see it, it will uplift your spirits and your faith in human values.",

This is one of those professional killer movies not just for the gung-ho guys, but also for the artistic folks out there and gals who just wanna oggle at the good-looking killers.\n\nI must say that the cinematography is good. And boy, am I impressed by the story plot. The writer&apos;s just so good to depict various ways to kill someone.\n\nAnd the movie makes you accept killing like an everyday affair, just like eating or bathing. A must-see movie for those of you who are keen on watching movie with plots that are out-of-the-ordinary!"

You have to pay attention and give it some thought, like modern symphonic music or abstract painting, but doing so might just reward you with a strong appreciation. It is (a bit dated) psychedelic eye candy and food for thought. It can be rather depressing, or if taken lightly, can be quite comical. I found myself dumbfounded, asking the screen &quot;WHAT?!&quot; several times, but it was a good kind of &quot;what?&quot; because it&apos;s so off the wall. If you discount anything mind-bending or mentally challenging as boring or stupid, if your idea of great film-making is &quot;Signs&quot; or &quot;True Lies,&quot; don&apos;t bother with &quot;Wax.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lay the Favorite&quot; has many dissenters, most complaining that it&apos;s completely unbelievable. It&apos;s true, it is. Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a ditzy bimbo who quits her job as a stripper and moves to Las Vegas to become a cocktail waitress. A great idea! Instead, as soon as she arrives, she gets a very lucrative job as a sports bettor for a bookie who isn&apos;t a bookie since bookmaking is illegal. She&apos;s a genius with numbers and words.\n\nShe&apos;s also capable of getting guys to do whatever they think she wants. They need to do the thinking since she&apos;s too dumb to even know what she wants. The kicker to this story of an over-sexed, ditzy bimbo, numbers genius, sports-betting millionaire, is that it&apos;s a true story. I decided to watch the YouTube video of the real Beth Raymer reading from her memoir which this film is based on to see if Hall accurately captured her varying characteristics. And she did. She does the hair twirl and the dumb girl giggle as she describes the kings of sports gambling giving her job after job after job.\n\nI&apos;m one of the few who liked Rebecca Hall in this. So different from her usual indie fare. She has to ooze sex and play beautiful even though she has never really been described that way before. But in order to like this movie at all, you need to care about this floozy. Other than her ridiculous free ride through life, nothing really interesting happens to her. \n\nHer first job in Vegas is with Dink (Bruce Willis) who owns Dink Inc. She loves him, he loves her  mind? Yeah, right. Apparently he does. So when she gets herself in trouble along with a nice, smart successful guy (Joshua Jackson) who doesn&apos;t seem to mind throwing his life away for her, he comes to the rescue. \n\nPersonally, I found Hall&apos;s sexy naiveté and Willis&apos; extreme gambling entertaining enough to keep watching. However, the movie doesn&apos;t seem to play the unfortunate reality that this is a true story for laughs. When there&apos;s a story too unbelievable to be true then you should be making fun of everybody who allowed it to occur, instead the film just wanted the audience to go along for a fun ride. It is somewhat fun, it&apos;s also very unbelievable, and ultimately, pretty stupid.\n\nWho Might Like This: Anybody who likes seeing ditzy bimbos succeed in life; people who like watching unbelievably true stories; fans of Rebecca Hall.",

      "reviewBody": "But that&apos;s why some people love Spalding Gray. And although I do not fall into that category, per se, I was very entertained by this 80-minute monologue -- told in ranting New Yorker mannerisms that are nonetheless fairly endearing -- about what Gray should do about his macular pucker.\n\nThe macular pucker, we learn in great detail, is an eye condition that must ultimately be &quot;scraped&quot; in order to restore normal vision. Gray, a born Christian Scientist and an enduring doctor-phobe, walks around New York City, tearing his hair out while choosing among the opinions of an array of quacks who weigh in on the issue. (Or, at least, he describes himself doing this -- the whole film is a series of closeups of Gray in a studio, with various visual stimuli applied to him, through the wonderful direction of the visionary Steven Soderbergh). Through the course of the narrative he describes near-slapstick visits to a Native American sweat lodge, a Phillipino doctor who is the Elvis of healers, a quirky New Jersey &quot;dietary opthalmologist&quot; and several others. It&apos;s all told with great storytelling verve, and occasional moments of poignancy.\n\nThe film also consists of a series of short documentary interviews with about 8 survivors of eye trauma, who each nearly lost (or in some cases did) vision in stomach-churning ways. Their occasional thoughts on the healing process are very fascinating.\n\nBecause of its odd structural format, the one-man narrative film threatens to fall by the wayside. Not that it has ever been a particularly popular form, but its appeal is perhaps dwindling further as our attention spans, and ability to sit through prolonged stories, deteriorate. However, Gray, with a boost from Soderbergh, gives the genre a good name -- and hope",

Filmmaker Joel Schumacher makes an audacious attempt to rekindle his directing juices in this low-budget semi-independent film about Vietnam with a cast of unknowns that works remarkably well. Set circa 1971 Louisiana in a special Army training camp for new recruits prior to shipment in the ongoing war and told in flashback by one of the survivors the film centers its bare bones plot around the able shoulders of Irish newcomer Farrell in a potential star-making turn as Private Roland Bozz (think &apos;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&apos; in fatigues and you get the overall impression), a feckless troublemaker of his platoon whose antics have a method to his madness: keeping yourself alive despite the odds. Raw and uncompromising are best suited to describe the film&apos;s gist and in particular its focus of Bozz leading his comrades in arms through their hellish grunt duty prior to their fated dooms. Original and smartly written by Ross Klaven and Michael McGruther giving their characters a fresh spin on an all too familiar genre with humanity at its core."

Not being a New Yorker - Silicon Valley is about as far away as you can get - I&apos;m afraid I have not been drawn to movies of his plays as strongly as to other comedies.\n\nBut Prisoner of Second Avenue is an exception. Maybe it&apos;s because I am indeed in Silicon Valley, where layoffs are something we all get to experience. But this movie captured so aptly the craziness of being laid off, staying home all day - seeing only the one you love (but starting to hate him/her too as an extension of your own self-hatred). Making petty grievances huge, and trying to pretend the truly huge issues no longer exist. And worrying about the bills, and the clothes, and how silly the family behaves when money gets involved. And how the bad luck seems to snowball. And how &quot;therapy&quot; sessions seem so futile.\n\nThe acting is superb - but I don&apos;t know of a movie where Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft have ever given us any less. Bancroft, in particular, when she makes the transition to anger, is perfect. Thankfully we&apos;re not handed any sop at the end either. \n\nThe subject is so realistic that I don&apos;t find it funny at all - but that&apos;s a failing of the times we live in, not the movie.

These film makers are very brave and I applaud them. Everyone involved in this project was &quot;working without a net&quot; and they succeeded masterfully. A thought provoking script and riveting performances that kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing what will come next. I know this was a low budget, art house film. They didn&apos;t have &quot;A&quot; list talent, or all of the bells and whistles of a major studio release. But they made an entertaining, thought provoking psychological thriller out of words and basically 2 guys in a car. Very brave! I hope more people have a chance to see this film. Well done!",

Cagney was such a great actor he would always help elevate others performances in his films and he does so very much in this one. This film is well done for it&apos;s time though it looks a little flawed with age now.\n\nThe story is actually based upon a real FBI case in the early 30&apos;s. It stretches the truth after a while in order to fit the task. The gun fight sequence towards the end is amazingly violent yet most of the what seems to be thousands of shots fired seem to miss everything.\n\nThis is one of many films that established Warner Brothers as :Gangster Films Inc&quot; during the 30&apos;s &amp; 40&apos;s. It is a strong entry which was well produced for a 1935 (early) film. It treats it&apos;s subject pretty well. If you like Cagney, this is a film you must see to understand how far he had already developed his acting skills in 1935.",

I found myself bored, focused more on editing data than I was on the film, I couldn&apos;t focus on it, and almost fell asleep once or twice. The incorporation of the Grudge like sounds seemed much like a grab at trying to keep the audience listening - maybe it was inspired somewhat by the &quot;Ju-on&quot; films, maybe it was the same sound editor, but either way, it also fell flat. I really did try to like this but the only nice thing to really say is, &quot;hey, this didn&apos;t 100% suck and come in at 1/10&quot;.\n\nI&apos;m a really big fan of Shiriashi Koji, and it pains me a little to be writing a mostly negative review for him, however, this is a nice look into where he started and how he developed and adapted when it comes up to films released after this.\n\nMore of an insight into a director rather than a horror film, &quot;Ju-Rei&quot; just left me wanting more and wishing I&apos;d picked something else.",

This one tests me sorely because everything about the film itself is completely without merit. The only interesting thing is Jeanne Tripplehorn&apos;s presence. What a fall from grace! She was in one of the decade&apos;s blockbusters `Basic Instinct.&apos;\n\nIn that, she was both attractive and showed some real acting promise. Not great, but promising. Rather like Ms Jolie or Theron at the time of this writing. She was also in the decade&apos;s hugest bomb, where her performance was harmoniously bad. How uneven a career. She was a strong harridan in the clever `Sliding Doors.&apos; but helped `Mickey Blue Eyes&apos; tank. &quot;Till There Was You&quot; was weakened by her. Now she shows up in a TV level piece of tripe. She could have saved this for me, because she had the chorus role. But she just didn&apos;t have the stuff. Is it drugs? Is it just random ups and downs?\n\nI have not seen her in `Timecode.&apos; That promises to be an important film for me. Let&apos;s hope for the best."

Imagine making Yamato with a Transformers budget. That would give time to bring to life the lengthy battles from the original series. Especially the scene, fighting the subspacemarine would be interesting to see in a sequel.\n\nWhat I liked about the movie is that it has characters. Somewhat cheesy and over-dramatizing characters at times, but that&apos;s Anime for you. There are some actual hero&apos;s voyages here involving more than cutting a distance between point a and b. There is the personal story of every character that makes this movie connect on more than an action level, in its best moments.\n\nIn its worst moments there are a lot of things I don&apos;t understand. Enemies there and then gone. A lot of stuff involving &quot;why didn&apos;t they do it&quot; scenarios on either the human or alien side. Plot vagueness might be a good way to call them without giving anything away. \n\nThe overall picture is recommendable to any Sci-Fi fan. It feels like they crammed a lot into it and don&apos;t always succeed with it. As has been said, the ending is kind of a drag, but it&apos;s alright. If I were to chose between this and Transformers, Yamato would make the race due to better story development, more interesting characters and a higher entertainment factor. I guess the Japanese acting is a bit stiff at times, but there is this sense of serenity about it, which makes it yet believable and enjoyable to the end."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Tis Pity She&apos;s A Whore&apos; is a lavishly produced and strongly acted  movie which raises a lot of fascinating questions about where to draw the line between art and exploitation, and indeed, if there is any need to.  Based on the play by Shakespeare&apos;s contemporary John Ford, it manages to work as an engrossing historical drama, and captivate as a passionate, albeit unconventional, romance, while still being sensationalistic enough to entertain any fan of AIP-style Seventies sleaze. The central relationship between Charlotte Rampling (&apos;The Damned&apos;, &apos;Zardoz&apos;, &apos;Angel Heart&apos;) and long forgotten 70s sex symbol Oliver Tobias (who I grew up watching on several UK TV shows popular at the time, but now too obscure to bother listing) is incestuous, and the movie ends up with a surprisingly bloody climax that will please splatter buffs. Like the recent controversial adaption of &apos;Titus&apos; it reminds the modern viewer that sex, violence and extreme imagery are are nothing new and have long been the subject of great literature. (Or if you prefer so-called &quot;great literature&quot;) &apos;Tis Pity She&apos;s A Whore&apos; is one of the great lost European movies of the early Seventies, and deserves a much larger audience. Knowing nothing about it before viewing, and not being familiar with the original text, I expected it to be a lighweight erotic romp worth a giggle or two, but was very impressed at just how powerful a movie experience it was. After watching it I immediately watched it again. Highly recommended."

It is a proposition which will have karmic repercussions for all involved.\n\nDirected by Brisbanite John Hillcoate from a script by Aussie indie icon Nick Cave, this film has some of the most gorgeous photography of the Australian outback ever committed to film, showcasing it&apos;s unique desolate beauty in it&apos;s dust, flies and exquisite sunsets.\n\nHillcoate assembles a very fine ensemble cast, most notably Ray Winstone as Captain Stanley and Guy Pearce as Charlie Burns - two actors performing at the top of their game. Danny Huston is effective as Arthur Burns, a man whose serene exterior belies his vicious temperament. Other performers include Emily Watson and John Hurt, as well as fine Australian talent David Wenham, Leah Purcell, Tommy Lewis and quintessential movie aborigine David Gulpilil. All performances are excellent.\n\nDespite it&apos;s high violence quotient, the film has an admirable lack of moralistic tone. There are no obvious good guys and bad guys, all the characters are shades of grey possessing both positive and negative attributes, although some characters may lean one way or the other. In particular, Captain Stanley has a good heart though history may judge his methods of justice with contempt, and Charlie Burns has a fierce sense of loyalty and honour but his associated family ties have led him to commit horrific crimes. Even Captain Stanley&apos;s wife, Martha, in all her Victorian innocence and naivety, has a dark side to her soul; an attribute which will further propel all towards their destinies.\n\nIt&apos;s strong subtext of white colonialists&apos; condescending treatment of the aboriginal population puts this film in fine company with other Australian indigenous-themed films such as Fred Schepisi&apos;s The Chant Of Jimmy Blacksmith, Nicholas Roeg&apos;s Walkabout, Rolf de Heer&apos;s The Tracker and Phillip Noyce&apos;s Rabbit Proof Fence. The Proposition is the best of these. This is a big call, I know, but the fact is that none of those other very fine Australian films possess the tension which so completely permeates Hillcoates&apos; picture. This film represents a major achievement for both Hillcoate and Cave and is the best Australian film to leave these shores since Ray Lawrence&apos;s Lantana.\n\n8.5 out of 10.\n\nSlick. :cool:",

      "reviewBody": "Nagin (1976) : Brief Review -\n\nDidn&apos;t know my childhood fascination was actually the best fantasy horror film of Bollywood in the last 5 decades. Nagin is about to turn 50, and in these 5 decades, I don&apos;t really think any film has come close to it when it comes to a proper commercial mythological fantasy horror saga in Bollywood. We were very late to pick the mythological and fantasy elements into the horror genre than Hollywood, who did it way back in the 20s with silent movies and then in the 30s with talkies. Rajkumar Kohli&apos;s filmography has been forgotten, deservingly, but two of his works in the fantasy horror genre, Nagin and Jaani Dushman, will forever be the best in this category. We hardly have horror classics with ghosts or revenge theories. Today, we have Tumbbad and some of those classics like Mahal and some 60s stuff to argue, and Ramsay&apos;s works were not on that level, even though they are very popular to date. Kohli&apos;s Nagin may be that one film that I wouldn&apos;t call a classic but would definitely call a film to be remembered and certainly the best commercial horror film since ages. It was a super hit in the initial run and then re-release. I can imagine the fear, the fascination, and the mystical nostalgia people must have felt back in the 70s, when Bollywood was heavily riding on masala movies. Reena Roy looks so freaking hot in her first appearance only, and then throughout the film with those grey eyes, lipstick, and dark eyelids. Besides being a fascinating fantasy flick, Nagin is such a stimulating and sexy film. There is so much spice and glamor in it. There are flaws too that one can easily notice today, but they are forgivable. It comes out as such a frightening entertainer, just like Jaws was in Hollywood around the same time. People used to pay to get scared back then. Imagine the fun of doing so for yourself. Thank you, Kohli Saab, for this evergreen horror fantasy that has come a long way through 5 decades and almost 3 generations.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "What starts out as a fine Korean period piece takes a sudden turn for the super-natural as an ancient spirit returns for revenge upon the empire which imprisoned it. Flying acrobatics abound and the film is all the more entertaining for it.\n\nGoing back to B.C. Korea, the rising Shilla empire wipes out an occult clan in the attempt to unify the people. The clan&apos;s leader happens to be a powerful sorcerer and promises revenge before being sealed away with a magical sword. Fast forward almost a thousand years and we find the Shilla empire in some disarray; rebels threaten the outer empire and the kingdom&apos;s greatest general has left his position to marry a peasant girl. After he finally returns to arms, royal guards attempt to assassinate his wife. While in her own defense, she removes the magic sword from it&apos;s resting place, thus unleashing the vengeful spirit and putting the entire empire in danger.\n\nThe main plot is a little slim. The evil spirit is largely under developed and the human conflicts are passed over too quickly to generate much emotion. The cause of this is the short running time, 92 minutes does not a lot much time to examine the intricate workings of an ancient Korean political system, much less exploring the super-natural story line. As such, both plots feel like side stories rather than either feeling like the core of the film.\n\nFortunately the rest of the film makes up for the story&apos;s lacking. The budget is obviously not big, but they do a good job of convincing you others wise. The actors are pretty good, so far as the script allows, and the cinematography is catching to the eye. There are some low-rent CG images, but they brief enough so as not to intrude.\n\nThe biggest success of the film is the fight scenes, and being a historic war picture that makes up for a lot. Well shot and choreographed, with buckets of blood with nearly every sword strike, the fight scenes evoke a great sense of cathartic release.\n\nA fun action/drama/horror/war picture that just needed a beefed up script to be really great. Regaurdless, still recommended.\n\n8/10",

      "name": "Frankenstein!  Starring the Wolf Man and Count Dracula!",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Frankenstein&apos;s Bloody Terror&quot; is what I like to call one of them horror hodgepodges. There&apos;s a whole lot going on and it might look very confusing, but basically it&apos;s a very straightforward and sensationalist horror mess made in Europe but mainly intended for the American drive-in crowd. It&apos;s the first entry in the long-running and relatively notorious Spanish &quot;Hombre-Lobo&quot; series, all starring Paul Naschy as the eternally doomed lycanthrope Count Waldemar Daninsky. Some of the sequels might be better known, like &quot;The Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Women&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Devil&quot;, but this is the movie that introduced us to Waldemar and showed us how he became a werewolf. In spite of the suave sounding title, the film has absolutely nothing to do with the mad scientist Baron Frankenstein or its monstrous creation. There are, however, plenty of werewolves and vampires. It&apos;s just that, around that time in particular, any horror flick with &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in its title was a guaranteed hit amongst the horror loving audiences. The makers of this film inventively put the connection by claiming the Frankensteins are distantly related to the Wolfsteins, a noble European family that were cursed with Lycanthropy. The last descendant of the Wolfsteins lies dead in the family crypt, with the silver dagger still in his heart to prevent resurrection. When a greedy gypsy couple (gypsies  they always screw things up in horror movies) removes the dagger, the wolf man goes on a bloody killing spree in town. Waldemar Daninsky and Rudolph Weissmann, two romantic rivals battling for the love of the yummy young countess Janice Von Aerenberg, are forced to team up during the organized hunt in the woods. Waldemar saves Rudolph&apos;s life when the wolf man attacks, but he can&apos;t avoid getting bitten and thus takes over the curse. In a last desperate attempt to find a cure, they call upon professor Dr. Janos Mikhelov, but he and his voluptuous wife Wandessa are actually vampires and primarily interested in the virgin blood of Janice and Rudolph. \n\nYes, okay, admittedly this all sounds quite convoluted and ambitious, but the truth is that &quot;Frankenstein&apos;s Bloody Terror&quot; is nothing more than an amusing roller-coaster of campy horror and kitsch! The film has a rather slow and talkative opening half hour – with too much dull and pointless information about the love triangle between Janice, Rudolph and Waldemar - but as soon as the gypsies desecrate the Wolfstein tomb, there&apos;s non-stop bloody action and typical Euro-horror camp. The plot centering solely around the lycanthrope is still very atmospheric and moody (with eerie images of a dark forest and the vicious attack of a family), but as soon as the vampires appear, the whole thing just becomes too eccentric. Approaching the finale, there even is a wrestling match between two werewolves and the oddest vampire-kill in history of horror cinema. Whenever the plot becomes too much of a mess, the film reverts to the chattering fathers of Janice and Rudolph, as they summarize what&apos;s been going on at regular intervals. The make-up effects are decent and actually rather gruesome for 1968 and there are numerous hints at sleaze and perversion. This was the first horror film of Paul Naschy, but he kept playing Waldemar Daninsky throughout 12 more films and over a span of nearly 40 years. As in most of his films (especially the ones he wrote and directed himself), Paul Naschy plays a character that is extremely successful amongst the ladies even though he&apos;s not the least bit attractive. Waldemar Dankinsky for life!",

Henry&apos;s Full House&quot; used large casts to tell several interlocked stories.  &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; is the best of the anthology films, following the adventures of a tuxedo&apos;s tailcoat as it passes through the hands of several diverse people in New York.  There&apos;s Charles Boyer, the Broadway actor who is carrying on an illicit affair; there&apos;s Henry Fonda who is helping Cesar Romero get out of a sticky situation with his fiancee Ginger Rogers (along the way, Fonda and Rogers fall in love and have one of the best-written love scenes to ever hit the screen); there&apos;s Charles Laughton who seeks one shot at glory conducting an orchestra; and, in the most touching and rewarding of the tales, there&apos;s Edward G. Robinson, a down-and-out bum who has been invited to his college reunion.  If you&apos;re looking for an all-star cast and a first-rate cinema experience, &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; is the one.  I consistently put this movie at the top of my all-time favorites.",

It is set somewhere in space to make it feel like a location that is truly desolate and the chances of leaving are slim to none.\n\nAll of the characters in this are imperfect, not all bad people but definitely people in a bad, and almost hopelessly trapped, situation. That is true of many movies in the last 20-25 years or so, but many can&apos;t make the story or characters engaging. This one at least succeeds in that, where others have failed due to trying too hard in the acting or making the plot needlessly convoluted.\n\nThis is a story about how people in bad situations set their priorities, and in the end treat each other and themselves. And as that, it&apos;s fairly decent.\n\nI&apos;ve watched it twice on basic cable (basically for free) and it was certainly worth every penny. Heck, I&apos;d be happy even if I spent 3-4 bucks on a rental for something &quot;different&quot; and got this. I&apos;ve gone to the theaters and been far less impressed -- regardless of the $$$s spent or the $$$s made."

Then he explains that she is twenty-five-year-old, but intellectually disabled with mentality of a three-year-old child and nymphomaniac. Lambert and Mascaranti meet the former pimp Salvatore (Gigi Rizzi) to get information about the brothels in Milan and go deep in the underworld of sex to discover where Donatella is. Meanwhile her father continues his personal investigation about the fate of his daughter.\n\n&quot;La morte risale a ieri sera&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Death Occurred Last Night&quot; is a good thriller made in Italy. The plot has flaws, as usual, but the story is consistent and &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979) has a similar storyline. Raf Vallone has great performance and this unknown film is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Os Assassinos Só Matam aos Sábados&quot; (&quot;The Killers only Kill on Saturdays&quot;)",

Some of his films are even not particularly recommendable, I must admit (I think of Aldo Maccionne&apos;s infamous vehicles, for instance). But this title delivers far more than any French comedies fan could expect. We easily get fond of the characters and the plot evolves with some very funny gags and touching moments. Performance by the cast is more than satisfying and Henry Guybet certainly display some real talent here. Supporting actors are all great, Michel Galabru, Claude Jade, Claude Piéplu and Claude Dauphin... But the teenage actors also steal the show at times. A very sweet film I haven&apos;t seen in years and I highly recommend to anyone willing to spend a good moment watching a film. &quot;Le Pion&quot; rules!!!!",

After the armistice of the 8 th September 1943, Italys defeated army literally collapsed.Italy effectively had switched sides in the world war alliances,allied with USA against Nazi Germany,leaving many Italian army units in the lurch....and the Nazi German army invasion a few weeks later! Some units joined the the Anglo-Americans and valiantly fought with them,a few more joined the Fachist militias of the Salò regime in Northern Italy sustained by Nazi troops which together perpetuated massacres of civilians. However a large number of Italian army units,just melted like snow in a sunny spring day,disappearing or rather deserting in mass,prefering like the title of the film &quot;..to return home&quot;. The films spirit is basically about a strong desire of war weary soldiers to return back home to their families. Something which apparently would seem an easy task....but not in this film!!\n\nThis film retaining a deep tragic undertone has also some hilarious scenes of the more tragi-comical style,which was typical of the post neo-realistic film scripts of Italian cinema in the 1950&apos;s and 1960&apos;s,(The best period of Italian cinema).An absolute &quot;must see film&quot; for Italo-philes and fans of Italian cinema.Strangely enough,this film has never been much appreciated in Italy,and it is hard to find as video-cassette both for renting or buying.My vote 9.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this last month at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 23 films I saw there this year this would be in my top three. A delightful romantic comedy from writer/director Micha Lewinsky and co-written by Jan Preuss and Anna Luif this is a fun little film and well worth seeing. It likely will get distribution in American art house theaters. Rahal Hubli (Marie Leunberger) works as a civil registrar in the village courthouse and her primary function there is to conduct justice of the peace-type wedding ceremonies as it is one of the courthouse&apos;s biggest means of revenue. She has a mundane life and a mundane marriage to Thomas (Beat Marti) and is the mother of a son (Luca Majek). One day, her former boyfriend Ben Hofer (Dominique Jann) who also used to be her songwriting partner when they were a local duo, shows up with his glamorous girlfriend Tinka Panzer (Oriana Schrage) and announce they want to get married in a civil ceremony away from the limelight of the big city. Tinka is a famous actress and Ben is a fading rock star and the two of them are the glamor tabloid couple flavor of the week. Ben might revive his career with a marriage to Tinka but he still has feelings for Rahal that have reawakened. A great cast, especially Leunberger and a great supporting role from her co-worker (Jennifer Schmid). This is light fare and predictable but it works. And even though there may not be as much chemistry between Leunberger and Jann they do make a believable couple. Great use of supporting characters and a fast paced charming and witty story. Not too cerebral or too ridiculous and though not too full of belly laughs this is what a romantic comedy should be. Romantic and funny. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 and highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Although most of what we know about the Greek philosopher Pythagoras derives from sources written four hundred years after his death, he is regarded to have been a believer in the doctrine known as the transmigration of souls, the idea that the soul of man can reincarnate in different forms: as man, animal, vegetable, or mineral depending on one&apos;s karma. Referred to in Indian tradition as samsara, the idea of transmigration has recently been depicted in Apichatpong Weerasethakul&apos;s, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, where Boonmee&apos;s son is reborn as a monkey ghost and one of Boonmee&apos;s past lives is as an erotic talking catfish.\n\nThe doctrine that all things are part of the divine whether a tree, a lump of charcoal, an animal, or a human being is also dramatized in Le Quattro Volte, written and directed by Michelangelo Frammartino. Set in a small village in Calabria in Southern Italy where Pythagoras is said to have lived, Le Quattro Volte is a quietly meditative film that is divided into four sections separated by a blank screen. There is no narration or dialogue other than the dialogue of nature: the bleating of goats, the sheep bells, and the rush of wind blowing through the trees. Frammartino offers no clues or connections to the viewer as to what each segment represents. It is a film, he warns, in which &quot;the viewer must do all the work.&quot; As the film opens, an old man (Giuseppe Fuda), emerges out of the smoke rising from a charcoal kiln, tending to his goats in a pastoral setting that may not have changed for hundreds of years. The goat herder has a persistent cough that he tends to by exchanging goat&apos;s milk for dust on the floor of the local church and mixing it with a glass of water. When he realizes that his medicine has disappeared, he goes back to the church late at night but it is closed. Without his elixir, he dies the following morning in his bed surrounded by a herd of goats that made their way into his bedroom, one standing on the top of his table.\n\nTaking a page from Sergei Dvortsevoy&apos;s Tulpan, the scene shifts suddenly from the darkness of the old man&apos;s tomb to the birth of a live goat with its fluid being licked by its mother, a sequence that suggests the continuation of life. We follow the young kid as it grows steadily from taking its first steps to playing with other young goats. His development is interrupted, however, by a ten-minute sequence showing revelers taking part in a passion play celebrating Good Friday. Hilariously the old man&apos;s dog, after being chased off by villagers after annoying them with constant barking, retaliates by unblocking the wheels of their truck parked on a hillside causing it to roll down the hill, freeing a herd of goats enclosed in a pen.\n\nAs the goats are led through the forest, the baby goat becomes separated from the herd and wanders in the heavy brush until he lies down at the foot of a tall pine tree. With that, the film moves into another stage that shows the process of cutting down and stripping the tall tree. To complete the cycle, the tree is then made into a hut where wood and straw are converted into charcoal to provide heat for the winter, suggesting the oft-repeated phrase from The Book of Common Prayer, &quot;ashes to ashes, dust to dust.&quot; Lacking in what is generally considered to be drama or character identification,Le Quattro Volte can be slow going and abstract, a film that rarely engages the emotions, yet it has a serene and contemplative beauty that allows its message of the impermanence of life to become manifest. As Eric Benet put it in his well-known song Dust in the Wind, &quot;Don&apos;t hang on. Nothing lasts forever, but the earth and sky, it&apos;s there always and all your money won&apos;t another minute buy. Dust. . . all we are is dust in the wind. Dust in the windTime for the healing to begin.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to fairytale authors, Hans Christian Andersen and Brothers Grimm are in my mind the quintessential ones and penned a lot of timeless stories. Andersen penned &apos;The Tinderbox&apos; (&apos;Das Feuerzeug&apos; in German) and it from a young age has been one of my favourite and the most intriguing stories of his, especially the first bit with the witch, coins, tinderbox and dogs and have always found the soldier a rootable lead character.\n\nFind in general the East German fairy/folk tales absolutely fascinating and well worth watching. More should have been made and they should be better known, they do put a fair share of recent year adaptations to shame despite overtime technological advancement. &apos;Das Feuerzeug&apos; sadly is not one of the best, of these DEFA-distributed films it is my least favourite alongside &apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos;. Not because it&apos;s awful, it&apos;s not. It is tough to rate and review though, because my feelings are pretty conflicted.\n\n&apos;Das Feuerzeug&apos; mostly looks very well done. It&apos;s beautifully and atmospherically photographed, with some rich (light and dark) colours and un-complicated but charming sets, especially in the first half. The special effects are not elaborate or massive in scale but are well done all things considered. A better job could have been done with the witch perhaps, but a good job, and it was much harder to do, is done with the dogs&apos; differentiating sizes and eyes with one exception. Musically, it is not dissonant with what&apos;s going on and is pleasant on the ears in its own right.\n\nThat it follows the original story quite closely is to be admired, there are changes that don&apos;t harm the storytelling at all. Actually appreciated that the witch was made more threatning and her trickery more sinister, which to me was an improvement on her character. The script balances not getting too mature or too childish, so there is enough for both children and adults, and the first half of the story is imaginative and suspense, full of charm as well. Rolf Ludwig is a likeable soldier, while Maria Wendt shares the acting honours, being both sinister and fun. The dogs are far from tame and did appreciate that they were not made too scary.\n\nUnfortunately there are debits. Do agree that momentum and quality does dip towards the end. There are also exceptions to the well done quality of the visuals. The costumes are near-shoe-string like, they agreed overshot a bit with the witch and the eyes as big as dinner places brought unintentional humour (a shame because mostly the film did well with the dogs). The rest of the acting is not great, verging on overt pantomime as characters reduced to caricatures, where whether they were good or bad was laid on far too obviously. Barbara Mehlan lacks the allure and charm for the princess and one doesn&apos;t really get what the soldier sees in her.\n\nPace also slackens towards the end, with what was left of the material being padded out. So the film does get pretty dull and bland and the length being shortened by about 15 minutes would have helped things. Will admit that with the original story the early parts always have been more interesting to me and this film did nothing to change that for me.\n\nOn the whole, watchable but disappointing. 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "I love comedies, especially when they are dark like &quot;Head Above Water&quot;. I remember seeing this movie for the very first time about five years ago and it had me completely in its power. But in the meantime I&apos;ve seen so many good movies, that I wondered if this would still be as good as I remembered it to be. The answer is no, not completely. Yes, it is still a very nice movie, but not as great as some other dark comedies that I&apos;ve seen in the recent past.\n\nNathalie has recently been married to George, a prominent judge who she met when she had to stand trial. They now have taken a holiday in Nathalie&apos;s idyllic summerhouse in the middle of nowhere and the only person in the neighborhood is Nathalie&apos;s old friend and neighbor Lance, who joins them. When George and Lance go on a fishing trip, Nathalie&apos;s former lover turns up. He has a couple of drinks and then falls asleep in Nathalies bed ... naked. When George and Lance suddenly come back home, Nathalie panics. She tries to wake Lance up, but he&apos;s dead and the only idea she can come up with is hiding his body under the floor board, where he will soon be discovered...\n\nDespite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you&apos;ll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with. In fact, all actors did a good and convincing job portraying their characters, but it wasn&apos;t enough to make this movie a masterpiece. What bothered me most was the fact that it all started to go too far. All the characters had to die in such an unbelievable and over-the-top way, that it spoiled a lot of my fun. Nevertheless I must admit that I enjoyed big parts of the movie and that&apos;s why I still give it a 7/10. It&apos;s not the best example of a dark comedy, but I&apos;ve seen worse.",

The story is one we have seen many times before in many variations - terrorists take over a cruise ship and kill randomly, crew betrayals and heroic actions by a former cop (with a bitter past to add some depth to the character) to save the day are nothing new. A larger budget and better supporting actors would have made this lots better, but even so the no-wires-anywhere fight scenes are great despite the film&apos;s grade-Z budget, dumb stereotyped characters, and over-the-top slaughter-everyone violence. Worth a one-time see anyway.",

      "name": "Hitchcock&apos;s first film, a very good melodrama",
      "reviewBody": "At the age of 25, Alfred Hitchcock, who had been an assistant director to Michael Balcon, was given the chance to direct his first film, which was of course silent. It is very good and showed at once that he had talent. Assistant director on the film was a girl named Alma Reville, who was to become Hitchcock&apos;s wife and lifelong partner in all of his film projects. The film is based on a popular novel by &apos;Oliver Sandys&apos;, which was the pen name of a woman whose real name was Marguerite Jarvis, and who in this same year appeared as an actress under the name of Marguerite Evans in the comedy film STAGESTRUCK, with Gloria Swanson. The title of this film is the name of a music hall in London, where two girls are in the chorus together, and share a room in Brixton. The melodrama concerns the adventures of their lives and respective fates. The film was shot at Babelsburg Studios in Germany and had an international cast. The American actress Virginia Valli plays Patsy, the good girl of the two. And Jill, the girl who goes to the bad, is played by another American actress, Carmelita Geraghty. The German actor Karl Falkenberg plays the unpleasant and sinister Prince Ivan, who leads Jill astray. Falkenberg acted in 100 films between 1916 and 1936, after which he disappears from history. Probably he was Jewish, was banned from the screen by the Nazis, and then sent to a death camp. Possibly the best performance in the film is by British actor Miles Mander, who outdid Falkenberg by appearing in 107 films, between 1920 and 1947, including WUTHERING HEIGHTS (1939). In this film he plays a cad who married Patsy and then betrays her with a mistress and goes to pieces with drink and decadence. He delivers a very finely judged performance, and does not overact. Carmelita Geraghty is very convincing in her downward spiral into immorality, selfishness, and selling herself for fame and fortune. The film is not particularly creaky with age, and is well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "This charming film doesn&apos;t get the credit it deserves. It has a first-rate cast and tells its tale in a gentle and whimsical manner. Glenn Close plays Jan, a demure housewife possessed by the ghost of a twenties starlet flapper who died on the verge of her big break. As &quot;Maxie&quot; Close embodies the girl&apos;s longing to prove herself and see what might have been. Along for the ride is Mandy Patinkin as the hapless husband, Nick, who truly loves his wife, but is overwhelmed by Maxie and her zest for life. Also there, in her final picture, is Ruth Gordon, who was Maxie&apos;s dance partner in vaudeville and is now the landlady of the apartment building where Jan and Nick live. Gordon was always a scene stealer, but in this film she brings a fragility and tenderness to her role that is unlike any of her previous work. The scene were she comes face to face with Maxie for the first time in sixty years really brings a tear to your eye.\n\nThe critics excoriated the film, mostly complaining that it wasn&apos;t something other than what it was trying to be -a light and frothy bit of silliness that made you laugh and have a very pleasant hour and a half.",

The couple are presented in the film as very sensual, and the music and images that surround (and define) them are shared also by the viewer. The film touches on some interesting ideas, notably the not always chosen trade-off between freedom and belonging, and ends with a remarkable extended sequence depicting an Arab ritual of personal abandonment that bears comparison to (and is in fact more disturbing than) anything from &apos;The Exorcist&apos;. What it doesn&apos;t have is much of a conventional plot beyond the collage of sights and sounds; and the characters, though strongly-drawn, do not evolve dramatically over the course of the movie. It&apos;s still a striking piece of work; but fiction is being used here, rather than serving as an end in itself.",

Some college kids at the University of Central Florida stage a Midnight Madness of their own every year around the city of Orlando.  What a shame I go to the University of South Florida in Tampa!  \n\nThe movie just goes to show that you can watch a movie without gratuitous sex and violence and have a good time, even if you say to yourself, &quot;I saw that coming!&quot;  There is something to be said for movies like this and Cannonball Run..

THEN HOW DOES IT SEE INTO BUILDINGS?). Things that need explanations (like why people don&apos;t pull the trigger when they have a gun pointed at their enemy) don&apos;t get explained, probably because there is no rational explanation.\n\nEvery cliche in the book is on display here. The jocular banter between people is as bad as any 70&apos;s cop show. The action sequences are tired and overblown. In one ridiculous scene, just before the protagonist is set to die, a dove flies in through the door leaving the audience to wonder WHAT IN BLUE BLAZES?!?!?!\n\nHardly any of the main characters come off well. Uma Thurman looks about 50 years old for some reason. Ben Affleck can&apos;t act as usual. The scientist from Terminator 2 is in this playing some kind of bad-guy good-guy or something. I didn&apos;t bother thinking too hard about it.\n\nThe sad part is, I could see the brilliance of Philip K. Dicks story poking through the garbage once in a while. The premise is ingenious, but unfortunately every time it peeps its head out, John Woo takes a massive dump on it."

      "reviewBody": "Second round behind the camera for Kim Seok-yun after the film version of the TV series Old Miss Diary (2006), Detective K is a thrilling adventure in costume, split evenly between its atmosphere, awesome comic instincts and exciting action scenes. While not skimping some contortions of the script, it is able to give an evening of pure entertainment.\n\nThe story starts with an investigation as the title suggests, an infallible and bizarre investigator on a series of bizarre murders that could lead to a big conspiracy against the king. During its mission, the man comes across the mysterious disappearance of the widow of a wealthy family. With the help of a cute little thief, the detective discovers a branched network of intrigue that sometimes put his life to risk. And in all this,. There is beautiful Han, a merchant, seemingly cynical but with a mysterious past? The first few minutes, where the laughter and action scenes are fabulous. In fact in its development, the film opens in several points for reflection, inserting deep issues such as those of religion, and the struggle between social classes. Although never arriving to introspective essence of the drama, there are tense moments and deep, able to remove the apparent veneer of superficiality initially feared. Without detracting from the component it is naturally more playful and spectacular, that boasts a simple but successful compendium of special effects. The direction is impeccable and the cinematographer does his duty by offering magnificent views of places where reign of nature is supreme. Equal quality of the costumes, the colors are often bright transforming into the ancient world in a colorful reality.\n\nA noteworthy performance by Kim Myung-min, with a sober mustache, is totally unrecognizable from the time of Into the Mirror (2003) or even the recent Man of Vendetta (2010), the character is nuanced and full of melancholic irony. Dal-su Oh is an absolute comic relief.\n\nRecommended to action &amp; comedy genre lovers.",

In Ayla&apos;s case it is about different generations of Turkish emigrants in Germany.\n\nAyla is a young German girl of Turkish descent. She has been completely assimilated in German culture and customs, much to the chagrin of her father who has disowned her. She meets Ayhan, a Turkish-German photographer who has even greater problems relating to this cultural gap. His sister has left her husband in Turkey to live a free life in Germany. Ayhan&apos;s father has ordered him &amp; his brother to carry out an &quot;honor killing&quot; of their sister. Once Ayla and Ayhan start an intimate relationship, all these problems come to the foreground and make for an absorbing and thought-provoking film.\n\nAyla is a very topical movie. It is well crafted with natural performances and sensitive direction. Interestingly the actors portraying Ayla and Ayhan are both of Iranian origin! Well worth a look.",

      "name": "A near-classic film.",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d never heard of this film, but discovered it bundled in with a lot of other 30s/40s B-movies in the &quot;Mystery Classics&quot; collection from Platinum Video. It&apos;s a surprisingly good film, really a near-great film that&apos;s hobbled a bit by it&apos;s middle act.\n\nThe first part of the film is really the only part that&apos;s a straight-forward detective romp, w/ a blind detective and his seeing-eye-dog and his hired muscle simpleton helping him sleuth out a fairly typical wrongfully-accused-murder plot. This part of the film is all golden, partially, I think, because the Detective&apos;s characters (All intended to be recurring characters in an ongoing film franchise that never quite got off the ground after this really good first chapter) feel like they have a past together, they feel like they know who they are, which is unusual for a potboiler of this era.\n\nThe second act resolves the murder a bit too quickly - in fact, it&apos;s never exactly resolved, the film merely abruptly changes focus from the detective et al to the murderers themselves discussing why they did it. This robs the film of most of it&apos;s dramatic strength, and essentially the middle act becomes little more than filler. It&apos;s entertaining enough filler - a sort of World War II version of &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; - but it doesn&apos;t really advance the plot much.\n\nThe third act is the somewhat-rushed climax/resolution, though it features an unexpectedly cool shootout filmed in a very unusual style, and extended sequence with the detective&apos;s amazingly-well-trained dog. (Seriously, this dog is great! He could easily do his own taxes. He makes any other trained film dog - and really most trained film monkeys - look like idiots by comparison). On the whole, the film ends well, but it never fully recovers the momentum it lost by shifting focus in the middle, and as a result the final wrap up just comes across as slightly unsatisfying. It is, however, a more than satisfying introduction to what no doubt would have been a great detective series which, sadly, never really took off. I&apos;m very surprised the concept was never revisited on TV or Radio, since the central character is endlessly entertaining.\n\nOne odd note: the ending feels a bit truncated, with some of the action happening off-camera. For instance, early on one of the bad guys is captured and held by the detective&apos;s men. Later on, we&apos;re shown the detective&apos;s men bound and gagged, the bad guy having evidently escaped. Later the bad guy reunites with his own people, but the transition is so abrupt that it feels like we&apos;re missing a scene or two. Also, there&apos;s a subplot in which the bad guys are hiding family information from one of their own people. This sets up what is obviously intended to be a major plot point, but, in the end absolutely nothing comes of it. Again, is this a missing scene, or simply bad writing? I can&apos;t tell.\n\nStill and all, this is a near-classic film with a great character and some fantastic performances that unfortunately hobbles itself. Well worth a viewing, however."

There are indeed a few similarities to &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;, and at first I thought &quot;Crazy&quot; to be just some kind of a German copy of it. But then I found, it is mainly the realism and the straightness that is similar to FA; and I consider this as a new European style. Most of the feelings and emotions of this film have also appeared in my youth, and they most probably will in all upcoming generations, too. So, the film is very catching for everybody, especially males, who have been a teenager. Some of the people in the audience even shed a tear at certain moments. The only thing I thought to be a little unrealistic and even annoying is the way the sixteen year old boys seemed to think about god. I would think that most boys of that age, unless being raised in a strict religious environment, talk about god in a less reflected way. But maybe this is a typical Bavarian phenomena, or the producers wanted to push chances of receiving an US-American academy award.",

Is a beautiful one!:) Movie is very inspiring, like a book, opens many questions to re-think about life and universe. Definitely sometimes imdb rating is not so relevant to say if a movie is good, this one is underrated.\n\nThey changed a bit movie plot compared to the book... so I strongly recommend book reading before watching!\n\nEnjoy this beautiful story this or that way!",

      "reviewBody": "A warrior named Deathstalker is sent on a quest by a witch to find a chalice, an amulet, and a sword, soon he finds himself making new allies whilst battling warriors, creatures and a wizard.\n\nOff the back of Conan the Barbarian (1982) director James Sbardellati&apos;s (credited as John Watson) offering is in the vein of The Sword and the Sorcerer (1982) but lacks the scope. Writer Howard R. Cohen&apos;s adult orientated plot is paper thin.\n\nModelled on He-man Rick Hill (with a mix of Peter Weller and Dolphin Lundgren) does a good enough job as Deathstalker. Wearing very little the late Lana Clarkson steals the show. Richard Brooker as Oghris is notable. Gratuitous nudity galore, unnecessary rape, produced by Roger Corman it has all the production pitfalls you&apos;d expect, including cheap sets and choppy editing, but is high in concept and is entertaining for the most part. Óscar Cardozo Ocampo&apos;s music raises the production and staged fight scenes, even if a little intrusive at times. The giant pig-man gladiator fight scene setup is a highlight even if nothing like the promotional art. Also the showdown is interesting even if borrowed from Superman II (1980) where Flash Gordon&apos;s Ming-like sorcerer Munkar played by Bernard Erhard gets to shine a little.\n\nOverall, it takes itself seriously, it&apos;s violent, with wall to wall scantily-clad leads and extras. It has a strange appeal, oozing low budget eighties sword and sorcery shenanigans. One of the better Conan cash-ins, even if the poster art is better than the film."

      "reviewBody": "One Night At McCool&apos;s:\n\nI recently began to wonder how long it had been since a movie had really made me laugh.  Not just smile, but bust a gut, wipe tears out of my eyes, clutch my side, think I&apos;m going to stop breathing, roar with laughter. Frighteningly enough I realized it had been months.  Ever since &quot;There&apos;s Something About Mary&quot;, directors and writers have equated super gross-out with funny.  However, the recent spate of disastrous &quot;comedies&quot; -  &quot;Tomcats&quot; and &quot;Freddie Got Fingered&quot; instantly come to mind- have hopefully shown just how wrong this thinking is.   Does anyone in Hollywood remember how to make a good comedy?   I&apos;m still undecided.\n\nJewel is the kind of woman that every man wishes for: tall, gorgeous, aggressive and a &quot;demon in the sack&quot;.  Unfortunately as the saying goes, if something seems too good to be true  Jewel&apos;s charms are backed up by a penchant for philandering, double cross and murder.  After one night at a back street dive of a bar, three unlucky men - a bartender, a lawyer and a police officer - learn what it&apos;s like to have there prayers and worst nightmares come true when they&apos;re caught up in her whirlwind.\n\n &quot;One Night at McCool&apos;s&quot; plays like the Japanese classic &quot;Rashomon&quot; -different people recount their experiences of the same event and we&apos;re never quite sure which one to believe.  This movie marks the breakout performance of Liv Tyler both literally and figuratively - as Jewel she is practically spilling out of her clothing, and abandons her innocent persona delivering one of the best vixen performances in recent memory.  She is positively wicked.   Matt Dillon is enjoyable as the pitiable sop who, although his life is destroyed by her conniving, can&apos;t seem to let her go. Paul Reiser manages not to be too annoying as a sleazy lawyer, while John Goodman, who seems to be wheezing through his lines, is quite distracting. Michael Douglas&apos; turn as a slimy coifed contract killer with an agenda all his own is quite amusing and you want to take a shower every time he is onscreen.  Andrew Dice Clay (remember him?) and Reba McEntire round out the cast with decent performances.\n\nAside from the aforementioned movie reference, &quot;One Night at McCool&apos;s&quot; borrows liberally from such classic films as   &quot;Coolhand Luke&quot; and &quot;Falling Down&quot;. While I enjoyed these and other manipulations, the movie spends a little too much time trying to be clever and consequently suffers from several noticeable lulls.  What I found most disappointing however was the &quot;surprise&quot; ending that many people have commented on - although I did laugh at it, the effect would have been much greater if it had not been  revealed in the trailers (on the off chance you have not seen them, I will say no more)!!  I laughed nonetheless.\n\n &quot;McCool&apos;s&quot; succeeds largely because it is subtle, well acted and most importantly, funny.",

This was the last of the so-called &quot;college comedies&quot; that began with the classic &quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot;, continued with the two &quot;Merlin Jones&quot; films (&quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; and &quot;The Monkey&apos;s Uncle&quot;) and ended with the three &quot;Dexter Riley&quot; films (&quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot;, &quot;Now You See Him, Now you Don&apos;t&quot; and this film). These films all followed the same formula but still were funny in their own way. However, by the time this film was done the formula had worn thin and this pretty much was the end of the line for this series of films. Kurt Russell was his usual funny self as the perpetually in trouble Dexter getting himself and his buddy Schyler in perpetual trouble. Ceasar Romero was also great as the kids&apos; perpetual foil Arno.\n\nHowever, it is also a somewhat surreal film due to the fact that Joe Flynn died after this motion picture finished filming. He definitely was great in his role as Dean Higgins and it was definitely an extension of his &quot;Captain Binghamton&quot; character and this capped off his legendary career as on of the all-time great curmudgeons."

It is a respectable effort with Woolsey playing a carnival con-man and his adopted daughter trying to fit in with the high society of a small town.  This film has many laughs, but the primary difference between this and the other Wheeler/Woolsey films is that it is not afraid to stick dramatic moments into the comedy as well as treating the characters played by Woolsey and Anita Louise as real people instead of slapstick/cartoon characters.  I generally liked this movie (being a fan of Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, I usually like all their movies). However, Woolsey&apos;s abrasive comic personality is sometimes hard to take for a long period of time, even in this 67 minute film.  This film would have worked a lot better had he been able to vent his jokes onto a comic foil, a role which Wheeler usually would have played.  The video I have this movie on was taped off of Turner Classic Movies several years ago and features clear sound and very clear picture quality.",

I remember hearing about it six years ago, but was in the UK at the time and never saw it.\n\nNutley took the Swedish spirit and gave it back to the people early on with short &apos;stilleben&apos; shoots of Stockholm and its people and made an impression. &apos;House of Angels&apos; (or whatever it&apos;s called in the English language version) was his first major film in Sweden and one of the biggest box offices ever.\n\nThe rental we had preserved the wide screen, which is absolutely essential in this context. Nutley has a knack for finding pastorals which are incredible, and Swedes really suck this up. The images themselves are so stunning and evocative to the local populace that this in itself is enough soul candy.\n\nNutley is of course together with his perennial leading lady today, and they have two or three children together, and in a clumsy event she was voted best Swedish actress of all time, ahead of Bergman and Garbo, but there is no discounting her talent or on-screen presence. Beautiful in a flawless way she may not be, but her on-screen charisma and meticulous acting are impressive.\n\nSimple story? Yes, perhaps, but it&apos;s not only the plot you come to watch: it&apos;s the pictures themselves. Why watch Olof chop wood when you can film him from inside the house and show a bit of the window frame at the same time? Some of the pictures are so carefully laid out it&apos;s fantastic.\n\nAnd the story itself: with acting this good, and with directing this good, you&apos;re going to find yourself moved and watery-eyed at the end no matter what.\n\nI was surprised to find this movie won and was nominated for so many awards. I remember at the time critics in Sweden panning it. But I must have got this wrong. &apos;Under Solen&apos; is a tour de force, a work of art, by a Brit who has captured the soul and spirit of Sweden like few others. A &apos;must see&apos;."

      "reviewBody": "The apprentice is Matthieu Bulle, a tall, gangly 15-year-old boy in an agricultural high school with divorced parents who divides his classes half-time apprenticing with a dairy farmer named Paul Barbier, in the Haut-Doubs region of France, close to the Swiss border. The boy learns, and he and Paul bond.\n\nThis film reminded me of Nicolas Philibert&apos;s superb 2002 documentary To Be and To Have, and also of a significant passage of my own early life. Like Philibert&apos;s film, Collardey&apos;s is about French education in a rural farming area (mostly dairy) up near the French Alps. Like this boy Matthieu Bulle, I had a kind of apprenticeship in my teens that supplied me with a surrogate much needed second father.\n\nI also thought of the Dardenne brothers&apos; powerful The Son/Le fils (also 2002), about another, far more intense (and more fictional) apprenticeship. These are all variations in documentary technique. The Italian neorealists used &quot;real&quot; people as actors. The Dardennes have done that, in part--though Olivier Gourmet and Jérémie Renier are certainly professional actors, of the first order.\n\nCollardey&apos;s way of working was marked by a certain stateliness and beauty. He used 35 mm. cameras that required some formal setup time--not tiny DV ones. His shots are sequential and carefully chosen. The images are beautiful, sharp, spacious at times, full of light and air. &quot;I have been greatly influenced by Courbet,&quot; he said in an interview with Claire Vassé, &quot;who, incidentally, was born in Ormans, the town I live in. Courbet&apos;s revolution consisted in dedicating large formats, until then reserved for religious scenes, to more trivial scenes featuring peasants... As a rule, 35 mm. reels are only for actual film actors; but I use them to film Matthieu, Martine (the boy&apos;s mother--CK) and Paul, and film the way they speak. I felt like making them full-fledged film characters.&quot; By the way, apropos of Courbet, Matthieu in talking to classmates defines himself as a &quot;paysan,&quot; a peasant, rather than a &quot;cultivateur.&quot; This boy and his classmates don&apos;t seem to want to be modern agriculturalists &quot;running&quot; a farm.\n\nIs this a pure &quot;film,&quot; or a documentary? Isn&apos;t this distinction artificial? The people and events are &quot;real.&quot; Collardey selected Paul, a man who has had apprentices before, and seemed like a nice man who doesn&apos;t exploit them. When the director was looking for a boy for his film Matthieu, without being chosen by the principal, came knocking on his door, told an emotional story, and his freshness and volatility won him the &quot;part.&quot; Collardey films him giving a class presentation, drinking, dancing, swimming, roughhousing in the locker room with his classmates, meeting once with his absent dad, taking finals, and arguing more than once with his mom. But his main interest was Matthieu&apos;s interactions with Paul as he helps herd the cows, cuts wood, shares a secret, sleds and trades snowballs, or gets dressed down by Martine for cleaning out cobwebs when he should have been helping her milk the cows. In several memorable solo moments, Matthieu struggles with guitar chords and gives himself up to a song, singing at the top of his lungs off key with total abandon, wearing headphones when Paul&apos;s away as he sweeps out the stable.\n\nCollardey set up that dressing-down, suggested the time for it and set up the shot. But he knew it was going to come.\n\nI think what makes this a fine film is the other dimensions provided by the spontaneity of the boys&apos; scenes as they grab-ass in the shower, pop beer caps and sing a drinking song; when Matthieu pleads with his girlfriend, dances with her and kisses her; or speculates with his best friend about sex and women&apos;s bodies when they&apos;re both standing immersed at the edge of the swimming pool. To have kept it this natural in all these different setting of a young boy&apos;s life and never faltered from the handsome 35 mm. images is a technical and aesthetic accomplishment that is also an act of patience, humanism, and sympathy. It reaches its quiet emotional peak when Paul admits to Matthieu he lost a son at an early age and has never gotten over it. He&apos;s a tight-lipped countryman and doesn&apos;t have to say, as my teacher did to me, that Matthieu is the son he might have had.\n\nCollardey grew up on a farm too, and also lost his father when he was 13 and felt the lack Matthieu suffers because he&apos;s given up on his dad and rarely sees him. Collardey&apos;s not approaching as a neutral observer. Nor can you. If you find the idea of toiling on a small farm, or nurturing a teenager with some emotional issues and a squeaky voice unappealing, forget it. But this won the Critics Week prize in Venice. Another fine documentary about rural life not shown here, Raymond Dupeyron&apos;s Vie moderne, won the prestigious Louis-Delluc Prize, for which The Apprentice/L&apos;Apprenti as well as Cantet&apos;s The Class, Desplechin&apos;s A Chrismas Tale and Assayas&apos; Summer Hours were finalists. Previous Louis-Delluc winners were Secret of the Grain the year before; To Be and To Have in 2002. So, tough competition, and The Apprentice isn&apos;t quite at the the level of care and intensity of To Be and To Have. But it won the Louis Dellac Best First Film prize. And t&apos;s beautiful work, its marriage of humble subject matter and visual grandeur quite special, and one should not be distracted by the boy&apos;s adolescent stumbles and the alleged &quot;reality-TV&quot; moments from recognizing this Femis graduate&apos;s demonstrated humanity and command of a medium that he transcends and redefines in ways that are both classic and contemporary.\n\nReleased December 3, 2008 in France.

      "reviewBody": "After a period of amazing experimentation in the 30s, the detective genre settled into a few tracks. One of these consisted of series films with previously well known characters, usually from radio. Some actually pretended to have a mystery, while others like this did not. The main appeal was supposed to be in the characters and their traits. \n\nBoston Blackie&apos;s character is one of the more endearing, which allowed the extremely low budget production room to continue.\n\nBlackie is a successful thief, one of those charming, superclever types that appeared in the 20s and early 30s. Blackie stole because the rich deserved it, pure and simple, not out of selfish greed, and in fact his story always mentions how he gave the proceeds to the starving. He was one of the inventions we created during the last period where the difference in the wealthy and poor was immense.\n\nBy this time (1941) he had been reinvented. Now he was a retired thief, with his cleverness turned to solving crimes the police were too dumb to understand. Along the way, the police (always the same guy) would suspect Blackie of the crime. So in addition to outwitting the criminals  which was ordinary in such movies  he had to more severely and embarrassingly outwit the police. That&apos;s the added piece here.\n\nHis two sidekicks are runt, a Runyon-esquire character, and Arthur, a rich but clueless playboy. Arthur is important because he anchors the political reinvention handily. He always has enough money which is freely available for Blackie&apos;s escapades.\n\nI&apos;ve only seen a couple of these, but this has something a bit extraordinary. Quite independent of any story element or need, we have a thread inserted. One of Blackie&apos;s affairs has resurfaced, a tall tough redheaded moll, who claims to be married to him and wants money... &quot;or else.&quot;\n\nIts a strange episode, obviously inserted to tell us something about Blackie that is expected to build his appeal and thus the franchise. He&apos;s a wisecracking guy clever guy who (almost) never resorts to violence. He&apos;s slick and chatty. But we get the idea here that in the bedroom he can master this wild amazon. Because in the US, we were deep in the stupid prurient code, there had to be this amazingly indirect way of telling us this.\n\nI suppose its important, and that it worked. Blackie lasted for 15 films.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

      "reviewBody": "+ A good mix between classic Wu-Xiapian movies and time-travel humor. It never fails to deliver laughs or to impress with witty action. Scrolls, seals, ideograms and magic tricks dispensed by the terrific cast are used to serve both the action and the comic relief. No flashy CGI it&apos;s cool and discrete. (The audience burst in laughs when they did the old school &apos;white smoke&apos; metamorphosis trick.)\n\n\n* The film lacks a good editing though (a recurrent handicap in Korean movies). Despite the great acting of the cast, it tends to slow down when trying to develop the very secondary female characters. This is probably due to the presence of many Korean movie stars who always insist to get a lot of screen time for their characters even if that doesn&apos;t serve the storyline.\n\n\nI&apos;ll give it a 8 because of all the good laughs and this very refreshing and magical atmosphere the movie provides. While Korea&apos;s grown famous for pushing to export crappy CGI movies out of sheer patriotism but this isn&apos;t one of them. Woochi actually delivers.",

In &quot;Big Jake,&quot; he wasas alwaysa powerful presence and one of the screen&apos;s most efficient scene-stealer \n\nGeorge Sherman&apos;s &quot;Big Jake&quot; was the Duke fifth and final film played opposite the lovely redheaded Maureen O&apos;Hara who plays, here, his wife Martha McCandles \n\nThe movie opens in 1909 where nine men crossing the Rio Bravo into Texas Their leadera sadistic gunrunnerJohn Fain (Richard Boone) is ready for his bloody McCandles&apos; raid where ten people were slaughtered and Big Jakes&apos;s grandson, the 8-year-old Little Jacob (Ethan Wayne) is kidnapped, and a ransom note is left demanding one million dollars in $20 Bills for Jacob&apos;s safe return \n\nMarthaquite sure that this job requires an extremely harsh and special kind of man to attend it called back her husband, absent for many years, to pay the ransom, and take back home the little boy alive \n\nJacob McCandles (Wayne)who has never seen his grandsonresponds to his wife&apos;s call and organizes a hunting party to track down the dangerous and violent men \n\nWith his two sons, his faithful Indian scout (Bruce Cabot), his loyal dog, and with a large red strongbox packed to the back of a good mule, McCandles initiates his very daring hunt \n\nThere are some hard feelings among Wayne&apos;s resentful boys, and as the film progresses, Wayne&apos;s blue eyes were gentle and revealing a wonderful caring father but also his eyes turn to blue steel as he took that decision to get alive his grandson The heart of the film is Wayne interacting with his wife and what he has in store for his sons next...\n\nPatrick Wayne plays Wayne&apos;s older son who is short on ears and long on mouth Christopher Mitchum rides a &apos;crazy bicycle,&apos; carries a Bergman 1911, and a rifle with one fancy new telescope...\n\nWith great action scenes, great photography and with a terrific Elmer Bernstein musical score, &quot;Big Jake&quot; is one of Wayne best Westerns",

      "reviewBody": "Willi Forst works at an art shop. He&apos;s called on to cover the Mona Lisa with glass to prevent its degradation. It&apos;s just another job, until he gets to look at the painting close up, then handle it, and then he&apos;s in love. He buys a copy and hangs it in his room. He spots Trude von Molo, a chambermaid, and is struck by her resemblance to the painting, and makes a play for her. He is neither rich nor famous, so she says no. So Forst decides to do something big: steal the real painting.\n\nIt&apos;s based on the real theft of the Mona Lisa in 1910. Before then, it wasn&apos;t the most famous painting in the world, just another well-regarded example of Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s work. Its theft made it famous, and rumors went about that it had been stolen by agents of J. P. Morgan or the Kaiser.\n\nIt makes a pleasant, mild comedy. Director Géza von Bolváry cannily does without much dialogue; Forst doesn&apos;t say a word until a dozen minutes in, even though others do, His silence gives him an air of anomie, and forces the audience to concentrate on his performance, and the moment he falls in love with the painting.\n\nThe real thief of the Mona Lisa, Vicenzo Peruggia, spent eight months in prison for the theft. Then the Great War broke out and everyone forgot about it, except that the Mona Lisa was now the most famous painting in the world.",

      "reviewBody": "With no laughs but with important messages, &quot;Gung Ho&quot; manages to be a reflexive entertainment about the cultural and economical clashes of two nations when they join forces to rise from the ashes an automobile factory that can be the only hope of saving a town. Michael Keaton plays an American executive who gets the job of rescuing such factory with a new leadership coming from Japan with a desperate executive (Gedde Watanabe) trying to save his career from potential failure. The latter&apos;s task is to command the American plant and their workers, accustomed to work in a particular way, trying impose the Oriental methods of working for long hours for the benefit of the company and such clashes with the interests of Keaton who&apos;s trying to look good before his friends who aren&apos;t used to such working journey. \n\nBut let&apos;s face it: the movie isn&apos;t funny. Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz are terrific writers (&quot;Splash&quot;, &quot;Parenthood&quot;) but they didn&apos;t create much moments we could say they were funny, most of the time is just using of caricatures to make some amusing moments, they barely work, maybe two or three scenes. Their concentration to the more engaging aspects was what made &quot;Gung Ho&quot; something really worth seeing. It pokes fun on the culture comparisons between U.S., specially when it comes to both nations traditions but it also establishes a greater sense of supporting each other, one might be better than the other but only together they come up with something bigger, better and stronger. Having a movie like this made on a decade where American superiority was presented in every single movie and also in politics is something of a miracle. It basically says: &quot;We&apos;re no longer the strongest nation in the world, neither the most efficient but we can aspire to be if we follow some other examples around the world&quot;. Sure, it doesn&apos;t paint a fair picture for both sides (Japanese as workaholics who can&apos;t contest their bosses and Americans as lazy and incompetent), often recurring to stereotypes but presents something good out of those. \n\nAlthough a little sloppy, clichéd and never serious enough, &quot;Gung Ho&quot; can be used as a source of inspiration, at least for those who have a company and doesn&apos;t know how to bring out the best with their employs, it&apos;s always there to bring out of the best of a team, push them to the limits and show them the advantages of following new directives. I know this movie is something of a classic between Administration students in here, and most of them enjoy it. Out of this department, it might be a disappointment for Keaton and Ron Howard fans, they&apos;re not at their best. The supporting cast formed with the likes of Mimi Rogers, George Wendt, John Turturro, Rance and Clint Howard save this for a bit, but the most interesting in scene is Watanabe, the funniest in the show. \n\nIn the end, it reaches its purpose of presenting a parallel between cultures, but never takes our fully enjoyment, neither much of our laughs. Easy to watch and quite motivational though. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The only thing this film has going for it is catching all the great actors, at the start of their careers) that are in smaller roles as the sailors on board - James Farentino, a skinny James Coco, Larry Hagman, George Lindsay, Dick Gautier and even a young Jack Nicholson! OK Walter Matthau is worth watching in anything he does, but that is all. The rest of the film is another Josh Logan homo-erotic mess. Yes, it is. He seems to have spent more time on the scenes where the sailors get together and have fun dancing in their underwear, whacking each other on the butt, running around with no shirts and skimpy shorts and there is even a scene where one sailor, as they sit and listen to the radio, has one arm draped over another guys leg. The rest of the story is like the boat they are on - old, rusty and goes no where. The worst is Robert Walker(who should have kept the Jr after his name)who does his best to do a perfect Jack Lemmon impersonation and that gets irritating as you wonder why they didn&apos;t get Jack himself. He probably read the script.",

The original movie had a lot to say and didn&apos;t go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.\n\nThis version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.\n\nThere was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; reflects, in many ways, what&apos;s wrong with our society. We watch in disbelief as more and more CEOs are hauled up to jail and how these unscrupulous people leave their once valued employees to fend for themselves, as best they can.\n\nDan Perisot directs this remake of the 1977 Jane Fonda-George Segal vehicle and brings it up to date. He counts with two actors that are popular to present this new installment in a funny way, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni in the main roles.\n\nPoor Dick finds out in the worst way the job he held has just disappeared and must face reality. Dick and Jane must deal with their sudden status as they see their electricity cut, their housekeeper deserts them and Dick suffers the indignity of having to compete with other unemployed, former colleagues, for jobs that aren&apos;t half as glamorous as the vice-presidency he almost had.\n\nWhat&apos;s a desperate man to do? Well, being a resourceful man, he must do what he has to. Jane and Dick start a path into taking the law into their own hands. \n\nIn a way, Mr. Carrey, one of the producers, mixes a serious problem with his kind of comedy. Jim Carrey is one of the best comedians working in movies today, but he also has an enormous talent for doing some serious dramatic work, as he has already proved. He is a dynamo in the film and turns the situation Dick is facing into fun, in his own way.\n\nTea Leoni, is equally suited to play Jane, the travel agent who suddenly sees all those comforts she was used to, disappear, and must adapt to her new circumstances. Ms. Leoni and Mr. Carrey do some funny things together, making the film look much better than what could have been. The supporting players, mainly Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins make good contributions to the film.\n\n&quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; is a typical example of those holiday themed films the studios love to unload at the end of the year.",

The film describes a number of &apos;firsts&apos; (many Russian, some American) and failures (many American, some Russian) in lunar exploration, which are historically quite interesting. Notably, there are numerous women shown to have contributed to Soviet space science. There is a lot of physics explained in accessible ways, sometimes illustrated by entertaining cartoons (I liked to explanation about the fuel-to-payload ratios - if you want to go to the moon verses if you want to land on the moon verses if you want to land on the moon and return). The film ranges from deep and dry to light-hearted and amusing. There is even a touch of self-referential whimsey as the sighting of life on Mars includes spotting Aelita, the central character in the first Russian sci-fi film: the silent pean to interplanetary workers revolution: &apos;Aelita, Queen of Mars&apos; (1924). The last third of the film is the most fun, as a potential future of lunar exploration and colonisation is depicted, including discussions of on-site production of oxygen and the conversion of caves to pressurised shelters. The miniature work and special effects are nicely done (reminding me of the excellent silent Russian space epic 1936&apos;s &apos;Cosmic Journey&apos;). All-in-all, Pavel Klushantsev&apos;s &apos;Luna&apos; should find an appreciative audience in anyone interested in the history of space exploration or in Russian sci-fi or speculative-documentary films.",

The ensemble cast is good, but these are caricatures rather than real people, and larger than life doesn&apos;t really describe the huge egos and outlandish behaviour filling the screen. I&apos;ve never liked Knightley, but she&apos;s probably at her best here, given the chance to do something other than period dramas; Mickey Rourke is gravely and tough, continuing the career rehabilitation begun with SIN CITY; Christopher Walken shines in a supporting role.\n\nBut the script is all over the place and the attempts at comedy sit ill with the main thrust of the story – long, unnecessary segments including the Jerry Springer one just drag the film down and scream self-indulgence. By the end, I neither knew nor cared about any of the cardboard characters in this headache-inducing movie, just longing for it to be over.",

Sophie Marceaux plays the mystic lady and you never know whether she really is good or bad. Not even when the movie is over.\n\nWhat is a quite intelligent psychological drama, turns into a violent outburst. Anyway it&apos;s nice to watch such a plot in another environment; here the French Côte d&apos;Azur. But it&apos;s too physical in the end and maybe the plot maker hasn&apos;t had any real good ideas about how to finish it.",

It&apos;s lighthearted and funny, and it was fun to watch a movie all about old time baseball as a big fan of modern baseball. The love story is basic, but worked in well, not overwhelming the baseball aspect of the movie. The fact that his love interest is the team manager&apos;s sister-in-law is interesting. And I liked the fact that the other players are always playing rookie pranks on him even though he is a young phenom. Definitely not a serious drama, and I don&apos;t think it would be hard to follow or &quot;get&quot; for someone who&apos;s not a sports fan as some of the newer baseball movies are. It&apos;s a great movie for a Sunday when your home team was rained out. I recommended this one to my baseball-loving friends.",

The story is about a young woman, Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) with emotional problems who cannot find her place in the world. She is self-destructive. But when she sees the want ads one day, she is inspired to take her typing certification and seek office employment.\n\nShe meets an off-beat attorney, Mr. Grey (James Spader), who hires her. And they develop an unusual work relationship that becomes more personal.\n\nKudos to Ms. Gyllenhaal for a brave performance. Lee is complex but accessible for viewer understanding because of her wonderfully nuanced portrayal. Grey is not as transparent, and it feels like that is intentional. It would be interesting to ask viewers which character is more damaged/dysfunctional.\n\nThis is not comedy in the broad style, but a comedy of small moments. At the same time, it is incumbent on the viewer to recognize the pain and dysfunctions that are on the screen. The result is a thoughtful film.",

By the time he reaches the house she has died and her jealous father (Ernest Borgnine) makes him leave with their newborn son. Without the resources to take care of the child, it dies and soon the soldier sets out for revenge. This film has a great revenge story going for it but by the time it ended I was pretty mad at the movie because it could have been so much better. The film has several subplots and none of them are as interesting as the revenge story so these subplots get in the way and in the end they really pull the film back some. The film&apos;s main story is still good enough to make this worth watching as it features some great action sequences as well as two good performances by the leads. Hilton is very good in his mainly silent role and Borgnine delivers a maniac style performance. The ending is very strange and bizarre but it works well with the film even though the revenge takes a few different turns."

Additionaally, such a rig would have been swiftly detected and localized by Radio Direction Finding (RDF) equipment. All underground radio transmitter operations had to be moved from one place to another as swiftly as possible to avoid detection by RDF.\n\nThe suggestion that Heinrich Himmler had a sense of honor and therefore kept his word to Krausenberg is not only beyond ridiculous but it also attempts at a saving grace to a completely dishonorable and without scruples man.

Even though this film was made a quarter century ago, its effect is still as powerful and its message still as important. I have always supported programs like Scared Straight because there are some kids who don&apos;t respond to kindness. To all those bleeding heart people who think these convicts were so mean to these kids, just remember they didn&apos;t get there for being boy scouts. Good kids don&apos;t go into someone&apos;s prison. One of the lifers told the group that if someone had talked to him like that he wouldn&apos;t be in prison. Another lifer tells the group that the police can make a thousand mistakes but you can only make one. The speaker that scared the kids the most was this one guy named Ali. He had a loud screeching voice and seemed the most angry of the convicts. He told the kids &quot;I&apos;m here for murder, kidnapping, armed robbery...&quot;. He showed them his eye was missing, taken right out of its socket in a prison fight. I feel the convicts &quot;in your face&quot; approach was the right thing to do. They had experimented before with a kinder gentler approach, and guess what folks it didn&apos;t work! The kids actually wanted to go back to the prison because they thought that the convicts were a nice bunch of guys! I watched interviews they did with those kids before they went into Rahway and I wanted to slap the snot out of some of them at the things they were saying. I was thinking to myself, what a bunch of punks! I&apos;ll tell you this, they didn&apos;t act like that after it was all over. In 1998, they did a follow up special called Scared Straight Twenty Years Later. Danny Glover was the host of it. It profiled the kids and the convicts. Only two of the group that went to Rahway for the documentary became career criminals. One was in prison and one had died. The others were useful and productive members of society. None were rocket scientists, they had mostly blue collar jobs, but the point is they had lived honest lives and all of them talked of how greatful they were for the program and what it did for them. Three of the lifers had died (one of natural causes, one of AIDS and one of an overdose). Two of them were still in prison and the rest had been released and had lived honestly since. The one with the missing eye was so different. They interviewed him and he seemed like such a nice old guy. He had a beautiful family and said he had everything he wanted and that he loved himself. It was wonderful to see."

This far removed from the Cold War, it&apos;s hard to remember what a threat the Soviet Union was, the incredible evil which she served as vanguard. This film was fairly leftish, seeing accommodation with the USSR as the ultimate good, and confrontation as the ultimate bad. (Sort of a hangover from the demonstrably dumb Nuclear Freeze Movement of the mid &apos;80&apos;s) Must have been embarrassing three years later. Tommy Lee Jones and Dennis Franz were totally adequate here. Pam Grier seemed a lot more professional, and a lot prettier, than in the blaxploitation stuff I remember her from. And Joanna Cassidy was great. She played her role intense and low-key at the same time. And what can you say about Gene Hackman. Amazing, the career he&apos;s had, looking like that. He is the consummate professional actor, and of course, he had to be. I&apos;ve never seen him in ANY role that he didn&apos;t pull off with seeming effortlessness. (Although I will say, that seeing him in the car scenes seemed to almost be a teensy bit of a self-parody) But some of the plot were a bit big. This one is worth checking out on cable, or a Netflix rental.",

      "name": "A Byomkesh Story, Conceived By The Creator Of Feluda",
      "reviewBody": "(Reviewed on the basis of watching on T.V. 36 years after release)\n\nPlot: An ex-judge Nishanath Sen, invites the famous sleuth Byomkesh Bakshi and his associate Ajit to his residential colony. The colony is inhabited by peculiar people most of whom are social outcasts; and hence has got the name &apos;chiriyakhana&apos; (zoo). Nishanath also asks Byomkesh to inquire about all the details of a singer-cum-heroine of an erstwhile Bengali film. Soon, news arrives that Nishanath has been brutally murdered in his colony. Will Byomkesh be able to nab the culprit from among the weird residents of the &apos;chiriyakhana&apos;?\n\nReview:Byomkesh Bakshi, the dhoti-panjabi clad Bangalee gentleman sleuth who prefers to call himself a &apos;satyanneshi&apos;, has been a household favourite since being introduced by Sharadindu Bannerjee in the 1930&apos;s. As a result when it was announced that Uttam Kumar and Satyajit Ray, the greatest star and director in the history of Bengali cinema respectively would again join forces one year after the classic &apos;Nayak&apos; (1966) to bring one of the biggest Byomkesh-bestsellers &apos;Chiriyakhana&apos; onto the big-screen; expectations were bound to be sky-high. Were the expectations fulfilled? Depends on whether the viewer is a Byomkesh fan or not.\n\nIf one is a die-hard fan of the &apos;satyanneshi&apos;-stories and expects to see an equal reflection of the sleuth in Uttam Kumar; then there is a clear word of advice: STAY FAR AWAY! For it should be made clear at the beginning itself that barring the title of the story and names of the characters, the whole story and characterizations have been altered inside-out by the director, including Byomkesh and his accomplice Ajit. This Byomkesh is a complete Ray-product bearing no stamp of Sharadindu.\n\nLet us start from the beginning. A unique charm and specialty about Byomkesh has been the fact that he is married, is a father and is as worldly-minded like any common Bangalee; and yet he never allows that to be a hindrance to his profession. This makes his task more challenging than a Sherlock Holmes or a Feluda. But Ray models Byomkesh on his own creation Feluda and makes him a bachelor. Instead the forever-bachelor Ajit becomes a married man here. Another shock which the viewers are exposed to right at the start is Basuki, a snake which has been domesticated by the on-screen Byomkesh but would have been unimaginable for the literary Byomkesh who is a common family-man. So was the skeleton, hanging in his study. Whatever remaining expectations of any similarities are thoroughly crushed when our Bangalee &apos;satyanneshi&apos; proudly acknowledges his taste for everything and accepts a glass of whiskey from a colourful host! This trait was undoubtedly drawn by Ray from the Western spies and clearly established the fact that this Byomkesh is not a conventional Bangalee &apos;gentleman&apos;. Although we don&apos;t know much about the literary Byomkesh&apos;s taste for cinema; it was hilarious to see the &apos;Mahanayak&apos; expressing his abject disapproval for contemporary Bengali cinema, especially after &apos;Nayak&apos; a year back. Another interesting point is the camaraderie between Byomkesh and Ajit where they alternately address each other as both &apos;tumi&apos; and &apos;tui&apos;; while in the books it&apos;s always strictly &apos;tumi&apos; even after years of acquaintance.\n\nFor fans of the novel also it could be a huge disappointment. It&apos;s adequate to say, it would be much easier to mark the similarities, than to point out the differences! But if one is willing to ignore the novel, then one must applaud the director for weaving a totally different story from someone else&apos;s premise and characters and yet delivering quiet an engaging whodunit-thriller. It&apos;s still tough to understand the reason why anyone should tamper with a perfectly fine story, give it his own shape and still give its credit to the original writer! A viewer ignorant of the novel, would praise or criticise Sharadindu if he likes or dislikes the film-story; where else in reality it&apos;s Ray who should be held accountable for both.\n\nRay takes all liberties in molding his Byomkesh and soon the viewers also begin to enjoy the fun. Amidst the barrage of alterations, there is one sequence where the director must be patted on the back for wriggling out of a really dilemma-tic situation. In the novel, the main culprit passes on a cyanide ampule to his wife by engaging in a long lip-lock with her. It goes without saying such a sequence would have created a mass uproar back then; and yet Ray was not a director who would settle for a cheat-kiss. Hence, it was an indescribable relief when he steered clear of any such controversy and unearthed a climax which was wholly acceptable to a conservative family audience. A heart-felt thanks to the master for sparing me the blushes in front of my parents!\n\nAs for the performances, Uttam Kumar brought his heroic personality to the character just as Soumitra Chatterjee would go on to do for Feluda. Although he gave it a more serious touch sacrificing on the sense of humour of the literary avatar. It was amusing to see him in the get-up of a Japanese horticulturist Okakhora with the characteristic fleet- footed walk, besides portraying a Kabuliwala as well. The only odd point that strikes is Uttam&apos;s height, as Japanese are seldom so tall. Shailen Mukherjee as Ajit is good. He is quite funny when Byomkesh brings Basuki near him or when he asks Dr. Das fearfully if he had ever been to Japan. Chinmoy Roy was also quite funny in asking to take his photo or when he was doing a &apos;namashkar&apos; while holding a pup all along. Special mention must be made of Subrota Mukherjee during the interrogation scene which was hilarious. Jahar Ganguly and the inspector were the others who impressed.\n\nOverall, &apos;Chiriyakhana&apos; is Ray&apos;s best thriller beating the two Feluda- adventures, which were based on his own story. It might even have been better if he had made this film outside the brand-Byomkesh. The die-hard &apos;satyanneshi&apos; fans would surely agree.",

      "reviewBody": "Inside Job is an enthralling documentary about how the reckless actions of Wall Street lead to the near collapse of the financial sector and subsequently the deepest recession since the 1930s. This is the second film by director Charles Ferguson, the first being No End in Sight an equally engaging indictment of the Bush Administration&apos;s handling of the occupation of Iraq. \n\nFerguson focuses on the Wall Street culture and the blatant arrogance of a half dozen men as the main causes of the financial turmoil. Inside Job begins in Iceland where the deregulation of the financial system in the 1990s lead to three banks accumulating assets almost ten times the small country&apos;s gross domestic product.\n\nIt becomes clear by the midpoint of the film that Iceland is a micro example of what has become a global problem. Runaway banks have been accumulating assets through toxic loans and other manoeuvres while paying themselves lavish bonuses. \n\nInside Job is easily one of the most frustrating documentaries ever made. And that is undoubtedly Ferguson&apos;s intention. The film is critical of Wall Street executives, credit agencies and especially regulatory agencies for the crisis.\n\nInside Job includes interviews from IMF head Dominique Strauss-Khan, congressmen Barney Frank, former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and many others. Ferguson traces the evolution of the banks from a small, largely local service to an out of control industry. He does not hold back criticizing every administration since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.\n\nFerguson argues that despite what most people think, there were many people warning of an impending crisis in global financial markets. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Timothy Geithner ignored various signs of impending doom. Not to mention former treasury secretary and incidentally former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson.\n\nInside Job makes the argument that the federal regulators are as responsible for the breakdown of the system as are the executives of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. More frustrating still is the revolving door between Wall Street and government agencies.\n\nAs the banks became more deregulated, the more speculation became a problem. Derivatives, and credit default swaps, complicated trading schemes that most people do not understand is what caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers sending shockwaves through financial centres all over the world.\n\nCredit agencies like Moody&apos;s and Standard and Poor gave firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman brothers, and Morgan Stanley A grade credit ratings within weeks before they nearly collapsed. And also having one of their executives standing up in front of a congressional committee and telling congressmen that their ratings are just merely &apos;opinion&apos;.\n\nIt becomes clear that this is not a problem that emerged from the housing boom early in president George W. Bush&apos;s second term. Rather this was a systematic breakdown driven by a neoliberal ideology supported by Ivey league economic schools across the United States.\n\nInside Job is simply a story of bankers more interested in collecting bonuses and making more money than providing what should be an essential service. What makes it even more frustrating is that many of the key figures behind the crisis are currently on Barak Obama&apos;s staff. The film leaves us with a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nAs Ferguson notes, Wall Street has returned to normal with no federal prosecutions against any of the guilty. And one of the most poignant scenes in the film comes from Robert Gnaizda, the former head of the Greenlining Institute, a consumer lobbyist group who laughingly dismisses recent legislation to regulate banks with a simple &apos;Hah&apos;.\n\nInside Job helps explain many of the complex terms such as derivatives and insurance backed securities that confuse those not immersed in the banking community. It is essential viewing for any citizen concerned about our broken system.",

Not only does the film fail as a satisfying revenge flick, but it is also barely passes as a torture-porn style horror, with not nearly enough eye-watering graphic gore to satisfy the genre&apos;s bloodthirsty fans.\n\nWhere the film works best is as a cautionary tale, showing exactly what can happen if one allows a desire for revenge to become all-consuming; the film makes it abundantly clear that such a path can only lead to suffering for ALL involved. Sadly, although the film might possibly work as a deterrent for potential vengeful nerds, I doubt that bullies will get the message that picking on the weak is wrong: most of them are far too stupid to grasp that concept.",

It stars Isabelle Huppert, but she is so naturalistic you forget she&apos;s Isabelle Huppert.\n\nFor an altogether different, but equally pleasurable, although more theatrical, yet completely underrated take on the unnamed cataclysm bit, see\n\nA BOY AND HIS DOG.

Ravi is framed for crime and sentenced to twelve years in prison. Renuka promises she will take care of Rohan, and gives him to a friend (played by my favorite Mummy, Reema Lagoo) who adopts him, and renames him Vasu. When Ravi is released from prison, he seeks out Renuka, who has lost her memory and cannot tell him where Rohan/Vasu (Salman Khan) is now. In the meantime, Vasu grows up into a successful lawyer, falls in love with Payal (Karisma Kapoor), and dreams of being reunited with Ravi. Unfortunately, Vasu has made an important enemy, and his future happiness, if not his life, is at stake.\n\nThe best part of this melodrama is the light romance between Vasu and Payal. The main plot, which should be moving, is convoluted at times, and the acting not convincing. Even Karisma Kapoor does not display the enthusiasm and energy of her later movies. The songs are average, and the choreography unremarkable. Reema Lagoo&apos;s beauty and elegance shine through, but otherwise this is a mediocre movie that does well enough for a time-pass, but is not memorable in the long run.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is wonderfully topical. Eichmann is riveting in his ordinariness. He repeats over and over his conviction that he obeyed orders, and he prides himself that his superiors had nothing to complain about in the efficiency with which performed his duties. He also says it would have been futile to resist. He might easily have held an MBA from one of our finest business schools today, or a law degree from one of our foremost law schools. One goes along to get a along. What adds to his topicality is that today the American government is proceeding against Erik Snowden and Bradley Manning on what it seems to take as the self-evident principle one should always obey orders--especially if one is in the armed services or is an employee of the government. Eichmann does not lose his temper and is not irrational. On the contrary, he is wonderfully consistent. He functions therefore as a kind of terrible wake-up call indicating what one can come to if one will go all the way with the notion that orders from superiors relieve one from moral responsibility.",

Also the movie simply looks great - shot mostly on day light and in Israely woods - also a nice twist on the genre (the daylight). I also very much enjoyed the girls in the short tennis skirts running all over - nice touch.... well done on doing the first slasher in Israel, and a damn good one.",

      "reviewBody": "A remarkably potent little film about a couple of very proper English kids who get lost in the Australian outback and hitch up with an aborigine boy on his initiation quest (or &quot;walkabout&quot;).  My mom took me to see it when I was ten, and I&apos;ve been haunted by it ever since.  With some understated yet disturbing themes of alienation and violence, as well as the first scenes of full nudity I had ever witnessed on screen, I&apos;ve sometimes wondered whether mom knew what she was getting into when she took me along.  According to the trailer in the letterbox edition, Parents&apos; Magazine recommended the film &quot;without reservation&quot; for young and old alike, because it depicts &quot;facts of life.&quot;  While that may be true, times have changed, and I can&apos;t imagine anyone today describing this subtle and unsettling story as &quot;family fare.&quot; Incredibly tame, on its face, by today&apos;s standards of sensory overload, its essential world-weariness and maturity is no longer a didactic priority in our age of overconfidence.  Watching it recently, I was on guard for signs of the myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot;--the hackneyed, simplistic, and generally hypocritical pretension that pre-industrial and non-Western peoples are morally superior to decadent moderns, which is demeaning to both modern and &quot;savage&quot; alike.  There are instances of it here--most notably when a couple of rifle-toting, four-wheeling hunters decimate the landscape--but the overall emphasis is on the parallels between aborigine and Western life. Even scenes of the transience and decay of modern civilization are mirrored by the life-and-death cycles of the wilderness.  With so many underlying similarities, the real question is why the teenaged English girl cannot embrace, figuratively and literally, the young black man who has saved her life and provided so selflessly for her, even while her younger brother, in all his innocence, has never doubted that they are a family.  Is it race? Culture?  Or does it reach to more fundamental questions of boy and girl, man and woman, human and human?  This film has held up remarkably well over the past 30 years, and is well worth a look."

I tremble at the thought of going through that sort of experience again. The plot was terrible, the scenery was infantile in that too much green, supposedly NV goggles? was used and it was repetitive. The editor should not have used the same scenes so often. It became boring. Disjointed is another word that springs to mind. Anyone on amphetamines would probably feel at home. One reviewer said the downside was that it was a low-cost movie. Well, I cannot agree. Nobody in his/her right mind would spend money on this waste of time so that is not really a consideration. My only positive suggestion is that it would have been better named by calling it EXCRETA not EJECTA.",

Lee pulls out all the cinematic weapons in his arsenal in this humorous, almost deconstructionist romp through Hong Kong action cinema, film noir, comic books, and more. There are more homages, visual tricks, and musical gags than in almost any film I&apos;ve seen. And that&apos;s a good thing because plot wise this is very generic. Some people are sure to decry the supposed glorification of police brutality. An alternate interpretation that is criticizing the police by showing their basic similarity to the bad guys is too facile to be taken seriously. But despite any possible qualms one might have with any messages being delivered, this film is just plain too fun and funny to not like.",

      "reviewBody": "The night of August 10th, when the feast of St. Lawrence is observed, is the time of the year when meteor showers can be observed in the sky. It has been a tradition in the western culture that wishing for a favor when watching the falling stars in the sky is a way to ask for love, riches and luck. The sky watchers can expect a spectacle like no other because of the way those distant lights are seen falling, fast and furious.\n\nThe brothers Taviani, Paolo and Vittorio, have always come out with interesting films that involve simple people, usually connected to the land. In &quot;La Notte di San Lorenzo&quot;, the Tavianis take the viewer to witness a group of people from Tuscany during the last days of WWII. The story is told by a 6 years old girl who was too young to realize the horrors around her in those final days of the conflict.\n\nIn spite of the approaching American liberating army, there are still the horrible local Fascists, who knowing they were fighting a losing battle, terrorized their neighbors into submission. These misguided people, having mined most of the houses in the town, are feared by the local population. Some flee into the countryside, but some remain in the town, convinced that being in the big church will protect them against evil.\n\nThings go from bad to worse. We see different vignettes involving some of the people, as they cope with the situation. There is Galvano, who has loved Concetta in silence and is finally, as in a miracle, gets his wish granted in the way that she acknowledges that she has always love him, even after both have been married to different people. There&apos;s the young pregnant young bride, who is expecting and who gets married at the beginning of the film, only to be separated from her husband in an ironic twist.\n\nThe Tavianis painted a huge canvas in which they situated the action. Tuscany in the summer is a lovely place to be, but one can&apos;t even comprehend that it was also the scene for the tragedy lived in Italy in those tragic years. The music by Nicola Piovani is effective in the background. Franco DiGiacomo&apos;s photography does wonders to make the film a great experience. The large cast does an excellent job for the Tavianis, who are ultimately, the ones to thank for their courage in presenting us this lyrical movie of beauty and death.",

Of course it&apos;s gets side tracked quite a bit here and there and that&apos;s where this movie loses its steam. It&apos;s a shame because the story is really good here. And the performances keep you watching for sure but then Brienen has to get all &quot;Brienen&quot;. Look you&apos;ll get what I&apos;m saying if you seen this directors other movies. A little too artsy, and self indulgent. If would have just stuck to the main story it would be a solid 8/10 but since it deviates 6/10.",

Their movies are still funnier than a great amount, of &apos;comedy&apos; dross that the film industry still try and palm us off with. As a Brit I have to say that the absolute worst culprits, are the American film companies.\n\nFox wanted &apos;commercial $ makers and their 21st century compatriots, are still up to the same fiscal shenanigans.\n\nThere is nothing new in either the film nor TV industries, profit motives before quality every time.\n\nBut with Laurel and Hardy their comedic quality will always shine through, and frankly continues to transcend time itself.",

      "reviewBody": "I speculate that King Hu must have left Shaw Brothers with a bad taste in his mouth after doing &quot;Come Drink With Me&quot;. &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; is also one of the greatest martial arts movies despite having room for improvement. This movie feels to me like King Hu made those improvements in it. I consider this his is his masterpiece. I compare it to the movies of Akira Kurosawa. Too bad that King Hu was nowhere near as prolific. This movie could even be considered his one hit wonder.\n\nKing Hu seemed to realize the claustrophobic situation of of the good guys and bad guys face to face in the Dragon Inn was great drama but it had to be contrasted with as much wide open space as possible. In &quot;Dragon Inn&quot; most scenes outside the inn are shot in expansive panoramas. Like Kurosawa, King Hu appreciated the way moving the camera brought the audience into the scene. He used tracking shots, particularly during fight sequences, to get this feeling.\n\nHang Ying-Chieh gets credit as action coordinator. He was the Big Boss in Bruce Lee&apos;s &quot;The Big Boss&quot;. Remember when Bruce is cut, wipes off his blood then tastes it? Hang Ying-Chieh does the same here. The sword fights are Japanese style - starting with a suspenseful face off, then a sudden attack to cover the distance, just a few quick strokes of action, then stop and wait a few seconds to feel the results. A real sword cut is initially almost painless so the person cut doesn&apos;t know until he sees the effect of the cut.\n\nI rate this as one of the best of 1967 and I recommend it to everyone - not just fans of the genre - to everyone.",

The story itself is so famous that I won&apos;t bother with summarizing it and I highly recommend that the eight or so people who don&apos;t know it watch this film (if you can&apos;t find a copy, it&apos;s on YouTube). While there have been animated versions before and musical versions before, this is the only version I know of that is an animated musical (if you know of any other such versions, let me know), and I think it does both of these aspects very well, especially since I had an extremely hard time getting Santa&apos;s Sooty Suit out of my brain. Likewise with the animation, which is crisp and bright without being too bright. This movie sticks pretty close to the original and the few changes it does make actually work, such as Scrooge having an equally grouchy dog and Tiny Tim accompanying his father to work. The ghosts are very good as well, especially the ghost of Christmas Future, who reminds me somewhat of the Grim Reaper. The duet between a young Scrooge and Belle is very touching and bittersweet.",

      "reviewBody": "I guess topics which are taboo, or films that have their bans lifted, will more than likely have its audience base automatically built from the curiosity arising from its background, wondering on what grounds and rationale that such a film got made or banned in the first place. The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo had its fair share of publicity coming from ex Japanese prime minister Koizumi&apos;s high profile visits to the shrine for worship, much to the disgust of neighbours China and Korea, because enshrined within those grounds, are some of the tried war criminals of WWII, whom to most in Asia, are not deemed to be martyrs, having started a campaign on aggression in the region.\n\nDepending on which camp you&apos;re standing in, there are two sides of the coin even from within a homogeneous society like Japan itself  those who find it no big deal for their prime minister to visit the shrine at his own personal capacity, and those who find it wrong to do so. On a macro level, while it is easy to condemn those who partook in the war, from personal stories just like that in any society, there will always be those who have to do it against their will, and even some touching stories coming from the surviving siblings that their brothers get sent away, being quite clear that they&apos;ll never come back ever again.\n\nAs a documentary, there is no lack of an educational value in it. There were plenty of nuggets of information for the military history buffs, and some of the things I learnt, was how Yasukuni itself has so much importance and relevance to Imperial Japan. For starters, I learnt that swords have an indelible connection to the army and to the shrine, given that sword forgers from the shrine made their swords on those very grounds, and officers at the frontline are bestowed one each. This equates to quality swords running in the thousands being made. Of course, these swords are infamous for being tools used to behead countless of victims, and some of these atrocities get publicized as bravery contests amongst officers.\n\nAnd the significance of the sword is so important, that within the shrine, the object of worship is none other than one Yasukuni sword which is used to represent the more than 2 million souls who were lost in the war, fighting for the Emperor, which of course amongst that figure, things are not all that clear, with various groups lobbying for things such as removal of names and enshrining of their ancestors, because they were either forced to conscript, or some aren&apos;t even Japanese to begin with. It&apos;s hard to imagine  2 millions souls  captured into one single sword, and if this was a martial arts world we live in, that would be one heck of a powerful sword.\n\nBut as a movie, there were a lot more to be desired. Granted when dealing with topics of controversy, answers during interviews are not bound to be forthcoming, given the director&apos;s attempt to elicit some candid remarks from the sole remaining Yasukuni sword forger who&apos;s already into his 90s. Interviews with his subjects also seem to be more from the man on the street, and thus dilutes some of the expected quality in the answers, which some might allude to talk that you&apos;ll hear from coffeeshops, some of which might be entertaining for its point blank accusations, such as the British National Museum being a storage space for goods plundered all over the world. I chuckled at this comment because this is not the first time I&apos;m hearing it, as I&apos;ve heard it before from a Brit on a tour telling all tourists that same thing as well (he&apos;s a tour guide by the way).\n\nMost of the time, the camera lingers in and around the grounds of the shrine on August 15, since it&apos;s the day designated as a remembrance, and you have various military groups coming on site to pay their respects, as will other civil groups and protesters as well, thus making it fertile grounds for opposing members of the groups to come into blows, verbally or physically, in trying to force their viewpoints on the other. One thing&apos;s for sure though, that groups are passionate in their beliefs, and no words get minced in their shout-outs.\n\nHowever, the film doesn&apos;t go beyond what&apos;s shown on the surface. It seems quite contented in capturing events of the day, like a newsreel, but without any further input on how and why such events, shots and the inclusion of such scenes mattered. There was an extended scene involving an American who was flag waving (the stars and stripes) on the grounds to mixed reactions from the Japanese people, as well as dwelling on incidents such as the Taiwanese indigenous groups wanting to reclaim the souls of their ancestors. But alas further interviews to pick the minds of these folks were not done  maybe the request to interview them was unsuccessful?\n\nSo while it had some ingredients to make it more than worthwhile to sit through 2 hours of a film revolving around the Yasukuni shrine and movement, its presentation could have been a lot stronger. The narrative got quite messy and all over the place, never having a primary focus, but flitted around as and when it found convenience. I felt the ending was rather week because of its reliance on commonly seen archival stock images and videos, but on the whole, an impressive effort and courage to explore something controversial and touchy even until today.",

      "reviewBody": "Girlfriend is a dark film, a very heavy film, weighing down on you as you watch it. There is so much going on beneath the surface of the artfully simplistic filming techniques. The viewer is forced to pay close attention to the cues within a wide shot, the secrets behind a dialogue, and the tragedies behind a profile.\n\nThe core cast is small, and we get to know each character in depth. To me, this adds to the small town feel provided by the setting of Girlfriend, Wayland, Massachusetts.\n\nEvan is a kind and pure heart, and everything from the way he is filmed to the lines he says presents him as such. We simply see him, in his small world, reaching out to and caring about the people around him. This is exemplified when he decides to give a large sum of money to the woman he has crushed on since high school, Candy.\n\nCandy has a difficult time believing that Evan&apos;s gift is from the kindness of his heart and not a means to an end. It is here that we get a glimpse into what her life has been like. Her past experiences and relationships have left her jaded. She&apos;s lost, held together only by her love for her son.\n\nRuss took me by surprise at how vile he was, even being prepared by the synopsis and the movie trailer. He is Candy&apos;s ex-boyfriend; violent, alcoholic, and just as lost as she. He still involves himself in her life, as does she with his, and the interaction is never healthy.\n\nKenny is a key pressure point in the story, helping to create conflict in an already volatile situation. His presence on screen is brief, but his impact on the story remains throughout.\n\nDuring a question and answer bit after the second showing at the Toronto International Film Festival, someone asked the cast and crew about the filming techniques used in the film. I found the cinematographer&apos;s response to be very intriguing. She explained that each main character was filmed in a unique way that exaggerates the nature of their situation and personality.\n\nEvan was filmed in wide, steady angles, so that we could see him in the middle of his world. Long takes allow the viewer to experience the passing of time in his overwhelmingly lonely reality.\n\nCandy was always filmed lost in a tight frame, between other people or objects, to demonstrate how suffocated her character was. This certainly came across to me, often times feeling stifled just watching it.\n\nRuss is a dark and mysterious character, and the camera got this across by shooting him from a distance and obstructing the view. Russ is always lurking in the back of your mind from the moment you meet him. My first time seeing the film, I was often left with a knot in my stomach after his scenes, just from the feeling of dread that his persona left with me.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that the cast chosen for this movie was beyond perfect. My congratulations go out to the production team for putting together such a successful band of talent. Evan Sneider is without a doubt the star, and his portrayal of everything from kindness, innocence, longing, hurt, and anger left me breathless. He masterfully delivered some of the most impacting lines in the film.\n\nShannon Woodward seems to be worn beyond her years as Candy. She presents the character as so lost and hopeless, tired of life in general, with little to cling to. There was a moment of having to return my mind to reality after the film when I had the pleasure of meeting Shannon, sweet and vibrant and humble.\n\nJackson Rathbone as Russ was absolutely haunting. From the moment you meet his character in the movie, the hair on the back of your neck stands up and you just know he&apos;s nothing but trouble. All through the film he demonstrates time and time again that he is in a dark, dark place. It is a testament to Jackson&apos;s talent as an actor that there are moments when you find yourself hurting for Russ, and you feel conflicted about it. Jackson&apos;s mastery of Russ&apos; facial expressions was what impressed me the most. In any scene, you can see and hear what Russ is putting out there, but see another emotion cross his face; doubt, revulsion with himself, shame, hurt. It is in these moments that you see the man behind the hard exterior, the man that knows when he is doing wrong, the man that feels emotions like anyone else.\n\nSo much went into making this film as beautiful as it was, and my review wouldn&apos;t be complete without mentioning the original score and soundtrack. The score was composed by the band 100 Monkeys, whose members include Jerad Anderson and Jackson Rathbone (both Girlfriend actors and producers,) M. Lawrence Abrams, Ben Johnson, and Ben Graupner. Its sound is raw and often times dark, much like the story, with subtle drones and dramatic crescendos that aided the suspense and anticipation prevalent throughout the movie. The soundtrack features well placed songs by talents such as Daniel Johnston and Spencer Bell. It is clear that everything, from the cast, the camera angles, the dialogue and the music, was chosen with the utmost care and attention, and was, to me, a total success.\n\nI came away from the movie feeling that it was a very bold and very important film. It touches on so many themes; prejudice, necessity, humanity, abuse, love. Seeing it twice wasn&apos;t enough, and I feel such a strong desire for everyone in the world to get to see it now.\n\nI congratulate everyone involved on an amazing and touching film. It has important statements to make, and I know that it will continue to make them as it wins the hearts of everyone that sees it."

Instead of bad acid flashbacks, they start losing their hair and deteriorate into erratic, sweaty, screaming, zombie-like killers that hate loud sounds.\n\nAmbitious low-budgeter has decent performances, a few good shocks and an interesting plot to offset some dated aspects to the story (like an unintentionally funny attack at a disco) and a seemingly incomplete ending (that seems to suggest this is based on an actual case!). Political satire remains relevant today and when one of the affected lurks around a mall at the end, DAWN OF THE DEAD (which was made later) will instantly come to mind.\n\nStar Zalman King, also in GALAXY OF TERROR (1981), went on to direct and produce a record number of 90s erotic movies and TV series (RED SHOE DIARIES). The director also made SQURIM, JUST BEFORE DAWN and REMOTE CONTROL, all above average low-budgeters.\n\nScore: 6 out of 10",

Carl Reiner&apos;s direction is substantial as he never tries to make the film more than it is.  Mark Harmon does some of the best work of his ho-hum career as a high school physical education instructor who must teach a group of lazy students who all have more personality than brains.  Kirstie Alley stars as the next-door teacher who teaches Harmon a few things about education.  All of the students have their moments as well.  However, it is Dean Cameron as &quot;Chainsaw&quot; who steals every scene and makes the film fun throughout.  A strange over-achiever.  3.5 out of 5 stars."

Its because the guy sounds dumber than I think his films will be.\n\nIts a common phenomenon, I think. Great filmmakers typically say less than enlightening things. Partly, I think it is because they are asked such trivial questions. Also that they have to &quot;explain&quot; themselves so they invent simpleminded stories for general consumption. Perhaps they even believe them. \n\nBut usually, these folks aren&apos;t very articulate verbally. I think that is why they are driven to cinema. Films that change lives can only come from someone fully in the thing, and that comes from urges. There&apos;s talent and insight in the mix of course, but its the urge that matters here. The less possible it is for an artist to convey something in words, the more he or she is driven, obsessed, with revealing it in another media.\n\nSo I expect these interview things to be relatively useless except for perhaps historical reasons. But this one is worse than usual because of the guy&apos;s theatrical background. He&apos;s created a persona and some trivial catchphrases. He&apos;s fully internalized them, and in the end he convinces me that he cannot do anything meaningful.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "name": "Reflects significant social change in Japan",
      "reviewBody": "Mikio Naruse&apos;s film Yearning reflects the significant social change occurring in Japan in 1964 when supermarkets began to offer cheaper prices in order to drive out the small shops which had dominated the market. This changing structure particularly affects Reiko (Hideko Takamine), a widow since the last war after only being married for six months. She has remained with her husband&apos;s family to run the family grocery store along with her mother-in-law Shizu (Aiko Mamasu) while brother-in-law Koji (Yûzô Kayama), and sister-in-laws Hisako (Mitsuko Kusabue) and Takako (Yumi Shirakawa) live their own private lives. Takamine&apos;s remarkable performance as the repressed widow conveys a longing for a freedom that has been elusive.\n\nThe film opens as a van parades the streets advertising the supermarket, driving past Reiko&apos;s store in the process. Shot in Naruse&apos;s quiet style, the film is a study in contrasts. Reiko is a woman with traditional values who has repressed her own desire for companionship to serve her husband&apos;s family, while Koji is a layabout who drinks and gambles and takes no responsibility for the family business. When a group of drunken businessman pressure bar girls to see how many eggs they can stuff into their mouths, Koji intervenes and starts a fight leaving Reiko to bail him out of jail. Koji and his sisters make plans to build their own supermarket, but conspicuously leave Reiko out of their plans, urging her to remarry.\n\nReiko is hurt by the family&apos;s seeming lack of appreciation for her service. She is accepting of her role, but emotionally unprepared when Koji surprisingly confesses to her that he loves her. Though Reiko initially rejects his advances, she tells him later: &quot;when you said you loved me, I felt glad,&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve been a different woman since that day.&quot; She is unable, however, to accept Koji&apos;s telling her that she has wasted her life for his family. Though she hears the words, she is too bound to the past to be able to acknowledge their truth. She tells Koji, &quot;I didn&apos;t waste my life. I lived it,&quot; but she is not convincing. The entire mood of the film changes with Koji&apos;s declaration and the way their relationship unfolds constitutes the emotional core of the film and provides its most dramatic moments and its shattering conclusion.",

      "reviewBody": "With a mix of modern dresses for the ladies and typical regimental outfits for the men, this adaptation of ANNA KARENINA is quite different from the novel and other film versions in a few ways.  After deserting her family for Vronsky, he does not tire of and desert her - he stays faithful - it is she who voluntarily gives him up to prevent his being thrown out of the Guards and thereby saves his name from disgrace - her suicide is to save him, rather than being an act of despair.\n\nAnna&apos;s completely &quot;losing it&quot; when his horse falls in a race - in front of society - is her downfall as it exposes their affair to the world, after which society must wreak its revenge.  Without this &quot;flaw,&quot; things might have gone otherwise for her.   \n\nThe finest scenes are between Garbo and Philippe de Lacy, who plays her son. Their two scenes are so full of playful mother-son love as to prove to better than Garbo&apos;s scenes with Gilbert. Indeed, there is none of the passion or obsession here that the two displayed earlier that year in FLESH AND THE DEVIL.  de Lacy is a beautiful young actor and a &quot;natural.&quot;  One of the annoying things about Vronsky is his inability to understand this love - he selfishly wants Anna all to himself - the cad!\n\nGarbo&apos;s farewell scene with Gilbert, she knowing she&apos;ll never see him again and he oblivious to this fact, is also quite well done.\n\nThe TCM print is flawed by having a live audience reacting poorly on the soundtrack, although the newly commissioned score by Arnold Brostoff is quite fine.  This soundtrack addition occurred in 1994 and seems the only one accompanying prints of the film currently.  \n\nThere is a beautifully photographed waltz with Garbo and Gilbert - oft seen in compilations and reminiscent of his waltz scenes with Mae Murray in THE MERRY WIDOW.\n\nAll in all, worth catching for Garbo, but the two later remakes of the work are much better."

Somehow, Beethoven is still with the brand new Newtons, I guess George, Alice, and their kids were looking for some kind of good excuse to get rid of Beethoven.\n\nBasically, Beth and Richard want to get rid of Beethoven due to poor habits of drooling and destroying, but the kids want to keep him so they secretly take Beethoven to obedience classes. But Richard finds out that Beethoven inspires him to create his best art pieces ever. There is another family who is more wealthy and also have a St. Bernard, Michaelangelo, and kidnappers want him so they can get a ransom, not that much money if you ask me, but Beethoven and Michaelanglo get mixed up when they&apos;re both outside and end up with the wrong families.\n\nBeethoven&apos;s 4th is a pretty sorry excuse for a film, but it was a little better than the third Beethoven movie. My cousins really enjoy these films, so like I said before, these films must be doing something right. For a family film, it wouldn&apos;t be too bad, but for me, this was a pretty silly movie.\n\n3/10",

      "reviewBody": "Having read several books about Anne Frank and seeing the wonderful documentary, ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED, I was very curious about this film.  I could not have been more impressed.  The casting was excellent,  and the acting superb, especially with Hannah Taylor-Gordon as Anne and the riveting presence of Ben Kingsley as Otto.  Yes, it was difficult to watch and yes, it was not &quot;entertaining&quot; by definition.  But if you want a very accurate portrayal of the before, during and after events of the group who inhabited the &quot;secret annexe,&quot; you won&apos;t do better than this film.  I&apos;m sure it will be a treasure for years to come.  Beware:  Although it is an excellent educational tool, the last 45 minutes are quite intense and do include some brief nudity.  Small children may find it too graphic.",

      "reviewBody": "The film is distinctive in four ways, the first being that Steve McQueen finally returned to the screen after having spent the 1970s elsewhere. He was a bounty hunter in the late 1950s on television, then jumped to prominence in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; about 1960 and spent the next ten years as a dominant force on-screen. So this film was a &quot;comeback.&quot; But McQueen came back as an artist, not as a cartoon version of his earlier self. His portrayal of Tom Horn does not use close-ups, quick draws or choreographed violence. The second thing that stands out here is the subject of the film, which is frontier justice on the high plains, a rough subject to be sure. &quot;Tom Horn&quot; (1980) is the first movie since &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) to deal realistically with the subject a part of which treatment is using the countryside itself as a character. There were a lot of movies beginning in the late 1960s with Clint Eastwood&apos;s &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot; which focused on the grisly righteousness of law enforcement, but it wasn&apos;t until Eastwood&apos;s &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1998) that he finally made a movie that approached the quality of &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;Tom Horn,&quot; and employed some panoramic camera work. Third, the way the story is told is unfamiliar to most modern movie fans because it is so old, traditional and specific to the northern plains. The story is told, by veteran Western director Wiard, in the same way author Albert White Eagle tells stories, as a montage of contrasting fragments often out of chrnonolgical order -- &quot;oh, by the way, I forget to tell you something, let me tack it on now&quot; -- the juxtaposition of which fragments imply the surreal ambience of the times, an ambience which could not be effectively shown using the usual plot devices, cinematic close-ups, narrative summaries and chronological markers. For example, we see Tom in a jail cell looking at the clouds outside the little window, then we see him, with the same clouds in the sky behind him, shooting a young man (uncredited actor Sonny Skyhawk) who tries to kill the school marm as she bathes in the horse trough while talking with Tom. Is this something that really happened before he was locked up, or is it a fantasy or dream born of incarceration? It doesn&apos;t matter whether the scene is real or imagined, what matters is the jolt we receive by seeing it out of sequence. Most directors would have either shown Tom going to sleep in the cell, thus implying the scene was a dream, or would have had some narrative dialogue which indicated that Tom was remembering something that had really transpired. But Wiard, throughout the film, uses that northern technique. Another example is when we are visually escorted out of a scene in which Tom kills a rustler, with beautiful mountains in the background, into one where he is breaking a horse for the schoolmarm to eventually ride -- the same mountains are in the background, unchanged. A final thing about this movie was actor Richard Farnsworth. This was the first movie in which he had considerable dialogue, and was given a chance to demonstrate his skill at characterization. He plays John Coble, Tom Horn&apos;s employer. At the end of the movie is a 1904 quote from Coble, saying that that Tom was not guilty of the crime of which he was accused and convicted. This quotation, as Western researchers know, is from Coble&apos;s suicide note. And it foreshadowed Farnsworth&apos;s sucide twenty-two years later, a few months after being nominated, finally, for an Academy Award for his brilliant portrayal in &quot;The Straight Story.&quot; McQueen, on-screen, and Farnsworth, on-screen and off, epitomized that quality of the Westerner least understood by people in the rest of the nation. The real Tom Horn said,  &quot;The people in the Northeast hire us to protect them from the people in the South,&quot; and, &quot;We find the thing, whatever it is, then somebody else gets the glory for bringing it down, and somebody else makes the money for taking it back to the folks in town,&quot; but &quot;You can either laugh or cry at your fate, and that&apos;s not much of a choice, is it, pardner?&quot; The droll stocism and sardonic wit of the cowboy, and the western tracker whether white or Indian, has always enchanted and mystified the rest of the nation, and never really been understood. The movie, &quot;Tom Horn,&quot; is a fitting tribute to the history and people of the northern plains, to Steve McQueen&apos;s artistry, to the memory of Richard Farnsworth, and to stories that are not easy to tell.\n\n w. t. benda"

      "reviewBody": "Scrap Wood War is about two friends, Ziggy and Bas, finishing Elementary school who due to circumstances causing personal disappointment and jealousy find their friendship tested. As an educator who works with children, I found the plot and sequence of events very believable. The acting was average to above average. I appreciated the way the boys and their friendship was portrayed. Sensitive, but not mushy. I am sure there are many elementary children who will identify with the story plot - friends allowing emotions and the difficulties of growing up, with all its coming changes, to get in the way of a friendship. So too will children relate to the vacillating feelings of the two friends who find themselves wanting to restore the friendship but not sure how, then getting angry with each other all over again. There is by my count 3 swears in the English subtitles and two brief, mild sexual innuendos. But overall, expect this to be one of those movies where you can sit right next to your child and never blush. I recommend the movie and would even highly recommend it if you have a son who is struggling with a friendship and lacks the emotional vocabulary to discuss it with you. Watch the movie together and use it to open discussion. Or, just watch and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "If there were an award for sheer single-mindedness, this film would win a lifetime- achievement. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen a movie more dedicated to following through on its premise. With near excruciating detail, the two and a-half hour narrative follows out a plot to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle by disgruntled Algerian colonialists who hire a professional hit man known as the Jackal.\n\nNow you might think 140-minutes would provide plenty of critical material to write about. But, in my little book, the sum-total doesn&apos;t. Instead, the screenplay consists entirely of following out the tactics of police pursuit and criminal evasion, producing results that are, nevertheless, riveting as heck. That&apos;s mainly because the screenplay shows the Jackal&apos;s painstaking preparation, though much is done in silence such that we don&apos;t know why he&apos;s doing what he&apos;s doing. We find out, however, as the chase unfolds and he puts those preparations into practice, allowing him to stay one-step ahead of the police pursuers. It amounts to an exquisite game of cat and mouse, and is about as well played as any thriller I&apos;ve seen. But you have to stay alert since the Jackal operates mainly in silence.\n\nIf there&apos;s a downside, it&apos;s probably some seemingly pointless interludes where police functionaries walk along corridors to somewhere. I&apos;m guessing these were included to give us a taste of the richly ornate interiors of high government offices since the walking itself doesn&apos;t advance the single-minded plot. Still, these scenes, along with the many sunny outdoor shots, do lend an eye-catching background to all the maneuvering.\n\nAnyway, between the expert screenplay, fine acting, and colorful European locales, the movie is richly deserving of its first-rate reputation."

Reminds me of the old David Niven movies, except much less restrained.\n\nBut I also want to point out that the movie ends with a quote: &quot;Every person is entitled to the respect of his or her private life. Penal Code, Article 9.&quot; Indeed, the wry tongue in cheek is pointed squarely at the absurdities of the French intelligence community. I find looking at the movie in that light adds another bit of fun to identifying the &quot;good guys&quot; and the bad guys.\n\nWell worth your time.",

Imaginative veteran Nathan Juran directs very accurately and imaginatively, and the acting by George Macready as the ambitious villain, aided by Gene Evans (not quite up to a classical accent) and Kathleen Hughes and that of their opponents played by Edgar Barrier, the crafty Stephen Geray and others is above average for any genre. Adding to the fun is lovely Laurie impersonating a boy, a mysterious magic sword (which in lesser hands would have been a detriment) and its magical unwillingness to obey other than a virtuous owner. There is a prolonged sequence when various magicians attempt to remove the sword--which Macready needs to claim the throne--that has become embedded in a wall, and more physically colorful and beautifully-realized scenes than in any ten mean-streets melodramas of the post 1970s. If you do not fall in love with the spirited Khairozan, as Hudson does in the film, then you are probably dead. If you cannot delight in this youthful and stirring adventure of a bygone era, you had best give Grecianized Near-Easterns, our richest adventure genre in so many ways, a consistent miss.",

But it remains without a doubt one of the most enjoyable and pleasurable comedies ever made. It features graceful dynamism and vibrancy that are rare in the Ford oeuvre. It is also one of his fastest movies. It contains what it is probably one of the finest Edward G. Robinson performances I have seen. He is outstanding in the dual role of a mild, working class office clerk Arthur Ferguson Jones who is mistaken for a ruthless mobster Mannion (the role he perfected in &quot;Little Caesar&quot;). And then there is the lovely Jean Arthur as Robinson&apos;s coolly self-reliant co-worker, who starts by pitying him and then encourages him, and ultimately falls in love with him. She and Robinson are superb together. It is nowhere near her splendid presence in Mitchell Leisen&apos;s &quot;Easy Living&quot; and Frank Borzage&apos;s &quot;History Is Made at Night&quot;, but this was the sort of role Arthur was to make of her own. \n\nA must-see!"

So I advice you to go to the movie theaters as a family and your 4-12 years old go watch this film and you and our spouse or partner watch a more grown up film like Inception or if you have already seen Inception, then go watch Salt. However this isn&apos;t the worst film ever, or the worst film of Summer 2010, there are actually some funny and enjoyable moments in this film, however there aren&apos;t many of them at all. If it was consistently funny, I&apos;d recommend it to the whole family or anyone looking for a good time.\n\nThis film is actually better than Marmaduke, but its still very dull and really not funny. It won&apos;t be a horrible experience watching this film, but it will be boring.\n\n4/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bankers of God: The Calvi Affair&quot; is a straightforward, very dialogue-heavy but fairly interesting attempt by co-screenwriter and director Giuseppe Ferrara to recreate the events of 1982 in Italy, when a very prominent banker, Roberto Calvi, got mixed up with elements as diverse as the Italian Secret Service, the mafia, and even the Vatican. A debt of over a billion dollars to the Banco Ambrosiano is discovered, and it serves as the catalyst to various high-stakes maneuvering by Calvi and others to solve their problems.\n\nEven if you&apos;re like this viewer, and some of the details and story threads may fly over your head, Ferrara and company do a capable job of storytelling in this long but very well acted crime drama. It seems unthinkable that all of these separate entities could have been connected in some way to the goings-on. The film also uses political backdrops such as the attempted assassination of The Pope, and the Falklands War, as it all figures into this twisty plot.\n\nAll of it does have the potential to confuse the viewer, but the actors are all compelling to watch. Omero Antonutti is excellent as Calvi, a sympathetic man who is made to sweat bullets at times. Pamela Villoresi is impassioned as his worried wife. The big names in the cast are Giancarlo Giannini as the colourful Flavio Carboni and Rutger Hauer (it does take some getting used to, hearing him dubbed into Italian) as a sly Cardinal.\n\nWonderfully scored by Pino Donaggio, this does go on for quite a bit, clocking in at two hours and eight minutes, but with the knowledge that the whole story is shrouded in some mystery, some definite weight is added to the saga.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Of course instead of turning himself over to the authorities, Paul tries to get rid of the body and clear his hands of the suspected murder. As one would have guessed, it&apos;s not easy getting rid of a body. Especially under the eyes of nosy neighbors, intruding mothers and somehow eerie unknowns.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie, although not James Cameron&apos;s best, is visually exciting and suspenseful. A gripping expedition becomes a race against time and human nature, when a group of explorers navigating an immense cave in Papua New Guinea during a cyclone find themselves trapped in what threatens to become a watery tomb. \n\nThe sometimes melodramatic acting and clichéd dialogue tries too hard to construct the nature of each character before the action scenes start to set in, the uncompromising and experienced leader, the rash and cocky business man, the young kid with father issues. There were plenty of chances to let these traits become apparent naturally throughout the script.\n\nThe acting gets more bearable as the number of characters starts to dwindle a little. What saves this movie is the sense of scale in the scenery, the beauty of the natural caves, and the realism with which situations become volatile and unmanageable. \n\nOverall, if you want to see a decent, action driven film about of one of the world&apos;s last remaining unexplored landforms, then Sanctum will (probably) not disappoint. It could have done without the 3D, which seemed unnecessary overkill. Not as good as The Abyss, but a similarly excellent visual experience to Avatar, unfortunately it comes with a similar level of acting and, with momentary exceptions, emotional depth.",

Not only is the acting terrible, but the plot is never even close to developed. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore. I&apos;ve never read the book, so I can&apos;t critique on that, but this is the first review that I&apos;ve written here and it&apos;s purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life. I can&apos;t remember the last time I couldn&apos;t even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.",

I mean, accidental marriage in Vegas? Ashton Kutcher AND Cameron Diaz? Like, together? It was a bit scary.\n\nHowever, after watching it I realized I&apos;d had a lot of fun through the movie. It&apos;s only and hour and a half, so it&apos;s not going to stretch on forever. Kutcher and Diaz provided enough funny moments to make the movie fairly amusing, but what really surprised me was their chemistry. Maybe it was because I was so negative about it before, but they went together well. There were also a few sweet moments and a few with more tension, which was good. Unfortunately, I found some other parts of the movie sweeter than the end, but it wasn&apos;t that bad.\n\nThe screenplay is nothing new, but then what movie is THAT original? Not many. The point is, it&apos;s fun and a good time if you want to spend an hour or so relaxing. Even my brother (who is a die hard action fan) didn&apos;t mind the movie.\n\nNo matter how original or unexpected a movie is, if it doesn&apos;t entertain me, I DON&apos;T CARE. This one was entertaining. Isn&apos;t that the point of films? Oh, and the soundtrack was a blast!"

It&apos;s nice.  It&apos;s even intriguing.  Its humor is low key, except where it&apos;s laugh-out-loud, which was in several places when I saw it (25 yr. old black woman and 50 yr. old white guy, 15 rows apart, the only 2 in the theater; we laughed at different parts, but we laughed).\n\nLuke Wilson is terrific, a curious blend of David Duchoveny and Bill Pullman.  I&apos;ll go to his next movie.  Natasha Henstridge can actually act! Brava!\n\nOK, so it&apos;s not an Oscar contender.  I go into a theater to enjoy a movie, not to trash it, and I enjoyed this one just fine."

This DVD set is NOT for the casual viewer and sometimes I wonder why I watched the films--as some of them were VERY artsy and weird! \n\nChick Strand made this film about women who worked at a company that made papier-mâché fruit. It&apos;s less about the fruit and more about the women themselves that the film explores. At times, it consists of LOTS of very closeup shots of the women and their hands--with the sort of framing, odd composition and choppy cuts you&apos;d expect in an art film. Not surprising, these Mexican workers speak Spanish through most of the film and Strand translates it in text for the viewers. Much of what they talk about is gossip. Later, the ladies drive to some swimming pool with their kids and the men--as Mexican music plays. Then, they take a break to eat, play cards and gossip some more. Then, they return to work and get paid. Then, you learn that the boss ran off with another woman and his wife now runs the place...and is rich.\n\nAll in all, this film is impossible to rate. It certainly would hold no interest to the average person but is meant as more of an art film--so I&apos;ll withhold a numerical rating. I didn&apos;t particularly enjoy it, though."

She&apos;s beautiful, ambitious, and completely ruthless - it&apos;s a deadly combination. She&apos;s perfectly capable of chewing-up and spitting-out anyone who gets in her way. And, she&apos;s not above committing a little murder if the need should arise. Brooks gives a dynamite performance as far as I&apos;m concerned. The rest of the cast is adequate, but nothing spectacular. The weakest point in the film, unfortunately, comes in the final scene. It&apos;s almost as if the screenwriters had no idea how to end Blond Ice. What they came up with is so ridiculous and out of character that it really hurts the overall film.\n\nA word on the DVD - from what I&apos;ve read, the VCI disc is the only way to go. The price is not much more than what you would pay for the Alpha DVD and the VCI disc has a much better transfer and a plethora of features.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1991 after a Cannes Film Festival Market screening.\n\nAn old-fashioned period drama, &quot;Wicked&quot; is a well-acted and well-mounted miniature, posing a woman&apos;s problems in a turn-of-the-century mental hospital.\n\nOpening scene&apos;s lush setting and attractive costumes suggests an attempt to enter &quot;A Room with a View&quot; territory; and Julian Sands from that 1985 hit toplines as a dedicated yon psychologist. Film jumps ahead seven years to heroine Giuliana De Sio&apos;s breakdown following the death of her daughter. She checks into a Swiss clinic run by old-fashioned Erland Josephson, who assigns Sands to her case. The eager young doctor is intent on trying out his new Freudian methods but runs into conflict with Josephson.\n\nSands even travels to Italy to interview relatives and friends in order to get to the bottom of De Sio&apos;s traumas. He helps her adjust, in a simply staged bittersweet finale. Film surprisingly does not develop a romance between Sands and De Sio.\n\nWith attractive lensing by Daniele Nannuzzi and a warm score by Armando Trovajoli, director Carlo Lizzani relies on a traditional approach to storytelling. Though the mature beauty of De Sio is displayed in tasteful nude scenes, film eschews the gross effects of modern cinema.\n\nDe Sio, whose English dialog is well-synched, does an excellent job of physical acting to suggest her unbalanced condition in subtle ways. Sands is a solid foil while comic relief is ably provided by De Sio&apos;s loyal servant Francesca Ventura.\n\nAll tech credits are above average in a pleasant but slight feature."

Gary Cooper and Madeleine Carroll look embarrassed throughout speaking those silly lines.Preston Foster as the third party of the love triangle has one of his more substantial parts in his career.But it is fun to watch Paulette Goddard&apos;s hilarious overacting.As her villainous father George Bancroft isn&apos;t far behind in that department.The best acting are provided by the two veterans Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman who provide some comic relief.The movie is beautiful to look at in bright colors and passes the afternoon quite painlessly.",

This movie is also pretty much exactly what you&apos;d expect from a Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger pairing except maybe fewer one liners and a decent script.\n\nThe story follows Sly as an incarcerated security expert (he literally wrote the book on prison security) whose last job sees him being sent to &quot;The Tomb&quot; a master prison based on of his own design but he&apos;s also been set up, imprisoned and disappeared for real. Now with the help of fellow inmate Emil (Arnie) Rottmayer, he must devise a daring, nearly impossible plan to escape as well as eluding the evil warden and his sadistic lead guard.\n\nI enjoyed this movie for what it was, although more serious than I expected, I liked the look of the super prison -unique in that respect and I was very surprised by the location of it, didn&apos;t see that coming at all. A good story, a few twists, decent supporting cast in bad guy (done so well) Jim Caviezel, evil guard Vinnie Jones and brow beaten prison doctor Sam Neil. Decent action scenes from guys who can&apos;t run anymore, Arnie can still fire a machine gun like no one else though. Sly does some tricky water stunts and some hand to hand fight scenes, he gets pretty beat up and tortured here.\n\nOn that note I&apos;m a huge Sly fan but as well as looking old here he also looks perpetually tired, like he&apos;s just about had enough of doing action movies. Arnie on the other hand was hilarious without even trying. I mean who else can make you laugh as they get water boarded? It was also great to hear him speaking German even it was mostly enraged swearing. 1/12/16",

      "reviewBody": "At a recent Dylan concert, my friend Charlie pointed out a shiny gold statuette placed unobtrusively atop one of the speakers way in the back of the stage. It was the Oscar which Dylan won for his Best Song &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from this movie, from &quot;The Wonder Boys.&quot; I was glad that my friend pointed out that gold thing in the background because it added a whole other dimension to the concert. There was a story behind the statue - the whole &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; story and I was glad to be familiar with it. No, Bob never mentioned the statue. Why should he? He&apos;s Bob Dylan. He just did his thing, played his music. \n\nLife presents us with the absurd as much as it does the mundane. Watching the way people handle the good and bad drama in their life is a hobby of mine. I liked the way Bob Dylan kept his &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; gold quietly present. \n\nMichael Douglas&apos; Grady Tripp doesn&apos;t call attention to his abnormally odd weekend, either. Douglas&apos; Grady always maintains his cool even with a transvestite&apos;s tuba and his mistress&apos; husband&apos;s dead dog and &quot;the Crabtree pharmacopoeia&quot; in the trunk of his ass-marked car. Grady deals with all of it. Grady deals with everything this peculiar weekend shows him - with a calm voice and an attitude mellowed from either age or experience or pot. In the here and now, he is calm and quiet but we all know that he&apos;ll have his anxiety or heart attack quietly near offstage with as few crowds and drama about them as possible. \n\nGrady speaks lines like &quot;gimme the gun, James&quot; matter of factly, the same way that his married girlfriend tells him she&apos;s pregnant, the same way he&apos;d order a drink from Oola. Why add drama and histrionics to the mix? He is what he is. Things are the way they are - even though things have changed. \n\nOne of the things that separates one human from another is the way we deal with change. isn&apos;t it? Personally? I want to hear about the absurdities of life. I like observing how people deal with it all. I like those stories. \n\nTripp&apos;s fellow travelers are in flux too - it&apos;s not just Grady going through change - his wife (unseen), his mistress (France McDormand), his editor (Robert Downey, Jr.), his students (Tobey Maguire and Katie Holmes) - all of them are experiencing an extraordinary weekend but there&apos;s hardly a voice raised in the storytelling. \n\nThe soundtrack alone is worth the viewing, thanks, Bob Dylan! And Curtis Hansen, Michael Chabon - tell me another story, please! If you can manage to bring a similarly wonderful ensemble cast - even better!"

I admit, I&apos;m not into this genre at all, but a cousin of mine spoke very warmly of it, so I decided to see it. It was boring 90 % of the time. I probably laughed once and smiled other two times... Maybe seeing it into a theater makes a difference, but at home we all felt like we wanted our time back! The actors were quite good, but I guess they weren&apos;t working with good material. There was a lot of singing and the Christmas songs weren&apos;t bad and they were even very well performed, but I wasn&apos;t planning to watch a musical! The story is nothing special and neither are the jokes. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to any of my friends!",

      "reviewBody": "When I accidentally caught this on HBO many years ago, I wasn&apos;t paying very close attention at first; but as the movie continued, I became increasingly intrigued by its quirkiness. Based on the 1944 book &apos;Miss Shumway Waves a Wand&apos;, the story takes place in L.A. and Mexico, and follows magician Myra Shumway (played by Bridget Fonda) as she escapes from her sleazy, wealthy fiancé and falls in love with detective Alex Ross (played by a young Russell Crowe). Things become more surreal as elements of film noir begin to mix with magic realism. \n\nMuch of the focus is on what Myra describes as &quot;that terribly empty space between my heart and my head&quot; – that is, the balance between the power of intuition and emotion on one side and calculating rationality on the other. Practical thinking alone, we learn, leads nowhere good. Love, on the other hand, is a liberating force. Unfortunately, in an effort to invoke &apos;magic&apos; in the film, the word is repeated too many times with an irritating lack of subtlety, especially by a snake-oil salesman played by Jim Broadbent. And that&apos;s the film&apos;s main weakness: too often it spells out its intentions and gives away its tricks. This said, I was still charmed by director Clare Peploe&apos;s daring playfulness. While the film isn&apos;t perfect, it has a lot of heart and feels a bit like a strange dream at times. The story takes some wild, unexpected turns and I was entertained throughout, even upon a second viewing. I couldn&apos;t disagree more with those who suggest Bridget Fonda isn&apos;t right for the role. She&apos;s fantastic! I find her quite believable and sexy as Miss Shumway. Russell Crowe is appropriately suave and Mexican American comedian Paul Rodriguez occasionally steals the show.\n\n&apos;Rough Magic&apos; doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously. Its kind of fantasy feels both mainstream and eccentric in a way that reminds me of HBO&apos;s Tales From The Crypt, only it&apos;s romantic, rather than macabre. Check it out one lazy evening, perhaps with the company of some magic potion.",

ME 108&apos;s were a two seater trainer version capable of carrying weapons.\n\nThe fighter version ME109&apos;s seen exploding in the movie Mosquito Squadron are models. Real ME 109&apos;s being far too valuable not to mention non existent as there were NO German ME 109&apos;s airworthy back then, only Spanish versions. The Spanish versions had a slightly different nose due to different engine plant. The Spanish Messerschmitts 109&apos;s were used in the making of the movie The Battle of Britain."

      "reviewBody": "The Dardenne Brothers have a habit of immersing us in the muck of life, then casually reminding us that, in case we forgot, we are surrounded by beauty. Their latest film, Lorna&apos;s Silence, is full of the trials of conflicted humanity with all too visible surface scars hiding its true nature. Set in the Belgian city of Liege, Lorna, an Albanian immigrant, is eager to realize her dream of owning a snack shop together with her boyfriend Sokol (Alban Ukaj), a long-distance truck driver. In order to pursue this goal, she has paid the sleazy mob-connected Fabio (Fabrizio Rongione) to arrange a marriage with a Belgian heroin addict, Claudy (Jérémie Renier), in exchange for Belgian citizenship.\n\nAfter divorcing Claudy, Lorna&apos;s plan is to marry again, this time to a Russian mobster (Anton Yakovlev) so he can get his own papers. Luc Dardenne says that the idea for the film came from a social worker who told them about an incident in which her brother, a junkie, was offered a huge sum of money by the Albanian mafia to enter into a paper marriage with an Albanian prostitute. She would then divorce him for another wad of cash and be free to marry a member of the Albanian mafia, both becoming Belgian citizens in the process.\n\nThe early images are all about money. From the opening scene where bills are being counted, money is constantly being handed over, counted, refused, or buried in the ground. The cold expression on Lorna&apos;s face and her abruptness in conversation tells us almost immediately that the marriage is a fake. Lorna ignores Claudy&apos;s almost pathetic neediness while greed pervades the atmosphere. She fakes being physically abused by Claudy in order to secure evidence for a quickie divorce but Claudy is unwilling or unable to hurt her. In a scene marked by ghoulish humor, she slams herself into a door and bangs her head against a wall to fill her body with bruises.\n\nThings become complicated, however, when Claudy vows to kick his drug habit and Lorna begins to care for him, resisting Fabio&apos;s attempts to eliminate him via a drug overdose. Dobroshi delivers an outstanding performance, as does Renier who has become one of the Dardennes&apos; most confident regulars. Though the film is more plot-driven and the camera-work less oppressively intimate than some of the brothers&apos; earlier films, Lorna&apos;s Silence is nonetheless a gripping, powerful drama, full of searing insight into the human condition. What is most important is not the story or the movement of the camera but the continuity of the theme of the awakening of conscience.\n\nJust when we feel that the characters have no place to go but down, the Dardennes tear us away suddenly from our addiction to the physical and hurl us into a world of tenderness and infinite possibility. As Lorna senses that she is suddenly at risk, she seems to break through the cycle of futile actions that have marked her life and, even in the mundane task of gathering wood to build a fire, we sense the exhilaration of someone growing before our eyes. As the Dardennes invite us to step into a bigger world, we hear the closing reverie of Beethoven&apos;s other-worldly Piano Sonata No. 32 reminding us that we are tuned into what the Quaker poet Thomas Kelly has called &quot;the silence which is the source of all sound&quot;.",

More V-2&apos;s were targeted at Antwerp than London, it being a major port used by the Allies during the invasion of Europe.\n\nVon Braun&apos;s relation with the Nazis was Faustian -- he was obsessed with space travel, and developing liquid-fueled rockets was a first step. The V-2 (A-4 was the military&apos;s designation) was actually counterproductive to the Nazi war effort, and von Braun no doubt realized that (as Hitler did not). It was not a practical weapon, being expensive to produce and burdensome to launch. Few actually reached their targets; more tonnage was delivered by one Allied air raid than all the V-2&apos;s carried."

But while they obviously do know, what some things feel like, they cannot convey that feeling on screen. Mixing that with poor editing, direction and story/plot holes, the movie-&quot;experience&quot; does lack quite a bit ... Again, I could&apos;ve given it some extra points for the noble cause it tries to achieve (spotlighting a troubled youth on the streets), but from a film point of view, this does not deserve it. I know that quite a few will disagree with me, but that&apos;s the way I feel",

      "reviewBody": "I liked this movie having seen it in the English dubbed version. I was not aware of any of the actors so the for-mentioned appearance of a Finnish Pop Star (Antti Tuisku) wasn&apos;t something I was looking for and felt the character blended in well as it was kept short.\n\nFor those that mention this Santa version vs the USA version, I have only one thing to say....The North Pole is in Canada, not the USA. And I think the Finnish version did a nice job of giving Santa (of any version) that classic look of what he may have seemed like in the beginning. For reference purposes the USA/Canadian version of Santa was created by the Coca Cola company for advertisement purposes and was never meant to become the North American standard version.\n\nThe movie to me was sad, funny and thoughtful. I thought it went a long way to give a classic children&apos;s myth a realistic beginning. My three daughters (21, 18 &amp; 13) watched this with me and all loved it. The only complaint was the dubbing. They had never seen a foreign movie before and assumed no matter where it was made the lips should match the English words......kids.\n\nI gave this movie a high rating based on what I saw. I don&apos;t look at the cinematography or pay much attention to musical scores. I watch a movie and it either resonates with me or it doesn&apos;t and this one did.\n\nMy only regret is that I don&apos;t speak Finnish so I could judge the difference between the acting and hearing the characters as they were written as opposed to the overdub.",

      "reviewBody": "Frost is a slow and baleful movie shot mostly in eastern Germany in Winter. The film follows Marianne and her young son Misha, although the wind is as ever present a character. Marianne flees her abusive partner entering the hinterands of the east attempting to fend for herself and her child in a depressed, indifferent and anomic atmosphere. Occasional moments of kinetic beauty serve only to briefly punctuate the gloom and each is chillingly doused. Frost is masterfully shot, with complex dollying and tracking that few filmmakers would attempt. Mr Kelemen who shot and directed the film is strongly sensitive to cruelty, the type of cruelty that is unmasked only to the vulnerable. The key to the film is Psalm 8, spoken in a church scene, which talks about a theological relationship between God and children. &quot;You have set your glory in the heavens. Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies&quot;. Perhaps the most sublime scene is that of a young boy dragging a piece of metal down a cobbled street. A klaxxon and a condemnation of those who hide behind their door, seeing no evil and giving no charity. Tarkovksy is often brought up in relation to Kelemen, but I was also thinking of the Dardennes.",

It&apos;s so much more than that.\n\nFirst of all, I found &quot;Homo&quot; to be the least intriguing of the 3 stories. &quot;Hero&quot; is actually more disturbing, showing the sudden disappearance of a mentally-inflicted, patricidal child who, according to his mother, was sent from the angels. I was particularly impressed by Haynes&apos; creative use of layering in the adultery and spanking scenes.\n\nBut, in blending three prominent aspects (color, black and white, documentary) of the film medium into his film, the beautiful b&amp;w &quot;Horror&quot; is the most notable, showing the sudden downfall of a scientist&apos;s prosperity. Haynes conveys the scientist&apos;s hysteria to his audience by using slanted, extreme close-up camera techniques and spastic editing, not to mention a haunting soundtrack.\n\nThe film is a bizarre one, indeed... but undeniably artful, and it certainly doesn&apos;t deserve to simply be pigeonholed into nothing more than a cornerstone for homosexual cinema."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not hard to see why &quot;Cairo Station&quot; was banned for 20 years in Egypt. It gained much recognition in Berlin, being nominated for the Golden Bear and Chahine missing out on the Best Actor prize on a technicality, but in Egypt the audiences, used mostly to the romantic comedies and melodramas Egypt&apos;s massive film industry was expected to release, found the film&apos;s darkly sexual nature disturbing, and the censors reacted in an even harsher manner. Expectations for the film were probably even further away from the finished product since the film starred Farid Shawqi and Hind Rostom, two big stars of the Egyptian cinema.\n\nEverything you hear about the film from Chahine and from Egyptian film scholars suggest that he put his heart and soul into making this film. If the gritty yet stunningly well-orchestrated visuals don&apos;t convince you that&apos;s true, then Chahine&apos;s passionate, masterful portrayal of the main character surely will. It really is one of the greatest performances of all time, and that&apos;s fairly surprising coming from someone who chose to stay behind the camera for most of his long career. There&apos;s not a single moment where you don&apos;t completely believe the character and the character&apos;s motivations and feelings, Chahine is just THAT good. \n\nThe storyline itself is nothing to write home about unless you view it within the context of Egypt when the film was released. The film is very reflective of the pent-up frustration that many Egyptians felt (one could even say that inner turmoil of the main character is completely intended as a reflection of Egypt before Nasser took over), and the events surrounding the main plot are hugely reflective of the transition Egypt was going through (in one spectacularly stylized scene Qinawi looks on as rock n&apos; roll is celebrated Egyptian-style inside a train carriage). \n\nThere are some brilliant moments throughout the film, but Chahine&apos;s handling of the final twenty-odd minutes are beyond brilliant. For one, he handles the change of tone spectacularly well, and his performance certain helps here. It&apos;s remarkable to watch a film directed by its star in which the actor&apos;s performance and the director&apos;s work feel so intrinsically connected- when Chahine the actor is dancing to rock and roll, Chahine the director is wonderfully playful, allowing the camera to move freely and capture the energy and enthusiasm of the scene. When Chahine the actor is at his most vulnerable and sexually obsessive Chahine works the film into a tense, spectacularly well-edited frenzy.\n\nThis isn&apos;t Chahine&apos;s first film, but it is quite possibly Chahine the auteur&apos;s first film. Although it contains a fair bit of Lang and a little Hitchcock (it is remarkably similar in its final stages to Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, which would only come out two years later, even some of the editing is similar), the film is mostly Chahine, looking at Egypt as only he can. &quot;Cairo Station&quot; is a film of remarkable depth, filled with great characters and wonderful performances, and featuring a spectacularly tense score. Beyond all that it is a film of immense technical precision and of unparalleled passion, and it is unquestionably the work of a master. A perfect film, the greatest Arabic-language film ever made, and one that I would personally rank as one of the greatest films made anywhere by anyone.\n\n10/10"

      "reviewBody": "I was initially lured in by the promise of the Elder Gods, so I believed this movie to perhaps be based upon some Lovecraftian theme. So I sat down and watch the 2018 movie titled &quot;Black Site&quot; by writer and director Tom Paton.\n\nWell, this movie wasn&apos;t all that and a bag of potato chips. In fact, the storyline was horribly mundane. Nay, it was downright boring and uneventful. So it was a major disappointment to sit through the movie, especially because it proved to be not very entertaining.\n\nIt should be said that the movie delves somewhat into a Lovecraftian theme, for sure, but without it actually being set in the world that Lovecraft created with his Mythos. So that was a little bit of a shame. And while the movie does focus somewhat on Elder Gods, it was merely an entity taken form in the guise of a mortal man. Yeah, talk about it being anti-climatic, but of course this was cost efficient. But wait, there is an Elder God about, a very Cthulhu-like being that you see in the distance throughout the movie (the same shot I bet). But this god-like creature serves absolutely no purpose to the story.\n\nAnd while we are on the topic of the story. Wait, what? This was abysmal, and it felt like it was something written by the hand of a 10 year old whom just started to read Lovecraft and wanted to make up his own story. It was just that stupid.\n\nThe movie makes very little use of acting performances, because there isn&apos;t the need for any proper or convincing acting, apparently, throughout the entire movie. Well, I can hardly blame the actors and actresses, because they virtually had nothing to work with in terms of script, character or dialogue.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don&apos;t get suckered in like I did. Some of us suffered through this movie so you don&apos;t have to.\n\n&quot;Black Site&quot; scores a mere three out of ten stars, solely because of the CGI and the theme of the movie. Everything else was just not worth the effort.",

An interpretation, suggested by the same Petri in his interviews, is to see &apos;Todo-modo&apos; as the representation of the nightmare of a Democrat politician (a representative of the highest governing party) in the 70s. The nightmare seen as a harbinger of imminent end of the Christian Democrats, not so much prefigured in the murder of Moro occurred two years after the release of this film, but rather in the collapse of the party took place with the occurrence of the scandal Tangentopoli of the early 90s. Petri, then, a visionary man? No, Petri was only an intellectual, a great film author who lived dramas of his time and Italy of his time, and by the lucid analysis of his works he tried to predict the fate; he tried to tell us in which direction Italy would go.

See what they did there) who manages to get a small part in Orson Welles&apos; (Adam McKay) 1937 production of Julius Caesar. The film follows the volatile relationship between Orson and his company. He is a madman, a selfish, arrogant user and an absolute genius. He knows how the politics of show-business and he knows people, and how to play them. However, for all his antics, he is powerfully charismatic and it seems generally accepted that he is a genius.\n\nChristian McKay&apos;s performance here as Orson Welles is wonderfully broad as he goes through every one of Orson Welles persona&apos;s with equal relish. He is snappy and arrogant but at the same time warm enough to earn some affection so when he lets a character down, you feel just as played yourself. The rest of the cast were great too. Zac Efron does his best here to leap from Disney heartthrob to leading man, and I personally thought he was solid and likable, with just enough of a sparkle in his eye and just enough skill to keep it there.\n\nOverall this film has a charming story, which ends on such a high note I didn&apos;t know whether to smile or cry. It also boasts a very strong cast and most importantly a sweet disposition that stayed with me for a good half hour after the credits rolled.",

      "reviewBody": "Many know the sad tale of the life of Bobby Driscoll who was Walt Disney&apos;s first live action child star paving the way for dozens more right down to today&apos;s Disney Channel. As Disney at the time The Window was made released their product through RKO Studios, RKO apparently had call on Driscoll&apos;s services and they got him to star in this sleeper of a noir film which I call children&apos;s noir.\n\nBobby is the son of Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale and he&apos;s got a big imagination forever telling tall tales. That&apos;s the problem, when he sees a real murder take place in an upstairs neighbor&apos;s apartment no one will believe him, not the cops, especially not his parents.\n\nBut murder was done in that apartment as drunk and free spending sailor Richard Benedict was done in by Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman. The body was disposed of in a condemned building next door.\n\nIn Disney products we&apos;ve seen all kinds of kids put in harm&apos;s way of many a villain. But because it is a Disney film we all know nothing will happen. Not so here. Driscoll is in the mean streets of a big city and a really bad man is chasing him. You feel his fear.\n\nThe Window got an Oscar nomination in the film editing. Almost 70 years later it&apos;s still a thrilling film to watch and the cross cut editing has a lot to do with it. Don&apos;t miss this one if broadcast.",
