Or conversely, it&apos;s like an Uwe Boll &apos;movie&apos; but without as much ineptitude. A young nubile chain-gang convict (C.C. Costigan) agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop wacky Kim Dawson&apos;s plans of...having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently (that vile fiend). Anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction, well you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film at all. First of all when did Kim Dawson EVER star in anything other than soft-core Skinamax level crap. For that matter take a look at the resume&apos;s for Costigan and the Director before you take a hissy fit saying you expected something else. Don&apos;t get me wrong, for a space/action/soft-core/titillation flick, this film is STILL not good, but if you expected something along the lines of &quot;Contact&quot;, I DO NOT pity you.\n\nMy Grade: D- \n\nWhere I Saw it: Starz-on-demand (Available until December 8th, 2005)",

      "reviewBody": "The last in a wonderful cycle of 14 movies that got launched by a different major production company but always kept the brilliant duo of lead actors Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and his loyal assistant Dr. Watson. Some say this is a much weaker entry in the series but, quite frankly, I have no idea on what arguments those opinions are based, as this is another marvelously scripted and professionally directed detective adventure! When an old school friend of Dr. Watson is found murdered, Sherlock Holmes immediately suspects that this has something to do with his latest collector&apos;s item purchase, namely a wooden musical box. Two other identical boxes were made by a convicted burglar in prison and the altered melody hides a secret code that leads his accomplices to the location of two stolen Bank of England printing plates! True, the valuable-objects-hidden-at-different-locations premise is somewhat similar to the previous Holmes film &quot;The Pearl of Death&quot; and may therefore come across as unoriginal, but the screenplay contains more than enough variety to make &quot;The Secret Code&quot; another very compelling mystery film. Holmes female opponent, for example, is a truly clever woman who nearly succeeds in setting a trap for our brilliant detective during a very well-mounted sequence. Furthermore, &quot;The Secret Code&quot; (I refuse to use the completely irrelevant title &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;) is fast-paced and contains loads of terrific dialogues. As usual, Bruce&apos;s character Dr. Watson provides the story with a couple of neat comical moments, most notably the scene in which he tries to comfort a little girl who just got traumatized by imitating the sound of a duck...impressively, I may add.",

It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It&apos;s also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.\n\nHe shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King&apos;s story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people &quot;will&quot; be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",

The Cold War was very real back in the 50&apos;s and as a kid you would hear, now and then,  things that would scare the pants off of you. What came first? The chicken or the egg? Was this a sci-fi flick that used the cold war tension or was it overwhelmed by the omnipresent tensions of said war? Don&apos;t know but it scare the heck out of me back then.",

      "reviewBody": "A very bizarre bringing to the screen of William Shakespeare&apos;s tragic love story.\n\nThe Que family and the Capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence. The hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. In the middle of all of this insanity are Tromeo and Juliet, literature&apos;s most famous &quot;star crossed&quot; lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.\n\nThe film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines. But the infamous Troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end. That makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10\n\nMany differently edited and rated versions exist. Each contains violence, profanity, drug use, and sex, all with a big dose of bizarreness.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary gets a lot of things right, but it unfortunately gets a few really important things wrong.\n\nWhat it gets right: for one thing, his films. It&apos;s pretty clear that once Paul Morrissey started directing the movies, Andy had very little if any creative input into them. The films before Chelsea Girls are completely different in approach, and certainly more connected with Warhol&apos;s artistic output, than the ones that came after.\n\nAs for Andy Warhol the person, I don&apos;t know if anybody will ever get to the bottom of that mystery. He was full of contradictions: he was a non-stop partygoer, but also painfully shy. He was a relentless social climber, but also enjoyed hanging out with colorful low-life types (at least until he got shot by one.) He was hardnosed about business and in the way he manipulated people, but full of superstition about his health and about religion. As for &quot;the philosophy of Andy Warhol&quot; -- he may have published a book with that title, but I think it&apos;s best to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nWhat does the film get wrong? I think primarily the nature of his painting. The &quot;experts&quot; they interview all say things along the lines of &quot;Andy wanted to remove himself from the process of painting&quot; or &quot;his work aims to present reality without any comment.&quot; Are they even looking at the paintings that are shown on top of their voice-overs? Throughout his life, Andy painted in a noticeably expressive, painterly style. He almost never presented a subject in flat solid colors, like the color-field artists. There is almost always some sign of the artist&apos;s hand in his work, whether it be brushwork in the background, or manipulation of the foreground image, by doubling, tripling, overlapping, varying the sharpness or intensity of the image, etc. By no means was he a Duchampian maker of &quot;ready-mades&quot;.\n\nBut overall, yes, if you&apos;re going to see one Warhol documentary, this is the one to see. Just try to go and see some of his paintings in person if you get the chance."

Fighting against the abuses of the legal system he though has realised that the only way he can protect the ideals he treasures so much is by representing uncouth drug dealers who do not appreciate what he does for them. All of sudden a young idealistic lawyer out of law school played by Robert Downey Jr, joins his firm in pursuit of the same ideals as Edward Dodd. The young lawyer, despite been an irritation to Dodd starts reminding him of the way he was when he started his law practise. One day in his disillusioned state a mother walks into Dodd&apos;s office asking him to defend her son who has been falsely accused and convicted of murder. The young lawyer convinces Dodd to take the case and suddenly Dodd&apos;s spirit is revived and there is meaning amongst all the hypocrisy once more. The two lawyers then embark on a perilous journey uncovering the truth behind corrupt police officers and state prosecutors who believe that the end justifies the means. Woods is brilliant with his emotional outbursts fighting for justice and fairness against a system which has let him down so many times. Downy portrays the young naive idealist to perfection. Lots of suspense and drama right to the court room climax guaranteed to keep you in suspense right to the end.",

I will give credit on the actual look and feel of the movie. It didn&apos;t look like a typical turd movie. It still is though. This kind of movie makes me wonder, what does it take to get a movie made? Obviously you do not need a decent actor/actress. You do not need a plot. I assume that all you need is a bunch of idiots and a camera. Well Sea of Fear delivers a talentless cesspool of cinema. In closing, STAY AWAY FROM THIS STINKER! Or you will wonder why you have just wasted a small chunk of your life.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening sequence was down right awesome. Right away Godzilla is out and about stomping through town. Right off the bat I have found things I liked about this movie. One thing that I liked was the fact that Godzilla spits his blue radioactive breathe instead of the fire-like breath scene in Godzilla 2000 or Godzilla X Megaguirus. Godzilla&apos;s look also resembles that of the Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla X Megaguirus movies, which is a plus in my book. I found it nice that they mention other monsters either then Godzilla like Mothra and Gaira (Green Gargantuan) in as previous monster attacks against Tokyo.\n\nThe movie shows some of he science behind the creation of MechaGodzilla instead of say skipping till the end when it is finished or something that some movies do. Other times like Godzilla Vs MechaGodzilla 2 the movie starts with MechaGodzilla already built. This whole thing is another plus for this movie.\n\nThe storyline is a little better developed then some of the other Godzilla movies. Some of the characters get a little more development at the beginning. Though it is hard to do in relatively short amount of time this movie still gives a nice storyline to go along with the monster aspect.\n\nNow onto the monsters. Kiryu, or MechaGodzilla, is the best version of MechaGodzilla to date. It is equipped with many weapons, which include the Absolute Zero Cannon that freezes things instantly. This is a nice touch to the massive MechaGodzilla arsenal. It still has some of the same lasers and missiles as previous versions.In all this MechaGodzilla is my favorite monster (aside from Godzilla) in the whole Millenium series.\n\nAs mentioned above Godzilla was given his blue radioactive breathe back (he did have it in GMK, but still). This time the breath was a combination of the blue and the fire-like one. Out of all the looks for Godzilla this is one of my favorites. This movie also has Godzilla get powered by electricity as it did in the Showa series.\n\nFavorite part of this movie has to be when Kiryu goes crazy and starts rampaging through the city. The whole triggering of memories because of Godzilla&apos;s roar was nice. This is just another good area of the movie. I mean it has the man against machine element brought in here while still having the man against monster element. Which in both cases for this movie it is man against their creations (Nuclear weapons made by man created Godzilla). This continues the great storyline of this movie and makes it a little more interesting.\n\nThe battle between Godzilla and Kiryu was nice. They actually had some physical fighting instead of just having Kiryu blast away at Godzilla the entire time. Both Godzilla and Kiryu got knocked around quite a bit. I mean the movie still has the lasers, missiles, and radioactive heat beams as all the previous movies, which is still good in itself. This epic battle is a great one!!\n\nAll in all it is an excellent Godzilla movie and should be enjoyed by any Godzilla Fan out there.",

      "reviewBody": "Nostalgic of late 60s and early 70s American culture, this film is hard to come to grips with. At face value it&apos;s nothing more than a poorly plotted road trip across the U.S. Southwest, as two guys and a girl, in a 1950&apos;s hotrod, race a guy named G.T.O (Warren Oates) in his yellow muscle car.\n\nThe film&apos;s concept is a little like that of the early 1960&apos;s TV series &quot;Route 66&quot;. But the approach here is totally different. Director Monte Hellman designed &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; as if it were a docudrama. Dialogue is minimal and not canned, camera work is unobtrusive with very long camera &quot;takes&quot;, none of the actors wear makeup, non-actors play bit parts, there are minimal plot contrivances, and so far as I could determine there are no indoor movie sets. As such, the film reminds me of &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970).\n\nThat&apos;s both good and bad. Lack of acting experience renders James Taylor and Dennis Wilson more natural than what could be expected with trained actors. It&apos;s bad because neither Dennis Wilson nor James Taylor could act, and their entertainment quotient is zilch. In performances, the film thus bears a striking resemblance to &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (1970).\n\nFor the above reasons, a lot of viewers will not like this film. The plot, such as it is, is super slow and the performances are drab. And there are no special effects to function as distractions. So ...\n\nWhat you have in &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; is a 1970&apos;s art-house film. What it lacks in entertainment value the film makes up for with its heavy-duty philosophical and existential themes. An economy of language wherein nothing in the film is &quot;explained&quot;, the tacit praise of the prosaic, and the almost stifling trust in the present moment, all speak to the human heart, as the voice of nihilistic romanticism. There is no freedom here, no escape, no change, nor redemption. The landscape horizon never gets closer. It&apos;s the myth of freedom and the embrace of alienation. No matter how far you travel, you never actually arrive. It&apos;s the journey that matters, on the devil&apos;s highway. But that&apos;s life.",

      "reviewBody": "This one and one-half hour long story takes us to the Krkonose in the middle of the tough winter. People who live there have their habits which are linked with a story about Krakonos - a good spirit of the hills, who protects innocent and punishes the evil ones. The life here is tough and people survives here only with the help of smugglers, who brings them food and proprieties vital for survival. Here, in the distant cottage, there live two boys with their numerous family, who believe in Krakonos so much, that they worship him at every their step. One day they see a Ski - new invention in the transport way and they immediately love it. They must have it at all costs. The story tells us how they steal the Ski which belongs to their teacher, thinking they were gifted by Krakonos, about relationship between them and another troop of boys, about fear from punishment and about never-ending hunt on smuggler, who uses Ski to escape the police every time and mainly about life of all the people in the hills. The movie illustrates beautiful landscape with such poetry, and the whole movie is full of feeling of no evil - there is no evil character at all - even the police. Everybody just tries to survive in hostile environment. The whole movie is a beautiful story - mostly a fairy tail and it is suitable for everybody - not depending on his age. I can recommend it to everyone who wants to see a soft, sunny movie full of snow and beauty of winter in the hills. And for Christmas time it is essential.",

      "reviewBody": "I guess I cannot agree with the ratings here on IMDb every time.\n\nFor example I just saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World rated 8.0 then I seen this movie, Love Ranch only 5.3 -- and while the general public still seems to be in love with the youthful glee based in symbolic fantastic fake X-box gaming TRONlike facade of Scott Pilgrim, they seem to rank an incredible life scenario reality based movie, Love Ranch which is based on a couple in their sixties based on a true story, as it were borderline doggy do. Once again, I guess most movie goers would rather not handle the truth.\n\nI must admit, when I was watching Love Ranch, I was reminded of the movie Papillon, in which they tried to fit a two week read into a two hour movie. I thought I was watching the same kind of movie making from a book being made into 2 hour script reducing it to bits and pieces of condensed scenes. But I guess it was merely a rushed screenplay and not a condensed book when I read about it on IMDb. I suppose part of the problem could have been the spontaneous direction in the seemingly rushed storyline. \n\nOther than that I would give this movie with better editing and direction of script a 9 or 10 rating because the intense reality and grip of the characters like between Helen and the boxer. This was incredibly well done... may sometimes been kind of unbelievable, but in the end their impeccable acting crafts both pulled together a gripping story.\n\nI think without a doubt it could and should have been handled better through production, but the movie itself is infinitely more meaningful than a teeny love triangular crap as in the movie I spoke of earlier. \n\nAll in all a great movie that needed to be nurtured a lot more to be made into a fantastic movie.\n\nGT",

On the way Old Surehand and Old Wabble are involved in the running conflict between settlers and the Comanches. Old Surehand can count on the support of his friend and blood brother Winnetou (Pierre Brice), the amiable chief of the Apaches. Bandits commanded by The General rob a train and try to put the blame on the Comanches. When the son of the Comanche chief is killed in town by a sniper, only Old Surehand and Winnetou are able to prevent a war between the Comanches and settlers.\n\nThis is the third and I reckon the best of the Winnetou films featuring Stewart Granger - it has plenty of lively action action, some comic touches that work and a lean plot with a couple of unexpected twists. It seems like this is an &quot;origin&quot; tale as far Old SureHand is concerned. His real name is revealed as Johnny Garden. Visually, it&apos;s striking. On the down side, Winnetou doesn&apos;t show up until 43 minutes, and he and Granger aren&apos;t often seen together. Well, it was known they didn&apos;t get on behind the scenes; Granger didn&apos;t think much of him.",

      "name": "Indie Filmmaking at its Best - Bong Joon Ho&apos;s Understated Gem",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m leaving this review to hopefully attract even the smallest bit of attention to this incredible film, that is sadly so hidden to mainstream and fringe film audiences alike. I believe Bong Joon Ho is one of the greatest modern filmmakers, who has gained a strong following due to films such as Memories of Murder (2003): a bleak and haunting serial-killer masterwork, The Host (2006): a comic and gripping creature feature, Mother (2009): an unexpected and layered murder mystery, and Snowpiercer (2013): a breathtaking Orwellian Sci-Fi tour de force based on a French graphic novel. If you are new to the world of Bong Joon Ho, I highly recommend all of these works. However his debut film, Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), is a much lesser-known work of his, but despite its lower budget and smaller scale, I believe it to be one of his finest creations.\n\nDanny Boyle once said: &quot;I think your first film is always your best film. Always. It may not be your most successful or your technically most accomplished, whatever. It is your best film in a way because you never, ever get close to that feeling of not knowing what you&apos;re doing again. And that feeling of not knowing what you&apos;re doing is an amazing place to be. If you can cope with it and not panic, it&apos;s amazing. It&apos;s guesswork, inventiveness and freshness that you never get again.&quot; I feel that this quote summarizes why Barking Dogs Never Bite is such an amazing film. It was Bong&apos;s passion project, and even though he lacked the experience and guidance that makes his later works so great, he had a nervous and adventurous tenacity that couldn&apos;t be replicated in the future. I definitely believe this to be Bong Joon Ho&apos;s most personal film, and one that analyzes the interactions between characters. I won&apos;t waste time discussing specific plot points or characters/character actions; that&apos;s the film&apos;s job. What I do want to share are the subtle themes included throughout the film that have resonated with me.\n\nProbably the most prevalent theme throughout the film is chasing one&apos;s dreams...or at least what one believes to be one&apos;s dreams. Yun-ju ultimately wishes to gain employment as a college professor, and is determined to do whatever is necessary to achieve this goal. But is this surely what he wants, or is it just what he thinks he wants? How do we even know what we want in life is what we truly want? It&apos;s not like we have achieved that goal to know if it is actually what we were expecting it to be. It is common to have a goal in life in which, once achieved, doesn&apos;t bring as much satisfaction as it was originally speculated to bring. Or it even may end up being something that you didn&apos;t want at all. The opening wilderness and closing curtain shots of this film, in relation to how they tie into the theme of achieving falsely desired goals is flawless filmmaking. Hyeon-nam has a similar experience with achieving desired goals. This film has several set pieces that play off of one another like a domino effect, which usually peaks my interest when accomplished properly (as it was here). There are also one or two segments of the film that have very little to no relation to the overarching story, but were executed incredibly. Specifically, one scene where the janitor tells a story about the building&apos;s boiler room, which introduces such a sudden change of tone, but is handled so skillfully. I really appreciate when directors are able to break the conventions of filmmaking like so, while still making it work to their benefit. This movie is also absolutely hilarious (probably Bong&apos;s most comedic), but the humor is very dark. That being said, there are so many witty, honest, humane, and even sadistic moments that made me laugh and smirk.\n\nThere are a few warnings that I would like to share. First off, there are a few scenes that depict animal cruelty and canine consumption (I&apos;m a dog lover, so don&apos;t think that just because you love dogs you won&apos;t be able to watch this movie). However, literally the first thing you see when watching this film is text that states &quot;No animals were harmed in making this film.&quot; You have to remember that at the end of the day, you&apos;re watching a movie, and the events depicted on screen are not real. On the other hand, Bong Joon Ho is also portraying how animals (specifically dogs) are viewed and treated in South Korea. The consumption of dog is not too uncommon, and that&apos;s a cold hard fact that you&apos;ll have to stomach (pun intended), not only while watching this film, but throughout life in general. In short, Bong Joon Ho depicts lifestyles that actually exist, despite seeming uncommon and harsh to other cultures. Secondly, I acknowledge that this film might not be for everyone. This is a small scale and personal dark comedy about human interactions. The pacing is slow, there is no action, and I wouldn&apos;t use &quot;pure entertainment&quot; as a term to define this film. But if you have patience and are able to give Bong Joon Ho a chance to guide you through his quirky little story, I believe this film can provide unique gratification. It may be hard to get your hands on a copy, but I highly suggest going through the effort to do so. This is a true gift to cinema, even though it&apos;s hidden so far beneath all the others that only very few have uncovered it.\n\nIf you enjoyed this film and want to see which others I recommend, or you&apos;d like to see my taste of films to decide if this film would be worth watching for you, feel free to check out this list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",

As good as &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; were in the 1980s, &quot;Dance Flick&quot; and others of the type are that awful in the 2000s.

      "name": "Fun film concerning a young man about to get married joins his three best friends to go with him to Australia for the wedding and chaos ensues.",
      "reviewBody": "David (Xavier Samuel) is about to marry Mia (Laura Brent) , whom he barely knows but fell deeply in love with her on beach vacation. For their ceremony they have chosen the town of her parents, in Australia, and the British David will travel there with his best friends: Luke (Tim Draxl), his main best man, tormented because he has just gotten out of a romantic relationship; Tom (Kris Marshall), who goes through absolutely everything and is a complete party animal; and Graham (Kevin Bishop) with lots of complexes. Mia&apos;s parents (Olivia Newton-John, Jonathan Biggins) will have no choice but to shelter this strange gang, first with excitement but then, after the wreak havoc they will cause at the bachelor party, with true horror and concern. Chaos emerges as the four accidentally steal drugs, are chased by a mobster, and get the father-in-law&apos;s prized sheep stoned. Will the wedding go as planned?. For better for worse... just got much, much worse !. Keep your friends close, but don&apos;t invite them to your wedding !. Is it a bad idea to shag the mother-in-law?. I&apos;m really sorry I shot you at your wedding. Australia! Haven&apos;t you seen Wolf Creek?. Who takes a gimp mask to a wedding?. The boofhead. The groom. The bridesman. The ratbag. The mother of the bride. The knob end.\n\nAustralian Stephan Elliot directs Laura Brent, Xavier Samuel, Kris Marshall, Kevin Bishop, Tim Draxl, Olivia Newton-John, Elizabeth Debicki, Rebel Wilson, Jonathan Biggins and the ram Ramsy in this comedy co-produced by the United Kingdom and Australia, so there are actors from both countries. A silly and fun comedy and filming took place in Blue Mountains, Penrith, New South Wales, Australia and Piccadilly Circus, Piccadilly, Londres, . The picture contains silly happenings, tongue-in-cheek, grotesque situations and above all, humor. Dealing with a group of friends take a trip to celebrate a bachelor party, and a wedding during which they will suffer disconcerting events and rediscover themselves.\n\nA team of Australian/British actors lead the cast of this riotous comedy in which a group of youngsters, friends from university, get together to celebrate a bachelor party and a wedding with unexpected results. Directed by Stephan Elliot and written/produced by Dean Craig , this is a fun and not at all politically correct cross between ¨Rough Night¨ (2017), ¨The Hangover¨(2009), &quot;Very bad things&quot; (1998) and ¨Weekend at Bernie&apos;s¨ (1989), also featuring supporting performances by Rebel Wilson as the rebel daughter, Jonathan Biggins as the unfortunate politician father and special mention for Olivia Newton-John interpreting an uninhibited &apos;mother of the bride&apos;.\n\nThe film results to be a crazy comedy aimed at a twenty-something audience, with a festive, uninhibited tone, with sexual humor in dating and friendship situations; but the jokes don&apos;t work at times, turning out to be vulgar and simple. Dirty humor is sometimes cheesy and gross-out with numerous naughty and picaresque situations such as sex jokes, bad taste and adult scenes , abounding sexual references. The actors son sympathetic and the directing is good, but the story is totally ridiculous, though there&apos;re brief laughs some times in the film. The film is average, but the fact is that it is also slighly funny. The characters are nothing more than stereotypes, clichés, with unbelievable performances that are not helped by a quirky plot.\n\nThe film was uneven but professionally directed by Stephan Elliot. Director Stephan Elliott is most well known for his comedy-drama film ¨Adventures of Priscilla, queen of the desert¨ (1994), one of two hit Australian movies released that year, along with Muriel&apos;s Wedding . Stephan ha made a few film with hits and flops, such as: ¨Easy Virtue¨, ¨Welcome to Woop Woop¨, ¨Eye of the Beholder¨, ¨Frauds¨ , ¨Rio, Eu Te Amo¨, ¨Black oasis¨, ¨Horizon¨, and ¨Swinging Safari¨. ¨A Few Best Men¨ (2011) rating: 5.5/10. Passable and acceptable but no notable.",

The casting is pretty good, with Michael Gambon giving his second big-screen appearance, but the genre was getting pretty tired by this point.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Musallat&quot; is truly one of the best horror movies I&apos;ve ever seen, thanks to its storyline, narrative style, and acting. Despite dealing with a very cliché subject, the intricate structure in the way it handles the topic gives off a bit of a Christopher Nolan vibe. With its unsettling stillness and well-balanced action that isn&apos;t over the top but still makes you jump out of your seat, it keeps you engaged with lots of questions until the end. Avoidance of slimy, overdone visual effects also made this low-budget movie even more impactful in my eye. Last but not least, Burak Çivit proved to be a very talented actor in my eyes with this film.\n\nPS. This movie definitely does not deserve a low rating. You might not give it a high rating, but there&apos;s no reason to give it less than 5. I don&apos;t see any good intentions in a rating below that.",

I mean come on.....26 letters with a different director for each one?!?! I was initially nervous thinking it was gonna be off the wall gory and snuff film like but its the opposite. Majority of the short films are comedic and has no horror element to it. I am not disappointed that I watched it, just the fact that my expectations were set very high and after watching letter &quot;A&quot; I knew it wasn&apos;t gonna be as bad as I originally thought. Now keep in mind I&apos;ve probably never heard of more than half of these directors so their style might not be for me but all in all it was corny. If there is a director that you really like their style then you may like it but without having any spoilers in my review the only letter I liked was &quot;D&quot; and maybe the end result of &quot;X&quot;. I hope this review helps everybody that has that curious bug inside of them.",

A beheading, preferably one where the head rolls to someone who is in love with the recently deceased. An innocent loser who doesn&apos;t actually die in the movie, but you wish they would. At least one famous actor in a small and likely irrelevant role. A utility worker of similar individual who gets gored while one of the &quot;stars&quot; looks on. If you agree, Jack-o is the film for you. If not, rent Free Willy or something. If you feel plot is important, you&apos;re in the wrong genre, I&apos;m afraid. Great for Halloween if you want to kill a few hours."

      "reviewBody": "A great comedy to settle down with after a long day.  Aykroyd and Candy make a great pair in this off-beat comedy about life in the woods, and how one simple vacation turns into a dreaded day-to-day horror. \n\n Basic Plot: John Candy and his family go up to Canada for a family vacation away from the city for several days.  Seemingly fine, until they get to their cabin, the whole vacation starts to fall apart from the moment they arrive.  Not only is there fish everywhere in their vacation home, but just when mom and dad think they&apos;re alone, their brother and sister in-law walk in on them, with their two daughters. From a water-skiing adventure gone wrong- to eating a whole family&apos;s worth of food (pun definitely intended.), the movie seems to continually take a turn for the worst.  The subplot is Candy&apos;s oldest son, who starts to fall in love with a local, to give it that romance along with all the humor that&apos;s going on between the adults.\n\nA fun movie to watch from 10- whenever.\n\nI give it a 7.5 out of 10 (10 being the highest).  Not one of the best movies ever but certainly funny and it has some great writing too.\n\nA little piece of trivia:\n\nAt the end of &quot;She&apos;s Having a Baby&quot; right before the credits, you see the wife asking Kevin Bacon what they should name the baby... People from all sorts of films and T.V. shows voice their opinions, including some of the cast members from &apos;The Great Outdoors&apos;.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the end of this review."

      "reviewBody": "There are books and films. Two different ways of telling a story. Sometimes films are based on books. In that case one does good by not concentrating on the book and see the film as an independent work of art. Barthes already proclaimed &apos;the death of the writer&apos;, the discourse is not a message of the writer. But sometimes it&apos;s impossible to ignore the writers&apos; work and his message. This is the case with one of this centuries&apos; most important writers, Primo Levi. He didn&apos;t just write books, but was able to put in words his very own experiences in the German Lagers and this way put it in a much broader sense, he wrote history.\n\nMany years before, Rosi had succesfully filmed &apos;christ stopped at Eboli&apos;, which was also based on an autobiography (Carlo Levi, not related to Primo) of the fascist period. Rosi did well not to choose Primo Levi&apos;s &apos;if this is a man&apos; (se questo e un uomo), which describes the unimaginable experiences of Levi in the German Lager, he chose what could be called its&apos; &apos;sequel&apos;. &apos;the truce&apos; (&apos;la tregua&apos;) in which Levi describes his journey home from the camp in Poland to Turin, Italy, which took him an absurd nine months.The film starts when killingfactory Auschwitz-Birkenau is liberated by the Russians and the survivors are freed and put in trains, not to go home directly, but to be send to other camps. From there the journey continues, by train, by foot, meeting various characters. Levi, played by John Torturro, is a silent man who now and then expresses wise words or memorable sentences, but somehow never really makes you think. It&apos;s a man we follow, but doesn&apos;t touch us, let alone move us. This is not Turturro&apos;s fault, he gives a fairly good performance, but Rosi wants too much tell an important story, forgetting the ones who ARE the story; namely the characters. None of them is very well worked out. Take the Greek Nahum, in the book a surpising, colourful person, here just one-dimensional. Symbolism is overly present; Levi who doesn&apos;t want to throw away his campjacket, &apos;to remember&apos; is credible, but the survivors are faced with german prisoners twice and it&apos;s given an unconvincing weight, as one German throws himself on his knees, when he sees Levi and his yellow star of David, far too grotesque. Another unconvincing role is given to the music, it&apos;s overly present, even a violin is stolen (where Rosi had this idea from is very unclear??) for no good reason. Music should be on the background.\n\nI am sure Rosi had good intentions, but sometimes it&apos;s better to read and reread a book and try to reach as many people as possible in that way.\n\n**out of ***** If this is a man (se questo e un uomo)-primo Levi The truce (La tregua) - Primo levi The saved and the drowned (I sommersi e i salvati)-Primo levi"

Glenn Close is a towering figure throughout as Albert Nobbs, a butler at an upscale hotel in Dublin. Close and Mia Wasikowska are both magnificent in this saga of gender identity. Nobbs is dressed as a man in order to work and survive in a world better suited to being a male and she is searching for who and what she should be. Her dream of opening a shop with a woman she has fallen in love with, well played by Wasikowska is deeply affecting. \n\nJanet McTeer and Brendan Gleeson round out a perfect ensemble cast as they are two of the best actors working today. Gleeson brings some comic relief as the resident doctor and McTeer gives a sympathetic ear and emotional support to Close.\n\nSinead O&apos;Connor sings the final song as the credits roll. The story is a sad one but due to the great cast it is a movie worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Crash caused a huge stir in the United Kingdom. Many conservatives were outraged by the combination of sex, already an issue of danger because of aids, and traffic accidents. Dangerous driving is like smoking, a subject that you just can&apos;t touch without many moral watchdogs chasing you through a hellish puritan junkyard.\n\nI remember seeing this and a middle aged to elderly man in the theater began to quite obviously...ahem...trouser cough. This was one hell of a way to clear the cinema! That moment is pretty much like this film. Crash has weird sex and masterbation, stuff that you do not really want to see. But David Cronenberg with the help of James Ballard drags us into a world that just takes the whole &apos;I love cars&apos; boy racer thing way too far! It is just not healthy...\n\nBallard writes in a bleak monotone. A monotone that Chuck Palahniuk seeks to imitate unsuccessfully. All of his characters are alien because of their lack of emotion. Cronenberg takes this aspect and runs with it. This makes the film good not because of the familiarity and sympathy that the viewer can build with the characters. It is actually quite the opposite, the film strikes the viewer because of the sheer UNREALITY of what is happening. The complete and utter icy way that everything is presented just leaves the viewer going &apos;what?&apos; Am I watching a bunch of jellyfish here?  The characters are so jaded. Trying desperately to experience emotion in an industrialized emotionless world. A world that has become nothing more than a production line. Good Ford! Sorry, Huxley joke. Nerdy but necessary.\n\nAlso, Cronenberg is presenting a discourse that the famous intellectual Donna Haraway puts forward. That basically the human race has become cyborgs. The the human form is constantly changing. That machines are changing our humanity and crash seems to say that our own sexuality can mingle with the mundane machines that we hold so dear. Oh no! I am getting flashbacks of the crazed artist Stellarc...no...no...no! Besides I bet in the future, terminators would make much more money as sexual partners, rather than as assassins. Imagine that, a beautiful spouse who always thinks your right and never argues with you. I LOVE THE FUTURE!\n\nSex is considered to be the ultimate joining of two people. The most intimate way that human beings can connect to one another. Wrong! This film suggests that sex means...well, nothing really. Procreation and a simple physical reaction. This is shown by James Spader and his wife&apos;s, Deborah Unger, relationship. These two are so jaded they tell each other their sexual adventures for attempted excitement but feel absolutely nothing. Certainly not some sought of emotional closeness to one another.\n\nThis film is just so incredibly empty. But it is also a comment on the human condition. How we make almost suicidal attempts to attain pleasure. If this was a film about heroin for instance, about junkies, this film would be much more understandable. Ballard has taken this addictive, self destructive behaviour and replaced it with an everyday object. The motor car. It is a brilliantly simple idea! But look at how many people it has horrified and offended! C&apos;mon people, are we really this stupid? Sex and drugs, sex and violence. Sex, drugs and violence. These things are all o.k. Portrayed constantly in Hollywood movies. Van Diesel anybody? But sex and car accidents, how dare you? What kind of a sick freak are you??!! Consider how hypocritical this is when you watch something like Fast and the Furious.\n\nThis is also a film that features the psychological nature of fetish heavily. Instead of having the common fetish for breasts or bottoms, which again people might find more understandable. The fetish is actually for wounds and crash test dummy videos! That scene with Rosanna Arquette, ewww! Would that work? This is definitely something that no one should try at home.\n\nDavid Cronenberg really deserves credit for making this film. He really has some big balls and respects the intelligence of the audience, which I however do not. All of the actors deserve much credit for taking on some truly difficult material. They must really trust the director. I&apos;m surprised no one said &apos;no David, you are out to lunch on this one!&apos; This film could have become a parody so easily. Never have I seen a film where everyone in the audience seemed so uncomfortable with the material. In fact, when I saw this film without the trouser coughing, people still walked out. It hasn&apos;t been since Salo that I have see a movie upset so many people. I give this 8 out of 10 for sheer weirdness. A great moment in a   major auteur&apos;s career who is not afraid to take risks. Hollywood take note!",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes the power in the imagery of a film alone tells an ambiguous tale that can be taken in many directions by a viewer. With the plethora of documentaries on the Iraq and Afghanistan adventures pushing you this way or that, it was incredibly refreshing to see one that had its intentions somewhere else. Just present the war and its impacts and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nPeople made a big deal last year about Restrepo showing the intensity of moments in combat. That film, while great, doesn&apos;t even touch what young Danfung Dennis achieves here. The up close intimacy of the war moments took the most brazen courage to compile, but the shots are so beautifully constructed you truly can touch the daring and fear of those moments. I have only felt this before in narrative films like The Hurt Locker.\n\nBut the footage of the struggle this troubled soldier endures in his recovery from crippling injuries is equally compelling, frightening and heartbreaking. The sewing together of the two worlds presented has a power all its own.\n\nI really believe this amazing young filmmaker, who really gives his all to the art in this film, deserves recognition. It won the documentary jury prize at Sundance. It now has been shortlisted by the Oscars for nomination consideration. These are so deserved.",

Not quite knowlegdeable what is going on at that side of the ocean, I can only find the resemblances with my own country (Turkey), which is on par with Brazil in terms of industrialization, wealth and education. What you see in the film is streets are dangerous in many ways. Thievery, trickery and violence are present and politics are involved too. But it is very fortunate that this film is not totally a cold-hearted judgment of society of Brazil. Fantastic elements are incorporated so well that the result is very amusing in some sequences but it still leaves ashes in your mouth. Characters are greatly genuine and colorful and and script makes you curious about the book it is based upon. You just wanna watch more and you stumble upon its anarchic and modernistic wisdom. You needn&apos;t dig very deep to get the best out of this movie yet it touches nicely to the matters of society in Brazil. As you watch just be curious more and more about Brazil&apos;s problems. A very impressive movie hard to fault that deserves 8 out of 10.",

I don&apos;t know if the version I saw was cut (the box said &quot;Hard R Cable Version&quot;), but overall, pretty unerotic.\n\nSylvester Stallone (the only real reason why anyone would watch this) turns in a pre-fame role as Stud, an Italian muscleman who has sex with his girlfriend Kitty and has a party at his house where lesbianism, anal sex, and orgies abound. Sly is looking pretty good here, better than he would in later years, and anyone looking for him in full nudity should be pleased here. Otherwise, there isn&apos;t much else to recommend. The only other male cast member is an unattractive no-name and none of the women are particularly memorable. There&apos;s a black stripper, a lesbian scene (overlong and boring), the 2nd man and his girlfriend have anal sex, and finally, the orgy that lasts FOREVER! This orgy scene only picks up when the camera is on Sly; otherwise, is not very erotic. Other unbelievable scenes: Sly flexes his muscles in a mirror while watching a lesbian scene, a woman flashes Sly in the park, Sly rapes Kitty after she slaps him, and the film ends with Sly slapping Kitty.\n\nUnder 60 minutes long, very cheaply done, and not very stimulating outside of Sly&apos;s scenes, ITALIAN STALLION is only recommended for those seeking out celebrity porn and no one else.",

I saw this when I drifted into Telluride on a trip home from California. I decided to view it during a free afternoon at the Mountain Film Festival, and it hasn&apos;t left me since. What an amazing story! I&apos;m looking for it on DVD, but the film seems to have disappeared. I do hope there are plans for a U.S./Netflix release. I know American audiences would love it.\n\nAll the best to you John!",

Brooks has made some of the funniest movies of our time (&quot;The Producers&quot;, &quot;Brazing Saddles&quot;, &quot;High Anxiety&quot;, etc.) and I think &quot;Spaceballs&quot; is up there in the same league. This film spoofs the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies in general, but there&apos;s also references to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; just to name a few. The actors are all very funny, with Brooks in two roles: President Skroob and Yogurt (his version of Yoda); the late John Candy as Barf the mawg (half man, half dog); Rick Moranis as the Darth Vader clone Dark Helmet; Bill Pullman as Lone Starr, the Luke Skywalker takeoff; Daphne Zuniga as Princess Vespa, similar to Princess Leia; and Dot Matrix, the robot with the voice of Joan Rivers who&apos;s obviously in the C-3P0 role. There&apos;s plenty of silly gags throughout &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and I laughed most of the time. Very funny, entertaining sci-fi comedy from one of the great comedic filmmakers of all time. \n\n***1/2 (out of four)",

It really touches the viewer in a way that makes you realize we are all the same on a basic level, animals and mankind. They are so innocent that it makes me grieve for what we have done to affect their environment and right to be free and live full lives. I found myself laughing, crying, and feeling deeply moved by these animals and those who are saving them. This is a fantastic documentary. And Morgan Freeman narrates, which is sort of icing on the cake."

Hitchcock definitely pushed the boundaries with Marnie, in many ways it was ahead of its time, tackling subjects that are this time weren&apos;t often talked about.\n\nWhat&apos;s so interesting about this film, is learning what makes Marnie tick, the history with her mum, and her terror of blood, you have to wait to learn everything, but its worth the wait.\n\nThe filming and camera work are terrific, so many scenes are memorable, that moment where Marnie is raiding the safe, with the cleaner at work the other side of the door, that was great, that moment where Mark leans over her on the ship, that was also a great piece of filming.\n\nTwo incredible performances, Tippi Hedren is perfect as Marnie, she&apos;s conniving, smart, broken, but glamorous and determined. Connery is the perfect counter balance, he&apos;s tough, forthright, confident and fiendishly handsome, the pair combine incredibly well.\n\nIt deserves more acclaim.\n\n9/10.",

Every now and then I&apos;d describe the crazy ending and horrible acting to friends, but for the most part it stayed below my radar.\n\nThen I read a review about &quot;Best Worst Movie&quot;, co-directed by the actor who played the kid. I didn&apos;t know that &quot;Troll 2&quot; had such a furious following. The film is being four walled at the Village East Cinema this week, and I thought I&apos;d check it out. I expected that I would be one of the few people there. Imagine my surprise when there was a line to get in!\n\nI thought the movie was a delight! Most of the actors in the film have moved on and take there odd notoriety in stride. The woman who played the mother, however, thinks that &quot;Troll 2&quot; is on par with &quot;Cassablanca&quot;. The director, who seems to think he&apos;s the heir to Fellini&apos;s throne, genuinely thinks he made a great film and a parable about modern society. Still, everyone seems to have had a great time making this film. Like &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Best Worst Movie&quot; celebrates the people who made the movie. They may not have made a great movie, or even a good movie, but they did SOMETHING that has endured.",

The daughter&apos;s detective like search for her father and her own past was so intriguing. Perfect cast and very good acting. Cynthia Abma is beautiful and acts great. Her scenes with Michael van Buuren are also very funny... but also sometimes very emotional. I cried several times during this film. I can&apos;t wait to see it again.",

It looks more like a video game than what the 2021 film looked like, which I prefer over this instalment. My 3rd point off is the plot, which I feel is slightly heavy for the age group we&apos;re going for. Again, I felt the 2021 plot was great, while keeping it super light and fun. That being said, this movie moves at a good pace, is quite entertaining, has many laughs for all ages, and does have some return voices which helps. My kids enjoyed it and want to see it again, we&apos;ll see if it gets viewed as many times as the 2021 version, which I&apos;m guessing I&apos;ve seen about 50 times lol!",

      "reviewBody": "This is the second movie based on the lucrative Belgian children&apos;s series from the mind of media mogul Gert Verhulst. Never having bothered to watch the TV show, I was surprised by a hilarious preview featuring all the right trailer ingredients. For instance we see the popular Plop shouting towards a backtracking camera: &quot;Grootvadertje, ik kom er aaaaaaaan!&quot;, Gary Oldman style (twice). We soon learn why: old grandfather Knap is at deaths door and the only cure grows in Kabouter Plop&apos;s neck of the woods. Then we get an equally over the top voice over artist introducing us to three new disgusting characters (with great emphasis on &apos;disgusting&apos;). At this point I knew I had to see it.\n\nIn no time Plop&apos;s buddy Klus builds a computer generated balloon so they can reach grandpa before he croaks. During an unscheduled pit stop, they are bothered by the aforementioned dirty kabouters called Snot, Zweet and Spuug or something like that. Mr Trailer guy was not kidding about these guys, they really are completely disgusting. Still, without his mighty voice, it was somehow less funny to me this time. Luckily the regulars soon go up, up and away in the CGI Balloon that must be the most expensive thing ever produced by Studio 100 (but with all their merchandising profits they could certainly afford it). Unfortunately it still looks like something that belongs in a five minute TV show instead of the silver screen.\n\n Basically the whole franchise is a Smurfs rip off. All the kabouters have merely one character trait and their name tells you what it is. Instead of talking Smurfish, they repeat their own names as often as they can (Klusserdeklus, Zweeterdezweet). Plop normally has no personality at all (being the one to identify with), but this time he gets to emote quite a bit, fighting back tears from worrying all the time (but still saying &apos;Plopperdeplop&apos; constantly). One thing that does differentiate the kabouters from the Smurfs are their double sided caps (like a pair of bloomers on their head with the trousers sewn shut). These things have the annoying habit of &apos;standing to attention&apos; whenever the wearer is surprised. Unfortunately these guys get startled by everything. We get an erect bloomer overdose, with the accompanying whistle each and every time.\n\nOf course you cannot end a movie like this without including the standard Disney routine of having the most beloved sidekick seem to perish so that every member of the target audience is sobbing until he/she/it opens one eye. In this case it is not exactly our favourite sidekick, but I bet you can guess which character it is anyway. And so all&apos;s well that ends well and every one gets a Plopkoek to eat. It did not really live up to the trailer, but then again nothing could have. \n\n5 out of 10\n\nUnder ten? Add your age and divide by two to get the correct rating"

      "reviewBody": "If you like partying all weekend, getting off your face on. fizzy drinks, and listening to some of the coolest indie bands around then chances are this movie was made for you.\n\nAll Tomorrow&apos;s Parties is a collection of fan filmed footage from the festival of the same name, which takes place in East Sussex and Somerset at out of season holiday camps each year.\n\nIf you don&apos;t dig festivals or live music then you could be wasting your time on this but whether you love them or loathe them this is more of an experience than a film. It&apos;s loud, sweaty, sexy and enthralling.\n\nThere&apos;s no plot, no characters (unless you count the musicians) and there&apos;s no point. It&apos;s mostly a matter of sitting back and being sucked into the festival.\n\nBut because the whole thing is made up of fan footage, as well as some camera-work by the bands themselves, it&apos;s very disjointed and jarring in places but, for the most part, it&apos;s plain impressive. It&apos;s a lot like watching home movies of people you&apos;ve never met.\n\nThe editor, Nick Fenton, is a genius as is evidenced in the first 5 minutes in which a thumping beat plays to footage of the holiday camps as they used to be in the 50s and 60s: full of family fun, not festival stoners and their guitars.\n\nA lot of funny teenage shenanigans occur as the festival seems to be a gateway through which people grow up and music displays the shaky transition from teenager to adult. It showcases how people who genuinely love music will find a beat anywhere and that it&apos;s more than just noise.\n\nBands that are included in this musical mash-up are The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Mars Volta, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Gossip and a bizarre little cameo by comedian David Cross. If you don&apos;t like or have never heard of these people, I wouldn&apos;t worry because there is an eclectic mix and you&apos;ll probably find something you&apos;ll like.\n\nWhile it is an impressive collage of material, it does lack any kind of cohesiveness and could lead to a few dips in your attention. Also, its use of split screen teeters between visually grating and kinetic magnificence.\n\nA good film but probably best enjoyed when you&apos;ve had some fizzy drinks."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Prince Valiant&quot; is, apparently, based upon a comic strip, although I must confess that I had never heard of it before seeing the film. The story is set in Arthurian Britain. The king&apos;s magic sword Excalibur has been stolen by a gang of Vikings from the kingdom of Thule, so Valiant, a young squire, is sent to recover it. On the way he falls in love with the beautiful Princess Ilene (a name which can be pronounced either as &quot;Eileen&quot; or &quot;Elaine&quot;, depending upon which character is speaking) and discovers that he himself is in fact none other than the long-lost heir to the crown of Thule, which has been usurped by the current incumbent, the villainous Thagnar. \n\nThe Arthurian legends have not always transferred well to the cinema screen. In recent years we have had the decidedly average romance &quot;First Knight&quot; and the decidedly below-average epic &quot;King Arthur&quot;. &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, however, falls so far below average that it almost falls off the bottom of the scale. It is not a would-be epic along the lines of &quot;King Arthur&quot;, but rather a sword-and-sorcery adventure along the lines of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Red Sonja&quot; or (to take a more modern example) &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;.\n\nStephen Moyer makes a particularly dull hero, acting as though he were recovering from a serious charisma bypass operation. Katherine Heigl makes a pretty but equally uncharismatic heroine as Eileen/Elaine; on the evidence of this film she may have had the looks to succeed as a Hollywood star, but not the talent, so I was rather surprised that she has gone on to star in successful television series and films like &quot;Gray&apos;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Knocked Up&quot;.Edward Fox, who stars here as Arthur, is a talented actor who should have known better than to sign up for rubbish like this. \n\nThe one exception to the generally low standard of acting is Joanna Lumley, still splendidly seductive in her fifties as Arthur&apos;s evil half-sister Morgan Le Fay, but this only made me wonder why Joanna, who is one of Britain&apos;s most popular television actresses, seems to make so many bad choices when she ventures into the cinema. There have been occasional exceptions, such as her cameo in the excellent &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot;, but too many of her films have been awful ones- &quot;Don&apos;t Just Lie There, Say Something&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&quot; are other examples. \n\nEven worse than the standards of acting are the action scenes and special effects. The fight scenes were all clumsily handled and those alligators were ludicrously unconvincing. The storyline was often confusing and difficult to follow and the lighting was so gloomy as to make me think that the film-makers were interpreting the phrase &quot;Dark Ages&quot; absolutely literally. &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; is billed as a British/Irish/German co-production, which only goes to show that there is at least one field, the tenth-rate fantasy epic, in which the European film industry can hold its own against American competition. I can only assume that the film&apos;s European origins were the reason that it was overlooked for a well-deserved Razzie nomination. 2/10",

      "reviewBody": "In a time when we are almost constantly barraged with goofy spoof films, it&apos;s amazing that no one had come out with a spoof of the James Bond films until 1997. Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s, and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done, and he does a wonderful job at it.\n\nFans of the James Bond films will have a blast looking for all of the allusions to the old Bond films and trying to determine which Bond film is being spoofed at any given time, but it&apos;s important to keep in mind that the film pokes fun at the Bond series in good taste. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is never disrespectful to the films that it makes fun of, which is probably the single most important thing about a spoof film that makes it good. This is why the Scary Movies, as just a couple of examples, were such dismal, hideous failures. They try to be funny by viciously making fun of all kinds of movies, and end up looking stupid because they have such a nonexistent right to do that. You can&apos;t make a stupid, stupid movie and make fun of a lot of great movies (and some not so great, admittedly) and try to pretend to be respectable at the end of it all. That&apos;s the recipe for a crapfest.\n\nWhile it&apos;s true that a lot of the comedy in the first Austin Powers film is slapstick and obviously contrived, I think it should be a testament to the quality of the film that it is still so funny! We see all of the traditional Bond clichés in this movie, such as the usual one-liners (which are made fun of extensively and with spectacular effect here), the fancy cars, the goofy cockiness, the teeth-grinding theme song, and the occasionally inexplicable popularity with the women (this allusion makes most sense when compared to those Bond films that starred Roger Moore).\n\nThe plot involves a rivalry between Dr. Evil, an evil mastermind bent on world domination, and Austin Powers, a mockish caricature of James Bond, bent on stopping Dr. Evil&apos;s world domination schemes. Meyers portrays both characters with hilarious skill, making Austin an awkward womanizer with some serious dental problems, and Dr. Evil an evil schemer with a hilarious cutesy side. Neither character really seems like they belong in the role that they serve (as a spy and a doctor of evil), which is where a lot of the comedy comes in. There is also, of course the fact that they both spend most of the movie 30 years in their future, completely out of touch with the new world that they live in.\n\nThis is not a movie to be taken seriously, and quite frankly, I can&apos;t understand all of these reviews that I&apos;ve read on the IMDb that are constantly complaining that Austin Powers is so cheesy or so childish. I&apos;ve heard this same complaint about lots of other movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, but this one is especially confusing. I trust that all you people complaining about how childish Austin Powers is realize that it is a spoof based on a whole series of movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, right? I mean, that would be a hell of an oversight to miss that little detail. Austin Powers is one of the most refreshing comedies to come along in years, and it&apos;s sad that there are so many people who completely missed the boat on this one just because they pretend that the movie is something that it&apos;s not and was never meant to be. It&apos;s true that the movie is immensely immature and that it has unfortunately little re-watch value (one of the biggest problems with the film), but the quality of the comedy is unmistakable.",

      "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) After serving 10 years in prison for bank robbery, Driver (Dwayne Johnson) has only one mission in life, to avenge the murder of his older brother who was killed when they were double-crossed after the heist. Now a free man with the names and addresses in hand, there is nothing on earth that can stop him from killing all of them. However, two people are in the hunt to stop him, veteran cop (Billy Bob Thornton) only days from retiring, and a young hit man (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), both on Driver&apos;s trail. The race is on, and there can be only one winner.\n\n(My Comment) The story is simple and straight to the point, Driver wants revenge. Driver gets out of prison after 10 years, and he starts hunting down the criminals who were responsible for killing his brother. However, things get complicated when a hit man comes after him. Not only does he have to avoid the cops, but now he is also a target. Physically, the Rock is imposing in this film, but he only speaks about 2 dozen words in the whole movie. The Rock does not have much dialog, but his tough mannerisms and cold blooded killer facial expressions are enough. Billy Bob Thornton&apos;s performance as the sleazy cop is excellent. If you want to see an action packed revenge flick, this is a good one to see. (CBS Films, Run Time 1:35, Rated R)(8/10)",

I&apos;m sure street thugs doing drugs and guns etc might not act as if the cameras weren&apos;t there, nor would the cameraman smoothly and calmly film a shootout without cover.\n\nSome of the CGI effects were a bit video game-like which which I can understand on a low budget, but they could have disguised them better with some creative filters.\n\nI gave it 6/10 which is a good score for me, it would have been 8/10 for a low budget movie had the above issues not have been there.",

      "reviewBody": "From the beginning, silent film showings were not silent; depending on the status of the theatre, different melodies accompanied always those film showings. Coughing or marital discussions together with children howling were the music accompaniment in small theatres of towns without resources; improvised or popular songs were played at the piano in medium theatres in provincial towns; orchestras provided the music in elegant theatres in reputable and important capital cities.\n\nSome important European composers were seduced by the possibilities and importance of the cinema and composed or adapted their own compositions to be played live in those important theatres. This happened with the German composer Herr Richard Strauss who recomposed and adapted his famous and successful opera &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; ( The Knight Of The Rose ) for the screen, capturing the spirit of that musical comedy of three acts, not to mention that the screenplay was written by Herr Hugo von Hofmannsthal, the opera&apos;s librettist, and last but not least, the great German director Herr Robert Wiene, directed the film version for the silent screen, three German aces in the same silent project, certainly.\n\nObviously the German aristocrats prefer to watch ( while catching up on their sleep ) opera at the Opera House and not in a coarse theatre but it must be admitted that this silent film adaptation provides a good vehicle for lazy and modern youngsters to acquaint themselves with such an elegant musical spectacle.\n\nThe story: While her husband is becoming famous in the war, the marshal of Werdenberg&apos;s wife consoles herself in the arms of the youngster Octavian and tries to arrange the love affairs of her cousin, the baron Ochs, by presenting him to young Sophie. This baron is taken with her and the Marschallin proposes Octavian to be his &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; in order to present the traditional silver rose to his fiancée. But youngsters are youngsters and sex hormones hold sway over the whole world so for that reason immediately Octavian and Sophie fall in love with each other \n\nThis film adaptation of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; is one of the better of &quot;grandiose&quot; German costume films and Teutonic film operetta. It&apos;s an elegant and romantic film beautifully made in artistic terms ( excellent and varied set design, not to mention, obvious soigné costumes ) , technically excellent and wittily made ( flashbacks and a Sibylline use of the ellipsis ) in order to condense and adapt Herr Strauss&apos; opera original story for the screen. This hard task is very well accomplished, summarizing successfully three aristocratic love stories full of love conspiracies and maintaining intact the spirit of the opera on which it was based ( it combines the theatrical and cinema virtues very well ). It does not depend exclusively on its musical spectacle merits but works as an independent and original film production. The many classic court ceremonies and the elegant atmosphere makes for one of those delicious and decadent German exaggerated operettas that the aristocracy likes so much.\n\n&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; was excellently and recently restored by the German-French TV. Channel &quot;ARTE&quot; which reconstructed the missing end of the film with some stills and obviously includes the original Herr Strauss film score. The restored silent film was premiered at Dresden ( that German city that some bad-mannered youngsters blew into pieces sometime ago ) in the &quot;Semperoper&quot;, that magnificent Semper Opera House in which in the year 1925 Herr Strauss&apos; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; made its first stage appearance.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dance a waltz and sing an aria at the same time.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "I was intrigued by this film and it&apos;s premise. You have Steven Seagal fighting vampires, I mean that alone should interest any martial arts movie fan since he hasn&apos;t really done anything like that before. The film also stars Linden Ashby who can hold his own in action movies such as Mortal Kombat. But within the first five minutes of this film I came crashing back down to the reality that this is 2009 and Seagal has been relegated to the direct-to-DVD market. This movie is so low budget that almost the entire movie takes place in a hospital that is crawling with &quot;vampires&quot;; although we are told at one point that they are more like mutants. Actually they are more like a hundred extras running around with pointy teeth and fake blood around their mouths. This movie is so low budget that it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos;s direct-to-DVD movies look like summer blockbusters. Linden Ashby and veteran character actor Keith David spend all of their scenes yelling at each other in a military tent. Ashby&apos;s character wants to give Seagal and his vampire hunters time to clear the building and get the survivors out while David&apos;s character wants to blast it ASAP. If these scenes took more than one day to film I would be surprised. Seriously though, if I had Linden Ashby and Steven Seagal in the same movie I would at least have them in a scene together, not to mention a fight scene. Ahh, the fight scenes. Seagal walks around holding a sword for most of the movie. When he uses it, it&apos;s mostly close-ups of him swinging it at the camera. He uses a couple of guns too, but it&apos;s nothing special. He throws a few mutants around towards the end of the movie as well, but again it&apos;s nothing special. One member of his hunting crew who is on the show American Gladiators actually steals the show as far as action goes. His action scenes are actually pretty good and the only reason to watch this poor man&apos;s Blade. However it&apos;s not enough to recommend this movie.",

He&apos;s absolutely free of all his refined technical skills (latest films) and a real &quot;hooligan&quot;, provoking, and full of brilliant jokes. &quot;What have I done to deserve this?&quot; is one of my top-Almodovar films, due to magnificent acting of Carmen Maura but not only. Almodovar, not yet burdened by the reputation of &quot;maestro&quot; is extremely free in expression, he does everything what is allowed and &quot;not allowed&quot; to do in cinema. Terrific mixture of Italian neo-realism, (remember the last episode, when Carmen sees off her family and returns home..) marvelous sarcasm, parody on intellectual cinema, and a tart-like melodrama with too much sugar. This is called Almodovar, a genius who is not afraid to seem foolish and therefore never seems foolish. A genius of KITSCH! \n\nHaven&apos;t seen this film yet? What a lucky one you are! Be prepared for unforgettable impressions. And finally: Highly recommended for those who enjoyed &quot;VOLVER&quot; (these two films have much in common)",

      "reviewBody": "After watching and enjoying this film, I checked out the trivia section for this film and found that many of the events in this film are based on the real life unit they were named for in the film--including the banner on the beach scene. At first I thought this scene totally ridiculous and didn&apos;t fit the film--seeing it REALLY happened is amazing! This is an interesting war film even if it didn&apos;t get made until well after the war. Most people never think about the need for naval demolitions crews, yet their incredibly dangerous job is shown in this film. How dangerous it was and how they actually performed it was truly interesting for history buffs like myself. Seeing them often diving with no real equipment such as snorkels or tanks (these were only used late in the film) and simply free-diving to set demolition charges is pretty amazing. What was more amazing was seeing how they picked up these guys on the fly, so to speak.\n\nApart from the technical aspects of the film, the plot itself is somewhat formulaic but interesting. Richard Widmark plays the typical hard-as-nails commanding officer and naturally the men miss their old C.O. since he was &quot;one of the boys&quot; (see THE FLYING LEATHERNECKS and TWELVE O&apos;CLOCK HIGH and you&apos;ll see what I mean). The whole &quot;loneliness at the top&quot; angle has been done many times before, though this one was played a bit better. Having such pros as Dana Andrews, Jeffrey Hunter and Gary Merrill on hand sure didn&apos;t hurt! What did hurt, however, with the formula was that, at times, it made the men seem like whiners.\n\nOverall, rather exciting and well worth seeing despite its roots in Hollywood formula and a fitting tribute to some incredibly brave men.",

From the first images rushing through the streets of Paris until the blood-soaked climax, I was mesmerized. I consider myself lucky to have seen it in theaters with a good sound system becauseI have queried friends who have seen it on video and they had a completely different opinion of the film because they had missed key lines of dialog that really go a long way towards investing Killing Zoe with a certain quintessentially 90s vibe of doomed heroin-soaked romanticism, giving it deeper levels than most people are willing to admit.",

After Haute Tension stirred up a tremendous hype a few years back, films like Malefique, Them, and Frontieres are doing the exact same. But none of them have received the word of mouth that this brutal film has. Inside is a damn mean film. I think it goes too far in its excess, but that&apos;s what you have to do to shock an audience these days. And shocking it is. Can you imagine what the angry mob of parents that wanted to ban Silent Night, Deadly Night would think about Inside? If you&apos;ve seen it, you probably can imagine. If you haven&apos;t, I suggest giving it a spin. The less I say about the movie, the more powerful the experience will be. Inside is a film I will most likely never watch again, because I&apos;m sure I will never forget it."

An old wino beggar is attracted by the alarm in the alley and decides to robber the house helped by Sade (Ann Sothern), a fat hustler. Meanwhile, a dangerous gang of punks leaded by Randall (James Caan) invades the house and decides to eliminate all the witness after the robbery.\n\nI have never heard any reference about &quot;Lady in a Cage&quot;, but I decided to buy the just-released DVD and I do not regret. I found a tense, unpleasant, claustrophobic, sadistic and scary urban tale, with outstanding and impressive performance of James Caan. The story shows the lack of attention and sympathy of the urban populations, the violence of criminals against their victims and it is very ahead of time for a 1964 movie. I recalled the also claustrophobic and excellent 1955 &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, but &quot;Lady in a Cage&quot; is more realistic, frightening and brutal, and has not aged. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Dama Enjaulada&quot; (&quot;The Lady Caged&quot;)",

Compared to something like You&apos;ve Got Mail or Amelie it contained complex and interesting characterizations. It was maybe a little too long, but it was fun. There were many amusing little portraits in it, like the mother who couldn&apos;t stand to tell her neighbors that the daughter wasn&apos;t getting married. The role played by Csányi Sándor was delightful. There is a montage of girlfriends attending a singles club that is very poignant and concise and then later the mood created there underlies some of the more slapstick aspects of the courtship rituals.",

      "reviewBody": "Ingmar Bergman has left a reputation as one of the premier cynics of the cinema. A lifelong agnostic, he always held the belief that God did not exist and this life offers little, if any condolences to counter that feeling.\n\nAfter experimenting with various genres and trying to find his niche in the late 1940s, Bergman slowly began to establish himself as the finest Swedish film director ever known. This film, released in 1953, reminds me in many ways of the great Federico Fellini&apos;s 1954 film La Strada, also about a circus troupe and also focusing on the relationship between the aging circus leader and his female companion. Despite this common ground, the two great directors differ in that Fellini turns his attention to the joy and zest of performing and the difficulties that still lie within. With Bergman, troubles always abound and there is no shortage of sadness and sorrow. Indeed, none of these characters are truly happy in the way of the definition. Yet, they continuously search for some sort of satisfaction and happiness. Life is a long, sluggish journey that may never find its ultimate goal.\n\nDespite the downbeat tone, Bergman was a fantastic cameraman and his early films show him finding his footing, foreshadowing the great films he would make later in his career. Here, his collaboration with the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist has its beginnings as we see some fantastic angles, mirror shots and uses of depth of focus and framing. The acting is terrific, particularly by Harriet Andersson, and the script supports the story well. A small gem, but nevertheless a gem from the great Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film as a part of a Suzuki retrospective in Amsterdam, my first meeting with Suzuki, not knowing that it is all but representative for his more famous work from 50s-60s.\n\nThe plot of the film is difficult to describe because it is told almost without a cohesive narrative and totally non-linear and disjointed. I&apos;ve never seen a film that resembles a feverish dream so closely. Roughly the story is about man confronted by one man (a rich business-man) and two women (a Japanese Geisha and a European, who dresses like a Japanese women).\n\nBesides the &apos;narrative&apos; distorted uniqueness, which allows the characters to jump from one location to the next or pop up (even within the same shot), the other interesting aspects of the film are the locations, the visuals and inter-textual connections. Just to name a few: We see the protagonist on a range of different locations in the Japan of the 1920s, both in the city as in the countrysides. Also the European woman with her piercing blue eyes and blonde hair (only when the moon shines) is a fascinating image. Suzuki&apos;s use of distorted Japanese paintings as a backdrop and a No-play performed by children in the final part of the film send shivers down my spine.\n\nAlthough the film drags a bit in the middle, I left the theater with a positive, if slightly confused feeling. Maybe I liked it because it lacks any form of explicit explanation, just like a dream subjects you to an illogical and irrational &apos;story&apos; that somehow makes sense. It is a film that forces you to leave every sense of (western) storytelling at the door. Or maybe it was just because it is fascinating to see a film in which every next shot is the complete unknown.",

The most important thing in this movie isn&apos;t the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie. Combined by Jules Verne&apos;s own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and Karel Zeman&apos;s good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold one&apos;s attention until the end of the movie.\n\nThere are some problems as well, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly. None of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable. A gem that deserves to be more well known for today&apos;s audiences as well. A recommended movie for the whole family.",

A chick named Angela is right in the middle of a fight with her boyfriend, is hoping this hotheaded young man doesn&apos;t go off and shoot her, because she&apos;s really not into the whole living dead thing. Because if she doesn&apos;t survive, this new lifestyle will most definitely be in her future... So, anyway. now that Angela&apos;s undead, she&apos;s stuck in a world that&apos;s afraid of her. A world that hates her. A world that gives her very few options. For example, getting/holding a job will be almost impossible. And there&apos;s this whole thing where Angela feels incredible pain if she goes long enough without eating human flesh. She can pretend to be a regular person all she wants. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t, but without Human flesh, functioning is almost impossible.\n\nWhile being over-the-top, gruesome, and dark-humored, Zombies Anonymous has quite a deep, semi-touching story, which seems to be about adapting to a new way of life. Well, that and discrimination. Reflecting how people fear, and ultimately hate what they don&apos;t understand. If you end up diggin&apos; Zombies Anomymous, I&apos;d highly recommend a film from the same director, called Strange Things Happen At Sundown. One Of The Best Vampire flicks I&apos;ve come across. This Marc Fratto guy is one of the few bright spots in B-cinema over the last decade, and I look forward to anything else he comes up with. In case you&apos;ve ever heard about a micro-budget, shot-on-video from the 90&apos;s called Shatter Dead, Zombies Anonymous is basically a ripoff of that one. at least the basic idea is. Ultimately, this one blows Shatter Dead away, gore-wise, creativity-wise, &amp; entertainment-wise. you can&apos;t compare the two. However, I&apos;d recommend you check out both of them. Zombies Anonymous obviously isn&apos;t the traditional Zombie story. And I hardly see that as a bad thing. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Made just after Elizabeth Taylor had been made a Dame of the British Empire (DBE) for her services to the AIDS cause as well as her movie career, this documentary takes a superficial look at her life and work.\n\nNarrated in sonorous tones by Nigel Hawthorne, ENGLAND&apos;S OTHER ELIZABETH focuses on Taylor&apos;s origins in England, and how she lived her early life in Hampstead before emigrating to the United States on the outbreak of World War 2. With her fellow-compatriot Angela Lansbury, the two of them moved to California and carved out fledgling movie careers in films such as LASSIE COME HOME (1943) and NATIONAL VELVET a year later. Interviewed in the program, Lansbury comments on Taylor&apos;s innate ability to act in front of a camera, even though she never had formal training.\n\nAs she grew up, Taylor essayed more complex roles in GIANT (1956) and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1958). Sometimes she had to act with gay performers such as James Dean; she found a particular empathy in working with them, especially at a time when their sexuality had to be hidden from public view. CAT proved an exceptionally difficult film for her to work on; during filming, her third husband Mike Todd died in a plane crash, leaving Taylor devastated. Ironically she did not win an Oscar for her performance in that film, but won it for a far inferior characterization in BUTTERFIELD 8 (1960).\n\nTaylor herself appears as an interviewee in this documentary; she is remarkably frank in her answers, even though her countenance remains expressionless due to an excess of face-lifts. She admits to loving Richard Burton very deeply, and teaching him a lot about film- acting. She considered is scandalous that he did not win an Oscar for WHO&apos;S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF |1966), a film for which she won Best Actress for the second time.\n\nThe program skates over her later film career, concentrating instead on her work for AIDS victims, which began when she found out that her costar and friend Rock Hudson was suffering from the illness. She admits quite frankly that none of the victims wanted much, except to have a motherly arm placed round their shoulders, something she was more than willing to provide.\n\nAt the time the program was made, Taylor&apos;s movie career had virtually ended, yet she still remained a big star in her own right, the last of the old-style actors produced by the studio system. It&apos;s nice to see her being interviewed, making us aware that we will never see her like again.",

Making a film on a military dictatorship focusing the life of a child is also a script decision that often works very well, as I may mention Brazilian &quot;O ano em que meus pais saíram de férias&quot; (&quot;The Year My Parents Went on Vacation&quot;), Argentine &quot;Kamchatka&quot;, and Nicaraguan &quot;Princesas rojas&quot; (&quot;Red Princesses&quot;). This Argentine film is not bad and it is visually appealing: cinematography, art direction, the usage of drawn animation... However (and unfortunately), it is too tepid, excessively long and sluggish, and lacks a tighter script. Spectator never gets involved, the movie simply does not make specttor feels or velieves in what is portrayed on the screen.",

      "reviewBody": "It was a pleasure seeing Ida Lupino in this, her first significant role at age 22. She is sexy, pretty and more than a bit nasty. Sometimes dubbed &quot;the poor man&apos;s Bette Davis&quot; she shows here that she could have handled some of Davis&apos;s roles very well.\n\nThe story itself is a tale about truck drivers that pits them against the loan sharks and emphasizes the danger of driving without much sleep on roads not yet of Interstate quality. It takes place in California in the late thirties. Lupino plays Lana Carlsen, the bored wife of the head of a trucking company who only has eyes for Joe Fabrini (George Raft), who only has eyes for Cassie Hartley (Ann Sheridan). Humphrey Bogart plays his brother Paul Fabrini and really takes a backseat. That would change beginning the next year when Bogey would star with Ida Lupino in High Sierra (1941).\n\nIt is interesting to contrast the two films both directed by long time Hollywood legend Raoul Walsh. They Drive by Night has a distinct thirties feel to it and not just because George Raft stars. The sense of the Depression is still with the characters in TDBN as the truck drivers and waitress Cassie worry about their jobs. There is a sense of identification with the working man that is absent from High Sierra, which really began Bogart&apos;s tough guy movie persona.\n\nAlan Hale (235 acting credits at IMDb!) plays Lana&apos;s fun-loving and clueless husband, Ed Carlsen. Roscoe Karns provides some wise-cracking relief as Irish McGurn, truck-driving pinball wizard. The script by Jerry Wald is full of snappy one liners like this between Joe and Cassie. He asks, &quot;Do you believe in love at first sight?&quot; She counters with, &quot;It saves a lot of time.&quot; Wald later became a producer of some of Hollywood&apos;s most memorable flicks including Pride of the Yankees (1945), Mildred Pierce (1945), Key Largo (1948), The Glass Menagerie (1950), etc.\n\nBy all means see this for Ida Lupino, who to escape from the typecasting that began with this movie later went on to become one of Hollywood&apos;s first woman directors.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

Not only does the book contain the crude parts in the movie but the books is more crude and descriptive. The movie didn&apos;t add &quot;potty humor&quot; but took out most toilet humor from the book.\n\n2. &quot;The movie only had Gulliver rather than the many islands in the book.&quot; True. But the book had years between each adventure and would have been a lot to try to put into one movie.... besides the 2nd half of the book sucked (somewhat joking somewhat serious).\n\nAnyway... reviewing the movie. It&apos;s a good movie but not great. They did a good job changing from the 18th century to modern times. If you are looking for a fun Jack Black movie you won&apos;t be disappointed. And this movie inspired a couple of my friends to even read the book.",

      "reviewBody": "This is French movie about a real-life Italian killer, Roberto Succo (Stefano Cassetti), who escaped a mental institution and went on a crime/murder spree all over Europe. He was somewhat similar to American killers Gary Gilmore (the subject of &quot;The Executioner&apos;s Song&quot;)and Charles Starkweather (who loosely inspired &quot;Badlands&quot;). However, he was more a more prolific killer than the former, but didn&apos;t cause nearly as much panic as the latter--it actually took the police some time to piece together the various random crimes he was committing, which didn&apos;t immediately escalate to murder. The film &quot;Roberto Succo&quot; though probably MOST resembles the two later French &quot;Mesrine&quot; films (with Vincent Cassel), and like those, it seems to hew pretty closely to the real-life inspiration. Unfortunately, Succo was not nearly as interesting of a criminal as Jacques Mesrine, and Stefano Cassetti is not nearly as compelling of actor as the great Vincent Cassel.\n\nDuring his crimes Succo stopped to rather tenderly romance a naive, 16-year-old French virgin named &quot;Lea&quot; (Isild Le Besco). But she was neither really an unwitting accomplice in his crimes like the real-life Carol Fugate (Starkweather&apos;s teenage paramour) or a sexy &quot;moll&quot; along the lines of the real-life Nichole Baker (played by Roseanne Arquette in &quot;The Executioner&apos;s Song&quot;) or the character played by Ludivine Sagnier in the &quot;Mesrine&quot; movies. The unconventionally beautiful French actress Isild LeBesco does two things really well--one is act and the other is get naked, and she doesn&apos;t get nearly enough chance to do either here. Ludivine Sagnier has less screen time technically in the &quot;Mesrine&quot; movies than LeBesco does in this, but she is quite a bit more effective.\n\nThe film basically follows Succo as he commits his incredibly random crimes, and since Cassetti isn&apos;t the most exciting of actors, the film largely lacks a center and becomes quite boring. The police pursuit when it finally happens is almost an afterthought and the prison scenes at the end, while necessary to tell the full story, only prolong an already rather dull movie. It could have been improved with a stronger central performance, or if LeBesco had had a bigger role or had the kind of screen presence she would eventually develop in her later films (she is STILL by far the best reason to see this). Much of it though you have to blame on the filmmakers who perhaps stick TOO MUCH to the real-life inspiration at the expense of of making a very dramatically compelling movie."

I say &quot;seems&quot; because this is an often wilfully obscure film in the tradition of Marker&apos;s oeuvre. It ostensibly concerns a woman seeking information about the WWII massacre at Okinawa through a futuristic antecursor of the Internet, but who only finds repetitive images and foggy recollections. It seems to be a meditation on the replacement of ideas by images, and possibly a comment on we still ignore tragedy in our world even this information-saturated age. Though intensely cerebral, it&apos;s directed stylishly and has moments of genuine poignance, and references to classic French cinema which film buffs will enjoy spotting",

Mina came across as a rather melancholic high school girl in the initial part of the movie, who opens up to stupid and sometimes downright hilarious advances of yeoung. there were moments in the movie when the expanse of human relationship was aptly expressed and the momentary nature of life made evident. simply loved the movie!",

Having said that, with Marie Zielcke, it isn&apos;t at all easy to say whether she is a talented actress or just a pretty face with an attitude. Is she like Milla Jovovich, who isn&apos;t just devastatingly beautiful, but also a natural performer, a fashion designer, an accomplished singer, and a gifted songwriter? Or is she more like Keira Knightley, noticed because of her good looks, famous for being famous, but not really good at anything? I&apos;m partial. I like her. Ever since her big-screen debut in Oscar Roehler&apos;s &quot;Silvester Countdown&quot;, she&apos;s been on my &quot;must see&quot; list. Mind you, &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; itself won&apos;t make the list. A twenty-something big-city couple vacations in the desert and is taken for a ride by a mysterious stranger. Under the sand, they find jealousy and fear. &quot;29 Palms&quot; meets &quot;And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;, minus the sex and the music. Some panoramic sandscapes though.",

Compared to other documentaries this film is not portraying one person and his life, Raymond Depardon gives a portrait of a building. And in this building he stays in the entrance area as if this was a place which separates the normal from the sick. And while you listen to these different stories, see these very different life&apos;s and how they try to express their situation you get a strong feeling about our society and how it works. There is a bus driver who got a nervous breakdown. An old man who wanted to kill himself in the hallway of his house. A woman who gives a really strange explanation why she smashed a shop window. And a man who can&apos;t even tell his age nor what happened to him. The film rests on these people telling their story and then jumps into the next story so that the only thing which stays is the room and the psychologists who are asking questions and trying to help. After this film I want to see more of Depardons way of looking on our world.",

Nevertheless, while for now the audience may be divided as to cheering or jeering it, in years to come it will be celebrated in the &quot;So Bad, it&apos;s Good&quot; category, with an inane script and dialogue that draws out uninvited laughter. The only way to be entertained by it is to make fun of it to entertain yourself.\n\nBut the stars have made the most of it and look their glamorous best here. Hrithik Roshan&apos;s charisma and looks carry the movie while Abhishek Bachchan&apos;s stoic hero gives grounding to the extravagant set-pieces. Aishwarya Rai gives the most atrociously misjudged performance of her career. What should have been more of a hot Michelle Pfeiffer-as-Catwoman role became a Halle Berry-as-Catwoman role. That&apos;s if Halle Berry mixed up her notes with Alicia Silverstone&apos;s for her role in Clueless. Bipasha Basu lends a hand in disposing of any credibility left to the story. Both look amazing though and Bipasha especially gets credit for not glamorising anorexia.\n\nThe movie doesn&apos;t have the same infectious sense of fun that something like Main Hoon Na has but it&apos;s worth a watch as long as you keep one finger over the fast-forward button.",

      "reviewBody": "If anyone has heard about Valentino and wants to see what all the fuss was about, The Son of the Sheik is an excellent way to do so. Here he is five years past the overacting he exhibited in parts of the earlier installment. To top it off, he plays dual roles: the son and the father. And he does both admirably. The shots of the two characters in the same frame - touching each other, no less - are flawlessly executed. Generally, this is standard melodrama culminating in physical battles between the good guys and the bad guys and a final chase. Along the way we get a lot of exotic set pieces, lavishly furnished desert tents, horses racing across the dunes, smoky cafes in which dancing girls wriggle for tossed coins and a grand palace with spacious rooms and shiny floors. The intimate scenes between Valentino and the beauteous Vilma Banky are more sensuous than those of the previous film. Clips from these scenes will be familiar to anyone who has ever seen Valentino references in documentaries. Agnes Ayres reprises her role from The Sheik as Diana Mayo, now the wife of the older sheik and mother of his son, and she appears to have aged 20 years but is no less attractive. For Valentino, Banky and Ayres alone this is a treat.",

      "reviewBody": "Well written and terminally fascinating British sci-fi thriller from director Val Guest and writer Nigel Neale. It is a film of big ideas and planet-sized concepts that stares up into the unknown with a combination of wonderment and dread.\n\nOriginally a highly popular TV series, it spawned two excellent sequels and decades of creative Hollywood pilfering.\n\nBrian Donlevy is wonderful as Quatermass, a scientist with the bullying manner of a military drill Sargent and a fierce, pragmatic streak. After a rocket that he sent into space crashes back to Earth, Quatermass and unofficial partner-in-crime Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner) uncover a bizarre alien conspiracy in which a surviving astronauts&apos;s body has been &quot;borrowed&quot; by extraterrestrials keen on relocating.\n\nDirector Guest gives the drama a no-nonsense, almost documentary feel. The special effects are perfectly acceptable for the period and the brooding sense of mid-century paranoia is well conveyed.\n\nThe hero is the script, though. The dialogue is fresh and colourful and writers Guest and Neale always keep the scientific jargon interesting. All the characters are believable and the performances are top notch.\n\nDespite the fact that James Bernard&apos;s solid score is a little overbearing at times, this is a dashingly good science fiction film with a strong stench of horror.",

      "reviewBody": "Pretty interesting war film despite the well-grooved plot involving an experienced sergeant leading a squad of young, inexperienced infantry soldiers into battle. Presumably set in Italy (some combat sequences were lifted from the Audie Murphy flick &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;) the story centers upon the relationship that develops between the squad leader, Cooley (James Dury) and one of his charges, Hacker (played by Steve Carlson).\n\nSquare-jawed and rugged, Drury was born for his role. Best known for the TV western &quot;The Virginian,&quot; it&apos;s a shame Drury wasn&apos;t in more combat films. Carlson is fine as a surly private but he is overshadowed by the wise-cracking (and sometimes irritating) Jon Daly who plays the unit comedian.\n\nNorman Fell has a tiny role in this film and a young Robert Pine is interesting as sensitive trooper. Look closely for Kent &quot;Adam 12&quot; McCord (billed under his real name, Kent McWhirter) who pops up here and there as a lieutenant. It might have been more interesting to cast McCord in the role of Hacker."

Having said that, I have to admit that while, yes, it was amusing, it was very much of a one-note idea that was stretched very thin. Dunne, as always, was at the top of her form and her talents in all departments were very much on display. What did let the movie down was a weak script and an irritatingly hammy performance by the usually reliable Melvyn Douglas. One only has to look at Ninotchka to see how good he can be when his comedy acting has a serious side to it. His character in Theodora Goes Wild was just too silly to be believable. The smalltown sequences were charming in their way but after a while became tedious with repetition. Thomas Mitchell&apos;s scenes (as editor of the local newspaper) were rip-roaring first class, which made one want for more. Would I recommend this movie? Yes, if you&apos;re a fan of Irene Dunne&apos;s and want to watch her comedic talents at work. Several postings on this site have recommended The Awful Truth as a must-see. Well, yes, if you&apos;re a Dunne fan but here again there are moments when the script sags and both Dunne and Cary Grant, both consummate professionals, are skating on very thin ice, pulling the movie onward through sheer force of personality. If you really want to see Irene Dunne at her very, very best then you should catch her in the much better written My Favorite Wife, or Love Affair, both infinitely superior to their later remakes. In these two movies her talents REALLY soar!",

Although entirely filmed in a studio, the production is a very funny and entertaining adaptation that creates a Shakespearean atmosphere by using contemporary costumes and set decoration. This colourful scenery is the perfect background for the actors, who are giving very good performances, above all Rolf Ludwig, who is able to portray Benedict&apos;s development from the mocking bachelor to the loving husband convincingly. Although I generally prefer Kenneth Branagh&apos;s adaptation of the play, this film tops it in some parts: for example, the scenes with the stupid men of the guard are far better and funnier here than in the 1992 version. All in all, I strongly recommend this film because it makes you feel as if you were watching a very good stage production. I&apos;m sure that Shakespeare would have liked it."

      "reviewBody": "I am far from an expert on Indian cinema. While I&apos;ve seen a few hundred Indian films, each year they bring out more films than Hollywood...times three! And, there are many in India who have seen thousands of these movies. But with my experience, I can say that the style and production values of Indian films from the early 1990s and before are VERY different from newer Indian pictures. In recent decades, Indian films have improved considerably when it comes to techniques and production values. And, as a result, often their films are the equal or better to many American movies.\n\nI say all this because if you aren&apos;t familiar with Indian films, you might be surprised by how cheap &quot;Saajan&quot; looks compared to later Indian movies. I am NOT saying it&apos;s a bad film but so much of it looks cheap because Indian cinema still had some catching up to do at this point. The singing, compared to later films, sounds cheap and canned. Also, edits and acting are not quite as well done as you&apos;d see today. The same can be said for the opening and closing credits...they look far cheaper than newer Indian films. BUT, this is NOT to say &quot;Saajan&quot; is a bad film...just made in an older style.\n\nThe story begins at a Catholic orphanage. Aman is a sad boy because other kids are adopted but because he has a very bad limp, he assumes he&apos;ll never be. But when he meets Akash and is befriended by him, soon they become best of friends. And, when Akash&apos;s parents meet Aman, they grow to love him as well and adopt the boy. This portion of the film is my favorite, as it&apos;s very sweet and heartwarming.\n\nYears pass and now the two brothers are adults. Aman is bookish and serious and spends much of his time writing poetry. Akash is very different and is rarely serious and spends his time chasing women...lots and lots of women!\n\nOne day Akash meets a different sort of woman...one who isn&apos;t immediately impressed by his smile and playboy lifestyle. So, in desperation, he asks his brother to help him win the lady&apos;s heart through his poems...poems to which Akash signs his name!\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it&apos;s basically the plot to &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;...the French tale. However, will it end in tragedy like the life of Cyrano or will it have a happier ending?\n\nIf you look past the cheaper look to the film, you will see a lot to like. Sanjay Dutt is wonderful as Akash...actually outshining the arguably more famous Salman Khan as Akash. The story also has some wonderful moments. As for the music, I personally could not enjoy the tunes as much as in later films because of the cheap tinny sound...which took me out of the moment. The choreography during some of these songs also was occasionally bizarre and not as glossy as later films. In particular, the lady hanging off the hood of Akash&apos;s car as she writhed and sang...that was pretty weird. Overall, a very good film...worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Alain Resnais was part of the so-called Left Bank of the French New Wave, alongside with Varda, Marker and Demy, who were politically much more aware compared to the film fanatics of Cahiers du Cinema (Rohmer, Truffaut, Rivette, Godard, Chabrol). Alain Resnais has always been interested in past but here he focuses on its impact with regards to the future. The War Is Over was his fourth feature, following Hiroshima mon amour, Last Year in Marienbad and Muriel, and still remains as one of the finest films of political cinema. The film builds around the theme of how to come to terms with one&apos;s past in order to live in peace with the present. No other place -- maybe Germany or Poland -- offers such a great setting for this but Spain because the shadows of the Civil War are so present. It is a milieu that has become the symbol of the war, so to speak.\n\nDiego Mora (Yves Montad) is an old man who spent his youth as a revolutionary in the Spanish Civil War. Now, thirty years later, he&apos;s part of a group that wants to redeem the dreams of the revolution in Paris. All the members of the group are living in the past, and so is Diego. But soon he has a moment of realization and breaks himself away from the chains of illusion and decides to make a change. Thus, The War Is Over is really a story about a man who is living a lie. It tells, rather bleakly in a melancholy tone, about old communists who can&apos;t let go off the past.\n\nThe War Is Over might just be Resnais&apos; most satisfying work when it comes to somewhat coherent viewing experience. It&apos;s his first film with a clear storyline which is relatively easy to follow even if the editing was deliberately (but not self-deliberate!) ambiguous and confusing. Resnais has succeeded perfectly to relay the flow of time. Moreover, through the character played by Yves Montand the viewer can understand the director&apos;s thoughts and emotions, no matter how shattered, because he holds the pieces together. It is he through whom the viewer constructs the big picture.\n\nIn The War Is Over memories are created for the future. Alain Resnais doesn&apos;t try to build the horrors of the past by newsreel footage. He relays the tragedy of the conditions by showing how people are still living in the past, how they are left with unredeemed dreams in their hands. The dream has died in Spain. Of course, Spain is still there but merely as a concrete place full of tourists. People don&apos;t understand each other. There is a major breakdown in the communication between the old and the new left. Both are dreaming of a revolution but in their own ways. The legacy of the past torments the protagonist. However, he is not only forced to recall the past endlessly but also to be unable to understand the present reality.",

      "reviewBody": "This is distinguishably different from the general Hollywood films or independent projects. It&apos;s not like anything done before. LARS VON TRIER, and BJORK, simply blow your mind away: such totality in delivery!\n\nIt&apos;s gut wrenching - an absorbing tearjerker - but not sentimental. It is in strong doses. (NFE: it may not be for everyone.) The theatre audience was very quiet with occasional sniffing heard. The film may be a fantasy, yet there are subtle jabs at certain social norms and contains hints at how we treat life and lead life.\n\nBjork made it natural, innocent, and naively good. It is all Bjork matter: she is feeling all the joy and pain and daydreaming, saying all those words, singing all those songs, and dancing along to the music she so ingeniously composed. Lars von Trier once again wrote and delivered a 100% powerful film. He packs all kinds of emotions into 2 hrs. and 20 mins.: from the endearing friendship of two working women Kathy and Selma; to the faithful loving pursuit of Jeff for Selma; to the quiet exchanges of seemingly trusting souls of Bill and Selma; to Selma&apos;s son, Bill&apos;s wife, the crime, the court, the prison&apos;s loneliness within; the anguish pain of a determined mother; and the integrated mood changing musical numbers in-between. One scene of Bjork lying motionless with just one finger moving with quiet sobbing heard is powerful imagery.\n\nCatherine Deneuve as Kathy is well at ease in her supporting role. She continues to exude her charm quietly. You can tell she thoroughly enjoys the company she&apos;s in at this production. Musical-wise, Deneuve is no stranger: besides &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; 1964 - every word in the film was sung, I also remember Jacques Demy&apos;s &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; 1967 - she danced and sang with her sister Francoise Dorleac, along with Gene Kelly, Michel Piccoli and George Chakiris.\n\nDavid Morse as Bill (the policeman and neighbor) reminds me of what a memorable performance he delivered in Sean Penn&apos;s &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; 1995 opposite Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright. &apos;tis great to see Joel Grey dancing again (hm, in the most improbable setting!)\n\nFor a 5&apos; 4&apos;&apos; singer-songwriter from Iceland, Bjork is a giant impact in this quiet powerhouse of a film, &quot;Dancer In the Dark.&quot; Lars von Trier&apos;s vision and confidence in Bjork truly paid off!",

      "reviewBody": "A Russian baron evades the violent SCARLET DAWN of the Revolution by escaping Moscow with his faithful serving maid.\n\nHere is an excellent little film, from Warner Bros. and director William Dieterle, full of excitement, drama and pre-Code libidinousness. The production values--sets, costumes, score--are all first rate and the acting is of a high quality. The picture&apos;s only major drawback is its too-brief conclusion, perhaps necessitated by its short overall running time of under an hour, but this does not explain why the film should be so unjustly obscure today. It is a small gem awaiting discovery by viewers appreciative of quality cinema.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr is properly dashing as the young nobleman whose life is suddenly tilted upside down by the political upheaval. The actor revels in giving a full-bodied portrayal, presenting a character both wantonly licentious and daringly brave. The sequence in which he dashes into the streets of Constantinople in search of Christian witnesses to his impromptu wedding is delightful in its unexpected sense of frolic &amp; fun. Fairbanks is ably matched by Nancy Carroll, deftly underplaying her role as his adoring servant. The sweetness of her character&apos;s simple nature shines through, as well as a steely resolve, as she endures dangers and hardships to be with the man she loves.\n\nLovely Lilyan Tashman, in one of her final roles before her early death, plays the scheming Russian courtesan who hopes to use Fairbanks as her ticket to the good life in Paris. Guy Kibbee, a very popular character actor at Warner&apos;s, appears for only a few moments at the end of the movie as a wealthy American visiting the Levant.\n\nMovie mavens will recognize Mischa Auer as a Russian cavalry officer; beefy Dewey Robinson as a Bolshevik thug; nervous Frank Reicher as a duplicitous pawnbroker; as well as Mae Busch &amp; Lee Kohlmar as the wedding witnesses--all uncredited.",

I prefer movies that show action and not personifications and individual proceedings like they wanted to show in Star Trek. But there they only stole from Babylon 5, which is the only Sci-Fi series in my opinion. However Wing Commander is a movie that brings you back to your youth and for the first time a computer game was well put on the big screen."

Go to the parson&apos;s house to borrow his wig! When the IG shows up, he has Jannings conduct court; the case involves a jug supposedly broken by the lady&apos;s daughter&apos;s fiancee, but matters are darker than that, and as the case proceeds its erratic way, it becomes clear to the audience that the bumbling judge is in it up to his perrukeless, battered skull.\n\nA decade earlier, Jannings had been acclaimed the world over for his movie roles; sound may have driven him back to Germany, but he is wonderful as the bumbling nitwit judge in this movie adapted from a comedy by Heinrich von Kleist. Jannings co-directs with Gustave Ucicky, and for what is basically a one-set play, it&apos;s opened up marvelously with a camera nicely handled by Fritz Arno Wagner. All of which is unnecessary; the opening is a perfect silent comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;We&apos;re going to see this through to the bitter end. Or... lager end.&quot; Gary King (Simon Pegg)\n\nSimon Pegg and Edgar Wright are at it again satirizing pop culture, this time with an entertaining send up of zombie movies (even their own spoof, Shaun of the Dead) and boy-man buddy vacations like Hangover. Five middle-aged blokes, led by the perennially immature Gary King (still the &quot;King,&quot; he&apos;d like to think), return after 20 years to their hometown to finish the crawl to the 12th and final pub, The World&apos;s End.\n\nThe obvious allegory is fun to follow as robotic replicas of actual humans try to take over the world. Their mission is to make earth and humans perfect, a goal any lame brain knows is impossible. Aliens have been trying to conquer earth since movies began with little success given our need for independence and ingenuity finding the alien weaknesses.\n\nThe real strength of The World&apos;s End is in the dialogue with its rapid repartee. For example:\n\nGary King: And here we go! Just like the five musketeers. Steven Prince: Three musketeers wasn&apos;t it? Gary King: Well nobody knows how many there were really do they? Oliver: You do know that The Three Musketeers was a fiction right, written by Alexander Dumas. Gary King: A lot of people are saying that about the bible these days. Steven Prince: What, that it was written by Alexander Dumas. Gary King: Don&apos;t be daft, Steve; it was written by Jesus.\n\nCovering authorship and ignorance issues while being amusingly clueless is the endearment of Pegg and Wright&apos;s democratic humor—after all, none of the players is exempt from stupidity.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, however, is the thematic point about never being able to go home again. The protagonists grew up in the same town, and returning to finish their crawl reveals that no one remembers them! Of course, since the townies are almost all robots, they couldn&apos;t remember them anyway. Yet the point is figuratively well taken: Nobody cares about you after you&apos;re gone."

Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is &quot;Presented in Shaw Scope&quot;, just like the good old days.\n\nThis film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.\n\nAct One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can&apos;t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.\n\nAct Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi&apos;s style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.\n\nAct Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don&apos;t make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday, so, if you&apos;re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?",

      "reviewBody": "Just finished watching Thale and found myself more than impressed. Made on a shoe string budget by rising Norwegian director Aleksander Nordaas, the film explores the huldra a mythical being from Nordic folklore. Without giving anything away I will just say that the acting, especially that of the very beautiful Silje Reinåmo in the title role, was excellent for such a low budget picture. The CGI and cinematography in the movie also impressed offering another breathtaking view of the Norwegian countryside. The film is let down slightly by some holes in the storyline and ultimately by the ending which I found could have been done so much better. This said Thale is an excellent example of what an imaginative director can fulfill within the confines of a small budget.",

      "reviewBody": "In post civil war America the President, (Van Johnson), travels to Dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessman interested in installing the vice President whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents. A gunman (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to uncover the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating, if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the Kennedy assassination. The film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy&apos;s death was the result of a coup de tat- which many Americans could not accept at the time. Oswald&apos;s murder is replayed here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible, on route to Fort Worth prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald&apos;s death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene. Nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns. Worth a look!",

      "reviewBody": "Read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com This classic film noir has very few of techniques generally associated with noir. It contains no skewed camera angles; and though it is darkly lit, it is not overcome with murky, obscuring shadows. The hero is not down-and-out, poor, or desperate. There is no retrospective narration, or flashbacks. Yet, the Big Sleep is widely considered to be one of the very best of this genre. It is a cynical, perverse, murderous world filled with loads of confusing action and unknown motives. It is, in fact, one of the great films of one of the screens greatest actors (for my personal top 10 actors list, click here), and most talented directors.\n\nIt was directed by Howard Hawks fresh off of the successful pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall in To Have and Have Not. The two star here again and it is easy to see why they made another two films together. Based on a Raymond Chandler novel of the same name, many people complain that this film is incomprehensible. Somewhat famously it is reported that Bogart and Hawks, after arguing over who killed one of the characters, called up Chandler to get the correct answer. Chandler didn&apos;t have the slightest idea, for the novel is rather vague on this point. It&apos;s true that both the novel and film leave many plot points as to who did what to whom more than unclear, but there is so much style in both that it&apos;s hard to make a convincing argument against them.\n\nA good deal of the confusion within the film comes from the production codes in effect at the time it was produced. Chandler&apos;s novel deals with murder, homosexuality, heterosexuality, and pornography. At the time, these things were deemed unfit to show on a movie screen and so Hawks had to hint at them using various subtle methods. For instance, when Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) is found by detective Phillip Marlow (Bogart) in the novel she is completely nude and sitting posed for a hidden camera. Since pornography is explicitly against code, in the movie she is dressed in a silky, Japanese gown. There is still a hidden camera, and its missing film becomes a catalyst for much of the action in the film. We must infer from the exotic nature of the gown that there was more than just pictures of a woman in a gown going on. There are many similar instances in the film like this. For an audience member who has not read the book, they must pay close attention to the subtext, or the film will seem baffling.\n\nPersonally, I am very much a fan of the book, and all of Chandler&apos;s work. While I appreciate that some of the finer plot points are a bit vague in this film, I also understand that the film succeeds not in the details of the story, but in a sinister sense of style. The film oozes with a dark, disquieting atmosphere. Nearly everyone Marlowe meets is hiding something, and is of less than upstanding moral character. Hawks does a great job of keeping nearly every scene in the dark or in the rain, or both. There are so many characters coming in and out of the shadows and with their own shady character that it is difficult to keep up.\n\nBogart, of course, does a marvelous job as Marlowe. He seems to understand a lot more information than the audience is ever given. Chandler wrote Marlowe as a detective who sticks by his own set up morals, remaining somewhat of a noble creature trying to stay afloat amongst the muck and sewers of the city. Lauren Bacall does a very good job portraying Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, in a role that is much different than the one in the book. Like many films from this era, they create a romance that wasn&apos;t really in the source material. I don&apos;t mind though, because Bogart and Bacall really sizzle.\n\nWhat can I say that hasn&apos;t been said before? This is really classic noir at its best. It&apos;s got Bogart and Bacall. It was directed by Howard Hawks, written by William Faulkner from a novel by Raymond Chandler. What more could a lover of classic cinema want? More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com",

I consider myself pretty scare proof as I&apos;m a massive fan of psychological horror but i just caught Repulsion on TV tonight at 1.40am alone, in the dark. As i write its now 6am as all i can think about is this film.\n\nI have never been affected by a film as much this before. Whilst some may consider the first part rather slow i found its a wonderful set-up for what follows. I wont review it as many others already have but all i wanted to say is that this film truly haunted me, genuinely made me jump and kept me tense as hell!.....i cant put it into words\n\nThe cinematography is amazing, much better than anything current. The lead actress is astonishing to say the least and unlike other films, this film is truly disturbing. I advise watching alone, in total peace, in the dark.\n\nI can see where lynch got many of his ideas but this is far superior.The last shot is pure genius and very unsettling.\n\nI can honestly say this is now my favourite film of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "NAVRANG is a romantic musical set during the middle of 19th century British ruled India. The film is a fairly decent romance tale of longing, separation and eventual reunion, but what sets it apart is that the couple here are married to each other rather than your usual couple during the courtship process, that&apos;s found generally in such films. Its timeless musical album and the superb dance performances by the Sandhya is certainly the reason it&apos;s remembered most, but many people fail to appreciate the brilliance of Mahipal&apos;s performance, and the masterful set designing.\n\nIf Jamuna&apos;s character was given as much care as Divakar&apos;s, the film could have soared even higher. To be frank, Jamuna feels one-note mostly due to her poor writing, and is a character that you fail to root for, despite the fact that she too suffers a lot. But the way she treats Divakar, and the manner in which her character progresses during the 3rd act, definitely makes her the primary antagonist of this film.\n\nAlso, why was the entire film a flashback? The current timeline of events in the film serve no purpose at all, and if its entirety removed from the film, it still won&apos;t make an iota of difference.\n\nOverall, Navrang is a classic romantic tale with a dose of patriotism on the side, and apart from some hiccups here and there, it&apos;s a fairly smooth rowing.",

      "reviewBody": "Legend has it that Spencer Tracy said he would cut Katharine Hepburn down to size when upon meeting her in heels for the first time on the set of Woman of the Year.\n\nI think that&apos;s what the authors of the screenplay Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner, Jr., had in mind in the script as well. As mismatched a pair if there ever were, he a down to earth sports columnist and she a world famous news reporter and commentator, fall in love. \n\nAs her celebrity is much wider known than his, Hepburn expects to have it all her own way. The rest of the film is concerned with their efforts to adjust to each other.\n\nKatharine Hepburn&apos;s character is based on liberal radio commentator and reporter Dorothy Thompson. Not surprising that no one has mentioned that yet in all the reviews so far. The giveaway is Tracy first hearing her voice on the radio while in his favorite sports bar on Information Please where Thompson was a guest. Her career petered out after World War II, so she&apos;s not known to today&apos;s audience.\n\nWriters Kanin and Lardner had as a model for the Tracy character Lardner&apos;s own father. Ring Lardner was one the celebrated sports writers of the first half of the 20th century, a great reporter and humorist. While Tracy is not as witty as Ring Lardner, he is definitely as down to earth.\n\nMy favorite scene is Spencer Tracy trying to feel comfortable at an international gathering at her place, looking even for people who speak English. Of course she&apos;s equally as uncomfortable at William Bendix&apos;s bar where Tracy likes to hang out. \n\nHepburn, comfortable in her celebrity, just sails through life, getting awards here and there. When she thinks of a Greek orphan kid she gets pressured into taking in as another award, that&apos;s when Tracy puts his foot down.\n\nBased on some real celebrities, Tracy and Hepburn become those celebrities in the flesh. It&apos;s an awesome debut for what turned out to be a great screen team.\n\nLook for fine performances by William Bendix, Fay Bainter, Minor Watson and Dan Tobin. Kanin and Lardner copped the film&apos;s only Oscar for an original screenplay. Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Greer Garson in Mrs. Miniver.\n\nIf Woman of the Year were remade today, the producers might consider making the woman the sports reporter. Seeing Jeannie Zelasko covering the World Series this year, I&apos;m sure it would work very well.",

Three, maybe four characters with self- effacing directing and camera work, it was as intimate as small off-Broadway theatre. I&apos;ve seen nothing since as cinematic, or moving.

Perhaps it only really shares it&apos;s loose relation to historical facts. But where Forman drives home Shaffer&apos;s story with absolute confidence and dramatic certainty, Avati threads gently around the historic persona and in reality makes a film about childhood in general rather than Mozart in particular. The focus of the story is that last summer, those last few weeks of childhood. Avati tells his story as Mozart is fourteen years old spending time at Count Pallavicini&apos;s summer estate outside Bologna, before an important exam at the Philharmonic Academy. Mozart (Cristopher Davidson) is more taken by the subtle mysteries of the estate, the wonder of the surrounding woods and a friendship with the count&apos;s son Guiseppe (Dario Parisini). Perhaps it is not so much the woods in themselves as what they represent as they stand between the estate where Mozart studies and the house of the beautiful Antonia (Barbara Rebeschini), the young girl destined to marry Guiseppe. The young trio (the &quot;three of us&quot; of the title), form a loving friendship experiencing the awakening of adolescence together. Emotive as the subject matter is there are no big gestures in the film, the trio explores each other and their surroundings and find new emotions of love and camaraderie on the threshold of forming their own persona&apos;s in a place and time where the grown up world is both near and far at the same time. Avati&apos;s story and direction threats the subject with tenderness and elegance, employing lush 18th century milieu&apos;s, atmospheric ochre color schemed cinematography and lovingly pastiche Mozart music by Ritz Ortolani. In all this Avanti strays from overstating events, giving the story an equal sense of honest realism and lingering mystery. This is not a film about an exceptional, singular genius, but a film about a young boy.",

      "name": "2 x Belomondo, 1 (and only) Raquel Welch",
      "reviewBody": "&apos;L&apos;animal&apos;, made in 1977, is a film shrouded in stardust. The director is Claude Zidi, one of the most famous French authors of popular comedies, who is also the co-author of the screenplay whose dialogues are written by the legendary Michel Audiard. The music is composed by Vladimir Cosma and the cast includes famous actors and a director in cameo roles. The main attraction, however, was the presence in the main roles of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Raquel Welch. This was then, and is still today, the main reason why it is worth watching or re-watching &apos;L&apos;animal&apos;.\n\nWe are dealing with a film about people who make films, proof that not only in Hollywood are filmmakers in love and fascinated by their own profession. Mike and Jane are a pair of stunt doubles for Johnny Hallyday and Jane Birkin in a film by Claude Chabrol. They are scheduled to be married at noon, which leaves them enough time for a car stunt at 10AM. The car&apos;s brakes fail and the day ends in the hospital, with the two in casts and bandages. Jane, furious, says NO to the mayor brought to the hospital to officiate the marriage. A few months later, Jane has found a wealthy aristocrat who would like to marry her while Mike has not given up on persuading Jane to marry him, but in the absence of work he is forced to defraud welfare by claiming that has seven children (or maybe nine) and to dress up as a gorilla for supermarket adverts. The two&apos;s chance comes when their services are requested for a film starring Bruno Ferrari, a star who claims to perform his own stunts. In reality, not only does he suffer from vertigo, but he&apos;s also gay. The troubles only start here.\n\nBelmondo&apos;s admirers cannot miss the opportunity to see their idol again in a sparkling double role, with a fearful and gay actor as one of the appearances. Raquel Welch is brilliantly sexy and very likable. The two carry the film, which otherwise has a rather banal plot, in which the biggest surprise is that there are no surprises. However, there is one more important aspect that cannot be omitted. Unlike the film&apos;s hero, Belmondo actually was performing most of his stunts himself, and he did so in &apos;L&apos;animal&apos;, in which he fulfilled one of his childhood dreams - making a scene where he stands on the wings of an airplane in flight. No insurance company agreed to insure him for this scene. He did it at his own peril, and we have it captured as it happened on film. Another reason not to bypass it.",

      "reviewBody": "Brian dePalma really accomplished quite a feat by paying homage to Hitchcock with a strong variation on VERTIGO&apos;s theme--a man who loses the woman he loves sees her reincarnated in another woman and then loses her too.\n\nHe takes this premise and does some fancy camera-work that swirls around the lovers with an intensity only matched by the whirling colors of Bernard Herrmann&apos;s magical score. He sets up the tale by having a convincing kidnapping take place in which his wife and daughter are taken by the criminals and has him mourning their loss until he encounters another woman in Italy, years later, who strongly resembles his presumably dead wife.\n\nThe rest of the plot must remain undisclosed for &quot;spoiler&quot; purposes, but I&apos;m sure there are those who will at least have a suspicion as to the real purpose of all the foregoing events.\n\nCLIFF ROBERTSON has the difficult chore of appearing downtrodden and depressed most of the time, so GENEVIEVE BUJOLD has the task of brightening up the tale with her unconventional good looks and upbeat manner. JOHN LITHGOW makes his screen debut as Robertson&apos;s close friend and business acquaintance.\n\nIf it&apos;s a stylish dePalma movie you&apos;re in the mood for, this one will fill the bill nicely. And that Bernard Herrmann score alone makes watching the movie completely worthwhile. It&apos;s dazzling.",

      "reviewBody": "Is &apos;Species&apos; a groundbreaking, visionary SF movie? No, of course not. Is it silly, trashy, but FUN b-grade exploitation SF in the tradition of Tobe Hooper&apos;s &apos;Lifeforce&apos;? You bet! It isn&apos;t quite as entertaining as &apos;Lifeforce&apos;, the original naked space chick movie, but it&apos;s a still pretty good way to waste an hour and a half of your life. Why it gets slammed so much is beyond me. Maybe people just don&apos;t have a sense of humour. The opening of the movie is terrific. In a lab we see a cold scientist (Ben Kingsley) overseeing the murder of a young girl (Michelle Williams), imprisoned in a glass case. Only she escapes by showing some super human strength. She is immediately pursued by dozens of soldiers, but manages to elude them. We then learn she is in fact a genetic experiment, a mixing of extraterrestrial and human DNA. Kingsley heads up a task force consisting of Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Marg Helgenberger and Forest Whitaker, each a specialist in a different field. Pretty soon our alien fugitive mutates into a gorgeous blonde (Natasha Henstridge), who spends most of her time topless. Kingsley and company face a race against time, they must capture the horny alien girl before she screws guys to death(?) or something... Who knows. Henstridge is great to look at and the above average cast give it their best shot with the lame dialogue and cliched scenes. Whitaker&apos;s empath character quickly irritates with his constant stating the bleedin&apos; obvious, but I always get a kick out of watching Madsen, here in stereotypical tough guy mode. &apos;Species&apos; is big dumb fun."

With this one I slipped up, mostly because it comes disguised as a dark romantic comedy. It is funny and quirky, disgusting and disturbing in equal measure.\n\nMixing genres is both fun and innovative, as long as one simply rule is followed: it must be cohesive. The viewer can go from laughing one minute to crying the next (see Futurama episode &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot;), but not if the change comes out of nowhere. In Must Love Death the change from comedy to horror is incredibly jarring and it took me, for one, out of the moment.\n\nComedy and horror usually go together like peanut and chocolate, but in this film it just left a sloppy mess. I adore dark comedy, but the element of torture porn just made the laughter stop. I can imagine torture porn fans would be equally disappointed, because half the film really is devoted to a dark romantic comedy. This film could have worked. At first I wanted it to work, but beyond the halfway point I just started wanting it to end instead.",

Now I have read some other comments about this movie that say it is an accurate portrayal of teenage life. Honestly who has ever thought to them self that someone was pouring their tangible soul into the air. This movie was filled with ridiculous metaphors that were side splitting good fun. It was a pseudo intellectual blowout. The dialogue was unrealistic rambling done so seriously that I couldn&apos;t believe what I was hearing. Its directing was so bland and unoriginal that it gave me a headache. I recommend this movie to the misanthropes and debasers of the world who love to see failure."

      "reviewBody": "Being a fan of Pinoy horror films, this was the film that I was most looking forward to seeing in this year&apos;s Metro Manila Film Festival. The fact that it earned an A rating from the Film Ratings Board was the added push I needed to clear up some time from the busy holiday schedule to go see it. Maybe because of all of this heightened sense of expectation, I came out of the movie house today terribly disappointed.\n\nI am getting ahead of myself. &quot;Segunda Mano&quot; is about a sad antique- shop owner Mabel (Kris Aquino) who lives with her mother (Ms. Helen Gamboa) in a spooky old house. Both are still disturbed by the death of younger sister Marie in a freak beach accident twenty years ago. She meets Ivan (Dingdong Dantes), a wealthy architect who seemed to have it all on the surface. Why then does a spirit inhabiting the bag and dress of Ivan&apos;s estranged wife Marielle (Angelica Panganiban) seem to stop at nothing to scare Mabel away, as people around them get killed?\n\nEverything else in this movie is a horror cliché -- computer-generated spirits appearing on and off screen, séance scenes, comfort room stalls scenes, jumpy &quot;scare&quot; music, swimming pool scenes, cats, blackouts, all the way up to very last &quot;shock&quot; ending! The acting of the actors already telegraphed how everything was going to end, so there was practically no surprises. Kris looked very much older than Dingdong, and hardly his type based on his lifestyle, so they lack any sort of chemistry. Bangs Garcia was funny, but her ditzy character&apos;s &quot;friendship&quot; with Kris&apos; morose character was so unlikely and felt forced and unrealistic. Trying to meld the stories of the unrelated deaths of Marie and Marielle was unnecessary and confusing.\n\nThe main and probably the only good thing I can say about &quot;Segunda Mano&quot; is their idea that ghosts can inhabit used merchandise we may buy from a second-hand store. That idea is actually horror genius! However unfortunately, the originality begins and ends there. After a truly good Pinoy horror film like &quot;The Road&quot; earlier this month, I expected this film to also be that level. Unfortunately, this was such a letdown. &quot;Segunda Mano&quot; is so chock-full of previously-done scare tactics such that this entire film also feels &quot;second-hand&quot;.",

From the first to last this movie is a kaleidoscope of images, created to mesmerize the mind. Director Andras Jeles uses child actors to weave a visual tapestry of Godly virtues and human weakness intertwine with historical events. Somewhere between the Creation of Man and his Redemption, the viewer is set adrift in a sea of spectral images, who&apos; purpose is known only to the director or to Pablo Picasso. Despite some provocative moments such as baring all with a nude Adam and Eve, the collage of words and historical settings the film overwhelm the viewer and destroys what little message the director intended to impart. From a Western point of view this film is far too complicated to be easily absorbed and thus fails to be recognized as anything but an art form gone mad.",

      "name": "mostly McNamara, but just enough Morris to make it a masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "People who watch Errol Morris&apos; Fog of War will be left with a lot to think about. There are a number of parallels to be drawn between what Americans faced during the Vietnam War era and what Americans face now with middle-east conflicts. Morris has directed several controversial documentaries, but Fog of War is very different. He allows the subject of the documentary, Robert McNamara, to remain the focus of the film from beginning to end. Fog of War is very stylish but the artistic features don&apos;t take away from the social and political commentary. Instead, they add to it and make the film more enjoyable. This is an important film and while McNamara deserves most the credit for its success, Morris presented the content of this film in a way that made it both provocative and entertaining.\n\nWhen Morris had an opportunity to interview Robert McNamara, he had no idea what was about to happen. Morris was making a film about Vietnam, not McNamara specifically. However, what was intended to be a 20 minute interview turned into a several hour candid conversation. This interview turned conversation became the backbone of Fog of War. It is obvious that something like guilt has been bugging McNamara and for whatever reason, Morris brought it out. \n\nAs a former secretary of defense for John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson, McNamara was one of the most important figures from the Vietnam War, in charge of things like bombing campaigns and overall military strategy. Before that, McNamara was a brain behind figuring out how to kill lots of people in World War II. At one point, McNamara says directly to the camera, &apos;we were behaving as war criminals. What makes it moral if you win but immoral if you lose?&apos; He&apos;s making a point about the way the U.S. and allied forces bombed the hell out of Japan, sending hundreds of thousands to fiery graves, mostly civilians. \n\nMorris uses what he calls the &apos;Interrotron&apos;, a device which allows the subject, here it&apos;s McNamara, to look directly into the camera and see the interviewer, here that&apos;s Morris. To the audience, it seems like McNamara is looking right at us, which makes it seem even more confessional than it already is. At certain times in Fog of War, McNamara seems so happy that he has an opportunity to talk about his experiences, but at other times, he seems like he&apos;s so defensive about his reputation. All of that seems to have something to do with the way Errol Morris asks questions. Morris is friendly but asks pointed questions that McNamara has a tough time avoiding.\n\nProbably the most important moment of Fog of War is when McNamara talks about mankind and its inability to learn from history. He seems very pessimistic but has moments where he seems to think people can learn from the past. It&apos;s easy to think about Donald Rumsfeld and wonder what sort of conversations he might have with McNamara. Another great moment in Fog of War is when McNamara gets to meet a general from the Vietnamese army, one of McNamara&apos;s adversaries from 30 years ago. It&apos;s then where we see that McNamara still doesn&apos;t accept much responsibility for what he did during the Vietnam War. He thinks of himself as just being an employee working for the president. \n\nFog of War makes people think about a lot, but that&apos;s because of Robert McNamara more than Errol Morris. This was McNamara&apos;s film and Morris just happened to hold the camera in place when he probably felt like cringing or even laughing at times. During his famous acceptance speech for Fog of War, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary, Morris reminded the worldwide audience to be careful, because the United States seems to be making the same mistakes it made during the Vietnam War. That&apos;s up to the audience to decide, but Fog of War definitely makes everybody think about that."

The intensity of the writing, especially in the first half, where we, the viewers, are given a bird&apos;s eye view of how and what this central character thinks is what makes Subharathri (Good Night) a pleasant and soothing art to consume. I can&apos;t contain the merriment I felt when I was watching it with my family. It&apos;s a startling film, one that sneaks up on you and refuses to budge. Writer-director Vyasan KP is surely a guy we should watch out for for this drama couldn&apos;t have been better. But if I could mention why I zapped four stars, it has to be due to the poor marriage between the halves, one where Dileep&apos;s character enters like a sore thumb. TN.",

The expected gore is also well done - just enough to keep you clutching at the arm rests! You can really tell that the writer/director is an avid fan of the genre, and that is what makes it great for the rest of us as well. \n\nMore importantly, it gives the queer audiences something of our own to relate to, after years of watching &quot;Jamie Lee Curtis&quot; et-al running from the likes of Jason, Freddy and Mike Myers. All I can say is it&apos;s about time!"

      "reviewBody": "THE BICYCLE THIEVES is an Italian &quot;Neo-realist&quot; film--so called because it used real people in rather ordinary situations. Some see these as anti-Hollywood but the actual reason for them was that after the war, the Italian film industry was in ruin and they were practically broke, so making these simple films about simple people was a natural outgrowth, though some of the groundwork for this style began during the war.\n\nThe story itself is about a poor man who is out of work but is finally able to secure a job using his bicycle. The problem is that soon after starting back to work, the bike is stolen so he spends the rest of the film searching for the bike (sort of like PEEWEE&apos;S GREAT ADVENTURE, but not a comedy). Later in the film, the focus is not just on the bike but on the relationship between the man and his young son. There really is nothing more to this very simple plot, but it is a fascinating time capsule into the desperate state of Italy until its rebirth in the mid-1950s.\n\nThe fact that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is so well known and respected is a testament to the fact that many &quot;in the know&quot; aren&apos;t really that smart after all. What they actually didn&apos;t realize is that the director (DeSica) did several other films that were at least as good, if not better. I have heard and read much fawning praise for this film while at the same time wondering how these critics can discuss THE BICYCLE THIEVES without mentioning his other great works. It wasn&apos;t like THE BICYCLE THIEVES was his one crowning achievement as director--it&apos;s just that this one was discovered abroad and by the Oscar people (AMPAS). I challenge you to watch MIRACLE IN MILAN, UMBERTO D or especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US and then tell me that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is THE great masterpiece. These films (particularly THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US) have a great depth of emotion that THE BICYCLE THIEVES lacks and the connection to the audience is greater (provided you ever see these other films).\n\nI am not cursing THE BICYCLE THIEVES--it is a very good and simple film. But as far as its being a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, I just think it&apos;s a bit overrated. Before marking this review &quot;not helpful&quot;, please first have integrity and see these other films to see what I mean--they are indeed great films and DeSica was an amazing director.",

It&apos;s pretty dark on the surface and full of gore, but also has completely ridiculous moments which make it a parody of itself.

The film inspired me to look beyond the surface and recognize that every person I encounter is on their own unique journey, carrying their own set of experiences, pains, and joys. I now see each person as a mirror reflecting aspects of myself and the larger human experience. It also brought me a newfound sense of peace and contentment with who I am. It encouraged me to love myself fully, to embrace my flaws, and to see them not as failures but as stepping stones on the path of growth. I feel more connected to everyone around me, It reminded me that every human being, regardless of background or belief, is an essential part of the whole. I now feel more committed to contributing positively to the world, spreading kindness and understanding, and helping others see their own divine spark.",

      "reviewBody": "After the financial disaster of Lamhe and Parampara, Yash Chopra casted a then relatively unknown actor called Shah Rukh Khan for his next venture Darr. Not only was the movie hugely successful but it made Shah Rukh an overnight sensation. Since then he has been the Chopra&apos;s lucky mascot,Dil to pagal hai,Veer Zaara(for Yash Chopra), DDLJ,Mohhabatein and Rab ne bana di jodi(for son Aditya Chopra) and Chak De India for Yash Raj films. Whilst it is not as good as DDLJ(then again what movie is?)it is a vast improvement on Mohabbatein. Yash Raj films produced 4 films last year, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom,Tara rum pum pum,Aaja Nachle and Chak De India, Chak De was their only hit and it was a massive one at that. So with Aditya Chopra going behind the camera lens Shah Rukh was the safest best.\n\nShah Rukh is given a very different look, he has a moustache and wears glasses. It tells a story of a very ordinary man who enters into a marriage with a lively girl after her father passes away. She despises him whilst he does everything to please her. She enters into a dancing contest but is embarrassed at the thought of having to dance with her ordinary husband. Then Shah Rukh has an idea, he takes on a completely new avtar and aims to make her fall in love with him. He cuts of his moustache and changes his look but doesn&apos;t have the courage to tell her. So he assumes two identities, one as her dancing partner and one as her husband. Things get complicated when she starts to fall in love with her dancing partner not realising that it&apos;s actually her husband. Shah Rukh realises that the dancing partner has to break her heart and she will have to go back to her husband. In the finale the ordinary husband shows off his moves he learnt from attending the dance classes and his wife falls in love with him. My enjoyment was marred by the improbable plot. I am not bearded and nor do I wear glasses, according to the logic of this movie if tomorrow I don a beard and wear glasses my own family will not be able to recognise me, that doesn&apos;t sound right to me. Now onto the music, as per usual in a Chopra production the songs are absolutely top notch. Haule Haule is very very good and Tuj me rab dikta hai is one of the best love songs I have heard in a long long time. RNBDJ is pretty entertaining leave your brains at the door fare from the Chopra&apos;s and much much better than I expected. Recommended by me,7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Thessaloniki this day. A very sick bearded man leaves his seaside house to go to the hospital for the few days remaining. Suddenly he decides to search the area. He rescues a small Albanian boy chased at the traffic lights by the police while cleaning car windows for a living. He saves the same kid when ready to be sold to foreigners. This happens in Greece but it can happen anywhere. He makes a tour with the kid. He visits the frontier looking like a Nazi camp with spectators watching while hanging on the wire fence. He speaks with Dionysios Solomos,the poet of the &apos;Hymn to liberty&apos; and &apos;Free begieged&apos;.A poet that used to pay people in Zakynthos to buy a word for poetic exploitation. Theo Angelopoulos plays an important sociophilosophical role as a very talented director in expressing the human relation,the national language and many other concepts. Angelopoulos purports to open a new road for understanding the world,life,death,love,poetry,music,child innocence,a man to die very soon,a wedding with the married couple dancing in circle movements. This movie has a faster mode than previous ones by the\n\nsame director. First prize in Cannes in competition with Benigni&apos;s &apos;life is beautiful&apos;. A film with the warm performance of Bruno Ganz. A film with the magnificent music of Eleni Karaindrou. A masterpiece for 10 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "In some ways, it almost seems unfair to compare a sequel to the original, that we should judge it on it&apos;s own merits. However, usually the only reason we are watching a sequel is because of the original, so my review consists primarily in comparison.\n\nThe most interesting thing about Return is how hard the makers tried to make it like the original. They were largely successful. Burt Kennedy&apos;s direction is good and recreates the visual feel of the original. Of course, Bernstein&apos;s score highlights the film. The story, different in particulars, is goes through essentially the same stages: armed men attack the village, the call for help, the gathering of the seven, traveling to the village, defying the villain, the first attack beaten off, a pause where we get to know the characters and their motivations better, the final attack. The only difference is that the villagers do not &apos;betray&apos; their protectors, as in the Magnificent Seven. A character even sneaks into the enemy camp in much the same fashion as in the earlier movie.\n\nThe real weakness of the sequel is the script. Along with the excellent acting and music, the dialogue in the first film was very well written and something of a departure from earlier westerns. It was terse, oftentimes funny, filled with meaning. In Return the delivery and the tone is the same, but the words spoken so solemnly are utterly commonplace and with no humor. Robert Fuller would have been a good replacement for McQueen, but the character is written completely differently and is far less interesting. \n\nThe acting, also, is inferior to the first film.\n\nAnother problem with the film is the portrayal of the peasants. They are a not characters, as in The Magnificent Seven, but a mass. This film is solely about the 7 Americans riding to the rescue to the rescue of defenseless peasants and at times seems to have a pro-intervention (pro-Vietnam?) political subtext that the in first film, which was a translation of Seven Samurai to the New World, was either absent or more subtle.\n\nAll this said and out of the way, film has lots of action, a good score, and Yul Brynner, who is always fun to watch in a western whether it is The Magnificent Seven or Adios, Sabata. Fans of westerns and action films will probably find it entertaining.\n\nFamiliar face Emilio Fernandez, who played Lorca, acted in over 70 films, starting in Mexico, and wrote and directed many of them. The relationship between his character, his dead sons, and Chris could have made a very compelling film. Unfortunately it was not expanded on.",

      "reviewBody": "Nostalgic Schlager - Spaß / hit fun with Caterina Valente\n\nA singer married to an influential minister has scored a few hits incognito, so that everyone is now wondering who the successful singing star actually is. A busy impresario (Hubert von Meyerinck) accidentally books the stage of the prestigious SCALA with the help of his enchanting assistant Trudchen Putzke (sweet as always: Ruth Stephan) in order to finally make the unknown star known. It&apos;s just stupid that Ms. Minister wants to remain unknown at all costs! What could be more obvious than to hire a still undiscovered young singer named Caterina Duval (of course: La Valente!), who performs on the backstage stages in Paris with her partners Silvio (Silvio Francesco) and Nico (Richard Allan), as a supposed super star! It&apos;s just a shame that the proud lady doesn&apos;t want to appear under someone else&apos;s name! The director Robert Mertens (Gerhard Riedmann) still has to do a lot of work...\n\nYou didn&apos;t need more plot for schlager / pop fun from the golden fifties. Caterina Valente was able to rely on a proven dream team with producer Artur Brauner (CCC Film) and screenwriter Curth Flatow (&quot;Ich heirate eine Familie&quot;). The later television legend Erik Ode (1910-1983, &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;) acted as director. The turbulent film premiered on February 22, 1958 in the Stuttgart universe.\n\nCaterina Valente sings one of her biggest hits with &quot;Play again for me, Habanero&quot;. Other songs: &quot;A Night on the Rio Grande&quot;, &quot;Music is in the Air&quot;. Brigitte Mira and Monika Peitsch appear in smaller roles.\n\nOne drawback is that Gerhard Riedmann (1925-2004) remains all too pale as the main character. The chemistry with La Valente isn&apos;t right either. The dance scenes with her brother Silvio Francesco and the great American Richard Allan, whom Marilyn Monroe instigated in &quot;Niagara&quot; to attempt to murder her husband Joseph Cotten, are convincing. Seeing these three sing and dance together was worth the price of admission!\n\nThe great Caterina Valente only celebrated her 90th birthday in January 2021. It&apos;s time to rediscover this great entertainer!",

I appreciate that the film explored the conflict between genders. In some parts it was apparent that it only took 11 days to shoot. On the other hand the production value was impressive considering how quickly the film was completed. The cast seemed to work well together and after viewing the special features of the DVD I saw that it was carried over off screen. One of my favorite things about this film is the colors. It is absolutely beautiful, especially the greens from the plant life. Overall this film is a good bet. I would caution briefly about some of the language. There is no cursing but the standard, &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;shut up,&quot; etc... that kids will probably hear anyway at the local park. In the end it is a cute story that makes you reminisce about the good old days.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gespenster&quot; Question of to be cool in the German cinema\n\nThere are not many German films in the last ten years, who have made me so interest. Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film &quot;Gespenster&quot; too. He is on some places to uncooked to be good to see. Special the figure of Toni (Sabine Timento) is too cool. But thats is in German films always so. Everybody must to learns this coolneß - is the realism in this films. Thats difficult to understand. But in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it. Thats not clear for the other girl Nina in this film. She love her - and she would lose her. But Nina lost everything. She will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling. There is no way - but you must take it said Herbert Achterbusch for twenty years. Thats so often the way it goes in German films. Why? Nina (Julia Hummer) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance. This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside. Thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination. Throw it all away - and go nowhere! But the actress plays this difficult part very interesting. On the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls. The have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera. But the film stand always in some distance to seem. There is no much explaining of them.\n\nIn the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget. The two girls got to a casting. And there they should say how they find together. In this scene Toni will lying on. She said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her. And then Nina will say the truth. She said it in an introversion way. There is no exhibition in it. She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here. Thats a great moment. In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than Toni goes away...\n\nOkay, The film will end - in the German way of coolneß - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing. But there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important. He is more than German coolneß - and this moments are rare in the German cinema in this time!",

After a stunningly directed and framed violent and exciting prologue full of beautiful landscape photography scored with a Ennio Morricone soundtrack the movie transforms into an awkward garbled mess that doesn&apos;t really know what it wants to be.\n\nI have rarely seen a movie nosedive this hard. I would have loved if the movie had stayed a rough wilderness survival adventure piece with a solo Lino Ventura fighting nature and bandits.\n\nBut as it is I can only recommend everyone watch the movie until Lino Ventura arrives in the city and immediately destroy the DVD or Blu-Ray they&apos;re watching, to keep the great impressions of the first arc and spare themselves the sour note of a completely blundered premise.",

      "reviewBody": "There are a lot of great silent films that surprisingly for so long ago do not show their age and aren&apos;t as creaky. Am not saying anything negative about silent films in general, or trying to generalise if it comes over that way, quite the contrary (appreciate them hugely actually, though some don&apos;t hold up as well as others). Found the idea for the story of &apos;Foolish Wives&apos; intriguing and admire Erich Von Stroheim as a director, with &apos;Greed&apos; being a towering achievement in its day and now, and as an actor.\n\n&apos;Foolish Wives&apos; has held up quite well. It is not one of the classic silent films, it is not without its flaws and it is no &apos;Greed&apos;. There is though a good deal to go wow over, it is in many ways an achievement and there is no doubting Von Stroheim&apos;s committment to the project, considering that he did triple duty as lead actor, director and writer. A lot to take on, and he does remarkably well at the task and shows that he was more than up to it.\n\nStarting with what could have been done better, the pace is erratic. It at times suffers from the long length, with the earlier portions of the film being a little too drawn out, uneventful and in need of a trim. At the same time, that &apos;Foolish Wives&apos; was intended to be longer and that there was more material that needed to be cut is also at times evident.\n\nIt still manages to be remarkably cohesive and there was no real trouble for me understanding what goes on, but for my tastes it did start to jump around towards the end and feel on the choppy side. Some of the support acting is uneven, with Miss DuPont having bland, out of her depth moments.\n\nVon Stroheim however is truly magnetic in every sense, one cannot take their eyes off him. Some unevenness aside, most of the acting is not bad at all and even if the characters are not the most rootable they are interesting and far from stock heroism or stock villainy. The direction takes full advantage of the film&apos;s technical mastery and boasts some quite powerful moments. Moments that include the storm sequence and that of the fire set piece, which for the time and now are quite jaw-dropping.\n\nOn a visual and technical level, &apos;Foolish Wives&apos; looks incredible and it has to be one of the best-looking silent films. It was expensive to make and it looks expensive, which is meant in a good way, some surprisingly complex and varied film techniques are here and the sets are a marvel. Have not seen sets this richly detailed or this grand for any film in a long time, and when it comes to silent films it is up there with &apos;Greed&apos;, &apos;The Big Parade&apos; and &apos;The Thief of Baghdad&apos; in this regard. It has the right amount of suspense when needed, some darkly humorous ones and parts are even touching.\n\nSumming up, many great things that would have been even better if the pacing was better. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "After years of hearing about this, I finally tracked down a pirate cassette of this unbelievable film. Oh My God, any fan of bad movies must see this for the thrill of a lifetime!\n\nThis is the film that dares to ask the question, `what happens when a director of bloated epic dramas tries his hand at screwball comedy?&apos; Now ask what happens when he and most Hollywood are desperate to get `with it&apos;, and you&apos;ll be approaching the bizarre truth of `Skidoo&apos;. If you thought Otto Preminger couldn&apos;t get any worse then `Hurry Sundown&apos;, this will prove you quite wrong.\n\nI&apos;m tempted to compare this film with late 60&apos;s wrecks like `Casino Royale&apos;, but it&apos;s really in a different league. Its more like a big budget &quot;Love American Style&quot; episode or a middle-aged embarrassment like `The Mother&apos;s In-Law&apos;. Perhaps there was once a scenario lurking at the bottom of all this, or someone had a screenplay and it blew away. Either way, the whole thing appears to have been edited with a lawn mower.\n\nBut incoherent structure is only part of this remarkable cinematic experience, it also contains the wackiest cast of middle-aged actors ever, all of whom should have known better. Beyond embarrassing for all concerned, which is why it&apos;s so great to watch. Everyone on screen just looks confused, as if Otto&apos;s only direction to them was `act crazy now&apos;. Burgess Meredith chews at his small part like bubble gum, even out doing himself in `Hurry Sundown&apos; or &apos;Such Good Friends&apos;.  Carol Channing is the real mind blower here! I thought I would die when I saw her groovy striptease, but then I saw the film&apos;s climax where she leads a hippie flotilla in a freaked out royal navy uniform as they board Grocho&apos;s yacht while Carol sings the ridiculous theme song. Your life as a film fan is incomplete until you&apos;ve watched this scene and played it back to make sure you really saw it. Jakie Gleason&apos;s acid freak out is even better than Vincent Price&apos;s in `The Tingler&apos;.\n\nThis film had a big budget but from the jailhouse freak out scene, it&apos;s pretty clear that no one working on this acid movie had any idea what tripping was like. Imagine Peter Lawford, Burgess Meredith and Slim Pickens all acting kooky and pretending to freak out. It all ends with Grocho in his last film getting stoned with Austin Pendlton in his first film as drift away in a lifeboat with a tie-dye sail. Then Otto Preminger announces the film is over as Harry Nelson sings the entire credits!\n\nWhat could they have been thinking? This has got to be one of the biggest missteps in Hollywood history. The film seems to have barely been released. I&apos;ve only read one contemporary review of it, and that one describes Carol Channing as `a walking sight gag&apos;. It seems that everyone involved with this film sobered up and decided to quietly bury the evidence. Even today, few bad movie fans know of `Skidoo&apos;, since it is not shown on TV and has never been released on video. Reportedly, Preminger&apos;s daughter controls the negative and is sitting on it to protect here father&apos;s reputation. I found a copy of the film&apos;s soundtrack album in a thrift store a few years back, and it too is a dusey. Once you&apos;ve heard Ms. Channing scream `Skidoo, skidoo, do what ya wanna do&apos; over &amp; over again, you may never been the same. Seek out `Skidoo&apos;, it smells like pumpkins!"

While viewing, it is ever so easy for one to astrally project into the film, thus becoming part of history. The cinematography was second to none. The score was hauntingly beautiful. The casting for each part was perfectly matched to each character, and each role was played at the peak of perfection. The mini series was evenly paced and seemed to hold the viewer spellbound for the next adventure. This film would certainly qualify as an educational tool for kids in junior high and above. I would love to purchase the series, but after years of searching, I have not located a seller."

      "reviewBody": "Alain Delon made his film debut at the age of 21 in this film, translated as Send a Woman when the Devil Fails, I believe. The strict translation is When a Woman Gets Involved. I suppose either one would do. I had to watch this in French without subtitles as it was all I could find at the time.\n\nSet in Paris, the film is about Henri Godot, (Jean Servais) who owns a nightclub. He hires a young man named Jo (Delon) to kill Boby (Yves Deniaud). Meanwhile, Angele (Edwige Feuillere), Henri&apos;s mistress, is hanging around as well. \n\nThen Felix (Bernard Blier) arrives in Paris, meanwhile, with his daughter (Sophie Daumier) by his first wife. He is there to take vengeance for the death of his second wife in a fire that was arson. Jo and the daughter, Colette, fall for one another, which causes some problems. And when the killings begin, a police detective (Pierre Mondy) comes around.\n\nThe director, Yves Allégret, enjoyed a successful career, but he was on a downslide by the time this film came along. He unsuccessfully tried to mix noir and comedy. I found this film unimpressive, except for the fact that it is Delon&apos;s first appearance on screen.\n\nThis film also gave early roles to Bruno Cremer and Sophie Daumier, so there are two generations of film actors. The seniors, particularly Servais and Fuilliere are excellent. Baby-faced Delon in a supporting role starts his 50+ year career as a romantic, cool, but dynamic killer who is still getting his sea legs. \n\nAt one point, while enjoying ice cream with Colette, he spots a car that has been following them. He runs out; Colette hears two shots. Jo re-enters, sits down, and continues eating as if he just put a quarter in a parking meter.\n\nThe end of the film is ambiguous. I felt ambiguous about the whole movie myself.",

      "reviewBody": "In Japan, there is an urban legend that there is a cursed video clip of a suicide released by a man called Kashiwada (Yûsuke Yamamoto) in Internet that drives the viewer also to commit suicide. When the high- school student Noriko Morisaki seeks the video in classroom, her teacher Akane (Satomi Ishihara) takes her cellular to return it after class. But soon Noriko watches the footage at home and dies and the police inspector Koiso goes to the school to interview Akane and her students. Koiso&apos;s assistant Nakamura believes that the video is real, but Koiso does not pay much attention on him. \n\nWhen Akane&apos;s boyfriend Takanori (Kôji Seto) is captured by a woman in the video and Koiso witnesses Nakamura committing suicide, they investigate Kashiwada and discover that his intention is to bring Sadako (Ai Hashimoto) back to a new body and Akane is the chosen one. Now Akane has to fight against Sadako to bring Takanori back and save her life.\n\n&quot;Sadako 3D&quot; is a very bad Japanese horror movie with a senseless story. The plot is silly, with Kashiwada releasing the video to find a strong body to revive Sadako and they actually want Akane&apos;s body. Akane uses her super-scream to get rid of the supernatural creatures as if it were a comedy. So why do they need to make a video to kill people? They are very powerful and wouldn&apos;t be easier if they simply find Akane and use her body to revive Sadako? The conclusion is awful and in the end only the gorgeous lead actress Satomi Ishihara is worth to be watched in this terrible movie. My vote is two. \n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Invocação 3D&quot; (&quot;The Invocation 3D&quot;)",

Maybe this is the reason why I found this film so great: the sound of roaring cars, the pictures of the silent sky, slow motion on details, expressive colours and a thrilling plot. Two enemies, Vaillant and Leader teams, see each other again after 13 years during the 24h of Le Mans, ready for a showdown. While the Leader team never heard about fair play, Michel Vaillant tries to make the best out of a desperate situation. 15 Minutes before the end of the race it seems that he has no chance at all to win the race ... So, if you like racing games (e.g. Project Gotham Racing) this film is a must. After watching it, grab your joystick or wheel , charge Forza Motorsport ans blast your enemies !",

      "reviewBody": "If Griffith had stuck to Lincoln&apos;s personal life, this could have been an interesting, amusing, and occasionally insightful film. Griffith gives us a multi-layered and largely accurate portrait of Lincoln the man. We see the ungainly country lawyer, countrified in speech and manner, often serious, even melancholy, but with a rare ability to find humor in the most unlikely places and to laugh even at himself. We see Lincoln the inveterate story-teller, the insomniac, the doting father, the determined commander-in-chief the patient husband. If this had been the whole of the film, it would have been easy to overlook its painfully outdated style and to forgive its frequent omissions and exaggerations as poetic license.\n\nUnfortunately, the film necessarily includes Lincoln&apos;s political life, and here it moves from poetic license to outright falsehood. Slavery was the central issue of Lincoln&apos;s political career, a fact that Griffith tries to obscure, going so far as to turn Lincoln&apos;s pivotal &apos;House Divided&apos; speech into an argument against secession. This is particularly ironic since it was really Lincoln&apos;s battle cry against encroaching slavery. When South Carolinians seceded two years later, this was the speech they pointed to as proof that when Lincoln took office, &quot;the slaveholding States will no longer have the power of self-government ... and the Federal Government will have become their enemy.&quot; \n\nDuring Lincoln&apos;s presidency, the question of slavery occupied much of his time and attention, yet again Griffith chooses to ignore it. His Lincoln spends more time admiring the courage of Confederate soldiers than worrying about slavery. Even the Emancipation Proclamation gets only the briefest attention. Lincoln reads a line from the document, signs it, and says, &quot;Well, gentlemen, it is done.&quot; It&apos;s oddly dismissive, coming from a man who considered emancipation the central act of his presidency and the most meaningful act of his life.\n\nDenied his opposition to slavery and concomitant commitment to democracy and the inalienable rights of man, Lincoln is reduced to endlessly repeating, &quot;The Union must be preserved.&quot; Why it must be preserved is left to the audience&apos;s imagination. The film never gives us the slightest clue."

      "reviewBody": "Dennis Lee adapts Frost&apos;s poem with the same title. With such a big names associated with it, I wonder why &apos;Fireflies in the Garden&apos; never got a US theatrical release. It is a well executed film. Danny Moder&apos;s cinematography is breathtaking and Javier Navarrete&apos;s score is superb. The story has an interesting premise but it needed fleshing out. It looks patchy at times. The casting is also a little awkward. Emily Watson and Hayden Panettiere are too different to play the same character convincingly and this was difficult for me to overlook. That said, Panettiere was quite decent and Watson is first rate but she deserved more screen time (and her character, the older Jane, needed more fleshing out). Ditto for Julia Roberts who, despite of a small role, has a strong presence throughout the entire film. I find her character&apos;s actions questionable. For example why does she choose to leave her husband when he cheats on her while all those years she stays with him when he&apos;s abusing their son? Ryan Reynolds shows growth as an actor. He displayed maturity in &apos;Definitely, Maybe&apos; and seems to be going the right way as an actor. Willem Dafoe too does a terrific job from being the hateful father to being the softer old man but I would have liked to see more of the transformation in Charles because on the one hand he is shown to be a loving father (as shown in the home video) but on the other hand he doesn&apos;t seem to have changed much (the scene in the car when they&apos;re on their way to visit Jane and his temper at the dinner table). The director could have shown more of Lisa and Charles during their later years. I also liked Cayden Boyd&apos;s performance. Ioan Gruffudd and Carrie-Anne Moss do not have more than a couple of scenes. &apos;Fireflies in the Garden&apos; seems like a well intentioned movie but it appears too rushed and patchy to fully involve the viewer. It needed more than 95 minutes of screen time. The visuals, soundtrack and performances make it a decent watch."

      "reviewBody": "Viy is based on the same story, written by Nikolai Gogol, that inspired Mario Bava&apos;s masterpiece, Black Sunday. While the films have some similarities; for example, a witch and a fairytale atmosphere; the two really aren&apos;t much alike. Black Sunday went more for the straight horror, and was a better film for it. Viy is more of a religious themed film, and the witch plot line offers more in the way of the faith of the lead character than actual horror. The film has a massive amount of cult value, mostly due to the fact that it&apos;s not much like any other movie in terms of its style. The music and atmosphere combine to give it an other-worldly feel, and this helps massively where the plot is concerned. The basis of the film follows a man of God who must spend three days and three nights presiding over the corpse of a young girl, who also happens to be the local witch. Being dead isn&apos;t much of a hindrance to the witch, as she bombards our hero with black magic. With only his faith to protect him; will he be able to last three nights with her corpse? \n\nThe first half of the movie is really rather dull, as not a lot happens and it seems to mostly be a set-up for the latter section. The plot does pick up as the film goes on; but the film is never massively engaging, and that is its main downfall. However, the cinematography is great; and Viy has a very vibrant feel throughout. Black Sunday had a similar vibrant feel; and this film gives the viewer an idea of what Bava&apos;s film might have looked like in colour. The scenes that take place inside the church are the movie&apos;s main strongpoint, thus making it a shame that there aren&apos;t more of them. These scenes look great and brilliantly offset the gentle tone of the rest of the film. The climax delivers the best part of the movie, and the special effects there, while obviously cheap, look stunning and brilliantly suit the style of the film. Russia isn&apos;t very well known for its film industry, and this was one of the first horror films produced in the Soviet Union. Modern flick Night Watch has given the Russian film industry a new lease of life recently; and this film, like most other classics, is set for a remake. Oh well...I recommend Viy mainly to fans of art-house cinema.",

The different places where the radio amateurs are, bring you an interesting feeling. The radio in Togo has an special meaning, it&apos;s the link with the world, and with the blind man has another meaning, is the link with life and hope. I enjoyed this film very much even though the language is hard for me. I&apos;ll be waiting for somebody who could give me Spanish or English translation. Thank you."

      "reviewBody": "Connecting Rooms&apos; is a bleak chamber drama, similar in mood and setting to Separate Tables&apos; but nowhere near so interesting as that film. I&apos;m not aware that Connecting Rooms&apos; was ever released anywhere: I saw it at a trade screening, and not one of the cinema exhibitors in the audience showed any interest in booking this movie  despite the box-office value of Bette Davis and Michael Redgrave.\n\nJames Wallraven (Redgrave) is a schoolmaster who has been dismissed for sexual misconduct with one of his students: the script is careful to let us know that Wallraven was unfairly accused (unlike the equivalent character in Separate Tables&apos;, played by David Niven in his Oscar-winning performance). The disgraced Wallraven lives in a dilapidated rooming house in Bayswater, hoping that no one here will learn his shameful secret. He meets Wanda Fleming, a repressed cellist (Davis). This film was based on a (flop) stage play called The Cellist&apos;, and Davis&apos;s role is clearly the central character in this film. A tentative relationship develops between Wallraven and Wanda.\n\nWanda&apos;s student is a scruffy young man named Mickey Hollister (Alexis Kanner), who lusts for fame as a songwriter. Mickey also lusts for Wanda, even though he&apos;s a lot younger and better-looking than she is. Jealous that Wanda is giving her attentions to Wallraven, Mickey reveals Wallraven&apos;s secret  without revealing that Wallraven is innocent.\n\nThis whole thing is a soap opera. Leo Genn and Kay Walsh give good performances in supporting roles. Redgrave&apos;s role would have been much more interesting (and his performance more challenging) if his character had actually been guilty of the sex crime. By far, the best performance on offer here is Alexis Kanner&apos;s. Although Kanner is an extremely pretentious actor, he&apos;s also a very physical actor who takes risks. In many of his TV and film roles, what Kanner does onscreen is wrong  but he nearly always does something interesting and unexpected. He&apos;s vital, virile and primally evil as the covetous Hollister. If Kanner had channelled his talents more intelligently, and disciplined himself, he could have been the British version of James Dean.\n\nAt the end of the film, Bette Davis and Michael Redgrave walk past a theatre poster for a play starring an actress named Margo Channing (the character Davis played in All About Eve&apos;). This wasn&apos;t a very good in-joke, as it reminds us of a film that&apos;s much better than Connecting Rooms&apos;, in which Bette Davis gives a much better performance than she does here. I&apos;ll reluctantly rate this movie 2 points out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shine&quot; is a pure joy to behold.  Produced in Australia, it tells the true story of piano prodigy David Helfgott.  Helfgott suffered a major nervous breakdown on the threshold of an imminently great career.  The story shows him through a psychologically trying childhood, to his teenage years when he perfected his skills, to a stay in a mental asylum, and his subsequent return to stardom.  Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) played Helfgott during his teenage and adult years. Armin Mueller-Stahl is also excellent as the abusive father (in an Oscar-nominated performance).  However, the film stalls on several occasions.  This is bad considering that the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  Lynn Redgrave&apos;s role is terrible, she is totally wrong for this film.  &quot;Shine&quot; is a prime example of a near miss.  The film is very good in almost all aspects, but these problems keep &quot;Shine&quot; from being the masterpiece it should have been.  4 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "When I decided to check out &quot;The Tournament&quot; the expectations were moderate. Actually I expected it to be a pleasant DTV title with a couple of cool actors.\n\nWhat I got instead was a thrilling actioner that surpasses most of the theatrical releases of the same genre. The action is hyperkinetic and violent, and Scott Mann has undisputed Hollywood potential.\n\nThe plot about the assassin tournament is clean and simple, a lot like &quot;Taken&quot; and when it comes to comparison between these two films, only advantage for &quot;Taken&quot; is Liam Neeson. &quot;The Tournament&quot; provides solid acting but it doen&apos;t have such a potent star. Actually, if we consider its budget, &quot;The Tournament&quot; is really outstanding in terms of casting because it combines available theatrical-feature actors like Kelly Hu, Liam Cunningham,, Robert Carlyle and Ving Rhames with top DTV names like Scott Adkins. Scott Adkins&apos; potential was obvious ever since he first appeared in Isaac Florentine films and in &quot;the Tournament&quot; he is accompanied by Sebastien Foucan, the parkourist we remember from &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.\n\nFight scenes are marvelously staged, with great fight choreography, but also outstanding gunplay and vehicle stunts. When it comes to the sheer amount of action &quot;The Tournament&quot; gives you the most for bang for the buck. It is very hard to invent some new kinds of action set-pieces and choreographies but in a couple of scenes &quot;Rhe Tournament&quot; does that.\n\nAlso, you must bear in mind that action is very violent and gory. The sheer amount of gore is comparable to Neill Blomkamp&apos;s &quot;District 9&quot;. Bloodletting is stylish and lavish and Scott Mann really has the guts (quite literally) to pull it off.\n\nI am surprised that this film failed to get theatrical release. I mean, it&apos;s quite obvious that American distributors wouldn&apos;t release because none of the stars are a draw in the US but I guess it should&apos;ve worked quite well internationally.\n\nWriter Gary Young was lucky to move on into theatrical business with Matthew Vaughn production &quot;Harry Brown&quot;. I hope Scott Mann will accomplish the same.",

      "reviewBody": "Rex Ingram is probably best remembered for directing Rudolph Valentino&apos;s breakthrough film THE FOUIR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE (1921) but he ventured into the fledgling terror genre with this thriller starring Paul (The Golem) Wegener.\n\nWegener&apos;s character, Dr. Oliver Haddo, is allegedly based on the real life character Alastair Crowley. When we first meet him he is in attendance as the famous Dr. Burdon (Ivan Petrovich) saves the life of lovely Margaret Dauncey (Alice Terry, the real life Mrs. Ingram) with an operation on her spine. While recovering, Margaret falls in love with Dr. Burdon and he returns her affections. Dr. Haddo is interested in her too but for far less healthy reasons. Dr. H you see, has been searching for the way to create artificial life in the laboratory (sound familiar?) and a old book on alchemy has informed him that he needs &quot;the heart blood of a maiden&quot; added to certain other chemicals to make this happen.\n\nSo determined is Haddo to make this happen that he hypnotises Margaret and marries her while she is under his spell. At his mountain top lab he plans to complete his diabolical experiment. Will Margaret lose her own life so Haddo can create life? Will Dr. Burdon find her in time? Ah . . . that would be telling!\n\nWhat many of us wonder is, is Haddo a real magician or just a very good hypnotist? In one scene he allows a poisonous snake to bite him but makes the lethal wound vanish with just a wave of his hand. Just a moment later the same snake bites a young woman and she must be rushed to hospital. Now most of us know that a venomous snake expels all its venom at the first bite so the fact that it was the second bite that felled the woman should have been a tipoff that Haddo was not bitten at all. Yes, but remember this is a movie and we have to build up suspense. An amusing scene has Dr. Burdon and Dr. Haddo meeting for the first time in a park. As Haddo walks away Burdon remarks to Margaret &quot;He looks like he stepped out of a melodrama!&quot;. As if on cue Haddo glares back, throws his cape over his shoulder and makes a perfect stage exit! It is an innocuous but effective moment and briefly clouds the menace that will soon be facing the lovers.\n\nThe sequence most people remember is where Haddo gives Margaret a look at Hell. It is a rugged looking place but rather removed from the horrors of the Italian film L&apos;INFERNO (1909) or even DANTE&apos;S INFERNO (1926). The place is loaded with damned souls but they all dance around carefree while Pan (at least I think it&apos;s Pan) plays a tune on his pipes. Another faun (dancer Hubert Stowitts) takes Margaret in his arms and passionately kisses her as the dream ends. So did they really go to Hell or was it all a hypnotic dream? In a key scene soon after this Haddo visits Margaret at her home and we clearly see his lips say the words &quot;your rape&quot; which sends her into the deepest despair. Whether the rape was actual or just implied quickly becomes a moot point because she goes away with him, convinced she can never marry Dr. Burdon now.\n\nElements of the final reels of THE MAGICIAN figure prominently in the Universal film FRANKENSTEIN (1931). Haddo has a monolithic castle at the top of a mountain, a dwarf assistant do you think his name is Fritz?) and a well equipped lab. I think that not only director James Whale but also the set designer for FRANKENSTEIN had to have sat through this film more than once.\n\nTalkies came along about a year after this film was completed and Wegener, who was uncertain of his ability to speak English, returned to Germany. He was not alone, he was soon joined by Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt and several other actors who had their doubts about being able to effectively perform in a foreign (to them)language.\n\nSo is THE MAGICIAN worth seeing? Yes it is, despite its shortcomings it is a well paced and convincingly performed thriller. Give it a try.",

      "reviewBody": "Those who anticipate, as I did, that this will be yet another of the Alain Delon &apos;policiers&apos; of this period, are in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nIn the classic French policier/film noirs the goodies and the baddies are sharply defined but in the hybrid &apos;neo-polar&apos; genre that flourished in the 1970&apos;s one is none too sure whom to trust. The dark and sinister forces at work here are the corrupt politicians, dodgy policemen and shadowy multi-nationals.\n\nThis stylish piece directed by Georges Lautner is arguably one of the best of its type. It is a little verbose but with dialogue by Michel Audiard spoken by this excellent cast one doesn&apos;t mind too much.\n\nThe &apos;uncredited&apos; contribution to the screenplay by Claude Sautet serves to enhance the film&apos;s quality.\n\nAlain Delon is at the height of his popularity here and received a César nomination for his performance as a moral crusader. He both produces and stars and again plays opposite the splendid Maurice Ronet while Stéphane Audran, Daniel Ceccaldi and Klaus Kinski are great value as always. By all accounts Herr Kinski, much to everyone&apos;s surprise and relief, turned out to be a real pussycat. Delon&apos;s partner at the time, Mireille Darc, who made a few films for this director, has a pretty thankless role as Delon&apos;s partner! The eye candy is supplied by Ornella Muti. Who is the murderer? Well, as Agatha Christie reminds us, it is always the one you suspect the least.\n\nTremendous production values here with legendary Henri Decae replacing Lautner&apos;s regular cameraman Maurice Fellous. Lautner has again used the much respected composer Philippe Sarde and as a bonus we have the sound of the saxaphone played by the brilliant but troubled Stan Getz. The film just about sustains its length.\n\nFrance is certainly no stranger to political scandals so this particular genre must really have struck a cord but of course the French do not have a monopoly in this regard.\n\nAs a certain Henry Kissinger once observed: &quot;Corrupt politicians make the other 10% look bad&quot;!",

      "reviewBody": "Returning to his home-town, a teacher and his family find that the traumatic incident involving his big brother while he was growing up has caused the greaser-gang also included in the event to come back and torment them forcing a final showdown to right the wrong.\n\nThis one here wasn&apos;t all that bad even though it does have some issues. One of the film&apos;s biggest positives is the fact that this one really manages to get the fear of being involved in a traumatic incident from the past in a small-town. The fact that the initial accident itself feels like the kind of accident that really could happen in such a location, with the greaser gang tormenting them and then getting caught up in the train coming through the tunnel does come off like a rather enjoyable setup for later, and with the way this holds up the different incidents later on that trigger the incidents later on. From the dropped set of car-keys to the shoes and the kids coming one-by-one into the classroom, the set-up from these incidents plays a great part in how this one manages to come off when it starts to reveal what their actual purpose is for returning. Those are quite fun as the different variations of them appearing as students in his classroom while taunting him in the town, the ways in which they manage to fool everyone in class as well as the town who constantly think he&apos;s having mental breakdowns based on his past history which comes into play quite nicely and overall manages to give this one a great build-up for the story to play out in the later half. With the group out and tormenting him and his family with some rather impressive stalking scenes of the family at the house and the later scene in the church where they get taken away leading into the final confrontation in the tunnel once again as this makes for a rather thrilling and engaging finish that plays out the fateful accident that came through in the rest of the film. With these action-packed scenes that come together into giving this a lot to like alongside the few fine make-up effects on the ghouls who look quite creepy and chilling, there&apos;s enough to like here that really manages to hold off the few minor flaws present. The film&apos;s biggest issue is the fact that we&apos;re not given a reason to care about why the greaser club is seeking revenge, as the film makes the point of them coming back for him killing them only they deserved their fate so it&apos;s really troubling to get into the story. The gang is a total joke that simply act like tough-guy greasers but are just so over-the-top in their silly threats that it makes for a pretty hard time to find fear in them for the whole film as they&apos;re return doesn&apos;t make any sense. The other big issue here does manage to carry on about that with there not being any real reason stated about why they come back to begin with as there&apos;s just nothing explained about why they come back to life here at that point in time. By simply showing up saying they want revenge but never explaining how they manage to do so when they clearly never deserved to do so in the first place makes them so simply non-threatening that as a whole the film really stumbles with the main villains. That it also gets a little too schmaltzy with the fantasy-driven finale that looks quite goofy and silly against the more realistic elements, these here do hold it down somewhat.\n\nRated R: Language and Violence.",

The blackmail part of the deal is foiled when accomplice Crawford is befriended by Melvyn Douglas, the victim&apos;s husband (and plastic surgeon!); after restoring her beauty, Douglas must then stop Joan from carrying out the murder plot, targeting a child no less! Remake of an early Ingrid Bergman movie (1938&apos;s &quot;En Kvinnas ansikte&quot;), which in turn was based upon a French play, the film is over-plotted and over-flowing with hectic minutiae and chatty supporting characters. Also complicating matters is a story-frame set in the Royal Swedish Court: seems Joan is indeed on trial for murder, but whom did she kill? Despite a slow beginning, this turns out to be a rather shrewdly devised, sharply written melodrama, with some delicious turns of the screw. Crawford and Douglas work smoothly together (they were reteamed for a comedy the following year, &quot;They All Kissed the Bride&quot;), and the cinematography and art direction are marvelous. George Cukor directed, without a sense of humor, and the script might&apos;ve stood some paring down. Otherwise, shamefully entertaining. **1/2 from ****",

Tomas Milian (Traffic, Amistad, etc) was very popular in Italy for different roles but here he does a great work playing a man who loses the wife. But his son keeps on seeing the mother... Plot will quickly turn in a simple science fiction story. Not bad also Laura Morante (La Stanza Del Figlio). Branduardi&apos;s soundtrack is melancholic and it gives some &quot;maturity&quot; to the movie. The only special effects for this movie are simple blue laser lights. Italians science fictions movies,as we know, were quite poor. My vote is 6 out of 10.\n\nLuci Lontane = Distant Lights",

      "reviewBody": "Some of the people who &quot;review&quot; flicks here continually amaze me with their complete lack of film knowledge.\n\nWhen I heard an interview with the always-extraordinary Sean Penn, in which he said he was upset that so few people had seen what he considers to be his best work: this film and the excellent &quot;At Close Range,&quot; I knew that I had to catch this.\n\nThen, finding that it was based on an unproduced John Cassavetes script, I was all the more eager.\n\nThat final statement should scare off anyone who expected a happy, romantic Hollywood film, as they clearly haven&apos;t seen any of the late writer/director&apos;s stark, realistic films.  Cassavetes&apos; work relied heavily on tortured, unlikable or unredeemable characters who can act their brains out [quite often portrayed by his wife/widow, Gena Rowlands].\n\nWe&apos;re talking serious fare, folks ~ required viewing such as &quot;Husbands,&quot; &quot;Woman Under The Influence,&quot; &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; [the brilliant Rowlands original, not the adequate Sharon Stone remake].\n\nNow comes his former B-movie star &amp; son, Nick, who dusts off papa&apos;s script and enlists the type of actors who are eminently qualified to play a group of true undesirables: Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton, Debi Mazar and the newly-retalented John Travolta, who appears in the last reel.\n\nEven Mom [Rowlands, of course] gets a small but important role.\n\nAnd the adorable Kelsey Mulrooney, playing Penn &amp; Penn&apos;s nine-year-old daughter is terrific without stooping to precociousness.\n\nIs this a brutally honest film?  Yep.  Is it vulgar in nearly every way?  Of course.  Do the leading characters have any chance of redemption, moral or otherwise?  Not likely.\n\nDo I care?\n\nLet&apos;s just say that there&apos;s more passionate acting in &quot;She&apos;s So Lovely&quot; than was evident in nearly every other 1997 film.\n\nAnd that&apos;s certainly good enough for me.\n\nSo there.",

      "reviewBody": "I must admit, going into this film, I was rather excited; I&apos;ve enjoyed both of David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen&apos;s previous collaborations and my interest in both Freudian psychology/psychoanalysis and Michael Fassbender practically guaranteed that I would be seeing this film. I fear now, however, that my expectations may have been a bit too high. \n\nI must admit, however, that I thought that Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen played their roles very well, although Mortensen definitely didn&apos;t receive as much screen time as he deserved. Vincent Cassel definitely shone in his extended cameo as Otto Gross. I did have some issues with Keira Knightly&apos;s acting, however. I feel like she may have over exaggerated her actions, particularly in the beginning scenes where she is in the midst of hysteria.\n\nHowever, my real problem with this film is that, for lack of a better term, it all seems a little too shallow. Events that should be important are skimmed over and not explained; to be honest, it doesn&apos;t particularly seem like anything of real importance happens in the film. The characters have little depth; despite the fact that they are all playing rather well known persons, there simply isn&apos;t anything to them other than a name. On top of this, despite what the taglines of the film and trailer seem to suggest, the relationship between Freud and Jung is hardly explored. For the most part, their scenes involve reading letters from the other. This is hardly compelling viewing. \n\nOverall, I feel like this film would have been better if it had been longer. If the film had a running time of even two hours, compared to one and a half, more character development could have been inserted, particularly for Freud. In addition, more focus on Jung&apos;s relationship with Freud, rather than his relationship with Spielrein, would have been nice to see. \n\nHere&apos;s hoping that any future collaborations between Cronenberg and Mortensen pack a bit more of a punch.",

      "reviewBody": "I only recently became aware of this early Lenzi swashbuckler, but I had read generally favourable assessments of it; having now watched it myself, I quite agree that the film is an above-average peplum – with star Lisa Gastoni in fine form (though most other credits are unfamiliar, including American leading man Jerome Courtland!). Acquired via a late-night Italian TV screening, the print was apparently a hybrid – as the main titles were severely panned-and-scanned, while the rest was in the proper aspect ratioalbeit of hardly optimal quality!\n\nThe plot (while supposedly set in England and the Americas, the road signs are conspicuously displayed in Italian!) deals with lady criminal Mary Read – who is already notorious when we first meet her, even if operating on a small-scale level. She ends up in prison after committing a theft while donning male attire; her philandering cellmate happens to be the son of a lord (Courtland), and it does not take him long to realize her true gender – of course, the heroine freshening up while he is ostensibly asleep does not help her conceal the fact! However, their relationship runs hot and cold: after the nobleman is released and she escapes (by chaining the door to the window bars which, when the former is forced open by prison attendants the latter get unhinged!), he makes fun of her to his peers. She swears to get even and, to this end, falls in with a pirate leader bearing the unfortunate name of Captain Poof! When he is killed in a raid, she even assumes his identity; her buccaneering exploits become the stuff of legend: at one point, we are told that she has taken up residence in the colonies with the likes of Blackbeard and Sir Henry Morgan (but these historical figures never actually come into play)! \n\nThe male protagonist, on the other hand, is scolded by his dad and offered three courses of action to follow: marry a rich ugly woman (which, when he refuses, presumably becomes his mother-in-law since she is subsequently father&apos;s constant companion!), take monastic vows or opt for a military career. He chooses the minor evil amongst them and settles on the latter: given his clout at court, he is almost instantly entrusted with the biggest ship in the British fleet...yet he proceeds to scuttle the Governor&apos;s vessel, after being deliberately misled by Poof! However, he determines to make up for his error by offering to catch the feared pirate single-handed: when he finally boards the ship and finds Mary in the captain&apos;s cabin, he berates her for having become his lover – only to be told that she herself is Poof. Still, they predictably patch up their differences and, when the Governor comes to assist Courtland and wrecks the buccaneer&apos;s vessel, the hero passes Read off as a captive; back at court, dad is happy his offspring is, at long last, ready to settle down. All in all, this proves a lively and colourful entertainment, though perhaps too low-key to stick in the memory for too long...",

It&apos;s comic booky 80&apos;s horror with almost a (cheesy) superhero approach, although things turn insane in the last act.\n\nKari Whitman is a highlight on the feminine front as protagonist Melody while Kimber Sissons is on hand as statuesque Suzie. Of course, Morgan is her usual striking self.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot at Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills (also used in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;) and Sherman Oaks Galleria with studio stuff done in Valencia, all in the Los Angeles area.\n\nGRADE: B-/C+",

      "reviewBody": "This ultra low-budgeted and virtually unknown war/drama movie is probably the most interesting from an &quot;acting&quot; point-of-view. &quot;War Hunt&quot; remarkably  but I suppose coincidentally as well  features the big screen debuts of no less than three names that are nowadays considered hugely famous and acclaimed. Director Sydney Pollack (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and charismatic star Tom Skerritt both appear in small yet memorable roles, while Robert Redford (later star of classics such as &quot;The Sting&quot; and &quot;All The President&apos;s Men&quot;) debuts in the fairly complex leading role of idealistic soldier in the center of a senseless Korean war zone. And yet, in spite of the more appealing great names, it&apos;s unquestionably the still underrated veteran actor John Saxon who steals the show. Even more so, Saxon owns the film and he&apos;s genuinely petrifying as the introvert soldier who appears to use the Korean War to give rein to his murderous and psychotic tendencies. When the young and inexperienced private Loomis arrives at the front during the last stage of the Korean War, his fellow soldiers immediately warn him to stay out of the way of Private Endore and his protégé Charlie; a local orphan kid. Endore is a brilliant soldier and of immeasurably value to the American army, but that is mainly because he single-handedly decreases the number of Korean soldiers by deliberately sneaking behind enemy lines at night. Private Loomis protests against this, especially because he wants to protect the young Charlie from his dangerous colleague. The rudimentary plot of &quot;War Hunt&quot; is actually pretty genius, since it&apos;s the first and only film  at least, as far as I know  that openly suggests signing up for the army is the ideal method for psychopathic killers to get away with their incontrollable urges and even get honored for them! Private Endore is anti-social, impolite and without manners but his superiors never cease to cover from him because he&apos;s such a powerful weapon against the enemy. The atmosphere of &quot;War Hunt&quot; is aptly depressing and dark, with some really brilliant musical choices and bleak photography. Presumably due to the absence of financial means, there&apos;s a severe shortage of action scenes and hence you&apos;ll have to struggle yourself through a handful of seemingly dull and redundant moments. Still, if it&apos;s not necessarily boisterous gunfire and violent battles in the trenches you&apos;re searching for, I would definitely recommend &quot;War Hunt&quot;, if it were only for John Saxon&apos;s stupendous performance. His menacingly painted faced, the desolate star in his eyes and his completely unpredictable and impulsive personality make this one of the greatest performances I&apos;ve ever seen in a low-keyed war epic.",

However, Bourvil always bores me while Fufu is a delight: he may be nervous but i can feel behind a great humanity and i really like his beat.\n\nHere, they are filmed in Italy in the sixties and it&apos;s cool to see how it was like 50 years ago. Personally, i found this movie funnier than the one mentioned above but it lacks its dramatic background as well. The idea of someone who is spied who is spied is original and I don&apos;t think it has been used often. Maybe the great surprise of this movie should be its score because Delerue finds a lot of very great themes!\n\nAnd the car repair scene at night edited with Rossini&apos;s TARENTELLA is one of the best comedy scene ever: it&apos;s crazy, funny, punchy, lyrical: everything is told without a single words: BRAVISSIMA🇮🇹",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; is one of the best movies made during the war years. While the typical war film made during WWII avoided realism in favor of jingoism and propaganda, this one excels because it tried to get the facts right and plays almost like a documentary merged with a typical Hollywood drama. When you read about the efforts that MGM went to make the film, you realize it was a real labor of love and the movie holds up remarkably well today. \n\nThis film is about the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan which occurred in 1942. While the actual physical impact of the bombing raid was not especially great, it was a bit public relations victory-- bolstering American morale and reducing the Japanese sense of invulnerability which had been prevalent. \n\nThe movie begins shortly before the men were recruited for the raid and follows them through training, the actual raid and the fate of a bomber crew. Incidentally, all the planes were lost in the raid...it was intended as a one-way mission.\n\nWhat makes the film strong is not just the emphasis on realism but the acting and direction. Van Johnson was sort of an &apos;everyman&apos; for the audience to love and root for...and MGM did a great job ladling on the sentimentality but not laying it on too thick. Having supporting actors like Spencer Tracy, Robert Walker and Robert Mitchum sure didn&apos;t hurt, either! All in all, a great film and an excellent tribute to these crazy but very brave men who did what their country asked. As for the best scene in the movie, it&apos;s a little one with no dialog...as you see a Chinese woman crying silently as some of the injured Americans are being taken to safety. Stunning.\n\nBy the way, an excellent but over-the-top film about crew captured by the Japanese following the Doolittle Raid is also portrayed in Twentieth Century Fox&apos;s &quot;The Purple Heart&quot;. It&apos;s an excellent film but occasionally lapses into propaganda mode a few times too often to be taken as seriously as &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;.",

The Songs in it is something worth talkin about there has been done a great job on the songs so they really deserve extra credit.

Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes Eva returning to her father&apos;s home in a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva. They fall in love for each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home. Eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. \n\nI have just watched &quot;Extase&quot; for the first time, and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. There are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are badly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear. The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Êxtase&quot; (&quot;Ecstasy&quot;)",

They decide to swap their bad position with his superior Section Chief Elliott Gordon (Frankie Faison) working undercover in an abduction case, disguised in the two spoiled white daughters of a tycoon, Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, getting in hilarious situations.\n\nI like the silly and funny movies that Keenen Ivory Wayans directs. His formula, mixing gross, low level and racist jokes are hilarious and highly recommended for days when you are down and trouble. My soccer time lost the game in the afternoon and I was very upset. While watching &quot;White Chicks&quot;, I laughed a lot and I really liked this comedy, which will never be nominated to an Oscar or to Cannes. But it is delightful to shutdown the brain and feel amusement and joy with this type of silliness to improve the humor. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;As Branquelas&quot; (&quot;White Chicks&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I have always been fascinated by history as a subject and just cannot understand why so few people show any interest in it. I have no illusions, Marcel Ophüls&apos; long documentary about the life and times of Klaus Barbie, a brutally efficient German police chief in occupied France in World War Two, will hardly convert anyone into an avid historian. But I think it is a collective testimony that will outlive the present and could be used in history classes in a number of countries all over the world. Today and tomorrow. \n\nThe director, who throughout the movie appears as an interviewer, is an angry man. He acts accordingly and knows what he wants from the faces he encounters during the making of Hôtel Terminus. And he has an almost uncanny talent to get from the interviewed what he wants. But it feels real and I am positive that Hôtel Terminus is a frank and biased documentary. Its main aim is to convey information about facts and human nature. No one will ever be able to use it for any kind of indoctrination. \n\nBasically, the movie is a biography of Barbie, from the beginnings in provincial Germany up to his trial in the late eighties in Lyon. Ophüls visits  apparently within a very short stretch of time - the places where Barbie lived: in Germany, France and Bolivia. He talks to people there. Some have to say something about Barbie and what he did, some have not  or do not want to. A wide range of statements and non-statements is artfully woven into a tissue that shows how concerned respectively unconcerned humanity as a whole can be about past events, however terrible they are. Shots of landscapes, short sequences of documentary footage and excerpts of local folkloric or popular tunes are cleverly inserted into that texture and give the statements additional emotional weight.\n\nThe movie is very concerned about two particular incidents. This maybe constitutes a weakness because the attention is directed away from Barbie. It probes deeply into the arrest and the disappearance of legendary French resistance leader Jean Moulin and into the abduction of the «enfants d&apos;Isieux», Jewish children who found shelter in an isolated boarding school and were betrayed to the German forces of occupation. The point here is, that Barbie as the man held responsible for the two incidents had to count on French collaborators. There were suspicions that the French authorities were for a long time not very anxious to bring Barbie to trial as he had inside knowledge that would tarnish the official history of France during World War Two. The two «sub chapters» feel as if they were made specifically for a French audience, especially in the intricate Moulin affair it is difficult for an outsider to follow.\n\nThe most striking result of Hôtel Terminus is that it shows the brutal banality of terror in a totalitarian regime. Barbie, basically a public servant with a sadistic streak who executes orders he was given, does not really become alive as a character. Somehow he gradually vanishes further and further into the background. He does not play the chief villain in this movie but is used as an example of one of many ruthless henchmen of a tyranny. The message of Hôtel Terminus is, as I see it, that only the complicity or the indifference of the &quot;general public&quot; made Barbie&apos;s career and the atrocities he was capable of possible."

It also has a black playing a major role that is not a typical maid or servant, but more of a wise cracking best friend. Barbara Stanwyck, who I never considered very attractive, is quite stunning in a trampish sort of way. You will recognize a very young John Wayne as one of her boy friends, as well as many other character actors and actresses of the day. The woman playing the black girl, is new to me, she has a nice voice, as she sings a few jazz tunes of the era, I wonder what happened to her. This movie was before the Hays Code of Decency and it shows. I highly recommended this movie."

Intellectuals who are on the verge of middle age are stagnating professionally and suffocating intellectually. They can&apos;t talk freely; they can&apos;t think freely. They have a burning desire to reform and to improve their little socialist country, but obstacles are everywhere. An older, inflexible generation holds on while paying mere lip-service to youth, progress, and innovation. What will happen? Is change possible? \n\nAt 38 years of age, Daniel Brenner is a no-longer-young architect looking for his first big break. One of his former professors decides to help him out and introduces Daniel to an older architect who is now a city-planning administrator and Communist Party official. Daniel is asked to put together a team of &quot;young&quot; architects to enter a competition to design a town center. A team of handpicked architects whom he knew in his college days, they propose a center complete with a post office, grocery story, restaurants, cinema, theater, bowling alley, art gallery, and monuments, all situated in architecture that is innovative for East Germany. It signals a fresh start and a new responsiveness.\n\nBut here is where Daniel&apos;s problems begin. The very officials who appointed him are resistant to change. The proposal is too expensive, too difficult to build, too innovative, too intellectually honest, too everything. Daniel tries to win them over, but can he make a difference? Meanwhile, members of his team are losing faith in him and in the system. Even worse, as he gives everything to push for the proposal, his personal life is falling apart around him. His wife is bored with the monotony of life in East Germany and resentful about the lost chances in her life. Will Daniel have any achievements in his life, or will he be a professional failure, divorced, and trapped in country that doesn&apos;t want his input?\n\nThis movie was filmed in and around East Berlin in 1989 and 1990. The scenery is stark and accurate. This movie had the bad fortune to be released as East Germany was falling apart and reunification was underway. Audiences no longer cared to dwell on how stultifying East Germany had been. They wanted to look forward. But 20+ years later, this film is a moving and accurate depiction of what life was like for ordinary, educated people slowly being crushed by The System.",

      "reviewBody": "The biggest problem I&apos;ve always had with French films is that they sometimes propose some really outrageous and thought-provoking ideas, but then they get hampered down in self-indulgence and pretentiousness.\n\nBunker Palace Hotel is one such film.\n\nThe first 15 minutes starts REALLY strong, and it&apos;s a captivating, visually engrossing setup with almost no dialogue. You just have to watch, pay attention, and attempt to understand what&apos;s unfolding. The unmatched cinematography and top-notch composition sets the mood with an almost steampunk-Gothic aesthetic.\n\nIt&apos;s truly remarkable, and it&apos;s not something you see in films often (save for maybe the similarities found in the Goth diesel-punk aesthetic of Tim Burton&apos;s 1989 Batman, which came out the same year as this film).\n\nIn any case, once the remarkable visuals and architecture of the story begin to wear off, you find that the actual plot of the film meanders -- nay! It grinds to an actual halt about halfway through. A story that could have been told in half the time is stretched out to pad the runtime until we get to a philosophically intriguing, yet deflated ending.\n\nIf judging the film on the merits of the first half and the last ten minutes or so, I would give it an easy 8. However, the film is more than just the parts, but the sum of its parts and unfortunately the middle section just didn&apos;t do anything or go anywhere.\n\nNeat ideas about automatons, deceit, elites hiding away while the world crumbles, and lots of political intrigue are kind of swept all by the wayside for pretension. It kind of vacuums all of the tension and interest out of the film because not only does nothing really happen, but the characters don&apos;t really say anything important, either.\n\nIf maybe the second half was filled with more exposition about how and why the world got to the way it was, and having characters argue their stances on which way was the right way, it could have padded out the runtime and also given viewers more insight into what was happening.\n\nInstead, there&apos;s just a lot of circular banter that goes nowhere, and unfortunately Clara has almost no initiative nor agency to drive the plot forward. Worse yet is that she&apos;s not that interesting a character, yet most of the events revolve around her.\n\nThere&apos;s another character that is also introduced with a much more intriguing backstory but we don&apos;t get to learn much about him, and the way the whole thing resolves itself is kind of... disappointing, to say the least.\n\nIn any case, it&apos;s still an intriguing film with a fascinating premise and a lot of interesting sci-fi elements. The ups and downs make it difficult to rate evenly, and I imagine the score it has is due to the people who love it giving it a 10 and the people who hate it something under a 5. I feel I&apos;m generous and evenhanded enough to give it a 6.\n\nStill, when it comes to French sci-fi, Immortal (2004) is still my number one pick. It contains a lot of the typical French self-indulgence, but has a plot that scurries along at a quickened pace despite the lengthy runtime, and has lots of action, intrigue and twists and turns you don&apos;t see coming. Even still, if you&apos;ve already seen Immortal and need more retro French sci-fi in your life, Bunker Palace Hotel isn&apos;t a bad way to spend 90 minutes or so.",

Three childhood friends (Seth Green, Matthew Lilard, Dax Sheppard) reunite at a friend&apos;s funeral, and go off on a camping trip downstream to try and find the lost treasure they always dreamed of finding in their youth in his honour. They promptly and predictably fall into all sorts of mishaps in the wild and really give a bad reputation to man&apos;s survival ethic.\n\nThis kind of comedy is always somewhat stifled when a life lesson is included: in the case of Without a paddle the message is &apos;Appreciate the life you have...you never know how long it will last&apos;. Unfortunately, we go to a film like this to be entertained, not for morals, and its inclusion merely deters from the fun.\n\nThe three leads are what make the film decently funny: Seth Green is excellent as he begrudgingly reveals his various phobias from everything from the dark to ceran wrap. (&apos;I&apos;m afraid it might get stuck over my head, it&apos;s very sticky) Matthew Lilard puts his wide range of comic facial expressions to good use, and Dax Shepard is always a source of laughs as the tough-guy slacker of the group. \n\nThe comedic material is mostly original stuff, but there&apos;s nothing outstanding to be seen, apart from a few memorable moments. (one finds Dax Shepard riding his motorcycle into the graveyard at the burial of his friend, and bellowing out to the funeral attendees &apos;Where did you guys park?&apos;) The inclusion of Burt Reynolds&apos; crazy mountain man is a comedic plus, but the nature loving hippy-girls and uncouth drug traffickers which pop up periodically aren&apos;t as funny as they should be. In fact, such can be said for the entire movie. \n\nThe odd laugh will definitely turn up, but there are many better comedies around, so unless you&apos;re simply up for an evening of mostly forgettable fun, you might want to leave Without a Paddle wallowing in the shallows.\n\n6.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "To me, the best movie Jan Verheyen ever made was &quot;alles moet weg&quot;. Simply brilliant. And what about this one ? Well, it had almost immediatly my interest, because it was a thriller. When the movie was over, I thought it wasn&apos;t bad. And it isn&apos;t. The acting is good, some moments are really frightning and we saw a new actress here: Hilde De Baerdemaker. She has one of the main roles in this movie and she does that very well. The weak points of the movie? Well, the ending is a bit to cheap, it looked like Verheyen hadn&apos;t much time left and why does he always put those freaky sex scenes in his movies? OK, I&apos;m not extremely catholic and I have nothing against sex or nudity or beautiful women, but in every movie Verheyen uses some &quot;hardcore sex&quot; That really sucks. Also, some people said it was &quot;the most scary movie that they&apos;d ever seen&quot;. Well, not exactly... It IS scary, but it&apos;s no &quot;silence of the lambs&quot; or &quot;de lift&quot;, made in the Netherlands, by the way. My final opinion: not bad at all, but due to the ending &amp; some stupid scenes, who think they&apos;re scary, this movie is not a masterpiece. But, this is belgian made, for our country it&apos;s allright. With a larger budget, this would&apos;ve been better than &quot;de lift&quot;. Nice try.",

The film is very slow, and while this can work and be beneficial to the plot, I think that it dragged on far too long in this instance. There was a lot going on visually, which made up for the slowness to a degree, but it seemed as if there was too much time to take it all in. I felt myself noticing the same things over and over in various shots/scenes, because there wasn&apos;t anything else to do besides look, which made me feel like I was staring at the film more so than actually watching it.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, I am a fan of some of the artists on it (Boris, Sunn, Earth, etc.), which is part of the reason I wanted to see this film initially. Because these bands can have a very slow, droney sound, I was very interested to see how the mood of the music would work with the tone of the film. I expected the two to compliment each other, but instead, the soundtrack just made everything drag on. Because the film progressed as such a slow pace, I assumed that it was leading up to a grand climax, but the film&apos;s culmination barely stood out.\n\nI will say that I admired the film from a technical aspect, and I enjoyed seeing some familiar faces from Jarmusch&apos;s earlier work, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever watch it again."

During one devil may care drive home fuelled with excess, they crash into a tree and are instantly killed, yet strangely their spirits are still on earth, and it would seem they need to achieve something of value before they can hit the big house in the sky. Enter regimental prig Cosmo Topper, a friend and colleague of the Kerby&apos;s, and someone who is about to become their pet make over project!\n\nBased on Thorne Smith&apos;s novel, &quot;The Jovial Ghosts&quot;, this is a truly delightful picture, it steams along at a fair old clip, and clocking in at just one and half hours in length, it never outstays its welcome. It would have been very sad if this had become a one joke movie, I mean just how many ghost gags can you pull off before it gets tiresome? Thankfully the makers of this breezy romp have pulled it all together to consistently tickle the ribs. The spooky effects for 1937 certainly hold up well, for sure they are far from perfect, but with the tone of this particular piece being one of mirth and cheekiness, one finds that the effects carry a decidedly uplifting charm.\n\nThe film boasts a wonderful turn from Roland Young as Cosmo Topper, as he lurches from one incredulous situation to another, he carries the film with consummate ease. As the Kerby&apos;s we get the bright Constance Bennett and the irrepressible comic talent of Cary Grant, with Bennett only bagging the role of Marion when the already cast Jean Harlow sadly passed away a month before the shoot. Grant stepped into the role of George after W.C. Fields vacated it, and we can only guess what sort of picture we would have got with the original cast choices. Yet I simply can&apos;t envisage the film being improved upon because Grant &amp; Bennett literally do bounce of each other with cracking results.\n\nFrom one spooky set up to the next, Topper is a cure for the blues, be it fisticuffs with cops, or turning a hotel inside out, it is quite simply a delicious piece of 30s comedy pie. 8/10",

One is a 10 -year old girl named Devon (Mischa Barton) whose parents want her to be the perfect little daughter. She&apos;d rather live in her own world, one in which she entertains herself with her favorite fairy tale of the child-menacing witch, Baba Yaga. The other is a twentysomething yard worker named Trent (Sam Rockwell), who is treated in this paranoid community almost like a black South African under apartheid, i.e. get in, do you work and get out.\n\nBoth of them display their non-conformist behavior early on. She climbs out her bedroom window to her roof, takes off her nightgown and watches it magically float away into the night sky. He stops on his way home from work on a one-lane bridge, blocking the traffic, and proceeds to disrobe and take a leap into the river below. Devon gets interested in him, especially after she witnesses his blatant and subtle humiliation at a neighborhood cookout, where he&apos;s come to get paid for some work. She more or less stalks him at his mobile home, even spying on him making love to one of the community&apos;s young women, a girl who will barely acknowledge him otherwise. Trent tries to shoo Devon away at first, but he can&apos;t help but be flattered by the young girl&apos;s interest.\n\nOf course the potential for misunderstanding in this kind of relationship is great and it inevitably happens. I feared that the movie was about to fly apart after Devon&apos;s father and some others confronted Trent, but the fantastic ending (fantastic in the sense of fantasy) made me smile. If you are looking for something different, this movie definitely qualifies.",

      "reviewBody": "Before writing this review I took a quick look at Wikipedia and the article they have on the Seabees. Despite the fanciful story that Borden Chase wrote here about how the service was founded, the Seabees were actually an idea already thought of by Admiral Ben Morreell the Chief of Navy Supply even before Pearl Harbor. \n\nUnlike the war in Europe where the Allies would be looking to take an hold cities with facilities already there, like air fields for example, those planning the war in the Pacific knew that they would be starting from scratch. Airfields, fuel depots, etc. would have to be constructed on jungle islands in the Pacific. So the idea of a separate service for the construction trade was born.\n\nNow that we know that the plot of The Fighting Seabees is so much hogwash, let me say that what the film does do very well is show the hazards of what the men in that service faced. Trying to build facilities at the same time as the enemy is firing on them. The scenario in this film is repeated many times over on the islands of the Pacific.\n\nAs to the story of this film, John Wayne reverses roles here. In most of his war films he&apos;s usually the professional military man, here he&apos;s the tough, but inpatient civilian who never seems to learn the value of military discipline. Of course being this is the Duke, he does redeem himself in the end in a spectacular manner.\n\nA love triangle is tossed in here, rather unnecessarily in my opinion, a straightforward account of Seabee heroism would have been sufficient. Wayne and Navy Commander Dennis O&apos;Keefe are both interested in war correspondent Susan Hayward. This was Hayward&apos;s second film with John Wayne, who along with Clark Gable, and Dean Martin, she once described as her three favorite leading men. Her big scene is when she&apos;s wounded and thinks she&apos;s cashing in, she declares her love for the Duke. Susan Hayward has always been a favorite of mine, but it&apos;s on the strength of her performances in her starring roles in the Fifties, not as the sex object in The Fighting Seabees.\n\nThe Fighting Seabees isn&apos;t one of the Duke&apos;s top 10 or even top 20, but it&apos;s a decent enough film to sit through even with the World War II heroic bravado that was obligatory at the time this was made. You even get to see John Wayne attempt the jitterbug. During that scene, the Duke looks mighty uncomfortable. He was never going to compete with Fred Astaire for roles.",

      "reviewBody": "After buying a mysterious painting, a man determined to prove it&apos;s the same as his previous wife starts to become aware of the strange incidents surrounding his family when his grandmother begins to show signs of being possessed by her spirit to carry out an act of revenge for her untimely death.\n\nThere&apos;s quite a lot to enjoy in the film. What makes this one quite fun is the rather fun storyline that provides a densely-plotted tale of old-school ghostly revenge. The initial incidents make this feel like a series of strange events surrounding a mysterious painting and the continued sightings of his seemingly long-dead first wife running around the community. As time goes on, it gradually becomes clear that the events are based on a form of revenge from beyond the grave as his first wife is slowly revealed to have been the culprit of a conniving conspiracy involving his family. That the truth comes about rather slowly with the revelations coming out in the latter half involving what really happened gives this a strong overall feel. Combined with a strong visual flair that helps to make the scares look somewhat surreal at times in addition to the steady plot, there&apos;s quite a lot to like here. On top of this, the film manages to incorporate quite a bit of strong action throughout. The opening encounter in the art gallery is a solid setpiece with the desolate exhibit space, eerie ghost laughter in the distance, and the startling effect of the painting&apos;s face melting in front of him which all starts the film on a strong note and gets everything set up for later. Likewise, the confrontation with the painter that results in the ghost returning to settle the score with him, he getting framed for the murder, and leading to a chase through the countryside that uncovers her body buried in a secret basement has some thrilling moments. The first scenes of the ghost tormenting the family, from the encounter at the waterfalls to snatching the daughter out of the bedroom under the mother&apos;s eye, are quite startling and eerie enough to shock as well. This leads to more fun with the possessed grandmother trying to tear the family apart using the ghost as an instrument to help facilitate her plans. Realizing that the ghost has taken hold through a generally impressive setup that involves the grandmother acting out of character provides this one with some fun sequences. While starting with the licking of the sleeping children, it soon delves into more fully-fledged genre ideas including commanding several cats to attack his wife and eventually overpowers her, the frantic hissing and incessant cat-like grooming that takes place whenever no one is observing her, and the fantastic confrontation in her room. This sequence brings about her unnatural behavior including jumping onto the ceiling, turning her limbs into a cat, and eventually transforming into the cat demon that was possessing her all along for a rather shocking encounter. With a full-on finale that includes the big battle with the ghost and getting to understand her need for revenge, this section ends everything on a fine note. There isn&apos;t much wrong here but the film does have some issues. One of the only real issues is the downward spike in momentum this goes through in the second half. Rather than carrying on with the established tempo and mood that had been at play until that point, this one drops instead into a prolonged backstory on her reasoning to become a ghost. This melodrama-heavy backstory focusing on the initial circumstances that brought about this ghostly origin story that delves deep into infidelity, forbidden lust, and deception is placed at the wrong point in the running time and brings about the other issue in the rather formulaic ghost-revenge storyline at play here. Dozens of other efforts have come out taking this storyline involving a ghost taking revenge for their death as a setup for their own work since so it can feel quite familiar. Beyond that, though, there&apos;s not much to dislike here.\n\nToday&apos;s Rating/PG-13: Language and Violence.",

This happens to be one of the few movies that can successfully balance comedy and suspense and come out a winner. \n\nThe plot isn&apos;t easily spotted and old Hitchcock&apos;s influence are apparent, but the film feels completely original. Hawn is just wonderful here, Chase in his best ever role but Dudley Moore steals the show as a...well, likable pervert. The Bee Gees song Stayin&apos; Alive will probably best be remembered here, rather than in Saturday Night Fever. You&apos;ll know when you see it. \n\nHighly recommended.",

Therefore, I came away disappointed at the screen treatment with Liz Taylor (beautiful but shallow), Montgomery Clift (beautiful but shallow) and poor Shelley Winters looking like a drab little wren. An air of artificiality hangs over every scene, every slow-moving scene, and only increases by the time the story arrives at the courtroom climax where an unrestrained Raymond Burr is allowed to chew the scenery. \n\nThis is NOT the great picture everyone always says it is. It&apos;s one of those films that dates badly. Evidently, fans of Liz Taylor and Monty Clift are starry-eyed about their favorite actors and refuse to see the weaknesses in the plodding story and the thinly sketched characters. Elizabeth Taylor had much better roles in her future career (Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, Giant) and Montgomery Clift would make an unforgettable Morris Townsend in The Heiress. Their acting here is as self-conscious as the arty camerawork that frames them in huge romantic close-ups.\n\nThe novel had much more depth and meaning than this watered down version of the story. Read it and you will wonder what all the fuss was about when &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was released. Vastly overrated and noteworthy only for the sincere performance of Shelley Winters and Franz Waxman&apos;s interesting background score."

Supposedly filmed in Riverside, CA, the sets are very interesting as well.\n\nThe print I saw held up very well. Color still popped.\n\nThis is the only movie the director ever made. He started it as a student film. Apparently th film did not do well when released but in recent years it has become a cult item.\n\nGadley also edited a student film of George Lucas. That&apos;s it. Sad there is not more information about him. He clearly was in school to get into the picture business and made an interesting first film, yet nothing exists about him. \n\nAt the time I write this IMDb user are giving this an average of 2.2 stars! That&apos;s a disconnect. It&apos;s definitely way better than that.",

      "reviewBody": "Francois Mitterrand was a fascinating political figure. The journalist Antoine Moreau, constantly interviewing the ailing President during the last months of his premiership and life, finds him fascinating and charismatic. The film is fascinated by him - Michel Bouquet&apos;s Mitterrand dominates all scenes he is in, controlling the conversation, the centre of attention, revelling in his role as the last great president (his argument is that in the age of globalization greatness will no longer be possible for French presidents - and, looking at his followers, he seems to have a point). The fascination of Mitterrand is that he is full of contradictions: the Left wing president who lives in palatial grandeur; the Left winger (we see him addressing workers, speaking of victories achieved through solidarity; and we see his final New Year&apos;s address as he argues that material wealth and growth is not important in itself, but as a means for a more equitable and fairer society - what leader would argue such utopian stuff now, just 20 years on?) who has moved to the Right, but French society has moved quicker than he has so he still seems of the Left; the canny political manoeuvrer who is cultured, loves literature, ideas and life. As well as being a significant political figure, Mitterrand was interesting as a person in a way that Bush or Blair or Sarkozy or Berlusconi are not. Yet, in a way, the film just presumes our interest. If you are not interested in Mitterrand, or have not really heard of him, then I am unsure that the film will gain your attention. I don&apos;t think there are any great insights of character or history here, no detailed study of a political operator - we are just asked to wonder at and about the President. Perhaps characteristically, there is a lot of questioning about Mitterrand&apos;s role during the War, his role in the collaborationist Vichy government, yet, in the end, no conclusion is reached. The narrative centre of the film is Moreau and he is given a life outside of his fascination with Mitterrand: his relationship with his partner breaks down, he meets another woman - but this is all a bit flat, it only gains significance when it connects with Moreau&apos;s relationship with the President. I liked this film, I found it interesting, but I think that was because I find its subject interesting - if you don&apos;t share my interest then I am unconvinced that the film will hold your attention. In a way the film is part of a Mitterrand cult rather than an exploration of it.",

      "reviewBody": "Danny Huston is Orson Welles in &quot;Fade to Black,&quot; a 2006 release, directed by Oliver Parker, and featuring Paz Vega, Diego Luna, Christopher Walken, Anna Galiena, and Nathaniel Parker.\n\nIn this story, Welles goes to Italy after his divorce from Rita Hayworth to make a film, &quot;Black Magic.&quot; He also wants to raise money for his film version of &quot;Othello.&quot; While in Italy, one of the actors in the film is murdered, and as he&apos;s dying, he whispers the word &quot;Nero&quot; in Orson&apos;s ear. Welles intends to find out who killed him. But he finds himself not only involved with shady characters, but embroiled in the politics of the country. As time goes on, he begins to hear different stories about the actor, somewhat contradictory in nature. On top of which, Tyrone Power is a much bigger star in Italy and Welles keeps coming up short, except on a hit list!\n\nThis is a nice blend of fact and fiction. Welles did go to Europe around this time, and he made several films, which he often did when he was trying to get money together. His marriage to Rita Hayworth was a complicated one. When his political ambitions led nowhere in the &apos;40s, Rita, so desperate to get out of show business, turned to Aly Khan instead. Welles adored her, but her insecurities made her difficult to live with and was a bad combination with his egotism.\n\nIt&apos;s doubtful that Welles would have gotten himself mixed up in anything that didn&apos;t somehow lead to his own self-aggrandizement, but I could have gone along with it if the script had been better. It tries to cram in too much plot.\n\nItaly after the war was a horrific mess. The production values for &quot;Fade to Black&quot; are wonderful and show the post-war ruination, as well as striking differences between rich and poor. Of course, Cinecitta the film studio is in Rome, and Tombolo, the place where deserters and collaborators escaped, is way up north, though it&apos;s not clear if they&apos;re speaking of a district or the city. In any event, it&apos;s a wooded area seemingly not far from Rome. The word tombolo has more to do with a mound or beach, so the woods would be the name for it.\n\nDanny Huston doesn&apos;t look or sound like Welles, except on the film that plays behind his magic act - there we see him in the typical Welles big overcoat and hat, in black and white. He does a good job, though I do believe Welles was a bit showier. As the mother and daughter who knew the murdered actor, Paz Vega and Anna Galiena are gorgeous and look just like mother and daughter. Both have a mysterious aura which adds to the film.\n\nThe denouement is no surprise. Still, this is an enjoyable film about one of Hollywood&apos;s most electrifying people, a brilliant maverick with a flamboyant personality. Sadly, though he resented the discipline and structure dictated by a Hollywood studio, he needed it. Once he left, he was never the same.",

Writer and journalist Kurt Tucholsky is trying to evade the growing political and legal pressure aimed against his pacifist activism by taking some vacation together with his girlfriend Lydia. Together they spend some happy days in Gripsholm Castle, Sweden. Although a visit by his old pal Karl who has turned into a Nazi admirer temporarily reminds him of the unpleasant changes that take place back home, he finds distraction in comfy country life, in caring for an unfortunate runaway child and erotic adventures together with Lydia and Billie, a Berlin variété singer. Ultimately his attempt to evade reality lead into exile and isolation. Although quite conventional and ultimately predictable in its making, the film succeeds in depicting the dilemma of German intellectuals in exile. A beautiful soundtrack and excellent acting are additional assets.",

      "name": "early German western, of historical interest",
      "reviewBody": "Made in 1963, this may well have been following up on the success of the first Winnetou-Shatterhand film, as there is a scene between star Hansjorg Felmy and his Indian chief friend that plays a lot like Lex Barker and Pierre Brice. In any event, Brad Harris is not the main hero here(and in this English version, his last name is NOT Cook--in fact, his last name is written in the sand at one point, so it can&apos;t be cook in the German version either!), but a young man accused of a killing he didn&apos;t commit. Horst Frank is once again convincing as a snivelling, oily crook, Colonel Kelly, a disgraced former military officer. Frank tries to deceive the local Indians and turn them against the local white population, and he also organizes the &quot;pirates&quot; of the title. While lacking the sweep and grandeur and the beauty of the &quot;Old Shatterhand&quot; series, and featuring an &quot;oom-pah&quot; musical score that conjurs up nothing West of Bonn or Stuttgart, the film is of historical interest because it pre-dates FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and thus the filmmakers were not working in a well-established tradition. It also features second-unit direction from Gianfranco Parolini, who would later pair up Brad Harris and Tony Kendall (here also in a small role) in many successful action films. Parolini&apos;s colorful, eccentric, circus-like style is briefly in evidence here and there, as in some action scenes we see movement at different depths within the frame, but there&apos;s not enough of his oddball touches to give the film much of the &quot;Frank Kramer&quot; style. Overall, if you have watched dozens of Eurowesterns and enjoyed the Winnetou series, you&apos;ll find this interesting as a historical curio. And Brad Harris fans will enjoy him in his first Eurowestern role. There&apos;s probably no need for anyone else to seek this out--if you haven&apos;t seen a German western before, watch one of the Lex Barker or Stewart Granger films based on Karl May novels instead. Fortunately, the copy of this film floating around is letterboxed, although it&apos;s a grainy PAL transfer.",

The film suffers from not having John Belushi, but John Goodman puts in a good effort, and I for one was surprised at the quality of his singing. James Brown and Aretha Franklin reprise their guest roles. The music is not as good as the original but still better than most music in the charts these days.\n\nThe humour from the original is here but it is not as funny as the original. In fact all elements from the original are here in slightly inferior forms, with the exception of the car chase, which is better.\n\nTo be honest, it is worth seeing this film just to see how all the band has aged. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Blues music, though fans of the original may be disappointed",

There is so much crap being made that people seem to love, and when something really good and original comes along people don&apos;t care about it. This movie touches on the theme of vampires, but it&apos;s not your ordinary vampire movie. It&apos;s a vampire movie with a twist. It is set in what looks like a somewhat futuristic &quot;Jack the ripper era London&quot; type of environment. This is beautifully done. Movies that come to mind are Sherlock Holmes, Bram Stokers Dracula and Wolfman. If you like those movies, you should find this movie interesting. You don&apos;t have to be a vampire buff to like this movie since it&apos;s not really a vampire movie, as much as it is a Sherlock Holmes type of suspense thriller where the murderer just happens to be a vampire. This movie is high-end quality filmmaking. It looks far more expensive than what the budget would suggest. The casting and acting is superb. The cinematography, editing, directing, visual effects...everything is superbly done. The story in this movie is even interesting and could have opened up to a number of sequels if this movie wasn&apos;t so poorly received (for reasons I don&apos;t understand). Anyone who found Sherlock Holmes interesting are advised to give this movie a chance.",

Antonio realizes he has to act fast to secure his position and therefore stages a pagan festival, where his lustful friends shall dispose of Rosa&apos;s desires once and for all \n\nMany of director Salvatore Sampieri&apos;s works deal with impossible sexual or romantic fulfillment. And he is known for his biting satiric stance on bourgeoisie, old-school social conventions and similar class-conceit. All these ingredients are present in &quot;Casta e pura&quot;, but it is just played out too simply. There is a bunch of random buffoons hanging around Antonio&apos;s villa, all deranged, incestuous, greedy and whatnot. Antonio is of course the worst, kidding his daughter for twenty years, always pretending the vow is for her own good. The contrast to the only &quot;unspoilt&quot; person, Rosa, comes out way too extreme to take any of these characters seriously – in the end the satiric elements serve for cheap jokes only. Speaking of Rosa, she is truly &quot;chaste and pure&quot;, but the general setup feels very far-fetched and the situations the screenplay puts her in are just repetitive, be it the confessions, the lame gags with her dropping dishes, or not less than three nightly gatherings with the greedy cook. You can understand Rosa&apos;s misery and bitter situation, but the character remains shallow. Laura Antonelli&apos;s very own &quot;Mio Dio, come sono caduta in basso&quot; (1974) showed perfectly how to build up a story on a similarly awkward premise, and managed to be funny throughout. &quot;Casta e pura&quot; unfortunately fails.\n\nThe big turning point, the weird pagan party, is quite a disappointment as well. Resembling the Roman rape of the Sabine Women, the editing is very choppy (in two occasions we see Rosa nude, but after a cut, she is dressed again, plus rough music jumps). Of course the cruelty of the father and his friends is now pushed to the top. Now we suddenly get a rape-and-revenge situation with a very serious rape and a slapstick revenge afterwards. At this point the screenplay collapses completely and the whole payback stuff is just contrived. Rosa is suddenly like new-born, stone cold and will give everybody the just desserts. I was glad when it was over.\n\nLaura Antonelli, while being absolutely wonderful to behold (sometimes even in the nude), is a little too old for the role (she was 39 by then), and I must say her performance leaves something to be desired. However, in view of the simple screenplay and the lack of any other remarkable actor, it is okay. The &quot;rural&quot; Italian dialect by some of the characters is very hard to understand, so I can&apos;t rule out I missed some hidden gags.\n\nOverall, there is some general quality to &quot;Casta e pura&quot;, one you can expect from a renowned director like Sampieri, but the movie never gets momentum owing to a lackluster screenplay and overly simple characterizations.",

Lame acting, worse dialogue (written by a former soft-core porn screenwriter), plot holes aplenty, and lackadaisical direction and editing. Many scenes are wide angle master-shots with no real framing, as the actors just meander on screen and recite their lines of dialogue. The plot is not very fact based considering it claims to be inspired by true events, it deviates from the facts of the case almost from square one. It seems like the screenwriters were not even familiar with the case when they wrote the screenplay. An interesting movie could have been made out of the story, but they did just about everything wrong here. And I did not know that people had laptop computers and cell phones with text messaging and photos in the 1970s?",

Unlike other directors though, Agnes never makes it feel pretentious and never disrespects the subject. She takes great care and has fun with the audience in the process."

      "reviewBody": "This legendary tale of a woman who briefly ascended to the papal throne may be set in the ninth century, but its themes and its subject matter is as relevant now as it was before. In fact, the German-made, English-language &quot;Pope Joan&quot; arrives at a time when the Catholic Church is once again facing calls to allow women to be ordained priests- especially since in the wake of the recent paedophilia scandal in Europe, some point the cause to the Church&apos;s insistence on a male, celibate priesthood.\n\nAdapted from the bestseller by Donna Woolfolk Cross, the legend of Pope Joan goes that said woman posed as a man to enter the Benedictine monastery and rose to the favour of the previous pope due to her great intellect and learning. Yet after a reign of a few years, she gave birth to a baby during a papal procession and was torn apart by an angry mob. Whether this is fact or fiction is up to you to decide, though this adaptation which begins with a French bishop arriving in Rome to enter Joan&apos;s story in the papal archives wants you to believe its authenticity.\n\nThe bishop&apos;s dictation frames the flow of the movie, which attempts to chronicle the life of Joan right from the time of her difficult birth to a fundamentalist village priest (Iain Glen) and his Saxon wife (Joerdis Triebel) to the time of her death in front of the Roman crowds. Even from a young age, we learn that Joan possessed extraordinary wisdom and an insatiable crave for knowledge. So despite her misogynistic father&apos;s opposition to girls receiving any form of education, she picks up reading and writing and even Scripture itself.\n\nThese early years are presented with a bleakness and austerity that effectively, if manipulatively, gets the audience&apos;s sympathies firmly with Joan. As her father makes Joan watch him physically abuse her mother for not objecting to Joan&apos;s learning of Scripture, and then whips her severely for what he perceives as a grievous offence, it&apos;s hard not to root for the brilliant and bright Joan to break free from the chains of her father&apos;s misogyny.\n\nBut that liberation is not to come till much later, even as the chance visit of a religious teacher marks her initiation into the religious life. Together with her brother Johannes, Joan is sent to study under the bishop of Dorstadt where she meets Gerold (David Wenham), a knight whom the teenage Joan slowly falls in love with. After the invading Norse army ambushes their village while Gerold is away, Joan binds her breasts and trims her hair, beginning her impersonation as her brother Johannes by joining the Fulda Abbey.\n\nUnfolding at a brisk pace, director Soenke Wortmann (of the German hit &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot;) deftly keeps the proceedings taut and the tension palpable, as Joan takes care to conceal her identity. When at the brink of being discovered, Joan journeys to Rome where she is first appointed as a physician to Pope Sergius (John Goodman) and slowly grows to become his personal adviser. After he is murdered by his own courtiers, Joan is chosen by the people of Rome as his successor, her election as Pope a carefully calculated sweet triumph for its audience.\n\nYet it&apos;s not nearly enough for Joan to be Pope, her chance meeting with Gerold igniting her feelings for him and their eventual coupling resulting in her pregnancy. This reviewer must admit first and foremost that this turn of events didn&apos;t sit with his personal convictions too well- not for the fact that Pope Joan was female, but for her blatant disregard of the Church&apos;s understanding of celibacy. Bearing in mind she was firstly ordained and secondly unwed, should Pope Joan have given in to her feelings and consummated with Gerold? Would such an intelligent woman have acted so callously with little regard of the inevitable consequences? Where art thou would she command any moral authority as the head of the Church? Of course, such is the controversial nature of the legend that has remained hugely debated over the years, but it is inevitable that some audiences will find the material troubling. Nonetheless, it isn&apos;t less of a film just because it has chosen to tackle a topic of such divisive nature. Rather, lead actress Johanna Wokalek anchors the movie with an emotionally rousing performance portraying Joan&apos;s steeliness and vulnerability in equal measure. Best known for her roles in Til Schweiger&apos;s Barfuss and Uli Edel&apos;s The Baader Meinhof Complex, Wokalek not only looks the part, but plays it with gusto and aplomb.\n\nYet it&apos;s easy to overlook Wokalek&apos;s brilliant acting in the film because of its subject matter which, as this reviewer has pointed out, remains as relevant today and therefore disputatious. It&apos;s best therefore that one approaches this with an open mind, and if necessary, a piece of fiction- for you will discover that this handsomely mounted historical epic is riveting and rousing from start to finish.",

      "name": "A Unique and Original Film With Outstanding Acting",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s silly to berate a movie that hasn&apos;t even come out. Having read the book, and been down the road of chronic depression for many months, I have to disagree with the first preview that claims this movie unworthy because of the image Wurtzel gives us of depression. Depression, sorry to burst Violetta&apos;s bubble, it a unique, personal hard fought battle for evey individual who suffers from it. That just happened to be Wurtzel&apos;s experience with her own depression. Needless to say I give the book my highest rating and hope to do the same with the movie. Prozac Nation was one of those movies I wanted to see as soon as I heard about it. I have seen the trailer a few times and couldn&apos;t wait for the film to be released into theaters. It was at first in limited release, which I don&apos;t understand why since it is a mainstream movie but anyway it finally arrived to my local theater today. So as soon as I could I rushed to the theater to see Prozac Nation.\n\nThe movie&apos;s plot is very simple but at the same time very complex, Lizzie played by the beautiful and talented Christina Ricci is a depressed girl. Following up his critically acclaimed debut Insomnia (1997), Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjaerg makes his first English-language feature with this adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth Wurtzel. Christina Ricci stars as Lizzie, a prize-winning student heading off to Harvard where she intends to study journalism and launch a career as a rock music critic. However, Elizabeth&apos;s fractured family situation including an errant father (Nicholas Campbell) and a neurotic, bitterly hypercritical mother (Jessica Lange) has led to a struggle with depression. When her all-night, drug-fueled writing binges and emotional instability alienate her roommate and best friend, Ruby (Michelle Williams), as well as both her first (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and second (Jason Biggs) boyfriends, Lizzie seeks psychiatric counseling from Dr. Diana Sterling (Anne Heche), who prescribes the wonder drug Prozac. Despite success as a writer that includes a gig writing for Rolling Stone and some mellowing out thanks to her medication, Lizzie begins to feel that the pills are running her life and faces some tough choices about her future. Prozac Nation (2001) is a longtime dream project of star Ricci, who also serves as one of the film&apos;s co-producers. Prozac Nation then starts to develop into an unusual and original movie, which I for one have never seen before. A lot of symbolism, terrific acting, and a lot of dark past scenes ensue.\n\nIn this film I really could not believe the acting. It was terrific all around. Christina Ricci proves that she can hold a lead role and do it flawlessly. Her role was perfect and involved a lot of different emotions, which she played off like a natural. But Christina Ricci&apos;s acting isn&apos;t the highlight of this film, that award goes to Jessica Lange who plays her role like she actually was going though this in real life. Her incredible acting kept getting stronger throughout the entire film. The supporting actors and actresses were all good as well. Michelle Williams who played Ruby, was really good in her role. Emily Perkins who played Ellen was very good as well as Anne Heche who played the doctor Sterling.\n\nThe film&apos;s script was another strong point. It was very good! I never knew what was going to happen next. I thought I did a few times but I was wrong. The script also had a lot of symbolism in it and if you watch the movie closely you will be able to catch it. I also like how the movie didn&apos;t have the typical Hollywood ending at the end. It was very different and I didn&apos;t expect what happened to happen. The writer, Galt Niederhoffer did a great job and surprisingly this was his second film. I wish I could shake this man&apos;s hand for making such a great piece of cinema. I am really looking forward to his next movie Lonesome Jim that comes out in 2005. I loved the director&apos;s use of camera angles and the many views of various landscapes and the sky. It was very creative.\n\nSo what else can I say about the film, it was very independent like which I am sure will turn the normal moviegoers off right away. The movie moves slowly to build its story and suspense. It does this flawlessly. It&apos;s really amazing. If you want a great movie that has an unusual and original story, great acting and lots of hidden messages and symbolism then go see Prozac Nation and enjoy. If you don&apos;t like movies that make you think then skip this one because it&apos;s not for you. It was a terrific film from a great new director.I&apos;ve been looking forward to seeing Prozac Nation since I first saw the poster for the film. The poster itself seemed rather amusing and then when I had seen the trailer for the film and wanted to watch the film even more. I usually enjoy Christina Ricci on the big screen. She is definitely a great actress. Lots of clever dialog, great acting, and a unique story ensue.\n\nThe acting in the film was top notch. I think Christina Ricci&apos;s performance was very noteworthy. I liked her character. Lizzie was nice girl who was very sweet and innocent. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance was another great role for his resume. I liked how his character had many sides to him. I felt they all played their characters well.\n\nI think what is amazing about the script is the fact that a. the writer never wrote a film anything like it before and b. it&apos;s a very original film. I know I haven&apos;t seen every movie but I never seen a movie like this. The story was unique, the characters were likable, and the dialog was rather clever. I applaud these two screenwriters for their effort on the script. Sadly I doubt the movie will do well. There was only three people in the theater counting me and the story is rather odd and original so I don&apos;t know if it will really trigger much interest from the typical moviegoers.\n\nErik Skjoldbjærg was the director of Prozac Nation. I have not seen his movies Insomnia yet but I&apos;ll watch it as soon as I can get my paws on it. I liked how in the film, Erik Skjoldbjærg really captured being in Harvard and being depressed, showing everyone in the opening scene of the film. It really lets you know how life is for Lizzie. The director also did a good job of directing the actors and making them connect. I really felt for the characters in this film. I liked that they had this great connection with each other on screen.\n\nSo to summarize, I overall really enjoyed Prozac Nation. The cast is great, as is its story. I feel the film won&apos;t attract much attention since the crap fest wholesome teen movies and sex comedies rule the box office, it&apos;s an indie film and the fact that Prozac Nation itself isn&apos;t aimed at the average moviegoer crowd. I recommend this film though to anyone who wants to see a film that is smart, original and witty. It delivers great performances and some sad moments. I really enjoyed the film and will probably go see it again if I can.  My final rating for Prozac Nation is an 8/10"

I&apos;m not entirely sure why Asner&apos;s character didn&apos;t immediately shave and find a change of clothes to help evade capture but I guess we wouldn&apos;t have had a movie then. And how about that prison? They have the dumbest guards imaginable. Dude just literally walked up to the door and asked to be let out. Still, it&apos;s a good TV movie with nice humor and sentimental touches. Corny at times but appropriately so. Gets better as it goes along so stick with it.",

      "reviewBody": "A gruff old-school reporter (Russell Crowe playing his A-game) becomes personally entangled in a breaking news story surrounding his old college buddy turned congressman (Ben Affleck, not as bad as you would think) and a young female aid who died under mysterious circumstances in the surprisingly plausible political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot; from director Kevin MacDonald who was previously responsible for &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot;. Though designed as a throw-back to paranoid investigative thrillers from the 1970&apos;s, relevance is gained when the massive cover-up revealed becomes a vehicle for the filmmakers to explore the death of print news at the hand of digital mediums.\n\nThe twisty and engaging screenplay is credited to three scribes: Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray. But it&apos;s Gilroy&apos;s fingerprints that shape the story with all the overlapping dialogue and conspiracy talk that will remind many of his &quot;Michael Clayton&quot;. Adapted from a sprawling BBC miniseries created by Paul Abbott, the trio is especially deft in their condensing of the story into a fully digestible two hours. Even as new characters and twists keep coming, the audience is never left out in the cold. They also give the cast plenty to chew on with some great throw-away lines amidst all the posturing between the cops, reporters, politicians and sleaze-bags.\n\nThough it&apos;s Crowe and Helen Mirren as his sparring and quick-witted boss who shine the most, this is essentially an ensemble piece, and it&apos;s especially clever when Jason Bateman arrives on screen for a few pivotal scenes as a smug public relations guru who&apos;s too dumb to realize he knows too much. The cast also includes Robin Wright Penn as Affleck&apos;s wife, Jeff Daniels as the arrogant majority whip and Harry Lennix, who as a D.C. detective makes a compelling case here for the lead role in the Barack Obama Story. The only miscalculation in the casting is poor Rachel McAdams, lovely but annoying in her high-pitch as Crowe&apos;s blogging tag-along looking to kick it old-school and get something in print.\n\nBy the third act &quot;State of Play&quot; overplays its hand in its attempts to be timely with too much talk of the privatization of the military, Capitol Hill sex scandals and traditional newspapers losing out in the digital age to bloggers more concerned with gossip than real journalism. It could&apos;ve also been more subtle in its preaching about the importance of serious investigative reporting. It should be commended, however, for an otherwise smart screenplay that doesn&apos;t spell out all its twists and turns too early and the well polished cast who give the film a slick sheen. Even though it might be reporting on yesterday&apos;s news, &quot;State of Play&quot; still makes for solid rainy day entertainment and is worthy of blogging about.",

      "name": "Violent film about a  killer who returns home  to investigate a familiar crime and meets sleazy character after another",
      "reviewBody": "An excellent noir cinema produced by Michael Caine and very well directed by Mike Hodges ; an extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled &apos;Get Carter&apos; by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (Michael Caine) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer at the town . Magnificent Michael Caine in the title role , he&apos;s a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother&apos;s death by some mobsters . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (Ian Hendry, Mosley) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident , London gangster Jack Carter travels to Newcastle to investigate and meets nasty characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a &quot;gang&quot; opponent led by a mobster (John Osborne) . As he decides to travel his natal Newcastle to investigate who is responsible . This city in northern England is portrayed as a cool place , foggy , sordid , rainy , dirty , gray and industrial aspect . Carter starts moving in this ambient , full of sad pubs , horse races , buildings almost in ruins , piers of black water and ravaged aspect postindustrial , which had almost erased from his memory . While we see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant Londoner gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose, and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and cold killer . All of this ends up in the discovery of X film involving his niece what angry Jack Carter enormously . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in northern England . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment.\n\nThis interesting film features thrills , raw energy ,adult subject matter with abundant nudism , lots of violence and enlivened by high-powered performances . Plenty of intrigue, atmospheric music , kinky sex ,noisy action and grisly killings until impressive finale vengeance . It is a movie very violent , depressing charismatic , magnificently set , but always strong , with a perfect abstraction of a climate of moral misery to game with the cold environment and ramshackle scenarios well photographed by cameraman Wolfgang Suschitzky . Adequate musical score by Roy Budd with a rare mixture , the dark psychedelia of the movement &quot;Northen Soul&quot; , so fashionable in the proletarian clubs from the north of England of the 70s .\n\nThis British 1971 film &quot;GET CARTER¨ is an original movie and is far superior subsequent 1972 remake , a Black Gangster version titled ¨The hit-man¨, a Blaxploitiation movie regularly directed by George Armitage with Bernie Casie , Pam Grier , Roger E Mosley and Paul Gleason . And remade again (2000) by Stephen Kay , in which Las Vegas avenger goes home to Seattle to learn his brother&apos;s death , starred by Silvester Stallone in the title role , Miranda Richardson , Alan Cummings , Mickey Rourke and again Michael Caine at a special appearance .",

I had only the slightest idea of what it was about but it sounded interesting. When I realized it was a caveman movie I almost left, but the beautiful wide screen cinematography kept me in my seat. Slowly it worked on me and by the end I was mesmerized.\n\nThere&apos;s not really much of a plot--the caveman discover fire and different sexual positions--and there&apos;s no dialogue that we could understand but it didn&apos;t matter. The whole cast was excellent--especially Ron Perelman and Rae Dawn Chong (who had guts to do this). Their whole performances had to be done using some foreign language and body movement but they pulled it off. I heard Anthony Burgess was called in to develop the language used and coach the cast in how to use it. The cinematography is just breath-taking and the prehistoric animals look realistic all the way. I can&apos;t exactly say why I loved this movie but I did. \n\n20th Century Fox deserves credit for actually acquiring the film and releasing it. Naturally it bombed badly here in the US but it seems I&apos;m not the only one who likes it--when I mention it to friends I just get a blank look back. I haven&apos;t seen it since 1981 but it&apos;s never left me. Try to see it on a big screen TV. I give it an 8.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen nearly 1,200 movies, and this is my favorite. Not the BEST I&apos;ve ever seen, but my favorite. Former Brooklyn junior high basketball coach-turned-delicatessen manager desperately wants to coach again. A small liberal-arts college in the Nevada desert wants him to build their team from nothing, for a salary of $60 for every game won. With the help of his playground-pickup-game teammate (New York Knick star Bernard King), he scours the streets for five great but undiscovered players. Then they go to Nevada, pick up a freshman quarterback in a school without football, and become an unbeaten sensation. Now the trick is to get nationally-ranked Nevada State (fictitious school filling in for UNLV) to play them in an exhibition game.\n\nThat&apos;s it; that&apos;s the plot. It sounds silly and contrived, like a T.V. sitcom meets an Horatio Alger story. So how come I loved it so much? How come in a list of favorites that includes The Godfather, All the President&apos;s Men, Sunset Boulevard and Rocky, this far lesser story of underdogs overcoming adversity is my greatest pleasure? Four things, I think:  the characters are real, not cardboard cutouts, and they all have very real reasons for leaving New York for Nevada;  Kaplan brings with him his &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot; sensibility for helping young people that everyone else has written off to achieve more than they ever thought possible;  the film contains at least three hysterical AND original scenes, one of which would dubbed an all-time classic if 5 million more people had actually seen this film;  and I&apos;m not a sports fan, but the basketball games in this movie, especially the grand finale, are genuinely exciting. It&apos;s not ever going to make Halliwell&apos;s tome as a genre-defining classic. It may not even make your Saturday night video list. But it should.\n\nBecause it&apos;s real, it&apos;s fun, it&apos;s silly, and unlike more than half of what Hollywood feeds us today, it has a plot that keeps moving from the beginning to the end. And that&apos;s saying a lot.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Chain Reaction&apos; was made by many of the same actors and crew who made the first - and best - &apos;Mad Max&apos; movie. Although the IMDb credits don&apos;t share too many names, the style, photography and direction are so uncannily similar, that George Miller must&apos;ve been more involved with &apos;The Chain Reaction&apos; than just as co-producer. The two films are practically twins. Even the car-chase scenes are alike, which is good.\n\nThe plot could easily serve as a prequel to Mad Max; an accident at an Austrailian nuke disposal site out in the boonies results in catastrophic radiation leakage which will poison the area&apos;s water table. The evil corporation that owns the disposal site is trying to hush up the accident by sealing off the area, but some eco-activists have been in contact with one of the scientists at the site, and they find out about it. The scientist took a huge dose of plutonium during the accident and only has 3 days to live, but hotheaded motorhead dude Larry (played by Steve Bisley - &apos;The Goose&apos; in &apos;Mad Max&apos;) and his wife get tangled up in the unfolding crisis...\n\nMany of the local inhabitants appearing in &apos;The Chain Reaction&apos; also played similar characters in &apos;Mad Max&apos;. They don&apos;t necessarily play the exact same parts, but it is not a stretch to imagine that after the nuclear catastrophe has devastated their environment, they all evolved into the desperate characters of &apos;Mad Max&apos;. \n\nIt appears (to me anyway) that &apos;The Chain Reaction&apos; was filmed first, since one of the characters seems to say &quot;It&apos;s 1977, mate...&quot;, but I&apos;m not quite sure about this. The haircuts and clothes are definitely mid-70&apos;s, (flared jeans etc) while Mad Max has a later, more punkish late-70&apos;s look.",

      "reviewBody": "El Santo, more than any other lucha film hero, seemed to encounter the supernatural at nearly every turn. Well, maybe not quite that regularly, but in a film career then spanned three decades, he confronted more than his share of werewolves, aliens, witches and other strange foes.\n\nIn this early fantasy themed entry (one of four films made in this year), three strangely silent thieves stage a midnight raid on a jewelry shop. During the course of the theft, the night watchman shoots one of the robbers in the forehead, with no apparent effect. The bandits fend off arriving detectives and make their escape -- delivering their loot to a man in a medical tunic and a hood. It seems they are zombies -- revived criminals controlled by this sinister mastermind.\n\nThree detectives (Armando Silvestre, Irma Serrano and Jaime Fernandez)are dispatched to investigate the disappearance of a noted professor who had recently returned from a research trip to Haiti. When the man&apos;s daughter (Lorena Velazquez, who appeared in a number of lucha films -- including a two-film stint as half of the femme wrestling duo, Las Luchadoras) appeals to the authorities for assistance, Silvestre wisely calls on Santo for help.\n\nSanto almost instantly runs afoul of the zombie master. He thwarts the kidnapping of the female of the trio and, later, prevents the zombies from abducting children chosen as experimental subjects, from an orphanage. One particularly bizarre element to the film being that both the madman and Santo can tune each other in on closed circuit television. Santo literally watches as the fiend lays his plans.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to this unwanted meddling (is there ever _wanted_ meddling?), the hooded fiend abducts Santo&apos;s next ring opponent (co-scripter Fernando Oses) and turns him into a killer zombie. The plan unravels when Santo managed to short circuit his control belt.\n\nThe daughter and the detectives of course end up in the madman&apos;s hands, and it&apos;s El Santo to the rescue.\n\nSome nice, gloomy photography is the highlight of an otherwise rather basic film. There&apos;s a particularly nice sequence at the end, when Santo (who generally just rushes off once he&apos;s triumphed) slowly exits up a long and interesting metal staircase set into the madman&apos;s cave. There are some clinker shots, though. There&apos;s a poorly done use of rear projection in an exterior scene, and there&apos;s a downright goofy shot of a partly unmasked Santo goggling in shock at the zombies who had attacked him vanishing in a puff of flame.\n\nStill, it&apos;s a fun early Santo flick, and it is available dubbed in English for those who&apos;re timid about boldly launching into original-language lucha.\n\n7 out of 10."

It does start off slow but then it picks up and you start liking it. In the end it depends a lot on how much you like the 2 main characters and the music. I did like the characters enough to care about them. The music was just OK except one song which was great. \n\nHome is not what I would call a great movie though. You can&apos;t compare it to the likes of Beauty &amp; the Beast, Lion King, Tangled, etc.\n\nMy advice to anyone who is planning to watch Home is to be patient at the start and follow the interactions of the main characters closely. This is a movie about relationships. If you liked Frozen then chances are you will like Home.",

      "reviewBody": "Hong Kong movie was hot in the late &apos;80s, and into the &apos;90s, and this is one of the movies from that era. The casting is unusual, and so is the plot. Jet Li, wasn&apos;t all that well known at the time, and this was Miss Chinese International 1992 Christy Chung&apos;s first big role ( I actually liked the miss Chinese International 92 runner up more than Christy, and she would have been perfect for this role ). \n\nJet Li&apos;s star was on the rise starting around the time this movie was made, and he starts getting noticed in the US around this time also. Simon Yam was briefly wooing Christy shortly after this movie was made. Simon of course had many other options as he was one of the most eligible bachelor in Hong Kong.\n\nThe movie&apos;s title is almost verbatim fact as Jet was from China, and Christy was from Canada. The unusual mixture of the two culture shows in the mood of these two actors. The plot is also unusual in that an operative from China protects a rich capitalist girl. The movie&apos;s background looks more modern than the present day Hong Kong. Hong Kong seems to have slid backwards in culture since its repatriation. This is evident when you see this movie.\n\nSo this is an interesting movie, and the producers at Dimension Film did a really good job of capturing the character of Li, and Chung, and incorporating them into the story. Jet Li is like an unstoppable terminator in this movie, and it correctly highlights his skills, and power.\n\nThis is an excellent movie, and is worth a watch if you&apos;re a Hong Kong movie fan.",

Everyone was criticizing Kenneth Branagh (and John Cusack, to a lesser degree) when they did their Woody impersonations in Celebrity and Bullets Over Broadway.  But no one seemed to mind when Parker did it in this movie, which Woody Allen had no link to even though it feels that way.  Add Mia Farrow to the mix, and the clone is perfected (nevermind the fact that Mia and Woody were estranged when this was made).  I found a few funny moments and lines (the business with the monkeys and Parker&apos;s reaction to them is memorable, but again totally out of the Woody school).  But in the end this is a second-rate Woody Allen film, best suited for rainy days when there is nothing else to watch and you stumble upon this on cable TV."

Most of all, the absolute boredom that permeates this whole movie from start to finish. Yeah, the setting and costumes are accurate, but that doesn&apos;t excuse the previously mentioned boredom of all. There are also a lot of logical inconsistencies and character incongruencies allaround (the princess wishing to her beloved to be safe by sending him to a mission with a million percent of possibility - didn&apos;t someone tell her the odds?! - to die stealing the crown in that regards) that don&apos;t help at all. The final close encounters of the third kind rip-off moment seems also thrown completely at random with no discernible reason other than trying to salvage something not salvageable with a cheap shock twist. And good job on the atrocious special effects, they would make blush crap like Manborg for envy. An absolute inanity of a movie that I don&apos;t recommend to anyone to get through. Avoid with no remorse whatsoever.",

Little did I know sitting down in the cinema about the background stories of this constellation of musicians calling themselves Foo Fighters. Dave Grohl as the obvious front figure, with his friend and bass player Nate Mendel as a constant team member, are taking the viewers on a trip from the Nirvana days up to the recording of Foo Fighters&apos; latest studio album &apos;Wasting Light&apos;.\n\nThe film is humorous, intense, sensitive and enlightening, and with constant sequences of a variety of the group&apos;s musical contributions being showed, a span from intimate rock club gigs to the great Wembley shows in 2008 can be enjoyed. Dave Grohl is giving a lot away from things that affected the band&apos;s development, positive or negative. Interviews are mixed with pieces of songs and live performances. \n\nThis is a perfect warm-up for the up and coming album, that in the cinema was accentuated by the close-to-one-take-shot of a live studio performance, where the band is playing all songs from the newest album in a row, without a crowd or any small talk in between the songs. A perfect end to an amazing documentary.",

      "reviewBody": "The purpose of 8 is to address the agreement of 191 governments to halve world poverty by 2015. These are defined under the following Millennium Development Goals: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger; Achieve Universal Primary Education; Promote Gender Equality; Reduce Child Mortality; Improve Maternal Health; Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other Diseases; Ensure Environmental Sustainability; Global Partnership for Development. At the halfway point towards meeting those goals, the problem doesn&apos;t appear to have drastically altered, and eight filmmakers of international renown have been gathered to examine just how serious the position is.\n\nThe best films in 8 tend to be those that get the point across through simple human stories rather than by adhering too closely to the rather dry themes and statistics. Such is how Gael García Bernal deals with the subject from the surprising location of Iceland in &quot;The Letter&quot;, capturing with simplicity and beautiful cinematography a discussion between a father and his young son, who is working on a school project about the Nepal region, about the impact of the failure of a nation to achieve basic Primary Education. Jane Campion also rises to the challenge in &quot;The Water Diary&quot; in relation to Environmental Sustainability, showing the tough decisions that have to be made in a small outback community waiting desperately for the rains, building their hopes, fears, disappointments and indeed tears into a fantastical dream. Jan Kounen also finds a mythical aspect to the human condition in his Peruvian Amazon story (one of many similar stories showcased in Amnesty International&apos;s short documentary &apos;Poverty of Justice&apos; seen in accompaniment to the film) of the difficulties and dangers of mortality facing women giving birth in remote regions. The mix of documentary reconstruction and traditional storytelling through native song and dance in &quot;The Story of Panshin Beka&quot; is given additional force through some striking black-and-white cinematography.\n\nTipping the balance either one way or the other towards a higher average of good sections over bad is Abderrahmane Sissako&apos;s opening piece. Sissako&apos;s brilliance in the area of inventive politically-charged film-making is not in doubt after his last feature Bamako, and &quot;Tiya&apos;s Dream&quot; is beautifully filmed, showing the situation facing real people in African nations, but he makes his point rather too calculatedly and deliberately referential through a school lesson on... the 8 goals of the Millennium Development Goal. Borderline also is Gaspar Noé&apos;s &quot;SIDA&quot;, which at least has the benefit of the director&apos;s customary power and directness, relating of the case of a man dying from AIDS in his own words with only edgy, colour-saturated portraiture cinematography and a pounding heartbeat, and making it still rather intense.\n\nThose missing the mark completely for me are Mira Nair&apos;s segment &quot;How Can It Be?&quot; and Gus Van Sant&apos;s &quot;Mansion On The Hill&quot;, Nair taking on Gender Equality towards freedom of expression of a Muslim wanting a divorce from her husband to live with another man. Even if it means she may be making a wrong decision towards her blameless husband and son, she deserves the choice to make her own mistakes. Gus Van Sant, for his part, simply seems to have missed the brief entirely and just given the producers some left-over footage of teenage skateboarders for them to put TV advertisement boldface facts, figures and slogans on the Child Mortality.\n\nWim Wenders, unsurprisingly ends up being the most problematic, the director&apos;s film-making talent still obvious, but increasingly buried in heavy-handed messages. &quot;Person to Person&quot; is likewise admirable in its intent, but fails in its execution. He attempts to offer a corrective to the traditionally dry, preachy editorialising of news reports and documentaries on the subject of the Third World, by showing that direct action between the people in these countries can have an impact without the need for government intervention. It&apos;s a sharply filmed and edited piece and admirable also for its concision in explaining just how this can be achieved, but it doesn&apos;t manage to avoid sounding preachy and didactic itself.\n\nWhile there is certainly then some minor brilliance evident throughout individual segments of 8 and some strong points made on the grave consequences for the world should there be a failure to meet the Millennium Development Goals, the Wenders segment, ending as it does with footage of Bono chanting from the stage, does give the impression of the whole exercise being one of well-meaning good intentions, but one that by its very nature will inevitably end up preaching only to the converted who are willing to pay to go and see it, but which is no more likely to spur those with the power to effect change to honour those commitments they have made.",

But with the roundly-hated sequel in theaters I thought I&apos;d finally give the original a shot. And man, I realized I&apos;d missed out. Yes this movie is sometimes brooding and its aesthetics are superficially goth. Mostly, though, it&apos;s just an engaging action/revenge romp with lots of sly humor and a surprising amount of heart. The late Brandon Lee nails the lead role as Eric Da Raven; the supporting cast members (especially the always-excellent Ernie Hudson and Michael Wincott) are stellar; and the plot, effects, score and gory over-the-top action are unmistakably mid-90s in all the right ways.",

This one is all about Jesse Jane playing Heather who witnesses a murder which leads to a vicious crime lord. With two cops on her side, they work together as they try to investigate the whole scenario and conspiracy behind the killing.\n\nWith that in mind, you got an action flick blended with so much eroticism. Well, that&apos;s basically what you&apos;ve got there..\n\nNic Andrews is a type of director who wants to make porn movies close to mainstream stuff.. ..And this is his example.. Anyway, he did a good job. The DVD had a lot of good features on there which I can&apos;t mention. Anyway, if you ever see this movie.. Enjoy it, that&apos;s all I can say.

While young, she though she could do all she would, but reality is different, as she does nothing but giving cuisine lessons, learning French and taking care of her obsessive husband and her rebel sixteen-year-old daughter. But nobody knows that Ana has two lives: the boring real routine and another interesting one that only remains in her dreams. Unexpectedly, one day, she will be able to fulfill her dreams by traveling to Paris, where, who knows, dreams can become true. In fact it is just a romantic comedy but quite strange, as it mixes (clearly) reality and fiction, but it has no clear path, it goes from here to there but it is not able to explain everything correctly. While most of the film it is not clear, it is not boring and, despite being not good, it is more or less entertaining and keeps you on the screen without many yawns. Maybe the story is a little too unbelievable and it is impossible to take it seriously, but well, why not dream a little?",

      "reviewBody": "7.8 of 10. Not to be confused with the purely horrible Hybrid from 2007 or the at least enjoyable Super Hybrid of 2010, this is a quality film using reality-based horror built on sci-fi, war, and genetic experimentation.\n\nWhile the misinformed, weak science sci-fi films still fantasize and fill in gaps of traveling massive distances through variations on frozen sleep, this eliminates the distance problem completely by avoiding space travel to or from the planet. Instead, it takes advantage of well known, everyday scientific events, modern conflicts around Russia, secret government operations, and genetic experimentation to build a surprisingly plausible story with a smooth, though a little too obvious, setup for a sequel.\n\nGiven early reviews, the non-stereotypical look of the alien probably is a little too much for status quo critics to handle. It doesn&apos;t feel or look under-budgeted. The only thing hard science fiction fans can criticize involves telepathy and telekinesis. Such, however, is often the ouch with alien sci-fi - writers going complete fantasy on alien abilities.",

The characters are all representative of many generations. Nostalgia will get most of people. The actors are all great especially Michel Côté, Marc-André Grondin et Pierre-Luc Brilliant. Video and audio editing come from genius. The music is O_O (read the Trivia and you&apos;ll understand). I have nothing more to say than this movie will give you what you awaited for.

Penrith now has a new BMX track and from what I have read on the internet, Hickeys Lane BMX track is no longer in use.\n\nRegards,\n\nAshley Irons",

Hannelore Elsner did an amazing job! I only know her from German TV but her acting was convincing and never over the top. Well, the Alzheimer story is something we already know from Julie Christie&apos;s &quot;Away from her&quot;, which gave her an Oscar nod and Hannelore Elsner should at least win one of those German film prices. Juliane Koehler with a new hairdo wasn&apos;t bad either. We know her from excellent movies such as &quot;Aimee and Jaguar&quot;, &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot; or &quot;Downfall&quot;. This one is definitely not one of her best but her acting was still good and she is one of my favorite German actresses. I wish I could see her in more international productions in the future. On the whole a very good cast and a convincing film.",

Movie has a problem with very long shots and too trivial dialogs. Movie plot has been made in a completely tense rhythm but then we have slow pace dialog scenes where characters are telling YES or NO for several times. I am not sure if this is the nature of the language or local dialect in that particular part of Austria, but when reading the foreign subtitles that looks pretty dull. I might go and try to find some other films of the main lead cause I think he is pretty good. All in all, I would recommend this film.",

We&apos;re taken by the hand of this elderly celebrity in a world - and a town -that worships celebrity. The town also worships youth and box office grosses. For Whale, youth and box office grosses are way back in his distant pass. That&apos;s why, I imagine, the arrival of the gardener with Brendan Fraser&apos;s body, awakens in the old man some kind of spark. Their relationship is filled with a sort of emotional suspense that makes the entire movie, riveting. The story is told with a sort of personal melancholy that Bill Condon, the young writer/director, seems to understand fully. Compassion is in his eye and in his soul. The scene in which Ian McKellen remembers his swimming pool crowded with naked young men is one of the most beautifully reminders of how the aging heart remains alive within his memories. Very moving, very sad and very, very good.",

      "reviewBody": "I had the amazing opportunity to view this film at a university theatre at UC Berkeley where it had been subtitled by a student, which makes me wonder how accessible this film actually is, especially with a translation present. In any event, if you ever have the opportunity to see this masterpiece by the French situationists, you should definitely see it.\n\nThe story line is simple: a classic kung-fu movie has simply had the entire dialogue changed to represent the epic battle between the proletariats and the bureaucracy, with a martial arts school as the utopian commune.  That idea alone is comic genius, and as if the idea wasn&apos;t funny enough, the writing is hilarious.  For example, when a little girl runs away from her little boy friend, one of his friends comforts him and says something to the effect of, &quot;Please forgive her for being a Marxist, she just doesn&apos;t know better.&quot;\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it was definitely unique, but I also really think you would only enjoy it if you enjoy political satire and know a decent amount about different political viewpoints (and hopefully socialist history).  I know a fair amount about these things, and half the jokes were still lost on me.  In any event, this is an excellent intellectual comedy and I recommend it to anyone who might find it the least bit interesting.\n\nYes, dialectics can indeed break bricks!",

      "reviewBody": "After an explosion, private detective Maurice Pogue wakes up every morning with amnesia. The night before, he has always made sure to record on tape everything he would need to remember the next day, such as what is wrong with him and why. One very important detail: he must not tell anyone what is wrong with him, because he must testify in the case against Cornell, the bad guy responsible for the explosion, and without his testimony there is no case. Obviously, if he can&apos;t remember the explosion, he has no credibility as a witness.\n\nSarah Novak, who was supposedly killed in the explosion, comes to Pogue for help, saying she can&apos;t go to the police. She may be in the Witness Protection Program as fashion model Beth Holly. Or perhaps Beth is pretending to be Sarah.\n\nPogue and Sarah/Beth must search for a coin worth millions. One gag involves this coin being put into a parking meter.\n\nAnd Pogue is also the father of a baby. It would be a disaster if a baby was put in the care of someone in his situation.\n\nCornell would like Pogue to conveniently forget what he saw. Of course, he doesn&apos;t know that he has gotten his wish.\n\nRosenheim is the prosecutor in Cornell&apos;s case, but he is so dense that when given clues the blind street musician could see the significance of, he can&apos;t figure out what they mean. Dolby is Rosenheim&apos;s wheelchair-bound boss.\n\nSpeaking of the street musician, he is quite good. He plays the clarinet and people give him money. Next to him is an artist painting new versions of The Mona Lisa on the side of a building. I say &quot;versions&quot; because he is not good at accepting criticism.\n\nI liked a lot of the music in this movie. Some of it was traditional jazz, and the movie used various styles of music from old-style detective movies.\n\nThe concept of a private detective with amnesia was the funniest thing. Pogue had to be a detective every morning just to figure out who he was. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; in reverse.\n\nDana Carvey was okay as Pogue. He had several standout moments, such as the time Cornell came to his door just after Pogue reminded himself the landlord was demanding the rent or else! And there was the scene where, while watching an old detective movie (Bogart may have been in it, but I&apos;m not entirely sure), Pogue figured out how to solve his problem. And of course Dolby&apos;s birthday party at the movie&apos;s start.\n\nI thought Michael Gambon gave the best performance as the evil gangster Cornell. Not completely evil, but balanced and convincing.\n\nPogue&apos;s dog Baby (played by Barkley) added a lot, because he kept bumping into things because of his lack of depth perception. And of course the name means Pogue keeps searching for clues related to a baby.\n\nIt isn&apos;t great, but it is entertaining."

      "reviewBody": "For me, the soul of the novel The Magic Mountain is the clash of ideas expressed in the incessant arguments between Settembrini (the champion of the enlightenment values of humanism, democracy, science) and Naphta (representing a hyper-ascetic belief in religion, war, revolution, social upheaval and the clash of God and the devil). Later in the book, Peeperkorn introduces a third view of man centered on, daresay, pagan values (emotionalism, naturalism, non-idealism and anti-intellectualism). Perhaps unavoidably, and to its detriment, the movie gives short shrift to all of these large ideas, and most lamentably, fails to capture the ferocity of the battles between Settembrini and Naphta over the soul of Hans Castorp. This makes unintelligible the climactic confrontation between the two pedagogues in the snowy field.\n\nDismayingly, the Peeperkorn of Mann&apos;s novel is completely unrecognizable in the movie character. In the book, he is a larger-than-life charismatic figure who draws the other residents into his circle by the elemental force of his personality. In the movie, he is a sad and fearful old man, who feigns defiance of death in several over-wrought scenes not found in the book.\n\nThe movie also completely neglects important subordinate themes, such as the lure of Eastern passivity symbolized by Hans&apos; infatuation with Madam Chauchat and her &quot;Kirghiz&quot; (Asian) eyes and exemplified by the sense of timelessness he feels at the Berghof. (This is another topic on which Settembrini frequently lectures young Hans.)\n\nI enjoyed seeing the Berghof scenes brought to life, but, overall, I did not feel this was a successful film adaptation of Mann&apos;s book.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Breillat is back and, as she did with &quot;Romance&quot;, pushing the bounds of censorship in an intellectually challenging fashion. The story follows the sexual development of two sisters in their early teens. Their middle class family embody the usual social mores and protective attitudes. Moreover, the story makes us aware of the legal dilemma of under age sex, undertaken as a matter of conscious choice and with proper protection by the 15-year old (older) sister with a boyfriend only a few years her senior (ie the relationship would be legal in Netherlands but not in many countries, including France). These are two fairly &quot;normal&quot; sisters, although the younger one is excessively overweight and only fantasizes about getting a boyfriend. There is some possible interpretation that the 15-year old&apos;s psychological development would progress more soundly were she not (initially) fettered by taboos over her own virginity. In one scene, a TV in the background has a Breillat-type character being interviewed and giving her philosophy about the intrinsic nature of sex, how it is something common to us all and that can be understood by anyone, and that we are all alike inasmuch as no-one is perfect. The characters and scenes are painted brilliantly, the sibling rivalry coupled with intense sisterly bonding, the mother driving at night and, as many people will have, with a lack of sleep and so not as perfectly safely as normal. It is the realism and ordinariness of the situations that keep us on the edge of our seats. The dialogue has the realism that suggests youngsters may have suggested some of the lines, with their observations that have the power to startle us out of complacency. The use of actors so young in fairly explicit scenes will be a matter of great concern, but Breillat is serious about her work and convinces us that she is not pandering to sensationalism but raising valid questions about how we effectively handle the challenges presented by precocious adolescents. The film is more polished than Breillat&apos;s earlier work and has an unnerving denouement, well-delivered.",

      "reviewBody": "After twelve years, the neighbours of the Naderi family in Tehran write to Social Services to raise awareness and seek help with the family. The family is made up of an old man, his blind wife and his twin daughters, who he keeps locked in the house and has done for the twelve years of their lives. The parents claim they were only protecting their children but the papers tell stories of children chained up and kept like animals. The film crew watch on as the parents and children come to terms with this new, enforced freedom.\n\nWhenever director Samira Makhmalbaf heard about the story of the Naderi family she decided to make a film about it  two or three days later this film began, using film stock left over from her father&apos;s most recent film. Several weeks later the film was complete and the final product is a startingly assured product that is engaging, impressive and very balanced. I&apos;m not sure what specifically attracted Makhmalbaf to the story but she has managed to bring so much out of it that I imagine she saw a lot of themes worth exploring in the original article she read. The film follows the real people as they all try to come to terms with this new world  the blind wife who fears for her girls; the father who is only following teaching on raising girl and wants to protect them; and of course the girls who quickly go from barely being able to communicate to running and playing outside. On this very human level it is a compelling film that mixes documentary and drama to good effect and you easily care for the people.\n\nA scan of the plot may see your mind made up about the cruel Iranian father and the poor oppressed wife and girls, however to do this is a mistake because the film never does this, not once. The film looks at the people but it also looks at the view of society on women and the attitudes involved; it would be easy to just slate the religious, comparatively oppressive approach of such religious states but the film is too good for that. Instead it takes a balanced view that weighs up both views and doesn&apos;t judge anyone. By doing this the film is only stronger and more interesting because it comes over as a debate that engaged my brain in that aspect just as much as it engaged me with the people in the story.\n\nThe cast are almost all the real people &quot;playing&quot; their roles in front of the camera as they really happen; I&apos;m sure some of it were staged reconstructions but mostly it convinces as the real deal  happening as we watch. The father is compelling and the film&apos;s balance is evident in that it allows him to be confused and bewildered about the accusations against him. The wife is well presented as well  confounding those who will have tuned in to see a cruel man oppressing the women in his life. The twin girls are easy to like and they are the human aspect of the story come (literally) to life  their development is touching and engaging.\n\nOverall this is an excellent mix of documentary and drama that works on many levels. It is a human story that is touching but also works on other levels, being a thoughtful and balanced look at Iranian society, the restraints on people and on women generally. Without judging, it builds an interesting debate that produces a strong film that is well worth seeking out."

      "reviewBody": "Not the greatest movie of its kind, but far from the worst. Certain things are low points. Like continuity. Its so so. When a terrible storm hits the Argos you&apos;d expect the deck to pitch and not be stable. As the movie moves from one part of the story line to the next certain things seem to be left out. But for the most part these things are nonessential and their lack does not make the thing hard to follow, so the loss is minimal. But the upside ... The sets and costumes are well done. The movie, despite the lack of continuity in spots, flows well and is easy to follow. The dubbing, this flick being Italian, is OK. Dubbing, I think, can never be better than just OK. When a person speaks in one language and then the thing gets dubbed in another, well, the mouths and words are never going to match up all that well. But the folks who did the dubbed voices did their job very well. They carry the emotions that go with the plot and characters very well. In fact thats probably the best aspect, technically speaking, of the whole film. The choreography is pretty good. Fights actually look, more or less, like fights. The one eyed monster is campy style cool. The plot is fair for a movie about Jason and his friends. Its not hard to watch. If you like this genre I think you&apos;ll enjoy this movie.",

The premise is a good one, disembodied living head of centuries old warlock is dug up and exerts mind control over all, while looking for it&apos;s body. It has quite a nice, sudden ending that reminded me of Hitchcock (not in style, only in the fact that it ended rather unexpectedly - for an example, see Family Plot again) but with a neat anticlimax, one that predates the typical anticlimax of modern fright films. I won&apos;t spoil it by telling it, but if you can see this film and remember that it was made in 1958, then you&apos;ll enjoy it. If your idea of what&apos;s scary is Alien, or anything after that, then forget it, you&apos;ll probably be bored or laugh inappropriately. Not that Alien isn&apos;t scary, but that&apos;s a whole different generation of horror."

This German Count prefers elegant sports like fencing or drinking, more exciting if both are being played at the same time.\n\nStrange and modern times are these, even in Germany, when ordinary people don&apos;t appreciate the merits of their ancestors, forgetting and confusing titles of nobility as happens in this film in where a football player is considered a king! for the longhaired hordes what a disgrace are those the newest heroes?... it seems so because the film stars Herr Paul Richter, one-time Siegfried and now a footballer With the same running time as a football match, the film is as boring as that ordinary sport ; the story is full of clichés that mix sports and romance, depicting the story of Tull Harper, football player but also son of a leather manufacturer who is heading for bankruptcy in his business. This serious problem could be avoided with the help of Mabel Douglas ( Aud Egede Nissen ), a rich and Amerikan backer who doesn&apos;t really know if that nice boy loves her only for their millions ( football and millions??... what an incongruity ).\n\nOne of the scarce merits of this film is that is considered as one of the first &quot;football films&quot; in Deutschland, not a film genre in itself. It is an unimportant film that doesn&apos;t work as a football documentary ( the film includes only simple football shots ) and even less as a romance film with its static and foreseeable story full of the usual things( he loves me, she loves me not ), a tale that will end in a boring but supposedly interesting football match in where our modern hero, obviously, will win the match and the girl&apos;s love and fortune.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dribble one of his Teutonic heiresses.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "This powerful film follows the journey of three young aboriginal girls who are taken from their family and forced to assimilate into an empty culture by the white settlers of Australia. This is known as the &quot;STOLEN GENERATION&quot;, a dark period in Australian history which the current prime minister of Australia refuses to say sorry for the past atrocities. But this is not to say that this film preaches or manipulates emotions for political gain. No! It just tells the story with powerful images that allows the viewer to enter the torment of the stolen generation. Dialogue is minimal as our heroes are taken from their family and driven to the other side of Australia. But their will and instinct to be with their strong culture has the girls escape the camp prison and follow the rabbit-proof fence back home. The rabbit proof fence was built down the centre of Australia to contain the plague of rabbits from entering farm land. It was this white-man built fence that lead the girls back home.\n\nAs for all journeys, they are filled with internal conflict and confrontations with strangers. These confrontations with certain people show the diverse group of settlers in Australia. Not all were ignorant but most were repressed and abided to the harsh cultured laws. For instance, the girls arrive at a farmstead and are given clothing and food by a white woman. The motherly instinct of this woman understood that the girls had to be with their mothers. But at the same token the farm woman could not jeopardise her own family by looking after the girls or else it would have brought trouble. It was wonderful scenes like these that was played out visually without having to dumb it down with words. As human beings we understand these actions and need no explaining.\n\nThe most interesting relationship was the one between the aboriginal tracker in search of the girls. He could sense the persistence of these girls to get home by making it difficult for him to track them down. This he respected and slightly dropped his guard. Once again, a string of images tell of this distant relationship between tracker and girls.\n\nThe images also became so strong during the scene when the girls were taken from their mothers in a horrific manner. I doubt there will be a dry eye during that scene. This hooks you in as you then become the spirit of their journey back home.\n\nOnly by the performances of the girls do these scenes work because they are so natural and heartfelt. Children who overplay their role just become cute but those who underplay and rely on emotions of  the situation deliver a powerhouse performance that a trained actor may sometimes find difficult to achieve. At first the name of a high calibre actor - such as Kenneth Branagh - in an Australian film warns you where the limelight will shine. But Kenneth just took a step back and become another important confrontational figure in the journey.\n\nA bonus is the music  by Peter Gabriel. It is a mixture of his famous trademark of world music infused with that of the Aboriginal. It soars and plays with the emotions, maybe a little too much but when you are dealing with a thousand year old culture that has music as its central universe, then you may be able to understand that the overpowerful music is just an extension of that.\n\nCongratulations to all who were brave enough to bring a project of this strength to the screen. And for those who may wonder how I saw the film prior to its release, lets just say I was lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time. And No! I&apos;m not tied to the project in any way because I don&apos;t sell out that easily.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Violent Night (2022)&apos; is surprisingly earnest in its themes of Christmas magic and rekindling your Christmas spirit. What initially seems like a sardonic anti-Christmas movie soon reveals itself to be genuinely interested in spreading Yuletide cheer, although that&apos;s not to imply it doesn&apos;t also feature all the brutality, bad language and bodily fluids its concept promises. Merging &apos;Die Hard (1988)&apos;, &apos;Home Alone (1990&apos;, &apos;Bad Santa (2004)&apos; and &apos;John Wick (2014)&apos; (or, perhaps more accurately, some of its lesser imitators), the piece provides a stockingful of festive fun despite its undeniably derivative nature. David Harbour and John Leguizamo make up for the cast&apos;s general lack of charisma, as they&apos;re eminently watchable and sell even the silliest of dialogue. Though the piece is certainly self-aware, it&apos;s also really sincere and it establishes a strong sense of character for its central figure. In fact, Papa Noël actually has a relatively convincing character arc which prevents his inclusion from feeling as half-baked as it may initially seem. Although the flick sometimes comes closer to feeling like &apos;Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009)&apos; than &apos;Die Hard (1988)&apos; (particularly when it comes to most elements not directly associated with Santa), it features plenty of well-choreographed and exciting set-pieces that revel in all the gory mayhem you could want. The action never rises to the level of something like &apos;John Wick (2014)&apos;, but it&apos;s better than a lot of similar American stuff and it continues the welcome post-&apos;Wick&apos; trend of having clean camera work that favours wider compositions. The movie is really fun when it gets going. It has a few issues here and there, and it&apos;s arguably a little too sappy for its own good, but it&apos;s an entertaining actioner with a strong central performance and several accomplished set-pieces.",

This is compounded by the lack of an interesting an original script for grade A actor Sean Bean to work with. Brittany Murphy is also shortchanged by the script, and what at first appears to be a promising performance is not allowed to blossom.\n\nThis is symptomatic of the film as a whole - truly dramatic events are underplayed, and as a result the film feels like it has no climaxes.\n\n&quot;Don&apos;t Say A Word&quot; is a film with an interesting premise that has been produced as a run-of-the-mill thriller."

It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally stumbled upon Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, an abysmal jungle-based exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it.\n\nTawdry and unrelentingly dull, even by Franco&apos;s standards, this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level: the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough&apos;s Tarzan, albeit with a feminine twist; the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens, although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in Africa; and the death scenes are virtually bloodless (Franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter, but despite initial appearances, this isn&apos;t a cannibal movie and it isn&apos;t that gory).\n\nWhere the director does succeed, however, is in his casting of sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail-bait Diana. Running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loin-cloth, her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time, this nubile beauty makes quite an impression. Franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as treacherous traveller Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions), and Aline Mess as topless warrior woman Noba, thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 1/10 from me (although I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be receiving plenty more in the futureI have loads of his films yet to see).",

      "reviewBody": "As far as some action films go, &quot;Navy Seals&quot;, the 1990 film directed by Lewis Teague, doesn&apos;t deserve most of the criticism that some contributors to this forum have expressed. While it doesn&apos;t add anything to the genre, it is a movie targeted to a certain audience, who will no doubt react to it.\n\nOn the other hand, watching it on cable the other night, it proved to be the entertainment it&apos;s meant to be and nothing more. Let&apos;s hope the real Navy Seals will be more selective in picking someone that is as misguided and egocentric as Lt. Hawkins, who disobeys his orders and causes the death of a man that shouldn&apos;t have died.\n\nThis film appears to be a vehicle for Charlie Sheen who was at the height of his intense period. Michael Biehn plays the man in command, Lt. Curran with flair. Joanne Whalley is seen only briefly. The rest of the cast, notably, S. Ephata Merkerson and Dennis Haysbert contributed to make the film better than it is.\n\nAll in all, this is a film for action fans with not a lot of expectations.",

The result is The Tall Guy, probably the greatest comedy of 1989.\n\n I remember going to see it twice at the time and laughing all the way through it, amazed that British comedies could be this good.\n\nIt has a huge amount going for it with intelligence, cracking lines and some highly stylised photography by Adrian Biddle.\n\nCurtis&apos; semi-autobiographical script is based on his own days as a fall guy for Atkinson and the result is well worth a look."

      "reviewBody": "The concept of a downtrodden man getting his life back on track has been done many times before, but Ken Loach has managed to put a unique spin on it, as well as imbuing it with a lot of pathos.\n\nHaving Eric Cantona in a main role puts this film in a unique position, as there aren&apos;t many players like him who are so embedded into the psyche of a city. He in a way represents Manchester, which makes sense for Eric Bishop to visualise him specifically to help him out. Cantona&apos;s own story of struggle and then redemption makes him especially suited to helping out someone who is having a tough time in their life, which is why this story works so well.\n\nCantona himself has a decent screen presence, but Steve Evets puts in a powerhouse performance which really makes the film worth watching. He can really explode with fury, but his quieter scenes of disappointment, anguish and hope are also brilliant.\n\nLoach does well to manage the magical realism side of the story along with his usual kitchen-sink drama, and any conversation is exceptionally interesting because of that. Paul Laverty should also get a lot of credit for his screenwriting work here.\n\nThis is something I would definitely recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "The script for Double Team was originally called &quot;The Colony&quot; and by several accounts, it was actually quite good. Apparently, it went through many major alterations on its way to production until the final product bore little resemblance in tone and quality to the original script. Does this mean Double Team is a disaster? Not really, but its clear all the changes created some problems.\n\nOn the one hand, you have the participation of famed Hong Kong director Tsui Hark and world-class cinematographer Peter Pau. They manage to create some of the coolest, trippiest, most fantastical visuals this side of a MTV video and better still, do so without the excessively choppy editing that usually accompanies &quot;MTV-style&quot; films. You actually get to appreciate the luxuriously-shot images, though the film is by no means slow-paced. Better still, it&apos;s one of the few Van Damme movies that realizes the best Van Damme movies are the ones which absolutely never rely on Van Damme&apos;s acting (or anyone else&apos;s for that matter) to carry the film along. It&apos;s all action, goofily entertaining plot twists, and sweet visuals. As an action-packed, overblown, eye-candy fantasy, Double Team works very well.\n\nOn the other hand, it&apos;s painfully obvious that Double Team used to have a smarter script which called for a far more subtle and serious approach. Had these &quot;intelligent&quot; elements been completely erased or dumbed-down for the final product, this wouldn&apos;t have been a problem. However, it seems that some of the more subtle plot developments were left in and they do NOT mesh well with Tsui&apos;s and the rest of the final script&apos;s &quot;jackhammer&quot; approach to the story. For example, at one point a prescription label left on the wall is supposed to be noticed by Van Damme&apos;s character who then uses the name of the doctor on the label as a clue. However, unless you&apos;re paying very very close attention you&apos;d never know that. It&apos;s so small on screen, the label may as well have been blank. And the shot where the label is taken off the prescription bottle is far too quick and unclear. A single extra shot showing a closeup of the label would&apos;ve cleared things up immensely. But it never happens. The film contains several instances like this where a single clarifying shot or an extra line of explanatory dialogue would&apos;ve made things much clearer. The result is that what seem like glaring plot holes (even for this kind of movie) are in fact due to badly explained plot points. Such an obscure presentation might have worked on a quieter, more &quot;intelligent&quot; spy film where the audience knows they aren&apos;t going to be spoon-fed the plot. But after 40 minutes of terrible one-liners and ridiculous action, the last thing that should be required of Double Team&apos;s audience is to suddenly pay close attention to what&apos;s happening.\n\n I don&apos;t know whether Tsui Hark was trying to keep in some subtle elements while reconciling it with the rapid-fire approach, or whether he just didn&apos;t care about such details and wanted to keep things moving (Probably the latter, as his subsequent movie, Knock Off, experimented with this abstract, to-hell-with-storytelling visual approach to the nth degree). Whatever the case, the result is a pretty wild but somewhat confusing action movie that could&apos;ve been much better with minor changes."

      "reviewBody": "There is a mysterious gloved and masked killer stalking and murdering beautiful young Italian women. Sound familiar? But of course, this is a Giallo from the early 70&apos;s! \n\nThe Case of the Bloody Iris is part of Anchor Bay&apos;s four dvd set The Giallo Collection. Three of the movies can be purchased separately, but The Case of the Bloody Iris can only be purchased as part of the set.\n\n The Case of the Bloody Iris starts out with a pretty young blonde woman being murdered in an elevator in an urban apartment building . The killer is wearing rubber gloves and stabs her with a knife that looks like a scalpel. A day later in the same apartment building, another woman is drowned in her bathtub by a killer wearing the same rubber gloves. This murder is pretty brutal to watch as far as movie murders go. \n\nThere is an architect by the name of Andrea (George Hilton), who dated the second murdered woman and starts seeing another woman, Jennifer (ably portrayed by the beautiful Edwige Fenech) who recently left a small religious group lead by a crazed guy who keeps harassing her and trying to get her back to the group. Through a flashback scene we discover that they were into group sex and and he seems to be, and is, seriously deranged. There is also a woman living with her father in an apartment in the building and she hits on every woman she encounters, which in this film are beautiful models and dancers. \n\nA couple more murders into the film and Andrea is suspected by the police of performing the murders, especially after a woman is murdered on the street and witnesses see only him covered in blood and running away from the scene. The police have been following him using a detective who serves as a minor bit of comic relief (fortunately he doesn&apos;t try to be too funny). Jennifer also starts suspecting Andrea of committing the murders and after they arrange a secret meeting trying to elude the police, he seems more guilty then ever.\n\nThis is a well made movie with a decent script and is well acted by the entire cast. I recommend it for anyone who like a well made Giallo and also as a decent who dunnit. \n\nThis movie is released in a beautiful 2.35:1 widescreen display. The sound quality, while dated, sounded great out of my speakers. Extra features on the disk include an alternate stabbing scene and theatrical trailer. The alternate stabbing scene is just an abbreviated version of one of the stabbings late in the movie. Personally I liked the longer version in the film better. The Giallo Collection goes for around $40-50 which means each movie is around $10-13 each. This is a great price for movies that may have never seen the light of day in U.S. except for the Anchor Bay&apos;s decision to bring well made Italian Giallo&apos;s to the American market."

      "reviewBody": "After watching this film for the second time I realized just how important the affection that occurs between Hoke and Daisy really is.  What grows between these two is something most people only wish to have in their lives. What is so special about it, though?\n\nFrom the beginning of their relationship, the two are forced to be together. Daisy is forced to have a driver and Hoke is hired on for that position. For both, the relationship is one out of need.  Hoke needs a paying job and Daisy needs a driver in her old age (although, she would never admit it to anyone especially herself).\n\nAs time goes by, though, Daisy&apos;s need of Hoke becomes clearer to herself. She begins to depend on him.  This is definitely made clear at the end when Hoke is feeding Daisy her pumpkin pie, and she enjoys each bite fully.\n\nAnother aspect of the movie which got to me was the great array of choices the director made with the filming.  Hoke is a character of very few words but teaches Daisy so much.  Morgan Freeman&apos;s acting in this character is amazing.  The knowledge he shows within his eyes is one reason I almost felt closer to him than Daisy did throughout the first half of the movie.  In a way, he teaches her a new way of life.  He does so by showing himself truly and honestly.\n\nAnother choice the director made was in the symbolic way the film was made. The beauty of the many seasons is shown through the changes of the landscape.  The trees transform from winter to spring and the streets go from sheets of ice to warm asphalt.  And the cars get larger and more high tech.  Time is so important in Daisy&apos;s and Hoke&apos;s affection/friendship that this is a great way to show that.\n\nThere are so many aspects of this film which I could go on and on about. It is a wonderful film of which any person can get a fulfilling movie watching experience out of.  They can also learn a lot from it, too!  Watch it."

      "reviewBody": "Even though I was planning to watch something else that Saturday night, I came across BBC2 where &quot;The Night Porter&quot; was on and saw it once again. The first time I saw the movie I was a bit disappointed. I had heard so much about this movie that the film couldn&apos;t live up to my high expectations. But some scenes found a place in the back of my mind and stayed there. The second time I saw it I was intrigued more and more and ever since I see it as the classic it should be.\n\nIf ever there was a difficult movie, it was &quot;The Night Porter&quot;. The pace is slow and the characters are all weird. There aren&apos;t many movies where you get a homosexual Nazi wanting to be a ballet dancer and a sadistic Nazi still in love with love with a masochistic girl from the camps. (There&apos;s more, but I don&apos;t want to spoil the plot.) Only a spark of the plot could have been the subject for lots of raunchy exploitation movies, but &quot;The Night Porter&quot; manages to keep its class. The movies is set years after the war. Some Nazis were fortunate enough not to be caught and got on with their lives. Unfortunately one person has survived the camps as well. She immediately recognizes Max (Dirk Bogarde), her cruel S&amp;M-master, and he (now a night porter in a hotel) recognizes her (Charlotte Rampling) as well. The only problem is that the other living Nazis cannot know she&apos;s still alive, or they would assassinate her. The passion between Max and his former slave returns and the Nazis find out about their relationship. Max tries to keep her out of their hands, so madly in love that he wants to die for her. (Again, more information would spoil the movie.)\n\n&quot;The Night Porter&quot; is one of the few movies where S&amp;M-relationships aren&apos;t immediately reduced to a bunch of idiots and losers playing around with whips and leather masks. It also dares to show you other Nazis than the Pavlovian dogs you normally get to see. And above all it stars Charlotte Rampling as Lucia. Watch her as she performs the dance of Salomé and gets a present from Max (know your Bible and have an idea of what&apos;s to come). Watch her face and her near-skeletonlike body very closefully: that is how you should act disgust. Watch her as she locks herself in the bathroom and tries to hurt Max&apos;s foot with some glass. Listen to the music, the perfect addition to this murky movie.\n\nDue to the difficulty of the movie it&apos;ll never raise above its status as cult classic and actually that&apos;s a shame. Be brave and try it.",

      "name": "And the award for silliest/most awkwardly written thriller of the year goes to--",
      "reviewBody": "This one might be too high concept for its own good. It&apos;s part high-tech heist film--or to make that appropriately lighter, the end of Office Space (1999), part adulterous thriller, part slasher/stalker, and part Duel (1971), Christine (1983), Maximum Overdrive (1986)/Trucks (1997), Joy Ride (2001) and Black Cadillac (2003), almost all set in a parking garage to save money.\n\nAs inherently silly as that mixture might be, it could work if written, directed and acted carefully enough. With the exception of Dan Mundell as Eddie, who is delightfully campy and over the top--he almost reminded me of Don Knotts as a bizarre Barney Fife, the performances in Throttle are nothing to write home about, but they&apos;re good enough. And director James Seale has the mechanics of basic thriller and slasher/stalker scenes down pat. Those two facets make this film almost work. Almost.\n\nWhat kills it is the script. Unfortunately, Seale was also one of the writers, along with Neil Elman, but the principal cast is also partly to blame, because they should have caught the problems with the script at various stages of making the film. For example, we&apos;re shown that the lead character, Tom Weaver (Grayson McCouch) is trapped in an office building&apos;s parking garage. His car has been disabled. But this is a parking garage that people are still using, meaning that they&apos;re driving their cars out of it--we see people leaving their offices and getting in their cars to go home, and there are one or two security guards on duty. For most of the film, you keep asking yourself, &quot;Okay, why doesn&apos;t he just walk down the ramps and out of the garage? How stupid is this guy?&quot; He actually begs people to give him a ride out of the garage, but it never hits him to just simply walk the path that cars would take.\n\nWell, it turns out that there&apos;s not only a security &quot;turnpike&quot; bar in the garage, but also a gate that can be closed and not driven through. Also, there&apos;s a reason that the security guards might not open or be able to open the gate. But we&apos;re not shown either of these facts until almost the end of film--and they wouldn&apos;t make much sense until then. But that&apos;s bad writing, because we need a reason that Tom can&apos;t or wouldn&apos;t try to just walk out of the garage right away, near the beginning of the film . . . at least if we&apos;re not to conclude that he must have been lobotomized. Additionally, there&apos;s a red herring character that got into the garage somehow, so that somewhat negates the reasons that Tom couldn&apos;t have just walked out.\n\nThis kind of writing plagues the whole film. Another example--a truck is chasing Tom through the garage, trying to run him over, and he frequently just stands in the way, even though the garage is filled with obstacles that a vehicle couldn&apos;t easily go around (or through), like other cars and concrete pillars. Tom keeps making inane decisions like that, even at the very end of the film, but I don&apos;t want to detail them all. Besides I don&apos;t have room. Detailing them all would take many thousands of words. Suffice it to say that Seale and Elman have given us maybe the dumbest protagonist ever.\n\nSo aside from enjoying scenes where Seale gets his directorial mechanics right--things work often enough on the &quot;trees&quot; level despite the protagonist&apos;s inanity (and heck, some people just are stupid and why can&apos;t we show them in films?), and aside from enjoying a creative way to keep the budget way down--at least this isn&apos;t another &quot;people running through the woods&quot; film, any enjoyment you get out of Throttle is likely to see just how stupid and ridiculous it can get, and it does tend to keep topping itself in that department. Because of this, it may be worth seeing for fans of &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; films, but everyone else should avoid it.",

There&apos;s a certain degree of simplicity in this movie that makes watching it a memorable experience. Performance wise it is Sanjeev Kumar -- in an interesting comic role -- and Meenakshi Seshadri -- her innocent face and somewhat gullible, somewhat strong character remains in the mind long after the movies is over -- who deserve all the praise. Jackie Shroff, in the title role is good but watching the movie one cannot help but think that Mr Ghai should have stuck to his first choice for the lead -- Sanjay Dutt. Sanju was the best man for this role and, moreover, after all these years he still is a successful &quot;HERO&quot; unlike Jackie. All in all a simple, sweet musical love story and one of Subhash Ghai&apos;s best works.",

Most &quot;family&quot; movies promise to be fun for the whole family but this is one of the few that is able to keep this promise. Sune&apos;s family (made famous in the books by Anders Jacobsson &amp; Sören Olsson) plan to go to Greece on their holiday but after a minor mishap at the travel agency, Rudolf (the dad, played by Peter Haber) decides that it&apos;s too expensive, so they have a caravanning holiday instead.\n\nIt&apos;s full of funny moments throughout. Many of those are thanks to Peter Haber who has rightfully received some praise for playing the role of the dad, but all the actors are doing a great job. Gabriel Odenhammar, playing the role of the younger brother Håkan, can also be seen in the popular sitcom &quot;Svensson Svensson&quot;. Andreas Hoffer who plays the leading role Sune, hasn&apos;t done anything notable after this that I&apos;m aware of, but he suits the role perfectly nonetheless. The famous comedian Robert Gustafsson (&quot;the funniest man in Sweden&quot; according to many) also has a small role.\n\nBesides the funny parts the movie also has a sweet love story. Although there are lots of convenient (plot wise) coincidences the story feels more real than most American romantic comedies. It&apos;s really easy to relate to all of the characters which make the story feel more real and the funny parts even funnier.\n\nI recommend this to everybody!",

      "reviewBody": "Sorority Girls And The Creature From Hell is an awesomely BAD movie.It&apos;s something I&apos;d never, ever watch again, buy on VHS, DVD or whatever but it is entertaining &amp; worth watching at least once.It was made in 1990 but feels like it was made in the 80&apos;s.This is the type of movie you&apos;d want to have some friends over, sit back, relax, have a few, smoke something &amp; laugh .......Now only if I was a drinker &amp; had some friends.Other than the girl at the beginning of the movie who took 10 minutes to dry herself off &amp; the bad acting (Of course) the only thing that stuck out for me about this movie was the *creature* It looked like they bought an extremely cheap Halloween mask, struck some random guy in it &amp;......Voila!!! We have *The Creature* I don&apos;t know what I was expecting but I was expecting something that looked better.Maybe even scary looking but it was more funny looking than anything.If you&apos;re not into BAD movies, you won&apos;t like this movie but if you are then I&apos;d suggest, at least giving Sorority Girls And The Creature From Hell a shot.With a movie title like that, how could you not?",

The only sad thing about the movie is that a lot of the brilliant jokes and highlights are seen in the preview trailer. As this was a debut for a feature movie from the director i am looking forward seeing more from him. Two of the three main actors performed for the first time but did their job really good. I don&apos;t know if somebody from out of Bavarian gets all the jokes but if you want to get the idea about the &quot;real life&quot; in the Bavarian forest you really shouldn&apos;t miss this one. Gets 8 out of 10 which is really really good (i never give 10).\n\nEnjoy it!",

The production is pretty decent, as is the cast, but the film is so woefully over-the-top that you just want to slap director Michael Winner sometimes. What could have been. And that nudity thrown in for no apparent reason is absurd. The scene where Faye whips the clothes off the wife of her lover at his funeral is classic camp, however. Best performance is given by Denholm Elliott, who plays Faye&apos;s put-upon husband. This is in the same league as the even more preposterous Mata-Hari...which even shares co-star Oliver Tobias! This one is good for a few laughs.",

Upon George&apos;s return, he meets up with his old friend David Filby and catches him up on what his activities are in the future.  As the meeting is taking place you can see the sadness as George must hold back what he knows about the fate of his old friend.  This adds something to the film and also puts a bit of closure on the story.  This is a fantastic epilogue to a great film."

Killing is allowed to violent individuals in a game called Big Hunt where the participants are alternatively Hunter or Victim. The winner of each round is awarded with a prize and the survivor after ten rounds, wins one million dollar award (in 1965).\n\nWhen the American huntress Caroline Meredith (Ursula Andress) completes her ninth round, she comes to Rome to kill her tenth victim. She negotiates with the sponsor Ming Tea Company to kill his victim in front of the cameras. The cynical Marcello Poletti (Marcello Mastroianni) is her target and has just succeeded in his marriage annulment with Lidia (Luce Bonifassy) but has not disclosed to his lover Olga (Elsa Martinelli). Marcello suspects that Caroline is his hunter, but is not sure; further he falls in love with her and he is reluctant to kill her.\n\n&quot;La decima vittima&quot; is a funny and entertaining comedy with a silly but cult story. The sexy Ursula Andress is in the top of her beauty and shows a perfect chemistry with Marcello Mastroianni. In the end, the viewer has 92 minutes of fun. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Décima Vítima&quot; (The Tenth Victim&quot;)\n\nNote: On 31 January 2023, I saw this film again.",

AndressÂ’ final victim is the cool, sun-loving Italian Marcello (Mastroianni) who also needs to notch up another kill!\r\n\r\nOscarÂ® Winning director Elio PetriÂ’s groundbreaking film heralded generations of films, like Â“RollerballÂ” or SchwarzeneggerÂ’s Â“Running ManÂ”, about gladiatorial-death shows and announced our age of increasingly outrageous reality-TV and the latest fascination with Â“Hunger GamesÂ” dystopia.\r\n\r\nIts exquisite Pop-Art visuals, and humorous visual observations have influenced countless films, none more than the Austin Powers sets and costumes. Sourced from HD master restored in the original widescreen film format. This truly seminal cult film is released for the 1st time in UK in this definite Numbered CollectorÂ’s Lenticular Edition.",

      "reviewBody": "In a film seemingly not supervised by a director, two California college roommates, Chuck (Tate Donovan) and Wally (Grant Heslov) take part in a vapid adventure obviously targeted at a barely pubescent audience.  Chuck has an opportunity of which he has dreamed, to work for a large corporation where he will begin at $60000 per year, if he will complete a pre-employment assignment for the CEO (Robert Stack), a friend of Chuck&apos;s father.  His duty is to deliver an expensive new Porsche, a birthday gift to the CEO&apos;s daughter in Lake Tahoe, but naturally complications occur due to Wally, the irresponsible friend of Chuck.  Wally convinces Chuck to first utilize the Porsche as &quot;bikini bait&quot; in San Diego, where there is coincidentally a scheduled beauty pageant, and where the car is stolen.  The manipulation of Chuck by Wally makes little sense throughout this affair, but sensible behaviour is not readily found within the script, as it would only interfere with pratfalls and bathing suit competitions.  It is enough to mention, as ever with this type of film, a providential solution is found for personal relationship problems and that no one seems to mind if logic vanishes along the way.  A payday is given to veterans Stack, Leslie Nielsen and Elizabeth Ashley, all of whom essentially create their roles, and a bright spot is a performance by funnyman Robert Klein, with his usual off-kilter derelict, in this instance an aging surfer.  Poorly written and edited, this picture can yet claim freedom from any mean-spirited component, its most offensive facet being that the viewing of it is fundamentally a waste of time.",

The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now.",

      "reviewBody": "The French movie Conte de printemps (1990) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title, A Tale of Springtime. It was written and directed by Éric Rohmer. (It was the first of Rohmer&apos;s Tales of Four Seasons. Appropriately, the movie bursts with color--grass, flowers, trees.)\n\nAnne Teyssèdre portrays Jeanne, who teaches philosophy at a lycée in Paris. (I learned that philosophy is a required course in the senior year in a lycée.) Florence Darel plays Natacha, an 18-year-old student of piano at the conservatory.\n\nFor complicated reasons, Jeanne can&apos;t stay in her own apartment or in her boyfriend&apos;s apartment. That means she stays with Natacha, and then visits Natacha&apos;s vacation estate. Natacha tries to make her father and Anne lovers, and that&apos;s the basic plot of the film.\n\nOne of my cinema buff friends pointed out to me that John Sayles never makes the same movie twice. I have to agree--I just reviewed Matewan and The Secret of Roan Inish. Worlds apart--literally and figuratively.\n\nNot so with Rohmer. He has a style, and he sticks to it. His characters don&apos;t take dramatic action. In fact, the most active thing they do is to open a book and settle down to read it. What Rohmer&apos;s characters do is talk. When they&apos;re done talking, they talk some more. It&apos;s not gossip. In one long scene there&apos;s a discussion about the finer points of Existentialism. The reason I respect Rohmer as a director is that when his characters talk, it&apos;s interesting to hear what they have to say.\n\nAnne Teyssèdre and Florence Darel are both well known actors in France, but neither made the decision to work outside France. (However, Florence Darel got close enough to Hollywood to be propositioned by Harvey Weinstein.) Both women are fine actors.\n\nIt&apos;s a pleasure to see a film with women in both lead roles. (Not common in 1990, and still not common 30 years later.)\n\nI enjoyed this movie and recommend it. It has a strong IMDb rating of 7.3. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary will be an eye-opener for many Americans. It tells the story of an on-going non-violent protest movement on the West Bank of the Palestinian Territories. The movement has been created and led by Palestinians--a people often portrayed as terrorists or fanatics by the Western media. Some intrepid international activists as well as some Israelis have joined the movement, but the focus of this film is on the Palestinians.\n\nThe film portrays the actual protests and the response by the Israeli military. Just as interesting are numerous brief interviews with many people including the leaders of the protests, an Israeli activist and an Israeli military leader on the ground (who I began to suspect was probably later fired, as his comments were damning as well as humorous). Many people might be shocked to see a Hamas member talk about the value of non-violent protest and how he has met progressive Jews whom he now views as comrades. Not a bearded mullah, he is a math teacher.\n\nThe protests I believe were filmed in 2003, but this movement against the Israeli theft of Palestinian land continues on the West Bank. Since it is rarely covered by the Western media, this film may be your only chance to get a good look at it.",

      "description": "When the residents of Budrus learn that the Israeli army plans to build the Separation Barrier through their town, cutting them off from neighboring Palestinian villages and uprooting their precious olive groves, they decide to organize. Under the leadership of Ayed Morrar, Palestinian men of all political factions come together to wage an unarmed struggle to preserve their lands. Victory seems unlikely until AyedÂ’s 15-year-old daughter steps in to organize a female contingent that brings the women of Budrus to the front lines in a tense stand-off with the military.\r\n\r\nAs word of the nonviolent protest spreads, Israeli citizens, international activists and Palestinians from other villages join the people of Budrus to demand that the Barrier be moved. Struggling side by side, father and daughter unleash an inspiring, yet little-known movement that is still gaining ground today. Featuring interviews with unarmed demonstrators, Israeli soldiers and the citizens of Budrus, this harrowing, action-filled, and ultimately inspiring documentary has given hope to audiences around the world with its story of the ground-breaking nonviolent movement spreading across the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",

The film is passable, and even enjoyable at times, with a good message and a meaningful story about fathers and sons at its core.\n\nHartnett, like the rest of the cast, do a serviceable job and the acting is pretty good throughout the film, though people thinking Jackson will win or even be nominated for a flick like this need to put down the Kool Aid. It&apos;s a nice little film, a modest surprise even, but hardly anything award worthy.\n\nYou can read my full review online at RazorFine Review.",

This is one of it.\n\nFor almost no reason at all (At least it&apos;s not explained in the movie), a guy comes into a cave looking for a hidden sword. He finds it, and the sword transforms him into a super ninja. He then goes out to a golf course, and kills a couple (Again it&apos;s not explained who they were) and gets chased by the cops. Cops shoots him with guns and shot guns, but the ninja guy doesn&apos;t die (Again no reason). Then he escapes, and meets a girl (Lucinda Dicky). Then a strange thing happens: The spirit of the sword transfers to the girl, and now the girl becomes the super ninja. Then the possessed girl goes out on the revenge on people that shot the first ninja guy. Now enter Sho Kosugi. He&apos;s a ninja too, and seems to know all about what&apos;s going on, and shows up at key locations (Again for no reason explained). How would they save the girl from the ninja possession ?\n\nThis is movie that&apos;s purely made for entertainment. As you can see, the premise of the story suddenly happens, and then just keeps going without any explanation, but you don&apos;t care because of Lucinda&apos;s physical charm. She&apos;s the most beef cake actress I&apos;ve ever seen. Other supporting actors are pretty good. Whatever the reason, the producers knew what they were doing, because this is an entertaining movie.\n\nIt&apos;s a good movie, and is recommended for viewing."

      "reviewBody": "Nostalgic for me in many ways. I managed to sneak into the theater in my home-town in &apos;58 (it was an &quot;X&quot; certificate then) to watch it. Karloff was an old &quot;relic&quot; even then!!!  I remember thinking just how futuristic 1970 seemed. Believe it or not, people were talking planetary COLONISATION by the 70&apos;s, back in those days. (Actually, what the hell HAS happened the last three decades?)\n\nAnyway back to the plot - there ISN&apos;T one! Karloff shambles around his old shadowy and fog-machine driven castle occasionally doing the Dr Phibes bit on his organ. The monster is a cack-fest and everyone should be having a good time.\n\nOk Ok, sad in a way to see Karloff basically sending up his own classic role, but hey its STILL Boris Karloff! \n\nIn MY mind though, I still see a 13 year old boy staring up in wonder at a big screen with an evil monster on the loose. It was fun, it was THEN......best tribute you can pay it now is to just enjoy it for what it is/was."

So naturally I wanted to see Jerry succeed ( as well as Dean of course ) in his now solo career. To my Mother&apos;s shock and amazement I hung an 8 1/2 by 10 inch photo of Liliane Montevecchi ( wearing that black sexy outfit from the movie ) on my bedroom wall. Raging hormones at age 10 ??? Maybe LOL\n\nBut seriously I thought the movie was a riot. David Wayne and Joe Montell cracked me up as did Peter Lorre. Never stopped laughing. Funny thing though; I&apos;ve never seen this movie repeated on TV. This is disappointing. That photo of Liliane stayed on my wall until it darn near wore out. Jerry&apos;s first movie after the split up was Delecate Delinquint which starred Darren McGavin.\n\nThe type of humor is probably dated by today&apos;s ( yuk ) standards but I can tell you for a fact that the entire theater audience laughed as hard and as long as I did.\n\nSo, if you get a chance to see this movie, I recommend it. It is in black and white but that&apos;s OK.",

      "reviewBody": "Tahmoh Penikett, directed to play the part of a wizard trapped in another world, leans heavily into that flavor. He gives Alar an extravagance and charm that is little bit too much, even in just these 11 short minutes, but he&apos;s clearly having a great time in his role. Erin Karpluk has a more clear-cut role as Kim, a cynical travel agent who happens to catch Alar&apos;s attention. Playing the &quot;straight man&quot; to Penikett&apos;s more boisterous show, Karpluk capably demonstrates Kim&apos;s put-upon &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; attitude in reaction to the fancy stranger&apos;s seeming eccentricity.\n\nThe computer-generated effects and visuals are fine, certainly sufficient for a production of this nature. Wing Lee&apos;s costume design is more notably eye-catching; as simple as the wardobe is here, it effectively adds to the credibility of the story, and looks good. I&apos;m also amused by the suggestion of how the magic of another world becomes inhibited in ours.\n\nAbove all, though, I just like the small narrative Jonathan Williams concocted. The air Alar puts on is immediately a little overbearing, but that feeling is lessened after the first couple minutes, when the camera no longer focuses solely on Penikett. And while this tiny tale isn&apos;t especially fancy, it&apos;s entertaining, and I quite enjoy the ending that in its own way gives a marginally new perspective to the preceding 10 minutes as Karpluk is allowed to stand a little taller.\n\nWorth watching? If you like silly fantasy stories, then I&apos;d say so.",

Overall Piper Perabo is a much better actress and doesn&apos;t need to do made for TV movie but if it&apos;s one of those days when u don&apos;t feel like getting out of your pajamas this movie is for u.",

At first, I thought this was going to be a nice little family film that might even be enjoyable to watch. However, whatever message there is in this movie is lost by all the stupidity going on.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was the parents have grown apart because the husband doesn&apos;t laugh at her anymore? How about the fact that they hardly even speak and don&apos;t show any affection towards each other. Another thing is that African sounding girl the kids hang out with. How does she get the document approved and how is she conveniently at their house whenever they come home, does she hide in the bushes? Also, the youngest daughter could use some speech therapy classes and the son is pretty annoying as well. George Takei is a very strange choice for their family friend. He comes across as more of a slave than their friend. Wasn&apos;t he remodeling their whole house? In conclusion, this movie is drastically stupid. I know its basically a kids movie but its pretty sub-par even for oblivious children. Now, a movie like Home Alone is a family film but it actually has some substance. I would avoid this movie if your looking for entertainment, but you could rent it if you want to see how bad it is. My class and I had many a good laugh while watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ten&quot; really impressed me for many reasons. The first one is the interpretation of the non-professional actresses and the boy Amin Maher. It is simply amazing the first sequence (number 10) with fifteen minutes of dialogs between the lead character and her son without any cut. The second reason is the intense and impressive insight in the repressed women&apos;s world in Iran. I believe that most of the Westerns have no idea about the feelings and the culture of Iranian women, and Abbas Kiarostami shows very real dialogs picturing the lifestyle of a middle class woman and some samples in other women of different classes (the prostitute, the religious woman etc.). The third reason was the simplicity and the originality of the location: inside a car, with a divorced woman transporting her resented son; her sister; a prostitute; an old lady; and a romantic young woman, along different days. I would never imagine such a splendid scenario for a movie with such a theme. Last but not the least, the remarkable beauty of the face of the driver (Mania Akbari) is awesome: she is exotic for Brazilian standards, but really a very beautiful woman. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;10 Dez&quot; (&quot;10 Ten&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The harmless school teacher Robinson (Bentley) seeks revenge on a cold and greedy crook (Slater) who had his wife killed. The plot is familiar, the details of the revenge rather ingenious.\n\nThis is actually a rather solid and effective chiller, based on Stephen King&apos;s memorable short story. Instead of adding countless new themes in an effort to show the audience that they are not &quot;merely&quot; making a horror flick, the filmmakers have added scenes that actually foreshadow and strengthen the ending.\n\nThis hardly classifies it as a classic, but I found surprisingly little to gripe about and actually one or two additions that I found impressive. Christian Slater seems to be enjoying his part without turning it into camp and Besley manages to convey some real human emotions without seeming to reach for the Oscars. In this sort of (short) movie, restraint is just as important as ideas, seeing as how countless thrillers just go overboard on a desperate quest for &quot;impact&quot;. \n\nThe cinematography and sound engineering stand up to scrutiny and the minor parts are well executed. In short, this one works.",

      "reviewBody": "Gone is director Eli Roth, the desolate European location and a major theatrical release, but that didn&apos;t stop Sony Pictures from developing a third entry in the semi-successful but uber-popular Hostel series.\n\nIngeniously titled Hostel Part III, the terror comes to America with a setting in none other than Sin City itself – Las Vegas, where a group of guys get together for a bachelor party only to have their week-end fun interrupted by events of torture and extreme misfortune at the hands of the Elite Hunting Club.\n\nThe &apos;fun&apos; begins when one of the four bachelor party friends is abducted from an out-of-control party. He is taken to some remote yet high class facility that has state-of-the-art torture rooms equipped with classy looking tables and display walls filled with random torturing tools. Outside the room watching behind a large glass pane are a group of high class business men and women who use hi-tech betting equipment to play &apos;Wheel of Misfortune&apos; – a gambling game where they can bet on everything such as what a tortured individual might yell out when at the height of their pain.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining friends begin a desperate search to find their missing companion. A search that will land them in the same torture room subjected to the gruesome effects of the sadistic game.\n\nDirected by Scott Spiegel, Hostel III has no resemblance to the previous Eli Roth creations. The new setting might bring the series into a more modern world, but it was the dark, dungy backdrop of Slovakia that made Hostel that much more frighteningly believable.\n\nScreenwriters attempted to fill Hostel III with rudimentary twists in an attempt to try and out-smart their audience, but they were generally unnecessary and hardly OMG material. Couple that with some extremely unfunny lines (&quot;Is this a joke?&quot; one about to be tortured man screams answered by &quot;Oh yea, and the punchline is a killer&quot;) and characters that as wooden as an Ikea bedroom furniture set and you get the gist of this unworthy third entry.\n\nOf course, billed as a horror film, it is the torture (or torture porn) and bloodletting that will make or break the film with franchise fans and Hostel III can&apos;t hold a candle to the two Roth installments. Even with a state-of-the-art torture facility, the kills are truly uninspired and lacking in any true &apos;I can&apos;t watch&apos; scenes of extremedom (I just made that word up). And nudity? Well, let&apos;s just say that Hostel III can border on the PG-13 edge of nudism.\n\nWith an opening scene that did nothing more than offer a chuckle to an ending that was just plain stupid, Hostel III proves that the franchise is now dead and those that have been tortured the most are us saps that paid money to soothe our curiosity with Part III.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

      "reviewBody": "I remember seeing this 20 yrs ago and having a very favorable impression, but the recent copy I bought and viewed this week showed both better and worse aspects, different from what I recalled. Anyway, the story is quite catching and most of the acting is above average, thanks to a good ensemble cast of quality folks. Very well done art/set design makes up for rather standard plot direction, with some nicely eerie moments. There&apos;s well written, believable dialog interspersed with silly, and well developed characters interspersed with stereotypes. So it&apos;s a mishmash but a good one. Would have been nice to see a more believable military response to the viral outbreak, but the budget must have only been enough for a small crew of national guard type soldiers rather than a more believable crack platoon outfit that would have been all over the locals, and sent them packing. Definitely a good half of a double feature with Endangered Species, or Andromeda Strain."

      "reviewBody": "Released before the Hollywood Code began being reinforced, Murders in the Zoo is primarily interesting for how graphic a couple of the murders are and for the presence of Charlie Ruggles and Lionel Atwell.\n\nRuggles provides the same kind of comic relief he would provide five years later in Bringing up Baby, coincidentally interacting comically with big cats in both films.\n\nObjectively, Murders in the Zoo is fairly slow going, and even the presence of Atwell in a typically villainous role can&apos;t make it as entertaining as it ought to be. The pacing is slow, and the script doesn&apos;t provide enough suspense and action as, for instance, Mystery of the Wax Museum did the same year. In addition, Wax Museum gives Atwell more to do and has a far more clever script. Zoo is more or less devoid of witty dialogue, whereas Wax Museum is packed with it. I&apos;m comparing the two movie because both are famous examples of movies produced before the enforcement of the Code and both are of the same comedy thriller genre popular at the time.\n\nDespite its shortcomings Murders in the Zoo is well worth watching for people interested in so-called (and incorrectly named) pre-Code flicks, comedy thrillers from that era, and certainly for fans of Atwell.",

The pacing is done very well for those that like to think--enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on, and questions keep arising which are later answered, producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebrally and from an action standpoint.\n\nIt seems some people were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this film--one of those that comes charging out of the gate. This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill--creating a wonderful sense of anticipation--and is ultimately, in my mind, more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid.\n\nExcellent film.",

Directed Marian Dora has created one of the most vile, repulsive and disgusting films I&apos;ve ever seen. Having seen all the Italian cannibal films I thought I could handle anything but that wasn&apos;t the case with this film. Just how bad was it? I actually had to stop the film and throw up once. Reluctantly I went back and watched the film and just grew sicker and sicker. The film leaves nothing to the imagination and shows us everything. The director has only around ten lines of dialogue and everything else is just built up with atmosphere and mood. This atmosphere is of pure nastiness and this comes through in the final third of the film where the killing and eating actually starts. Apparently this film follows the real events very closely and lets just say it starts with a penis being cut off, fried and then eaten. This is where I lost it but the film keeps going. It&apos;s hard to rate this film because it&apos;s technically well made but I really can&apos;t recommend it to anyone due to the subject matter and brutality."

      "reviewBody": "Its a good concept that delivers an interesting movie about love, memories, regret and secrets. The film lives from its wonderful cast who are all very well picked and delivered good performance, however it suffers from its rather weak direction by Michael Amereyda who tried to make it too artsey for its own sake. Lois Smith delivers a great and charming performance. And I am glad she got some material to work with actually instead of just second hand supporting roles as usual. She really got talent and gave her role a lot of good and interesting facettes. Another great performance came from Geena Davis. One of her best recent performances. Davis really understood her role, which surely wasn&apos;t easy and the audience was easy to care for it, at least I did. Tim Robbins was also fine and did have some good and difficult moments. Also not a bad performance by Jon Hamm who might have had the most difficult role but mastered it well enough, even if he appeared a bit wooden, which was intentionally. But what was it with that annoying score/soundtrack? That really played the movie down which is a shame. It had a lot of potential but they tickled the wrong ankles at times. Too bad. Still worth to see for the performances.",

He rejects her, so I doubt his balls are intact!  Then she gets pissed and lashes out at him with a whip.\n\nI suspect this movie is some brunette&apos;s fantasy about brutalizing the blondes they are jealous of, since the slave girls are all blondes, and the mistress race is all brunette."

It is not a good place for a newcomer to Hou&apos;s films to start (try &quot;Mambo&quot; for that), and not a good film for the impatient.

      "reviewBody": "&apos;1900&apos; is a historical film that has a history of its own, one that probably hasn&apos;t ended yet. The perception of critics and the public about this film seems to have changed several times already during its hectic launch in 1976. Made four years after the success but also after the scandals sparked by &apos;Last Tango in Paris&apos;, the film has benefited from generous funding and full creative freedom for director Bernardo Bertolucci. How did he use the freedom and the funds he had at his disposal? Making a monumental film. Monumental in terms of duration, which made it non-screenable in cinema halls in its full format over five hours. Monumental with a distribution gathering on screen some of the great international movie stars of the 70&apos;s. Monumental also in style and as a cinematic genre - a 45-year historical fresco of the history of Italy, between the day of Verdi&apos;s death in 1900 and the day of Mussolini&apos;s death in 1945. Those who study historical monuments know well that even the most beautiful and the more impressive are in most cases programmatic, insist on transmitting a political or patriotic message or both, and are not a good source for discovering and presenting historical truth. This is what happens with &apos;1900&apos; which is a spectacular film, with many memorable scenes, with wonderful actors in generous roles, but which is deeply distorted by a much too explicit political message, reflecting the director&apos;s political ideas in an almost propagandist style.\n\nI viewed the full version of the film, which is presented today at festivals or cinematheques in two series, each over two and a half hours. This is different of what most viewers saw on screen in the 1970s - shortened versions (there were several) - perhaps more accessible for the endurance of the viewers, but also losing much of the epic construction of the film, which has its purpose. It is the story of two boys born on the same day of the first year of the 20th century. Alfred Berlinghieri (who will grow to be Robert De Niro) is the offspring of a big land owners family in an agricultural area of Italy, whose patriarch is his grandfather (Burt Lancaster, as descending from &apos;The Leopard&apos; in the role he had played 13 years ago). Olmo Dalco (who will grow up to be Gérard Depardieu) is born into the family of peasants deprived of any property and rights, who work on the estate under semi-slavery conditions. The conflicts of the grandparents are transmitted from generation to generation until the two boys born under the same sign and separated by a social abyss. The relationship between them, marked by friendship, rivalry and class struggle, will develop throughout Italy&apos;s troubled history, which includes two world wars, the rise and fall of fascism, and the popular revenge that followed.\n\nFrom an artistic perspective, &apos;1900&apos; has many sublime moments, it can be said that it is almost a masterpiece. First of all the acting performances: De Niro who was acting here just after &apos;The Godfather: Part II&apos; and &apos;Taxi Driver&apos; lends to his character all the parasitic insecurity and the degenerate vulnerability of the descendant of a social class that is fighting oblivion. Gérard Depardieu creates here, I believe, his first big role, full of strength and passion. Exceptional is also Donald Sutherland, an actor who has never hesitated to take on negative composition roles, here being the fascist Attila Mellanchini, an exemplary villain. It adds much authenticity to the use of amateur extras, the inhabitants of the Italian region where the story takes place. The cinematography includes many memorable takes, in some cases serving as backdrops for scenes carefully constructed and choreographed, in the good style of Italian operas, even including songs and dances. What works well in operas on stage, however, is not necessarily suitable for a cinematic historical fresco. The excess of propaganda rhetoric finally harms the message and sounds strident and unconvincing today. There are far too many revolutionary speeches in &apos;1900&apos; of the kind that were more suited to Soviet films of the 1930s or scenes that touch the ridicule such as the one in which a simple peasant hero chooses death for the pleasure of whistling a revolutionary song in the nose of the fascists. The Marxist Bertolucci chose to present an explicit revolutionary vision, which was more in line with the propaganda on the other side of the Iron Curtain in those years, but as far as I know his film was not successful there or not even distributed in many Communist countries because of its naturalistic approach soaked with too much nudity and violence for the puritanistic communist censors. Only today, in perspective, from the historical distance created by time, we can enjoy the many cinematic delights of &apos;1900&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "This was not one of Julie Christie&apos;s greatest roles, as she plays a very prim and up-tight British governess who goes to work for a rich family in the Argentine countryside in 1930. She has little opportunity to show any emotion, and spends most of her time trying not to. It is a strange tale and a strange film. The direction by Maria Luisa Bemberg is rather wooden and uninspired. The editing is absolutely terrible, and when a train pulls out of a station you can be sure we see too much of it doing so, the concept of cutting away seemingly having little grip on the editor&apos;s awareness. Several of the Argentine cast of this film, which is mostly shot in English, are very good, but as their names mean little to those of us in other parts of the world, there is little point in mentioning any of them individually. There are some bizarre political statements as full-screen text at front and back of the film, which make no sense, the last informing us that after 1945, Peron transformed Argentina forever. I don&apos;t know what that has to do with the price of tea. Was the film made under censorship rules? Who knows? Several times, members of the rich family ask Julie Christie: &apos;Do you think we have too much money?&apos; Perhaps the script writer was a closet socialist? Are we meant to be witnessing the decadence of the rich? This is never made clear. The madness of the mother and the older daughter are tragically portrayed, and the acting is good. The puppy love of the son for Julie Christie is extremely well done, and the actor most convincing. Most of the fascination of this film, which jumps confusingly back and forth in time over a period of 15 years, is the intense portrayal of the claustrophobic atmosphere of the rich family in their huge house in the middle of a very flat nowhere, surrounded by servants and cattle and with too little to do. We get sucked into this, partially because a real house and real locations are used, and it is all so authentic. The costumes are impeccable, and all the men spend all their time in perfect white suits which are never soiled and do not seem to wrinkle. The mad mother constantly plays Erik Satie&apos;s &apos;Gnossiennes&apos; on the grand piano, very badly, but as it goes on for the entire film, it is in the end an effective if somewhat haunting and demented motif of isolation. We don&apos;t see films like this very often, and it is many years indeed since the films of Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, such as &apos;Summerskin&apos;, excited the film critics of New York and briefly and powerfully reminded people in the outside world that there is a country called Argentina which actually exists &apos;down there&apos;, wrapped in its own dream. If it weren&apos;t for the brilliant Borges, the memoirs of W. H. Hudson, the corrupt Eva Peron, and the magnificent tango, we might not even know that much.",

      "reviewBody": "Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) was once a popular cheerleader and a person of envy, back in those high school years. However, she has made some questionable choices since then and now works as a home cleaner to support herself and her young son, Oscar. She does a have a back-up system in her wheeler-dealer father, Joe (Alan Arkin) and in her frequently out-of-work younger sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), if she needs babysitters. She calls upon the eccentric Norah often, especially so that she, Rose, can have a late-night tryst with a married policeman, Mac (Steve Zahn). Ouch, she is still going in the wrong direction, it seems. However, Mac does give her a work tip. If she could get into the &quot;crime scene&quot; cleaning business, she would be pulling in large bucks, as removing blood stains is big stuff. Receiving some leads, Rose does begin to get some assignments, like cleaning up after suicide victims and folks that die in their slovenly homes. Reluctantly, Norah agrees to help and &quot;Sunshine Cleaners&quot; is born. But, with Oscar still having trouble in school and with Mac continuing to string her along in the love department, will Rose really rise above her present circumstances? This is a fine film about people who work hard and get nowhere. First, the cast is great, with Adams, Blunt and Arkin delivering terrific performances, ones worthy of honors. Blunt, especially, is a treasure as the unconventional woman, haunted by past circumstances, and having trouble fitting into &quot;modern&quot; existence. The lesser actors are also nice, but Zahn is, unfortunately, given no chances to show off his comedic touch. The setting in New Mexico is also lovely, while the costumes and look of the film are likewise wonderful. That said, special mention should also go to the very fine, sharply worded script and the secure direction. This is a heart-grabbing story, with unusual elements and unsettling realities. If you love films that are not of the typical, churn-em-out variety, this one is definitely a worthy choice. It is as illuminating as sunshine and as touching as they come.",

      "reviewBody": "This desert epic was filmed in 1956, but wasn&apos;t released until two years later.  The producers obviously put some money into this, as evinced by some of the epic-style footage, exotic locales, large numbers of extras and horses, costumes, etc.  However, the film on a whole fails to hit the mark, showing to disadvantage in black-and-white, even though it was filmed originally in color.  Like most drive-in prints, the film is only available in black-and-white, and Italy is no help in unearthing a color version. Riccardo Montalban plays well, but the beautiful Carmen Sevilla steals the program, as she secretly woos Montalban under the nose of her tyrannical father (played by Gino Cervi).  Cervi acted suitably in low-budget, as well as high budget, adventure tales, but seemed to avoid the former, this one being an exception.  As for the music, Sevilla sings a song entitled &apos;Destiny,&apos; but the rest of the score is a tawdry re-hash which becomes repetitive after awhile.  Fernando Cerchio was responsible for putting the finishing touches on this film, and perhaps for doing most of the directing as well.  Overall it is a decent film, which enjoys an occasional second or third viewing."

      "name": "Violent film about a peculiar trio , including action-packed , drama ,  glowing cinematography and uninhibited performances",
      "reviewBody": "Entrepreneurs Ben (Aaron Taylor , though Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Garrett Hedlund and James Franco were considered to play him) , a peaceful and charitable marijuana producer, and friend Chon (Taylor Kitsch received training from real Navy SEALs as a part of his preparation and he performed his own stunts) , a former Navy SEAL, run a lucrative, homegrown industry - raising some of the best weed ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with Ophelia (Jennifer Lawrence was originally cast as O but she pulled out ,Blake Lively was subsequently selected , Director Stone instructed her to take firearm training for her role ; despite not being experienced at the gun range, she hit center mass in her first three shots) . Life is idyllic in their Southern California town... until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena (Michelle Rodriguez and Zoë Saldaña were considered for the role as Elena, but Salma Hayek got the role instead) and her enforcer, Lado (Benicio Del Toro) , underestimate the unbreakable bond of the three friends, Ben and Chon - with the reluctant assistance of a dirty DEA agent - wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills.\n\nThis thrilling film contains noisy action , lots of violence , sexual scenes , plot twists and unpleasant characters . Acceptable protagonist trio , Taylor Kitsch as Chon , a violent and tough ex-Navy SEAl , a gorgeous Blake Lively and the best acting is given by Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a sensitive young who turns into violent one to save his girl . Good support cast plenty of nasty , ominous villains well played by Mexican actors such as Demian Bichir , Benicio Del Toro , Antonio Jaramillo , Joaquin Cosio , though bear offensive racial stereotypes . Special mention to Salma Hayek , whose character of Elena is loosely based on Mireya Moreno Carreon who&apos;s known to be the first Mexican female boss cartel . Colorful cinematography by Daniel Mindel , this is Oliver Stone&apos;s first film in nearly 17 years to be photographed with Panavision anamorphic lenses . Adequate and lively musical score by Adam Peters . \n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Oliver Stone , though includes excessive violence , sexual scenes and unpleasant issues . Stone appears in a cameo as a dancer on the France cardboard skit . Oliver Stone began working on the screenplay adaptation before the book was published . So confidant he was of this story that he himself contributed to investing in the project . ¨Savages¨ is realized in frenetic style and fast-pace , similarly other Stone hits such as ¨Natural born killers¨ or ¨U turn¨ . Oliver Stone is a good professional , though usually panned by mostly critics , nowadays is best considered . Stone returning from the Vietnam war did his first film , it was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), followed by the gritty horror film Seizure (1974) for which he also wrote the screenplay . The next seven years saw him direct two films: Mad Man of Martinique (1979) and this The Hand (1981) . He also wrote many screenplays for films such as Midnight express (1978), Conan (1982), and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first Oscar for Midnight express (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show .",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Thursday&apos; is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. If you have seen &apos;Goodfellas&apos;, &apos;Reservoir Dogs&apos;, &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos; and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from &apos;Thursday&apos;. There is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in Tarantino&apos;s &apos;Reservoir Dogs&apos;.\n\nStill, it is a good movie. Because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. The opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. We&apos;ve already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.\n\nThen we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but used to be working with Nick. She doesn&apos;t know a thing. Then Nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. We learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.\n\nWhat happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters, all interested in the money or the drugs Nick also had with him. Casey has flushed those down the drain.\n\nVery funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by Skip Woods.",

He is too deeply in with the Soviets whose agents liked him better when he was single and instruct him to get rid of her. There is not much of a sense of peril generated, but the film develops a fair degree of tension when Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s character discovers the truth about her husband, as the Soviets warned him she would. The crux of the film seems to deal more with his emotional needs that conflict with his Marxist political ideals, though those ideals and the whole existence of being a spy and traitor to one cause while being coldly manipulated by agents of the other could have been done more convincingly (see The Spy Who Came In From The Cold) or one of Carol Reed&apos;s tortured espionage tinged films. Nonetheless, it&apos;s a pretty decent part for Robert Taylor while somewhat shortchanging Elizabeth&apos;s.",

But I sincerely don&apos;t believe that there is much else funnier than Dom Deluise sliding down a railing, dressed in drag. I&apos;ve dreamed of this movie after watching it, and even the dream was funny. I admit, the humor isn&apos;t very high-brow, but that&apos;s OK. The &quot;I have to use the can!&quot; and &quot;get happy&quot; sequences are pretty funny. Like I said before, the movie isn&apos;t going to stimulate anyone intellectually.

      "reviewBody": "I have seen this movie many times already. Each time I&apos;m impressed by the way Lone Scherfig knows how to tell the story of 3 children and their way of surviving without parents. Of course, the actual story is slightly incredible. Children in Denmark will probably not be subjected to this form of abandonment. However, coming from a one parent family, I can safely say that Miss Scherfig has succeeded very well in showing what it feels like to be left without parental help. And for most of this world, the abandonment of children is a sad truth.\n\nOn top of that there&apos;s humour, good lighting and last but not least, very good music. Take for instance the scene where Kasper is harassed in school and finally flees. This scene is perfectly supported by the music. From the start of the trouble to the actual flight from his school enemies, the music amplifies the dramatic development.\n\nImpressive.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh, what a wonderfully small and intricate film this is!  How I love and cherish the world I am pulled into every time I see this film.  Robert De Niro&apos;s directorial debut proves strong and lively, evidenced by how he stuck to a topic close to home; a young, impressionable Italian kid growing up little Italy in the late 60&apos;s.  As the naive protagonist Calogero, or &apos;C&apos; as he is nicknamed, Lillo Brancato gives a great performance as a young man torn between the working-class honesty displayed by his strict father and the ruthless world of organized crime demonstrated by the neighborhood crime boss Sonny (Chazz Palminteri adapted his own play and cast himself as a burly, laid back, world weary know-it-all).\n\nOne key element that snags you in is the narration.  Like equally personal films of its stature (Scorsese&apos;s gangster trilogy, &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; &quot;Election,&quot; &quot;Bringing Out The Dead&quot;, &quot;SLC Punk!&quot;), the voice-over guiding brings you in even further into the already detailed landscape and story presented. I don&apos;t really consider this a mafia movie, it&apos;s much more of a coming-of-age tale.  However, the background De Niro provides is so intimate and thorough that you wish for another film chronicling the life of Sonny.\n\nI have to admit that, for a debut, De Niro&apos;s judicious use of music seemed to rival that of Spike or Scorsese in turns of effectiveness.  First of all, De Niro kept a much more grass roots approach, sticking to doo-wop, soul, rock, &quot;mobster pop&quot; (Dean or Frank) and a little jazz.  Whereas Scorsese will use anything at his disposal (&quot;Casino&quot; had two Devo tunes in it), De Niro really seems to search for what really makes the scene.  My favorite is the scoring of a street fight scene to &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot;... De Niro must of knew before we did it was all in the violins.  De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn&apos;t want to repeat anything, so he viewed Scorsese&apos;s mobster trilogy to see what already had been done. It&apos;s obvious he paid attention.\n\nEven De Niro himself knows a little Italy gangster film is not complete with at least a surprise-ending cameo from you know who..."

According to sources,the films were screened side by side (like Chelsea Girls from the year before). A majority of the films were fairly short (most of them were only 30 minutes), but a one time only screening of the eight hour plus opus,&apos;Imitation Of Christ&apos; was also on view for those with the back bone for it (&apos;Imitation would eventually be re-edited down to a fourth of it&apos;s original running time for a wider release). Also included was the infamous film, &apos;F**k&apos; (which would eventually be re-titled &apos;Blue Movie&apos;)was also on tap. The (obvious)high water mark for the film(s)was the music score,which included (among others)The Velvet Underground (sorry,no soundtrack record album of the music from &apos;****&apos; was ever made available---at least I don&apos;t think so,in the legal sense anyway---perhaps a bootleg may exist somewhere). The films starred the usual contingent of Andy Warhol&apos;s Factory hanger on&apos;s, including (but not limited to)Ondine,Nico,Jackie Curtis,and others. Obviously not rated by the MPAA (which had not even implemented it&apos;s rating system,yet),but as any other Warhol production, contains nudity,on screen sexuality,pervasive language,drug use &amp; other material that junior probably should not be subjected to (&apos;Blue Movie&apos;would eventually land itself the requisite &apos;X&apos; rating when it was given an independent release the following year,when &apos;****&apos; was dismantled &amp; most of the reels were stashed away in Warhol&apos;s closet)",

      "reviewBody": "Crazy chaos and probably not that sweet for most. At least that&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking. I mean it starts off with one of the best known - well native Americans in German film history called Winnetou. Now of course that was a timely reference back then and some may not really get it nowadays. But it is nice to see the actual actor reprising his famous role. It&apos;s not nearly as nice seeing Gottschalk trying to be Old Shatterhand. Actually it is painful, even if it is meant to be funny.\n\nThere are many 80s references and depending on your taste and liking that will flow with you or it won&apos;t. From including Michael Winslow (of Police Academy fame) to references to shows and things that were quite &quot;hot&quot; back then (like Miami Vice). The actors obviously had a lot of fun doing this and some of it does translate onto the screen ... not all just some. Of course if you don&apos;t mind, you probably will like it more than what I&apos;ve rated it, but those not even familiar with some of the stuff mentioned here, it may be quite the torture watching this ... (and they did a sequel to this? I guess it was easy just throw anything at the wall and see what sticks ... ah well!)",

Its a very typical mad doctor flick with some luchadores thrown in. Decent performances by the main cast and entertaining fighting sequences are some of the best aspects of this movie.\n\nIts very obvious that El Santo wasnt being made into a star yet, his voice isnt even dubbed like in later films, he just falls into the background for most of this movie. People driving, sneaking around and kidnapping others are some of the things that take most of the screentime, not the best or most enjoyable entry but its enough to keep you amused.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Godfather Death&apos; is one of Brother Grimm&apos;s most interesting stories and also one of their darkest. It does stand out among the rest of their stories, not just because of the comparitive lack of fairy-tale elements and comparitively grimmer tone but also on a thematic level and that it concentrates a lot on the characters&apos; weaknesses. Thematically, with its themes of greed, revenge, fate and free will, some of it is quite heavy and thought provoking stuff.\n\nDEFA&apos;s 1980 version of &apos;Godfather Death&apos; is one of their most overlooked and lesser known, perhaps because it was not released cinematically and instead made for television. But also because it is one of their darket, visually and narratively, and relatively atypically so. It is sad that that is the case, because in my mind their version of &apos;Godfather Death&apos; is one of their best and most interesting films. Also think the Grimm story itself should be better known somewhat, it is in the shadow of stories that have more exposure in film and media in general, ones that are lighter in tone (even the gruesome elements of their version of &apos;Cinderella&apos; has nothing on it), have elements that people associate typically with fairy tales and are less heavy thematically, and it doesn&apos;t deserve to be. Just to say, the film was seen as part of a quest to see and review as many East German fairy tale films as possible and it has been a more than worthwhile one.\n\nLike some of DEFA&apos;s other films, occasionally the acting is on the slightly theatrical side but really found so little to criticise.\n\nIt looks great, made for television and non-large budget films don&apos;t always look good and can look cheap in an amateurish way, &apos;Godfather Death&apos; isn&apos;t like that. There is a much darker look to the lighting and the colours and the sets are more subdued compared to other films of theirs, that was not evidence of under-budget and was actually perfect for the tone of the original story. The costumes are especially good and the film is beautifully photographed with a lot of atmosphere. The music is a perfect fit and is a lushly and atmospherically orchestrated score on its own too, so a good example of a score that works within the film and independent of it. Especially liked the use of the harp.\n\nThe dialogue didn&apos;t come over as awkward to me, nor did it veer on the wrong side of camp, treating the themes thought-provokingly and not under-developing or trivialising them. The direction is technically assured and does well with balancing the varied characterisation. The story respects the source material, with it being true in spirit without being too dark so target audience shouldn&apos;t come into question, and manages to be even grimmer than it, not an easy feat. The ending is different and even more downbeat, but it is one where a box of tissues should be at the ready.\n\nDieter Franke especially excels in the acting department as the titular character, the meatiest of the characters, creating a formidable presence that is different from his experience in comedy. He is well matched by Jan Spitzer (occasionally over-doing it but mostly no problem), their chemistry being crucial in the film&apos;s success as it is something that drives the story and it scorches.\n\nConcluding, more than well worth tracking down. 9/10",

Typically, one or more of this group are mentally unhinged which adds to the suspense, but that set up has been a cliche for decades now.\n\nWWZ takes the opposite approach. It takes the mile high view through the eyes of one scientist, who travels the globe trying to solve the dilemma.\n\nThe action pieces are imaginative and large scale. Interestingly, the final sequence is scaled right back down to the handful of isolated people for contrast.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting to read of all the behind-the-scenes troubles that plagued the making of this movie. In spite of it all, it all came together to create a very gritty and entertaining movie.\n\nI would like to see a sequel to this movie. Pitt&apos;s character could put in an appearance, but it could be about a completely new group of people. This movie certainly left that possibility open, but it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s ever going to happen.",

His work there had instructed me as to his genius, so when &apos;Hospital&apos; appeared on TMC, I was anxious to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this film and &quot;Network&quot; it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity, inanity, and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises (e.g., hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit, and all of it delivered with a knife-edge sense of utterly black humor. &quot;Hospital&quot; is as black of a comedy as &quot;Network&quot; is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, does his work full justice. This is a keeper; definitely not to miss.",

Again, it violates the main principles of the documentary school by showing rather beautiful b&amp;w images than important things. Its documentary value seems evident, though. This is a symphonic cascade of documentary images, in the manner of &apos;Koyaanisqatsi,&apos; &apos;Manniskor i stad&apos; and so forth. It is fascinating just to see what the people, clothing, uniforms, vehicles, streets, parks, restaurants, shops, theaters, nightclubs, and factories look like in this post-modern age of ours. The brutal, Stockhausen-like musical score is vitally important to bring this film to life. Visually, quite an experience.",

      "reviewBody": "June Knight is a London musical star with little talent but a huge press following.  Bit players Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier nearly get cut from her show.  They can&apos;t believe the fuss that the press makes about her lost dog, because the dog was only lost a few minutes. They devise a publicity stunt where Chevalier will stage Buchanan&apos;s murder.  If Buchanan can walk into the courtroom after Chevalier is convicted of murder, they know that they will get a lot of newspaper coverage.  The only problem is that nobody seems to care that Buchanan is missing.  And when Chevalier finally convinces the police that he is a murderer, Buchanan is mistaken for a Balkan revolutionary and is kidnapped. As Chevalier is waiting on death row, Buchanan is lined up for a firing squad in the middle of a revolution!\n\nThis long unseen British comedy by French director Rene Clair is very funny and has a lot of &quot;black&quot; humor that we don&apos;t associate with 1930s comedies. It was only released by poverty-row distributor Monogram in the United States, and then with some footage cut out.  The ingenious screenplay will keep you guessing until the end of the film.  Highly recommended!",

I like the layout of the picture, how all the people&apos;s live inter-mingled without touching each other and time started over when the next group of people started their adventure.\n\nMade in 1989, this movie still lives today, just like Elvis!  Actually, this movie will be around for a very long time.  With quirky being the &quot;norm&quot; for TV and movies now, it fits into the current movie atmosphere even more.  I think this one fell in between the time of Twin Peaks &amp; Northern Exposure on network TV and Six Feet Under and Dead Like Me on cable movie channels. \n\n This one ranks way up there with Momento as one of my favorite movies."

      "reviewBody": "In 1964 at Ashiya Air Force Rescue station in Japan, another Flight From Ashiya is launched when word of survivors on a raft in the North China Sea is heard. Two planes are given the mission.\n\nWhile on the way in flashback we see the lives of three of the men on the rescue mission with various incidents from their past. The three are Colonel Richard Widmark, Lieutenant George Chakiris, and Sergeant Yul Brynner. \n\nYou&apos;re supposed to take only essentials, but in this situation all three men are taking a lot of baggage along. Both Widmark and Brynner met and lost their true loves during World War II and Chakiris blames himself for the deaths of several people during another mission ten years earlier that both Widmark and Brynner were on.\n\nThere are some very nice flying and rescue sequences in Flight From Ashiya, aviation buffs will love this film.\n\nBest performance in the film has to be Yul Brynner the half Japanese half Polish American sergeant who decided to make a career of the Armed Services even after World War II. My guess is that Brynner probably served in the 443rd Division of Nisei and served in Italy as well as North Africa where his flashback takes place.\n\nWidmark was a civilian pilot who ran an airline in the Phillipines before World War II where he met Shirley Knight. What happens to both of them after Pearl Harbor and the invasion of the Phillipines shapes Widmark&apos;s attitudes. \n\nLast year Dennis Quaid and Ashton Kutcher did a film about the Coast Guard Rescue Force called Swimmer. A lot of Flight From Ashiya was incorporated into that film. That was a worthy successor to Flight From Ashiya.",

Visually and sonically thick as a brick, it also represents some of the highest-flying improvisatory acting you&apos;ve ever seen. Put the Godard of the early sixties in a polyester shirt, lay him down among the rummies and compulsive cases of the American gambling subculture, and fill him with equal parts beer and caffeine, and you have some idea of this thoroughly amazing, free-and-easy comedy, which has a scary undertow: the scene where George Segal tries to persuade co-addict Elliott Gould of the hollowness of the big win might be the most scarily desolate in any Altman picture."

Which he is unable too. You could argue, that is part of growing up, but it&apos;s just a theme that runs through many people and will touch a nerve.\n\nOf course the one thing our lead character wants, he doesn&apos;t get. There is always an obstacle, something that will not let him get it. For some that might feel symbolic (and the resolution this has or hasn&apos;t at the end of the movie might feel that way too), but that depends on how you view things. And that is something that has been done clever by the filmmaker here. Shooting in black and white is an art choice, but I feel it works for the general feeling of the movie",

      "reviewBody": "This film is basically a remake of The Towering Inferno post 9-11. There&apos;s a twin tower building full of people that catches fire by accident. There&apos;s no water available on the critical floors so the fire spreads. There are lots of people trapped inside the building and rescuers doing their best to save them.\n\nReally, you know what you&apos;re going to get, there&apos;s no surprises, and it all comes down to how well executed the action sequences are and whether we care about the people involved in the tragedy. For me, this film works. Granted it&apos;s Korean and subtitles take some of the tension away as your eyes are flicking to the bottom of the screen to see what&apos;s bring said. But, this film really works as a 21st Century disaster film.\n\nThere&apos;s lots of big action sequences, big fires, explosions, burning bodies, falling bodies, tons of special effects. It&apos;s all exciting stuff in a very PG sort of way.\n\nTaking advantage of knowledge gained in the 9-11 disaster, we see steel frameworks buckling, people tacking pleas to find their loved ones on nearby walls, burning debris falling from the top of the building; everything that happens to modern buildings when they burn.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the film is that there are too many characters. The film takes 30 minutes before the fire starts and in that time we meet the maintenance manager and his child, the restaurant manager, the head chef, the incompetent chef, the incompetent chef&apos;s girlfriend, the maintenance manager&apos;s friend, the rookie fireman, the fireman sergeant, the work obsessed fireman, the lottery winner, the Christian, the mother of a college student, the college student, the building manager, the building owner, the snooty woman and her dog, and so on and so on. Really, there are just too many. Cutting the number down and shortening the introduction would have improved this film a lot, allowing us to care more for fewer characters.\n\nWhilst most of the film is deadly serious, there is some light relief provided to make the film more watchable - two hours of relentless disaster is just too depressing. In particular, the character of the fireman sergeant is likable, comical, but still very serious in his actions. My favourite moment comes when he prays for, and gets, a tsunami, dozens of floors up the building.\n\nI can&apos;t imagine this film being made in America, post 9-11, and many Americans may find it too distressing to watch but, as a reboot of the disaster film genre, it&apos;s great success.",

But the film is not only about struggle, it is, in an almost unique way, a love story too; one between a woman and a lioness. Hugely popular when released, the film still has the power to move.

      "description": "This wondrous true adventure from the best-selling novel about a woman who raised a lioness and eventually set her free is beautifully photographed on the vast, golden savannas of central Africa. \n\nWhen game warden George Adamson (Bill Travers) is forced to kill a menacing lion and lioness, he and his wife Joy (Virginia McKenna) adopt their three cubs. Two are sent off to zoos, but the third is kept - a female they name Elsa - to which they have become particularly attached. When Elsa becomes a full grown lioness, the Adamsons realise that she must be set free and taught to survive on her own. A year later the Adamsons return to the savanna and are surprised by a very special welcome from their old friend.\n\nHighly acclaimed for its cinematography and music, Born Free is a story of courage and love, nature, and a relationship unlike any other ever filmed. Eureka Entertainment is proud to present the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK, in a special Dual-Format edition.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a heartily funny late sequel to it&apos;s predecessor released in 2006. In the beginning the movie gives a strong Harry Potter vibe and it was interesting how they spread out the screen time between the different characters, the ones we begin with are not the main characters for most of the movie.\n\nThere were plenty of moments that made me laugh and Christoph Maria Herbst is terrific again as King Julius. The new characters also worked well and the fun factor was definitely present. But this sequel doesn&apos;t come close to the charm and inventiveness of the first part, especially as my biggest criticism here is probably Hui Buh himself. What&apos;s frightening is that the visual effects look cheaper after so many years and the dubbing often didn&apos;t match the mouth movements very well.\n\nNevertheless, I can&apos;t hold all this against the film so drastically and as a children&apos;s film and fun entertainment for the slightly younger audience and due to my penchant for nostalgia, the film is still worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been a while since I watched the amusingly titled &quot;Woman is the Future of Man&quot; at the Quad. More than a year and 2 Hong Sang-Soo films later it remains among my favorite films.\n\nWhile it&apos;s always refreshing and welcome to see films depart from the pyrotechnics of the Hollywood school of film-making, some films&apos; subtlety and quietness are rather oppressive (Tsai Ming-Liang immediately comes to mind). I think I have a longer attention span than the average film-goer, however, I have to admit that I can&apos;t sit through all kinds of slow films. Some are worth the challenge, others end up embodying the stereotype of the inaccessible art film. Hong&apos;s film would&apos;ve looked like art house snobbery in action if not for the fact that it&apos;s made in a very straightforward manner focusing mainly on the most basic of emotions (and the complicated situations emanating from them). The style of film-making is so cinema verite, so unobtrusive, it&apos;s a joy to go beyond being a member of the audience and feel like an actual passerby. The best, most memorable celluloid stories stay in your mind as films but &quot;Woman&quot; is a story so well-told it feels more like snippets from somebody&apos;s life told by a close friend.\n\nHong Sang-soo&apos;s &quot;Woman is the Future of Man&quot; is yet another great addition to the impressive national cinema of South Korea and one that pushes me to continue exploring more of this body of work. It&apos;s raw, naked jealousy, regret, love, lust, and longing. It&apos;s a bittersweet reminder for anyone who&apos;s ever experienced romantic love and its many variations and deviations. This is it how it happens and somehow Mr. Hong has captured it through the magic of cinema.",

This movie completely surprised me and impressed me. Wonderfully directed, great script and spot on acting. Absolutely the best gay themed movie I&apos;ve seen since Brokeback Mountain and in some ways surpasses that movie. How refreshing to see a film that deals with gay characters and none of them have a disease or are all about sex. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that but it&apos;s about time we see more movies that represent the ENTIRE spectrum of the gay community. The situations here were believable...the two leads had actual chemistry and there was an overall realism to it that we&apos;ve rarely seen on screen with gay characters. This film has absolute mainstream appeal to it...Go see it and bring your friends!",

      "reviewBody": "Continuing his &apos;Trilogy of Life&apos; cycle exploring medieval literature, The Canterbury Tales by Pier Paolo Pasolini, delves into some of the tales weaved within Geoffrey Chaucer&apos;s famous stories. It explores the myriad sexual depravities and allusions with bawdy gusto, featuring almost every perversion known, from voyeurism, flagellation, homosexuality, to even the &quot;love&quot; of a watermelon. The disparate, prurient tales are interwoven with Pasolini plays Chaucer here at his writing desk, imaging his lasciviousness upon villagers. There is even a strange comic interlude paying homage to Charlie Chaplin, in the form of Pasolini regular, Ninetto Davoli.\n\nWhilst the visual style is similar to The Decameron (1970 - Dante Feretti again is art director), the stories do not intertwine as well here, which could create some confusion in the viewer. With a largely British cast (including Tom Baker, Hugh Griffith, Jeeny Runacre, and even Robin Askwith), the film film sometimes feels like a slightly less repressed 1970&apos;s British sex comedy (Carry On Canterbury, if you like). With its delight in sexual promiscuity and perversion, it is certainly one of Pasolini&apos;s less than intellectual affairs, and even fails to humour. Unless of course your funny bone is easily pleased by fart jokes.\n\nWith a bizarre finale set in hell (its visual design clearly inspired by the painting of Hieronymus Bosch), we see an over-sized Satan shitting out some plebeian folks, to the obscene delight of those scattered round the pits. Whilst this incredibly short ending is disgustingly joyous, it fails to save a very scatological film, that vies more towards the crass than the enlightening.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

One of the better elements at play here is the incredibly complex and involved storyline offering up an incredibly complex storyline. The main storyline here involving the traveler&apos;s search for the legends in the area which brings him to the particular castle in the middle of the woods and coming across the particular story about the former king who was betrayed and killed by his colleagues comes off quite nicely. The idea of this specific curse ingraining itself over the family in how they operate not just with how he&apos;s treated after arriving and observing the strange cleansing rituals and habits that come about here offers a strong starting point for what&apos;s going on. That works incredibly well with the solid Gothic atmosphere present here. Not only does the storyline come into play quite well here offering up mystic legends from the past, and long-practiced customs where the execution remains but the reasoning has been lost to time, and the stranger who gets involved with a family under a curse that is all standard elements of the style which all help to tie everything into the traditional format of the genre. The concurrent attacks and hauntings that occur once the particular legend has come to life, ranging from the encounters within the castle walls of the ghostly inhabitants and the chase out in the swamps, provide the kind of solid antics that make for a generally fun time here. There are some issues here that do bring it down. One of the main drawbacks to this one is the absurdly long and unnecessary running time that makes for a rather hard time getting into this one. With a two-hour-plus running time filled with drama involving the early stages of his involvement with the family offering up their localized customs and getting the different class-system interactions with the rest of the family so it&apos;s not all that interesting in the first stages. While it&apos;s spilling slight bits and pieces about the nature of the curse, there&apos;s a stiffness to what&apos;s going on that allows for a difficult sell in the first half where it takes a while to get going. The other factor here is a slightly disorienting issue in the final half where quite a bit of the encounters take more of a whimsical, fantasy-based atmosphere rather than being dark and disturbing genre fare that the rest of the film comes off as, which are the main versions that hold it back.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Violence, Language, and Nudity.",

This movie was influenced by Film Noir, the French new wave, and neo-realism; which makes an interesting cocktail. Set in the Buenos Aires of the early 60s, it tells the story of a down-and-outer who has aspirations of stardom, rather like the Dustin Hoffman character in Midnight Cowboy of several years later. &quot;Gardelito&quot; thinks of himself as a great but undiscovered singer who has to resort to certain shady dealings to get by while he waits for his big break. The overall mood is ominous &amp; dark, a criticism of the social status picture of Buenos Aires in those days. You see his ultimate fate in the first scene and that sets the tone for what follows. It&apos;s well acted, with a musical score that borders on the avant-garde. A tense and brooding pic, definitely watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "Northern Pursuit (1943)\n\nA solid, serious film that shouts its political message too loudly, but is so unusual, and potentially scary it remains interesting for anyone into WWII films. Truly fascinating is the setting—the north woods of Canada in winter—and the involvement of Native Americans, who side with the Nazis for the simple reason that that means siding against Canada. (This is addressed in some brutal killings partway through.) The key plot idea is that a group of expert Nazis might actually sneak into remote areas of the country to perform acts of sabotage.\n\nThe movie audience here is mostly in the United States, to be sure (Canada&apos;s population is so small it is always a secondary concern from the studio&apos;s point of view). And the leading actor, Errol Flynn, takes on the larger issues well. That is: devotion to good, personal sacrifice to defeat the enemy, and providing an example of moral uncertainty resolving itself as the circumstances become clear. The issues he faces (in Canada) applied to the U.S. equally.\n\nCanada, to be sure, entered the war officially with Great Britain in 1939. But by 1943 the U.S. was also officially fighting. Cooperation between the two neighbors was a given, overall, but they had different national priorities to smooth out. Flynn was so famous at the time, despite (or because of) some personal scandal, he carried the movie. \n\nBut it&apos;s cobbled together stuff, quasi-propaganda. None of it was shot in Canada, though it&apos;s convincing enough. The romance is really almost superfluous, but it gives of course the audience that extra layer to swoon about, briefly. Most viewers will find a lot of this formulaic and rough sledding, but it isn&apos;t terrible, and the themes have lasting power.",

Rolf Thiele (once a promising director, 1958: Das Mädchen Rosemarie) next had no idea to make the script into an at least watchable film, but maybe he did not understand the material either. On top of all this is Heinz Rühmann whose performance is that of uninspired routine; surely one of his worst films.\n\nThere is one moment of special interest. Rudolf Forster (82 years) plays a bit part as butler. That it had to come this far for the great actor; how sad, but he does it gracefully."

Normally, Quinn is an actor that I find hard to watch, however, this role was tailor-made for him. \n\n&apos;The 25th Hour&apos; is unlikely to ever find a large audience in the future, or be re-released. Such a pity. Anyone undertaking media studies now or in future years would surely find a wealth of cinematic technique and craftmanship contained in this epic story. One of the other reviewers, here on IMDb, has rightly classed this timeless film as &quot;a forgotten gem&quot;. Spot on. It&apos;s refreshing to find an original slant on anything from WWII. This movie is totally unique. Well Done to all those involved in its making."

This is probably because of the time difference - thing truly were different nearly half a century ago. The Memorial Day (May 4) sequence is touching and brilliantly filmed. Haanstra found some WW II footage and re-shot those locations after 20 years with some nifty editing. The(Dutch) commentary was written and spoken by Simon Carmiggelt, a Dutch word smith par excellence, by Haanstra&apos;s invitation. I noticed that Carmiggelt knows when to be quiet and let the images speak for themselves. The English VO is by Peter Ustinov. This film is often &apos;accompanied&apos; by the ten minute short &apos;Zoo&apos;, Haanstra&apos;s observations of humans in the Amsterdam zoo Artis. In many instances he placed the camera inside the cages, giving us a look at humans from the animals&apos; perspective. A pearl!"

It is not clear whether they are brave or stupid.\n\nScheider&apos;s role is lamentably too small to have an impact despite top-billing. It&apos;s the kids we care about despite their immaturity.\n\nThe writer/director knows we&apos;ve seen it all before, so while the film is played straight, the tongue is firmly in his cheek. The humour is not out of place, but the frights are genuine.\n\nStay tuned for the wrap-up, it&apos;s satisfying though you will feel like a victim of a practical joke. The fate of the surviving two teenagers might have made a great sequel.\n\nReally, what does happen to characters in horror movies when the &quot;horror&quot; is over?"

I say &quot;as it stands now&quot; because, although I may be wrong, the film has the feel of an unfinished work. Clocking in at a mere hour and five minutes, however, it still manages to feel long somehow -- essentially, we are watching either one of four types of scene: The lead actor reminiscing about the now-ended affair (from his walking trip of... Antarctica!), the couple attending concerts (always, apparently, at the same venue), the couple cooking and eating, or the couple having sex. There is relatively little dialog. The film feels fragmentary, as the scenes tend to repeat without much of a contextual base; perhaps these scenes are intended to represent the lead characters&apos; memories, implying that we only remember those things that were most important to us from a relationship. The actors are game in their roles, although Ms. Stilley -- who has the long-limbed, small-chested appearance of a runway model -- comes off a bit weaker next to Mr. O&apos;Brien (indeed, this appears to be her first film). I give both actors a lot of credit for baring themselves so unabashedly to the material, but am a bit disappointed that, even though Ms. Stilley has supposedly been offered another role in Mr. Winterbottom&apos;s next film, she is said to be &quot;distancing herself&quot; from this picture, apparently especially after her mother in North Carolina was alerted to its graphic nature."

      "reviewBody": "Despite some very glossy MGM B&amp;W photography, as shown in the good print of this film aired by TCM, and some attractive sets and very Adrian-created costumes for JOAN CRAWFORD, TODAY WE LIVE is a film as generic as its title. It&apos;s hard to distinguish from any other triangle romance except that the war background gives it added interest.\n\nThe script is a strange affair. It&apos;s hard to believe that JOAN CRAWFORD and GARY COOPER would openly declare their deep love for each other after exchanging a few glances across a cup of tea. In the very next scene they&apos;re hopelessly in love, with Crawford feeling guilt because she&apos;s the fiancé of ROBERT YOUNG.\n\nYoung&apos;s brother is the carefree FRANCHOT TONE (who walks off with the earlier scenes in the film), while ROBERT YOUNG gets his chance to do a fair share of emoting later in the film as his role expands. It&apos;s nice seeing these well-known actors at an early stage in their budding careers and still in their prime.\n\nFor GARY COOPER fans this is nothing special, but Crawford&apos;s admirers will find that she was at the height of her photogenic, sculptured beauty despite some odd dress designs by Adrian that don&apos;t suggest anything but the studio&apos;s line of glamor during the early &apos;30s. She wears a boldly designed dress with a strange wing collar that has to be seen to be believed. It&apos;s hilarious! And that&apos;s just so she can pour tea with some dignity.\n\nThe actors all speak in clipped lines. &quot;Good girl,&quot; says Franchot Tone on several occasions, trying to sound like Colonel Blimp, I suppose. And the others too adopt a strange way of clipping phrases so they sound more British. Very funny.\n\nIt goes into darker territory in the later war scenes and there director Howard Hawks seems more at home. But for a film in which the Joan Crawford character was added as a last minute script change, she certainly gets her fair share of footage and dominates the first forty-five minutes. But the love angle is certainly a strange one. She treats Cooper with rude indifference several times during their first meeting although his behavior is that of the perfect gentleman. Shortly thereafter, she confesses she&apos;s in love with him. That&apos;s the movies for you.",

As far as movies having to be &apos;believable&apos;, well, that isn&apos;t really what most cinema is about, now, is it. No one dances spontaneously like it&apos;s choreographed; spaceships don&apos;t travel past the speed of light; martial artists don&apos;t get to fight a whole crowd of opponents one at a time. So reality isn&apos;t what we&apos;re really after here, now is it? No. What we want is to go to a movie and feel good when we come out. And that&apos;s exactly what this film does, unless you can&apos;t stand the idea of a beautiful woman being gay and being happy. Which is what I suspect so many of the people who wrote the damning reviews feel. That said, well, I can&apos;t really comment on how good or bad the acting is; I can&apos;t really tell the difference between merely average or good acting, and great acting. But I can tell bad acting (think Chuck Norris in pretty much anything; nice guy, great martial artist, terrible actor), and this wasn&apos;t bad at all. In fact, I enjoyed every moment. I rate a movie on whether I will watch it again (I will), and how many times I want to hit the pause button to do something else, and I didn&apos;t stop the movie at all. Nine out of ten stars.",

This film is best seen solely for laughs, although you&apos;de be hard-pressed to find it anywhere nowadays. The acting is typically dire, the plot is the usual bizarre pastiche of old fairy tales, and Tom Thumb keeps changing size. I saw it here in Britain a few days ago on a program which makes fun of B-Movies... I thought that it was quite funny, but I expect that in it&apos;s complete form it would be torture to watch. My Advice: See Snow White and Rose Red, another Childhood Productions classic."

Admittedly, a lot of it is VERY dated, but we can understand that. To be certain, a specific shot of Lori Nelson must have given millions of boys their first carnal experience. Of course, one of the most significant things about this movie is the appearance of Clint Eastwood in his debut: he plays the lab technician who can&apos;t find his mouse. Dirty Harry isn&apos;t feeling so lucky in that scene after all! Anyway, it&apos;s the sort of movie that you just watch to enjoy. They must have had fun making it. Also starring John Agar (Shirley Temple&apos;s first husband).\n\nLike I said: millions of boys must have LOVED that one shot of Lori Nelson!",

      "reviewBody": "This is such a sweet, wonderful movie - a slice of 1900&apos;s America that probably was never so perfect, but we would like to think that it was.  The storyline is not a love story between Esther (Garland) and &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; (one of the three timeless classic songs found in this movie).  The storyline is really about the whole Smith family, based on an actual family who lived in St. Louis at the turn of the century.  The real-life &quot;Tootie&quot; Smith (played by Margaret O&apos;Brien) wrote stories of her life for the NewYorker.  These stories were bought and compiled into this classic musical.  \n\n&quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; originated here, and has become a classic yuletide song.  It has been sung a thousand times by a thousand artists, but no one could ever capture the heartfelt emotion expressed by Judy Garland.  If it doesn&apos;t bring a tear to your eye as you listen to her sing the song to little Tootie, I would have to wonder if you have a heart at all.\n\nThe most fun song is &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; - you can even see that Judy herself had a ball singing it.  That scene was done in one take.\n\nJudy Garland never looked better in any of her films as she did in this one. Perhaps it was one of the happiest times in her life?  It is well-known that she married director Vincent Minelli after this picture.\n\nBeautifully directed, depicting with accuracy the passing of the seasons of one year in the life of the Smiths of St. Louis.  What a fun, charming, movie.  I could never tire of it.",

      "reviewBody": "As this is a movie about a small town, three generations and two lovers, here&apos;s how I think the story should be told. Deroy is a California isolated town, the existence of which relies on a lumber mill run by Logan Reeser (seventy-six-year-old Oscar winner Jason Robards). Reeser is a mentor to twenty-six-year old Frank (Eddie Mills) who while being seen as a freak by his family and community, fully shares Reeser&apos;s deep-rooted devotion to the giant redwoods. Then summer comes, and Frank finds himself in bliss and trouble when a romance blooms between him and the mill manager&apos;s daughter, Sylvia (twenty-four-year-old Hilary Swank, one year before her Best Actress Oscar). The young lovers are temporarily separated, but as old Logan Reeser gets deeper in debt and might have to shut down the mill, Frank and Sylvia devise a clever plan, and together they prove that love and determination can save a town from disaster and be the answer to Reeser&apos;s prayers as well...\n\nAlthough the DVD isn&apos;t very cool (only chapter selections, no special features) I really enjoy this movie. I love its message regarding environment (similar to what was voiced in such good films as &quot;Silkwood&quot;, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;...) Credits should also go to the cinematography and the solid performance of the entire cast, especially Hilary Swank with her incomparable freshness and natural beauty. So if you&apos;re tired of movies that offer nothing but senseless violence and obsessive sex crave, get &quot;Heartwood&quot; and enjoy this heartwarming love story, as narrated by its main character: &quot;It started 15 years ago in a forest in my sawmill town, Deroy, population 254, where the trees are more than a livelihood, they&apos;re a way of life...&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "This sort of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; for kids might be fun if you&apos;re a kid, since most of them get easily impressed with anything. Doesn&apos;t make much of an effort on grown ups but it has its charm, its fun moments and its few acceptable original ideas. I saw it as a fun version of &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; but without achieving its magic and realism.\n\n&quot;Josh and S.A.M.&quot; tells the story of two runaway brothers Josh (Jacob Tierney) and Sam (Noah Fleiss) escaping from their problems at home, living with their dad (Stephen Tobolowsky), recently separated of his wife (Joan Allen) who is about to marry her French boyfriend (Roland Guttman). Josh and Sam don&apos;t have much of a fun living with dad since he has two other kids from his current marriage, and they&apos;re terrorizing bullies to their &quot;new brothers&quot;. The story gets twisted, entering like a dramatic adventure when Josh says to his brother that he was genetically modified by his father as a Pentagon developed experiment to be used in wars (that&apos;s why S.A.M. in the title), so they&apos;re route to freedom ends up being than just mere running away from house problems but also because Sam can be found by the manufacturers and sent to a conflict in Africa. During their journey they make up stories, think they killed a man (Chris Penn) after an incident, and join forces with a girl (Martha Plimpton) of whom Sam thinks she&apos;s the &apos;Liberty Maid&apos;, a helpful source who gather people like Sam to hide underground (another story made up by Josh). \n\nOften dry in its humor and lacking of energy in its agitated sequences, the movie is a little dreadful, very tiring and always turning to places and situations we don&apos;t feel too much enjoyed with. And if it works for the most part it&apos;s because of Tierney/Josh smartness and creative ways to save the day while Sam keeps being one of the most annoying kids ever presented on screen with a pretentious, imaginative and unexplained intelligence, trying to be the brightest kid on Earth. It&apos;s very believable that an older brother would fake stories to involve his younger brother into something but the opposite while wanting to be wiser than wisdom itself, just doesn&apos;t work. This isn&apos;t a statement about kids not being smart or intelligent, it&apos;s just that the movie presents them with unconvincing dialogs and quotes, strangely unsuitable for a child, and if we can&apos;t believe in the story, if we can&apos;t buy its idea then the movie has failed. With your belief suspended, this even manages to be fun here and there. \n\nYes, it&apos;s a problematic plot but the film rises above some of its obstacles (even if it has to drag the viewers through strange moments). Worths a view due to the cast reunion, most of them are enjoyable in their roles - special part of this, Jake Gyllenhaal plays quite an ironic role, if taken into consideration some of his future roles, so pay attention to him, specially at the dinner scene. A little special, a little cute and fun for a Sunday afternoon. 6/10",

Her son Jack (Don Ameche) becomes an idealistic lawyer; Dion (Tyrone Power) is a gambler; and Bob (Tom Brown) helps his mother in the laundry business and marries local Gretchen (June Storey) in the old area known as The Patch. Dion meets the singer Belle Fawcett (Alice Faye) in the cabaret owned by Gil Warren (Brian Donlevy) and they fall in love with each other and become lovers. They also open a business of their own to compete with Gil that becomes their enemy. However Gil invites Dion to join the politics with him but Dion plots a scheme with tragic consequences.\n\n&quot;In Old Chicago&quot; is a film with the fictional dramatization of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. The melodramatic and romantic screenplay follows basically the fictional lives of the Irish brothers Jack and Dion. However it seems that the origin of the fire is precise with the O&apos;Leary cow starting the fire in the barn. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Na Velha Chicago&quot; (&quot;In Old Chicago&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In his most recent film, &quot;A Time for Drunken Horses,&quot; Director Bahman Ghobadi depicts the hardship of life in the Kurdish region straddling the border between Iran and Iraq.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, a truck full of children makes its way through the snowy Iranian mountains. The large group of children sing in Arabic about how the winding road makes them older. You get the sense that they don&apos;t really know what they are singing about, but the song is indicative of how many of these children will be thrust into the realities of adulthood with little warning and even less preparation.\n\nA young Kurd, Ayoub, must avert government brutality and raise the money to pay for an operation for his ailing younger brother.\n\nTheir father has just been killed by authorities and the teen must work to provide for the rest of the family. The only way he can raise the money is by smuggling goods across the border from Iraq to Iran, risking extremely cold temperatures, land mines and military raids.\n\nMuch to his credit, Ghobadi uses locals instead of professional actors throughout the film. The children who portray the three major characters (Ayoub, his sister Amaneh and their young, disabled brother Madi) give brilliant, fresh performances. Ayoub and Amaneh are convincing as a brother and sister attempting to hold their family together.\n\nThese children shed real tears. In a particularly impressive moment, Ayoub wrestles to move a drunken mule who won&apos;t budge as troops with rifles converge on his convoy. The power of his fear and frustration lights up the screen.\n\nBy the same token, some of the adult actors are unprofessional and wooden. Minor characters, like Ayoub&apos;s uncle, are painful to watch as they attempt to act. But thankfully these characters are periphery.\n\n As an artistic film coming from the Middle East, one might not expect much from the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography, however, rivals some of the slickest Hollywood productions. The sweeping ice-blue snow that lines the mountains in the film provides a stark contrast with the characters&apos; bright costumes, particularly Madi&apos;s trademark, tiny yellow raincoat.\n\nThe textured sound design adds depth to the picture. The rich, crisp amplification of even the tiniest sounds are an example of the film&apos;s attention to detail. From the buttoning of a coat to the smacking of lips, small sounds stand out and give the film an intimate feel.\n\n The film derives its title from the mules that are given alcohol so they&apos;ll traverse the snowy terrain.\n\nAt the end of the film, when Ayoub is trying to get Madi across the border, the drunken mules turn out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\n And the ambiguous final shot will make you cringe.\n\nBriskly paced, the film unearths beauty in simplicity. Ghobadi clearly is a talented director, and in this film about growing up too fast he paints a beautiful, sad picture.",

You don&apos;t really care about anyone in the movie. Linklater is a much better director and you are better off watching any other movie that either he or Billy Bob has made. A waste of money all around in my opinion. Just go and watch the original - you won&apos;t regret it. (They won&apos;t let me make my comment unless I have 10 lines of text - but I have nothing else to say. Guess I&apos;ll just have to keep typing until they let this go through. Opps not enough yet - how about this time. Still not enough - I think this will make it)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed.  I won&apos;t bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.\n\nMy only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren&apos;t sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn&apos;t nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn&apos;t really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.\n\n(2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS&apos; Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC/DC&apos;s Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again, not a big deal.\n\nOh, I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive that as well.\n\nI could probably nitpick all day, but I don&apos;t want to give the impression that this wasn&apos;t a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart, if you remember them!).  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark&apos;s face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment",

One as the Crow then as the Crow&apos;s brother. Well once again, I was mislead by Thomas Weisser&apos;s book Spaghetti Westerns the Good, the Bad and the Violent. I know it must be exhausting viewing 558 westerns. Berger actually plays only the Crow who has about 10 minutes of film time. He was very cool and great acting as the crow. Now for the others my god, I actually stomached it through the lame fight scenes and retarded town folk of five brothers and their pa. I actually had to pop a lower tab just to relax.\n\nThe duel between Link and the Crow sucked for the simple reason here is a famous gunslinger (Crow) who is being relentlessly tracked down by the Connelly&apos;s who&apos;s father was gunned down by the crow years ago. He doesn&apos;t even get his gun out of his holster fighting Link who blows him away talk about the fastest gun in the west. Link should stop being a wannabe detective and be a pro gunmen. I am actually scared to view the three other movies Director Gianni Crea made. Die-hard Spaghetti fans good luck with this one!",

      "reviewBody": "It beggars belief that the figure of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris has been portrayed only thrice on film, so far as this viewer is aware. As played by Anthony Quayle he is a minor character in John Sturges&apos; uneven &apos;The Eagle has landed&apos;, has a miniscular role in &apos;Voyage of the Damned&apos;, in the person of a totally miscast Denholm Elliott and here the magnificent performance by O. E. Hasse cannot alas compensate for the film&apos;s shortcomings.\n\nIt is not a bad film by any means but lacks the touch of a master as Alfred Weidenmann is no more than capable and in keeping with German cinema of the time has been reduced to a spy thriller with a bit of &apos;love interest&apos; thrown in.\n\nNeedless to say the utterly monstrous Reinhard Heydrich has proved far more appealing to film makers and has been personified on numerous occasions ranging from Hans von Twardowski&apos;s grotesque caricature to the quietly sinister Siegfried Loyoda to the chillingly matter-of-fact Kenneth Branagh. His uneasy relationship with Canaris is well realised in this but Martin Held&apos;s performance, for this viewer at any rate, fails to convey the sheer evil of the man. As there is no show without Punch, also featured are the always dependable Wolfgang Preiss and the ubiquitous Charles Regnier whilst Barbara Ruetting provides the Oestrogen factor.\n\nOne never really gets the feeling of &apos;being there&apos; and much of what occurs is extraneous with an eye to the commercial element. The makers have chosen to omit, amongst other things, Canaris&apos; relationship with Polish spy Halina Szymanska whilst Frau Canaris is nowhere to be seen. The film ends with his being arrested and driven away.\n\nTried for alleged complicity in the July Plot he was led naked to the scaffold and hanged on a butcher&apos;s hook. It is highly unlikely that he will ever be done justice to on screen but the sensitive playing of O. E. Hasse has at least given us a glimpse of the almost unendurable moral dilemma with which Canaris had to grapple.",

Punchline is that its untalented filmmaker Ethan Kane (apparently a darling of the AVN) ended his career at this point rather than capitalizing on such praise, retiring from porn at the tender age of 24 if you believe IMDb bio stats.\n\nOne of Adam &amp; Eve&apos;s &quot;prestige&quot; productions, it stars Ava Rose, whose performance as daughter of Indiana Jones is pathetic -poor line readings, indifferent sex scenes and zero screen presence. Kane has basically delivered an imitation of a Euro Porn film, specifically resembling the various large-scale Private Media productions of a decade back, with his European players -notably uber-sexy Roxy Panther, far outclassing the Chatsworth talent flown to Europe like Ava and co-star Bree Olson (equipped with a lousy Southern accent as some Dukes of Hazzard type shoe-horned into the script).\n\nIt&apos;s a long and dreary slog en route to the final reel appearance of dad Indy, hardly reminiscent of Harrison Ford and equipped with a thick accent hardly appropriate to even a misappropriated character of all- American origin. Low budget for supposedly a big-deal film is reflected in later reel scenes set in the Middle East that do not suggest in the slightest the proper atmosphere, likely shot near Budapest or wherever else this misbegotten feature was made."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;North To Alaska&quot; is a rollicking action filled comedy western from Director Henry Hathaway and a departure by star John Wayne from his usual westerns.\n\nSam McCord (Wayne), George Pratt (Stewart Granger) and Billy Pratt (Fabian) are partners in a rich Alaskan gold mine in 1900. They have just struck it rich and go to the local saloon to celebrate. There, a raucous saloon brawl breaks out, played more for its comedy aspects than for real. Now that he has struck it rich, George can finally send for his long suffering fiancé Jenny who lives in Seattle. Before he leaves he meets scheming gambler Frankie Cannon (Ernie Kovacs) with whom he will tangle at a later date.\n\nSince Sam has to go to Seattle to buy new mining machinery anyway, George charges him with the task of fetching Jenny back to him. In Seattle, Sam finds that Jenny has, much to her regret, since married. Sam goes to a local brothel called &quot;The Hen House&quot; where he happens to meet Angel (Capucine) who is French like Jenny. Sam decides to substitute Angel for Jenny and asks her to accompany him to Alaska. Angel as luck would have it, falls in love with Sam.\n\nBefore leaving for Alaska, Sam goes to a logger&apos;s picnic at the request of his old friends Lars and Lena Nordqvist (Karl Swenson and Kathleen Freeman). There he protects Angel&apos;s honor to the point that she believes he is taking her back to Alaska as his girl.\n\nBack in Alaska, Sam brings her to his camp to find that George is away fighting claim jumpers at another camp. Sam leaves Angel in the &quot;care&quot; of George&apos;s young brother Billy who tries to woo her for himself with comedic results.\n\nWhen George and Sam return, George is presented with Angel as a replacement for his beloved Jenny. Reluctant at first, he becomes attracted to her until he realizes that she is in love with Sam. The two then plot to make Sam jealous and well you know.\n\nMeanwhile Cannon has cross-filed on Sam and George&apos;s claim under the name of town drunk Boggs (Mickey Shaughnessy), and then the fun begins.\n\nDirector Hathaway keeps the story moving and entertaining. Wayne proves to be quite adept at light comedy in his role. Fabian surprises as the horny kid brother in perhaps the best role of his movie career. Granger, long an action star in his own right, is equal to the task as George. Ernie Kovacs who was an innovative TV comedian at this time, is wasted as the the slimy chief villain. He hardly has a chance to display his comedic talents. Capucine is lovely and captivating as Angel. Her scenes with Fabian are hilarious.\n\nThere is plenty of action from the opening saloon brawl to the logger&apos;s picnic to the fight with the claim jumpers to the final street fight. And who can ever forget the great Johnny Horton&apos;s singing of the title song over the opening credits.\n\nOne of Wayne&apos;s most entertaining pictures.",
