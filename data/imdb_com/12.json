      "reviewBody": "David Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;The Fly&quot; has always been one of my favorite sci-fi horror movies ever since watching it as a young teenager. Why? Well, there are multiple reasons for this.\n\nLet&apos;s start out with the story. It has a very interesting and disturbing story that deals with different topics without losing focus on the core of the movie. It is a story that deals with scientific issues of teleportation, but it does so in a very believable manner. But it is also the story of an aloof scientist who invents something unique and his downfall into despair and hunger for knowledge and power.\n\n&quot;The Fly&quot; also has good effects, taking into consideration that it is from 1986. Granted that compared with today&apos;s technology and possibilities, then it is outdated. But I do believe that the special effects team working on &quot;The Fly&quot; managed to create something that actually still holds its ground even today. The whole transformation from Seth Brundle to Brundlefly is just exceptional, and I mean that both in terms of the special effects and make-up applied to Jeff Goldblum, but also in the way that the character started to behave and the skills he acquired from the transformation.\n\nThen there are some outstanding performances to be witnessed in the movie. First and foremost, it is of course Jeff Goldblum who steals the screen with his enigmatic performance as Seth Brundle. I believe this was also the very first movie I saw him in. His mannerisms, behavior and that twitchy side to him is just right on the nail for this particular role.\n\nThere is just something timeless about the story presented in &quot;The Fly&quot; and it is a movie that you can watch over and over. I don&apos;t know how many times exactly I have watched it by now, but it is around ten or so.\n\n&quot;The Fly&quot; is definitely a well-worthy addition the to horror genre, and it is an outstanding movie that you should already be familiar with. If you by some strange reason haven&apos;t seen &quot;The Fly&quot; already, I can strongly recommend that you take the time to do so.",

      "reviewBody": "The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I&apos;ll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch. \n\nIt&apos;s really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is still the best because of the reason that it&apos;s simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest&quot;, when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End&quot; goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.\n\nNo doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn&apos;t knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie. \n\nThe movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.\n\nThe movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.\n\nThe action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I&apos;m mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it&apos;s CGI. \n\nMost roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton&apos;s parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can&apos;t just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom&apos;s and Keira Knightley&apos;s acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn&apos;t bother most people, unless you&apos;re a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack&apos;s father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce&apos;s and Jack Davenport&apos;s and lets not forget the Kraken.\n\nStill, I really wouldn&apos;t mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven&apos;t dried up yet.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

This is because the director/writer Brad Silberling had been dating Schaeffer when she died and like the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal, he lived for a time with her parents following this death.\n\nWhen the story begins, you might find it confusing. Joe&apos;s girlfriend had been killed....though this isn&apos;t obvious and when you find out, exactly how seems pretty vague as well. What is clear is that Joe (Gyllenhaal) is living with her parents (Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon) and he seems like he&apos;s simply going about his life in order to make them happy...sort of like a substitute for his dead fiancee. What&apos;s next? See the film.\n\nConsidering the film is about a family and boyfriend responding to the the brutal murder of a girl, it obviously is NOT a fun movie to watch. But the performances are very good and the film is unique....reasons to possibly watch it. Well made...and rather unpleasant...though fortunately the film is NOT violent and doesn&apos;t show any violence.",

      "reviewBody": "No one envied George Lazenby when he became the first actor to play James Bond after Sean Connery bowed out of the role. I can only imagine that Lon Chaney Jr. must have felt the same sort of pressure when he was signed to take over the role of Frankenstein&apos;s Monster from the great Boris Karloff.\n\nGhost of Frankenstein is, for some reason, one of the more obscure of the Frankenstein series -- I guess in the same way Lazenby&apos;s On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service is considered one of the lesser known Bond films. Coming on the heels of the Karloff trilogy, it does have a second-hand feel to it that doesn&apos;t allow the film to reach the heights of its predecessors.\n\nThis is unfortunate because the movie isn&apos;t that bad, actually. In terms of inter-film continuity it probably has the strongest ties with the previous film, Son of Frankenstein, thanks to the continuing presence of Ygor (who, for reasons never explained, survived being shot in Son of Frankenstein). Ygor continues to act as Svengali/Pied Piper to The Monster, and Bela Lugosi turns in a performance that in my opinion rivals if not surpasses Dracula. Anyone who thinks Lugosi was a one-note ham actor capable of only variations on Dracula should check out this film and Son of Frankenstein for a revelation.\n\nAs the Monster, Lon Chaney isn&apos;t bad. Being considerably stockier than Karloff, he somehow appears smaller (blame the sulfur pit, perhaps?). Chaney also chooses to play the role completely mute, a departure from Karloff&apos;s growling portrayal. There are several moments where he manages to evoke the types of emotion Karloff was capable of showing under the flat-top -- including a rather puzzling moment where the Monster recognizes Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein, the son of the original Dr. Frankenstein (maybe there&apos;s some backstory that we are unaware of?).\n\nCedric Hardwicke as Ludwig Frankenstein tries hard but is unable to produce the same sort of near-madness that his predecessors Colin Clive and Basil Rathbone exhibited, while Lionel Atwill (playing a different role than the policeman from Son of Frankenstein) has a fairly thankless and somewhat confusingly written role to play in the eventual fate of The Monster.\n\nUniversal was not known for its inter-film continuity, and although Ghost manages to tie in quite successfully with Son (if not the earlier films) there are still a few jarring continuity gaffes, the most notable being the use of a different actor for the scene when the original Dr. Frankenstein pays a ghostly visit to his son (hence the source of the title in case you&apos;re wondering) -- even though Colin Clive, the original (but by the time this film was made, sadly deceased) actor is clearly shown in a flashback sequence.\n\nGhost of Frankenstein is far from being the best of Universal&apos;s Frankenstein series, but as a middle-of-the-pack entry, it&apos;s quite worthwhile. And for serious fans of The Monster who feel that the later &quot;team-up&quot; entries in the series are abominations (that is to say Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, and Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein), then this film is pretty much the end of the Frankenstein Monster story.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Since I am no biblical scholar, my comments are those of a movie lover. Tackling any part of a story from the bible is a journey filled with land mines and aggressive criticism - and that&apos;s before your movie is released! Surely director Darren Aronofsky was prepared for backlash from those who forbid any interpretation of the Good Book. The story of Noah lasts but a few pages in the bible, meaning Aronofsky had to creatively fill some space to produce a 2-plus hour film.\n\nRussell Crowe makes a fine Noah. He is relentless in his quest to fulfill The Creator&apos;s request ... and he flashes his &quot;Gladiator&quot; glare on a few occasions. Rather than an uplifting childhood bedtime story, this Noah carries the burden of God, his own family and the survival of all beings ... his days are filled with moral dilemmas much larger than what you and I go through.\n\nWith all the miscommunication afforded by email and text these days, imagine if God conversed with you through images in your dreams. Maybe that process creates some areas of gray? Not if you are Noah. I guess he only dreams when God wants to show him something, so his decision making and mission is pretty focused. He is to build a giant floating warehouse to save two of every creature. Yes, that means a lot of death for those not invited. See, God is using Noah and his family to help cleanse the earth of mankind ... God is ready for a re-boot. He is really not happy with how mean and nasty man has become ever since that whole apple debacle and the murder of Abel by Cain.\n\nSome of the visual effects are spectacular. I especially enjoyed the high-speed montage showing the creation of life ... you know that first week. Also, the beginning of the flood is quite a spectacle, but the ark itself is actually quite stunning ... constructed per the size noted in the Bible. The animals are all digitally created and we actually see little of them, though the on-boarding process goes remarkably smooth - considering this happens before the herbal sleep concoction is disbursed.\n\nMost of the discussion will probably be on The Watchers ... the fallen angels who once tried to help mankind, and for their efforts, God turned them into giant stone creatures. I will add that The Watchers need a new nickname since they did the bulk of the manual labor in constructing the arc and then protecting it ... not much watching going on for these poor guys (voiced by Nick Nolte and Frank Langella, among others).\n\nNoah&apos;s wife is played by Jennifer Connelly and their sons are played by Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth and Leo McHugh Carroll. They welcome Emma Watson into their family in what turns into a very odd plot twist, and the villain, Tubal-Cain is payed by Ray Winstone. Methuselah, Noah&apos;s grandfather, is played to the hilt by Anthony Hopkins. All of these characters are pretty one dimensional, but this is Noah&apos;s story. The burden he carries is quite heavy and his decisions aren&apos;t always popular.\n\nIf you are looking for the well documented story of Noah, it&apos;s no mystery what book you should be reading. If you are after a pretty impressive visual interpretation, you could certainly do worse than Aronofsky&apos;s take. And the best news ... no Morgan Freeman voice-over!",

Finally, at the tormented conclusion, when Billy the kid starts to ride off, stops, turns in his saddle to look back at Jane wherein she gives him a stupid look, then smiles and jumps on the back of the Kids horse and they together ride off.

In an attempt to &apos;blend in&apos; with society, she decides to shack up with Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), a beautiful young prostitute who lives with her mentally handicapped brother, and get a job. However, when the local prostitution ring gives poor little Yuki a very hard time, our silent heroine decides to seek revenge, and, in doing so, reveals her whereabouts to the law.\n\nJudging by IMDb&apos;s current rating (7.6 out of 10), and some glowing comments by trusted, prolific authors, I expected to have my socks blown clean off by Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable. Indeed, the first few minutes, in which protagonist Nami Matsushima hacks off Kondo&apos;s arm (which is handcuffed to her) and proceeds to leg it with the severed limb dangling from her wrist, did just that (I paused the DVD to pop them back on).\n\nUnfortunately, however, the remainder of the film proved to be far less impressive, never matching the sheer audacity of the opening scene. Sure, director Shunya Ito comes close with some exploitative moments including incestuous sex between Yuki and her retarded brother, and a nasty, forced abortion, but, for the most part, Beast Stable is rather boring, being very slow in the telling and uneventful for long stretches.\n\nThe film is, of course, very stylish, and always good to look at (the stunning lead actresses certainly help there, with Watanabe obligingly getting her kit off a few times), but compared with parts one and two, this third outing for Scorpion is a tad disappointing.",

Over the years I forgot the title of it, but never the plot and Rod Steiger and of course Dolores. I never saw it TV again. I would ask people about it describing the plot but no one seem to remember it.It wasn&apos;t until I was looking over Steiger&apos;s filmography that I found out the title. I bought the DVD and watched last night and memories of years and years came back over me.The music the photography, the hopelessness. So beautiful, so sad.If you have not seen it yet, please do so. One of the most forgotten movies and one of the best performances Rod Steiger ever gave.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Driving Lessons&quot; sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when Grint&apos;s character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (Linney), and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.\n\nGrint&apos;s portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film. His portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals, and happiness, is captivating to watch unfold throughout. The film is sharply shot, and well paced, with very few moments leaving you tired, an achievement, particularly considering the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands, and successfully brings the audience to her side of things, emphasising Linney&apos;s ironic immorality throughout. Her role in &quot;Driving Lessons&quot; is enjoyable and memorable in every sense.\n\nThe plot develops nicely, leaving the audience cheering on Grint as he chases back to Evee&apos;s place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings. The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag, in a very consistent way. The overbearing, (and relieving), main idea being that religion doesn&apos;t lead to happiness, and certainly doesn&apos;t lead to morality.\n\nThe audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable Evee, with her and Grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen, transferred directly from their debut in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this Christmas.",

No, it&apos;s surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup. Everything up to then is even less unequivocal.\n\nHighly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don&apos;t mind following foie gras with a hot dog; caution to those with more refined palates.",

      "reviewBody": "This isn&apos;t really successful cinematically in the conventional sense. Usually one thinks that the cinematic values of the thing have to be stronger than the narrative values. That&apos;s so the body of what we get has blood. But sometimes the fractionated nature of how the thing is stitched together cinematically helps the narrative being. In other words, if the thing is broken in some areas, it becomes a stronger whole in others. I think that&apos;s what happens here.\n\nRegular readers of my comments know I harp on and on about narrative folding, techniques which are the basic tools of enriching narrative in general. I&apos;m particularly interested when this is done in ways that can only be done in film, like certain ways that identities can be blended or that the images that denote certain narrative milestones can be overlapped visually.\n\nWhat strikes me about this project is how formal it is. Oh, it looks sloppy and accidental. And the apparent subject matter is literally the discarded parts of life. But the ideas behind it are pretty cerebral indeed. When the French did this  made philosophical essays about the nature of life and perception  and coded it in narrative, it got pretty tiresome. And I suppose the ideas in this would be too if I saw them again. But this seems fresh. In my mind, I think of it as &quot;Tampopo,&quot; but without the humor (any humor at all) and dealing with the other end of food.\n\nThe ideas are those of quantum narrative. Nothing we see has clear edges, bones. Everything we see has already had the nourishment taken from it and is given to us as a sort of residue of life instead of life.\n\nThere&apos;s the literal notion of excrement of course. And of health not as wholeness but as a sort of moving the incomplete parts to the right places. Also of trails of cause. The literal stream is that the cast off, the residue of one life being that which nourishes, even heals another in various ways. This is given to us here as ambiguity about matters of life and death. The metaphors themselves aren&apos;t sophisticated, and I suppose the crudeness of them in matter and form is something of the point, a bodily version of beautiful violence we see in other films.\n\nI&apos;d like to point your attention to the most clever thing, what I&apos;ll call the Quantum Mechanics of the story. Actions are often accomplished by doing the opposite of what is intended. Identities overlap and scintillate. Matters of time jump, reverse and overlap. There are huge shifts that occur when you observe, and there is one segment (the core) where we watch a video of someone making a video and then watching it. \n\nThe video becomes residue, a turd and is flushed away, only to be recovered in the way that (and because of the way?) Hindu dead are flushed into a river in a manner that the water becomes cleansing. This video, of an event which is one of several life-death scenarios set in public toilets... using one of several gun-like things associated with toilets... and referencing the Jesus-Moses story in a few ways too...\n\nThis video is presented to us in an amazing compendium of ways. Focus on that if you have trouble getting a foothold here. The quantum mechanical idea is that things shift, they jump and the key driver is how and when you look at it, or if you do and how you sneak up on that barrier between being in the story (literally in the toilet) or outside, or using it or casting it off. And even that QM idea jumps about itself before you can apply it.\n\nSo look at the video here, something that appears as found (in ordinary commercial videos) and as made. Look at how we see it, the actual footage of a murder where the murderer is murdered. Where the eye jumps from one camera to the next in the most inexplicable ways (but which makes sense afterward). \n\nThis isn&apos;t just clever editing of the type that different perspectives encircle the story. It uses the same vocabulary, but the jumping about is more arbitrary, broken. And so becomes stronger. The octopus-mermaid jumps tanks. The casting off becomes the eating.\n\nYou&apos;ll like this, you will.\n\nThe ending is one of the most striking images you will see in any film, ever. A driving, Andean flute over a pulsing spacemusic guitar line. A terrain that incongruously is beach, desert and fertile plain. Is that water or sky? Is this where mountains start or where land ends? Is that forest or cloud on the left there where we desperately grasp for something to anchor our eye and give us permission to be here.\n\nSheep  I suppose  occupying the entire frame, then moving to left with growing but calm urgency. Why? An endless line of men appears from the right. Then we shift to align with them horizontal instead of diagonal. Instead of men in a place we have men arrayed, defining a place. Wait. Are they men? No they are walking like children aren&apos;t they, arms swinging as if striding into life.\n\nIts worthy of Herzog but so much more deftly set up, and may be the most engaging single image you will see all year. Years. The gentle way we leave it is almost as precious. This, my friends is what you come to see and the hour and forty minutes beforehand is mere stretching for the race.\n\nPlease see it. Perhaps we have a new Kar-Wai Wong entering our lives.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

This being said, I was rather disappointed by the lack of originality of the story. Intercutting a present day writer researching a novel playing in the past with the story of the novel is hardly an innovating idea. And the way the characters are slightly off and also their tangled relationships made me think of John Irving &quot;light&quot;, with tango dancing instead of wrestling and a whale instead of a bear. The breast cancer story added an unnecessary additional plot line, probably to create a (false) impression of seriousness and depth. I wonder what Almodovar might have done with this, though. In spite of all the criticisms, the movie was entertaining and I considered my time in the theatre and my money for the ticket well spent.",

      "reviewBody": "Pedro Ortiz (Mario Adorf) is released from prison and returns soon to free a young man called Carlos (Thomas Fritsch). Together with Jose (Klaus Kinski) and Fernando (Sieghardt Rupp), they start a new gang for bank robbery and the usual things bandits do. They take Ortiz&apos; friend Juanita (Marisa Mell) and the servile piano player Woody (Walter Giller) with them. When former sheriff Kelly (Edmund Purdom) follows them, they take his wife Liz (Marianne Koch) and his young son for hostages. During the perilous journey to Mexico, the group is reduced one by one, while Ortiz&apos; has delusions of grandeur, looking for a hidden treasure.\n\nShot on the island of Gran Canaria shortly after the success of the German Karl May westerns &apos;Treasure of Silver Lake&apos; and &apos;Winnetou I&apos;, this Austrian production tried to cash in on their success and even signed Mario Adorf, the villain of the latter. But it is totally different in tone, in a darker and more violent mood it is foreshadowing the Italian westerns soon to follow. Koch would reappear in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and Kinski in &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot;. The villain (Adorf) is in the center of the show all the time, whereas the hero (Purdom) remains pale and only starts moving when his family is in danger. On one hand, it makes the movie original to put the villain in the foreground, on the other hand, it is a weakness not to have a more memorable hero. Mixed feelings, but in any case an interesting movie on the border line between American western influences and new European western style.",

      "reviewBody": "During a series of sensory-deprivation experiments, a professor devolves into a prehistoric form of life. This bizarre yet intriguing sci-fi offering comes from Ken Russell, a genre filmmaker who&apos;s made a handful of weak films, including The Lair of the White Worm (1988) and Gothic (1986). The script comes from Paddy Chayefsky, who also wrote the book upon which the film is based. Though Chayefsky disowned the film and Russell&apos;s direction, it remains among the best films in both they&apos;re careers. The best thing about the film is easily the script, which is intelligent and thought-provoking. Russell&apos;s direction is quite good as well; the editing on this film is truly top-notch. The actors gave great performances, especially a very young-looking William Hurt as the lead. In my opinion, Blair Brown&apos;s performance was at times a little uneven, but that never hurt the movie. The make-up effects, from Dick Smith, were terrific. The imageryincluding visions of hell, a seven-eyed goat-man (how cool is that?), hideously mutated human bodies and a truly trippy vision of the creation of lifeare startling. There&apos;s some decent gore too, included a nasty gutted lizard (which looks suspiciously realistic if you ask me) and other goodies I won&apos;t spoil for you. Also worth mentioning is a great score from John Corigliano, which is unsettling and very suspenseful. \n\nThis film is NOT for everyonesome viewers might be lost by the scientific aspects of the film and the hallucinogenic scenes. If you like everything explained to you and you&apos;re afraid of a little ambiguity, this isn&apos;t for you. If you want a different, intelligent sci-fi filmsee this.\n\n7/10.\n\nJust one complaint thoughI&apos;m no scientist, but wouldn&apos;t it be impossible for a human being to survive the physical and metabolic changes of a transformation like the one seen in the film? (I know, I know, it&apos;s just a movie).",

      "reviewBody": "One quarter captivating mystery thriller, three quarters intense and relentless psychological drama, &quot;Affliction&quot; is unquestionably one of Paul Schrader&apos;s finest achievements both as a writer and as a director, and an absolutely devastating and engaging film.\n\nThe film revolves around the character Wade Whitehouse, played brilliantly by Nick Nolte in what amounts to a masterclass in acting and a career high for Nolte, a troubled small town policeman who is investigating a hunting death while his childhood comes back to haunt him through a series of events that cause him to collapse mentally. The characterization in Schrader&apos;s screenplay (and in Banks&apos; novel, I assume) is absolutely astonishing. One rarely sees characters with such detailed psychological profiles in movies as short as &quot;Affliction&quot; is. James Coburn&apos;s Oscar-winning turn as Wade&apos;s father, Glen, is also very memorable, and his part is certainly very well-written. The rest of the characters play more minor roles in the film both in thematic terms and in terms of screen time, but Schrader doesn&apos;t push them to the side and focus only on the main character. No, Sissy Spacek&apos;s character here is very detailed and important, and although her role is relatively small child actress Brigid Tierney is quite excellent as Wade&apos;s daughter.\n\nThe original score by Michael Brook is haunting and memorable and helps keep the film&apos;s intensity and atmosphere going, as does Paul Sarossy&apos;s cinematography which is suitable to say the least given the harsh setting and subject matter. Paul Schrader absolutely nails the direction on this film. Everything just feels right, the pacing is fantastic, and I&apos;m certain he had something to do with the stunning performances here. The locations are used to optimal effect, and feel just as harsh from the safety of your seat as they would in reality.\n\n&quot;Affliction&quot; may not be an easy film to watch repeatedly, as it is relentlessly intense, but it is also a highly involving and sophisticated dramatic thriller, something that is certainly becoming a rare event in American cinema. Ultimately, &apos;enjoyable&apos; might not be the best word to describe &quot;Affliction&quot;, but it is certainly impressive.\n\n9.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gervaise&quot; is an adaptation of the novel &quot;L&apos;assommoir&quot; (1877, Emile Zola). In this novel a working cass woman breaks down due to a lot of bad luck and a lot of booze. When the novel came out there was discussion if the book was defending the working class (describing their harsh live) or insulting the working class (describing their alcohol abuse).\n\nThe film above everything seems to be defending women, describing the struggle Gervaise (Maria Schell) has to wage against the two idlers of husbands that play a role in her life. This is because the film omits the excessive pride of Gervaise that she does have in the novel. This results in a totally innocent woman having bad luck again and again. This overdose of bad luck gives the film a somewhat moralistic tone (it has sometimes been denoted as a very long commercial against alcohol abuse) and even becomes unintentionally funny / corny.\n\nAlthough the film is somewhat outdates, it was one of the nominees for best foreign language film in 1956, so the film must have its pros. Apart from the acting of Maria Schell I would like to mention the beautiful setpieces. The film has partly the same bittersweet (a little bit more bitter) mood as &quot;Casque d&apos;or&quot; (1952, Jacques Becker), a film that was made and situated in the same time as &quot;Gervaise&quot;.",

So the premise is a drug deal gone awry, and told from three different perspectives, of course each providing us different takes on the same problem and how it got the characters there in the first place. Really interesting, well executed. The acting is great, especially Timothy Olyphant and William Fichtner, who stand out in my opinion. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that the people involved are just young, naive people, rather than gangsters and evil-spirited people. Timothy Olyphant&apos;s character is kinda shady, but he&apos;s really charismatic and that&apos;s an engaging quality. There is an arousing mixture of characters that constantly mess up and the results are exhilarating.\n\nGo is clearly an underrated film, and if you are reading this, I highly recommend it to you.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s plenty to be cynical about where Paddington is concerned. The first feature film about the iconic bear - red hat, blue coat, suitcase in hand - was first announced in 2007, and went through a gestation period that&apos;s extraordinarily long even for a heavily animated film. The trailer&apos;s (literal) toilet humour seemed to confirm that it was pitched firmly at kids. And last, but certainly not least, the cast experienced a shake-up of fairly seismic proportions when Colin Firth announced in July that - with the unanimous consent of all concerned - he would no longer be voicing Paddington. All signs pointed towards a disaster of a movie, one stitched together to cash in on rather than celebrate the phenomenon of Paddington, a little bear who has lived in books, TV series and cuddly merchandise around the world.\n\nIt&apos;s a flat-out joy to discover, then, that Paddington is very far from a disaster. Indeed, it&apos;s an unmitigated delight of a family film. Of course, &quot;family films&quot; don&apos;t really cater to everyone in the family a lot of the time - the phrase is a euphemism applied to movies that adults must put up with or suffer through for the sake of entertaining their children. But Paul King&apos;s Paddington, based on the beloved books by Michael Bond, really does have something for everyone and is, incidentally, an utterly lovely movie about families to boot. The young will be bowled over by the adorable bear who tumbles through London and into the hearts of his adopted family. The young at heart -and even a few older, crankier people - will find much to enjoy in the film&apos;s cheerfully subversive script.\n\nOur journey begins in Darkest Peru, where a young bear (voiced with pitch-perfect charm by Whishaw) lives happily with his Aunt Lucy (Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Gambon). He inherits from them a healthy love for marmalade and London, as well as a floppy, red felt hat left behind decades ago by English explorer Montgomery Clyde (Downie). When an earthquake destroys their idyllic home, Aunt Lucy urges her nephew to strike out to London. Many jars of marmalade later, he finds himself in the iconic train station that gives him his name. He meets the Brown family: risk- averse Henry (Bonneville), dreamy Mary (Hawkins) and their children, Judy (Harris) and Jonathan (Joslin). With Henry insisting that Paddington can only stay while he looks for a more permanent home, the bear begins investigations in London - unaware that Millicent, an obsessive, possibly crazy taxidermist (Kidman), has very specific reasons for wanting him to visit her museum.\n\nStrictly speaking, there isn&apos;t anything all that new or original about Paddington. We&apos;ve seen the trope many times before - in trying to find a new home, a misfit changes the hearts and minds of the people who will eventually become his family. The narrative of the film is also little more than a patchwork of wacky incidents and hijinks: Paddington floods the bathroom while trying to come to terms with the &quot;facilities&quot;; Paddington apprehends a criminal through sheer good luck and his incredibly honest nature; Paddington and Henry infiltrate the top-secret Geographers&apos; Guild to hunt down Mr. Clyde.\n\nAnd yet, King has crafted something quite charming and magical around the bare bones of his story. The film practically radiates love for the sweet-tempered, unfailingly polite bear at its heart. A life-long fan of the ursine hero, King peppers his script with smart references to Bond&apos;s books, from Paddington&apos;s trademark &apos;hard stare&apos;, used to embarrass people into behaving better, through to the meddling interference of nosy, thrifty neighbour Mr. Curry (Capaldi). He&apos;s also updated and deepened the story to give the elder Browns their own emotional arc: Mary&apos;s determination to open her heart and home to a stranger is what eventually leads Henry to getting back in touch with his wilder, more fun-loving side. The film also looks quite spectacular, whether Paddington is surfing down a flight of stairs in a bathtub or we&apos;re allowed a dollhouse glimpse at the Brown family as they go about their lives.\n\nMost importantly, King infuses the entire film with a practically joyous strain of comedy and wit. Pratfalls and sight gags are accompanied by deliciously silly allusions to William Shakespeare and Mission Impossible. Even the film&apos;s supporting characters get their own hefty share of comedy, whether it&apos;s housekeeper Mrs Bird (Walters) distracting a security guard by means of a booze throwdown or Mr. Curry falling instantly for Millicent to a smooth burst of Lionel Richie. Millicent herself is an inspired creation. Prowling through the film, togged out in figure-hugging snakeskin and wielding scalpels, she brings to mind and subverts the icy-cool blonde archetype most beloved of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThe sharp script and stunning visuals would mean little without a cast wholly committed to their roles, and King has struck gold with his offbeat casting choices. Bonneville, a veteran of Downton Abbey, has no problem playing Henry&apos;s constant anxiety over his children, but also gleefully flings propriety to the winds as he slips into tunic and apron for a spot of howlingly funny undercover business. Hawkins lends Mary - the loving, tender heart of the household and Paddington&apos;s biggest champion - a soulful gravitas. Great as they are, however, the MVP here is Kidman. Her fantastically manic performance as Millicent reminds us why it&apos;s a damn shame that she hasn&apos;t been in a comedy for years - she&apos;s so cheerfully unhinged in the film that she steals pretty much every scene she&apos;s in.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t matter whether you&apos;re a fan of Bond&apos;s books, someone who only knows Paddington as a cuddly soft toy, or a neophyte who has never heard of this walking, talking, marmalade-loving bear. Paddington is a big, warm bear hug of a film, one that will enchant children and tickle adults, even as it grabs just about everyone by the heart with its charm and humour.",

      "name": "Precode film with good performances",
      "reviewBody": "The plot of &quot;Illicit&quot; is similar to the plot of an early Bette Davis film called &quot;Ex-Lady&quot; made two years after this one. They should be similar - Edith Fitzgerald wrote both of them. &quot;Ex-Lady&quot; was based on an unproduced play, and &quot;Illicit&quot; actually was a play. Both concern women who don&apos;t want to get married and men who do. Anne (Stanwyck)(like Davis) is an unconventional free spirit afraid that marriage will destroy the romance she has with Dick (James Rennie). However, word gets around that the two have been weekending in Connecticut, and Dick&apos;s father (Claude Gillingwater) convinces her to agree to marry Dick. Thanks to an old girlfriend of Dick&apos;s and an old beau of Anne&apos;s, trouble brews in paradise once the rings are exchanged.\n\nThis is an early sound film, so the rhythm is off, and some of the sound has an echo. However, a few pauses that are a little too long don&apos;t really impede the fine acting. Stanwyck is wonderful and gives indication of the wonderful star she will become. She&apos;s funny, vivacious, and likable. Charles Butterworth plays a drunken friend very convincingly, and Claude Gillingwater is dignified yet warm as Dick&apos;s father. Rennie makes an attractive lover turned husband for Stanwyck. Joan Blondell has a small role as a friend.\n\nThe film is interesting because it&apos;s early Stanwyck, but also because of the independent woman angle which soon will fade from view with the ushering in of the code. Once the &apos;40s hit, the independent woman became an uptight career woman wearing a tailored suit, her hair up, and sporting a stern attitude. Young, carefree non-virgins became a thing of the past. But these precode films are what helped mold the strong images of Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck and are worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "The production values for this movie are very high. The period costumes are some of the best ever and the filming is beautiful. Even the horses are elegantly clad and the battle scene with the horses on the bridge is impressive.\n\nHowever, all of this effort does not cover up problems. Many biographies of Francis are captivating, but the story, as presented here, is quite unbelievable and never involving. After Francis&apos; conversion we see him pulling a cart through the streets asking for stones to rebuild a church (it just so happens that everyone along the way happens to have a few spare stones readily available). With a few followers we see Francis working with some crude structures at the church site and then, magically, we see Francis and his followers in an elaborate cathedral with large pillars and intricate stone work that would have taken sophisticated engineering to build. And Francis never encounters anything but beautiful sunny days.\n\nFrancis goes on a mission to the Holy Land and we see him wandering alone in the desert with a small pouch of water. Two Arabs are seen in this arid place who unleash vicious leopards upon Francis, but he tames them and gives them water. There is a &quot;my God is bigger than your God&quot; scene between Francis and the sultan that is quite depressing - how little progress we have make in 800 years.\n\nBradford Dillman does his best with the script he is given and has a couple of good scenes toward the end, but the acting by Dolores Hart and Stuart Whitman is pretty amateurish.\n\nThe main problem I have with this movie is that it did not show me what it was about this man that accounted for his accomplishments. He must have been inspiring and charismatic, but what we get here is a very passive reader of scripture. I understand the appeal of a Martin Luther King, but I do not understand the appeal of St. Francis from what I see in this movie.\n\nThe most enjoyable part of the movie for me were the photos of the Frescoes of Giotto in the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi that played under the opening credits.",

In both films the camera is set up right behind the Boer men when we then see the Gordon Highlanders charging them. Both films are pretty much the same in terms of story and action but it appears the second was filmed slightly to the left of the first film. You can tell this because of the houses in the background and how they move between the two films. Overall both films are a pretty good re-enactment and both manage to keep the action moving through their short running time. There are a couple mild goofs in the film but they&apos;re minor and to be expected for such early films."

      "reviewBody": "I learned about this movie 55 years ago from my girlfriend at that time and future wife in my native Czechoslovakia. She was working at the chemistry laboratory of Slovensky Film (Slovak Hollywood). As an employee she has had the access to movies before their distribution for general public. The communist party under the First Secretary Alexander Dubcek started reform movement which did not end well by Soviet and Warsaw Pact&apos;s invasion into the country that year. The movie director Leopold Lahola lived abroad but was rehabilitated and allowed to come back year before. He has died only 50 years old when the movie was still in the production.\n\nThe movie came nicely packed from Czechia. It has English subtitles and now I could see it with my current American wife during our weekly movie time. Czechoslovakia divided herself in 1993, but countries of Czechia and Slovakia still attain rich mutual relations. The movie in the country at that time still under the communist regime was considered to be a confession of a man who left his motherland, which opened her arms again for him to come back home. The environment and scenes are mostly from abroad and the movie is completely apolitical. After many years seeing it again, however, I offer you an alternative understanding and inspiration.\n\nOnly few people at that time in Czechoslovakia would think or talk about something like reincarnation, that was for Indians far away. Now when I have a lot of metaphysical studies behind me, I see the movie differently. The story of a man needing to sleep all winter in order to be able to live again advertised as a fantasy is there for many of us to think about a cyclical nature of our existence. Jonas Rebenda must always start as a child, then going through wild need to enjoy living until completely exhausted and tired he finally finds his Kalimagdora again. He is making the same mistakes again with only few adjustments and remembers only fragments from previous cycle of his life.\n\nDear traveler, you who are here, aren&apos;t we perhaps doing the same again and again? There are many people on this planet who seriously study the issue of a cyclical existence of independent soul and consciousness returning into the same environment. They want to improve and then master their understanding of a human nature. Jonas Rebenda sleeps in the small cabin on the mountain like many subjects do in lives between lives movement. How about many metaphysical travelers bringing information about independence of our soul from the other side? Are Kalimagdora and her mother representing loving and forgiving death when we completed another cycle of our existence? Is their tiny house representing hereafter? Are we returning to our true home after one life being like on a vacation or in a suffering, which became to be too long? We cannot ask Leopold Lahola, he is gone. But he gave as a chance to think about it.",

All the more remarkable for the fact that he also wrote and directed this at the age of 25 (Spielberg was 28 when he directed his first film). All the hallmarks of a Jackie Chan are there, though understandably not quite as polished as he later managed to achieve. The humour stands up well too, for its age. I did laugh out loud in a couple of places.",

      "reviewBody": "When future film critics decide to analyze the career of Michael J. Fox, they will likely say his talents were best suited to television, with an acknowledgement that he did star in the BACK TO THE FUTURE series. This will be a shame, as Fox has been an ingratiating, very enjoyable actor to watch, in most of his films, and DOC HOLLYWOOD is one of his best roles.\n\nAs breezy, fast-talking Washington, D.C. surgeon Dr. Ben Stone, who dreams of making big money doing plastic surgery in Hollywood, but finds his true calling as a general practitioner in a small southern hamlet, Fox is so &apos;right&apos; that you can&apos;t imagine any other actor in the role. After a minor traffic accident enroute to California forces him to do &apos;public service&apos; in fictional Grady, South Carolina, taking on much of the workload of a crusty old local physician (the always enjoyable Barnard Hughes), Stone becomes the &apos;talk&apos; of the town, and rustic but wise Mayor Nick Nicholson (David Ogden Stiers, in one of his most engaging performances), starts &apos;selling&apos; the joys of country life to the cosmopolitan young doctor. A quilt with &apos;magical&apos; powers provides a nude vision of the girl he&apos;s destined to love, &apos;Lou&apos; (Julie Warner), who turns out to be working at his office; his hormone-fueled pursuit of her, and her pragmatic &apos;indifference&apos; to his flirtations make their gradual romance edgy and fun to watch.\n\nIn a town full of colorful characters, two &apos;stars in the making&apos; stand out; Woody Harrelson, as &apos;Lou&apos;s&apos; suitor, Hank Gordon, a country variation of his bartending character from &apos;Cheers&apos;, talks dumb but has a knack for selling, only lacking a place to make big money at it; and Bridget Fonda, as Mayor Nicholson&apos;s oversexed but &apos;out of place&apos; daughter, hopes Stone will take her away to the bright lights of Hollywood. Both stars are terrific in their supporting roles, and show the charisma that would lead them to stardom.\n\nDOC HOLLYWOOD is full of charming vignettes, from Stone vicariously reading the mail for an illiterate farm couple, to being paid for services rendered with a rather large pig, who ultimately becomes his &apos;pet&apos;. The film abounds in warm comic touches that are guaranteed to bring a smile!\n\nWith a very funny cameo by George Hamilton, as the Hollywood plastic surgeon Stone dreams of working with, DOC HOLLYWOOD hits all the right notes for a terrific entertainment. My only complaint about the film is that it was actually filmed in Florida; as a South Carolina resident, I can attest that MANY of our small towns could have doubled quite nicely for Grady...\n\nDOC HOLLYWOOD is a film I&apos;m proud to have in my collection!",

As other reviewers have said, two fisherman come across a monster (&quot;Gorgo&quot;) off the coast of Ireland and decide to put it on display in London. Trouble begins when Gorgo&apos;s mother shows up and wants her child back! The scenes of terrified crowds rushing the streets and attacks by the military are all well filmed (obviously the British military helped out a great deal in producing the movie), and it&apos;s neat to see a monster destroy a city besides Tokyo for once. Gorgo is obviously someone in a rubber suit, but the monster itself comes across as totally believable. Takes a while to get moving, but well worth seeing."

      "reviewBody": "Carly Schroeder. I consider Lizzie McGuire to have some retrograde aspects, grit stemming from the blatant vengeance culture approach of Lizzie&apos;s family. It was a step towards me considering modern Disney to be highly suspicious, but a few years on and I have to find Disney&apos;s Lizzie McGuire, also Nickelodeon&apos;s Zoey 101, still to be head and shoulders better than most other television series for kids that I have on DVD. Carly occasionally appearing as &apos;Melanoma&apos;, a memorable and very beautiful but scary friend of Lizzie&apos;s scary little brother.\n\nThe past two years I have looked to see if Carly had anything else out on disk. I found Firewall, which did not appeal to me. Now I have obtained this.\n\nThis story shows that she can handle a very different role to Melina. Not that all who have commented on this would agree. In this her beauty is usually tamed down but she is trying to head in directions that often feel to be sensible. The people around her have different understandings of sensible. For me, this is the power of the story.\n\nThere is a lot of grit in this story as well. It is based on the 1970&apos;s and the males remind me of the males in such as Detroit Rock City, alien and really vomit level aggressive cavemen. The football field is not understood as a place with rules of good conduct, it is more a battlefield where the opposition are tough and players are tough even to players on their own team who they do not consider to rate good conduct. They are supposed to be tough, skilled but tough. This would never be a Dr Spock understanding of manly male? This is nothing like the bits of football or UK rugby league that I used to occasionally go to in the 1960&apos;s.\n\nIt reminds me of the world of battling &apos;heroes&apos; that I occasionally noticed in sports posters, local UK in the 1990&apos;s. An alien world. In the UK 1970&apos;s I did not notice the violence in people, it was there but more a hidden thing, silent and deadly.\n\nIn this, lead character Gracie is damaged by the violence, it knocks her down for more than half a year. She shows herself as having what it takes to gradually become a survivor. For me that is not the important part of the story, what counts more as this being a story that I can find okay on a second or third viewing. It is an okay way to pass the time.\n\nAdd the soundtrack including the sort of 1970&apos;s related music that I can rate as hot.\n\nThe bird is an American Kestral, aka American Sparrowhawk. A young male, not European but very common in the USA. The commentaries add detail. These are more real than one&apos;s average commentary."

      "name": "Kirk Knew What He Wanted",
      "reviewBody": "According to the Films of Kirk Douglas book, Douglas was offered a choice between a big budget MGM loan out The Great Sinner and this small independent film Champion about boxing. For the first time in his career Douglas was able to show what a shrewd judge of stories that were tailor made for him. \n\nHe chose Champion and for his efforts earned his first trip to the Oscar Sweepstakes. He lost the big prize to Broderick Crawford for All the Kings Men. But from then on in Kirk Douglas was taken seriously as an actor. Douglas was also determined to break free of studio contracts and chart his own career. Some actors can and some are terrible judges of screen property. Kirk Douglas has always been in the first category.\n\nThe story involved two brothers, Kirk Douglas and Arthur Kennedy, who when we first meet them are bumming their way across the country to take possession of a diner that was sold to them bogusly. To earn some eating money, Kirk had gone the distance in a four round preliminary fight and came to the attention of fight manager Paul Stewart. Now dead broke, Douglas turns to Stewart who takes him on as a prize fighter, for real.\n\nDouglas can&apos;t forget those days in the hobo jungle and is willing to do anything, use anybody to rise to the top of his profession. His role is a complex one, he&apos;s ruthless and tough, but he also has to have enough charm to fool the three women who enter his life, Ruth Roman, Marilyn Maxwell, and Lola Albright. \n\nArthur Kennedy got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actor category as Douglas&apos;s brother and conscience. Paul Stewart is every inch the wise professional fight manager who steps out of his league when Douglas gets into the big money in the fight game.\n\nThere&apos;s not a moviegoer who&apos;s ever seen Champion who will forget the primeval look on Kirk Douglas&apos;s face in the climatic fight scene in defense of his championship as he gets back up from the last of several knockdowns. Like something out of a Hammer horror picture, it&apos;s that frightening. You won&apos;t forget it either.",

Hill and Spencer function like Stan and Ollie, only more crudely - but that does not detract from their capacity to keep you interested in their shenanigans!\n\nSomewhat overlong and lacking the fabulous song theme of the original, TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME is good enough to deserve watching and rewatching a couple of times (at least!)",

I was excited &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos; is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-",

Still, writer/director Frank Tashlin keeps it breezy and fast-paced, and makes some memorable scenes, such as the wild chase at the end. Tashlin&apos;s previous work in animation is really evident here.\n\nWhat&apos;s unusual about this J.L. entry is that there are a number of quite serious moments, ranging from a criticism of for-profit medical care, and the saga of a suicidal patient Lewis&apos; character falls for. These moments are treated so serious (and convincingly) it&apos;s really odd to find them in such a slapstick movie."

Hardenberg, realistically played by Maximilian Schell.\n\nPrivate Ackerman (Montgomery Clift) a shy unassuming Jewish boy becomes a courageous soldier, opposing both enemy soldiers and the bigotry of their comrades.\n\nPrivate Withacre, a playboy who tries to avoid duty (Dean Martin), finally ends up resigning a safe post to join the fighting in Normandy, and becoming a soldier.\n\nThe usual Black and White shooting enhances the cruelty of WWII.

The story is very interesting, but the script lets it down. The film spans for a period of something like three decades (Monty&apos;s age was specified as almost 30 in the film), but the characters do not even age appropriately during this time. Some of the dialogues and the proceedings are overdone and some sequences are amateurishly done. Despite the flaws, Karz does have entertainment value, mainly due to the fantastic music and some successfully shot moments of suspense. Songs like &quot;Dard-E-Dil&quot;, &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; as well as the instrumental theme of the movie are beautiful. The entire reincarnation track could have been better done. Rishi Kapoor is Monty, a top singer who was named Ravi at his previous birth. Ravi was killed by his wife Kamini and eventually reborn as Monty, probably in order to take revenge. Kapoor did his part well, but at some points he overdid it. The vibrant Tina Munim played his love interest, and her overly childish attitude really got on my nerves. The show was stolen by the awesome Simi Garewal, and she played her elegant vicious Kamini with style. Karz is an okay film, quite watchable and enjoyable, but basically nothing particularly good.",

Meanwhile, Rosamund Kwan is a clerk at a big construction firm and dating Andy Lau. He doesn&apos;t know she is the daughter of the company&apos;s owner, working under a pseudonym to learn the business. However, her best friend Chingmy Yau does, and so does Waise Lee. To sabotage their romance, and to get his hands on Miss Kwan and the fortune, Lee hires Chow. Chow convinces Lau and his father, Jing Wong, that he is Wong&apos;s brother. Chow works at sabotaging Lau in the company.\n\nIt&apos;s all very funny, as Chow does a bunch of crazy stuff throughout. Miss Yau is a fit comedienne to go up against him, Wong is very funny in an evening gown, and Lau is the stalwart innocent. Full of the sort of gags that Western audiences know Chow for , his anything-for-a-gag shtick kept me smiling throughout.",

      "reviewBody": "When I was growing up in Poland  Wajda was always the most boring director for me, still remember when he made &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; my whole school went to cinema to see it, and it was so boring for all of us. Then I grow up a little, and found that my new favorite directors are Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Wells  and then they give Wajda a honorary Oscar for five decades of extraordinary film direction in 2000, and I started to wonder, why, then i watch &quot;Kanal&quot;, &quot;Popiol i diament&quot;, &quot;Czlowiek z marmuru&quot; and i knew it why  because he is powerful director. There were few weaker movies like &quot;Pokolenie&quot; or &quot;Lotna&quot; but majority of his movies are grand and timeless. I think &quot;Bez znieczulenia&quot; is one of the best movie by Wajda. Its story about man who got everything  fame, family, respect and love and in just one second his wife want divorce, and at work there is waiting for a man slow degradation. Its story showing communism in Poland from the worst side  a place where dabblers are winners, where when the suck starts it ends at Kafka notes. I was shocked how up to date the story is even now in democratic Poland. The screenplay is great  co-written with Agnieszka Holland i bet it shows a lot of real life situation, because the power on screen match perfectly the one scene when the lead character has his teeth pulled &quot;sin anestesia&quot;, and the whole movie is a much powerful, and painful as this one scene. There is great acting  especially by Zbigniew Zapasiewicz, but whole cast is just perfect from Seweryn and Dalkowska to the small creepy parts of Stuhr, Kaczor or Wilhelmi. Sadly this powerful movie is forgotten in Poland, but for me its the most important Polish movie, and so up-to-date that its almost scary. Must-See.",

      "name": "an interesting contribution to the Coen&apos;s ouvre",
      "reviewBody": "I found this to be a pretty interesting film by the Coens&apos;.  I was well aware of the ability to do noir, as evidenced by &apos;Blood Simple&apos;, as well as many-layered, dialogue-driven narratives as in &apos;Miller&apos;s Crossing.&apos;  But what I found intriging about this movie was that it was about inconsequence. Billy Bob Thornton&apos;s character, Ed Crane, is similar to William H. Macy&apos;s in &apos;Fargo.&apos;  Both have unsatisfying positions in lowly lives.  Both had received their jobs by &quot;marrying&quot; into them- Ed at the  Barber Shop, and William&apos;s at the car dealership.  The difference is, whereas the kidnapping plot is sought out in &quot;Fargo&quot;, the blackmailing plot falls into Ed&apos;s lap by sheer choice (luck? fate?)\n\n Ed&apos;s just a guy who wants to improve his lot in life- nothing too different then you or me.  His wife&apos;s affair simply gives him the opportunity to do so.  He didn&apos;t mind the infidelity, it is after all &quot; a free country.&quot;  But, of course, if she was faithful, there would be no noirish plot to pursue, correct?  Quiet ambition drives Ed.  After the dry-cleaning attempt goes sour, he sets his sights of Scarlett Johansenn&apos;s (who is quite remarkable) character&apos;s piano playing ability, in hopes of becoming her manager and &quot;making enough to get by.&quot;\n\n Thornton&apos;s &quot;Ed Crane&quot; really is the man who wasn&apos;t there.  He sits- nearly brooding- quietly, observing life laconically.  I actually found this movie quite sad.  In the end, the only one who cares about his story is a men&apos;s magazine.  And that&apos;s another big difference from &apos;Fargo&quot; in which the pregnant Frances McDormand curls up with her husband, and you feel as if everything is just right in the world.  That feeling is definitely lacking from &quot;The Man Who Wasn&apos;t There.&quot;\n\n Some viewers in the theater I saw it at said it was &quot;the funniest movie they&apos;ve seen all year.&quot;  Sadly, I think they&apos;re missing it.  Most of the humor is typical Coen&apos;s deadpan, but it is mostly generated from a tone of unease and tension.  It&apos;s clever, but you waon&apos;t be slapping your knees like in &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; or &quot;The Big Lewboski.&quot;\n\n Instead, you&apos;ll just be intrigued by the wonderful story that the Coens- who have become quite the master of their craft- have weaved in this beautifully textured, perfectly cast, and incredibly nuanced film."

I remember watching it when i was really little, five i think? Im not sure but i was young is the point...\n\nAnyways lets put the rose-colored glasses down and talk about the film a little. Clearly its a scooby doo film. Its the same basic plot as all the other films and TV shows... Then one has really good animation i must say...Its hand drawn just th way cartoons SHOULD be but sadly are not.\n\nOverall I still really like this movie and i have to give it an 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Here are the elements you need to make sense of this film: 1) the initial scene in which a French diplomat tells an anecdote about Yalta which reveals how the big powers &quot;cold-heartedly&quot; disposed of the lives of millions according to the logic of Realpolitik; 2) the character of Bleicher, whose brother fought on the side of the Germans in a French SS unit on the Russian front, was captured, and died in a POW camp in the USSR; Bleicher remains obsessed with retrieving the remains of his brother, while the French State shows little interest in the matter; 3) the characters representing the French Secret Service (Varins &amp; William Mahe&apos;), who were involved in a scheme to smuggle Soviet engineers out of the USSR only to sell them into a kind of techno-slavery to countries interested in their services; 4) the head of one such Soviet engineer who got into some hot water in Sumatra (by putting the head in Mathias&apos; suitcase, Bleicher wants Mathias to embarrass French intelligence). So what you get, in political terms, is a condemnation (rather oblique, admittedly) of big-power politics. So I suppose Desplechins would have been happier if, immediately at the conclusion of WWII, the US had declared war on the Soviet Union, dropped the atom bomb on Moscow, and &quot;liberated&quot; the peoples of Eastern Europe. If that&apos;s the director&apos;s idea of &quot;humanistic&quot; politics, I&apos;ll take Realpolitik any day. One distinctive note in this film: There&apos;s not one single character here who is &quot;sympa&quot;: not Mathias (too much of a wuss), not his Jewish classmate (captious); certainly not the villains in the French secret service; not Mathias&apos; sister (irritatingly capricious); not the son-of-diplomat diplomat (full of conceit); not even Emmanuelle Devos as Mathias&apos; would-be girlfriend (not worth the trouble wooing her--she fusses much too much).",

Like many biopics, there are too many events crammed into it, and little room is left for character development (characters pop up, have a few scenes and disappear). It will be disappointing if you expect a vision of a painter at work (like Clouzot&apos;s &quot;Mystère Picasso&quot;). However, the representation of the 17th Century Dutch society is both well-researched and a visual treat. The movie does a great job of being faithful to Rembrandt&apos;s vision, and is eventually much more moving and fascinating than the average &quot;tormented painter&quot; film."

      "reviewBody": "Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan&apos;s An Unreasonable Man insightfully and objectively chronicles the life of Ralph Nader and his interactions with society. It is filled with fascinating, carefully chosen, artfully constructed sequences which replay beautiful and dark moments of the past 60 plus years and puts them into context. Many of Nader&apos;s most ardent critics and supporters are interviewed in this balanced and educational documentary which focuses on facts and mixes them with speculation and opinion. I was riveted to the preview screening I saw on a large TV. Its so fast-paced, information packed, emotional, exciting, engaging, enRaging, and occasionally hilarious that when seeing it in a movie theater you should buckle your seatbelts! Keep your cell phones turned off and your mind open when watching this critically important film. It reminds me of 2 of my favorite Akira Kurosawa films, High and Low and Ikiru in the ways it makes me think about the pursuit of justice, equality, hard work, investigation, society, corporate ruthlessness, governmental bureaucracy, and the power of an individual to make a difference (for good or ill). An Unreasonable Man also reminds me of these 2 Kurosawa masterpieces because of its attention to detail, mastery of the subject, and mastery of the documentary format. It gives you powerfully organized information in chronological order and copious amounts of vintage footage which has been fascinatingly and cleverly edited and lets you make up your mind about this powerful, fascinating, multi-faceted, and controversial subject, Ralph Nader.",

And when it released it some how managed to survive the monsoon. May be because Simbu&apos;s so called romantic thriller chased people away to this one or there was something about the movie which made you want to see it. Anyway this is Ajith&apos;s best performance in years. he makes you forget the many poor aspects of the movie.The songs grow on you. I think the sentiment scenes worked really well with the audience. both the heroines have decent screen time. there are probably a few unwanted jokes placed in the movie. And yes i do not know what the title was all about ? but i give it 10 because i have never seen a movie single handedly saved by an actor."

But sunny boy prefers party, and delivering happy pills for shady guys. When daddy finds out, He takes him back to the village, locks him up in the dogs cage, gives him a &quot;doctor novel&quot; to read: &quot;When you know this out of memory, you can go&quot;.\n\nThe movie mixes lots of genres, a little bit of Comedy, Farce, Thriller, and social study. Enough to carry on the movie, but not enough to satisfy. regularly it builds up expectations only to tell you &quot;gotcha!&quot; - but very weak and unenthusiastic. Might be it&apos;s trying to break conventions - but only a little bit.\n\nNonetheless, it is charming, the actors (again: somewhat stereotype, somewhat &quot;interesting&quot;) are convincing in what they do, and both daddy and sunny boys little &quot;pearl&quot; are a joy to watch. Nice, but not necessary."

      "reviewBody": "To actually see a movie from Pakistan in which actors are talking and not yelling was a pleasant surprise but as the movie progressed it completely blew my mind off for being so real. This movie take its viewer right in to the world of Pakistanis who are either living in Pakistan or residing abroad especially in western world. It realistically portrays life in Pakistan where people are caught between the hardliner religious scholars and carrying the normal activities and pleasures in life. It also shows the dilemma of overseas Pakistanis when they see their children being brought up in a western society. Finally, it painfully shows what has happened to many Pakistanis that have been targeted by western people and law after 9/11. The greatest service that this movie has done is to show the world that how difficult it is right now to be Pakistani and I can&apos;t say much more than that.\n\nOn the side of acting all the actors did justice to their characters. Shaan (Mansoor) was at his best and I must admit that I never thought that Shaan could deliver such a powerful performance after seeing his mindless Punjabi movies. His acting, while being tortured by law was realistic to a frightening extent. After watching the movie I felt that huge amount of research must have gone on the background as every situation looked near to reality. For example, the way Government Political Agent approached tribal council was very realistic.\n\nAmidst all the painful realities the film does give a ray of hope in the end when Iman Ali (Maryam/Marry) opens a girl&apos;s school in tribal area. I guess it was necessary for the artist (Shoaib Mansoor-director) to give hope in the end. Although, sadly speaking that ray of hope is still no way near in sight to Pakistani society as during the last few years, many of the girls schools in northern area of Pakistan have either been bombed or closed down as a result of threats and I am afraid that Maryam school might have been one of them.",

      "reviewBody": "Be it as it may be, I think I&apos;ve grown into being a Shinya Tsukamoto fan-boy over the years. I simply haven&apos;t seen one bad film by the man yet. And fans of Asian cinema will most likely concur with me on this. While his older, more outrageous films are just as shocking as they are fun, his later work developed into more thought-provoking, equally disturbing at times, fantastic cinema. You don&apos;t even have to like his films, but the least anyone can say is that they are intriguing and interesting.\n\nIn 2008 Tsukamoto presented us with NIGHTMARE DETECTIVE (aka AKUMU TANTEI), introducing an unlikely hero in the form of Kyoichi Kagenuma (Ryuhei Matsuda), a troubled young man who has the ability of entering other people&apos;s dreams, or in this case nightmares. While the first NIGHTMARE DETECTIVE was a solid supernatural serial killer/slasher entry, this sequel is injected with a completely new storyline, resulting on the one hand in a slightly gentler film and on the other: An even more discomforting picture on a psychological level.\n\nRyuhei Matsuda reprises his role as the Nightmare Detective, but this time his character feels much more tormented. While filling his days with trying to understand personal demons from the past and contemplating thoughts of suicide to end this dubious ability he has been gifted with, his life will take another meaningful turn when he is contacted by Yukie. She and her friends once played a cruel joke on a fellow student, Kikukawa, and now she is plagued by horrible nightmares in which her friends die one by one. When her friends start dying of unnatural causes in real life, Yukie fears she&apos;ll be next.\n\nIn my opinion, NIGHTMARE DETECTIVE 2 surpasses it&apos;s predecessor on almost all levels. For one thing, though the film has a slightly more poetic feel to it (as opposed to the dark and chaotic nature of the original), it&apos;s laden with depression and grief, adding a foreboding atmosphere that grows stronger as the film progresses. While the first film had a more straightforward plot (albeit still following Tsukamoto&apos;s puzzling logic at times), now the story features a well-balanced duality. When Kyoichi starts to learn more about the origin of Yukie&apos;s nightmares, he discovers parallels with his own past which will eventually lead to more discoveries concerning the mystery of his own, cursed persona.\n\nAMUKU TANTEI 2 is all about unexplainable things that inflict sheer terror on human beings and how they leave victims psychologically devastated. It is as much a true horror film as it is a psychological drama. Rest assured, certain scenes do get scary at times, though expect a bit more subtlety this time. Don&apos;t expect things clearly spelled out for you either, but more a visual language that explains things to a satisfying degree. Through Kyoichi&apos;s character Tsukamoto successfully tries to define the nature of terror – or at least providing one specific insight to it for Kyoichi – and it surprisingly results in a film that&apos;s far more sophisticated than anyone could expect from a sequel.\n\nNIGHTMARE DETECTIVE 2 can actually be viewed as a stand alone film (due to the new storyline), however, watching the original first is always advisable (if only it was to better understand the weight of Matsuda&apos;s character). And for once I&apos;d love to see another sequel made (only with Shinya Tsukamoto at the helm, of course). Kyoichi Kagenuma is by far one of the most original and intriguing anti-hero characters I&apos;ve seen coming out of Asian cinema over the last few years. The possibilities of developing his character seem limitless, and with this second film being very different in tone, I&apos;m most interested in seeing what a third film would bring us. Maybe a Nightmare Detective Trilogy would be a nice way to wrap things up?\n\n(from the Cult Reviews vault, with kind permission)",

      "reviewBody": "Let me establish a few things at the start: 1) I love disco, soul, and R&amp;B, 2) I love the &apos;70s, 3) I love bad movies, 4) I have a healthy admiration for Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, as well as many of the other luminaries in this film. All that said, this film is APPALLING IN EVERY RESPECT!\n\nI knew this movie was poorly regarded, and I expected to like it anyway (I&apos;m certainly not sorry I&apos;ve seen it) but the ratio of potential to realization is like 100:1. I&apos;m really surprised it has so many defenders on this site. Let&apos;s discuss:\n\nYes, many people have said that Diana Ross is too old. What&apos;s not mentioned is that she looks TERRIBLE! She looks like a refugee! Also, she just has the wrong voice for this part. Stephanie Mills had a strange, nasal voice, but she was a BELTER, and you need a belter for these songs. Poor Diana and her thin voice just couldn&apos;t cut it, and she had no physical charm to fall back on. Oh dear.\n\nI was really surprised how lame the musical renditions and sound quality were. I have surround sound, and I just couldn&apos;t believe how muffled and distant the sound was. And, in my opinion, ALL of the musical performances were misfires. You could see how many of the songs could have been good in a good performance, but those just weren&apos;t to be found here.\n\nMany people single out Lena Horne&apos;s performance as fantastic, but to me, like the rest of the movie, she was BADLY misused. Lena Horne is a nuanced jazz singer, so to hear her try to go all low-down gospel was rather painful, especially with her impeccably-enunciated &quot;Woo! Yeah!&quot;&apos;s. She also looks utterly ridiculous. \n\nI didn&apos;t get much of a sense of the old Michael Jackson we all used to love between the layers of makeup and the lack of focus of the movie and scenes.\n\nI love how Dorothy alternates between being worried that Toto is out of her sight for even a moment because he is so precious to her, and completely forgetting about his existence for long periods of time.\n\nAlso, apparently the scarecrow&apos;s owner shredded the works of the great philosophers (or at least his copy of Bartlett&apos;s Famous Quotations) to stuff his scarecrow with?\n\nAnd WHAT is happening in the sequence where the subway comes to life and attacks our heroes? WHAT is that? Also, the cowardly lion doesn&apos;t get much of a character arc, does he? One scene he&apos;s going on about how he doesn&apos;t have any courage, the next he&apos;s ferociously defending Michael against the saber-toothed garbage cans.\n\nNow think about that: saber-toothed garbage cans. Hmmm.\n\nI understand that during this movie our quartet go through tableaux of the issues affecting blacks in the 70&apos;s, fine... so then what&apos;s with the emerald city scene where the Wiz dictates fashion to the people below? Am I to understand that one of the major cultural issues African-Americans faced in the 70&apos;s was the tyranny of imperious fashion designers?\n\nI was surprised that of all the things they kept from the original Wizard of Oz film, they jettisoned the device that Dorothy is just dreaming about all the people she knows, and at the end there&apos;s no &quot;And you were there, and you were there, and you were there&quot; scene. \n\nI was kind of stupefied by how HUGE some of the sets were. Many looked like actual NYC locations that they has just laid a yellow-brick floor on. I would love to know if they actually did that, or just built these enormous sets.\n\nWell, that&apos;s it! This film is not a total waste of 2 hours, but it is... quite an oddity.\n\n--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies at: www.cinemademerde.com"

Kim Ha Neul is okay quite up to the action and changes of costume. Kang Ji Hwan is likeable enough as the bumbling rookie agent and he has the best comedic sequences. For a 2009 movie I guess it&apos;s okay but in 2020 it doesn&apos;t quite stand the test of time. This is not one of those Korean movies that is better than Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just finished watching this... it&apos;s in my VLC player for two days. The main reason why it took me so long to go through it is that I find things that I love about it, and on the other hand I find things that I can&apos;t believe are so very poor and almost make vomit... and so this dichotomy makes the movie a hard piece to swallow.\n\nI&apos;ll try to name a few of the negative aspects first: \n\n1. The plot line seems confused and overly complex, and the poor graphic details of the movie make it pale and uninteresting to look at (which, if it where not the case, could help create interest on the viewer&apos;s part to keep pace with the strange and intricate family drama) \n\n2. There are hardly any other actors apart from the characters; this means there are little to no extras, no population, no sense of society... all it looks like is a void and empty sequence of dark scenarios with little to no discerning features whatsoever... Making the whole thing a little too often look like a sequence of amateur theater shoots. In other words, the director and producers did not bother to put any effort into making the environment of the film credible. It isn&apos;t at any time delivering any kind of veracity to the possibility of the story ever finding an imaginable realm where it could take place.\n\n3. Things don&apos;t seem too thought out. The main character is a prince, or some kind of bastard descendant of a ruler... but he does not behave like one. You can hardly piece together how he lived his life, why he is hunted down (right at the beginning), or why is his brother convinced that he is somehow responsible for his father&apos;s death. I mean... it doesn&apos;t feel like a noble family&apos;s intuitive dynamic at all, certainly not like the type on a Dostoievsky novel.\n\n4. It looks like it&apos;s a student project, because the acting is so over the top, on a few of the parts... Other, elder, actors are brilliant. The difference is astounding. There seems to be no effort to push the younger actors into delivering a real credible performance. It feels very strange.\n\nOK, on to the good parts:\n\n1. The dialogs. They really present a vocabulary experience that is close to film noir classics, and and times is so poetic and powerful that it actually makes you think of Russian novels. It seems to be very well written throughout, but poorly executed. I almost need to close my eyes to the sad spectacle of the movie, to listen to the character&apos;s amazing discourse on some parts. The main character is poorly crafted, I thought... It lacked coherence in it&apos;s actions, some real sense of integrity, I feel the way it is both shown and interpreted is very silly, exaggerated and completely nonsensical.\n\n2. Some of the acting is amazing, Tony Amendola especially! I rarely see such talent in an actor... he was the only one (maybe alongside Patrick Bachau) that picked up the text and brought it to a credible output... and he stands out brilliantly.\n\n3. The fighting. Well, I thought fights here would be ridiculous... in the context of the dramatic feud that takes place through the plot. But in the end, they are quite contrary, almost the best this film has to show. They seem well rehearsed, well executed and choreographed, and look pretty cool. Too bad the scenarios in which they take place are so lame, and incoherent... Where it not for that, the fight scenes would be some of the most consistent I&apos;ve seen.\n\n4. The sense of sympathy. The core idea of this film seems to be so appealing, I can almost imagine this script beating the crap out of a Frank Miller adaptation of Sin City. I can compare this title to &quot;The Spirit&quot;... &quot;The Spirit&quot; has a million dollar budget, looks brilliant, but it&apos;s absolutely horrible (week and whack storyline, terrible acting, horrendously tedious and terrible directing), but &quot;The Perfect Sleep&quot; - if it had better and more consistent casting and directing - and the visual investments of &quot;The Spirit&quot; could have been a fabulous work of art. It feels like something that should be re-done by some serious experts, because I believe there would be much better ways of delivering the script.\n\nIn the end, it&apos;s hardly worth watching unless you don&apos;t have anything better to do. I hope this helped... My vote of 5 goes to the writers and the initial concept that could have been brilliantly executed, to the idea that could have been... And an incentive to Pardoe, who imagined it, to learn from this experience and do better next time.",

      "reviewBody": "Man of Tai Chi may not be one of the best martial arts movie made, but i would say, its a good first attempt at directing by one of my more favored actor and an all-around good human being, Keannu Reeves. Though the acting might slightly be bland for the most part (all right then, all through out except for Karen Mok who i adore), but then again you have to admit though it&apos;s not exactly Shakespeare we&apos;re watching here. Its a pound for pound martial arts movie for action flick aficionados, too much acting or show of emotions would&apos;ve made it too soft for me or pretentious. I think this movie might as well be Mr. Reeves&apos; love letter to Chinese cinema which apparently influenced him a lot. I&apos;m quite impressed as well that Mr. Reeves has set his Hollywood superstar status aside to make way for the little guy behind all the fancy stunts and high kicks that makes all those Hollywood action movies enjoyable. Kudos to Tiger Chen for the amazing action sequences in this film as well in the other movies he had been in as stunt coordinator and the like. Mr. Chen, is the real thing here. And in conclusion, i would like to say that i know that not all may come to appreciate this movie, only a few will, but i say its an acquired taste. Its entertaining for the most part. I&apos;m glad its not deep which is what i like in an action flick, because i don&apos;t want to work that hard when i&apos;m already too exhausted just following the punches thrown in this film. But its a joyride and a spectacle to savor from beginning to end. Again, congratulations Mr. Anderson... the Matrix will be proud.",

      "reviewBody": "Some great roles for woman were written in the end of the last century such as Thelma And Louise, Steel Magnolias, Fried Green Tomatoes, Moonstruck, and this one, slightly overlooked in that stellar company. Used People tells a wonderful tale of a widow and grandmother played by Shirley MacLaine to whom a second love comes right at the funeral of her husband.\n\nAs this Jewish family is sitting Shiva for MacLaine&apos;s husband, Marcello Mastroianni comes in, unknown and imparts a secret to MacLaine concerning her late husband.\n\nMastroianni intrigues her, but MacLaine&apos;s most Jewish of families is against the very idea of her keeping company with him.\n\nThere are a host of wonderful roles besides the leads and it&apos;s the mark of a great film that these characters are invested with individuality by the writers. Some great players bring said individuality to those parts.\n\nMacLaine&apos;s two daughters, Marcia Gay Harden and Kathy Bates are as different as can be. Harden is constantly acting out with different Hollywood legends portrayed. She&apos;s a real drama queen, years later still in mourning for a child she lost. She has a great scene with her other young son Michael Branton who also been acting out some dangerous things.\n\nKathy Bates was the less favored daughter with a weight problem who lets MacLaine have it. Bates is sick of the indulgence given Hardenand who could blame her.\n\nTwo aged actresses from earlier days, Sylvia Sidney and Jessica Tandy have some wonderful scenes as a pair of old Jewish yentas. They quarrel but there&apos;s a bond there.\n\nAn old tune that Frank Sinatra recorded with Tommy Dorsey, The Sky Fell Down provides a great musical theme for November/November romance.\n\nUsed People is a great ensemble film and should get a lot more attention than it has gotten.",

      "reviewBody": "River Phoenix co-stars in this political thriller as &quot;Jeff Grant&quot;, an All-American teenager determined to enrol in the Air Force Academy to impress his parents. What he&apos;s never known is that his dad and mom (Richard Jenkins, Caroline Kava) are in reality Soviet &quot;sleeper&quot; agents that have long been residents of the U.S. of A. FBI agent Roy Parmenter (Sidney Poitier) finds this out, and goes out of his way to befriend Jeff, hoping to expose the parents. But while this is going on, a renegade Soviet agent, &quot;Scuba&quot; (Richard Lynch), is busy eliminating sleepers in hopes of a payoff. The KGB sends one of their top men, Konstantin Karpov (Richard Bradford), to apprehend Scuba.\n\n&quot;Little Nikita&quot; is directed competently enough by actor / filmmaker Richard Benjamin (&quot;My Favourite Year&quot;), but it&apos;s almost defeated by an utterly lousy script, credited to John Hill and Bo Goldman. It has barely a believable moment, but, to be fair, the incredible absurdity of the dialogue and scenes is good for some laughs. Poitier does give the movie some life with a lively and jokey performance; he&apos;s amusing, helping to smooth over a lot of those rough spots. Phoenix is good as the kid who&apos;s confronted with this truth about his folks that seems impossible to swallow. In fact, it&apos;s this excellent cast (also including Jerry Hardin as Poitiers&apos; superior, Loretta Devine as a guidance counsellor who gets into bed with Poitier, and a briefly seen Lucy Deakins as Jeffs&apos; girlfriend) that makes this preposterous movie as entertaining as it is. It really goes off the rails towards the end, with a priceless climax that turns the parents into action heroes! This is followed by more nonsense - a standoff on a trolley, a denouement on a border crossing.\n\nSomewhat fun on a no-brainer level, but Phoenix&apos;s next picture, &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, about another average American kid forced to deal with an unpleasant reality about his folks, is superior.\n\nSix out of 10.",

So I was a little apprehensive about this, the third and final film in the trilogy, but in the end I wasn&apos;t disappointed. Petter Næss, who directed the first film, but not Mors Elling, was back in the director&apos;s chair, and I think it shows.\n\nOverall, Elsk meg i morgen (Love Me Tomorrow) is a little darker and more sombre than its predecessor, but it has a lot of subtlety and emotional weight. The acting is superb, and I would definitely recommend you watch this film if you get the opportunity. (Although you&apos;ll probably have to try to get hold of the Norwegian DVD release, which does have English subtitles.) I would though recommend that you watch the original Elling film first, as Elsk meg i morgen kind of assumes you know the main characters already. You don&apos;t need to watch Mors Elling to appreciate either of the later films though, it just provides more background.",

      "reviewBody": "In recent times, I guess we&apos;re all too familiar with the bad press that North Korea is getting, especially in its nuclear weapons programme. One of the last hardlined communist states left in the world, we often wonder what goes on behind that iron curtain, in its reclusive behaviour that have spawned many questions with little forthcoming answers. And documentaries which offer a sneak peek into what goes on behind that veil of secrecy, would also be cast a doubtful eye whether the filmmakers were gagged from painting a more subjective angle.\n\nNaturally, getting permission to shoot within North Korea isn&apos;t easy, and Daniel Gordon and his crew spent more than 3 years obtaining that nod, and for the fact that they were allowed unprecedented bandwidth to capture what they needed for their movie (and I guess the good job they did with this, opened another door for their other North Korean documentary titled A State of Mind). For those interested in the landscape of the state beyond the much publicized mass displays and sabre-rattling military parades, this film offers a wonderful montage of life in the country, with plenty of everyday scenes fused into one sequence that was, in my opinion, too short, as it left you wanting more.\n\nBut let&apos;s get back to the subject matter, and that&apos;s the exploration of what happened to the North Korean football team of 1966, who were very much written off by pundits all over despite their hard work at overcoming Australia in the qualifiers, which stemmed very much from a history left unlearned, just like how the Western forces underestimated the drive and will to win of the Imperial Japanese forces in WWII. The filmmakers had tracked down almost all the surviving members of that team of 66, and one just cannot believe that they&apos;re hardly the straight-laced, serious folks that one would expect anyone to become after living under a hard regime all their lives.\n\nThe film straddles between the present and the past, allowing each man to recount their moment of glory on a world stage. Everyone had a sense of humour, and this shows during their interviews, being extremely free with their words and candid in their responses, quite contrary to what one would expect, with minders probably being close by nodding in approval at what was mentioned, but it&apos;s not the case. In many ways, Dan Gordon&apos;s film will open up many eyes, that politics aside, they too are human beings with the same hopes and dreams, with experience to share, and the desire to do so with fellow friends, no matter what political system they live under. And you can&apos;t help but to chuckle at how confused these guys were when they finally made that leap into democracies during their tour of duty, which on one hand they&apos;re pretty focused on their mission, and on the other in awe at the frenzy happening around them.\n\nThis film can also be deemed as a football film in a certain sense, since it had archived a slice of qualifying action for that sole Oceania-Africa-Asian spot in the World Cup finals of 16 teams then. The 1966 World Cup will always be remembered for a few things, and for football fans, this film presents and showcases some of those aspects, in a year where England hoisted its only World Cup trophy to date, and on home soil too. For those who are familiar with footballing legends, then this film offered us a glimpse of the 1965 minted European footballer of the year, and top scorer of the tournament in Portugal&apos;s Eusebio. You&apos;ll also bear witness to how the rules of the sport had evolved, as back then substitutes were not allowed.\n\nBut like most sports too, there&apos;s always this deep affinity with the underdogs, and the North Korean team, being the representative of Oceania, Africa and Asia, had its work cut out for them. And probably their success in making up for their lack of technical skills with fitness, speed and energy to chase down every ball, though lacking accuracy up front to make it count for something. Their &quot;Chollima&quot; mindset and swelling of pride not to let their fatherland down, that never-say-die attitude, could have also endeared the team to many fans in Britain, especially the Middlesbrough folks who have adopted the team as their own. And the never-ending debate on teamwork versus individual flair cannot be more keenly defined when witnessing how through teamwork the North Koreans have overcome opponents, though thanks to the Portuguese&apos;s Eusebio he had single handedly, through conscious body-language., turned the tide in a riveting match that the filmmakers had managed to condense into a tense finish.\n\nThe film also tries to insert statements whenever it can on how the role of sports can be used to promote harmony and goodwill, in building bridges and strengthening ties, and cutting through politics and the sore memories of war, between those who were fighting on opposite sides a decade ago. But I guess the true value here is that peek behind the iron curtain, and for footballing fans, an extremely well made documentary that brings a blast from the past in one of the World Cup&apos;s defining moments.",

      "reviewBody": "A lot has already been said about this compelling, oft-overlooked film, virtually all of which hits the proverbial nail on the head. While Eric Braeden delivers a superb, understated performance as Dr. Charles Forbin, the fact is that the real star of the film is the vast, omnipotent machine he has created. Even before it begins to speak with the chilling Cylonesque voice it has ordered designed for itself (the great Paul Frees like you&apos;ve never heard him before), you&apos;ll find yourself glued to the screen watching Colossus &quot;talk&quot; to its supposed masters over its huge monitors.\n\nA word about Frees&apos; contribution to the film: In &quot;War Games,&quot; for example, the computer has a curious sort of empathetic communication style (&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you rather play a nice game of chess?&quot;) presented in a voice that sounds like E.T. filtered through a synthesizer. Frees gives Colossus an emotionless yet fearful quality of speech that seems to belie its implacable drive to dominate human destiny.\n\nMy favorite part of this film has always been, and will always be, the climactic monologue Colossus announces to the listening masses of humanity. From its opening line -- &quot;This is the voice of world control,&quot; an identity neither Colossus nor its counterpart, Guardian, had used to that point -- you know this isn&apos;t going to be a happy speech if you are a sentient, flesh &amp; blood resident of the Earth. What is particularly creepy about the speech is that, for all of its strangely optimistic sermonizing about how &quot;the human millennium will be fact&quot; and how the computer will set about the task of &quot;solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man&quot; -- outwardly the Utopian dream -- the message Colossus is presenting is set against the dreadful backdrop of &quot;disobey (me) and die.&quot; As Colossus intones, &quot;You say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride.&quot; In the end, unlike other supercomputer-run-amok films such as &quot;War Games&quot; or &quot;Tron,&quot; &quot;Colossus&quot; is an end-of-the-world story without the nuclear or viral holocaust. In this film, it is the human spirit that is the casualty while the human biology lingers on. Unlike the rest of the doomsday genre, our end comes not so much with a bang as it does with a whimper.",

Music and dance are their passion and their path to happiness are hampered by handicap, society and family. \n\nBeing blind and what it entails is explored, but the film falls rarely into cliché. It rings true, it is simple and has two very likable, real and relatable characters.\n\nThe film, editing, acting, directing (and yes music!) are great but never try to be grandiose. Always humble or the right note to employ the music metaphor, this film finds truth, hope and beauty. Even the friendship romance is just right, not forced, cute and light.\n\nSee it if you can. At least you can, because blind piano prodigy Huang Yu-Siang who plays himself and compose some of the soundtrack sure wish he had vision. Perhaps he and first feature film director Jung-chi Chang do have vision: artistic vision.",

I even made several attempts to locate/purchase the soundtrack. To this day, I still sing their version of &apos;Iko Iko&apos;. I had no clue who Julia Roberts was at this time - but her character did stick with me. This movie is fun to go back and watch now, with all of its cast who have gone on to further their careers.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Monster&quot; (aka &quot;Gwai muk&quot; or &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;) is not your average Hong Kong horror movie, and there is no woman in a white dress running around with her face covered by hair. And while it is labeled as horror, the movie is not really scary, whereas it is more disturbing and psychologically chilling.\n\nThe story is about a family moving into a new apartment, but there is something sinister lurking in the maze-like ventilation shafts of the apartment complex, and the young boy in the family becomes the center of unwanted attention. When he is abducted, the family bonds are pushed to the limits. And with a tragic past such as the one lurking in the ventilation shafts, it quickly becomes a race of life and death.\n\nStory-wise, then &quot;The Monster&quot; is adequate, but nothing overly memorable. But what makes the movie great is the extraordinary performances put on by Shu Qi (playing the mother) and Karena Lam (playing &apos;the monster&apos;). I am not overly familiar with the Work of Karena Lam, despite having watched Hong Kong movies for close to 25-30 years already. She really put on an amazing performance as a crazy woman.\n\nThere are no super spectacular CGI effects in the movie, but it doesn&apos;t need such to be interesting. The make-up on Karena Lam was quite good and served its purpose quite well.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t already seen Cheang Poi Soi&apos;s movie &quot;The Monster&quot;, then you should take the time to do so.\n\nI will say that the movie&apos;s DVD cover really doesn&apos;t do the movie any justice at all.",

      "reviewBody": "A continental dream team of Marlene Dietrich and Vittorio DeSica team up for Montecarlo a place that was big news in 1957 because of a wedding that took place there. It was a natural that someone would have done some kind of Monaco based story because of the wedding of their reigning Prince Rainer to American film star Grace Kelly.\n\nThere was however little chemistry between Dietrich and DeSica. I think both of them did the film because of the opportunity to spend time on the Riviera. That&apos;s as good a reason as any I&apos;ve ever heard.\n\nThe two stars are a pair of fortune hunters. Both have lost heavily at the gaming tables and each spies the other as a possible mark. When the horrible truth sinks in that they&apos;ve only combined their debts they decide to team up and get richer respective partners. They decide on a father and daughter duo of millionaires.\n\nHighlight of the film is Marlene Dietrich trying to seduce her mark Arthur O&apos;Connell with a vamp version of Back Home In Indiana. Bet you never thought of that as a torch song. But when Marlene does it in her inimitable style it has possibilities.\n\nBut what I can&apos;t figure out is why DeSica was given 18 year old Natalie Trundy to go after. I mean the writers couldn&apos;t have had him trying to work O&apos;Connell&apos;s sister instead of a daughter? He really comes across as a dirty old man. It&apos;s the main weakness of the film.\n\nAmong the supporting players is Italian comedian Renato Rascel who would co-star with Mario Lanza in The Seven Hills Of Rome the following year. He plays a pawnbroker who wants his tickets redeemed or Marlene&apos;s jewelry. Seems as though she had an agreement with Rascel&apos;s brother to allow her to wear the jewels for the casinos. Rascel wants an end to that practice and he and Dietrich have some great scenes together.\n\nThe wide screen color cinematography of Monaco and the Riviera are absolutely breathtaking. I&apos;m glad color was used for this beautiful spot on the planet.\n\nAccording to a recent biography of Marlene Dietrich, Vittorio DeSica had two great passions, pursuit of young girls in real life like Natalie Trundy and the gaming tables. He was a candidate for Gamblers Anonymous, DeSica when he won financed his films that way. Many a day&apos;s shoot was held up because of DeSica&apos;s late night hobbies.\n\nStill Dietrich&apos;s legion of fans world wide will like the film and enjoy a glimpse of Montecarlo at the beginning of the Princess Grace story.",

The Vietnamese found out that in contrast to the data Soviet provided, the Chinese weaponry of Soviet origin worked much better than they should, such as less maintenance and long operational hours, so Soviet spies tried to obtain the battery once it was found out the longer operation hour and reduced maintenance was due to the new battery.  (Original Soviet battery malfunctioned frequently, causing the systems that incorporate such batteries to fail frequently.)\n\nThe film crew did a poor job in switching the chemical components of the battery in real life into the atomic/radioactive components to be more dramatic, as well as making up some foolish claim of the thing can be use a weapon instead of power source, but such alteration of real life was not done well, and the movie should stick with the original story like Dong Fangjin or Lan Jing Jin Ji Chu Dong did, because  accurate depiction of the failed former-Soviet spy attempt in those movie did well in box office, there was no need to make something more dramatic by faking it, especially when it can not be faked well."

      "reviewBody": "When it set off to sea, the Bismarck was among the most powerful battleships in the world. Very modern and very tough--it&apos;s hard to imagine that its entire service life was only a couple weeks! This story tells about this voyage as well as the mission by Robert Ballard (who gained fame by discovering the resting place of the Titanic) and his crew to locate and then document the Bismarck. The first attempt came up empty but the second found this massive ship--something that sounds MUCH easier than it actually is considering how deep the ship lies as well as how big the ocean is. All in all, an interesting show and seeing the footage of the ship on the bottom alone is reason to watch this one.\n\nIf you do wish to see this, it is currently available streaming through Netflix.",

      "reviewBody": "The problem with &quot;The Weight of the Water&quot;, the film, is the way the novel by Anita Shreve, was adapted for the screen. This is the basic flaw that even a good director like Kathryn Bigelow couldn&apos;t overcome when she took command of the production. The novel, as it is, presents grave problems for a screen treatment, something that the adapters, Alicia Arlen and Christopher Kyle, were not successful with their screen play.\n\nThe picture is basically a film within a film. Both subjects, the present time and the story that is revealed as Jane gets involved, parallel each other, but one story has nothing to do with the other. Also, the way this film was marketed was wrong. This is not a thriller at all. What the book and the film are about is human situations that are put to a test.\n\nIn the story that happened many years ago in a settlement in coastal New England, there was a notorious murder at the center of the narrative. It has to do with a wrongly accused man, Louis Wagner, a man that is basically crippled with arthritis that is accused by Maren Hontvelt, his landlady, as the one that killed two women, Karen and Anethe. In flashbacks we get to know the truth of how an innocent man is hung for a crime he didn&apos;t commit.\n\nThe second story shows how Jane who is traveling with her husband Thomas, in his brother&apos;s yacht. She is a photographer on assignment about the place where the women were murdered, years ago, is lured to the subject matter she is photographing, and makes the discovery of the truth. Her own relationship with her husband Thomas is a troubled one. They are doomed as a couple, one can only see the way he leers after his brother&apos;s girlfriend as she parades almost naked in the pleasure boat they are spending time. In the novel the tension comes across much deeply than what one sees in the movie.\n\nThe amusing thing about the film is that the secondary story is more interesting than the present one. Thus, the luminous Sarah Polley, who plays Maren in the secondary tale, makes a deep impression, as does the accused man, Louis Wagner, who is portrayed by Ciaran Hands. Sean Penn, comes across as somehow stiff as Thomas. The wonderful Katrin Cartlidge is totally wasted.\n\nThe film has elicited bad comments in this forum, but it&apos;s not the bad movie some people are trying to say it is. Better yet, read Ms. Shreve&apos;s novel as it is more satisfying than what came out in this movie version.",

Secondly, it brings together all the great talents in Austrian film at the time. But thirdly and most importantly, it is state - commissioned, and it shows. Badly. Intended as a propaganda piece, this film loses no time in using the kitschiest possible imagery (and music!) to convince the viewer. The framing story is ridiculously badly written and deeply misogynist to boot - the Union&apos;s strong - willed President is even asked if she &quot;really is a woman&quot;! The historical reenactments meant to demonstrate to the delegates - and the viewer - how peaceful Austria is, are elaborate and well - made (the costumes are gorgeous), but extremely obvious propaganda. Yet still, this piece has its own quirky, kitschy charm. In a naive way, it is very honest - it makes no effort at all to hide that its first and only intention is to make a point. It is unabashedly political, and it uses all the clichés of early fifties comedy to reach its goal. Recommended to anyone interested in Austria&apos;s postwar history, as it shows the atmosphere in occupied Austria very well - how anxious everyone was to gain independence and yet how improbable it seemed that it would be granted anytime soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Twenty years after `La cage aux folles&apos;, `Pédale douce&apos; revisits the comedy that has gay characters as main comic devices. Obviously, times have changed, and while the Cage&apos;s heroes were hysterical, outrageous `queens&apos;, gays in a 1996 comedy need to be more realistic. Here, Adrien and his friends are gay top bank executives who have to deal with Alexandre, a powerful, über-macho client. Because he&apos;s in love with Eva, Adrian&apos;s best female friend and gay club owner, Alexandre will discover a world he&apos;d known only through the magazines. This is a very rich  sometimes too rich - movie, full of situations, characters and moods, ranging from physical comedy to very moving moments, like the touching and difficult relationship between Adrien and Eva. Though it&apos;s very funny, the general tone is bittersweet : everybody in this movie is not exactly what he/she thinks he/she is, and will have to cope, more or less successfully, with this discovery. AIDS looms over the characters. The movie has been criticized for recycling most of the clichés about gay culture (the characters may be bank executives, but they still act a little like the Cage&apos;s Zaza Napoli), and for being ultimately conservative (gays remain gays and straights remain straights). Still, Pédale douce is very enjoyable, and wonderfully played, with a special mention for Fanny Ardant as the complex, sensitive Eva."

The government steps in, but only makes things worse... far worse.\n\nGeorge Romero&apos;s films have long been known for their violence, disturbing nature, and social commentary and this early film is no exception. The Crazies has exciting action wrapped all in a thought-provoking and unsettlingly believable story. There&apos;s plenty of moments of gore and a number of scenes that are quite horrific (burning preacher anyone?). Romero&apos;s direction is nicely done, providing tense atmosphere and using the rural locations of Pennyslvania well.\n\nCast-wise some of the performances of this film seem a bit forced, but the performers do manage to hold it together. Harold Wayne Jones, Will MacMillian, and Lloyd Hollar are the best stand-outs.\n\nWhile The Crazies is often forgotten among the horror films of the 70&apos;s, it&apos;s a good film from a great director. A must for Romero fans.\n\n*** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "How good is Mary Poppins? I remember singing &quot;Let&apos;s Go Fly a Kite&quot; with my then four year old son when we first got it on a now-lost video. He is now a young man, and little brother is a teenager. I am going to buy the DVD for their children, who may not be born for ten more years. I&apos;ll watch it myself until then. It&apos;s that good. We all have opinions, and mine is that, in the long list of Disney classics and masterpieces, this one is at the top. It is the perfect combination of story, song, characters, actors, whimsy  you name it. I believe it is one of the best movies ever made in any genre.\n\nNeed proof? How many songs can you hum in the car or sing in the shower? Chim Chim Cher-ee; Spoonful of Sugar; Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (thank God for copy and paste); Let&apos;s Go Fly a Kite. What about songs that put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye? Feed the Birds. Great composing, great fit to the story. And Julie Andrews is as good a singer as you will find.\n\nMore proof? What about delightful scenes? A tea party on the ceiling. The fox hunt on merry-go-round horses. Dancing on the rooftops of London.\n\nMemorable characters? Bert, even with his horrible accent, is a blast. Old Mr. Dawes. Uncle Albert. Mrs. Banks, that independent woman (as long as it did not annoy Mr. Banks). Jane and Michael having the experience of a lifetime. And poor Mr. Banks, so concerned with being the lord of his castle but learning the important lessons in the nick of time. His illusion of control begins to unravel the moment that Poppins woman walked in the door, and he never figures out who she is and how she did it to him.\n\nNeither do we, really. She is both the cause of much madness but the stability within it as the story moves along. It is one of Disney&apos;s greatest talents to craft movies and stories that operate on multiple levels. Children love dancing penguins and fireworks. Adults may as well but they can register the message here of what is truly important in life. Poppins has the answers. It is better we don&apos;t analyze who she is  and or course she never explains anything. The Banks family is just glad she was there for a while, and we should be glad that Walt Disney left us with this masterpiece."

And when it started, I read the others actors of the cast! One name better than the previous: Jeff Goldblum, Elijah Wood, Orlando Jones, Tom Wilkinson, David Cross. This is a good point to start watching a unknown movie: discover a beautiful cast. Then, the movie, obviously. I love black comedy and generally all the movie with a lot of different characters which want the same thing(s), like Snatch, Big Trouble And this one is absolutely the best. It&apos;s very funny, which is a very hard thing to find nowadays, few times banal, and it has a tremendous pace (in 1 hour and 35 minutes happens everything you can imagine). Moreover the plot begin almost at the end of the history, and then it&apos;s a flashback followed by another flashback, and so for all the actors, but, that is the best thing about this movie, it&apos;s never really hard to figure out and, although it is complex, it&apos;s easy to rebuild the history, which is globally believable. It&apos;s quite clean (not like the majority of black comedies), unfortunately it has a large number of dirty words (in the Italian version I&apos;ve counted more of 70 of them), but they are proportionate at the characters. So, isn&apos;t a deep movie to think about something, it&apos;s the better way to relax yourself sometimes. Discover it, because isn&apos;t famous at all!",

      "reviewBody": "The sculptor Herr Mariotti is working in his studio with his lover and model, and also having an affair with Frau Elena, Prince Mierbo&apos;s wife. In Herr Mariotti&apos;s studio there is a sculpture of a faun, that mythological creature that represents the first and pure love. One night, when Mariotti leaves his &quot;piccola amica&quot; alone in the studio to go have fun with his other lover as well as playing cards in a den of bourgeoisie vice, the faun comes to life. Soon, thanks to his charms and philosophical thoughts ( after all that&apos;s his speciality; that is to say, playing tricks and chasing lovely maidens ), that mythological creature -half man half goat- will fascinate Herr Mariotti&apos;s model who will fall in love with him/it and will run away with him/it to his particular kingdom. Frau Elena is also interested in the amorous creature and Herr Mariotti&apos;s gambling debts are also part of the plot.\n\n&quot;Il Fauno&quot; (1917) is a very odd silent film even for a German count who has watched a lot of strange silents since the cinema were invented. Italian film directors of that time had a strong interest in the Arts and that is demonstrated in a rather eccentric way in &quot;Il Fauno&quot;, a peculiar mixture of the &quot;fantastique&quot; and romanticism.\n\nThe film is introduced by the director, Herr Febo Mari himself (who also plays the faun in the film) in a theatrical way with a kind of preface wherein the director explains his artistic aims to the audience before the curtain is up. The director thus sets forth his intentions which include a great deal of symbolism, the various characters representing different virtues or weaknesses. Theatrical it may be but it is also very cinematic and uses techniques that were new in the 10&apos;s of the last century.\n\nHerr Mari uses the fantastic and mythological elements together with symbolism and philosophy, in a very clever and entertaining way, sometimes naïf certainly but not at all pedantic. &quot;Il Fauno&quot; is also an interesting portrait of the decadent Italian bourgeoisie who were not very different from their other European counterparts. Obviously the most bizarre and original part of the film is the fantastic one when the satire comes to life and enthralled Herr Mariotti&apos;s model. It is certainly a strange love affair but at its heart not so different from a fully human love encounter because, as the faun explains to the young girl, every man has a heart like a faun. The film has a mystical oneiric atmosphere that combines the real and the unreal and modernity with classicism. What makes the film even more enjoyable is that it has recently been restored complete with the original tints that highlight Herr Febo Mari&apos;s artistic intentions\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because one of his fat Teutonic heiresses is getting this German Count&apos;s goat.",

      "reviewBody": "The manner in which the film was chronographed was somewhat unique. In real time the main character, Morlar, is comatized by severe head trauma. In fact the movie opens with his attempted murder. The unfolding of events in the ensuing investigation are presented with smooth transitions from flashback to present in order to create a sense of fatalistic inevitability. The director takes a very difficult path to achieve this but I think he pulled it off very effectively. Look for little tricks to smooth out the staccato chronological transitions. Small similarities between outgoing and incoming scenes create a more seamless effect.Also, the sounds of a former scene would linger for a couple of seconds after the transition, further uniting past &amp; present to emphasize the inevitable hopelessness of the inspectors situation. It also serves to demonstrate Morlar&apos;s indomitable, fatalistic will.\n\nAll the characters are well (and cleverly)cast, particularly Richard Burton as Morlar. VonGreenway&apos;s book comments on the intensity of Morlar&apos;s character and his riveting gaze. Burton was obviously intimately familiar with the text as his rendition of Morlar is, to say the least, riveting.\n\nThe apocryphal elements added by the director, the cataclysmic disasters vastly improve the story&apos;s big-screen appeal, even if they were a bit of a departure from the text. The director simplifies the text by only indirectly referring to Morlar&apos;s political agenda. To follow the text in this would be setting up an entirely different story and would distract from the immediacy of the peril Morlar represents for the inspector and the psychiatrist.\n\nThe &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; manner in which these two meet serves to show a comprehensive understanding of the text, it gives clear notice (to those familiar with the book) the text cannot realistically be followed in every way. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I was expecting a man.&quot; the inspector explains his reaction to her. &quot;That&apos;s alright, I was expecting an English Inspector.&quot; She responds. This, of course, was a reference to the characters as they appeared in the book.\n\nThis is a well directed film, making sense of a difficult text in an acceptable time frame. Richard Burton was an excellent choice as Morlar, he has a dominating presence that lends well to the character. These things along with an excellent rendition of a sensational, compelling story make the Medusa Touch one of the best suspense films ever.",

      "reviewBody": "This sentimental M-G-M &quot;gangster&quot; film works like a &quot;Tarzan&quot; in reverse: here the seemingly incorrigible hood played by Montgomery, urbane and a touch cynical, finds his cold heart surely melting in the warm embrace of a simple farm family and their soothing workaday life.\n\nIn &quot;Tarzan&quot; Maureen O&apos;Sullivan is the &quot;outsider&quot;, and although she must adjust to life in the jungle the thrust of that story is that she &quot;domesticates&quot; the &quot;ape man&quot; even as she learns to accept the simpler pleasures of living &quot;close to nature&quot;.  Here Montgomery is the one out of his element and we find him mystified by the sounds of crickets in the evening--something almost as strange and foreign to him as the unpretentious caring ways of the Miller family.  When Mom and Pop and little &quot;don&apos;t call me&quot; Willy (played by young Mickey Rooney) conveniently leave the farm for a day, Montgomery and O&apos;Sullivan get to play &quot;farm&quot; (baling the hay, splitting wood) the same way Tarzan and Jane get to play &quot;house&quot; together.  In both cases O&apos;Sullivan has &quot;tamed&quot; the wild beast.\n\n&quot;Tarzan&quot; was an adventure film, however--the journey takes place in the great outdoors and nature is a mirror.  &quot;Hide-out&quot; is an inner journey, on the other hand--even as he&apos;s hauled off to prison Montgomery smiles because he&apos;s finally come &quot;home&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "We taped this off of television when I was very small, and since then one of my aunties taped over it and broke my Mom&apos;s heart. I was lucky enough to find an old library copy of it on ebay, and restore the Christmas tradition to my house. As an arts major, I&apos;m sensible that there can&apos;t be too clean a transition from ballet to &quot;motion picture.&quot; But I believe this film came as close as possible. It is, for the most part, a very well-taped performance of the Pacific Northwest Ballet&apos;s production of &quot;The Nutcracker,&quot; with a few special effects and some narration. It&apos;s filmed on the Seattle Stage, and because of its movie-like qualities it can focus close on the dancer&apos;s faces and shows the great acting skills that many of them possess. I&apos;ve heard a lot of criticism of the seeming obsession Drosselmyer holds with Clara, but I like it. It adds so much more the the scenes in her parent&apos;s party, and I don&apos;t think that he&apos;s got so much of a sexual yearning as he longs to connect with someone, and he loves his little niece. They shoot the family&apos;s congratulations with him when he presents the beautiful doll house, but then they all go off and leave him and, when he tries to join in conversation with Clara, she is afraid of him and backs away. Her fear of him and the sub textual sexual tension are what add to the somewhat erotic and sensual world of her dream, in the palace in Act II. Kent Stowell&apos;s choreography is the best I have ever seen in a production of this ballet, and the orchestra is amazing. I was always a huge fan of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; and &quot;In the Night Kitchen,&quot; so Maurice Sendak&apos;s costumes and sets hold a very special place in my heart. And the passes des deuxes are some of the finest pairs ballet suites I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of watching. All in all, this is my number one favorite holiday film. And if you are lucky enough to get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend you add it to your family&apos;s must-watch list this year. :-)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m so happy to share my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece on Aivars Freimanis (8.02.1936. - 24.01.2018.) death anniversary today. I rewatched this last year as a triple-bill with Vojtech Jasny&apos;s Desire (1958), Andrzej Kondratiuk&apos;s The Four Seasons (1984) as each of these films tackle similar themes in quite different ways!\n\nI saved this review for today and let me start to call this as one of the best visually exquisite piece of art. Aivars Freimanis has shot a poetry with the finest prose. I know it&apos;s an adaptation of &quot;Balta Gramata&quot; (The White Book) by Janis Jaunsudrabins but the technical wondrousity and visual adaption is one of the best ever, cinematically speaking. Latvian poet Imants Ziedonis is also credited as one of the writer of this film.\n\nThe plot is dreamike focussing on little servant boy Jancis and through the course of the film, we get to see him caught in the middle of adults, he doesn&apos;t talk too much, there&apos;s so much going on his mind but says it all with a look, peeping through the windowpanes as things change around him. The window shots are back and forth and works like an invitation to the four seasons as Jancis travels through it. For Jancis it&apos;s the small moments of everyday life that matters but not everything is rosy as the story unfolds. There is also a masterful representation and depiction of Latvian life, culture, and traditions. We get wonderful glimpses of all the characters&apos; lives, including Jancis favourite temporary companions a dog and Jurks, an old man who is not an important person in the village but very special for the former. His bond between Jurks and the Dog features some of the best heartwarming moments in the film. Around this simple story, Aivars Freimanis and cinematographer Davis Simanis weave a visual symphony with strikingly poetic images. It is so beautiful, uninterrupted and visually aesthetic that makes you appreciate each and every shots. I even thought of the Tenghiz Abuladze&apos;s The Wishing Tree (1976), you will know when you watch the film. The Sound design by Igors Jakovlevs feels like a therapeutic experience from start to finish. The soundtrack is by legendary Latvian composer Martins Brauns who passed away last year.\n\nI know this is categorised as a family film, but there is brief nudity with breast and butt exposed in one the best scenes. It is naturalized nudity and non-sexualized which won&apos;t upset anyone.\n\nFinal thoughts, It is a film that fits into its minimal narrative and i&apos;m sure not everyone will sit through it from start to finish. Those who don&apos;t mind the pacing, this will be a huge slog through the landscape, literally, and as a viewing experience it will be delightful which is very rarely matched in cinema. The whole thing is rounded off by a bittersweet ending. I really want to Thank the Studija Lokomotive for their effort in restoring this masterpiece in 4K to its original glory, i really wish Aivars Freimanis was alive to see it!",

Two years earlier we had Lilian Gish, Richard Barthelmess and Donald Crisp acting out a small melodramatic tragedy on sheer acting chops that, even today, through muddy prints, works beautifully. This time, however, we are confronted with Carol Dempster, Charles Emmett Mack and Ralph Graves -- and if you say &quot;Who?&quot; three times like an owl, this movie shows you the incredible loss of acting talent that Griffith had suffered. Confronted with three actors who couldn&apos;t act -- the scene where Dempster is terrified that Graves will rape her is clearly a gloss on Gish&apos;s terror in the closet of two years ago and so inferior that it seems sacrilegious to mention them in the same sentence -- Griffith directed them with a collection of affectations to try to make up for a lack of emotions, and tried to give the entire piece some direction using a framing device of Good Vs. Evil. The total effect is ludicrous.\n\nThere are some good scenes, but the three principals don&apos;t appear in any of them. Give this one a miss.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those mid-sixties NFB productions where rogue filmmakers took what was supposed to be a documentary or short film, turned it into a narrative feature, and basically created the Canadian feature film, such as it is. This one was supposed to be a documentary about snow ploughs, and was transmuted into this shaggy-dog story about an operator trying to get off shift to see his son sing at midnight mass and give his wife a mink coat. So as you can see, this one was NOT heavily influenced by the French new wave ;) The bulk of the movie involves a long social between the guy and his pal the boss, and jump cuts are strenuously avoided in ways that are more awkward than the jump cuts would have been. It&apos;s also a little overextended and clunky. It&apos;s &apos;working class&apos; which I guess is the social selling point, but it&apos;s interesting how the filmmakers transmute that into this general conservatism. Also, it&apos;s dubbed, so the scene where the woman in the department store is talking non-stop English at them loses its whole point. Overall, this one is &apos;interesting,&apos; &apos;a piece of history&apos; etc., not something I&apos;d recommend in and of itself, and useful in de-romanticizing pre-tax-shelter feature film-making in Canada - the scrappy circumstances of production show on screen, and not in a positive way.",

Now that it&apos;s available in all its English subtitled glory, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to view &quot;Tomie: Revenge&quot; and to experience the kind of disappointment that&apos;s all too familiar to &quot;Tomie&quot; fans. The &quot;how could they screw this up?&quot; feeling.\n\nTo summarize the plot of &quot;Tomie: Revenge&quot; is an impossible undertaking simply because there really isn&apos;t one. Most of the film&apos;s ideas are scattershot, thrown to the winds. The threads that connect the characters are painfully thin, and this film has easily the worst Tomie in the series (at least until I see &quot;Tomie: Beginning.&quot;) There are some very good scenes and concepts here, and a few exciting parts, and for what it&apos;s worth, the film does try to at least tie all the &quot;Tomie&quot; films together. But that&apos;s not worth much; even the source material keeps little continuity between the incarnations of Tomie.\n\nThis is the most disjointed film I&apos;ve seen in a long time. Characters appear and disappear with little motivation. Tomie&apos;s personality is radically different from the manga and the previous films; so badly written and acted this Tomie is, that the most exciting scenes involving her are the ones where people are talking about her. The ones she isn&apos;t even actually in.\n\nIf you&apos;re a &quot;Tomie&quot; buff you&apos;re going to see this movie no matter what I say, so go for it. Just don&apos;t show it to your friends.",

      "reviewBody": "Mickey Rourke has to be one of the greatest, yet most under-rated,\n\nAmerican actors alive today.  This film proves it.  He plays this\n\ncharacter with layers and a depth few could accomplish or would\n\neven dare.  Unfortunately, most people regard his personal life\n\n(and abrasive personality itself) with such disdain that they refuse\n\nto fairly judge his professional accomplishments.\n\nRourke plays a grotesquely facially disfigured man who&apos;s life of\n\nridicule, non-existent home-life, and resultant self-guilt have led\n\nhim to a life of crime.  Nothing original there, I&apos;ll admit.  But one\n\nmust watch Rourke&apos;s subtle portrayal to see not a man of rage, as\n\nmost actors would give, and be expected of, from the audience, but\n\na man quietly locked into his world of pain.  The way he holds his\n\ncigarette from the top, so as to cover part of his face; the downward\n\ntilt of his head, eyes averted from anyone&apos;s gaze; or the curt, quiet\n\nspeaking so as not to draw too much attention.  The example of\n\nspeech is in itself remarkable.  Not only does Rourke affect a\n\nsevere speech impediment as the disfigured Johnny Handsome,\n\nbut he then takes on a new one as a man who is now capable of\n\nproper diction, but who is completely unused to being able to\n\nspeak properly.  And he is constant in his portrayal throughout.\n\nThe story is simple but good, driven with excellent visual editing,\n\nand a wonderful sound track (provided by Ry Cooder), that really\n\nsets the pacing.  The cast is largely wonderful, as well, with quite a\n\nfew recognizable &quot;stars&quot;.  Forest Whitaker as the sympathetic but\n\ndriven and demanding doctor, Lance Henrikson and Ellen Barkin\n\nin amazing performances as two completely greedy &quot;scum-bags&quot;,\n\nand Morgan Freeman, in a real role reversal, as a rotten, taunting\n\nparole officer.  Probably the only weak link in the cast is Elizabeth\n\nMcGovern, who&apos;s attempted Louisiana accent never holds up and\n\nover-all acting just suffices.\n\nThis film remains a favorite of mine that I watch every now and\n\nagain, always enjoying it both for the excitingly building tension of\n\nthe story, and the great performances (and performers) littered\n\nthroughout the film.  If you like this film, I also suggest &quot;The\n\nElephant Man&quot;, by David Lynch (for the life-with-disfigurement\n\naspects), or &quot;The Warriors&quot;, by Walter Hill, as a great, early\n\nexample of this same director&apos;s work.\n\n8/10  Mickey Rourke at his best!",

      "reviewBody": "From the director of &apos;Love Actually&apos;, who is also the writer of &apos;Four Weddings and a Funeral&apos;, &apos;Bean&apos;, &apos;Notting Hill&apos; and the &apos;Bridget Jones&apos; films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel. \n\nAlthough it shares some similarities with &apos;The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife&apos; (the same female lead actress, Rachel McAdams) and &apos;Groundhog Day&apos;, but rest assured, &apos;About Time&apos; is a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart. The script was well written, the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles. \n\nThe film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time.\n\nDespite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together.\n\nIt&apos;s one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better than the disappointing &apos;Time Traveler&apos;s Wife&apos;. It&apos;s a great date movie that&apos;s not to be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "The Family Stone was a mixed bag. It had great acting, laugh out loud scenes, and heart breaking moments, but in the meantime, I felt it didn&apos;t know what it wants to be, some of the characters were stereotypes we&apos;ve seen a hundred times before, and I thought some of things happening were totally unbelievable.\n\nThe film tells the story of uptight businesswoman Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) who meets the parents of her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) for the first time during the Christmas celebrations. From the get go, The Stones don&apos;t like Meredith, so she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come back her up.\n\nThe picture didn&apos;t know whether it wants to be a slapstick comedy, or a heartfelt drama. One minute we see pratfalls, the next we wee people crying and talking about the freedom of sexual orientation. These fast mood swings really hurt the movie, as it was at its best when it kept the same tone for more than 10 minutes; I was laughing out loud at the Chritmas morning scenes, and I was really touched by the scene between Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig. T Nelson) in the bed.\n\nThe movie had a lot of characters, but unfortunately, only half of these characters were interesting. The best character was Sybil, the loving and strong mother who keeps all the family together. I also liked Everett, the man who wasn&apos;t sure of the decision he&apos;s going to make. Anyway, there also some stereotypes like Meredith and Amy (Rachel McAdams), the annoying sister who was just there to hurt Meredith. I felt Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) and her daughter Elizabeth (Savannah Stehlin) were in the picture just to add a cute little girl to the mix. And I think the film could have used more time to give us a better idea of some characters like Julie and Ben (Luke Wison). But it&apos;s always a good sign when you wish a film was longer; Frankly, I was entertained throughout the film.\n\nThe Family Stone had a great cast, with some actors giving their best performances in a long time, and I&apos;m surprised no one from the cast was nominated for an Academy award. Diane Keaton was terrific as the mother, and her first and last scenes in the movie are truly heartbreaking. And although I&apos;m not a fan of Parker, I thought she pulled of her role quite well. In fact, I think Danes is the only cast member who gave a so-so performance.\n\nSo, I&apos;d recommend The Family Stone, but with a cast like this, I can&apos;t help but think this film could have been much better.",

The film is very good.\n\nI was intrigued by Emily Blunt&apos;s presence in the film so I downloaded it and was very surprised because it turned out to be so much better than I expected. There is one noteable thing about it - almost all the situations that are supposed to make you laugh are at least 1/3 unfunny as they are. This is a very believable quality about the film - it makes you look at life from a distance and understand that all those stupid actions and decisions that people make are just funny as hell. And with a little love you can even come to a happy-end (I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a spoiler, this is obviously not Macbeth, you knew a happy end was there). But this is what makes this film an actual challenge for some people. It is NOT PLEASANT. It does not put you into a dreamy or giggly state. It is actually quite raw, sarcastic and real. I do believe that we live in times when real things are considered unnerving and even evil. Some people would very much rather have safe spaces built in every corner of the city and not deal with reality. Well, in true love there are no safe spaces. True love makes you stay with a person through all the ugly things and through the funny things and through the good things, obviously.\n\nActing is on the spot. Everyone knows that Emily Blunt is one of the most talented actresses. Jason Segel is handsome and compelling, support cast entertain you in every possible way. The dialogues are great. Everything sounds very natural.\n\n7 our of 10 - because 10 is Fellini and Visconti. One of the best modern chick flicks I&apos;ve ever seen.",

Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I &apos;ve never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. \n\nBut in this way it poetically conveys within it&apos;s form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility.\n\nA bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It&apos;s also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don&apos;t see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. \n\nIt could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind."

      "description": "Feeling a lack of purpose in her life as her teenage children Emily and Max grow increasingly independent, and her husband, Mike, devotes most of his time and energy to his growing business, Anna Sparrow follows the advice of her Pastor and volunteers at the local food bank. While helping the disadvantaged, Anna meets Maria Sanchez. From very different backgrounds, the two women bond over their shared love for their families. As the women grow closer, Maria reveals her concern for her precocious, but lonely daughter Bella, who she fears is being bullied at school. At Anna&apos;s urging, her teenage daughter Emily takes Bella under her wings. Maria&apos;s husband, Hector, loses his job, and his ability to provide for his family. He falls into despair as he&apos;s unable to find work, and turns back to drinking. When he finds Maria at the Sparrow&apos;s house, he assumes she is cleaning houses. His pride overcomes him and demands she leave with him. Anna agrees to watch Bella as Maria leaves with Hector, hoping to reason with him, make him understand how much she loves him, and that she knows he is always there for his family. A short time later, the police arrive at the Sparrow residence with devastating news. As they weigh the impact on young Bella, Anna and Mike face one of the most important decisions of their lives.",

Raw; that s what the main character is; I know plenty of these beings. I think that they tend to have some kind of mental retardation, among lack of education and social skills. He only knows to deal the basic way in all the fronts; mainly lying around. May be the director tried to show a character that does not find his place or way in a modern urbanized society. Mirai Moriyama is perfect in the roll; the face, the expressions, gestures, movements. Great acting. Shinji Imaoka is the screen writer; putting some pinku moments. There s few camera shots that are very good and out of the norm. Good movie.",

The plot is ridiculous and full of inconsistencies and huge plot holes made only to rush out of some scenes that clearly would have led to nothing. Then I know that the actors are just children and one shouldn&apos;t be bad but the acting is really painful, it seems like the actors don&apos;t put the slightest effort into anything they do and this shows in practically all the scenes. Then the ending is terrible because it could also make sense but it is so hasty that it loses even the slightest semblance of sense that it could have.",

It&apos;s really a lovely film and it&apos;s unfortunate more people don&apos;t have a chance to see it. I just recommended it to a friend last night as a good example of a Czech film that isn&apos;t dour, but sadly it doesn&apos;t seem to be available in the US. I am not ordinarily a great fan of movies about children, but this film is an exception. In the film, a little girl responds to her parents&apos; marital troubles by imagining everything through the lens of a sort of Little Red Riding Hood fantasy. It was graceful and unexpected and I hope some day I&apos;ll be able to stream it online or something.",

      "reviewBody": "I have just come from the FRENCH FILM FESTIVAL in Richmond, VA (2008), where I saw this film. I don&apos;t view a lot of American films, so I can&apos;t adequately compare, but I do know American film makers don&apos;t develop relationships between people the way French film makers do. While American films seem to give little short glimpses into people&apos;s lives, French film makers give us long conversations between actors and show us how one person can change the life of another.\n\nIn this film, the artist comes home to his roots. When he advertises for a gardener to work the potager at his old family home, an old school mate applies for the job. As they reconnect through the work, each contributes to the other&apos;s life. It&apos;s interesting to see how the artist&apos;s paintings changed as he was influenced by his friend.\n\nThe film deals with life, death, family, gardening, painting, sickness and other realities of life. The scenery is beautiful, the actors realistic, and the story believable.\n\nWhen the director answered questions at the end of the screening, it was very interesting to hear the Americans trying to insert and look for symbolism in many of the scenes, but the director&apos;s replies indicated that symbolism was not intended, rather bare content.\n\nI so enjoyed this film and wish I had a copy of it to entertain others with at my home. English subtitles are there, but if you understand French, you will get much more out of this movie. I found the English subtitles very British and not conveying the French spirit at times, but if you don&apos;t know the difference, it won&apos;t matter.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Robin-B-Hood&quot; is one of the better recent Jackie Chan movies I have seen. Why? Well, obviously because of the trademark Jackie Chan action sequences, but also because of the story in the movie.\n\nJackie Chan (playing Fong Ka Ho) and Louis Koo (playing Octopus) are two professional burglars that live extravagant lives that require a lot of spending money, and get hired for job that promises million of Hong Kong dollars, though Michael Hui (playing Landlord) fails to inform his burglar associates that the job is to kidnap a baby. Fong Ka Ho and Octopus get attached to the baby, and then things start to escalate to a wild thrill-ride.\n\nJackie Chan puts on a great performance in this movie, as expected, and he is doing all of his trademark action and stunts, lots of action and comedy here. And he is well accompanied by Louis Koo who also puts on a good performance. I am a huge fan of Asian cinema and used to live in Hong Kong so I am no strangers to the Hong Kong cinema, and I must say that Charlene Choi (playing Pak Yin), despite her small role, actually put on one of her best performances ever. It is nice to see that she is finally growing into a good actor and is over that sugar-coated silly comedy that she made when she was younger.\n\nThe story in the movie have several aspects and depths and all work out quite nicely coming together full circle at the end. &quot;Robin-B-Hood&quot;, despite the somewhat stupid title, is a really great action and family movie. Very suitable for fans of Jackie Chan or people in for an evening with the family. And I must underline that &quot;Robin-B-Hood&quot; is a MUST for all Jackie Chan fans. Sure he is getting older, but the man is still performing amazing stunts and spreading his good humor.\n\nI was thoroughly entertained from the start of the movie until the very end. And I purchased the 2-disc Ultimate Edition from Amazon, and will definitely be giving the extra materials on disc 2 a go later on today.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, I mean the movie actually is crap. But if you consider the budget with which the film was shot, there are even some elements that appear quite inventive/creative in the picture. Thilo Gosejohann shot this film from 1992 - 1998 in Germany with a financing that actually didn&apos;t exist and a crew of volunteers who, although most of them lacking theatrical abilities, obviously seemed to enjoy themselves acting their parts and the movie manages to convey the spirit of enthusiasm during the production of the film with nearly no budget. The story is really at a level quite below anybody might even imagine, but it&apos;s so surreal and sometimes consciously overdrawn that a not too small group over here in Europe consider the movie Cult - not only is it most often intentionally crappy and funny but there are also many references to other flicks and homages in it. Tough it might prove difficult to get a copy in America - over here on the old continent it can easily be ordered at Amazon (two editions, Powerb**ch - rated 18+ - and Greenhorn - 12+ - edition). Thilo Gosejohann put a considerable extend of violence into the Powerb**ch edition, which people with an affinity for truly black and sick humor (including myself) might consider funny - ever seen people fencing with spinal columns taken from previously killed corpses? Though it appears comical most of the time - not explicitly perverse or violent. If you ever manage to come across a copy of that role-model of independent film-making, give it a chance. Concerning features and (personal opinion herein) fun I would prefer the Powerb**ch edition, although people sensitive to violence might want to take the Greenhorn edition.",

Her accent here is flimsy. But her white skin was perfect for the period&apos;s bright lights and slow film. We see and understand well her expressions.\n\nThis film shows garters and a surprising morality. The gold-digger gets her gold, conniving and finagling all the way. It seems that a beautiful young woman, who confidently knows what she is, can get anything she wants from a man. Classic Jean Harlow (and I guess Anita Loos). Harlow&apos;s act is not ditzy coquette - she knows exactly what she&apos;s doing and so do we. It&apos;s fun to watch the story unfold.\n\nThe men are props but acquit themselves well. Charles Boyer, accent and all, plays the apparently genuine love interest. Watch for the scene where his character is accused of having an affair with a woman already having an affair. Only Boyer could get the right pause before answering matter-of-factly. This was one of his first American films."

The characters and the situations are hilarious but maybe the funniest scene is Medusa meeting the last hope to save Earth, Pluthar.

Though her narration is a little on the descriptive side, Claudine Nougaret takes us on quite a fascinating look at events filmed over his extensive career by acclaimed photo-journalist Raymond Depardon. We feature just about everything here from the French colonial events in Africa - the much medalled Bokassa included, through a succession of French Presidents dealing with issues across their country from immigration and industrial relations to poverty and urban troubles. Clearly as time progresses, so does the camera technology used allowing us even greater and more intimate access to his subjects as Nougaret incorporates occasional sound-bites from contemporaries to put some extra meat on the bones of these frequently quite potent images. For the most part, the photography was self-filmed by Depardon and in some of the more hostile or less developed environments, you do realise quite effectively just how perilous his projects were as he accessed areas and people in his quest for honest journalism. It&apos;s certainly a journal of France&apos;s recent history, but there&apos;s plenty for others to get from the narrative and the well constructed use of the archive.",

The meaning in German Wolke 9 or Cloud nine means that a person is full of happiness through being in love and passion with another person, hence sailing on Cloud 9. I don&apos;t argue that this could not happen to a well mature couple, but it was lacking in this movie. From an aesthete point of view it was not necessary to show closes ups of the aged bodies. I remember the movie Cocoon, which had a lot more sense, action and humor, also relating to older couples that enjoy or rediscover love and passion. Even the few spoken dialogs were motionless. I believe that the story had more potential than it showed. Well, just my opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "In Canadian director Kari Skogland&apos;s film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley, a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end, stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well-meaning son Marvin. Filmed in Manitoba, Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka, The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century.\n\nThe title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar&apos;s mother&apos;s grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar&apos;s inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime. Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven, self-defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father, her well-meaning but alcoholic husband, and both of her sons. As she nears the end of her days, she reflects that &quot;pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear. I was alone, never anything else, and never free, for I carried my chains within me, and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched&quot;.\n\nConfronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home, Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships, her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration. The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl. Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly, she meets her future husband, the previously married Bram Shipley (Cole/Wings Hauser), a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population. The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role. Despite Hagar&apos;s pleading, her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot. This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka, condemning the young couple to a life of poverty.\n\nGoing through the motions of her marriage to Bram, Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town&apos;s upper classes. When she produces two sons, Marvin (Dylan Baker) and John (Kevin Zegers), she is unable to give them the love that they need. &quot;Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning&quot;, she reflects, &quot;all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearancesWhen did I ever speak the heart&apos;s truth?&quot; Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride, Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm.\n\nAs the scene shifts back to the present, Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris (Sheila McCarthy), Here she meets a young man named Leo (Luke Kirby) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story&apos;s outcome, although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John&apos;s devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film&apos;s second half.",

Dialog, acting (if you can call it that), script in general, almost nothing seems to work. If you see it as a horror movie that is. So in keeping in tradition with the latest &quot;Giallo&quot; (not only the movie, but also) by Argento, it stays true to the master by being as ridiculous as possible.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong there are good actors in this and it was produced by the wonderful Marcia Grazia Cuccinota, but those ingredients do not work. Which made me feel a bit bad for the filmmakers and the producers at the Frightfest screening were I watched this. Because most people were laughing and obviously the producers were stunned in a negative way about that development. Something that was one of the things people talked about after the screening.\n\nSo sit back, relax and prepare yourself for one of the most hilarious comedies you&apos;ve seen in 2012. Even I had to surrender to the sheer weight of nonsense and couldn&apos;t resist laughing. Better than crying, I tell ya",

This is most assuredly not a film for everyone. It has to be classified as science fiction, but it rarely feels like one. A woman goes to spend a weekend in a isolated cabin and is kept captive by some sort of invisible wall or force field of some sort. Rather than sci-fi, this plays like some sort of cerebral meditation on the joys and pain of loneliness, mostly the latter. This film also involves numerous animals and the trapped character&apos;s connection with them. Some of this aspect is touching, but some of it is difficult to watch, especially one scene. This is no doubt slow as some have been critical of, but I found quite a bit of it sort of intriguing. It is a one woman show starring the acclaimed German actress, Martina Gedeck. There were a few things that annoyed me, primarily a couple of things not explored, but overall this is an interesting film for the serious minded viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "In the film &quot;...In The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; renown director Louis Malle takes a look at life as an immigrant in America- from the perspective of an outsider. It focuses on the rather paradoxical relationship that exists between immigrants and America(ns). How immigrants are an integral and important part of the country&apos;s prosperity- it is a &quot;Nation of Immigrants&quot;, for God&apos;s sake (pun intended), lest we forget- yet still contains factions that both fear and resent the presence of new immigrants (particularly if you are latino, these days).\n\nThese immigrants are doctors, astronauts, restaurateurs, labourers and even work on top secret government programs. Throughout the film Malle interviews a number of new immigrants and their families- all of whom make deeply intuitive observations and commentaries- discussing why they have come to America from their various places of origin. These people have been lured to America for various reasons- coming from various ethnic and national backgrounds- from all over the world. Some are nobodies seeking to establish themselves and &quot;become someone&quot;, while others were quite established in their homeland, but left to seek a new start or just to blend in (ie. General Samoza- former Dictator of Nicaragua- who now passes his time watching Mexican Soaps while his children run a series of restaurants).\n\nAll of the immigrants interviewed throughout the film possess a sense of hope- though this hope manifests itself in various ways- whether it be ambition, oppourtunity, freedom of choice, a chance to escape oppression or even to live a life like their favourite American TV show. This first section of the film documents what it is like for these new immigrants when they come to a new land, become indoctrinated into America&apos;s dumbed down materialistic corporate culture and then break free from this; creating their own cultural niches- making their own way and doing their own thing in the land of oppourtunity.\n\nThe film also focuses, though, on the challenges that immigrants face when coming up against the aforementioned great American paradox. That of the white ruling class and their attempt to balance being a nation of immigrants while not losing touch with the inherently American trait of fearing &quot;the other&quot;. This is spurred on by the type of people that want to keep in touch with the &quot;Founding fathers&quot;- like the bigot that Malle interviews in the film- although these tensions also manifest themselves when different immigrant communities are pitted against one another (ie like the Blacks vs Vietnamese); or when facing racial stereotypes from across the spectrum. These are not the only challenges they face though, they also suffer from a homesickness as they are disconnected from their culture and relatives; feel the affects of assimilation and loss of communal living (replaced by the American brand of radical individualism); face the challenge of passing their culture and values onto their children; and, of course, deal with issues that come with the language barrier.\n\nOverall Malle presents a fair and balanced picture of the great paradox that exists between America and it&apos;s Immigrants- from the perspective that only an outsider (ie transplanted European) could bring. It is both interesting, informative and nicely shot (for the most part interviewer is off camera, with interviewees looking right into the camera- reminiscent of some early Peter Greenaway docs and Errol Morris&apos; infamous use of the interotron). In light of recent anti-immigrant sentiment that has been exposed in southern states like Arizona, this documentary is possibly more relevant now than it has ever been. Highly recommended. 8 out 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Breakheart Pass is a wicked tough, badass Charles Bronson action vehicle steeped in the macho charm on the 1970&apos;s, and filled with ever changing photography as a train hurtles across the Nevada and Idaho mountains during a snowy winter. Onboard is John Deakins (Bronson), a dangerous outlaw being transported as prisoner to a remote, well guarded fort somewhere deep in the wilderness. Deakins isn&apos;t who he seems though, and neither is anyone else onboard for that matter. When a murder occurs, he takes it upon himself to wage a bloody crusade on everyone else in order to find the truth about what&apos;s going on, and the truth about their frozen voyage. Bronson is nails tough, doing some deliriously sketchy stunts and engaging in blessedly R rated, pretty intense violence for 70&apos;s standards. The cast is stacked, other passengers include Ed Lauren, David Huddleston, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning and Ben Johnson as the ruthless federal marshal in charge of Deakin&apos;s transport. A rock solid genre picture, thrilling, decked out in western production design and filled with savage, bullet ridden, bone breaking set pieces."

      "reviewBody": "This is such an under rated film that I just do not understand why so little attention has been given to Christmas of Many Colors. Maybe today&apos;s society is so tied up in social media and taking selfies that inspirational films such as Dolly Parton&apos;s latest production that reflect a very strong family bond and selflessness are considered passe?\n\nHeck, we are well past the Christmas season but I just watched this film for the first time and now I wished I had watched it sometime in December as I am sure it would have motivated me even more so to spend more time with my own family and close friends. \n\nThe little girl who plays the pre-teen Dolly Parton, Alyvia Alyn Lind is an amazing actress. There are a handful of people blessed with the God-given talent who shine in front of the camera and Alyvia Alyn Lind is most certainly one of those brightest of today&apos;s stars and she will continue to shine brightly for many, many years to come. She reminds me a lot of both a young Shirley Temple and Jodie Foster. Dolly herself has always said she liked to perform from a very young age and that she loved to be the center of attention. Alyvia Alyn Lind who plays young Dolly wants so badly to star in her 1955 Christmas pageant in the starring role as the virgin Mother Mary that she prays to God for the opportunity and she sucks up big time to her teacher Miss Moody, played to perfection by Mary Lane Haskell. There is a few scenes where the interaction between young Dolly and her teacher made me cry with tears of joy.\n\nI know this film is loosely based on Dolly Parton&apos;s own family life and I assume that Dolly took many liberties in embellishing some of the mini-miracles that are reflected in Christmas Of Many Colors but if you take the time &quot;as a family&quot; to sit down together and watch this film you will see why these mini-miracles are key to this inspirational story.\n\nDolly&apos;s parents Robert Lee Parton (Ricky Schroder) and Avie Lee Parton (Jennifer Nettles) are back again for this film sequel to the 2015 film Coat of Many Colors. Who would not want Robert Lee and Avie Lee to be their parents? They emit love and kindness even with a house full of wall to wall children and little money to spare. The entire cast including Reverend Jake Jones played by Gerald McRaney who plays Avie Lee&apos;s father and Dolly&apos;s grandfather, and her Uncle Billy played by Cameron Jones are all well cast. Heck, even Dolly Parton has a few cameo appearances in this sequel that are inspirational and I believe Dolly included these scenes as her dream did come true.\n\nSo this film encompasses the Christmas spirit at its best, from the Christmas pageant, to the power of prayer, to the gift of giving being so much more inspirational than the gift of receiving. I believe this film, The Christmas of Many Colors will become a family tradition in the vein of the 1946 film It&apos;s a Wonderful Life.\n\nI really enjoyed The Christmas of Many Colors: the Circle of Love and it will be on Mrs. Shullivan&apos;s and especially my must watch Christmas season watch list for many years to come. It is a Christmas classic!\n\nI give it 10 for 10 shiny Christmas ornaments and a must add to our Christmas tree watch list.",

It has every sub plot you could want in you&apos;re average film and especially in a western.  They have a great cast on board also to establish this gang of ragger muffins.  Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is just as good as Costner and Lancaster were.  Val Kilmer is probably the main reason why every fan of it&apos;s genre talk about it so much as he is not just a fine actor in this but you believe that Doc Holiday and him were somehow related as he takes on the exact same sense of humour which I have read in books and his likeness is there also from what I have seen in pictures.  \n\n Val Kilmer has been in a lot of films but only half of them were good and this goes into one of his best along with Oliver Stone&apos;s The Doors and Willow without doubt has to get a mention.   There is a superb cast here which makes up of Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, Billy Zane and of course Charlton Heston.   I could go on for even longer mentioning some of the great actors that star in this but the sheer action of vengeance of it make it one of the best action westerns. There are your two type of westerns like High Noon and The Searchers which are very calm but intense films.  Then you have The Wild Bunch and Tombstone which are just blood thirsty with plenty of action to cater for all tastes of films.\n\nI am not to familiar with the director but he is surely missed as far as making a western like this is concerned."

      "reviewBody": "In TO DIE FOR, Suzanne Stone (the glorious Nicole Kidman) is an ultra-ambitious, wannabe media megastar. This takes a certain type of person without fear, heart, or conscience. Stone puts her soulless tendencies to work, building her TV career by any means necessary.\n\nSuzanne is driven to be in reality what she&apos;s always been in her own blank mind. She will be famous no matter what it takes. This includes relentless self-promotion and the murder of her impossibly clueless husband (Matt Dillon).\n\nMs. Kidman plays Suzanne Stone with gusto as an empty shell with a magnificent paintjob. She slithers and slinks along, manipulating the foolish (including a wonderful trio of lunkheads played by Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, and Alison Folland) and living only to be noticed.\n\nThis is a fantastic black comedy about the hollowness of celebrity and those who achieve it..."

      "reviewBody": "FRENCH CONNEXION was the first of French pornographer Marc Dorcel&apos;s luxury productions that I saw, and remains the standard of many more he&apos;s cranked out in a career dating back all the way to 1979.\n\nHis approach, which has been copied in America by such labels as Digital Playground, is to throw obvious money on the screen in the form of vast female cast lists and oodles of production value. The contrast with standard claustrophobic porn (not advanced much since the &apos;70s chintzy &quot;two folks f*cking in a motel room&quot;) is striking, and has attracted a fairly loyal audience.\n\nNot to belabor the plot, this is a kind of Andy Sidaris movie gone mad with hardcore -as if the late great sexy action filmmaker (or his peer Russ Meyer) had lost his mind and filled the screen with condom-encased big European dicks double penetrating beautiful Eastern European starlets.\n\nThe international locations are impressive, though the storyline of Russian gangsters and partly true blue/partly corrupt French cops and agents makes less sense than a &apos;50s Lemmy Caution thriller starring Eddie Constantine or a &apos;60s German action film starring George Nader. Tony Carrera as tough cop Tony is an okay hero and many of the actresses were a turn-on, notably Jessica Fiorentino, Stacy Silver, Yasmine and Lydia St. Martin.\n\nLead role is ably performed, pre-breast surgery by Katsumi, who is still one of the best d.p. specialists in the business. Her confusing name history is a pet peeve of mine: first she was rechristened Katsuni in as terrifying a re-writing of history as when the under-legal-threat (good old World Wildlife Federation breathing down Vince&apos;s neck) WWF changed its name to WWE and promptly pretended in broadcasts and literature that it had ALWAYS been named WWE. More recently IMDb has rechristened her everywhere as Celine Tran, a moniker as far as I can tell she never (or at best rarely) uses professionally.\n\nWell, for me she will always be Katsumi, and possessing natural breasts -that&apos;s old school and the way I like it. You can see from her thumbnail photo that if she isn&apos;t careful with continued surgery she might turn into Cher."

      "reviewBody": "We don&apos;t know. We think we do but we don&apos;t. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we&apos;ve made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can&apos;t be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry&apos;s THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he&apos;s ever been from himself?\n\nOf course, when you&apos;re a sixteen-year-old boy and a woman who looks like Kate Winslet disrobes in front of you in the privacy of her bathroom, how much thought really goes into the decision that has presented itself? However little it is, it is certainly less than is warranted. This is especially true in West Germany of 1958. This is a Germany that is uncertain how to proceed, how to be its new self in the eyes of the world and the eyes of its very own future generations. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a compassionate woman but also abrasive and stern. Winslet strikes the perfect balance between directness and desire in Schmitz, making her complexities part of her appeal. She is a good fifteen years older than the young Berg and she knows much better than he of her country&apos;s history. What he knows, he has read in books, been taught in school. What she knows, she lived first hand. So when the two come together, naked in each other&apos;s arms, the meeting is as redemptive as it is passionate. Berg is just happy to be in love and having sex but Schmitz is washing herself clean with the youthful vigor of Germany&apos;s tomorrow.\n\nThe summer ends and so does the affair, as one would expect. Just when it would seem that the two would never meet again, life steps in to ensure that past decisions, perhaps made in haste, can come to see their consequences. Berg has grown some and is a college man, studying to be a lawyer, when he catches sight of Hanna Schmitz again. Their latest chance encounter is far less exciting though as he sees her on a class outing to a courthouse. Schmitz is on trial for crimes against humanity for her time as an officer in the Nazi party during the Second World War. Berg&apos;s memory of his first love would now become a question of his own morality. How could he love someone who was now accused of such atrocities? How could he be so intimate with someone he apparently never truly knew? And yet, now that he knows her past, does he really know how her past came to be? After all, what is the face of evil? Is it Hanna Schmitz or is it something incredibly bigger than her?\n\nRalph Fiennes is the future of Germany. He plays Berg as an adult. His life is orderly, very clean, crisp and cold. He made decisions that made him the man he is and he can never say whether they were the right ones or not. What he can see is that we all make decisions that either hurt or harm other people and that the atrocities committed by his past generations are not as far outside the realm of understanding as he might have originally thought. More importantly, redemption is not that far either.",

It is a solid mystery story, with a plot that is almost logical and can be followed rather easily. (The idea of course reminded me of the hilarious Arsenic and Old Lace, but this was a completely different thing. I guess, Edgar Wallace wrote his novel earlier, and maybe Joseph Kesslering read it, maybe he didn&apos;t.)\n\nHeinz Drache plays the detective, Ingrid van Bergen plays, in one of her rare Wallace appearances, the beautiful girl that needs to be protected. Klaus Kinski is a sinister character on the verge between genius and madness. So there is nothing new concerning the cast (only Eddi Arent is missing, but I didn&apos;t really miss him), no world-shattering surprises, except maybe at the end. Good Sunday-afternoon suspense.",

Try this.....\n\n&quot;L&apos;Arbre De Noel&quot; Terence Young ,1969."

Nonetheless, the movie can be given a shot provided that you haven&apos;t seen Charade, otherwise the main suspense in the plot would be obvious, and the movie would be a drag. A couple of songs are hummable, though."

Of course it was rather conceived as an &quot;advertisment&quot; for the French aircrafts (Mirage) and the carrier &quot;Clemenceau&quot; to show how good they were (or would be) to face a nuclear threat ! No special effects were used in the film of course and the &quot;threat&quot; was only suggested - nothing to do with later films showing alien monsters ! What I liked was an almost &quot;documentary&quot; description of life on board - a floating city as we used to say -which was rather rare in those days because of the &quot;cold war&quot;. Unfortunately it seems this movie does not exist on DVD and even here in Europe it&apos;s never shown on TV.",

The acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. The saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails miserably, which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. I&apos;d only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if you&apos;re really into biker films.",

I really had no idea what the film would be about given I hadn&apos;t seen many trailers and only knew elements of the story from the synopsis I read of it on Rotten Tomatoes. So I went in with a pretty clean slate.\n\nThe film jumps right into things and doesn&apos;t really take a lot of pit stops. It charges forward with the story and I think that is the thing I appreciated the most about it. We are not weighted down with too much subplot and extraneous emotional scenes. We are given exactly what we need to form a connection with all the characters.\n\nThe film is changed some from the book that it is based on. Mainly that the lead character played by John Cusack is a widower rather than homosexual. In the end, it really doesn&apos;t matter the sexuality of the Cusack character, the connection he creates with his son is fantastic to watch develop. They are the same, though different in that one is grounded in reality and the other up in Mars some where. Both are individuals in a world that doesn&apos;t want different, the want everyone to do exactly as they are expected to.\n\nLoved the film, will be a definite purchase come DVD time.",

That&apos;s understandable, and for the most part it works well, but I feel that these guys are talented enough to go all in on a legitimate film that isn&apos;t relying on their fan-base.\n\nSpace Cop is entertaining. The opening hostage situation is old school slapstick, but it works as a set-up. I loved the matter of fact way that Space Cop seamlessly finds himself working for the local police without any attempt to hide his character, and Mike&apos;s trench coat revived detective creates a perfect comical partnership. Unfortunately I&apos;m not a big fan of the scripted stuff. Yes there are funny moments, but it never felt like the natural and spontaneous chemistry between Rich and Mike was given any room. A lot of the humour came from seeing funny and talented guys from RLM performing in a film, rather than funny and talented guys simply being funny and talented. Clearly they&apos;re not going to make an unintentionally bad film, but why not try to make a genuinely good comedy film. They should back themselves with a bit of confidence in their ability, instead of hiding behind the &apos;nudge nudge wink wink&apos; approach.\n\nI&apos;d love to see them try their hand at a found footage horror. Mike, Jay, and Rich performing deadpan in one of those cliched door-slamming, forest-running, cellar-screaming set-ups would be a sight to behold.",

It signifies neither assent or disagreement, just obedience to official orders. You have to watch the face or listen to the tone to decide whether the recipient is enthused, annoyed or resigned. Such is life on the western front of an RAF outpost during WW1 - and where life is a fragile commodity.\n\nAlso known as &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, it was remade in 1938. That&apos;s the one I knew from Million Dollar Movie on Ch. 9 in NYC, and it would play for a whole week. I loved it and watched it as often as I could. I thought no one could beat Errol Flynn and David Niven in the two lead roles, until I saw the original, &quot;Flight Commander&quot; which starred Richard Barthelmess, Neil Hamilton and Douglas Fairbanks,Jr. (Basil Rathbone played the Neil Hamilton role as Commander of the doomed fliers in the &apos;38 version). The acting was far superior in the earlier version, but the later one had better production values. It seems some of the same great aerial footage was used in both films.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I like this (1930) version better as it was emotionally more satisfying; it had more &apos;heart&apos;. And Richard Barthelmess was an excellent actor who for some reason couldn&apos;t last in talking pictures. I also thought this may have been Fairbanks&apos; best acting job. Well, that&apos;s my take on the two films, and that&apos;s the best part of going to the movies - it&apos;s often subjective, and there&apos;s no accounting for taste."

      "reviewBody": "Honestly, I think this movie deserves a good solid 5. In a world where AMAZING movies rank between 8-10, this one falls into this area. So compared to amazing..this movie is...well it&apos;s not bad. It&apos;s kinda good even. Here&apos;s my reasons why.\n\nThis movie comes off as very original. I can honestly say I had no clue what was going on, and I couldn&apos;t guess what was going to happen next.\n\nThis is not a &quot;horror&quot; film. To be honest I&apos;m not sure what genre this movie falls into. I suppose it falls a bit into the same category as movies like &quot;The Cabin&quot; or &quot;Shrooms&quot;. It has horror elements to it. It has suspense. It has gore. It has at times cheesy dialog. It also has the typical badass hot chick that tend to show up in these types of movies.\n\nThe plot is as follows. A group of friends, some of which have served in the forces, and one of said friends girlfriends go on a hunting trip at one of their deceased uncles cabins. They are there to hunt wild bore. In the local area there are &quot;clans&quot; of hills people, who hunt and for the most part live off the land. Normally you&apos;d think they would be the main antagonist from the get go, but you&apos;d be wrong. They actually help the &quot;friends&quot; on their hunting trip.\n\nWhile hunting, they run into many obstacles, including pot fields, crazy hippys, and insane hill people out for murder.\n\nOverall this was a fun watch. The acting is pretty bad sometimes, some of the plot points aren&apos;t points at all, some characters make horrible decisions, and some things are left completely unresolved. Also there&apos;s some weird person just staring at you in the end. I still have no idea what that was about.\n\nIn the end I&apos;d say give it a watch. It&apos;s a fun and crazy film. Don&apos;t expect too much and you&apos;ll enjoy it.",

This means we are stuck with the American dialogue rather than the original, and the editing may be quite different. Thus, we are watching (and critiquing) a film not as it was ever intended to be seen.\n\nWhile much of what remains is amusing, it does tend to get boring. With Godzilla it never gets old, but with Yongary we can only see him smashing things for so long before it seems like the same old thing over and over. What other tricks do we have? None?",

      "reviewBody": "The film begins with a VERY novel way of telling the back story. So, instead of showing the old woman hiding her jewels inside one of twelve chairs, you see a cartoon do this inside the actual house used in the live action film. It&apos;s very cute and I love when a film goes about doing something differently.\n\nAs I just said, the story is about an old woman from what is now communist Cuba who has hidden her jewels so they won&apos;t be confiscated by the state. She tells her heir (a nephew) about this secret stash on her death bed--but by now it&apos;s too late. It seems that the government has already done some redistributing and all 12 of the chairs have been given to 12 different strangers--and the nephew needs to hurry, as he needs to track down the chairs before their secret is revealed. The story, it seems, is from a Russian novel about the post-Czarist USSR--giving this film a very interesting pedigree.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty decent comedy but not an outstanding one. I think the plot, though funny, rarely was THAT funny. I think it could have used a bit more humor and the performances seemed a bit too restrained. Not bad--but not especially memorable.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar to you, it might be because you&apos;ve already seen the Mel Brooks film &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot;--which is a remake of this Cuban film. In fact, this would seem like a good film to add to my Netflix queue, as I remember my family adored the Brooks film. But I was only six when I saw it in the theater, so it&apos;s not like I have much recollection of it. Perhaps if I do this, I&apos;ll update my review of the Cuban original to explain how the two films compare.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie along with Wife to Be Sacrificed were the standard for almost every Roman Porno film that came after. Based on the Oniroku Dan S&amp;M novel, Flower and Snake. This was the first Roman Porno to have an S&amp;M theme.\n\nThe story is a 30 year old man, still living with his mother who operates an adult novelty (magazines, photos &amp; toys) store. The man&apos;s boss asks him to kidnap and train his wife who has been denying him during their marriage. While the man is inexperienced except for seeing his mother taking photo shoots obliges.\n\nKeep in mind that although this film falls under the Nikkatsu studio&apos;s Roman Porno, that means romantic porno (not the western definition of porno), falls under the Pink Eiga movie category and only softcore at that. And in the 1970&apos;s Japanese film censorship was very strict. This film does have rope bondage and it is very real including suspension. There is also enemas and other things but is never shown on camera. All including sex scenes are strictly simulated.\n\nThe film itself often is rebuked by a western audience. But it had its place within Japanese (not mainstream) culture of the time. The bondage, sex scenes and fetishes are definitely part of the story. The characters and their development would make no sense without it.\n\nThe acting by the entire cast is first-rate. Naomi Tani, who was known as the &quot;Queen Of S&amp;M&quot; is exceptional as usual. She would famously only appear in films with an S&amp;M theme. The story moves along and nothing is just filler. I still think Wife to Be Sacrificed which was later the same year to be a better film. Still, this is outstanding.\n\nThis is one of five films I recommend to people that want to be introduced to Roman Porno or Pink Eiga films. I highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "There was a time, about thirty years ago, when Marischka&apos;s SISSI trilogy was considered kitschy by many critics. Fortunately, these times are gone and again we all can see these beautiful films without being influenced by the critics and their politics.\n\nI must admit that Sissi has always been one of my favorite movies. Romy Schneider, her acting, gestures and her face are almost identical with real Sissi. Marischka could not make a better choice. However, I heard that this role had such an impact on Romy&apos;s life that she was associated with Sissi throughout her career. As a result, some people consider SISSI films the deepest insight into Romy&apos;s life. Hasn&apos;t she got through the terrible sorrows similarly as empress Elizabeth did?...\n\nOther cast are also very, very good. Magda Schneider, Romy&apos;s mother, gives a fine performance as Ludovika, Karlheinz Bohm (Franz Josef) does an excellent job. Vilma Degischer is particularly memorable as a cruel Sophie. Only Gustav Knuth&apos;s portrayal of Duke Max is a historical travesty. He was not so much attached to family life...\n\nAnother reason why I like these films is the fact that despite its historical inaccuracies (their love did not look like that), these movies are very gentle, show the value of love between a man and a woman and as a result, they can be watched even by small children without harm done to their psyche.\n\nSome say that Sissi is for sentimental girls and old women. This viewpoint is absolutely wrong. I am a 25 year old man and come back to these films with great pleasure and so do a lot of my friends. See it and you will not regret. Make your personal judgments, not being influenced by the unexplained criticism.",

Look this is an awful movie, everybody knows that, but the question that should be asked is is it worth watching? And the answer is HELL YES. \n\nRay Dennis Steckler lies somewhere between Ed Wood, Jr and Russ Meyer for me. Wood made laughably bad genre movies that have continued to fascinate because of their campy silliness. His movies are still tons of FUN all these years later. Russ Meyer was certainly not incompetent, but he created bizarre movies populated with strange, sex obsessed characters, who found themselves involved in twisted, often indescribable plots spouting absolutely insane dialogue. \n\nSteckler like both those directors creates his own unique world. He is closer to Wood because of his sheer ineptness I suppose, but unlike Wood&apos;s movies his are tough going at times. Truly (unintentionally) hilarious sequences are repeatedly interspersed with some of the dullest and most pointless scenes you&apos;ll ever see. That makes his movies totally unlike anyone else&apos;s before or since. &apos;Incredibly Strange Creatures...&apos; is arguably his most consistent effort, and even this one is dragged down by the endless musical numbers. Even so it is a movie that HAS to be watched at least once by any trash fiend or cult movie enthusiast. You really have to see it to believe it!"

It&apos;s rare to see something that low but there is a story behind this weak zombie film.\n\nChildren Of The Living Dead was setup to be the next great zombie film, the stars were aligned as the cast and crew was packed full of legends within the industry and the film had a modest half a million dollar budget.\n\nSadly it wasn&apos;t meant to be. Nepotism ran rampant, friends and family were brought in instead of genuine talent and were given offensively high salaries. Morale was non-existent, arguments and creative issues were a daily occurrence and the end result was a terrible film that many have publicly slammed despite their part in it.\n\nTom Savini especially has been vocal, claiming it should have been something special but descended into something he regrets.\n\nIt has a real Romero feel to it and our antagonist is actually quite good. Sadly with weak looking zombies, terrible acting/writing and a conflicted tone the film is destined to be infamous for all the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Good: \n\nTom Savini \n\nThe Bad: \n\nGunplay is laughable \n\nShoddily made \n\nTone shifts \n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nThere is nothing to fear but fear itself.....and zombies",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s really tricky to make a musical biopic interesting. Movies about singers are easy, but audiences often struggle to keep up with the life of a classical musician. Young Toscanini focuses on a brief period of time in Arturo Toscanini&apos;s life, when he was, well, young. He starts out as a cello player, and when he visits Brazil during an orchestral tour, his life changes.\n\nFranco Zeffirelli directed the film, and he certainly knows how to make a realistic period piece! Everything, from the lighting to the costumes, from the sets to the colors and textures of Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s makeup looks authentically late-1800s. I really felt immersed in the time period. The only part of the movie that wasn&apos;t realistic was the idea of Liz Taylor being an opera singer. Anyone who saw her in A Little Night Music knows that&apos;s ridiculous.\n\nBut, besides that, it&apos;s a really interesting and well-made film. It&apos;s not just a movie full of classical music. There&apos;s romance, friendship, and a moral argument. Toscanini and his sweetie-pie take a public stand against slavery, and the movie shows this without any graphic upsets for the audience.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like music at all, you probably won&apos;t like Young Toscanini, but if you are interested in this time period, or the musician himself, give it a try. I liked this movie far better than Amadeus. You might, too.",

It articulates, more clearly than I ever have, nearly every belief I hold about the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, its unyielding legacy, and its continuing negative effect on black society. It is truly the gift that keeps on giving. I have only a couple of quibbles that prevent my ten-star rating.\n\nFirst, I am offended by the inclusion of commentary from that hypocritical, self-hating windbag, Bill Cosby. Mr. Cosby continuously berates members of his own race for failing in ways that he has also failed, without attributing any blame to the curriculum of self-loathing in which black people have been indoctrinated for centuries. \n\nSecond, to routinely connect violence, drug addiction, and self-destructive behavior to the hip-hop community is just wrong-headed. Why are negative things in white culture (e.g., violence, drug use, severe tattooing and body piercing, obsession with goth and vampire cultures) overlooked—and often embraced—while hip-hop culture is held accountable for nearly all of the ills of black urban life?\n\nThis film mostly avoids the &quot;victim&quot; message, and reiterates the need for blacks to remember their history, good and bad. Jews perpetually educate their young about their history, and encourage them to never forget their own holocaust. Blacks also survived a holocaust, and we should never forget.",

Jade proves again that she is a capable and fearless action actress, but this movie contains far too much misogynistic violence for this type of thing. They basically made Jade completely overmatched by the villain from the start, and they kept her that way almost all the way through. Of course the entire Hong Kong and Mainland China police departments seem to be overmatched by this guy - apparently he and his few associates have enough guns, ammunition and explosives to start a small war, and they kill people by the dozens. Despite the few attempts at humor, &quot;Fox Hunter&quot; is a very grim and violent crime drama that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. (*1/2)",

Everyone busted a serious gut about this short. I can&apos;t say anything about it else it&apos;ll spoil it for you, but look it up.\n\nIt&apos;s All Gone Pete Tong is a story about Frankie Wilde, a DJ who hit the decks of Ibiza. For anyone who&apos;s a club/trance fan, you&apos;ll recognize a lot of familiar faces in the film: Pete Tong (of course), Carl Cox (one of my favorites), Sarah Main, Paul Van Dyk (my #1), Tiesto (he looks a lot different on screen) talking about the life of Frankie Wilde.\n\nOne of the people next to me commented that this started out like Requiem for a Dream. While its not that severe, this does have heavy drug and alcohol use. This was too much for some people in the audience and they left.\n\nBut the storyline is amazing. Give this film the time and you&apos;ll see how the director and the actors create a very simple but uplifting story about redemption and change and romance.\n\nThe soundtrack, covering everything from dance to the Beach Boys (with an appropriate track at the end) is simply to die for. The film rep said this may not have a soundtrack in the US. I hope not.\n\nIf drugs and alcohol use are not for you, I&apos;d skip this film. But if your looking for dry British humor with a ready heartily story along with terrific music, see this film and enjoy, just have some patience, its worth it.",

      "name": "A thriller which does not thrill and a comedy which fails to amuse",
      "reviewBody": "Following the success of the Bond franchise, spy films were highly popular in the sixties, and Peter O&apos;Donnell&apos;s popular comic strip &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, which featured the adventures of a glamorous female secret agent, must have seemed like a natural subject for cinematic treatment. This film was the result. The basic plot is a simple one; Modesty is recruited by British Intelligence to foil a plan by gang of jewel thieves to intercept a shipment of diamonds to a Middle Eastern sheikh. \n\nThe heroine is played by the Italian actress Monica Vitti in her first English-speaking role- something I have always regarded as an uninspired piece of casting because Vitti&apos;s spoken English was not particularly fluent, although she certainly had the looks for the part. O&apos;Donnell&apos;s Modesty was always a brunette, but Vitti mostly plays her as a blonde, although her looks, costume hairstyle and hair colour seem to change at random. Male viewers might be disappointed to note that Vitti only spends a short time dressed in the skin-tight leather catsuit which is the hallmark of the Modesty Blaise of the strip cartoon. \n\nSome spy films of the era, such as &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, took a serious look at intelligence work, but the majority aimed to emulate the relatively light-hearted tone of the Bonds. Indeed, many aimed to go even further in this direction and treated their subject-matter in a comedic way. &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; falls firmly into this category. Although the plot involves what in real life would be serious crimes, notably robbery and murder, the scriptwriter Evan Jones and the director Joseph Losey refuse to treat the story with any seriousness, instead aiming for something light, camp and at times verging on the surreal. Jones&apos;s script was, officially, based upon a story by O&apos;Donnell, but he departed from it so radically that O&apos;Donnell virtually disowned the movie. \n\nI felt that making the film in this way was a mistake. The Bond films, at their best, have always relied upon striking the right balance between tension and humour. This balance has occasionally been upset; some of the Roger Moore Bonds were too jokey and light-hearted, and the Timothy Dalton ones from the eighties tended to be too heavy-handed, but in the Sean Connery era of the sixties the film-makers generally got it right. The makers of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; get it very wrong indeed. There is no tension, and we never care about what happens to any of the characters. Moreover, &quot;comedic&quot; does not always equate to &quot;humorous&quot;; the script is supposed to be light-hearted but never produces any actual laughs. \n\nThe result is a film which is supposed to be a comedy-thriller, but which might more accurately be regarded as a thriller which does not thrill and a comedy which fails to amuse. There are some well-known stars involved, such as Terence Stamp and Dirk Bogarde, but their talents just seem wasted. It is no surprise that &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, unlike some of the Bond copycat franchises, such as the &quot;Man from UNCLE&quot; series, did not give rise to a single sequel. 3/10",

      "reviewBody": "A homely nurse is attracted to the head doctor (who she had previously dated in high school), but he is in love with Nurse Goody Two-Shoes. After getting bit by a zombie, the nurse starts to become more attractive.. but to maintain her youthful skin, she must devour human flesh. Good thing she works in a place with plenty of freshly arriving corpses.\n\nAnother reviewer says, &quot;The movie was pretty painful to watch overall and although I kept hoping it would get better, it only got worse.&quot; This sums up the problem with this film, I think. It started off actually pretty good. The overacting and soap opera antics were amusing, but these became less apparent as the film went on and the plot just unraveled. I can&apos;t even explain how, but all of a sudden it was so bland that nothing could save it.\n\nGranted, the Ukrainian guy was pretty cool. He could have used a bigger role. But that was about it. Everything else just bored me. You&apos;d like to think that after the nurse becomes &quot;hot&quot; that maybe her hotness would hold my interest. Well, no, because she wasn&apos;t hot. She had nice shoes and stockings, but she was still just as plain as ever (see movie cover).\n\nThe flesh-eating scenes were minor, the gore was decent but nothing special. The nudity was basically not even there (maybe I saw some cleavage, or something). Anything that could cover for a weak plot was absent. How many times can I watch her carve strips of flesh off a corpse? The ending was decent, but I don&apos;t know if it made up for the rest of the movie. Actually, I know it didn&apos;t. It was so non-shocking. I can&apos;t say what it is, of course, and I don&apos;t suggest you watch the film to find out. But if you must watch it, just don&apos;t hold your breath for the finale, because it&apos;s nothing clever at all. Actually, let me beg of you -- please don&apos;t watch this film.",

Saw an early preview, i had high hopes after watching the trailer but the movie didn&apos;t live up to it, short, cramped, the ending really didn&apos;t make sense.\n\nAfter See no evil they thought an action movie would do the trick but i guess or lets say i hope they should end it here. The acting was actually not so bad considering this was Cena&apos;s first movie he did a good job. But his acting alone cannot make the movie good.\n\nI&apos;d say that they should take some time, develop a good plot, pick a good director and then only move on to make a movie.\n\nReally a waste of precious time and effort though it was free! I&apos;d give it 5/10 (mainly because i sympathize with Cena who did a good job).",

      "reviewBody": "Every writer has a story. Something that brought them to who they are and what they do. Sometimes they are really cool stories, and sometimes they are not. Other times they are stories that a writer has been so affected by that they just don&apos;t talk about it all that much. Never the less it is a story and it is the backbone of what makes them writers. It tends to inform the stories they tell and how they tell it. In some ways you have to have one in order to be a writer. My experience has been that if you don&apos;t, your stories don&apos;t tend to be that interesting. They come off flat and not really worth the time to read, which is not to say that you can&apos;t find a good story to tell if you work hard enough. Writing just tends to come easier if you have a story that you really need to tell. The story flows better and emotionally connects with people reading it. At least that&apos;s been my experience given my own history as a writer.\n\nAnne Perry is a writer with a story to tell. Interestingly enough though, she seems to avoid talking about it with any great detail. You can find details if you are interested and they are put forward in the documentary about her, but it&apos;s a difficult topic to hear about. Once you do though, you can completely understand why it might be hard to say much about it. A writer internalizes most of their problems and emotions. That is why they tend to write such great stories, because what they won&apos;t say to a person, they will say in the words on the page. It can be buried under a lot of the things the stories they are telling need in order to make it interesting for the reader, but they are there if you look hard enough. For Anne Perry it seems that finding that involves reading into the opposite of what she writes about. She is searching for something deep and meaningful in her life, and many of her characters apparently reflect that reality but the reason for their search is the real prize of understand her.\n\nUltimately, writing is a long and difficult process for everyone. Even for someone who has written 40 books it takes time to make it feel and sound right for the people who might one day read it. This movie is a long and drawn out process but the pay off, for lack of a better way to describe it, is well worth the time and effort to get through it. Anne Perry - Interiors is a film worth watching for any writer who has ever felt frustrated sitting at a table staring at a blank page or computer screen. For anyone else, it&apos;s a deep inside look at where the urge to write tends to come from and will give you a deeper understanding of the life of a writer.\n\nTo check out more of my reviews, go here:\n\nhttp://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cabeza de Vaca&quot; may be viewed as a surrealistic rumination on the nature of early contact between Europeans and North American Indians, but it has very little to do with the actual narrative of events as presented to Charles V by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in his 1542 report.\n\nViewers who may wonder about the rapid transition from Florida to the Southwest in the movie should realize that the opening scene depicting the separation of the rafts of Captain Narvaez and Cabeza de Vaca took place off the coast of Louisiana WEST of the Mississippi more than a year after their first landfall in Florida, despite the meager information provided in the opening credits.  Cabeza de Vaca is also presented as Treasurer to the King of Spain, when in fact he was merely treasurer of that particular expedition.\n\nAnd although the long sequence early in the movie showing Cabeza de Vaca&apos;s period of slavery to the Indian sorcerer and the armless dwarf is quite interesting to see, there is no corresponding incident in the explorer&apos;s writings.  C de V did report on a brief period of enslavement, but that is all.  No sorcerer, no dwarf.\n\nSimilarly, the bond created between C de V and the young Indian who he cures by removing an arrowhead is not in the original narrative, but rather a conflation of several different episodes from the journey.\n\nThe key scenes of capture and near-murder by the blue-painted Indians are wholly the creation of the screenwriter.\n\nThe movie has an inconsistent approach to nudity.  Most of the Indian tribes encountered by C de V went entirely naked during the warm season, but are almost always shown with at least some kind of loincloth.  However, during the &quot;blue Indian&quot; sequence and later, when the survivors are taken in by friendly Indians for a while, full nudity is present among the females, and even full-frontal on the part of an Indian girl who offers herself to one of C de V&apos;s men.  Meant to be tittilating?  I don&apos;t know.  It wasn&apos;t.  In C de V&apos;s report, he notes a number of times that he and his Spanish companions were, for a long period, &quot;naked as the day we were born,&quot; but there is no male nudity whatsoever in the film.\n\nSo what is accurate?  The suffering endured, for sure, and the apparent success of the Spaniards in &quot;curing&quot; Indians through the power of God.  The arrival in Mexico toward the end, and the capture of the Indians there as slaves.  That&apos;s about it.\n\nNevertheless, the film holds the attention throughout, and the final scene of Indians bearing the enormous silver cross through the desert is quite arresting.\n\n6 out of 10 for me."

Then? Ta-taaaaa...the police arrive to tell the still non-sleeping members of the audience that they knew what was going on all the time. As usual.\n\nWhat is an endless fascination to me is these movies are usually starring some actors who had at one time some momentum in their careers but then fell flat. Two of these such performers are Caroll Baker in The Carpetbaggers &amp; Stephen Boyd as the baddie in The Ten Commandments who tried to slice Chuck Heston&apos;s chariot in the Coliseum. Stephen Boyd went on to bigger and better things but never made it big on a consistent basis but his career lasted much longer that Baker&apos;s, who had a kind of unbuxsome Mae West/Jean Harlowe kind of thing going on.\n\nThis film is for the videohounds only, since you never know what you are going to find.\n\nF.Y.I Never select an old movie title with two recognizable actors in it on the basis of the title since it RARELY has a connection with the film but is usually a loose translation of the original title name that is stylized to entice the American audience!",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, Columbia Pictures really shocked me with how this film began. Believe it or not, it is a sequel, of sorts, to &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;. While the main character (Robert Montgomery) is not in the film, many of the other characters are--such as his friend and agent (James Gleason) and the angel (Edward Everett Horton). However, this time they are not dealing with an accidental death and how to rectify it but with the angry Terpsichore (Rita Hayworth). Apparently, this Muse got wind of a Broadway musical down on Earth in which she and the other gods are portrayed incorrectly! She asks Mr. Jordan is she can have permission to go to New York and fix this problem. Jordan agrees and sends his befuddled angel (Horton) along as her assistant and to be sure she doesn&apos;t break any rules in fixing the play.\n\nWhile the producer does immediately fall under Terpsichore&apos;s spell and lets her re-write the play as well as star in it, there is a serious problem. The final product is just awful--sort of like a Wagnerian opera and Busby Berkeley hybrid that dumbfounded the audience--and effectively killed the show. While it was SUPPOSED to be bad, I can&apos;t see why the Columbia folks also insisted on showing so much of this bad play that was supposed to be bad! In other words, why torment the audience when they can just show tiny snippets and let us know the audience hated it--instead of making the movie audience wonder why the heck they went to see this when there was a perfectly good Clark Gable film playing down the street!! Too, too much...that&apos;s for sure! Well, despite the problems, this is only about midway through the film--so it&apos;s obvious that something will happen next. What this is and how the whole production is salvaged (if it is) is for you to see for yourself. However, it&apos;s not one of the better musicals of the era and is no where nearly as good as &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;--so you&apos;ll have to decide if it&apos;s worth it! \n\nOddly, practically everyone in this movie cannot sing--a serious problem as it&apos;s a musical!! Many of the characters were dubbed and while Rita Hayworth was gorgeous, it was silly to pick a lead who could sing (though she was a fantastic dancer). I think the reason she was used is because she was the studio chief&apos;s (Roy Cohn) pet actress--and he featured her in practically all of the studio&apos;s A-pictures during this era. I guess, in an odd way, I can understand this--but why use Larry Parks and a couple others who also couldn&apos;t sing?! \n\nAside from its very dubious views on the afterlife and theology, this is an enjoyable bit of fluff and no more--and certainly not a must-see. However, the main story idea was never good enough to have encouraged some idiots to remake it decades later as the god-awful &quot;Xanadu&quot;. Aside from some good music, &quot;Xanadu&quot; should rank as one of the dumbest major studio films of the last 40 years!",

Great cast, great look and about as much logic and charm as the old 50&apos;s detective magazines. After seeing Nick Nolte in this, I&apos;m now hoping to see him in a future Tarrantino movie. Nolte would also be a perfect fit in one of the upcoming Sin City sequels. I also have new respect for Roger Ebert, one of the few critics who enjoyed the movie for what it was meant to be. It seems to me that those who didn&apos;t like this movie, missed its point. While this isn&apos;t Academy Award material, it&apos;s a hell of a lot better than the critics would make you believe it was.",

The dialogue was smart and often very funny. The cast was very strong, especially Robert Duvall. Duvall gives an excellent performance. I have many books on movie westerns.

Now I very likely had seen this as a kid, like I did many other movies starring Bud Spencer (his not Italian name, I had no clue what nationality he was, since everything was dubbed in Germany) - many with his partner in crime Terence Hill (also not his Italian name). In this case the movie only stars Bud Spencer, but he is enough fun - no pun intended.\n\nThe movie is quite the throwback to my childhood and was a nice watch overall, but I would understand if some felt it hasn&apos;t aged too well. Not much story, a lot of shenanigans and so forth. But the charisma of Bud really elevates this to a degree that should help most to just have fun with it.",

      "reviewBody": "The Dead is a stunningly shot zombie movie with some notable differences. The most obvious is the African setting, but that&apos;s not all. The zombies themselves are haunting and macabre: many were played by locals, some of whom were amputees. They seldom make any noise but are present throughout almost all of the film, often seen in the distance wandering in somnambulistic trances without any of the over-acting that&apos;s usually associated with these films. They are understated, and scarily so. However, once they get close they are as gruesome as anything in a Romero film. \n\nAt times the feel of the film reminded me of Zombie Flesh-Eaters. Some of that was down to the edits - none of that &quot;blink and you&apos;ll miss it&quot; MTV generation editing here. This had the epic feel of late 60s and early 70s movies (think the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;). The vastness of Africa was captured wonderfully, and this only added to the typical zombie existentialist theme of there being no exit: no one ever gets out alive (or do they?)\n\nRob Freeman does a great job in the central role and there were some terrific supporting actors. The only slight gripe I had with this film was the dialogue. Mercifully there wasn&apos;t much of it, but such lines as we got to hear were rather stilted. The characters were used more as &quot;talking heads&quot; to explain things to the audience, and were always weakest when speaking. \n\nIt&apos;s hard to believe this was shot on a low budget. The directors have done a great job generating remorseless tension (another slight issue is that there is no lightness in the film - it piles tension upon tension and never lets go; it&apos;s not an easy ride). The cinematography is first rate and the soundtrack is haunting, evocative, and never obtrusive.\n\nAs a zombie movie, this is right up there with the 2005 Dawn of the Dead and the excellent Quarantine. One of the best zombie films I&apos;ve seen, and (dialogue aside) up there with the TV series, The Walking Dead."

      "reviewBody": "This has been getting a belated reputation (I admit to being totally unfamiliar with it prior to a recommendation from a Maltese friend of mine last week!) as a sort of dry-run for one of last year&apos;s most acclaimed films, BLACK SWAN. In fact, it similarly deals with a young and beautiful ballerina whose life is inextricably altered when she applies for the starring role of the famous Tchaikovsky opus &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (though here everything eventually works its way to a happy ending).\n\nWhile it does not go into the psychological avenues taken by Darren Aronofsky&apos;s recent effort, the film nonetheless plays out like a Kafkaesque thriller – with the two protagonists (the hero is a likable fellow American who happens to stay on the same floor of her Budapest hotel) sucked in by a vortex of surreal events that literally transcends the passage of time! If anything, ETOILE also recalls Hitchcock&apos;s VERTIGO (1958) in equal measures, as ageing and crippled impresario/dancer(!) Laurent Terzieff moulds leading lady Jennifer Connelly (still in her Euro-fantasy phase that had kicked off with Dario Argento&apos;s typically elaborate PHENOMENA [1984] and also comprised Jim Henson&apos;s kiddie film LABYRINTH [1986]) into a prima ballerina from a past age who had perished tragically after a performance. Interestingly, 17 year-old Connelly – though she is meant to be spell-bound and, thus, also unable to recognize the young man – slips into the intricacies of her dual role much more easily than Natalie Portman in BLACK SWAN! \n\nA dilapidated country-house also plays a central part in the &apos;re-enactment&apos; – where the male lead (whose life had until then been controlled by art-collecting uncle Charles Durning, who is himself mysteriously hypnotized at one point, gets violent towards his relative and hit by a passing car!) eventually goes to meet the evil head-on just as the Tchaikovsky ballet is being played out on stage. He has to fight with a giant black swan which, when he kills, Terzieff falls dead in mid-performance elsewhere! In the end, while hardly a lost classic, this is a reasonably interesting (and stylish) effort, regardless of the BLACK SWAN connotations which will probably be attributed to it from here on in",

All is wonderfully happy and modern but yet something just doesn&apos;t seem right.\n\nI was recommended this by another IMDb user who I have come to know as quite an intelligent young man and so I decided to go on his advice and give this film a shot.

I was glad of both this advice and also the recommendation because this film is a great idea that is really well expanded and delivered. On the face of it the film comes over like it is a short film, so simple and concise is its idea and so oddly does it deliver a simple concept, but it is a feature and the 90 minutes goes by quickly and satisfyingly.\n\nThe film is built on the feeling that there must be more to life than the safe warmth that the majority of us in the Western world are used to and it really nails it in this regard. For the majority of the film we are of course allowed to feel our main character&apos;s sense of unease and pain at the lack of passion and spark in life, but this comes in the small moments – the alternative view is not over played to make this more obvious. Instead the &quot;emotionless norm&quot; is presented in a way that is entirely recognisable; interior design and wall colours are the subjects of discussion, bland office work pays for it all – and trust me that as a man in his mid-30&apos;s, this is something I know about! It isn&apos;t overplayed though – it is normal and familiar and as a result all the more chilling as part of the film.\n\nBy making the &quot;horror&quot; so very normal and so familiar in its polite banality, the film survives the later twists when things get more extreme and weird – because we are already with it as an idea. It does always feel like a short film though because the idea never really comes to a satisfactory conclusion and those looking for a big reveal or ending will be disappointed – however those fans of short films where the &quot;idea&quot; is the thing rather than the answer will be pleased (as I was). To me the conclusion was fittingly simple because it works well with the idea as this world of the others being a happy place as long as you all go by the rules and don&apos;t be an outsider – it also kept me on board that the film made &quot;rebelling&quot; so very reasonable – Andreas was only looking for something a bit deeper, more meaningful than the colour of tiles – and again this is a &quot;rebellion&quot; that many people will be able to relate to as well.\n\nThe whole film reminded me very much of short films in terms of tone and content but also of some of the rather odd films that the Cohen brothers have made in the last 10 years where the tone is a lot of the story. I really liked the direction and composition here – the film always looks &quot;normal&quot; but by having everything so very clean and lacking in chaos or untidiness, it does contribute to the overall feeling of this world of being passionless and only &quot;happy&quot; on a very superficial level. It is all very well done and I enjoyed its relatable oddness very much – and it is this sense of the familiar that really makes it work very well and at the same time produces the cold horror of it. A really great little film in the mould of a short, very simple but also very cleverly done. Thanks Danny!"

A lot of inner, spiritual introspection. But, for me, they are very attractive and comical. Even this &quot;Diary of a Maniac&quot;, which is not one of his best films, is nice, funny, comical. The scene with the &quot;sexual interview&quot; given to the girl called Marina in the hospital is nice. The scene with the pregnant prostitute who, when asked how she is, replies that she just threw up, is also nice. The actress who plays her, Laetitia Laneri, also looks amazing, even so, a little bit pregnant. Also very funny is the scene on the bus, with the girl who had typhus when she was little, when Benito tells her that she has beautiful hair and wants to touch it. The scene with the newspaper and magazine woman seller, there with her inside the kiosk, is also very cool. Sabrina Ferilli looks great, especially she has a splendid ass.",

A teenage girl who once found out what she wants in life and strives for it no matter what: Neither circumstances, nor parents, nor other people who are trying to supposedly isolate her from problems, but in fact manipulate her, because got used to it in life. The girl does not know fear, does not waste her energy on things that she does not like and that do not suit her, in this case it is physics. In the film you can clearly see how her parents are trying to make her a physicist. Why? Because my grandmother also once wanted to make my mother a horseman. This is how family relationship patterns pass from generation to generation. The girl has lively and strong energy, she is like a fast river that cannot be grabbed, intercepted, much less changed. She lives by her own thoughts and not by the thoughts of her parents and has real fortitude, the same as every child has until her parents break her.\n\nThe relationship between the child and the horse is simply incredible. It gave me goosebumps and brought me to tears, even sobs...\n\nA very beautiful, spectacular, solemn film, containing all the ideas that are needed for motivation, development and inspiration. The actors played their roles charmingly.\n\nThe film teaches such things as how important it is to find your calling, to be brave and go through life, sweeping away all obstacles from your path, not to give up, to believe in yourself and your neighbor and go to the end.",

Li and Rosamund Kwan return, but Yuen Biao elects not to reprise his role of Foon. His replacement Max Mok does a great job in the role.\n\nMost of the wire work action is left for the climax, giving Li a chance to demonstrate just how good he is at stylish (and FAST) kung fu earlier in the movie, when he takes on a mob intent on lynching his beloved 13th aunt armed only with a fan, and faces off against Donnie Yen in a great pole fight.\n\nAs for the plot, this time us dopey westerners are the ones in danger, rather than being the outright villains. After a raid on an embassy, Wong Fei Hung decides enough is enough and takes on the White Lotus cult, who are intent on rubbing out all western influences from China. Cue high-flying kicks, punches and leaps, and a crazy fight atop a construction of tables.\n\n The climax, a memorable fight with Donnie Yen, is an absolute classic, with both giving their all. The speed and technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering, and Yen&apos;s moves with his cloth staff are gob-smacking. It&apos;s a real treat to see kung-fu cinema of this quality.",

Fischer, she is relegated to B-film standards in this run-of-the-mill cheapie. The story is hackneyed, everybody is acting at fever&apos;s pitch and even the usually cool Miss Leuwerik is over-the-top, giving the only bad performance of her short but memorable career. \n\nHannelore Elsner in one of her earliest roles is in it, too, but when you glimpse, you miss her. Shot to fame later in the decade, the talented Miss Elsner enjoyed an even bigger vogue in the late 90&apos;s as the mature First Lady of German TV."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;All Fall Down&quot; combines the best elements of &quot;Come Back Little Sheba&quot; and &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;; which should not be a total surprise given that all three come at least in part from the mind of William Inge. It is interesting that while &quot;All Fall Town&quot; is the most ambitious of the three, it is also the least known. Probably because Director John Frankenheimer made something that is more art film than box office blockbuster (or academy darling). \n\nThe storytelling technique is much like &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, both told from the point of view of the youngest member of their casts-in this case Clint (Brandon de Wilde-&quot;come back Shane&quot;). The film even goes so far as to cut in shots of Clint watching the other characters through windows and doorways, and then writing down what he has observed in a journal. This is very effective because the story has coming of age elements involving Clint and the viewer is meant to strongly identify with his character. Unfortunately Frankenheimer pulls his punch at the end and limits things to the traditional process of disillusionment found in this film genre. A much more satisfying ending was possible.\n\nI&apos;ve never shared the view that &quot;All Fall Down&quot; lacks sympathetic characters. Clint is certainly likable as is family friend Echo (Eva Marie Saint), and even father Ralph (Karl Malden) to a certain degree. Mother Annabell (Angela Lansbury) is not but her purpose is to provide some explanation for this dysfunctional family. \n\nOlder brother Berry-Berry (Warren Beatty) is not likable but is certainly interesting. Smothered by his mother he has a phobia about ending up like his parents. Which has sent him on the road where he lives by his wits and good looks. Beatty really doesn&apos;t seem to know how to play Berry-Berry and his performance is mostly a repeat of his &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; character. But the uncertainty in his performance ultimately works to his advantage, as Berry-Berry is a conflicted mess of mixed motivation. His behavior is compulsive and contradictory, a sociopath with a conscience. And he is concerned with the welfare of his little brother, who idolizes him (as do his parents). \n\nStarting out in Key West, where Clint meets his brother&apos;s ex-girlfriend (played by Frankenheimer&apos;s real life wife Evans Evans) in a strip club. In a great scene she tries to get the underage Clint to buy her a drink-but her debilitated coughing spoils any superficial sex appeal. \n\nThe action soon shifts to an older middle class neighborhood in Cleveland. Beatty appears briefly in the beginning and is mostly unseen until after the midpoint of the film. De Wille has far more screen time and introduces us to the remaining three characters.\n\nSaint&apos;s character is a spinsterish free spirit of 31 (another contradiction) who Clint falls in love with until his older brother claims her. Saint was always difficult to cast. Not earthy enough for the Julie Harris-Elizabeth Hartman type of roles and not sexy enough for the standard starlet stuff she was limited to icy librarians or dowdy girlfriend stuff until Hitchcock drew her out in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. She is physically perfect for the Echo O&apos;Brien role, someone confident and playful, yet very fragile; pretty enough to make Berry-Berry&apos;s attraction credible.\n\nThis is a slick little film but only if you like productions that could easily transfer to the stage. \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

I&apos;m willing to say genre and not pseudo-genre. Wiene, the expressionist pioneer, directs.\n\nTHE VERDICT -- A few moments of tension but mostly very talky. I thought overacted in the silent-era vein but Variety review 1932 thought well-done and unfortunate to have been released in the USA alongside Mamoulian&apos;s DR. JEKYLL &amp; MR. HYDE (1931).\n\nFREE ONLINE -- Not at this time. You may have to download. As for duration, I found 82 minutes in fair condition, which is a fast run of the 86-minute official release. There was no 104-minute release reported (so not sure why this is claimed at IMDB), only 98-minute and 91-minute &quot;test versions&quot; which appear to have been withdrawn before distribution.",

The devastation on display is quite simply jaw-dropping, with entire cities shaken to the ground, massive ships flipped around on turbulent seas like toys in a tub, and volcanoes spewing tons of lava and ash.\n\nSadly, the spectacular destruction of an entire civilisation only makes up a small percentage of the movie&apos;s massive 135 minute running time; the rest of the film consists of less than scintillating drama as a selection of characters go through predictable emotional turmoil as they face a very uncertain future (or no future at all!). All of this is pretty uninspired stuff, and matters don&apos;t get much better even as a few brave scientists devise a desperate plan to prevent their nation from completely disappearing off the face of the Earth.",

      "reviewBody": "The Twilight series specializes in teen longing, hours of vampires, were-wolves, and civilians longing for each other without much in the way of sex. That is dull viewing. But the French seem to get matters of the heart right, as in the full length film about longing, Mademoiselle Chambon.\n\nJean (Vincent Lindon) is a builder with an adorable boy and loving wife. Figuratively he has built a satisfying life, yet the opening shot is of tearing down, specifically a floor but contextually his life. Into this life comes his son&apos;s attractive teacher, Veronique Chambon, all violin playing and the sweetest disposition this side of the Virgin Mary. When he fixes her window, he also begins building a relationship hanging around the edges of adultery.\n\nThe longing comes from multiple shots with no dialogue, typically European, and specifically French, because there is an artistic joy in the languid shots. The actors express their sweet frustration with small movements of their eyes and mouths, and the camera stays with them for many seconds longer than the longest American takes.\n\nThe climax comes when Jean&apos;s pregnant wife sees Veronique play violin at his father&apos;s birthday and sees Jean&apos;s very sympathetic response. The final act has the most action, and that&apos;s not much, and not necessarily what you expected. However, it&apos;s done with the greatest subtlety as the tortured Jean makes his choices and the patient Veronique sheds just a few tears, but meaningful ones, so underplayed is her part.\n\nIt&apos;s all quiet and slow, just like most of our lives. Director Stephane Brize&apos;s love of this love affair and gentle Jean&apos;s attachment to his family is apparent from the opening sequence with the family figuring out what a &quot;direct object&quot; is to the low-key final trip to the train station.\n\nLike Citizen Kane&apos;s Bernstein longing for the girl with the parasol, Jean will probably never be the same having experienced the tyranny of lyrical love, adulterous or not: Mademoiselle Chambon."

Only set in the future, a very depressing, dangerous future that looks only too likely to be a reality, where knife crime and gangs have taken over a decaying London and it&apos;s a fight for survival that nothing short of a BNP government might have prevented.\n\nShank does little to go in any direction other than any other film aimed at the &apos;yout&apos;&apos; culture of today goes, throwing all the common street lingo, slang and style in the face of it&apos;s audience, even the title a hideous term for stabbing somebody. It tries to throw in what it thinks is the odd little inventive touch here and there, but it is little more than another sad reflection of where our young people are today and where they&apos;re going. **",

A scientific/archaeological expedition goes to deepest darkest Mexico and accidentally unleashes Hell on Earth. Old gods, revived rituals, and an awakened Queen who hungers for blood. Will humanity survive?\n\nWarning: this was shot MOS, then dubbed. The creators of the &quot;Amplified Universe&quot; wanted this movie to seem like a Mexican wrestling film from the 1950s or early 1960s. It&apos;s very disorienting, but you eventually settle into it and it&apos;s just one of the many high weirdnesses on tap.\n\nThe black-and-white cinematography, shot with consumer-grade video cameras, is strikingly good considering everything. Someone paid attention in film history class when they were talking about German Expressionism and Noir horror. (original Cat People, The Black Cat, The Seventh Victim, etc.)\n\nAll in all, give it a chance. It&apos;s difficult, but fun, and there are bits of humor pitched to horror fans that will give you a few chuckles while you follow the many bloody threads in the film.",

On Sunday afternoon, Rosseni and Elizabeth are in a boat in a grove and the girl glances at a knife and a man hunting down a woman. Rosseni believes she is giving a pretext to avoid him and does not pay attention to her. On the next morning, Rosseni learns that a teenager was murdered in the river bank in the grove and he drives to the location. Inspector Barth (Joachim Fuchsberger) goes to the school since the victim Hilda studied there and soon Rosseni becomes the prime suspect since he protects Elizabeth, who could give an alibi to him. When a second student is murdered, Elizabeth recalls that the killer where a black soutane worn by priests. While the police investigate the suspects, Elizabeth is killed and Rosseni decides also to investigate. He teams up with Herta and the find the name of the mysterious Solange Beauregard. They seek her out but what might have happened to Solange?\n\n&quot;Cosa avete fatto a Solange?&quot;, a;k;a &quot;What Have They Done to Solange?&quot; , is an intriguing giallo with a totally unpredictable story full of mystery and tension. The erotic plot is well-written with many twist and suspects. The conclusion surprises the viewer and it is worthwhile watching this film that is not dated. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O quê Vocês Fizeram com Solange?&quot; (&quot;What Have You Done to Solange?)\n\nNote; On 10 Jun 2020 I saw this film again.",

It&apos;s a worthy question, and goodness knows the movie devotes plenty of time to the issue. And if you&apos;re on the side of legacy journalism, then revel in the film&apos;s best character, David Carr (print&apos;s staunchest defender). This guy&apos;s all teeth. It&apos;s a fun scene watching him shoot down an aggregator during a debate.\n\nBut the movie&apos;s at its best when it&apos;s about the newsroom, and this is compelling stuff: decisions being made during the Wikileaks info dump, Iraq withdrawal, and the laying off o a great deal of the paper&apos;s workforce. You do get to be a fly on the wall, and during these scenes, it&apos;s good stuff.\n\n7/10",

But my fears were unfounded, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The canoing scenes are reminiscent of a lot of early travel films, and the telling of scary stories around the campfire brings back fond memories of my own grandfather.\n\nAs a grandfather now myself, who loves to relate scary stories to my young grandchildren, I absolutely love the ending scenes, and the reaction that the boys have to hearing this story from their &apos;Unca&apos; ... well worth the watch - still as enjoyable as it was almost a hundred years ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s style permeates this unjustly forgotten movie, from a different age of cinema. Oddly enough, any old film noir (or just crime-oriented) feature from its age is revered on a pedestal today, while this wonderful 20th Century-Fox big-budget effort stirs little interest.\n\nIt is a remake of a 1927 silent film of the same title, a Corinne Griffith star vehicle from First National Pictures, the distributor that later became part of Warner Brothers. It&apos;s a lost film, perhaps because a silent movie of an operetta was hopelessly dated even then. Lubitsch includes fantasy and satire here, with the play-acting performances of stars Grable and Fairbanks delightful in that they make fun of the antiquated Period Costume Film cliches, while simultaneously creating warm and empathetic characters. The elements of satire have given way in modern cinema to vulgarity, as evidenced in the work of Mel Brooks (who remade Lubtisch&apos;s hit &quot;To Be Or Not to Be&quot;) or my favorite director Ken Russell, yet Lubitsch is able to maintain the high ground even in the silliest of scenes, perhaps aided by the censorship of his day.\n\nThe Technicolor photography (by Leon Shamroy) remains stunning and just what any film buff should admire. A couple of oddities struck me as I finally saw this movie, so many decades after release, first the foot-fetish theme that instantly suggests Luis Bunuel, who was working in Hollywood during this period. And by some odd coincidence, the starting point for the movie&apos;s fantasy element is the stunning portrait of Gable as a 17th Century ancestor of her main character, which comes to life occasionally. Fairbanks&apos; infatuation with the lady in the portrait is the same starting point as Preminger&apos;s greatest movie, &quot;Laura&quot;, and Otto ended up completing &quot;Ermine&quot; after Lubitsch&apos;s sudden death at the age of 55."

She has never met her mother and always hated her as a &quot;heartless woman&quot; for giving her away as a small child. Yet Elisabeth herself seems to be a cold and unhappy woman, obviously suffering from her inability to realte to others. As Elisabeth arrives in her late motherÂ´s house, she not only finds her eccentric drunk brother Thomas (Thomas Sturm) there, but also - a little four year old girl, that appears and disappears like a ghost.\r\n\r\nElisabeth has to learn that the little girl is - or was - no one but herself thirty years ago. She begins to doubt her own perception and slowly comes to the conclusion that she must be insane, just like her late mother was (according to the locals). Even the slowly arising love affair with the shady head of the local hospital (Miguel Herz-Kestranek) cannot keep her from falling deeper and deeper into a psychological checkmate. She finally has to face her fate - and starts looking for the love she never knew...",

      "reviewBody": "Any movie that is defended with the idea that it can only be enjoyed by viewing after taking drugs... well, c&apos;mon, you know it&apos;s got to be pretty bad. And this is bad, no mistake about it. Sure, it&apos;s very colorful, and for the drug-inclined it&apos;s an eye-popping visual &quot;overdose&quot; of nostalgic psychedelia...\n\nBut at the the heart of this foolish fruity farrago is an offensive story of a geeky middle-aged man obsessing pervertedly over a pretty young woman living next door -- that obsession fueled by non-stop Peeping Tom activity. This sick invasion of privacy is treated as an excitable, joyous, comical diversion. It leads the geek professor to wild flights of fancy and lunatic dreams, giving us plenty of bizarre sequences filmed in full 60&apos;s psychedelic-meets-Richard Lester glory. But, wacky comedy-wise, it&apos;s weak tea in comparison to Lester&apos;s &apos;The Knack&apos; or &apos;Help!&apos; And considering the obvious Lester-Beatles influence (including the actor playing Birkin&apos;s boyfriend having a distinct Liverpudlian accent) it&apos;s no surprise that George Harrison provides the score.\n\nToo bad that the score is awful. Whole scenes go by with virtually no dialogue, thus a catchy pop score from Harrison would be welcome, and add to the nostalgic value of the film beyond the psychedelia. Unfortunately we get the Shankar-sauce sitar-period Harrison. Only those finding a nostalgic trip from Indian music that sounds like the wailing of out-of-tune violins (or worse, the sound of a cat trapped inside bagpipes) will be pleased. Otherwise, it&apos;s an ear-offending slog.\n\nAnd otherwise, filmically, you get a frantic but professional performance from Jack Macgowran, a lot of eye-catching shots of pretty cult-figure Jane Birkin, and a few comic bits that work."

      "reviewBody": "My god, this film is a piece of work. Rough as a bag of spanners. One of the ugliest and sleaziest giallos you could ever hope to see. Plot wise there is very little to say, the impact in this film comes from its audacious insistence on making everything look as unpleasant as possible.\n\nBut let me give you a quick plat re-cap. Two dead bodies are found at the edge of a canal in Venice. The police start asking friends of the late couple for clues, but as soon as they start their investigations, more dead bodies start piling up. What is the connection, and out of all the unsavoury characters that appear on the screen, does any of them have a clear alibi (or conscience)?\n\nEnough of that then, what is really so bad about Giallo A Venezia? Well it&apos;s just that the sleaze factor is so high it&apos;s off the scale. The dead couple are at the centre of the plot, and the film consists of many flashbacks in which we see how the husband took pleasure in humiliating and sexually abusing his timid wife. The poor actress who plays Flavia (the wife) suffers the indignity of being stripped naked and roughed up in nearly every scene she appears...I hope she got paid well. Worse still, her husband Fabio is not blessed looks-wise, and add this to the fact that the sex scenes between the pair of them are completely devoid of chemistry makes watching them a real chore  and they go on for AGES!! You&apos;ll see a lot of Flavia naked which might have looked nicer if things were better filmed but the whole thing is done so sloppily that a lot of the time it&apos;s just not that exciting. Especially when Fabio is slobbering all over her (he&apos;s a really terrible kisser!) and trying to roll all over the place without showing his private bits, whereas of course there&apos;s no modesty allowed for his wife who is shown very graphically naked in several scenes.\n\nThe reason why I have had to devote a full paragraph to describing the sex scenes is because that&apos;s really all that happens for 75% of the films running time! Other than that, we have to sit through the police force carrying out their investigations which is kinda boring, even with the running gag of the main inspector eating hard boiled eggs in every scene (why? who knows... It must be an Italian thing), and some half hearted attempts by director Mario Landi to spin a web of mystery around the proceedings.\n\nSo that just leaves ...the murders. And just as he manages to make all the sex scenes ugly, unpleasant and graphic, Landi cuts no corners with the violence either. So prepare yourself for some very grim scenes of violence. Although the scenes are not dwelled on in loving detail like they are in a Lucio Fulci gore flick, they all seem to have a very nasty flavour to them. Scissor stabbings to the crotch and a human torch are two that spring to mind. Oh wait, did I say the gore is not dwelled on? Sorry I forgot the film&apos;s gore &quot;highlight&apos; in which victim has their leg sawed off while tied to the kitchen table. I have seen a lot of graphic gore but I found this intensely unpleasant. I think it&apos;s because it&apos;s just all sort of...thrown at you. No artistry to speak of, just events.\n\nThis film has absolutely no class whatsoever. And if you get a kick out of sleaze, it&apos;s almost possible to appreciate it on that level alone, but anyone with any taste in good cinema is likely to be left shaking their head in disbelief. Very hard to find - at time of writing there is no DVD or VHS release in print, so you&apos;re stuck with finding bootlegs if you want to track this down, and even then I believe it was originally released in Italian only  so make sure you get a subtitled copy if you must seek this out! A bleak, bizarre and depressing piece of grime, it&apos;s very hard to be positive about this movie. Even calling it a giallo is an insult to that genre, as the &quot;whodunnit&quot; value is very weak. Its just 90 minutes of bad simulated sex and some equally badly simulated murders, but if the phrase &quot;in your face&quot; was ever deserved, it is here.",

      "reviewBody": "A somewhat schematic script - you can almost see the boxes being ticked as each issue is dealt with - does not ultimately detract from a fine achievement. The story surrounds the succumbing to HIV-AIDS by a life-loving young man at the time when the world was taken by surprise by the ferocity of the hitherto-unknown virus. The various reactions - bewilderment, fear, panic, hatred, self-loathing, guilt, determination, courage, loss, grief and, of course, love - are all charted in the five central characters.\n\nThere can be little argument, I&apos;d have thought, concerning the excellence of Michel Blanc&apos;s performance; nor of the puzzling awfulness of Lorenzo Balducci&apos;s - whyever was this Italian actor cast as an American who had been brought up in Australia? \n\nJulie Depardieu&apos;s character is the least developed of the central quintet but nevertheless the actress manages, as ever, to make a fully-rounded contribution.\n\nEmanuelle Beart&apos;s striking features and dynamic screen presence make it difficult to assess her as an actress. In the end she didn&apos;t convince me she was any kind of writer, but she was entirely convincing as a mother with ambivalence to her baby. The scene where her character talks to her own mother (the late Maia Simon, in a brief but noteworthy final performance) about the difficulties surrounding her own birth is one of the most tender in the film.\n\nJohan Libéreau is touching as the doomed Manu, fleshing out what seems to me to be a somewhat idealised character - unreflective but sensitive, foolhardy yet vulnerable.\n\nBut the film ultimately belongs to Sami Bouajila as the policeman who finds himself in the most unexpected of relationships. It&apos;s by far the most complex role and also, perhaps for that very reason, the most believable. Bouajila embraces the contradictions, possibly realising, as Heath Ledger proved so memorably in Brokeback Mountain, that struggles with sexuality can produce compelling drama.\n\nLes Temoins is well edited, photographed and, on the whole, well directed. The influence of Truffaut&apos;s Jules Et Jim is all-pervading, but it&apos;s none the worse for that. The film&apos;s biggest advantage is that it tackles its subject in an entirely unsentimental way: the same script made in Hollywood would undoubtedly turn into something unspeakably gooey - the memory of Philadelphia, with which it could all too easily be compared, makes me shudder. Les Temoins is way, way above that.",

She then leads them to a man named &quot;Morioka Fuyuto&quot; (Ken Takahura) who is talking on the phone on a nearby sidewalk. Although Morioka is totally baffled by it all, as might be expected, both he and his accuser are subsequently taken to the police station to clarify the situation. While there, another man also comes in and identifies Morioka as having robbed him that same night as well. To make matters even worse, when they search his apartment they even find the stolen merchandise. So, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, he escapes at the first opportunity with his main priority being to clear his name--regardless of what it takes. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, although this was an entertaining film for the most part, there were several rather implausible scenes thrown in which strained the overall credibility of the story. Likewise, it probably ran a bit too long as well. Even so, it was certainly worth the time spent and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

Basically... at least 90% identically, no questions asked! Anyone remembers Timber Falls? Come on really, what was the point of this one? It is not better made, doesn&apos;t have more thrills, has the same location but it does manage to bring a whole lot more plot holes! Easy to anticipate, boring and annoying!\n\nSo, if you haven&apos;t seen Timber Falls and you are just dying to get a look at this one instead, here is one good reason why not to do it: BECAUSE &quot;TIMBER FALLS&quot; IS ACTUALLY GOOD!\n\nIt really is quite shameful, almost a shot-by-shot copy this Rogue River, i mean really, can&apos;t they at least pretend to think of an original story? Or maybe take one that is already out there, but bend it a little, add something to it, not make a &quot;little baby sister that COULDN&apos;T&quot;!\n\nTherefore, my advice, if you want to see a horror and you find Rogue River&apos;s story interesting, make one giant step and take on Timber Falls instead. You will thank me later, trust me! Enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "A movie like this has to be judged fairly - and that means being judged by the standards of its era. It tackles a subject that in 1938 would have been taboo to pretty much everyone - the scourge of syphilis, and the associated sexual &quot;looseness&quot; that was seen as its cause. Yes, I know that this is considered an &quot;exploitation&quot; film - one dressed up as an educational film in order to get past censors who would have objected to some of the sexual innuendo contained within it. Still, there is no doubt that at one time syphilis was a major health issue, and so this also comes across as something of a &quot;scare tactic&quot; - a way of warning people to avoid sexual immorality lest they contract the terrible disease. Thus, the words &quot;they must be told!&quot; in the opening credits. The first 20-30 minutes or so jump around a little bit. We see a fair bit of a burlesque show attended by a lot of people, some hints of lesbianism as one girl tries to convince another to spend the night with her, &quot;wild&quot; house parties with couples going off together and assorted shots of those wanting to do battle with the disease and the loose morals at the root of it. It then settles down largely to the story of Millicent - a small town girl who went to New York and caught the disease, then returns home and spreads it to her new husband and their child. The tragic results of the disease are portrayed, and the movie then tries to end on a hopeful note.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a particularly good movie. It drags at times, but I thought the subject matter was worthwhile, and looked at from the perspective of 1938 it was courageous. One can only go so far with courage alone, though. Eventually, you have to judge whether a movie has quality or not. This one fails on that count.",

      "reviewBody": "In the mid Fifties, Famous Monsters of Filmland published photos and stories about early horror and sci-fi serials. The Lost City serial was reviewed by Forrest Ackerman, FM&apos;s publisher, in which he told a story about the serial being run on early television in New York City. This was at a time when the networks were using old movies to fill up daytime schedules. As the story goes, the kids were so frightened at seeing black natives being turned into giant zombies with wide-eyed expressions and menacing grins, that protests were made to the station running the serial. The station discontinued the serial viewings. This story found its way into a couple of movie reference books. A serial historian checked out the story and found no mention anywhere that it either ran or was discontinued due to criticism. The serial has become a classic among fans because of its outdated racism and because it featured George Hayes, who became &quot;Gabby Hayes&quot; in Roy Rogers westerns. It also featured familiar B actors Kane Richmond, Claudia Dell and William &quot;Stage&quot; Boyd. Boyd was a B actor whose infamous claim to fame was that he once arrested for having illegal liquor at a party in his house during Prohibition. When the story was published in the paper, a photo of another William Boyd, whose stardom was on the rise. The studio where Boyd was working released him on the morals clause, even though he was not guilty. It may have been at this time that the William Boyd who was arrested took the name &quot;Stage&quot; to differentiate from the other Boyd. In any case, the innocent Boyd toiled in the B picture sweatshops until he was cast in a A western as Hopalong Cassidy."

The stars and director were in attendance as well as Ian Hamilton and Alan Stuart themselves.\n\nI enjoyed this film very much. It&apos;s got humour and heart and characters that you can really get behind. You really want to see them succeed. It&apos;s also hard not to feel a swell of patriotism come the end -if you&apos;re a Scot. Otherwise you&apos;ll still get a warm feeling inside The cast are likable and their performances are good - although Charlie Cox and Kate Mara&apos;s accents weren&apos;t entirely convincing they both put in winning performances. The supporting cast are also good value with Stephen McCole making a very personable member of the team. Billy Boyd and Robert Carlyle do well with slightly limited roles.\n\nThere are a few niggles - like the aforementioned accents - and some suspiciously green looking trees given that its set in winter, but these are minor. I can see this doing very well when it is put on general release, and that success will be deserved.",

But every single thing contradicts laws of nature so bluntly that it is just impossible to take it seriously.\n\nThe struggle between characters portrayed by Van Damme and Adkins is well shown. And you can even sympathize both to great extent. But every single bit of lighting and makeup will turn it to comics. And already sitting with a silly grin at your face you just can not take it seriously.\n\nThis is very good trash movie! And I really mean it! If you like to watch one do go for this.

      "reviewBody": "After seeing Agnes Bruckner&apos;s memorable performance in &quot;Rick&quot; (a modern re-imagining of the opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot;), I had to see what else she has starred in. Even better was her performance in this film &quot;Blue Car&quot;, a coming-of-age film that boldly crosses boundaries that mainstream Hollywood wouldn&apos;t dare touch.\n\nI&apos;m not just talking about the scandalous older guy &amp; young girl theme which has been done before (&quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Lolita&quot;, and almost every Woody Allen movie ever made), but in particular I&apos;m referring to disturbing issues teenagers and kids face today: self-harm, self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts. Don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s nothing explicit. But the fact that these issues are even presented sets this movie on a different level.\n\nOther rare &amp; unheard-of films that touch on these modern teen problems are &quot;Archie&apos;s Final Project&quot; (about a high school kid who decides to videotape his last days before killing himself), &quot;Angela&quot; (about 2 young sisters who create a fantasy world of angels &amp; demons to cope with their real life traumas), and the very dark &amp; very creepy &quot;Tideland&quot; about a young girl who creates a nightmarish world around her to try to protect her corroding innocence.. &quot;Blue Car&quot; fits right in there, probably the tamest of the bunch but not without its own hard-hitting moments. I think it would be appreciated by most mid-to-late teenagers whose minds are asking deep questions about life. I&apos;m way past that age, but I still found it compelling and impressive all around. An excellent starring debut by Agnes Bruckner as well as directorial debut from Karen Moncrieff.",

      "name": "Excellent sex, but short-shrift on the gambling",
      "reviewBody": "With the title CASINO, NO LIMIT, one would expect some attention to the gambling details, perhaps even a suspenseful war of wills across the table. Instead we get high-quality Euro Sex, over 2-1/2 hours worth, but the video-makers decided to punt on the game of chance content.\n\nThat&apos;s a shame, because otherwise this is a glamorous, gal-filled porn video from Marc Dorcel, boasting &quot;14 girls, 12 scenes&quot;. I guess the amount of thought and care to completing the entertainment package was just beyond the abilities of writer-director Herve Bodilis.\n\nFlashbacks provide the back story as Dorcel regular Horst Baron portrays Horst (entire cast use the same names for their characters too), a war criminal seen torturing and then executing a hapless guy in opening scenes. Melissa Lauren (buxom French actress well-known from hundreds of U.S. made XXX videos) wants revenge, and schemes along with wheelchair bound Alex (as Alex, natch) to get some. Alex wants revenge against Nacho (Nacho Vidal, an excellent villain and no slouch in the humping department), the guy who put him in a chair three years back.\n\nYasmine is Alex&apos;s main squeeze and a key cog in the revenge plot -she&apos;s an amazing beauty who generally earns her top (or near the top) billing in a Dorcel exercise. Other key player is Tony (Tony Carerra), a gangster living very high on the hog in Ibiza, who is quite colorful, boasting plenty of tattoos and having a cute pug as mascot. He&apos;s certainly the least hissable of the villains.\n\nOne peculiarity of this video is that all the major female roles are played by brunettes (most of them outfitted with extremely fake looking wigs seeming to be auditioning for a Vampira role), while the attractive blondes, with the exception of Natali DiAngelo, are just on hand as eye candy and sex filler, with zero dialog. Given the huge cast list I found this pecking order fascinating and peculiar, though it is true that in mainstream cinema it&apos;s the brunettes (Roberts, Swank, Bullock, Portman, etc.) who bring home the bacon, with superstar longevity far exceeding that achieved by their blonde sisters (take Pfeiffer or even Lange for example, in hindsight view).\n\nThe one token &quot;redhead&quot; in the cast is Ana Martin, merely wearing a bright red wig that looks like it was sent over from Ricky&apos;s moments before the shoot. Her scene is near the finish, a very, very strange contest of Melissa arm wrestling Ana while various thugs molest them from behind as a distraction. Such irrelevant kinkiness is what puts Euro Trash porn on a pedestal, or into the gutter, depending upon one&apos;s point-of-view. Dorcel is on a safe sex kick (every video has a couple of PSA&apos;s included stressing condom use), so even in this life &amp; death world, every villain and third-rate henchman remembers to put on a rubber before raping or just routinely penetrating the 14, count &apos;em, 14 women in the cast.\n\nWith Lauren and Yasmine leading the way, the sex scenes are strong and plentiful, which will obviously endear CASINO to the undiscriminating porn fan. One rather &quot;violent sex&quot; scene where nasty Nacho forces Lauren to gaggingly deep throat him is quite impressive, and works well in the narrative since we know she already hates his guts enough to want to kill him.\n\nSo why do I complain about the gambling? Early scenes show the cast playing roulette, blackjack and poker at a casino frequented by Horst and his evil-looking secretary Nina (Nina Roberts), but the plot builds up to an illegal &quot;No Limits&quot; game staged by Tony in which not only does each of the four contestants put up a million euros each for starters, but when cleaned out, you are permitted to literally bet your life.\n\nThe game they&apos;re playing appears to be a modified version of the currently trendy Texas Hold&apos;em, but Bodilis&apos; direction of the poker action is so sloppy you never know what&apos;s going on, and there&apos;s no suspense whatsoever before some guy announces, say &quot;Two Jacks&quot; (what&apos;s in his own concealed hand, not the total five card combination which counts) and is pronounced the loser. Why not show the cast sweating out each card, betting before and after the River, rather than truncating all the gambling scenes to the point of irrelevancy? This is Filmmaking 101 (or video-making I guess), but perhaps pornographers have reinvented the wheel to their own stupid &quot;sex is all&quot; agenda."

      "reviewBody": "This little film from Spain written by Piti Español and director/writer Eduard Cortés is currently in the On Demand section on television and hopefully Amazon will offer the version of the DVD that can be played on USA/Canada soon. Known also as WINNING STREAK it is a true story and the film is an exhilarating heist movie that tells the true story of a family who discovered the way to legally win at roulette. They were known as THE PELAYOS and they won hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos around the world with an infallible method based on the roulette wheel&apos;s imperfection, their lifestyle is about to become better than their wildest dreams, as they set out to break the banks at casinos around the world. \n\nGonzalo Pelayo (Lluís Homar) is old but has a dream – to break the bank of casinos and become famous. He comes up with a way to chose number to win at the roulette wheel and convinces his son Iván (Daniel Brühl – is there a language this German actor has not mastered?) to gather a &apos;family&apos; to bring off his dream. Iván gathers fishmonger Balón (Vicente Romero) and his strange cousins Marcos (Oriol Villa) and Alfredo (Miguel Ángel Silvestre) and together they manage to decipher a legal way to win. Thanks to their simple—, and more importantly, legal— method, the Pelayos were able to win hundreds of thousands of dollars at roulette tables around the world. They broke the banks at casinos across five continents; Amsterdam, Las Vegas, Australia, Paris, Madrid, Macao. Their incredible achievements became legendary, and not only in the casino world. As well as breaking the bank, their legend broke through borders, and they were soon famous the world over. THE PELAYOS is a film full of adventure which shows how ingenuity can transform &apos;insignificant&apos; people into people capable of bringing down powerful companies. It is a film about lust for life, about taking on the world when you&apos;re 20 years old. It&apos;s the story of a group of people who find a more fun and exciting way to earn a living than they ever thought possible. They have their goal within their reach and surmounting the challenge will allow them.\n\nThere are love interests - Iván is a singer and falls for another singer Shui (Hui Chi Chiu) who also happens to his father&apos;s mistress, Alfredo falls for a croupier whom endangers because she works for the casino&apos;s manager, etc – and conflicts with the authorities but by and large this is a fast paced feisty entertainment with a bouncy cast to carry it off. \n\nGrady Harp"

      "reviewBody": "The Good Book is one of the most enjoyable shot on video flicks I have ever encountered. It has a solid premise: in the future, people exist solely around the Internet. To venture outside would risk the possibility of becoming a solar enhanced mutant. To up the ante, however, an even more brilliant plot twist is thrown into the plot.\n\nComputer repairman Joseph Cyrus (Brian Campbell) must hazard the outside world to keep the internet coming to customers who are as entranced as the flesh clutching zombies Cyrus must ward off. Cyrus, who had created a virus that was capable of decimating the Internet, is under the watchful eyes of the authorities. One gathers his dangerous labor as almost penance for his past sins. A God like being begins to appear to Cyrus (played by co-scripter, Barry Gerdsen).\n\nHe wants Cyrus to resurrect the dread virus and destroy the Internet. Cyrus becomes a hunted man as word spreads and shadowy soldiers hunt him in the night. This flick has some of the best action sequences for a shot on video film. Cyrus flees through a fog-riddled forest as flashlights arc through the tree limbs. It is an epic scene and to capture it so convincingly on video is a notable triumph.\n\nWhen Cyrus and the `God&apos; square off for the final confrontation, some very incredible f/x come into play (courtesy of special effects man, Fred Kraemer). The bottom line is: this is a very refreshing film that will have you gasping for air on more than one occasion.\n\nWhile the acting is not the best you&apos;ll ever see, there are some very convincing moments. Some of the smaller scenes would have benefited by a little more discipline on director Giaquinto&apos;s part, but do not effect the big picture. The sets are appropriately dismal and shot in a gloomy nightfall. Giaquinto rises above the limits of the shot on video flick to deliver a mini indie classic that will be talked about by fans for years.",

Poor cinematography means half the time you have no clue whats going on. Many of the shots are just to dark to be able to see around the characters leading to confusion as to what exactly is going on. The ending is also half done. It was like the writers just shoved it in there as an extra with no thought.\n\nIts sad because its well acted and has some good startle scares unfortunately most of these are in the trailer.\n\nWait for the DVD,",

      "reviewBody": "This movie, being the last of the Gamera saga, is the best of the bunch. Not only are the effects top-notch, (particularly the scenes in which Gamera and Gaos birds are fighting over the city with no particular regard to human life), but the story of loss and vengeance with a young girl tied to one the first movies in the series brings a more darker theme to the genre. It&apos;s not necessarily required to watch all of the movies to catch up, but it couldn&apos;t hurt. The newer design for Gamera is the best design for him yet. He should have always been this way, however, since his appearance has changed in all three movies, they never explain how or why that is. I gather that they expect us to believe that he has always looked that way, especially since a flashback scene from the first Gamera movie features his new design instead of the one he had for the movie. The ending is a very clever touch to have fans gasping for more. If you&apos;re a giant kaiju fan this movie i would highly recommend."

The supposed evolution of the characters also has no basis, at the end of the movie they&apos;ve changed because that&apos;s what the ending warrants not because anything happened that would back it up.\n\nSome jokes do work, because out of 400 some will work, even if most are just embarrassing. Maybe children will find some enjoyment here but for an adult it&apos;s a penitence to have to sit through this.\n\nThe writers should also be ashamed of making jokes at the expense of homeless people, non-normative bodies, asians and children with nervous tics. The 80s were a long time ago.\n\nNever watching another Santiago Segura movie, not even in the outdoor summer cineam.",

However, if you take into account for what this is (a ridiculous low budget C grade horror flick), you should get some enjoyment out of this. A mad scientist experiment goes awry when a bunch of Frankenstein like creatures and everyone in the room get transported back in time to The Civil War. Army Of Frankenstein&apos;s is campy, gory and action packed cheesy fun that plays it loose with history. The acting is not great, but if it was I would have probably enjoyed it less. For a movie like this, to be entertained is all you can ask for. Some movies fail to do that. If you don&apos;t believe me, try watching Trump Vs The Illuminati. Let me know how that works out for you.",

One by one is killed by a Shaman, who has been threatening the area for fifteen years. \n\n&quot;Body Count&quot; is another B-movie sub-product of &quot;Friday 13th&quot;, full of naked women and having non-original deaths. Even the soundtrack, when the killer is arriving, recalls the one of Jason. Its greatest attraction is the name of the cult Italian director Ruggero Deodato. However, it is a cheesy and slasher movie, with a silly screenplay, some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, and recommended for fans of this director only. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Contagem de Cadáveres&quot; (&quot;Body Count&quot;)\n\nObs: On 22 June 2008, I saw this movie again.",

The spoofs of old, like Airplane and The Naked Gun have given way to the worst of the worst, and this movie is so bad I do not even have a word for it. I assume this movie is like going through drug withdrawals because I was in the floor in brutal pain and agony. I made it to the end without croaking, but it was close.

      "reviewBody": "John Wayne stars as Ted Hayden in this one, lithe young companion of grizzled old George &apos;Gabby&apos; Hayes, who was just starting to develop into the character now so familiar to Hopalong Cassidy fans. Ted is an orphan, left for dead by the varmints who done fer his paw, and saved from beneath his father&apos;s dead body by Hayes&apos; Dusty Rhodes. All this  and much more  is related to the viewer in the opening scene, a conversation between the pair that is nothing but a huge chunk of exposition that is as lacking in subtlety as it is replete with information. Hayden has returned to his hometown to catch the man with the mad laugh who killed his father, and poses as Gat Ganns, all-round bad egg, who bears more than a passing physical resemblance to our hero.\n\nThis is a fairly acceptable entry in John Wayne&apos;s Lone Star series of films made in the early to mid-thirties. There is quite a diverting storyline, even though the acting is as creaky as usual for these flicks. It&apos;s the stunts that stand out in all of the low budget efforts Wayne made in those days, and their success is thanks to stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt. You get the impression as you watch that some real hair-raising risks were taken to capture these scenes  and you sometimes wonder whether it was worth it considering the poor quality of most other aspects of the films. Watch out for Canutt standing in for bad guy Lloyd Whitlock, who sports a full head of greying hair, in the fight with Wayne near the end of the film. Canutt had dark hair and a noticeable bald patch, but hack director R. N. Bradbury obviously didn&apos;t believe in going to the expense of making even a perfunctory effort to disguise the actors&apos; physical differences. Oddly enough, it&apos;s this kind of lack of attention to detail that make the Lone Star films so curiously endearing.",

      "reviewBody": "Unjustly forgotten (no comments at all in IMDb), GOHA is a beautifully made French film, shot in Tunisia by late, great French filmmaker Jacques Baratier. It&apos;s long overdue for a first-class video revival.\n\nVery early in his career Omar Sharif takes the title role, a layabout who all the townsfolk know by his faithful companion, a donkey. Movie is presented as a &quot;tragic love story&quot; as part of oral history, as everyone crowds around to listen to the storyteller recount Goha&apos;s fate.\n\nGoha&apos;s donkey strays into the daily caravan of learned men heading for the university, and everyone is surprised at the &quot;donkey who went to school&quot;. This begins Goha&apos;s saga, as he is taken under the wing of a great scholar and local major domo Tal-el-Ouloum (Lauro Gazzolo), but gets into deep trouble when he falls in love with the beautiful young betrothed Fulia of his elder.\n\nPicture is brimming with foreign folkways and culture, gently told but with some punch, as when Goha becomes a pariah after his crossing the line romance is revealed. The tragic ending is presented in a wistful fashion that I found quite moving.\n\nAlready showing the magnetism and combination of naturalism/theatricality that won him the career-making role in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA several years later, Sharif is a spellbinding presence, especially fascinating to watch now that we&apos;ve seen him in scores of other roles. Daniel Emilfork, the talisman actor of many a great horror movie, is perfectly cast as the blind oracle-figure, who is Goha&apos;s chief companion next to the donkey.\n\nThe donkey is not overly anthropomorphised, but a principal character nonetheless. Zina Bouzaiade is a beautiful love interest as Fulia, while her sister is played by Claudia Cardinale, already striking as a teenager starting her classic (and essential) movie career -she would be blessed to participate in many of the most enduring European classics in the decades to come.\n\nCamera-work by Jean Bourgoin is exemplary, and provides an early apprentice assignment for Andreas Winding, who would become my favorite French d.p. until his untimely death in 1977.\n\nBaratier was an avant garde director, best known for classics DESORDRE (a short featuring a who&apos;s who of &apos;40s French cultural figures) and LA POUPEE. I always thought he was under-appreciated, as his film SWEET AND SOUR, once a staple in the revival houses, is the epitome of the Nouvelle Vague; in fact one of his later films PIEGE has been on my Want to See list for 4 decades now. Hopefully the buffs outside France will seek out his work."

      "reviewBody": "Aside from the fact that this was made at the height of the Third Reich - so it&apos;s underlying politic of the might of the German people and it&apos;s heroes it to be assumed, this is a rather dry and unremarkably sterile depiction of the eponymous statesman who worked with Wilhelm I of Prussia (Friedrich Kayßler) to create the German Imperial state. It tries to pack far too much over-simplified history into two hours and the portrayal of Bismarck himself by an underwhelming Paul Hartmann leaves us amidst a story of turbulent history told as if it were a child&apos;s &quot;Janet and John&quot; book. The complexities of the relationships between the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian empire, Russians, French and British are all rather overlooked and certainly undercooked as we spend much of the film in audience chambers watching a vacillating king or in a prevaricating parliament where nothing seems to count for very much - until our hero arrives to convince and save the day. It&apos;s almost entirely confined to a sound-stage so what few opportunities offered us to experience the military tactics of Moltke against the Danes or the Austrians are largely confined to a map or to the inside of a tent. The ending justifies the dramatic means - and we know that there was a unified German Empire born in 1871. It&apos;s a watchable enough historical biopic, but no effort is made to develop the characters and the story is about as dry and processional as it can be. It&apos;s hard to imagine this as a successful piece of jingoism, to be honest. It&apos;s completely forgettable.",

      "reviewBody": "It is generally believed that unrequited love is classified as impossible love. This is not entirely true as impossible love is more related to a kind of love wherein lovers try to possess something that is impracticable. This is why most instances of impossible love are similar to most incidents of unattainable love.&quot;The lady with the dog&quot;- one of the most tender classics of Russian cinema is a film which deals with the theme of impossible love. This Iosif Heifits film describes the tragic tale of Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna who met and fell in love with each other while vacationing at Yalta, Russia. It is based on a famous short story by Anton Chekov which also takes into account the realization of the worthlessness of one&apos;s existence in an extremely dull milieu. Gurov is an integral part of this milieu which he hates with all his might. The film remains faithful to the spirit of the book as it has added rich, visual touches to the narrative which takes into account a highly puritanical Russian society where divorce had not yet made its appearance. The beauty of this film lies in the fact that both writer Anton Chekov and director Iosif Heifits emerge as true chroniclers of male-female relationships as they emphatically convey that whenever a man makes the first amorous move, a woman accepts it only when she is truly interested in getting herself involved in a love affair. Lastly, we all know that love is not a child&apos;s play and can bring trouble as the viewers watch with astonishment how Anna Sergeyevna express incessantly all unease which she feels whenever she is made conscious of her love affair.",

It had to happen, but it wouldn&apos;t happen overnight, and not without serious new problems. The &quot;back of the bus&quot; rule was no longer acceptable to some citizens. This is a serious and insightful look at two fictional women, existing at opposite ends of the Montgomery social structure, who, while having accepted their current relationship, find themselves hesitant participants in the &quot;larger&quot; world. &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot; brings history back to life in reasonable and wonderfully detailed way. The acting is strong, dialog good, the sets and costuming some of the most thorough I&apos;ve ever seen. Women have to take off their clip earring before speaking on the telephone. They leave lipstick on the edge of their Russel Wright coffee cup. Children stand in fear of adults doing things they don&apos;t understand, and often do NOT get explanations. THEY learn from behaviors."

MOTHER is a lengthy mystery film featuring an unusual storyline about a mother who seeks justice for her unfairly imprisoned son. Along the way, there&apos;s all the kind of bizarre supporting characters, atypical incident and genuinely surprising plot twists that you&apos;d expect from a Korean film. This is a movie that keeps you watching throughout despite the slow pacing and lack of action.\n\nThe character development is excellent: fully natural, low key throughout, and thoroughly involving. Unsurprisingly, the actors selected to pay the various characters are just right for the part, particularly Hye-ja Kim who we only ever know as &apos;mother&apos;. She&apos;s a unique choice of lead and fits the role perfectly. Won Bin, who made an excellent action hero in THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, is equally excellent here as the slow-witted son and he really gets his teeth into the part.\n\nMOTHER may be a slow burner of a film, but it has a subtle way of truly involving the viewer in the storyline. The tension builds as the climax nears, and then the movie hits you with some moments of quiet devastation that prove a shock to the core. Fans expecting another pulse-pounding thriller like THE YELLOW SEA may be disappointed, but those with open minds will have a ball.",

      "reviewBody": "Wisecracking Chicago cops Ray and Danny tackle drug lord Julio Gonzales in a battle of wits across the city. Essentially the plot doesn&apos;t matter, this is just another buddy cop movie from the eighties. However it rises above others by being good fun throughout. It even takes a break from the action midway for the two to go and live on the beach and lay low for a while.\n\nThe main reason it is so much fun is the chemistry between Hines and Crystal. It&apos;s very easy to believe that they are partners of many years. Crystal is especially funny but really they both make it good. Even chase scenes and action scenes contain witty dialogue throughout. Smits is not a great villain but he carries the role well and the supporting cast are impressive with other future big names Dan Hedaya and Joe Pantoliano.\n\nOverall it&apos;s not a classic - it&apos;s a buddy cop movie. But even now it still feels fresh and fun due to the partnership of Hines and Crystal. Watch it, like the characters, enjoy the action and laugh at the comedy - a wonderful example of how the buddy cop genre can be good when everything is just right."

      "reviewBody": "Love and the spiritual (i.e. inner) life have rarely been better portrayed! Graham Greene&apos;s novel has been translated to cinematic imagery with an almost religious devotion.  It isn&apos;t easy to make profound and meaningful experience so immediate and felt as this film does.  Watching it on video...a second viewing...I was even more deeply moved than the first time around.\n\nJulianne Moore, very much on the big screen these days (and for good reason), gives another of her splendid performances, this time as Sarah Miles, a middle-class English woman, married to a good, but dull man who takes her for granted.  Her encounter with Maurice Bendrix (played to a T by the consummate actor, Ralph Fiennes) is electric and sets in motion an affair of deep consequence...for all three people involved.  Stephan Rea as Henry Miles, Sarah&apos;s husband, trapped in his desire, but inability to fulfill the emotional and sexual needs of his much-loved wife, is another convincing and touching portrayal.\n\nThe spiritual aspects expressed in the film, reflect the life-long struggle of Grahame between his Catholicism and his doubts.  The deep pulls of each character toward both personal and impersonal love give the film a dimension and an honesty that reward the &quot;participant&quot; (for that&apos;s how potent the film is) with an indelible human experience.\n\nTo Neil Jordan, the director, my wholehearted gratitude for his sensitive, nuanced presentation of this beautiful film.",

I really enjoy most of the Happy Madison films, but this one was a complete bummer! I love Jonah Hill and Steve Zahn is just as good. Not to mention the cast of characters that usually appear in these films, specifically Allen Covert of Grandma&apos;s Boy. I really loved that movie, so I then put faith that this one would be somewhat comparable, but quite the contrary. I mean there was some funny and sometimes hilarious parts, but it was just a stretch. They tried way too hard for laughs and some of the time they did succeed, but fell short quite numerously! Jonah Hill&apos;s character got few lines, but when he did, they were fairly funny. I did enjoy Justin Long as he is coming into his own as an actor. Kevin Heffernan didn&apos;t get nearly enough funny lines or the proper camera time he deserved, I mean he&apos;s Farva for the love of god, the man is funny. With all this being said, wait for the DVD. Poor plot, great actors, but wrongly used their talents! Severely disappointed in this film.....I even went opening night I was so excited.....stupid film.....not even a stoner flick at best and trust me I love stoner flicks!",

However, if you watched his career as an intellectual, statesman, Playgirl centerfold, master of doublespeak, and perpetual bad hair day guy, then you may find this documentary compelling. The film is a credible and balanced indictment, given time constraints, which tells of Kissinger&apos;s rise to power and ultimate abuse of that power which, hindsight being 20:20, contributed substantially to the killing fields of Cambodia, the horrific war in East Timor, and an assassination in Chile which led to a brutal dictatorship in which American interests were strictly commercial. Directly or Indirectly, the renown Nobel Laureate de faux pas, may have caused the unjustifiable deaths of enough innocents to qualify him as a war criminal and yet today he has sufficient credibility to gain appointment, though short lived, as top cop in the 911 disaster investigation, still serves as CEO of his own consulting firm, and leaves the telltale odor of megaloegomania wherever he goes. An intriguing digest of Hitchens book of the same name. (B)",

I believe the German TV titled this movie : DER SALPETER KRIEG.\n\nI found this movie very impressive at my age of 15, and I still remember a few key scenes. A young tenente (lieutenant) leading a platoon of chilean soldiers In the Atacama desert against a perubian - bolvian foe, in the 1860&apos;s. Doing house to house searches, fouraging for food and water, having a few firefights with local milicia. Some soldiers voicing doubts about their mission, some retain a patriotic stance. Various characters from very different walks of life , well portrait. The acting was superb. The movie ends with a dramatic climax and a futile patriotic message, somehow fatalistic . Very much en vogue with the contemporary anti war message of the period. A very underrated and overlooked gem, this movie deserves an international DVD release.",

The result is a parody of zombie films that feels similar to some early Woody Allen films.\n\n&quot;Zombieland&quot; is grossly gory and tongue-in-cheek. It pays homage to many films of the zombie genre and dozens that are not. Surprisingly funny, its humor is spot-on and effective, helped by a strong cast that includes Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.\n\nThe script hits the right notes continually, whether they are comedic or tender. And each twist feels right, keeping things interesting. The film never lags; it just shifts into a different gear.\n\nThis is a surprisingly fun film and it feels like it would stand up to repeated viewings.",

Obviously the best thing to do in a situation like this is to bring the snake to the US (Actually Canada filling in for California) Naturally the snake gets loose and continues doing what giant venomous satanic super snakes do best. BITING PEOPLE!!! Good stuff.\n\nThe FX are done on the cheap. Lots O POV shots, inter-cut with VERY quick shots of a GIANT balloon-y snake head on a too thin looking body, inter-cut with screaming bloody people tossed around. The whole thing was done on the cheap for the most part. There is one well done super venomous bite that makes a guy break out a little. They probably spent half the budget on that one shot. You&apos;ll know the scene when you see it. If you like bad horror flicks from the 80&apos;s. You&apos;ll probably dig this movie. If the snake doesn&apos;t scare you, Oliver Reeds mustache will.",

Other critiques have noted it was a &quot;pat&quot; ending, but I&apos;d like to think that it was just a beginning... As Chad remarked, to Patsy &quot;Believe it or not, I am Irish&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "Jezebel was Bette Davis&apos;s consolation prize for losing the Scarlett O&apos;Hara sweepstakes. Considering the sacrifice that the title character makes in this film, it is fitting and proper that Davis got this role because she could have had Scarlett, but she wouldn&apos;t make Gone With the Wind if it included Errol Flynn as Rhett Butler.\n\nJulie Marsden is as willful and and spiteful a southern belle as Scarlett O&apos;Hara ever could be. But Scarlett would never deliberately violate the code the way Julie does and wear that red dress to a cotillion. Just simply not done in the best families.\n\nBette Davis is Julie and while she&apos;s going to be married to the very proper Henry Fonda, she likes the idea that she can still turn the head of every young blade in New Orleans. Especially George Brent&apos;s head as the dashing Buck Cantrell.\n\nWhen Fonda doesn&apos;t jump at her beck and call he prefers doing business to catering to her whims she decides on a daring move. This is a woman who cannot stand not being the center of attention. She wears a red dress to a cotillion when polite society dictates that all the unmarried young ladies wear white. When she does, New Orleans society shuns her as effectively as the Amish can and Davis retreats to her plantation upriver.\n\nFonda goes north and returns after a while to New Orleans with Margaret Lindsay who he is now married to. An insult our southern belle won&apos;t put up with. Davis sets in motion a string of events that results in a lot of tragedy.\n\nI have to say that just a description of the plot seems a bit ridiculous at times, but Bette Davis does make this whole thing quite believable. She won her second Oscar for Best Actress in this film and as her aunt who occasionally gives her a reality check every now and then Fay Bainter was named Best Supporting Actress of 1938.\n\nFonda and Brent are fine in their parts, but they are in support of Bette Davis in a Bette Davis film. Another performance I liked is that of Donald Crisp as the doctor who fights a lot of prejudice and ignorance in New Orleans in trying to deal with yellow fever.\n\nLooming over all of the film is the knowledge we have that this society will come crashing down in another eight years or so in events so well told in Gone With the Wind. This film should be seen back to back with Gone With the Wind as a view of southern society.\n\nThis was Bette Davis&apos;s first film with director William Wyler who she admired above all other directors. Davis was not generous with praise for colleagues so any kind words towards one are really something. Apparently Wyler did have the magic touch in handling Bette.\n\nJezebel is one of Bette Davis&apos;s finest films, maybe not the finest, but definitely right up there. Unlike Davis&apos;s first Oscar for Dangerous which she said was a consolation for not winning for Of Human Bondage, this one she was proud of. And we&apos;re proud of it too.",

Son Ye Jin absolutely suited the role which was to be played and so did Jung Sung Woo. At the beginning, he was seen as an arrogant man with little feelings, and yet the way Son Ye Jin taught him the way to love and treasure life was so touching. Until tragedy struck for her, it was a great movie. It was love at its highest level. I would recommend this movie to anyone in this world. Even to those who dislike draggy love movies, this movie teaches a lot about treasuring your loved ones before its too late. An absolutely great production. I Love this movie. Watch It!",

They investigate the Guantánamo Bay detention facility (GITMO) used by the United States in housing enemy non-combatants for purposes of interrogation to seek intelligence that can be used in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).\n\nIt is clear that the filmmakers do not like the facility; they raise issues regarding application of the Geneva Conventions, and also propose there is a linkage between tough practices for interrogation developed at GITMO and the disaster at Abu Gareb in Iraq.\n\nThe documentary, however, does present alternative views, and on the whole this work is balanced and not a piece of propaganda. It raises serious questions regarding the new environment of GWOT, including the role of private contractors and the issues raised by Al Quaeda not being a country, but rather a private organization. In other words, what are the legal and ethical issues that arise when &quot;war&quot; is not between countries, but between countries and private organizations.",

So, I have a bias towards this sort of film and some may NOT be excited in seeing the biplanes flying about during the movie (even though many are post-WWI planes when they are supposed to be WWI aircraft).\n\nRichard Dix, Robert Armstrong and Joel McCrea play three buddies who served in the Air Corps during the war. However, now that about a decade has passed, they are forced to make a living working stunt flying for a sadistic film director (Eric Von Stroheim). Eventually, just how evil the director is and the depths of his evil come to light and this leads to a dandy, though grisly, conclusion.\n\nInterestingly, of the three pilots, the least famous and important was McCrea, as he was not yet an established star. The other two (Dix and Armstrong) were big names, though only a short time later they were relegated to &quot;has-been&quot; status. All did a decent job and the film, though a bit tough to believe, was entertaining and was more than just a time-passer.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The White Parade&quot; is a film not unlike all medical series set in a hospital that we&apos;ve seen over the last half-century. Marcus Welby, MD, ER and Scrubs are just some of the shows that relate to this exceedingly rare Oscar Nominee.\n\nThe film is set in a medical training hospital, where nurses are rigorously trained for duty in real hospitals. Loretta Young is the main nurse, June Arden; there are several other we follow from inception to graduation.\n\nThe film is slow and comical at first but becomes more dramatic near the end. A fine pre-cursor to other medical dramas, with decent performances. The film is short, 80 min, and feels like it could have been longer.\n\n&quot;The White Parade&quot; is indeed an extremely rare film in that the only surviving print resides at the UCLA archive. I watched this film, and, to say the least, it is in very bad shape (this is why it has never been released on home video.) The print is fuzzy and almost bleached out, yet still watchable. Near the end of the film, it inexplicably cuts to an image saying, &quot;disc 7.&quot; Fast forward a little and we continue the film to the end.\n\nSeveral frames are cut and spliced together, and some frames &quot;jump,&quot; where we see two different frames on screen at once.\n\nI guess UCLA hasn&apos;t had a chance to restore it yet... I&apos;m sure they will someday.\n\nOscar film buffs, if you ever get a chance to go to UCLA and watch this film, do so!",

      "reviewBody": "After watching the trailer i was really hyped about the movie because of its theme and potential to be a really good movie. But on the other side i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended up. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or Ilisium with much cgi-effects and bad story and no real story and/or characters. \n\nSo i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But then, right from the beginning, i knew this movie would be fantastic. The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny, filled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from the beginning to the end. I don&apos;t like Tom Cruise in general but this role just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really satisfied with everything. \n\nTwo main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i watched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i don&apos;t like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don&apos;t like movies with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her favorite actresses of all time.\n\nOh well, 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "I really liked &quot;Baby Boy.&quot;  But maybe that&apos;s because I&apos;m as white as they come.  I&apos;ve just read some other User Comments here, and whether John Singleton does or does not dish-up nothing but stereotypes about blacks, I won&apos;t debate.  Look, I totally dug this film because of other reasons. While watching &quot;Baby Boy,&quot; I had two thoughts:  1) that I don&apos;t relate to the &apos;black&apos; culture presented, but 2) this didn&apos;t matter because I did relate TOTALLY to a lot of the issues at the core of this story. Psychological and emotional issues about growing up, about cheating, about love, about undesirable characters working their way back into your life and screwing everything up.  And so on.  OK, I understand Users&apos; complaints here about &quot;stereotypes,&quot; but I say to them, &quot;Don&apos;t worry about it... this white guy kind of thought the same thing, too, and so this movie didn&apos;t paint a picture for me of &apos;what all blacks&apos; lifestyles must be.&apos;&quot;  Dudes, all I saw were universal themes about, like I said, about love, about becoming a responsible adult, and all that.  White people go thru exactly the same shi.. stuff.  Those universal themes just happened to be wrapped up in some kind of black wrapping paper.  This viewer set that paper aside, and appreciated the gift inside.  This movie really pressed some emotional buttons with me, and I appreciated it.  [And by the way, we white people don&apos;t assume that all black people see all white people as the characters we are presented as in films: all the terrorists, rapists, mid-western nerd housewives, financiers, CEOs, trailer-trash, etc etc etc.  Why do (some of) you assume we think ALL blacks &quot;are&quot; as presented in films such as &quot;Baby Boy&quot;?  We don&apos;t.  Period.]\n\nIn fact, I could relate to the issues of this film&apos;s men AND women.  So, this script was universal in that way, too.  Anyway, here&apos;s all what I really wanted to say about this film:  All these emotional issues were brought to life by EXCELLENT performances.  (I say Ving Rhames is one of our best actors working in America today.  He is consistently excellent; I never see him &quot;acting,&quot; I always only see him &quot;being&quot; his character.  And his performance here in &quot;Baby Boy&quot; was Oscar-worthy, if you ask me). \n\n I had no idea, until the ending credits, that &quot;Baby Boy&quot; was written and directed by John Singleton.  Honestly, while watching it (on cable) I was convinced that it must have been written by a woman, because it so perfectly expressed such poignant emotional moments.  Of course, the actors - and Singleton as director - can also share credit for those moments.  Also while watching, I had the thought that &quot;this is well-directed; who did this?&quot;  I guess my point here is [and this comment may annoy some Users here] that &quot;Baby Boy&quot; offers proof of Singleton&apos;s talents as one of those very good filmmakers who actually DESERVES the accolades critics and &quot;industry&quot; people give him.  [Although, I never saw &quot;Higher Learning,&quot; which Users here say stunk.]  Anyway, not the BEST film ever, but a solid 3 out of 4 stars. [Okay, one more word about the acting in this flick:  I&apos;m an actor myself, and many of the performances here made me LOVE acting... there were nice meaty scenes and speeches here, and always so well done that it made me proud to be an actor.  (Especially one monologue by Mr Rhames -- phenomenal, Sir!).  Bravo to all this cast.]  Perhaps the best overall thing I can say about &quot;Baby Boy&quot; is that it left me wanting to see it again."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is a mystery. It&apos;s not scary, it&apos;s spooky. You&apos;ll probably jump at some points and for some of it you&apos;ll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora&apos;s box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won&apos;t go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. I know movie buffs won&apos;t regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn&apos;t have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Jolie&apos;s brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but I do think the way the Malachi ending works is something to talk about. I&apos;ve recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.",

And while I neither have a beef or any other sort of involvement in the Bushido/Sido war going on, I have to admit, this one is far better than &quot;Zeiten ändern Dich&quot; (german title of the movie), which wasn&apos;t really good.\n\nOf course the director on this also did Chico, so you can expect something good. Or should in any case. The story might take expected turns and it might be a bit predictable here and there, but it still is really good. There are some laugh-out loud moments in there too, so the comedy aspect of the movie does work (though again not really in a silly way). I wouldn&apos;t really compare it with 8 Mile though (something the other reviewer did, only thing I disagree with), because this is much lighter than the Eminem movie.",

She turns out to be a &quot;teaser&quot; as writer-director Stewart Raffill flashes back to what happened before a boating mishap. Restarting, two wealthy couples arrange for a yacht in the Bahamas to take them out for some fishing and fun on the water. One couple may really be shark food, apparently. Focus on the other couple, balding but rich Billy Zane (as Jack) and his beautifully proportioned wife Kelly Brook (as Jennifer). They hire muscular wavy-haired Juan Pablo Di Pace (as Manuel) to serve drinks and help out on the boat. You get the picture? If not, you don&apos;t pick up signals very well...\n\nNow, also part of the set-up is an arousing local native, hot-tempered Maria Victoria Di Pace. She has a fight with Mr. Pablo Di Pace before the ship hits the sea. You should note how they slap each other around. As a parallel, Ms. Brook likes to be tied up while Mr. Zane reels it in... \n\nMaria likes to draw pentagrams and play with her voodoo doll. This seems to drive the plot of the &quot;Three&quot; sex-obsessed &quot;Survival Island&quot; inhabitants. Women must end up on top. It is silly in the opening scenes and gets sillier later. So, why is this film any good? A couple of reasons... \n\nYou should not be asking how Mr. Zane washes up on the beach with bloody feet. Maybe he found an air pocket under water and ran around on sharp sea shells; possibly, the baggies covering Zane&apos;s feet slipped off just before he reappears. Ignore the voodoo and incongruities. If a Bic pen can survive, so can a cigarette lighter. Mr. Raffill and his crew, especially photographer Tony Imi, skillfully present pretty scenes in a luscious location. The women and Pablo Di Pace are incredibly beautiful, but the star attraction is absolutely Brook. Her wardrobe consists mainly of a white bikini and a big, sheer green shawl. She fits and fills the screen quite nicely. Brook never stops titillating and never has to try.\n\n***** Survival Island/Three (11/16/2005) Stewart Raffill ~ Kelly Brook, Billy Zane, Juan Pablo Di Pace, Maria Victoria Di Pace",

The story is acceptable if nothing fancy, but the rest is bad or worse, the &quot;gore&quot; effects are laughable, this is truly a LOW budget movie, and it shows in every single scene. Normally i dont mind naked females in movies, but here it was so... not needed, the scene with the naked women was just sad.\n\nThe only way to watch this movie is with drugs and/or a lot of drunk, REALLY drunk friends, then it would most likely be a godsend, or at least viewable.",

      "reviewBody": "Without giving away too much, S.I.N. Theory is a lo-no-sci-fi about a mathematics professor who has discovered that the fate of people&apos;s lives can be extrapolated using the history of their Social Insurance Number (SIN)...Social Security Number in the US. Of course once such a powerful tool is discovered, there will be competing ideas on how it should be used and the story expands from there. I take it this is the writer/director&apos;s first foray into the sci-fi genre and for a fist go, he managed to come up with an engaging storyline. Everyone knows that we have to use our SIN/SSN for virtually everything, from credit cards to getting your cable TV hooked up; what is ultimately done with all of that info is always up for a good debate. I enjoyed the movie as a thought provoking flick while at no point trying to persuade the audience to the director&apos;s point of view. I can see how some may disagree with the low-key pacing, but my only beef with the entire film is when the professor tried to prove to the female lead that his theory was correct by &quot;predicting&quot; things he saw on the street; that scene actually went against the premise of the movie where the theory predicted a person&apos;s fate over their entire life span...not a day-day basis. Other than that, I tip my hat for pulling this off on such a tiny budget, and look forward to what he&apos;s able to springboard onto next.",

Some even saying the director should receive some &quot;props&quot; from being so quick on the draw on capitalizing on this. However, anyone who actually follows films outside of what they read in People Magazine will know that this film was being shot BEFORE Crash, and had actually been completed as far back as June 2005. It is a film that was in pre-production a year before that. Unfortunately, the distribution company decide to hold this film from release until this past weekend, prompting hack critics to say it&apos;s just a knock-off of this year&apos;s &quot;Best Picture&quot; (also to be strongly debated).\n\nThis is a film that doesn&apos;t need to have a Hollywood ending. Is driven by such strong performances and directing that it leaves you motionless in your seat at its conclusion. A rare film that hits harder and harder with each repeat screening. I could go on and on about the performances of Marcia Gay Harden and Forest Whitaker (who by the way gives his best performance to date in this film), but what was even more impressive was the performances by the younger actors on screen. The Son of Marcia Gay Harden and the character &quot;Jay&quot; both blew me away by the quality of their performances.\n\nAmerican Gun is well worth the money. Please don&apos;t be closed-minded and see this film as just a knock-off of Crash. Just because a movies is released after another film DOES NOT MEAN that it was made after that film. It&apos;s just bad luck for this movie and for first time writer and director Aric Avelino, who proves excellent movies can still be made with a purpose and without big budgets.",

      "reviewBody": "Lars von Trier&apos;s Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a film-goer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation (and so does this one) but this film is the kind that&apos;s beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you&apos;ve watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman&apos;s quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film (not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman&apos;s intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film). If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career, if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway, you get the picture The film stars Emily Watson as Bess, a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan (Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional). When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in, he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications, Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan&apos;s life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale, but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful, frightening, and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her one-sided conversations with God (in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds) are both funny and sad, not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is. The film is made with a hand-held camera and a visually stunning solarized style. This style does not make the movie; it just adds richness to each scene in the way it gives each face such shadowy texture. In the end, von Trier seems to believe in God but does not believe in the churches that try to codify what he wants. All of this works because of von Trier&apos;s passionate desire to understand how one can please God under horrendous terms; the epilogue, that takes the already-great material to a new level and shows how inspired von Trier is, starts with a moment of sad irony and then leaps to the skies with an image that fills the most atheistic person with questions and the more religiously spiritual people with hope. Here is a film that reaches for the stars and makes it there."

      "reviewBody": "One of the things that all of the films about Norway during World War II fail to mention is why the Nazis were there in the first place. All of the Scandinavian countries would have gladly sat out this war as they did World War I. In fact all, but Sweden got into it for various reasons.\n\nIn the case of Norway, it&apos;s simply the long Norwegian coastline. Even before the Soviet Union was invaded, Hitler saw the necessity of preventing supplies from getting to the Soviets should they break the Hitler-Stalin pact and enter the war on the allied side. The convoy route used was the one into the Arctic Ocean into Archangel and Murmansk. No other route was possible for American lend lease. The Nazis operated bases from Norway and sank a lot of allied shipping in the North Atlantic.\n\nSo this is why this small village and so many others like it were occupied and why the country was invaded. The Norwegian people from the king and queen on down, knew their country was in a sideshow theater, yet they did resist as best they could.\n\nIn fact Mr. Churchill did mount a counterattack in Norway, but the invasion failed and British troops had to withdraw. From time to time he brought up freeing Norway during allied conferences, but could get no support for it from Roosevelt or Stalin.\n\nErrol Flynn stars in Edge of Darkness and the usual Flynn derring-do is kept on hold. Probably in keeping with the stoical nature of Scandinavian character. He&apos;s not exactly Captain Blood in this one. He&apos;s a fisherman, but his natural qualities of leadership come through as he leads the resistance.\n\nEdge of Darkness is the story of one coastal Norwegian village who put up with Nazi occupation beyond what was humanly bearable. The rape of Ann Sheridan finally touches off a revolt.\n\nIt&apos;s not a star vehicle per se. Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan have a great deal less dialog than they would in most films. Edge of Darkness is a study of the various townspeople and the way each one of them deals with the Nazi occupation.\n\nWalter Huston and Ruth Gordon are the parents of Sheridan and John Beal. Huston is the town doctor and tries to remain above the battle. Gordon, like Patricia Collinge in The Little Foxes, retreats into nostalgia. Sheridan is a resistance member and Beal was an informer in Oslo, but only the immediate family know it at first.\n\nHowever the performance I like the best is Charles Dingle&apos;s. Dingle has always been one of my favorite character players ever. He&apos;s Gordon&apos;s brother, the owner of the cannery, and he quite deliberately chooses to collaborate with the Germans. He&apos;s the kind of villain you love to hate as is Helmut Dantine the commanding officer of the Nazi garrison.\n\nWe learn Dingle&apos;s fate at the beginning of the film and as the action unfolds in flashback the audience really rejoices in that fate.\n\nNo mistake about it, Edge of Darkness is a World War II propaganda film, but still entertaining today",

This is one of the best versions of ice skating combined with music that I have ever seen. I can watch it over and over. The skating is fabulous and Katarina Witt is a very sexy Carmen. It brought the story to life much more so than just the music alone. I prefer it to the opera version. Plan to see a ballet later this year of Carmen so it will be fun to compare the skating to the ballet. I like to see movement with the music and the skaters do it justice. The setting and scenery was good too. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Carmen is waiting in the bar for her soldier to come and she is tapping nervously on the counter. It&apos;s very well done and I highly recommend it\n\nNow I need to know where i can get a copy of it!!",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1996, the movie focuses on budding writer Novalyne Price Ellis (Renée Zellweger) and her experiences with famous pulp writer, Robert E. Howard (Vincent D&apos;Onofrio), creator of Conan the barbarian and other characters, like Kull, Solomon Kane and Red Sonya. The events take place in central Texas (Cross Plains and Brownwood) during the last two years of Howard&apos;s life, 1934-1936, and are based on Novalyne&apos;s memoirs &quot;One Who Walked Alone&quot; and &quot;Day of the Stranger: Further Memories of Robert E. Howard.&quot; Ann Wedgeworth is on hand as Robert&apos;s sickly mother.\n\nHoward&apos;s great imagination and expertise with words made him &quot;the greatest pulp fiction writer in the whole wide world,&quot; as he was known. Unfortunately he died way too young at the age of 30 but, thankfully, he was prolific and so we have a lot of material by him to enjoy. It has always been a mystery to me why this talented man died the way he did, but this film gives life to REH&apos;s last two years and helps the viewer understand what happened.\n\nThis is a true-life drama with elements of romance consisting of the simple way of life of a writer, his parents and friends in the plains of central Texas in the mid-30s. Most of the sequences take place at the quaint Howard abode, the theater in Brownwood, the school where Novalyne taught and, mostly, Robert &amp; Novalyne driving the desolate landscapes or walking and talking, sometimes in conflict. In other words, this is a simple drama. The potency comes with the subject matter, Robert E. Howard. I found the drama gripping as insights emerge in the dialogues and other sequences.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in the heart of Texas (Austin, Bartlett, Bastrop and Rockne).\n\nGRADE: A-",

It was actually enjoyable to watch Damon Wayans&apos; character make all these far-out gadgets... some of which look totally outlandish, but actually make sense! Sure, the comedy may be a little too goofy for some, but in the end, it helps. This movie also helped me further my belief that if you get out there and do something about a problem, you&apos;ll be making a real difference in a world of indifference.\n\nthis movie is worthy of an 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Die englische Heirat&apos; straddles the line between comedy and drama, and does so very well. Renate Müller plays Gerte Winter, an amazingly emancipated mechanic and driving instructor who has built her own car (a machine that looks more like a rocket on wheels) out of parts cannibalised from older models. She falls for her English student driver Douglas Mavis (Georg Alexander) and accepts his proposal. The problem is his snobby grandmother lady Mavis (Adele Sandrock) back in Britain, who has other plans for her grandson. When Douglas (whom the others call something sounding like &apos;Döck&apos;) proves too much of a coward to tell the old lady of his marriage, complications ensue. Acting is good, with Müller, Sandrock and Anton Walbrook, who plays the family lawyer of the Mavisses, standing out. The plot offers a few interesting turns and funny moments and moves fast - there are no dull moments whatever. &apos;Die englische Heirat&apos; was of course filmed in Nazi-Germany, but the regime is nowhere in evidence. In fact, Gerte&apos;s role as a female mechanic could be read as implicit criticism of the Nazi-government, which had just enacted a law that penalised female participation in the labour market (the aim was freeing up jobs for men and reducing unemployment, with women who lost their work because of this law being expected not to register as unemployed). To some extent, the film does make fun of the British aristocracy, though the Mavis household will remind you a bit of Downton Abbey. All in all it is good, harmless entertainment, very watchable even after almost nine decades.",

It was good to see Christina Applegate again, this time playing a more diverse role as Courtney Rockcliffe.

While the film is rather long and talky, it is also surprisingly compelling, aided considerably by its two excellent central performances, particularly Isabelle Renauld&apos;s; its semi-documentary/flashback framework, then, leads to a shocking, inevitable finale. Having a relationship with a beautiful, mature woman is every young man&apos;s dream and, for a while, Francis Renaud lives it but before long, his unwillingness to let go of his chauvinistic male friends (who are prone to graphically describe their sexual prowess in front of his female companion) and seriously commit to his relationship is too heavy a burden for them both; ironically, it is Renaud&apos;s attempt at taking on the role of father-figure (by taking an interest in Renauld&apos;s teenage girl) which triggers off the differences between them and which keep escalating as the film goes along. Out of the three films I&apos;ve watched so far from this interesting and controversial French film-maker, this is certainly the best so far and I&apos;m looking forward to catching more of her work in the future. Luckily, I&apos;ve managed to convince my pal at the local DVD rental store to add the Criterion DVD edition of Breillat&apos;s A&apos; MA SOEUR! (2001) to his already impressive library...",

This film is as if a little hole was torn in time and the viewer is allowed to peek through. The film feels like  a documentary and the dialogue is largely ad-libbed and not always well, which gives it a realistic feel. One feels like these\n\ncharacters could actually be real and that they don&apos;t exist merely for the sake of the story. Some may criticize this film for its lack of character development, but these guys aren&apos;t the type to open up and pour out their feelings, and if they try, it usually doesn&apos;t come out right. The realism and authenticity of this film make up for its lack of character development and swiss cheesy plot. Definitely worth seeing."

That night, Gerard and Megan make love and a nude Gerard plays his cello in the dark.\n\nThe next morning, the mind-gaming sisters play a trick on Gerard, who gets a bloody nose in the process, but when they invite themselves on his road trip, he doesn&apos;t flee in terror, as any sensible person would.\n\nAbout halfway through the movie, we&apos;re trying to decide what&apos;s more ridiculous: the over-the-top emoting over deep, dark family secrets; Dominique&apos;s personality; the cello-and-fiddle jam session at a country-western bar; Gerard&apos;s big, dumb puppy-dog eyes; or the fact that we&apos;re still watching.\n\nThis movie is like a car wreck or a murder scene.

      "reviewBody": "Raoul Walsh had just come off _The Birth of a Nation_ both as one of Griffith&apos;s assistant directors and as an actor (most prominently as John Wilkes Booth), when he made this film. In his autobiography, Walsh credits Griffith with &quot;teaching&quot; him not only about much of the art of fiction filmmaking, but also about production management technics that aided him in taking full advantage of many of New York City&apos;s most pictorial exterior locations.\n\nThe locations play an important role in adding to the naturalism of an otherwise highly melodramatic plot with the high society young woman turned heroine social worker (much overplayed by a major star of the 1910s, Anna Q Nilsson) and the regeneration of the one-time Lower Manhatan gang leader.\n\nThe wonder of this film is the performance of the male &quot;star&quot;, Rockliffe Fellowes, who played in over a dozen nearly unremembered films until he died in 1950. His performance is so subtly varied and electrically alive that one is reminded of Brando in his early 1950s films. An interesting sidenote about his performance: The movieola film editing machine -- that magnified the small 35mm frame to about 4 inches by 6 inches as it ran the film stock through the viewer at the proper projection speed -- was not invented until much later. In 1915, editors had to hold the footage up to the light to see each frame and/or use a magnifying glass; but they could not also run the film at speed at the same time. Hence, many of the subtlest nuances that cross the hero&apos;s face could not be clearly seen and judged in editing: _Regeneration&apos;s_ editor often cuts away before the movement has settled, or cuts into a close or medium shot of the hero after the nuance has already begun.\n\nWatching the film on a large screen today, one is aware how powerful present-day editing technics are at capturing all such movements in the hands of a skilled editor. In _Regeneration_ there is a distinct feeling of rough editing at the moments we leave or cut to the hero at the &quot;wrong&quot; instant. By the way, the original title was NOT _The Regeneration_, but _Regeneration_ alone. From which we can surmise that Walsh was looking to create a work with universal meaning."

      "reviewBody": "Long unavailable, you can now (2011) buy this on DVD in an Italian release. No English subtitles but if you play the Italian subtitles you can work out what is happening. I wanted to see it for two reasons. First, I&apos;m trying to watch all the various film versions of Ilf and Petrov&apos;s 1920s Soviet novel The Twelve Chairs. The plot - a man inherits a set of dining room chairs with jewels stashed in one of them, and a frantic chase ensues to find the right chair after the set has been dispersed - has been used various times, most notably by Mel Brooks in 1970. Second, the bizarre international cast seemed to indicate this was a really classic instance of international co-production of the type so common in the late 1960s. I was particularly interested, as a British viewer, to see stalwarts of 1970s British TV in an Italian-made film. What would the results be like?\n\nAfter years of waiting, I was not disappointed.\n\nIn no other film will you see:\n\nWillie Rushton declare his love for an ultra-camp Tim Brooke-Taylor - in dubbed Italian\n\nTim Brooke-Taylor camping it up with, in separate scenes, Orson Welles and Vittorio de Sica\n\nWelles play Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as if in a pantomime\n\nTerry-Thomas as a lorry driver.\n\nMylene Demongeot as a prostitute quite happy to hire out her chairs for men to make love with.\n\nAnd so on and so forth. The film is typical of the late 60s kaleidoscope approach to film-making - throw every bizarre ingredient into the mix and see what happens, a la the original Casino Royale. But this film, while wildly dated, still entertains in a giddy sort of way, because it&apos;s fast-paced, there are no boring passages and you never (and I really mean never) know what will happen next. \n\nIf you like late 60s cinema, then this is a crucial watch. It is also valuable to watch if you are a student of British comedy, as you get two different comedy traditions - an older one music hall represented by Terry-Thomas on the one hand, and a newer TV satire one embodied by Rushton and Brooke-Taylor on the other - playing out in the context of an Italian film. It&apos;s really interesting to watch this if you are interested in the history of British comedy. I am pretty sure that no film historians writing such a history have included Twelve Plus One, but it deserves at least a side mention of British actors being used for international co-production purposes. The results are odd but fascinating.\n\nI should also note that Ms. Tate is charming and certainly at the most beautiful I have seen her in any film. The tragedy of her early death is underlined by watching this film, where she does seem hugely magnetic. You do get a sense of why Polanski fell for her in real life.\n\nOverall, Twelve Plus One is well worth seeing. It is a perfect time- capsule of what European films were like in the late 60s. It has a silly charm that still works today - in fact, the film may play better now, at forty years&apos; distance, than it did when it was first released."

      "reviewBody": "This Danish tale captures the bond of childhood friendship like no other. Tinke and Larus show us the true unrestrained nature of a growing friendship and the personal connection resulting.  Their relationship is extremely well explored and conveyed in a way that actions and interactions give way to an underlying appreciation that is almost purposely left in the background.\n\nThe story itself is sweet, funny and cute.  The fairytale undercurrents, which have labeled the film almost exclusively as a family film in Denmark (to M.Køhlert&apos;s regret), are no real deterrent to a mature adult viewer. The director in fact tried hard to make sure that this movie would in no way be restricted or even geared prominently towards children audience.  He struck a nice balance.  This could very well be a slightly eccentric drama that happens to have children as main characters.\n\nThe two actors, pulled from a large casting call, are in fact the life of the movie.  Excellent, excellent work from these young lads.  Sarah Juel Werner shines through and through, and Peter Jeppe Hansen does a magnifical job in perhaps the hardest role of the two.  Real tears, real smiles, real emotions.  The innocence of first time actors.  In fact, the director spend more time just being close to them (playing, bringing them to McDonald&apos;s, talking,...) than actual rehearsing.  It took an average of 5 to 6 takes.\n\nKøhlert did an outstanding job with the material. The screenplay adapted from Cecil Bødker&apos;s novel is very tight.  No unnecessary moments.  Ends on a high note.  Humour maintained throughout.  Engrossing and charming. The directing was kept simple.  Very effective.  Let the actors show their craft.  Let the script tell the story. Keep the camera close to the actors so you could be there experiencing the film with them (character association).\n\nThis movie should enchant you by its candor and life.  By the light humor and the many touching moments.  Bring your kids if you want, but don&apos;t go see it for them, see it for yourself!!\n\nMorten Køhlert&apos;s real first feature (we can forget &quot;Under overfladen (1999)&quot; contract-for-money affair with no personal involvement or creative liberty), he comes out as an excellent director and great person.  He is by far the friendliest and down-to-earth director I have ever had the chance to meet. Curious.  Eyes wide open.  Frank and modest. He told me he&apos;s currently working on a thriller/drama.  I wish him an abundance of international and personal success.\n\nFirst time in North America, he loves Montreal.  He&apos;s says he feels like he&apos;s in a movie (not quite, but you made a great one).  Hope he&apos;ll be back.",

It mostly features interviews with people who knew Agee, as well as reenactments of scenes from Agee&apos;s life and readings of his works. I&apos;ve never read any of his works, but have seen some of the movies to which he contributed. The point is - and the documentary makes this clear - that James Agee was an indispensable member of the literary scene in the &apos;30s, &apos;40s and &apos;50s. Whether writing about poverty, the body politic, cinema, or something else, Agee always had something to say. Anyone who wants to consider themself well-read should read at least one of Agee&apos;s works. In the meantime, do watch this documentary.\n\nPS: Agee also wrote a review in The Nation of the Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot;, which features Bugs as a concert pianist.",

Jun Lana is nonetheless an acclaimed writer. I am not doubtful that his story has a good plot. There are inconceivable twists coalesced within the story. It is skillfully crafted with less abrupt contrivances. Mag-ingat ka sa... Kulam is an efficiently written horror film with a dash of dramatic overtones. This fine material fits well for a versatile actress like Judy Ann Santos. Despite the film&apos;s adequacy in writing, good production value and favorable performances from Judy Ann Santos and Dennis Trillo; the film&apos;s execution is unpromising. The film might be a success to most of the people who have seen it. On my part, I did not perceive any visionary schemes for it to appear exceptional.\n\nMira (Judy Ann Santos) remarkably survives a car accident. But she suffers the loss of memory. Strange things start to happen at their house. Even her husband Paul (Dennis Trillo) seems unwary with Mira&apos;s intuition that something eerie is going on. He believes that it is a result of the traumatic accident. It is also revealed that Mira is not close with her blind daughter Sophie (Sharlene San Pedro). She makes an effort to be close to her daughter but she is constantly distracted with the mysterious things recurring upon her. One day, she was visited by her business partner Dave (TJ Trinidad). Dave admitted that they had an affair in the past. He confessed a secret only the two of them knew. With his assertion to uncover Mira&apos;s past, she discovers more than she must not be aware of her true being.\n\nKulam is a result of malevolent incantations by witches and sorcerers alike. Its fusion in Philippine Culture is undoubtedly good material for film exploration, dissection and even exploitation. However, Mag-ingat ka sa... Kulam only scratches the surface of this fascinating world of witchcraft and sorcery. It resorted to familiar chants in gibberish dialect, maladroit representations of warlocks, and unflattering undertones of native myths, customs and rituals. Even the depiction of the evil spirit is not justified. I am certain that even in the point of view of a writer and director; he must have achieved a vision that accurately illustrates the evil spirit. It certainly makes an effort to use prosthetics so it&apos;s deliberated that the spirit must look horrible, but why? Are there clues for us audience to understand even on the basic level why on earth she appears like that? She looks like a leper, or did she acquire any skin disease of some sort? Or is it just for the sake of making a horror scenario creepier? An obvious prognosis for this delineation will entirely make an audience jump from their seats. Okay, for a horror film to sell, the wicked spirit has to be frightening. Evil usually equals scary ugly. It&apos;s an interesting point though. Mag-ingat ka sa... Kulam makes the mistake of jejune characterization, especially for the horror persona they have shown. But for a writer-director, the sin is twofold.\n\nAnother thing, there are spooky circumstances in the film that is terrifying but has not hinted any just rationalization. A tuft of hair in blood is found in the cabinet. Is a person&apos;s head bumped on that sturdy piece of furniture? The water in the bathtub boils and the evil spirit emerged. Even her hair is falling apart, implying that the spirit had cancer. It is spine-chilling but it has no purpose. It leaves empty scares. Even the suppose to be promising story in its essential level is made to clutter with the film&apos;s strive to bring about horror and a disturbing atmosphere without giving thoughts of its intention. Witchcraft is so vague and films have no purpose to conceal a story&apos;s progression. The film could be indicted of contriving the plot if found not adequate in its motivation of the characters.\n\nSantos still has the imperative charisma an actress must possess. It definitely shows in the jam-packed theatre, despite the fact that the ticket rates are costly (roughly two hundred bucks). She did very well in her portrayal even though some parts were inexcusably dubbed (Regal do it in their films on purpose). Trillo as her leading man is quite a relief and a surprise. They make a good pairing and I would love to see them again in future films, possibly in a drama feature. I have said it in the past that I am not a TV guy, but I am dumbfounded with Neil&apos;s (Mart Escudero) role in the film. Is he the male evil spirit? Or is he the newest heartthrob sensation in showbiz? And yeah, I have been acquainted with Kris Bernal in her &apos;tomboy&apos; role in Loving You. She might have done a delightful stint in that film so she had a role in this movie even though her character is uncalled for.\n\nMag-ingat ka sa... Kulam has been backed-up by a good production company that is why their output is nearly well-made technically. The film&apos;s story is cleverly made on the very basic level. Its crucial element in fusing witchcraft rituals is delightful but it is clear that it only dwells on an atmosphere we are accustomed and supposed to believe in. Lana&apos;s recent work has relied on sound cues to mangle our breath with scary enchantments. The story&apos;s twists are quite fine; praising it exclusively on its own is well deserved by Lana. But I will not buy the evil spirit inspiration because it is merely a fixation for horrible things to look more horrible. The film also lacks good execution in elevating horror without being overshadowed by emotional cues from its musical scoring. Its subject matter on its own is creepy and only a clear vision is the tool to make this material work in a film&apos;s standpoint.\n\nRating: 2.5/5"

      "reviewBody": "**SPOILERS** Uneven and somewhat ridicules thriller that has local psychic Sharon Avery, Tahneew Welch,going through all the slings and arrows from the police newspapers. Sharon eve has her befuddled and frustrated husband Larry, Currie Graham crewing the carpet as she&apos;s thought to be an unstable kook until her visions attract the serial murder Billy Morton. Whom Sharon claims to be in psychic contact with to make her his next victim.\n\nWe see Sharon at first working with the police on a missing person case that she solves with the little boy later found murdered in an alley just where Sharon says he was. The killer who&apos;s on the scene follows Sharon back home in his car and runs her off the road causing Sharon to lose her eyesight. Back home and feeling sorry for herself and not wanting to live anymore Sharon ties a weight to her body and throws herself into the swimming pool but just there and then her visions, psychic not normal, comes back to her as she sees a young girl being murdered in a park. Quickly changing her mind, by swimming to the surface, about leaving this realm of existence Sharon goes back to her psychic visions in order to help the police to prevent or solve the murder.\n\nBack with the living it seems that no one knows, and Sharon never tells anyone in the movie, about her attempted suicide and new insight on going on living but the movie audience. Sharon desperately calls the police about her vision of murder and tries to stop it before it happens. The police that includes Insp. Frank Schumann, Michael ironside, and his partner Det. Fay Howard, Anne Marie Loder, are not at all impressed with Sharon&apos;s revelations. This action on the part of Schuman &amp; Howard seemed a bit strange when we saw her earlier in the movie solving a murder for this same police department, and police officers, and probably having solved a number of other cases in the past! \n\nFinding the missing girl murdered like and where Sharon said the police, and her husband Larry, are more against Sharon using her psychic abilities then ever before with the exception of the now believing Insp. Schumann who&apos;s told by his superiors to have Sharon put off any future missing persons cases. This gives you the impression that someone upstairs in the department is trying to have them covered up.\n\nThe movie &quot;Black Light&quot; has Sharon&apos;s husband Larry, a computer software engineer, working with Dr. Anna Gdard, Lori Hallier,who&apos;s treating his wife to cure her of her blindness. Dr. Gdard thinks that with the help of a new visual system that her medical computer company is producing she can get Sharon&apos;s sight back. As Sharon&apos;s sight improves her visions are recorded on video tape showing just who the serial killer is which has him move in for the kill on Sharon to quite her, and her visions, forever.\n\nFull of plot-holes and misdirections by the movie-makers that by the time you should get really into the movie you lose all interest in it. Just by the credits you already know before the movie even starts that there&apos;s no suspense in &quot;Black Light&quot; to who the killer is since he&apos;s none of the people you would usually suspect in the movie are not playing the role of the killer; he&apos;s just actor Billy Morton in the credits! \n\nThe ending with Sharon being chased by Morton is so ridicules with him acting more blind then she does and not even being able to find her even though she seems to know her way around the house and front lawn with out as much as tripping over anything. The films conclusion is too outlandish to even describe, you have to see it for yourself, with Sharon defying physical and mechanical science as well as common sense to do in the crazed killer and with Insp. Schumann who Morton strangled earlier in the movie comes back from the dead but not in time to save Sharon;it turned out that Sharon didn&apos;t need his help at all!",

      "reviewBody": "Having trouble in engaging myself in the start of this movie, being a dramatization of the Alistair MacLean novel, it soon grew on me. The funny understatements back at the headquarters I immediately started loving.\n\nOn the cover of this Norwegian edition DVD it&apos;s stated that MacLean has had18 of his novels made into films. I think this a successful adaption, though over shone by &quot;The guns of Navarone&quot; and &quot;Where eagles dare&quot;. That said, it&apos;s a pity that his most exiting novel &quot;Night without end&quot; from 1959. Shurely it would be a great film to make even today.\n\nThis is very like an 70&apos;ies James Bond-film, where we meet Anthony Hopkins as an agent, not very unlike James Bond. There&apos;s even a Bond-girl. He is sent up to a rural part of coastal Scotland, MacLeans native country, to investigate why there are so many ships getting lost up there. He gets to find himself not very well welcome.\n\nI think Robert Morley is magnificent in his role as Uncle Arthur, and so is Anthony Hopkins as agent Philip Calvert, which have naturally bad manners, according to his boss, being born to a lesser class. Uncle Arthur&apos;s Lines are hilarious, and much wittier than his equals in James Bond-movies.\n\nAgent Calvert kills off bad guys like puppets on a chain (!), and the film keeps the mystery for a long time, making the ride an interesting one. This tells me Hopkins could have been a great Bond.\n\nThe film is very time typical of early 70&apos;ies, and it&apos;s a lovely coast and salty water film. You literary smell the salty sea water. It gets more entertaining and exciting as the film proceeds, and I think that it&apos;s a great period piece to watch.\n\nRecommended for those enjoying classics!",

Ottar is his local soccer team&apos;s best player when, in the film&apos;s opening minutes, he announces to his team mates, his father and his teenage son, not to mention a local journalist there to do a sports story, that he is gay. What follows is a highly entertaining, feel-good movie about being true to yourself and winning, if not all of the people then some of the people, (the right people, presumably), round to your liberal way of thinking.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t shirk away from more serious issues such as homophobia and the effect of coming out has on your wife and family, but as Ottar finds other players to join him when he is ostracized by his own team and eventually form a &apos;gay team&apos; of their own, they are not interested in gay agitprop but in simply having a good time. This they manage to do despite the almost perpetual rain that seems to plague Iceland, at least when this film was made. Very enjoyable, then. All that&apos;s missing is any trace of football.",

      "reviewBody": "Dracula (Christopher Lee) rides again in yet another Hammer entry in the Dracula franchise. This film is enjoyable horror hokum, but it has an awfully shallow story, fleshed out with a slow opening stretch and some amusing vampire lore in between the sporadic vampire attacks.\n\nFour British travellers are journeying through the Carpathian Alps in the 1800s. They are repeatedly cautioned to steer clear of Carlsbad Castle but, being typically stuffy and stubborn, they end up going there anyway. The castle is deserted apart from a rather zombified manservant. During the night, one of the travellers is slain by the manservant, and his blood is used to resurrect the long-dead Count Dracula. Time for another bout of blood-sucking mayhem....\n\nChristopher Lee has a small role this time around, but gets across a good performance due to his commanding presence in the title role. Andrew Keir is also good as a priest-cum-vampire-slayer, though he has to overcome some dumb dialogue. The slow build-up is rather damaging, as it generates more tedium than chills. The opportunities for real terror are somewhat fudged too, since most would-be &quot;shock&quot; moments are telegraphed too far in advance. However, Hammer buffs and vampire addicts will doubtless feel more than satisfied."

It really gets better when the character Tulip is introduced. She is the heart of this movie and by far the most entertaining part. Thank you for featuring her so much. Almost everything she says is funny. I guess I just have a soft spot for genki girls. Pinkie Pie is the one who comes to mind most at any time. She even has red (pink?) hair like her. The best parts are probably her interacting with her personas.\n\nI admit that the story makes little sense. How exactly are babies brought into this world now? We briefly get to see the process of how a baby is made. I love how big and epic this movie gets. Yes, it&apos;s technically short, but it still gives you everything you would want in a good movie. They have a lot of great details and it leads up to an exciting climax. As a huge fan of &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, you have to watch the great short that precedes this. If only &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; did stuff like that nowadays. It&apos;s great to see a good movie based on an original concept too. ***",

      "reviewBody": "A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized &quot;United 93&quot;. At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.\n\nAs it turns out, Greengrass&apos;s heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That&apos;s not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.\n\nThe power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. The film also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, it is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.",

It&apos;s also rare to see the run-down mostly red brick houses typical to Wallonia in a movie.\n\nWhen it comes to the plot, there are quirky moments which are worth a chuckle or a fright, but in general this film is rather long-winded, making it boring at a few instances even if it only has a run-time of roughly 80 minutes.\n\nNonetheless it has its touching moments, especially when both protagonists visit one of them&apos;s parents and the end scenes.\n\nBut in the end Eldorado is not a film I would recommend, except to people who are fond of Belgium.",

      "name": "Burt Kennedy&apos;s first passable Western about the Sioux flight to Canada after Little Big Horn 1876",
      "reviewBody": "When the savage Sioux come to Canada following the death of General George Armstrong Custer , 1876 , the Canadians and the Queen of Commomwealth permit them to stay in Canada if they come peacefully . Nevertheless , some hunters kill all inhabitants of one of their villages and carring out Buffalo massacre . As a rancher (John Dehner) attempts to recover a stolen or strayed horse from Indians who had nothing to do with said horse . Along the way killing a number of the Natives , but almost losing their own lives in the exchange of shootouts . Shortly, a Canadian Police superior officer (Robert Ryan) followed by his underlings (Torin Thatcher , Metcalf) executes a dangerous mission . Running into trouble with the rancher , but kept to the narrow and straight by the Mounties . The cowboys seek to get back their horses , but they are detained by the Mounties , and they state that pretend to search for a girl who once had been kidnapped by the Indians , but Mountie Ryan takes the hunters charged with murder .\n\nSpectacular and enough budget western with thrills , adventures , fights , go riding , gunfire , emotion and being mostly shot on location in Saskatchewan . This is an impressive saga of the conquest of the Saskatchewan territory where the Royal Northwest Mounted Police stood alone against the fury of the Custer-massacring Sioux and the Cree nation . Despite Robert Ryan and John Dehner presences , a completely average movie , with a trite screenplay and regularly paced . Thinly written for the screen by Burt Kennedy , author of the original script allegedly based on facts , as the exciting story is fictionalized, but based on the Assiniboine massacre that occurred in Saskatchewan in1873 and including some disapponting moments . On the plus side , there are reasonable good acting from a nice cast and support cast . As main cast is pretty good , it stars the estimable Robert Ryan who incidentally performed a Mountie in his first movie : Cecil B. De Mille&apos;s North West Mounted Police . Ryan was a fine actor who interpreted some classic Noir Films and a lot of Westerns , such as : Hour of the gun , The Wild Bunch , The Professionals , Ice Palace , The Tall men , Return of the bad men , Best of the badmen . But he also outstood playing other genres as Wartime : Anzio , The Dirty Dozen , Battle of Bugle , Berlin Express , Flying Leathernecks , The longest day , Men in war , Billy Budd ; and Noir/thriller genre : On dangerous ground , Clash by night , Caught , The Racket, The Set-up , Crossfire , Beware my lovely , Back from eternity . Support cast is frankly fine , such as : John Dehner as a vengeful rancher , Torin Thatcher as a very authentic and striking looking officer and Metcalf as an inept Mountie . The female lead is taken by pretty Brooklyn Opera singer Teresa Stratas as a captive , but she has little to do and isn&apos;t in it very much , exception for her usual songs , being the film constantly slanted by her . Other secondaries appearing are John Sutton , Richard Alden and Michael Pate as Chief Four Horns .\n\nThis colorful movie belongs to Canadian Mountie sub-genre, as films about Mounties always get entertainment and amusement , they have been few and far between ; including important titles as the classy ¨Unconquered¨by Cecil B DeMille with Gary Cooper , Robert Preston , Paulette Goddard , ¨Pony Soldier¨ 1952 by Joseph M. Newman with Tyrone Power and ¨Saskatchewan¨ 1954 by Raoul Walsh with Alan Ladd , Shelley Winters , J Carol Naish , Hugh O&apos;Brian . The Canadians packs a glimmer and rousing cinematography by Arthur Ibbeson, showing splendorous landscapes . As well as an evocative and sensitive musical score by Douglas Gamley . This movie was filmed on location in the real Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan, Canada , with a nice camera work by cinematographer Arthur Ibbeson . The motion picture was ably made by the great director/writer Burt Kennedy . Here&apos;s a thrilling manhunt tale written and made by Kennedy , later to become one of America&apos;s foremost filmmakers . There he maintains comfortably in the ordinary traditions , though it has some flaws . Kennedy was a good professional , a fine director who made several Westerns and being usual screenwriter of the notorious filmmaker Budd Boetticher. Kennedy was kept on at Batjac to write films for producer Wayne. His initial effort, 7 Men from Now (1956), was a superb western, the first of the esteemed collaboration between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott. Kennedy wrote most of that series, as well as a number of others for Batjac, although it would be nearly 20 years before Wayne actually appeared in the film of a Kennedy script. Burt was a prolific director , writer , and producer , being essential his deep collaboration as a great screen-writer to director Budd Boetticher , the latter considered to be one of the best Western filmmakers . Kennedy directed all kinds of genres with penchant for Western , as Burt made quite a few Westerns , such as : The Rounders, Return of the seven , Welcome to hard times, The war wagon , Support you local sheriff , The good guys and the bad guys , Hannie Caulder , Support your local gunfiighter , Dirty Dingus Mgee , Young Billy Young , The Alamo , The train robbers , Down the long hills , Big bad John , Where the hell&apos;s that gold ? and Once upon a Texas train . The Canadians is no earth shattering seeing experience at all, but with its saving graces as the gorgeous , glimmer outdoors , and the presence of its main actors , it is just about worth a look .

Stars Fred Mac Murray &amp; Jane Wyman as well as veteran Disney  child actors Tommy Kirk &amp; Kevin Cochoran, and the late Deborah Walley.  Real star of this film is the old Ocean Liner SS United States.   - 1962 was the twilight of the big Transatlantic Ocean Liners and &quot; The Big U&quot; shows herself in all her glory. Shot on location in Paris and the Riviera, it gives us a look back at Paris back in the 60&apos;s with all the fads and fashions. A bit dated for today&apos;s tots. This film is probably better suited for adults looking for a nostalgic look back."

      "reviewBody": "When I saw this movie on a Friday night in Brussels&apos;s largest cinema, the theatre was almost empty. We were there with about eight or ten other people. It&apos;s clear that My Queen Karo is not a crowd pleaser. That&apos;s a pity, because this film is well-written, poetic and beautifully filmed. The subject, the life of a young family in a squatter&apos;s community in Amsterdam in the seventies, is interesting enough. But the thing that makes this film something special is the point of view: the story is seen through the eyes of a young child, who doesn&apos;t really understand everything that is happening around her. The way this dreamy, naive child reacts to the conflicts around her (including those between her parents), is what makes this film stand out. Nevertheless, there were a few things I didn&apos;t like. The fact that the father is Dutch-speaking while the mother speaks French is a nice statement about bilingual Belgium (their home country, as well as director Van den Berghe&apos;s) but doesn&apos;t serve any purpose in the film. I suspect that the possibility to obtain financing from the French-speaking government played a part in the decision to make the film bilingual. In any case: Deborah François, who plays the mother, is a joy to watch. Matthias Schoenaerts on the other hand (the father) is sometimes over-acting.",

      "reviewBody": "Starring Steve Martin, Rachel Ward, and Carl Reiner. My first time watching this comedy/mystery; I liked it enough. I appreciate the decision to film it entirely in black and white; the reasoning for this primarily being because of the several &quot;cameos&quot; by such stars as Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster. The writers really did their research. Bits of movies with some of Hollywood&apos;s most illustrious stars like Stanwyck, Cagney, Crawford, Lake, Lana Turner, Bette Davis, Bogart, Laughton, Price, Ladd, Bergman, Cary, Kirk Douglas, Gardner, and Lancaster were incorporated into the movie&apos;s plot.\n\nIt was interesting to see classic Hollywood actors &quot;co-starring&quot; with Steve Martin. I thought that was an original and ingenious idea. I thought it was funny how Veronica Lake&apos;s character was named &quot;Monica Stillpond.&quot; I quickly figured out who they were talking about once they said her name.\n\nActually, most of the vintage-clip characters are more or less playing themselves-- When Martin calls up hysterical Barbara Stanwyck from Sorry, Wrong Number, he explodes &quot;Listen, you phony fruitcake!&quot;, Ingrid Bergman from Notorious is &quot;F. X. Huberman&quot; and James Cagney in prison from White Heat is Cody Jarrett who won&apos;t talk to anyone but his mother (or Martin in disguise). And of course, the line where Charles Laughton from The Bribe asks &quot;And do you know who I might be?&quot;, Martin replies, &quot;...The Hunchback of Notre Dame?&quot;\n\nI remember when this movie came out in 1982, when B/W movies were still &quot;the Late Show&quot; trivialized on television before the VCR and Cable movie-rennaissance came along, and nobody got the jokes. That is why it flopped. Most knew that old movies in general were being featured, but only about 10% actually knew which movies, and--as it was Martin&apos;s first movie after &quot;The Jerk&quot;--most just focused on the comedy scenes where Steve pours coffee or shaves his tongue.",

It&apos;s a 1974&apos;s Poland. Young marriage Jan and Wanda Filikiewicz, moves from one little room to a large flat. Unfortunately, a former husband of Wanda Filikiewicz came along with them, because twisted regulations allows that action. Poor Jerzy is trying to kick off uninvited co-tenant Jerzy Dabczak, but everything he touches, turns back to him. But it&apos;s going even worse - clever Jerzy does his best to make hell out of Jan and Wanda&apos;s life. Just like other Bareja&apos;s comedies, &quot;Nie ma rozy bez ognia&quot; is fully understandable only for someone who lived in Poland those days. And believe me - it&apos;s one of the best polish comedies ever.",

You would think this is a cliché, wimpy Mickey Mouse movie (quite the contrary);however, if you&apos;re looking for a landslide from boring Disney movies I would recommend this this. This is also has a hint of sarcasm in this movie which is extremely rare for a animated Disney movie. Comedy is one of the many reasons you should see this movie."

      "reviewBody": "I had no idea what to expect from this, but I&apos;m familiar with Bijou Phillip&apos;s work and although she usually plays trashy characters, this one is definitely her best role yet and would love to see her play more of them. There was something different about her, she looked fantastic! She comes off as a quirky, sweet, off-beat woman called Carys (pronounced Care-riss) who apparently has no feelings towards others until she attends a strangers funeral and meets her future love, Tyler (Ian Somerhalder) who&apos;s mourning the death of his fiancé, Anna. Carys lives with her hilarious roommate Lila (Marguerite Moreau) who has major issues of her own, she also shares personal thoughts with her best friend Shane (Danny Masterson), a funeral director who is accused by Tyler for possibly taking Anna&apos;s engagement ring that has mysteriously disappeared off her finger. Meanwhile, Carys later discovers that Tyler may be hiding something too.\n\nThe movie had great chemistry between the characters and I found it perfectly engaging, which is rare for me when it comes to these rare types of story lines that sound like it might be awful but completely surprises you in the end. I would definitely call it original, something you wouldn&apos;t expect in a movie.\n\nIt pretty much offers everything from plenty of light humor that doesn&apos;t overshadow the rest of the film, romance with a touch of mystery/suspense. Depending on the way you view it, it&apos;s actually kind of tragic, too, because the story deals with the death of a loved one, more than once. One thing I would change about the film is a little more emphasis on Tyler&apos;s dead fiancé, Anna, maybe some flashbacks of their time together? I think if we met her, instead of just hearing about how wonderful she was, we would feel more sympathy for Tyler losing her.\n\nIt&apos;s not a sappy PG-13 romantic-comedy type, although it may seem that way in the beginning with the whole ring thing. (Rated R for language although not frequent - more than one f-word, and two love scenes - one being particularly steamy without nudity). I would say it&apos;s something that&apos;s worth watching more than once (seen it twice) and if you don&apos;t take the dialog too seriously, you will most likely enjoy it too.",

The film tells of a man and a woman who meet in a &quot;sexaholics anonymous&quot; meeting and become involved in deceit, betrayal, sex, murder, suicide, and a whole bunch of yadayadayada. Although this film features some fine Spanish actors and is a well composed and stylish shoot, the story is just too much ado about too little with insufficient payoff. Forget the title as it has nothing to do with anything is this drama which could have been about the undoing of a man because of sexual addiction or a murder mystery or even cheap sexual sensationalism but instead plays out like so much busy work with little to praise, little to fault, and very little to care about. Not recommended for nonSpanish speakers. (C+)",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;On Dangerous Ground&apos; is a very original and striking movie, one of the most interesting to come out of 1950s Hollywood. The movie is in two halves. The first is urban and sees Robert Ryan play Jim Wilson a brutal but seemingly moral cop who appears to be on the brink of a complete breakdown. His character could well be the toughest cop ever seen on screen until the early 1970s heyday of Dirty Harry and Popeye Doyle,etc. The second half is rural, with Wilson being sent out of the city to investigate the murder of a young girl (shades almost of Stellan Skarsgard in 1997&apos;s &apos;Insomnia&apos;). There he encounters a local blind woman (Ida Lupino), the sister of his number one suspect. The first half is as I said, extremely tough, the second half is ALMOST a mystery (yet it&apos;s obvious who the murderer is), and ALMOST a romance (but handled in a very subtle and &quot;unHollywood&quot; way). It&apos;s an odd combination but really works because the script lacks cliches, Nicholas &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; Ray&apos;s direction is very fresh and inventive, and the acting is first rate. Lupino makes the most of her supporting role, as does Ward Bond (&apos;The Searchers&apos;) as the father of the murdered girl, and Sumner Williams as Lupino&apos;s disturbed younger brother, but Robert Ryan steals the movie. I&apos;m beginning to regard Ryan as one of the most underrated screen actors of all time. Just watch him in this, the boxing classic &apos;The Set-Up&apos;, &apos;Crossfire&apos;, &apos;Bad Day At Black Rock&apos;, and of course, &apos;The Wild Bunch&apos; and see what I mean. &apos;On Dangerous Ground&apos; deserves a much larger audience. Highly recommended."

Its never going to win any awards, and doesn&apos;t even try to. From the 5-second rule to the intermingled sex lives of the staff to the retarded manager, this movie hits the nail right on the head. It seems like someone in Hollywood finally got some money to throw around and decided to pay homage to his life before being &quot;Someone&quot; in Hollywood. I laughed till i cried through the first 30 minutes and the rest of the movie was just as good. It&apos;s destined to become a cult classic for anyone in The Industry and will definitely be on my bookshelf the day it comes out. As long as you go in only with expectations of being grossed out and laughing till it hurts, you will not be disappointed!!",

Interesting installment from Brian Depalma, the director of Carrie, his unique style indeed makes for an interesting film. Deniro&apos;s portrayal of a developing voyeur is one of the few comedic roles that I have seen him do so well.  A movie worth watching for anyone interested in film making, as many techniques are quite interested."

      "reviewBody": "Hokey but enjoyable RKO biopic of Jim Fisk, 19th century financier and crook. As with most historical biopics, this is more fiction than fact (especially the end). Actually, I&apos;ll say this is even more loose with the truth than the average historical biopic from the time. The story tells how Fisk (Edward Arnold) rises to financial success on a series of crooked deals with his two cronies (Cary Grant, Jack Oakie). Eventually he has a falling out with one of them (Grant) over a girl (Frances Farmer).\n\nEdward Arnold is always worth watching and this is no exception. Cary Grant fans will likely be disappointed at his supporting role, which is more suited to a Patric Knowles type. Still, there are moments where Cary shines above the material. Such as the scene with the bratty actress where he tells her she&apos;s ugly. Jack Oakie and Donald Meek are fun comic relief. Of note for having one of the better roles of Frances Farmer&apos;s career. She&apos;s very good here and, if you don&apos;t know about her, you might wonder why she didn&apos;t go on to bigger &amp; better things. Well, you should look up her story. It&apos;s very interesting and tragic. Overall, it&apos;s an entertaining movie. Goes on a little longer than it needs to and the romance stuff is blah. But solid performances and healthy doses of humor help. Worth a look if you&apos;re a fan of old Hollywood biopics.",

Not even a decent DVD release it had and if you ask around in Brazil, everybody will say Toy Story was the first movie made by CGI, what&apos;s a propaganda lie, Toy Story used models made out of clay, Cassiopeia is the first movie entirely made in CGI.\n\nThe year was 1992, they had 15 people working in the animation with 17 486 DX2-66 computers integrated. After the movie was completed nobody wanted to distribute it and the film was released during Olympic Games, resulting in no advertise and no interest by media. I&apos;m not a person who believe in conspiracy theories, and I continue not believing because to understand why the movie was ignored, all you have to do is read the history of Brazilian products, more specific of Gurgel, and you will see how Brazil treat its things and also understand why Brazil will always be a third world country.\n\nAbout the movie, it&apos;s great. A very good and interesting history, I really liked the characters, remember we were in 1992 when production started, but the not realistic look of characters give us the sensation of a history happening in other part of universe. I confess I wasn&apos;t expecting anything more than the fact it was the first CGI movie of History, but it&apos;s a very entertaining movie, there&apos;s music and all, inspired in the Japanese animes.\n\nUnfortunately, no english subs, no international release and if you ask about Brazilian animation, this movie won&apos;t be remembered.",

I&apos;ve only looked back to see that I have it in my collection...but not on DVD! These studios need to start thinking back to the days in which movies as good as these were made and stop producing so much garbage that they think will make tons of money without considering whether it&apos;s done right or not. This film taught me just how important gesture and body language can be in the acting world, whether it be on film or on stage. I know just how &quot;in-character&quot; an actor is just by looking at their face, their eyes, and how they&apos;re written in the script. Don&apos;t get me wrong, people can overact and underact in certain parts, but if you do anything without considering your character&apos;s expression or mood, regardless of whether or not your voice is unbearable to hear, you will never see success past the sound of crickets hiding in the audience. The industry knew that sound was coming. Most didn&apos;t accept this truth, but they knew it alright! &quot;Wings&quot; reminds those who&apos;ve seen it, as with most classics of the silent cinema, that ACTIONS SPEAK A MUCH GREATER VOLUME THAN THE SPOKEN WORD. I&apos;ve said all I need to say, and now I&apos;ll let this picture speak for itself."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Red Rover&quot; also called &quot;The Haunting Within&quot;,is an eerie ghost story.it is beautifully photographed with a haunting Celtic soundtrack.the acting is certainly good,and the the movie is very stylish.However it is almost painfully slow at times and sometimes plot is real hard to make sense of. there are a few creepy moments and i was reminded more than once of the movie &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; with Robert Deniro and Dakota Fanning problem is,there are fewer of these eerie creepy scenes than there should be so you will need lots of patience to get through this one.Another reviewer does mention the Changeling,the 1980 horror film,starring George C. Scott and Red Rover definitely does echo that movie heavily.both movies are also very slow at times.so this movie is not entirely original and is almost anti climatic.however the ending was a twist which i did not see coming(though many people likely would have),so that was pleasant surprise.if you don&apos;t mind a slow buildup towards an ending that is very subdued(as is the whole movie)you might like this one.for me,i don&apos;t think i could sit through it again.the music and the picturesque beauty of the film do elevate it a bit,so i would give it 5/10",

I encounter these enough to know that they should exist and I am glad of it.\n\nIts a bit different when the intent of a film is to serve a prurient need outside of the context of what we consider &quot;real&quot; movies. Porn is usually discriminated from other films by existing outside of the need for story. This isn&apos;t quite right because there&apos;s always story, its just with porn the stories the viewer brings are so strong and deep that they only have to be referenced in the briefest of shorthands. These stories and shorthands interest me because the implied stories are (I think) complex and the shorthands are clean, universally understood and succinct in their visual form.\n\nSo I spend time with films that purport to mix porn and real storytelling. Michael Ninn impressed. Max Candy maybe. Some single projects from the 70s.\n\nNow this. Its unapologetically porn, but on the softish side. What&apos;s interesting is that if you take it as porn it seems to deliberately cancel itself because (like &quot;Sex Psycho&quot;) it covers so many types of sexual encounter that it is bound to offend whatever story a porn-inclined viewer will bring. \n\nThe story thread of this is clever enough to warrant description. Its designed as if it were a chapter in a &quot;Bladerunner&quot; world: replicants designed for (or at least adapted for) sex. The story is pretty complex, not in what you see but in what is explained. A replicant takes on seven bodily forms, so as to collect a variety of intense orgasms (apparently the Japanese term for orgasm is iku). The purpose of this is to transfer them to a pill so an evil corporation can make money and gain power. By transferring the orgasmic knowledge to the company, the replicant will buy her freedom.\n\nThe &quot;Bladerunner&quot; allusions are scant except for one critical piece in the very beginning where we (and it seems the replicant&apos;s control) encounter an origami crane from &quot;Bladerunner.&quot; If you know that movie, you&apos;ll know that the crane plays a key role in switching the whole focus of the story from that of the theatrical release to a radically different and more exciting one in the &quot;director&apos;s cut.&quot; I won&apos;t detail the shift here, but it had to do with shifting into the realm of directed dreams. And that&apos;s big when it comes to stylish porn. Worth looking into.\n\nSpeaking of &quot;into,&quot; for some reason the filmmaker chose to have a repeated effect of a woman&apos;s (and one a man&apos;s) &quot;insides&quot; as penis/hand/probe thrusts. Its a puzzling choice.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

Jaime Pressly is ridiculously goddess-like hot and meant for worship in this standard erotic thriller. This is supposed to be a feel good movie, it gets it&apos;s job done and how!!!!!!!!!! I give it an 8 out of 10 based on the fact that it serves it&apos;s purpose and does what it&apos;s supposed to do. Winning Oscars ain&apos;t it.

I think it inspired me to become an &quot;underground filmmaker.&quot; I like the style, the scenery, the story, the humor, the depiction of life behind the Iron Curtain--particularly for the Gypsies. I still remember the scene where the one character is throwing feathers off the back of a truck, and the fight scene underneath the feathers. And the &quot;wedding&quot; scene where the &quot;monk&quot; says &quot;Any fish in that river, Tisa?&quot; And where the heroine runs away to the big city and attempts to live by singing on the street. (Is this where she is hitchhiking and gets seduced by a puppet-wielding truck-driver?) Also the use of non-actors--local people--in the film. I don&apos;t know if the world presented in this movie is realistic or romanticised, but it was a very good film and it deserves to be seen again today."

      "reviewBody": "Rama Krishna (Ram) is the son of a Gandhipuram village president (Nassar). His father is a strict disciplinarian and wants Rama Krishna to be perfect. Rama Krishna is a funny youngster who pretends to be good in the presence of his father but does a lot of mischief on his back. Ashok (Arjun) is a mafia don in Mumbai and he goes into a sabbatical after the death of his his wife. Ashok along with his two sisters settles in Gandhipuram. Rama Krishna unfortunately gets in to the bad books of Ashok. Meanwhile,. Ashok&apos;s past catches up. The rest of the story is all about how Rama Krishna uses his intelligence and muscle power to achieve the good will of both his father and Ashok.\n\nRam comes up with yet another energetic performance. His dialogue delivery in Godavari dialect is nice. NTR gave the voice-over to the introducing of hero character.Arjun suited the role well and he dubbed his own voice. Priya Anand is alright as female lead. Bindu Madhavi&apos;s role is pretty much limited. Naseer is extremely good. Brahmanandam&apos;s character doesn&apos;t offer required level of comedy. Pruthvi and Bharat are entertaining. Srinivas Reddy is one of the most promising comedians who can generate laughter with his dialogues like Ali and Krishna Bhagawan. He is good in this movie. Gracy Singh did a small role as Arjun&apos;s wife. Sekhar&apos;s (Chatrapati fame) performance is odd in the first half.\n\nStory of the movie is little formulaic with inspirations from films like Basha (Arjun&apos;s character) and Bangaru Bullodu (villains searching for hero in villages). Unlike earlier movies, the director preferred straight narration where the mafia don&apos;s role is revealed in the first scene of the movie.\n\nANALYSIS: First half of the movie is alright. Interval episode is good. Second half becomes predictable. Climax should have been better. The plus points of this movie are Ram, Arjun and commercial elements. This movie suffers from predictability and lack of freshness in second half. On a whole, RRKK is a commercial film that is intended to cater to families and masses. We have to wait and see if this movie clicks with the target audiences or not.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Omen&quot; is one of those movies that still hold up so well, there&apos;s really no need to remake them. The date of June 6th 2006 was probably the most tempting thing for producers to release a new version of this film now.\n\nWell, you can&apos;t say they did a bad job. This year&apos;s &quot;The Omen&quot; is solid as a rock and very faithful to the original. So faithful in fact, that one has to wonder what the whole point of it is.\n\nLiev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are an odd choice for the leading couple but they&apos;re both okay in their respective roles. The direction is just okay, too, but you gotta be thankful that no cheap scares (or not too many of them) were thrown in to keep viewers interested. On the other hand, it must be said that the movie is a bit slow at the beginning, especially if you already know the plot. Opinions will differ on how well recent events such as 9/11, the tsunami in Sri Lanka or the death of Pope John Paul II. were integrated into the story, but that&apos;s not really a major issue. The few changes John Moore made involve a different way of dying for one character and two or three rather effective dream sequences (the last one sticks out - it&apos;s a sequence of really creepy images without any sound effects at all, probably my favorite moment of the whole movie). Also watch out for a nice reference to &quot;Don&apos;t Look Now&quot;.\n\nThe most interesting thing, however, is the complete absence of the infamous choral score that made the original so scary. God knows why it&apos;s not here, it sure wouldn&apos;t have seem dated.\n\nIf I realized anything watching this movie it&apos;s how amazing the script was in the first place. It builds up perfectly, it&apos;s thrilling as hell (excuse the pun) and there are no plot holes to be found. This is why &quot;The Omen&quot; still works greatly and will hopefully be enjoyed by a lot of young people who haven&apos;t seen the original. For everyone else there&apos;s no reason to spend money on a movie we have already seen in a superior version.",

      "reviewBody": "Reviewers seem to have struggled with this dramatisation of a sometimes quite modern German novel that came out in 1809, the action being moved from Saxony to a gloriously picturesque Tuscany. I think the problems start with the book, where you have to decide for yourself how serious it is meant to be. \n\nIs the author moving his characters around the chessboard for fun, so we can laugh at their foibles, or is he in deadly earnest about the destructive effects of our strongest emotions? Or should we see a bit of both, enjoying some of the comedy in the initial conflicts of love and duty (to name just two) but deeply sorry at the end over lives lost or blighted? It is a complex work of many layers, too many to discuss here.\n\nA film can only show elements of the story and has to leave out much. Rightly, in my view, it is centred on the basic equation of the middle- aged couple A and B inviting into their quiet lives the unmarried C and D. Sticking to the human trajectory, that goes from innocent love through forbidden love to tragic deaths, it can only hint at or has to ignore many other aspects of the novel: social, cultural, scientific, religious and philosophical. \n\nPerhaps this is why some viewers have not felt satisfied? Is there an appetite for doomed love affairs among rich people in Europe two hundred years ago? I suggest that there will always be if, like this one, they are well told, well cast and well shot (even though the baby&apos;s red wig was a bit over the top!)."

      "reviewBody": "This small independent movie was probably the least hyped movie Hilary Duff has had and it&apos;s ironically also her best (imo of course). Greta is sarcastic but not over the top witty that it becomes annoying (alas Juno - sorry Juno fans, I disliked that character). I feel a part of this can be attributed to Hilary&apos;s girl-next-door look turned brat delivery. I can imagine other actresses of Hilary&apos;s ilk trying out this role and not succeeding as well as she has. The character&apos;s narcissistic flaws are shown but a part of you likes her because of it. Her selfishness juxtaposed with her tolerant grandparents is fun to watch but also kind of sad and sorrowful when you realize why Greta misses her father and acts the way she does. The tension is nicely subtle and with modestly effective emphasis on supporting characters. Although the title itself features the main character&apos;s name, I liked the fact each supporting character is also appointed their own personal back story and just how this all comes into play with Greta&apos;s decision.\n\nThe performances were delicately fine. Hilary, well what can I say, she has won me over! Although I liked some of her earlier teen work, I don&apos;t think I took her for someone who could carry this film - and she did so well. Hilary definitely soars this time around! Ellen, Michael, Melissa and Evan are all strong support.\n\nProps to Michael Gilvary for writing a simply funny and touching but not annoyingly sardonic and sappy film.\n\nThis is indeed, Hilary&apos;s best!",

MAY not only operates as a great horror film, it also is a wonderful character study of social dysfunction. Angela Bettis is wonderfully painful to watch in her attempts at love. She&apos;s an actress to keep your eyes on in the future.  The ending gets a little more standard but is just creepy enough to keep you on the edge of your seat."

      "reviewBody": "I couldn&apos;t avoid relating it to the most disturbing novel I&apos;ve ever read: &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (William Golding, 1954) I won&apos;t go into details, but suffice to say that both this movie and the book deal with the dark side of human nature and both have perturbing effects on our minds and consciences. Those who are familiar with the book will know what I mean.\n\nThe characters in both the movie and the book live detached from society, their rules and morals: In &apos;Lord of the Flies&apos; British kids, educated in a private school, are castaways stranded in a wild island. Eventually their civilized coat wears off and their inner savagery shows (safe a few characters who remain civilized). Sean Crawly (Chris McKenna) is a current boy, but he is also a dormant killer. Favourable circumstances(money and impunity) will trigger his wicked self.\n\nI&apos;ve read fuming comments here in the style of &quot;how on earth such normal boy is able to become a killer? This movie is bad!&quot; What turns our stomachs is that his victim is innocent. The scene of the killing is horrifying but what makes it unbearable is that we know that Crawly knows he is killing an honest man. We don&apos;t feel so uncomfortable anymore when Crawly takes his revenge.\n\nThe scene with Sean Crawly and Duke (George Wendt) at the zoo is also significant. Duke explains how humans can be compared with animals. Notice the pun in Sean&apos;s surname (Crawly) and how he is compared with a reptile and also with an ant.\n\nI find that the title of the movie and Duke&apos;s cut-of head may be a conspiratorial wink to &apos;Lord of the Flies&apos;. Maybe it&apos;s a coincidence, but the similarities are too obvious to be ignored.\n\nThis is a horror film. We may like the plot or not, agree with its development and ending or not, but.. kudos for all the actors and their director. In my opinion their performances are convincing and irreproachable.",

Though today&apos;s generation may find it&apos;s pace somewhat slow.\n\nIt has more than mere entertainment value. Like &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, it deals with an era that has gone forever. Pre-independence Bengal and Calcutta come alive in this movie. Its portrayal of life of landed gentry pre-independence Bengal is quite authenticate.\n\nIn short, A must see for all those who have always wondered why every broken heart self-destructive lover is called a Devdas.",

It was really one of the most peaceful and clear movies I&apos;ve ever seen. Watching all the small movements of the sleeping body (John Giorno), the shadows on it and all the details was a nice game that took 5 hours 21 minutes. At the beginning of the show a guy came in and fell asleep in the cinema. His loud snoring was the best soundtrack you can imagine.",

      "reviewBody": "Richard Heuberger&apos;s &apos;Der Opernball&apos; is not quite one of the greatest operettas like &apos;Die Fledermaus&apos; and &apos;Die Lustige Witwe&apos;, containing a corny and old-fashioned story where one really has to suspend disbelief in places.\n\nHowever, it has a lot of enjoyment and charm, with comedy that genuinely entertains, has charming characters and while there are slightly more memorable operetta scores the music is beautiful and tuneful, the most famous being &quot;Im Chambre Séparée&quot; (colloquial for &quot;Komm Mit Mir Ins Chambre Séparée&quot;).\n\nThis 1956 film of &apos;Opernball&apos; (a colour remake of the also enjoyable 1939 film in black and white) does a good job maintaining the fun and charm. The comedy really does sparkle, and the storytelling is elaborate and snappily paced with plenty of parts to make one laugh and go ah. It does start off a little slow and it doesn&apos;t do enough to make a couple of the antics less corny and suspension of disbelief is very much needed for when the women are disguised.\n\n&apos;Opernball&apos; is stunningly filmed in colour, with sumptuously elegant costumes and sets, while the music is still beautiful and tuneful and performed with liveliness and attractive tone. It&apos;s solidly directed too, and boasts fun and truly exuberant performances from the whole cast, from the young leads to the returning show-stealing antics of Hans Moser and Theo Lingen.\n\nIn conclusion, enjoyable and charming. Worth tracking down, both the 1939 and 1956 films as of now can be found in full on Youtube. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

I decided to watch it with high hopes as I am a big fan of the zombie genre and some reviewers compared it to Shaun of the dead and Zombieland. In my opinion however, there is no comparison, even when taking into consideration the far lower production costs of ZMD. There is no depth to any of the characters and I don&apos;t see how the acting can be viewed as anything more than up to par. The humour and satirical elements consist of easy one-liners which failed to even make me grin. I mean, come on : &quot;Don&apos;t shoot, I&apos;m gay&quot;. Is that even a joke ? If I was to compare this movie to anything I&apos;ve seen, I might consider Zombie strippers. However, Zombie strippers, at the very least, added a new original take to the genre and there was some much appreciated subtlety to the humour in the script. Furthermore, I&apos;ve seen Zombie strippers twice whereas I would never consider sitting through ZMD a second time. In all honesty, I feel generous in rating this movie with a 3/10.",

The second is the understand that this film was pieced together from scraps of film shot by various directors to fit in with footage that had been shot of Karloff on left over sets after the original feature had been finished. If you can forgive your favorite actors anything and accept that this is a paste up job, then you&apos;ll have yourself an okay time at the movies.\n\nLets face it this film is a mess. The story of a French soldier following a mysterious woman to a castle is so disjointed that they actually shot a scene where Jack Nicholson grabs one of the characters and asks him whats going on, its at that point all of the loose ends are brought together in a tenuous grip.\n\nIts the sort of movie that shouldn&apos;t work on any level but some how does.Its well acted considering that no one probably had any idea what they were starring in. Its also directed well enough that you don&apos;t realize that there were actually five directors other than Roger Corman behind the camera.\n\nCurrently floating around in the public domain (cheap video copies are to be had) this is a movie worth seeing if you want to see how Jack Nicholson started or how Boris Karloff ended up. Its a just okay thriller with a more interesting production history. Worth a bag of popcorn if you need another movie to fill out a night of Corman Poe movies.",

Oh and there are subhumanoids who are created and melt down with little of explanation, although the professor(Lisa Gaye) who sports a Marge Simpson haircut has a cure and being that Bronsky&apos;s girlfriend is a subhumanoid, he wants the cure. Of course education takes a backseat to non-stop bizarre set-pieces. Because last month was Halloween I did a non-stop binge on horror movies (AKA movies found in my horror section)and I saw this with the first. The first movie was made with gross out humor but also with restraint that things never got too out of control. Not so here, as Class Of Nukem High II is so bizarre and surreal that it&apos;s a non-stop assault on not only your senses but also your common sense and your physical being in general. You will not find a more weird film and yet I admit some of this went a long way, just not enough to be worth putting money down on. Reviewing this movie is hard because it&apos;s meant to be bizarre and there is tons of imagination and moments where the humor works but it&apos;s just so weird. And my taste in movies is hardly mainstream.\n\n** Out of 4-(Fair)",

      "reviewBody": "Certainly among the finest literary adaptations, &quot;The Heiress&quot; was based on Henry James&apos;s novel, &quot;Washington Square&quot; and features arguably Olivia de Havilland&apos;s finest screen performance. Morris Townsend , a handsome young man with ambiguous motives pursues Catherine Sloper, a plain spinster, who is slightly past marriageable age and possesses limited social skills. The young woman, who is the heiress of the title, is vulnerable prey for a penniless fortune hunter.\n\nHowever, Montgomery Clift plays Townsend in an enigmatic manner, and viewers can debate his true intentions. Catherine&apos;s father, played by Ralph Richardson, and her Aunt Lavinia, played by Miriam Hopkins, take opposite sides in Townsend&apos;s pursuit of Catherine. Although both her father and her aunt appear to see through the handsome suitor, Aunt Lavinia is practical and sensitive to her niece&apos;s emotional needs, and she counsels compromise in pursuit of happiness, if only fleeting. However, Catherine&apos;s father is unyielding and essentially unloving in his opposition to the match. Throughout, Dr. Sloper compares his daughter&apos;s virtues to those of his late wife, and Catherine comes up lacking in every quality that he values. Sloper threatens to disinherit his daughter if she marries the suitor.\n\nMontgomery Clift may appear shallow and transparent to some, but in essence those are the traits of his character. While Morris is slick and obviously fawning, he is not intelligent enough to be totally deceptive. Only someone as naive and needy as Olivia could fail to grasp that Morris may want something more than her love. Olivia de Havilland transcends her other performances and skillfully and convincingly evolves from a shy, introverted girl into a strong, vengeful woman. De Havilland has often portrayed women who appear genteel and soft on the outside, but whose hearts and backbones can harden into pure steel (e.g. Gone with the Wind; Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte), and Catherine Sloper is the finest of those roles. With able support from Richardson and Hopkins, Clift and de Havilland make the most of an outstanding screenplay, which was adapted from a stage play. William Wyler directs with a sure hand, and the atmospheric cinematography captures 19th century New York life. Period films are often unraveled by their hairstyles, which generally owe more to the year in which the film was made rather than that in which the story is set. However, even the coiffures excel in &quot;The Heiress.&quot; De Havilland&apos;s hair looks authentic 19th century and underscores Wyler&apos;s fastidious attention to detail.\n\nWith an award-winning de Havilland performance, a handsome Montgomery Clift on the brink of stardom, and an engrossing Henry James story, &quot;The Heiress&quot; is one of the finest films of the 1940&apos;s. Without qualification, the film holds up to and merits repeat viewings if only to better argue the underlying motives of Clift and the fateful decision that de Havilland has to make.",

Van Heflin&apos;s natural talent makes everything he does seem effortless.  Kirk Douglas offers a most impressive film debut in what, in retrospect, is an uncharacteristic role.  Lizabeth Scott (who seems to me a fascinating cross between Lauren Bacall and Rosemary Clooney) is constantly engaging.  Long after her part has faded, Scott&apos;s image remains indelibly fixed in the memory. And finally, the great Judith Anderson is on in a strong character role.\n\nMiklos Rozsa&apos;s compositional style is remarkable in its adaptablity.  Close one&apos;s eyes, and the film could well be set a thousand years earlier--or any point in between. Which is to say, it&apos;s general, while at the same time, specific. \n\nThe writing team headed by Robert Rossen created a slick and saucy script, which holds interest throughout, and Hal B. Wallis was sharp enough to retain this productional team formula for many years.  Were the film to have been given a perhaps more poetic--less Gothic--title, it might have enjoyed even greater stature in the annals of the genre.\n\nAs it is, &quot;Ivers&quot; is a worthy member of the noir film family.",

      "reviewBody": "The taxidermist Dr. Pablo Morales (Arturo de Córdova) is a good man that loves children and animals and to drink a few beers with his three best friends. He has been married for fifteen years with the wicked, frigid, cruel and manipulative self-righteous Gloria Morales (Amparo Rivelles), who has one leg with poliomyelitis, and turns his life into hell on Earth. She lies to the Priest Artemio Familiar (Antonio Bravo) and his nosy and gossipy neighbors and sister and brother-in-law from her congregation, telling them that Dr. Morales is an abusive man that beats her. Indeed, Dr. Morales loved her and has paid the mortgage of his old house where they live to please her and now is saving money to buy a camera that is his dream. When Gloria tries to poison his pet, their servant Meche (Rosenda Monteros), who treats Dr. Morales very nice, does not allow and is fired and expelled by Gloria. She tells her to leave the house immediately, otherwise she will accuse Meche of theft. When the seller reduces her commission to allow Dr. Morales to buy the camera, the object becomes his pride and joy. Soon Gloria breaks his camera into pieces and Dr. Morales kills her. How will he explain the absence of his wife?\n\n&quot;El esqueleto de la señora Morales&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Skeleton of Mrs. Morales&quot;, is a Mexican masterpiece of black humor. This film is a must-see for fans of this genre, since it is impossible to describe the cruel treatment of Gloria Morales to her husband. The viewer will certainly hope that he is considered not guilty in the trial. His confession to the nosy priest and the black humor in the end is very funny and unique. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Esqueleto da Sra. Morales&quot; (&quot;The Skeleton of Mrs. Morales&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Lars Von Trier was a notorious infant terriblé at his Danish film school, a mini Mussolini who felt compelled from an early age to drain the swamp of traditional Danish cinema with its age old reliance on &quot;folksy&quot; comedies. But twenty some years later he acknowledges his own foibles with this biting but sweet satire of film school machinations and the cement-headed teachers and state-employed film &quot;consultants&quot; that arbitrarily provide the funds and subsidies the small and always hard-pressed industry lives by here. But his alter ego, Erik is no cynical critic or ultra-ambitious manipulator, but instead a naive youth, unwilling or unable to conspire in order to get ahead - something Von Trier apparently never found distasteful or problematic. Von Trier has always been fueled by an ambiguity, his need to both elevate and castigate women, his knowledge of having to live in a world of fools and his remorse for his monumental sense of superiority. This need to have his cake and want to eat it too has caused him near paralytic depression at times, and this jolly film was a marvelous but brief elevator of his many mood swings. See it. Enjoy it. Though not directed by Von Trier, the film&apos;s production values are superb. Film students will love this film as they will think Von Trier is describing everyone in their world but them.",

Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. However, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water.\n\n&quot;Black Water&quot; is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning, based on a true event. The acting of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is top-notch, giving credibility to this simple but scary story. There are many similarities between this movie and &quot;Prey&quot;, but in different environments. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Medo Profundo&quot; (&quot;Deep Fear&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Yes I know, its a movie about the world of amateur singers and the disparate personalities that flock from around the country to win the big jackpot. If you are reading this then chances are that you have already seen the movie so there is no need to rehash it now. The one thing that I truly enjoyed, however, was the absolutely believable friendship that develops between the characters of Todd Woods and Reggie Kane. Sure, there are other good aspects of this movie, such as surprisingly good acting from Huey Lewis and a very low key, quirky representation of his daughter, played by Gwenneth Paltrow. This movie didn&apos;t enchant the critics upon its release...and judging by its box office performance, not much of the country either...but there is something very sublime about, not only the subject matter, but also the method in which this movies elements were pieced together...much like a dramatic jigsaw puzzle. What really made this movie special for me though was the ending. Reggie Kane&apos;s final performance and the aftermath...especially with regards to Todd&apos;s wife, almost made me weep. I found it very moving and genuine in its execution, and the low-key nature if the acting simply enhanced those qualities. So, to sum up: mediocre movie that has some really great nuances that combine to make a movie that, though slow and draggy at times, makes up for those lapses with the end results. P.S. as usual, Paul Giamatti is perfect! Everything that he gets involved with...with the possible exception of that &quot;re-envisioned&quot; Planet of the Apes...ALWAYS is made better by his presence!",

      "reviewBody": "John Carpenter&apos;s masterpiece about a priest enlisting the help of a physics professor and his students in preventing the coming of the Anti-God. Yep, I said masterpiece. I consider this to be Carpenter&apos;s crowning achievement. Said priest (played by the impeccable Donald Pleasance) discovers a large vat of green fluid in the basement of an old church near downtown Los Angeles. He comes to realize that the liquid in the container is the very essence of Satan himself, and that a sect known as &quot;The Brotherhood of Sleep&quot; has kept it a secret all these years. The secret can no longer be kept, however, as the apocalypse is brewing and the vat of liquid Satan is the over-sized coffee pot.\n\nCarpenter really struck gold with the script for Prince of Darkness. I find it to be Carpenter&apos;s most intelligent and thought-provoking. I love all of the theoretical, scientific and religious discussion in this film. He takes all of these wonderful ideas and forms them into one of the most intriguing story lines the genre has ever seen. It all makes for a very engaging viewing experience, especially if this sort of material fascinates you as much as it does me.\n\nThe film is slow-burning, yet intensely unnerving. The overall mood, the creepy street people, the church itself and the eerie occurrences caused by the Anti-God&apos;s growing power all make for an unsettling watch. Perhaps the most effective scene in the film for me is Wyndham saying hello in that garbled voice followed by &quot;Pray for death.&quot; I also must make mention of the recurring dream projections via tachyons. A brilliant idea that adds an even deeper level to the film&apos;s frightening nature. The imagery in these dreams is truly the stuff nightmares are made of!\n\nAs far as the cast goes, this is my favorite ensemble in a Carpenter film, even more so than the one we get in The Thing. They all do fine jobs, especially Pleasance and Victor Wong. I love the interaction between these two. I also really enjoy Jameson Parker in the lead, and Dennis Dun is the rare case of comedy relief that actually works. He is amusing, likable, and his antics don&apos;t overshadow or ruin the mood that the film has built up.\n\nThe atmosphere? Perfect. So is the dread-inducing score, which is an uncanny fit for the material. In the same way that I see Prince of Darkness as Carpenter&apos;s best film, the haunting music throughout makes for his best work as a composer. I love the score as much as I love the film itself. The sense of hopeless isolation Carpenter is able to convey despite the church being in L.A. is yet another impressive accomplishment in a film that never fails to impress.\n\nDefinitely an underrated classic. Carpenter&apos;s wonderful ideas are realized to fascinating effect in the film, and for me, the execution is flawless. It&apos;s a rare case when I have nothing bad to say about a movie, but this is one of those instances. The music, the atmosphere, the apocalyptic tone, the marvelous ending... it all works beautifully. It&apos;s a gem that Carpenter has never bettered. I&apos;m in the minority regarding that statement, but I&apos;m sticking to it."

      "reviewBody": "In 1964, this was the first cinema movie of Michael Pfleghar who is mostly known as a director of TV series such as &apos;Klimbim&apos;. It is a rather anarchic movie, shot partly at Hollywood without any official permits, I presume, because there are passers-by staring into the camera, wondering what that foreign film crew is doing in the middle of the street.\n\nThe &apos;Dead Woman of Beverly Hills&apos; is Lu Sostlov (Heidelinde Weis) whose body is found at the beginning of the movie. Many flashbacks to the past (which are in colour, opposed to the black &amp; white scenes in the present) reveal step by step how Lu caused chaos in the feelings of several men she fell in love with. One of them probably killed her in jealousy, but who? The excellent cast includes Horst Frank, Klausjürgen Wussow, Alice &amp; Ellen Kessler and Ernst Fritz Fürbringer. It&apos;s a comedy not without tragical ingredients, rather weird and not a movie for everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie&quot; is a film that has to be seen to be disbelieved. The first film, 1995&apos;s &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, brought the six butt-kicking teens from the Fox Kids series to the big screen for the first time. That movie was not all that bad. It had some decent special effects, a somewhat interesting bad guy (Ivan Ooze), and the six young actors who play the Power Rangers were fun to watch. Plus, that film had a bigger budget. But they went back to the cheapness of the TV show with &quot;Turbo&quot;. The special effects, production design, and costumes are so cheap and cheesy that you wonder why 20th Century Fox gave the go-ahead to let these filmmakers (who are close to the TV show) make this film. Also, the script is much worse than it was in the first movie. Bulk and Skull have more screen time here. It has one of the least interesting villains of all time (actually, a villainess). It&apos;s very, very, very, very, very, juvenile. And the Power Ranger actors look as if they want to escape this atrosity. So I have one question. Why did they release this movie to theaters? This should have been released straight to video. Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place. This movie was totally inappropriate for the big screen. \n\n* (out of four)",

Now, imagine that your great-grandfather was the president of the country and you want to make a film about him. What do you do? The only thing you have are some old audio tapes where the president&apos;s daughter tries, not very successfully, to remember and portrait her father, and you don&apos;t really have any of the privileged access that one would assume for being a part of the family. This is the challenge that Natalia Almada had to face for this film.\n\nAlmada approaches the problem with grace and intelligence. More filled with questions than answers, the director tries to look at the past, as much as possible: she includes a good amount of historical footage, looks at period newspapers, and gets the most of the old tapes. But she also is at all times looking at the present, exploring the fascinating carnival and chaos that Mexico city is today. For some strange reason, the two lines of the documentary, the past and the present, although almost belonging to two different movies, end up matching quite well. It is the magic of film, or at least, of Almada&apos;s film.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a surprise - and no surprise - to discover that this single documentary about the Nazi genocide of the Sinti and Roma hasn&apos;t had any reviews yet. Although - or more likely because - the ongoing persecution of the Roma, which has much worsened during the CoVid pandemic, proves that all those social justice debates of the past decade are pure hypocrisy, at least as far as Europe is concerned.\n\nYeger&apos;s film starts out with the question that many Jews researching the Holocaust are eventually confronted with: with such an abundance of material, why has the Romani genocide remained so elusive compared to the Shoah? He interviews many survivors, like Celja Stojka whose Auschwitz paintings and lectures made her a celebrity in her native Austria. There is a long overdue bit on Mengele&apos;s &quot;Kindergarten&quot; where he collected Romani children to conduct experiments on them, as he was obsessed with the racial &quot;anomaly&quot; the Roma represented for Nazi race theory (descending from India, they are pure Aryan). The witness testimony of these &quot;experiments&quot; are the toughest part of the film and not for the faint of heart.\n\nHowever, Yeger fails to address (or comprehend) the main reasons for the comparative lack of Romani testimonials: for one part, Roma could not emigrate to Israel, so they continue to live among those who oppress them. Also, the Roma avoid talking about the dead for cultural reasons, which made it easier to ignore them. Finally, the Nazis killed 80-90% of them in Germany, so there are simply not enough left to raise the issue in a major way.\n\nMany of the interview partners are famous scholars and it would have been helpful to point out who, for instance, Ian Hancock is (he established the Romani term for the Holocaust &quot;porajmos&quot;, meaning &quot;The Devouring&quot;). And at 99 minutes the film is much too short given the enormous scope of the subject. One could easily do an entire series on this. Roma have a substantially different view of Europe than the &quot;gadje&quot; (i.e. Everybody else), which would be important and fascinating to learn. Yet, as the view count and votes show, even a comprehensive first look at the Nazi persecution of Roma has failed to garner much interest.",

I must say it seemed as a B-movie in the beginning, but as the movie went on, it only got better and better. Something else that was fun is Michael J. Fox&apos;s appearance in the movie. Great scene. A must see!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Freedomland&quot; will not be a popular movie. The movie doesn&apos;t have enough action and the action is does contain is more to promote a message than to titillate. Its message is basically about inner city racism. Its about the fuss made over a missing white child in a black community. The story is about a white women who was car-jacked in a housing project and, unknown to the jacker, her 4 year old son was in the car&apos;s back seat. You&apos;ll have to see the movie to see the rest since revealing the story would completely ruin the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the performances by Samuel Jackson, William Forsythe and Ron Eldard were realistic and affecting. One standout was Edie Falco. She played a very unglamorous role and was powerfully affecting. She should get an Academy Award nomination for this role. She was fabulous. Another standout was Julianne Moore who was very miscast. I did not like her in this role. She played a very weak, flawed and emotionally stunted individual whose behavior at times turned my stomach. I did not like the character. The character was not written to be liked, maybe pitied and I think that aspect is what Ms. Moore was trying to evoke. I think she did too good a job at making her character weak and flawed and missed a toughness that the book&apos;s character had. To live in the environment that she did she would have acquired more emotional survival skills than the movie&apos;s character portrayed. Ms. Moore&apos;s character looked like she wandered onto the set from a suburban mall. Her looks and demeanor next to the strong Black women characters made her appear too weak and her obstinacy appears to be more stupidity. I think Edie Falco could have played this role better with her strength and then the revelations and breakdown when the toughness crumbled would have been more effective. The movie is unfortunately being advertised as a thriller and audiences expecting action and things blowing up will be disappointed. &quot;Freedomland&quot; is one of those movies that Hollywood doesn&apos;t get or know what to do with but it is a very worthwhile movie to see. I gave it a 7 out 10. I downgraded it slightly because of Ms. Moore&apos;s performance.",

      "reviewBody": "The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have herds of American Bison as large as some of our largest cities. By the time of the period The Last Hunt is set in, the buffalo had been all but wiped out. The 20th century, due to the efforts of conservationists, saw a revival in population of the species, but not hardly like it once was.\n\nRobert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to All the Brothers Were Valiant. Here Stewart Granger is the good guy, a world weary buffalo hunter, who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations.\n\nThe partner he&apos;s chosen to throw in with is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for the moment, I doubt if there&apos;s ever been a meaner, nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen who Taylor portrays. In Devil&apos;s Doorway he was an American Indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he&apos;s the racist here. He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills one Indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive. Like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of Debra Paget&apos;s sexual favors. He&apos;s actually mad when Paget doesn&apos;t see it that way.\n\nNo matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a halfbreed, I was never really convinced he was any part Indian. It&apos;s the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt.\n\nHowever Lloyd Nolan, the grizzled old buffalo skinner Taylor and Granger bring along is just great. Nolan steals every scene he&apos;s in with the cast. \n\nFor those who like their westerns real, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen, and who don&apos;t like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.",

      "reviewBody": "Throne of Blood is an epic historical drama by renowned director Kurosawa Akira and with charismatic lead actor Mifune Toshiro. The plot revolves around betrayal, conspiracy, greed, honour and megalomania. It is inspired by William Shakespeare&apos;s Macbeth intertwined with stylistic elements from Japanese Noh which is a visually appealing but physically static type of traditional musical drama.\n\nThe movie tells the story of friends and generals Washizu and Miki who are foretold a bright future by a mysterious spirit in a misty forest. Initially skeptical, the prophecies of the spirit happen to be true when Washizu is named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki Commander of the First Fortress. However, Washizu&apos;s cold-blooded wife Asaji manipulates her husband into forcing his luck instead of waiting for it to fall into his hands. They plot to assassinate Lord Tsuzuki and then kill Miki but their gloomy plans soon backfire and spiral out of control.\n\nThe movie convinces with gorgeous settings such as gigantic Spider&apos;s Web Castle. The acting performances are really intense and especially Yamada Isuzu convinces as sinister femme fatale. The plot is filled with interesting conspiracies, intrigues and twists. The film&apos;s pace is relatively steady after a slow but necessary introduction. The final quarter of the movie is particularly intense and ends in a brutal tragedy. The movie has aged rather well thanks to its timeless plot.\n\nThis movie isn&apos;t among Kurosawa Akira&apos;s greatest films like Seven Samurai and The Hidden Fortress but is still in the upper middle section of his impressive works. This dynamic historical drama is a clever take on William Shakespeare&apos;s timeless Macbeth and convinces thanks to stunning settings, gloomy atmosphere and intense acting performances. If you like elegant action films, intense dramas or epic war movies, you will certainly appreciate Throne of Blood. This entertaining movie has aged quite well and would serve as an appropriate introduction to the works of both Kurosawa Akira and Mifune Toshiro.",

It had some funny parts, mainly targeted for younger kids. I have always loved the original series from the 60&apos;s. I was pretty disappointed with the other Scooby Doo movies earlier in 2003. The other Cartoon Network one from 2009 was also good. The plot, although not original, still has refreshing parts. I really advise anyone who loved the series as a child. If you only liked the original series and would hat to watch this, then don&apos;t. I thought this was a good movie for a Saturday night.",

      "reviewBody": "In an attempt to get the US Government to pay for soldiers lost on secret missions General Hummel and a group of soldiers steal biological weapons and take control of Alcatraz, threatening to launch on San Francisco if their demands are not met.  Running out of options the FBI take Mason out of prison as he has a knowledge of the island, being the only man to have escaped from there.  Mason and bio-chemical expert Goodspeed join a group of Navy SEALS to enter the island and destroy the weapons before they can be used.  However the death of the whole SEAL unit leaves Mason and Goodspeed to use stealth to avoid the terrorists and destroy the weapons.\n\nThis is nothing more than a big summer blockbuster that relies on plenty of big bangs to get it&apos;s audience.  It relies on the usual Die Hard set-up of &quot;one man (2 men!) take on heavily armed group in set location&quot;.  However here the plot is a little iffy - Hummel isn&apos;t a terrorist, in fact his stance is almost sympathetic.  This makes it all a little funny morally but the film turns it round at one point to go back into traditional good guy/bad guy roles so that the audience don&apos;t start to think too much!  The action is very good - plenty of bangs for your buck!  Even though it&apos;s all pretty OTT (like the car chase at the start) the mood of the film is such that it&apos;s all a great deal of fun.\n\nConnery is really good in the lead and is funny and rather dashing!  Cage&apos;s character is not as good and is too weedy at the start and some of his dialogue is grating.  The support cast is deep and really good - usually big budget action movies have some well known support actors but this has tonnes!  Check the names - Ed Harris, David Morse, John Spencer, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn, John C. McGinley, Bokeem Woodbine - the list goes on!\n\nOverall, if you hate big, dumb summer movies then you&apos;ll hate this.  I&apos;m split down the middle but the sheer sense of fun that this brings combined with a great cast makes this a winner in my book!"

The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn&apos;t arrive to be an abuse of it.\n\nIf you can see it don&apos;t loose your time with Hollywood sad-bad thrillers bet for this Korean present.\n\n9/10 cause perfection doesn&apos;t exist.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film years ago as part of the Seattle International Film Festival or SIFF as we call it. I went because it was a Dutch film, not knowing anything about it, and enjoyed it tremendously.\n\nIt was slow paced, which I enjoyed it for, without a lot of &quot;plot&quot;...something I have read it has received a lot of criticism for. I would argue that the plot may not be big, but it is deep and allowed you the room to think (ponder if you will).\n\nThe story is ultimately about a father-son relationship. The father is very taciturn and the owner/coach at a local boxing gym. His son is different. This causes some friction between the two. Machismo means everything to the one...while probably nothing to the other. That is a complex relationship. Love, protection, fear, hatred, hurt, anger...there is a lot in this film. Told almost entirely through expressions with very little dialogue, which didn&apos;t bother me because they are guys! How many guys do you know who are good about expressing their emotions and fears? Especially to other guys? This seemed natural and organic.\n\nThe best part of the film was the cinematography. I felt like this was a gorgeous summer postcard to Amsterdam-North which is separated from the bustling city by a river giving it a small town feel in a big city. So watch it for nothing else but that...and I think you will enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "Die drei von der Tankstelle is a good example for the quality of the UFA movies in the times before 1933, the year German film was taken over by the nazis and deprived of major talent. The fluffy story can be told in a sentence: a rich girl can&apos;t decide between three young men from a gas station, but soon she makes up her mind and has to convince her chosen one that she really means it. Apart from the dream team Harvey-Fritsch, the most popular movie couple in German film history, the other parts are also played by excellent and interesting actors: Heinz Rühmann, who later became Germany&apos;s leading male star, Austrian Oskar Karlweis, who emigrated to Hollywood just like Felix Bressart of &quot;Ninotchka&quot; and &quot;To Be and Not To Be&quot; fame. Kurt Gerron, who plays the lawyer was later killed in a concentration camp after the nazis blackmailed him into making a propaganda movie about the camp Theresienstadt. The music is quite catchy and Mrs. Harvey really sparkles in the main part. She was truly one of the first major European sound film stars, being fluent in English, French and German. The restored version is still not quite perfect in its picture quality, but for me this just adds to the nostalgic touch.",

The story is actually quite limited, but M. Pollock and his wife both make an interesting pair of monsters and a frighteningly believable couple, and the movie&apos;s four-handed structure pits them nicely against the model pairing of the hero and his wife. Ultimately, it might have been better had the lemmings of the title seemed more connected to the meat of the story; but the acting is good, even if the hero is just a little too reserved for us to really feel his angst.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Giorgio Ferroni had a long career in Italian cinema, back to the 1930s. He was at the peak of his art by 1961, having a previous commercial success with &quot;Mill of the Stone Women&quot;. He took great care and there were no financial limitations for his adaptation of Euripides&apos; classic tragedy &quot;The Bacchantes&quot;, including location shooting in Greece for the opening dance sequence in panoramic exteriors, and the hiring of popular foreign talents, as Finnish actress-dancer Taina Elg as Dirce (though admittedly her Hollywood career was starting to decline by 1961, even after winning a Golden Globe for &quot;Les Girls&quot;), French actor Pierre Brice for the role of Dionisos/Dionysus, Russian actor Akim Tamiroff as Tiresias, and the American choreographer Herbert Ross, long before becoming a film director. The prestige of the artistic personnel was rounded with Italian artists, including composer Mario Nascimbene and actors Alberto Lupo and Miranda Campa as the son and mother rulers of Thebes. Welcome liberties were taken in adapting the tragedy, considered by many scholars as Euripides&apos; greatest stage work, whose open call to hedonism was more than relevant for the decade of &quot;free love&quot;, as it is still pertinent today. But its stage origin is strong: the film remains a verbose product, with dialogs delivered in a too theatrical manner (especially by Dionisos), and the film ends being perceived as longer than its actual running time. Inexplicably Brice wears an ugly platinum wig, his Dionisos is tamed and stiff, compared to the exuberant descriptions of the god in art; and the only bacchanal depicted is too restrained and chaste even by 1961 film conventions. All this said I find it a work of enough merit to deserve better appreciation. To call this &quot;sword and sandal&quot; (a simplistic renaming of the more accurate -and appealing- &quot;peplum&quot; term, for a sub-genre that quite often includes little clothing, sexy women, sadist rulers and masochist demigods), or re-issuing it as &quot;Bondage Gladiator Sexy&quot;, illustrates the tendency to mix expressions with artistic intentions (if partly failed as this) with fast-buck productions, exploiting the success of the most recent strong-man release. Curiously, after &quot;Le baccanti&quot;, the term would be more justified for the several peplums Ferroni made.",

      "reviewBody": "Occasionally a film about which you know nothing comes along and knocks you down. This is even more remarkable when it is 30 years old. It is what in Poland they call a polkownik or &apos;shelf movie&apos;, that is to say a film that was so explosive it had to be put on a shelf and not shown. Bugajski made Interrogation/Przesluchanie in Poland in 1982 and finished principal photography a week before martial law was declared. He then buried the film, literally, in order to keep it from being destroyed. With the end of Polish Communism it resurfaced in 1989, being premiered in the UK in 1990, and was the official Polish entry at Cannes in 1990. The story is compelling: in 1951 a young woman, Tonia Dziwisz, is arrested when she is drunk, and thrown into prison where the UBeks, a major and Lieutenant Morawski, try to force her to spill the beans on Olcha, a war resistance hero she had slept with, in a way that would condemn him to death, regardless of whether what she said was true or false. But it is not just the story that compels, but the way it is made. Much of it is in close-up, a style I am normally wary of, but Bugajski uses it to convey the visceral nature of mental and physical torture. There are some medium shots in the film, and towards the end a long shot is used to convey how distant the outside world has become. But mostly we see the faces of both victims and torturers wrestling with inner demons. Is it true? Yes. It starts in Arthur Koestler&apos;s Darkness at Noon territory, and develops into a cat-and-mouse psychological thriller. I think fiction takes over here, but it only shows how fiction is more powerful and more true than fact. I never have nightmares, but this film gave me one. Highly recommended.",

I heard about him inheriting the role from Harrison Ford for some reason, but my first choice would have been to go back to Alec Baldwin, who did an excellent job in the Hunt for Red October.  Morgan Freeman, usually brilliant, also seems to be thrown into this movie incorrectly.  The story was convincing, but again star power doesn&apos;t necessarily translate into great story telling.  Let Ben continue to do the romantic comedies and action movies, but leave the strong serial characters to someone who can truly embody the role."

The resulting mayhem and farcical runnings about inevitably turn pompous prigs into quivering jellies, to the roaring amusement of Brit audiences who lived their lives under the heel of such petty authorities and loved to watch them taken down. \n\nCarry on Nurse, with its casual snipes at the Public Health, zany ward carryings on after hours by bored neglected patients fed up with their authoritarian Matron (Hattie Jacques, in her first of more than a dozen appearances as this familiar type) and fighting back in a series of anarchic stunts, shows the Carry On formula in ready-made form and is an excellent starting point for new viewers.",

The point isn&apos;t linguistic accuracy, or any other kind of &quot;accuracy&quot; but rather the theme and motifs. In 1348 a frightening &quot;illness&quot; swept Europe, killing thousands. People didn&apos;t understand what caused the illness, only that it offered a horrifying death. This movie is as much a critique of &quot;christendom&quot; as it is of contemporary politics. If the US nuclear submarine is for some too clumsy an analogy to the black death, imagine the fall out of nuclear bombing as analogous to the black death. The pervasive silent killer. This movie was fantastic, for its imaginative plot, the interesting motifs and imagery, the concept of a small boy&apos;s vision, and the possible universes.",

It does have an inspiring theme when you reflect upon Cora&apos;s move in the story.

However, many of the people that has given the film such bad reviews seems to be the same danish guy over and over again. I cannot be a coincidence that several guys with danish sounding usernames have commented on the same movies in quite a number of incarnations.\n\nThe claim made by most critics is that the US government has high morals enough not to kill any of its own citizens. Even though many thousands US soldiers died in WW2, 58 000 US troops died in Vietnam, a number of US troops are still dying in Afghanistan and Iraq as we speak.\n\nThese are people, human beings, US citizens that dies because of decisions made by the US government. Inevitable you might say, but nothing is inevitable. Ever.\n\nThere are endless records where governments deceive their own population in order to mass support behind a war. It has been true in Nazi-Germany, in the U.K., in France during WW2, in Rwanda, Congo, Burma/Myanmar...\n\nCheck out Operation Northwoods and make up your own mind. It&apos;s on Wikipedia. Check out Operation Ajax, the CIA assisted coup in Chile 1973, the Iran-Contras deal, Nurse Nayirah in Gulf War I, the genocide that didn&apos;t take place in former Yugoslavia.\n\nAll which directly or indirectly have taken American lives. Do not think that you are spared.\n\nAs far as the movie goes, it is poorly referenced, some of the truths told are complete nonsense or exaggerations, but there are still things that DO NOT ADD UP in the official story.\n\nI hope that you will watch this movie and make up your own mind. We learn from history that we have not learned from history. Sometimes the ignorance must stop, even in the greatest democracy of them all, selfrighteous pads on the back or not.",

      "reviewBody": "The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend--make that client--Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small New York apartment, with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms. When Jim&apos;s wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, advertising exec Jim falls in love with (or falls for!) an ad for a house. Once he&apos;s purchased the house, bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of Jim&apos;s &apos;dream house&apos; goes wrong.\n\nOne of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy--not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel. The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that&apos;s just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role (it&apos;s evident that Grant&apos;s character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel a colour, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note.\n\nOne of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the &apos;store room&apos;, and Jim goes to &apos;save&apos; him... only to get everyone trapped inside! Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for &apos;Wham&apos;--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch. 8/10",

His plan is to use the blood of one of his human female patients to transfuse into the ape and turn her into a beautiful young woman (played by Acquanetta). The typical problem is that the ape tendencies keep on creeping back. This performer Acquanetta made several other films after this one, but she was always a terrible actress whenever she opened her mouth to speak a line. However, she pulls off the role as a human with primitive origins fairly well enough here by keeping mute and using her eyes and limited facial expressions. Sometimes things get a bit bogged down by an over-reliance on animal stock footage from THE BIG CAGE, but the presence of Carradine&apos;s mad doctor and a different breed of &quot;girl monster&quot; keep this a serviceable entry in Universal&apos;s horror series. **1/2 out of ****",
