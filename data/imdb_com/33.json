      "reviewBody": "I found &quot;Hell&apos;s Angels on Wheels&quot; on a disc containing three Jack Nicholson films. However, the print quality on &quot;Jack Nicholson: Cult Classics&quot; was pretty bad and I assume there must be better quality prints available somewhere--especially since at least two of the films (perhaps all three) are widely available from many different distributors.\n\nThe plot of &quot;Hell&apos;s Angels on Wheels&quot; is amazingly slim and it looks as if most of the movie was unscripted and the filmmakers just filmed these folks doing all kids of things--some illegal, some just annoying. At one point, an angry young guy (Nicholson) gets in good with the gang and is soon allowed to ride with them. During the course of the film there are quite a few fights and a lot of making out--though the level of violence and amount of skin you see is very, very limited and the film is pretty tame compared to some of the latter biker films. Now this isn&apos;t to say it&apos;s a family film--as there are a couple murders along the way. As for Nicholson, eventually he gets tired of the scene and it ends with a face-off with the leader of the pack. How it all ends is really stupid--so stupid you need to see it to believe it.\n\n&quot;Hell&apos;s Angels on Wheels&quot; isn&apos;t a very good film but it is watchable. Directionless much of the time, of course, but oddly compelling in a voyeuristic sort of way. An odd glimpse into the 1960s, that&apos;s for sure and definitely NOT a film for the average viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "NOTHING BUT TROUBLE (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1944), directed by Sam Taylor, stars the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in a movie title that best described their style of comedy - nothing but trouble. For their final feature for MGM, and on loan from their current home base of 20th Century-Fox, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE may not come close to the style of comedies the team did best while under Hal Roach/MGM in the 1930s, but at least it is a slight improvement over their recent disappointing comedies they were doing at that time. Compare to the Chevy Chase 1991 edition to NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, this Laurel and Hardy edition is a comedy masterpiece.\n\nCombining two stories that would eventually come together as one, the opening starts with Laurel and Hardy with a prologue set during the Depression era of 1932 &quot;when jobs were as hard to find as a girdle on a welder.&quot; Stanley and Oliver come to the Lorrison Employee Agency where they wait on long lines looking for employment as chef and butler. Without any luck, they come to the decision of going elsewhere, overseas as to France, Italy and Japan where Oliver attempts to showcase his steak a la Oliver, but with no success. Twelve years later, 1944, &quot;where jobs were as easy to find as a girdle on a welder,&quot; Stan and Ollie return to the United States where their wait among the crowds at the Lorrison Employee Agency is no different as it was in 1932. They do, however, get hired by Mrs. Elvira Hawkley (Mary Boland), a society woman looking for a cook and a butler to help prepare dinner for a visiting king and his uncle. The second story focuses on Christopher (David Leland), a teenage boy king from Orlandra accompanied by his uncle, Prince Saul (Philip Merivale) visiting the United States. Chris, who would like nothing more than to be like any other boy his age by going out freely and playing football. He is unaware that his uncle is arranging to have him accidently killed off so to place the blame on his political opponent. While walking in the park with his secretary, Roentz (John Warburton), who is in on the assassination attempt, Chris unwittingly disappears to play football with the other boys. Because the team needs referees, Chris talks Laurel and Hardy, returning home with groceries, to assist in the game. Because Oliver forgot to buy the main course meal of steak, Chris helps the twosome obtain a great piece from a lion&apos;s cage at the zoo. Upon their return to the mansion where Oliver prepares his steak a la Oliver, he and Stan find Chris hiding in the kitchen. Following the dinner where Mrs. Harkley and her husband (Henry O&apos;Neill) entertain Chris&apos;s uncle, Prince Saul, Mrs. Harkley discovers Chris running from under the table, mistaking him for a street urchin. Laurel and Hardy get fired when Mrs. Harkley find the boy associated with them. Further trouble lies ahead when Stan and Ollie are accused and arrested for Chris&apos;s abduction, and more trouble when they learn what Chris&apos;s uncle intends to do with the boy.\n\nOthers in the cast include: Matthew Boulton (Prince Prentiloff); Connie Gilchrist (Mrs. Flanagan); Robert Emmett O&apos;Connor, Paul Porcasi, Robert E. Homans, Chester Clute and Joe Yule. Surprisingly, David Leland, in his only major role as the teenage boy king, and few movie roles to his credit, had died at the age of 16 in 1948. One wonders had he lived, would he had been MGM&apos;s answer to popular European imports as the British Freddie Bartholomew of the 1930s or 20th Century-Fox&apos;s Roddy McDowall of the 1940s.\n\nNot quite up to the current comedies by Abbott and Costello, who make Laurel and Hardy seem to be a comedy team of the past, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE is a typical mix of sentiment and humor in the MGM mode. NOTHING BUT TROUBLE includes some amusing bits such as Oliver&apos;s attempt in cutting the steak at the dinner table. The climatic window ledge sequence which comes reminiscent to the Harold Lloyd comedies of the 1920s, should have been a height of hilarity, but comes off forced and silly. Mary Boland is amusing as always, but one cannot help but wonder how that same role might have been pulled off had the deadpan Margaret Dumont, a popular foil in Marx Brothers comedies, been handled. For its 70 minutes, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE is often accepted as one of Stan and Ollie&apos;s finer comedies of the 1940s, especially by devotees of their work. (** steaks)",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a circus, but you don&apos;t need an admission ticket. You can even peek in from the street and catch all the antics on your way to work. It&apos;s Ruth and Eileen&apos;s sub-level flat, and rents for only $48 a month with open grillwork onto a chaotic Greenwich Village street scene. Are these two ambitious Mid-western sisters ready for a pro-football player who sleeps over, a fast-talking landlord who paints like a Dodo bird, and a mysterious stranger who walks in and refuses to leave, Then there&apos;s the battalion of Portuguese naval cadets who mistake the flat for a dance studio. It&apos;s all part of this wacky, fast-paced take on Life in the Big City.\n\nIt&apos;s all good, innocent fun of course with a tempo that seldom falters, and when things do slow, there&apos;s always an underground jolt to mix it up again. Naturally, Rosalind Russell as the caustic older sister gets all the good throw-away lines, while Janet Blair as Eileen gets all the wolf whistles. Then there&apos;s the assorted characters-- Gordon Jone&apos;s trademark good-natured galoot, George Tobias&apos; fractured ethnic type, and Chick Chandler&apos;s silent stranger more creepy than humorous. And, of course, no urban scene of the day would be complete without the bulldog-face of Donald McBride as the ever cranky cop. Together, they turn the flat into a stopover on the way to the funny farm. I expect more than a few Mid-Westerners packed up for New York hoping to get a share of madcap city life.\n\nOn a more serious note, the movie was made at a time when the &quot;common touch&quot; was being celebrated in popular culture. After all, it would take a combined national effort to defeat the Axis powers. So, it&apos;s not surprising that many movies celebrated the America of the &quot;melting pot&quot;, complete with ethnic types, blue-collar characters, and frequent references to Brooklyn, the symbol of the melding.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s still a fun movie even if some skits do strain a bit. I guess the moral is that no city is too big for the talented. And especially, for the shapely. Then too, make sure to stick around for a very last scene that could not be more inspired or appropriate."

      "reviewBody": "This film was made right at the birth of the New Wave, in the same year as Chabrol&apos;s second film, the seminal New Wave missile Les Cousins (incidentally Le Signe de Lion was produced by Chabrol), and Truffaut&apos;s first big knockout blow, the 400 blows. Godard was only to get his act together in the following year, 1960, with Breathless. \n\nTo me this is a masterpiece cut from the same cloth. There are glimpses of mysticism in Rohmer&apos;s film The Green Ray, but really this film takes that a lot further, it&apos;s a movie that really plays around with chance and fortune. Pierre Wesselrin, of Germano-American origin, is a small-time Parisian composer who has never made a cent out of his music. He talks a lot about having been lucky all his life, and he is, he&apos;s fallen in with a crowd of rich friends and he&apos;s always bathed in rive gauche society, even though he&apos;s not a great talent and is very lazy, he seems to be able to get people to give him money. There&apos;s a very Rivettian feel to the start of the movie, Wesselrin throws a party and you have, for example, this guy who is indoors at nighttime wearing dark glasses, he&apos;s listening to this febrile, screeching section of some classical music over and over again, repeatedly bringing back the needle of the record player. There&apos;s these little throwaway poetical typically French sophistries where they talk allegorically about Venus, and a woman says that no-one lives there because it&apos;s too close to the sun, it&apos;s good but I&apos;m sure it sounds better in a marijuana haze. \n\nSo I don&apos;t want to give too much of the plot away, but there ends up being a lot of solitary wandering about Paris. I thought the ultimate poetic vision of Paris was Rivette&apos;s Paris Belongs To Us, but this is up there on that level. Rohmer somehow makes Paris feel like a giant coffin, or a kind of Byzantine, encrusted, cemetery. \n\nThere&apos;s the traditional view of this film which concerns the perils of believing in one&apos;s good fortunes, but I think on the whole it&apos;s far more mystical, really pointing at Wesslrin&apos;s life being ruled by the stars. It&apos;s just gorgeous as well. They must have built the walkways along the Seine when people believed in Arcadia, which they don&apos;t anymore. The photography just blows me away, favourites being Wesselrin in a floppy hat singing by the Seine, and his violin sonata played at the start of the film as the camera glides over the Seine. \n\nThere&apos;s a critical idea with this movie about the perils of entrusting your fate to luck. I don&apos;t follow that one bit. My reading is that Wesselrin is lucky throughout the movie, in fact his experiences are what enable him to finally finish his violin sonata, and also to appreciate his lucky situation in life. He reminds me of Tartini, a composer who is famous for only one work, The Devil&apos;s Trill, a violin sonata which he heard in his dreams (supposedly he saw the Devil playing), and then transcribed upon awaking.\n\nI really felt like screaming after I had finished watching this at quarter to one in the morning, I think I got a few strangled gurgles out, would not have been good to wake the house up. This is why I watch cinema, for the feeling of ecstasy (ec - stasy, literally out of stasis).\n\nA friend pointed out to me that many of Rohmer&apos;s later trademarks are present in this film, &quot;the seemingly artless but carefully constructed mise-en-scène&quot;. I like to refer to his mise-en-scène as situational, he often does scenes that remind me of the bit in Meshes of the afternoon when a mystical hand lowers a sunflower. It&apos;s almost like their are supernatural beings placing objects to be found by the participants in the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Francois Mauriac&apos;s novel of 1927 is a scathing indictment of the bougeoisie, especially its obsession with avoiding scandal, keeping up appearances and maintaining the status quo. Therese marries into the Desqueyroux family but in her relationship with husband Bernard from the outset there is evidently something missing. She fulfils her wifely duty by giving birth but this is no consolation and her subsequent actions are both drastic and devastating. Even she cannot explain what brings her to do what she does and in one of her internal monologues refers to &apos;a deranged power&apos; within her. Her character is one of the most enigmatic in the history of literature and who better to play her than Emmanuelle Riva. This sensitive, intelligent and ethereal actress had entered films with a miniscular role as Jean Gabin&apos;s secretary in &apos;Grande Familles&apos; and within a year took the world by storm in &apos;Hiroshima, mon Amour&apos; for which she was nominated for a BAFTA. She came full circle half a century later by winning it for her sensational performance in &apos;Amour&apos;. Bernard, the boorish husband, is played by Philippe Noiret who excels in what might otherwise be an unsympathetic role. An avowed workaholic, Noiret had initially not taken films too seriously but went from strength to strength, picking up a BAFTA and two Cesars during his career. Anne, the sister-in-law on whom Therese has a &apos;crush&apos; is played by the equally ethereal Edith Scob. The young man with whom Anne falls in love is portrayed by Sami Frey who brings his customary air of mystery to the role. Although the period has been updated, this faithful adaptation by the author himself comes within a productive seven year period for director Georges Franju, during which he made his most satisfying films. He has a highly distinctive visual sense and a subdued directorial style that suits this material perfectly. The power of this film lies in its restraint and its psychological penetration. The subject matter is harsh, austere and uncompromising but the performances, cinematography of Christian Matras and score by Maurice Jarre combine to make it eminently watchable. This is a fine film and arguably Franju&apos;s finest. I certainly would not deter anyone from seeing Claude Miller&apos;s remake with the excellent Audrey Tatou in the title role but Franju&apos;s unique style and its overall atmosphere give the original a definite &apos;edge&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "I gave &quot;Remember?&quot; a 6 because of the cast ONLY. I knew there had to be a disaster made during the &quot;magic&quot; year of 1939, and sure enough, this is it. Robert Taylor, Greer Garson, and Lew Ayres star in what surely is the foreshadowing of &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; except that this is one case where a later film is better than one from the classic era.\n\nThe film concerns a man, Jeff Holland (Taylor) who falls in love with his friend Sky&apos;s (Lew Ayres) fiancé Linda (Garson) and abruptly marries her. However, he&apos;s a workaholic. This makes her very unhappy, and the two divorce. Desirous of getting them back together, Sky uses an experimental drug, that sounded like mematine. It erases everything that happened in the last six months. Interesting, because today there is a drug called memantine for Alzheimer&apos;s, so it actually has an opposite effect.\n\n&quot;Remember?&quot; is only mildly funny. It lacks the pace of a comedy - it&apos;s one of those in between things where the story isn&apos;t compelling enough to be a drama but doesn&apos;t come off like a comedy either. The main part of the plot comes practically at the end of the film. One scene I did love - Billie Burke, as Garson&apos;s mother, has a surprise congratulatory party for the new couple. When they arrive, she has everybody hide behind furniture - which has become somewhat tedious, because the Hollands are late and the entire group has been hiding on and off for hours. When they arrive, Jeff and Linda are sent into the library, where Jeff complains to Linda about her father and her family&apos;s boring, blowhard friends. Then Billie Burke yells surprise. A very good scene, but there weren&apos;t enough of these in the movie to justify it.\n\nThe performances are good. Taylor is unbelievably handsome and really did have a nice flair for comedy. Lew Ayres, in real life a pacifist, vegetarian, and a very spiritual man, somehow played drinking men very well, and does so in this. Garson was still very early in her career but had already received an Oscar nomination. Guess Mayer thought she was a flash in the pan - this is hardly a step in a prestige career. Garson probably hoped she never was nominated for an Oscar again - who knows what MGM would do to her next. Fortunately it didn&apos;t work out that way.\n\n&quot;Remember?&quot; is one of those films you&apos;ll more than likely want to forget.",

A dear friend of mine recommended this movie and I would like to thank her advice. In the end, there is a wonderful message of hope and love - people should live and not be afraid of dying. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Elsa &amp; Fred - Um Amor de Paixão&quot; (&quot;Elsa &amp; Fred - A Love of Passion&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all.  She is quite the egotist.  Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz&apos;s masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.\n\nThe performances are great, regardless, especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders, one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  The film is narrated initially by Sanders, who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic, then by Celeste Holm, the wife of Eve and Margo&apos;s playwrighter, then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90% dialogue, much like a play.  The words are so crisp and sharp, you never sway or lose interest.  These characters are just too interesting.  Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. &quot;Fasten your seatbelts.  Its going to be a bumpy night!&quot;  This is the one everyone remembers, but I would be remiss to get into any others.\n\nThe picture runs well over 2 hours, but it doesn&apos;t seem like enough. Mankiewicz could&apos;ve held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this.  George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award, and rumor has it Davis and Baxter, who was just 27 at the time, were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar.  Time has been very good to the film as well.  1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE&apos;s artistic equal that year was the equally well-written SUNSET BOULEVARD, which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood.  EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought.  There are many references to the film industry, usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing&apos;s boyfriend, who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.\n\nThe movie is highly unpredictable, especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up.  There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up.  This is screenwriting at its finest.",

      "name": "A perfect, moving and soulful adaptation of the beautiful novel upon which it&apos;s based",
      "reviewBody": "A couple of days ago I watched NON TI MUOVERE on its opening night.\n\nWell, I think that it&apos;s a true masterpiece ... gripping, heartfelt, as kudos-deserving as the best-selling novel of the same title upon which it&apos;s based, written by Margaret Mazzantini (here she is the co-screenwriter and also appears in a glimpse-like wordless cameo, at the end of the movie), winner of the Strega - one of Italy&apos;s main literary prizes - in the year 2002.\n\nThe director and male lead Sergio Castellitto - who plays the cowardly ambiguous surgeon Timoteo - is as immense as always. He&apos;s also the other co-screenwriter of the movie. He&apos;s - above all - author Margaret Mazzantini&apos;s husband of many years. His was clearly a true labor of love.\n\nPenélope Cruz is astounding, realistic and yet heartbreaking, enormously moving, totally disappearing into her character, who&apos;s a poor, destitute, cheaply dressed and unkempt woman named Italia. She cleans hotel rooms for a living and lives herself in a slum, but has got the purest and noblest of souls (&quot;She&apos;s a toad in a miniskirt who teaches the Prince how to love&quot;, in actor-director Castellitto&apos;s own words).\n\nComedy actress Claudia Gerini - in her first highly dramatic role as the guy&apos;s betrayed wife - is very, very good herself.\n\nLast but not least, the Castellitto-Cruz chemistry is amazingly powerful: much more so, say, than the Cruise-Cruz one in Vanilla Sky, enough said ...!\n\nI cried my eyes out, even though I had read the novel more than once, therefore perfectly knowing the story!\n\nHERE is a movie which I definitely want to watch multiple times.\n\nAs for myself, well, after two days I&apos;m still re-living all the marvelous, emotionally intense moments which I enjoyed while watching this movie.\n\nReally nothing in Penélope Cruz&apos;s resume will prepare you to what she does here, not even what I think was her best performance before this movie, i.e. Sister Rosa in Pedro Almodovar&apos;s ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER ... nothing indeed! Not to mention that she acts here in Italian language, and she commands it perfectly.\n\nJust to get an idea of her greatness in this movie, here are actor-director Sergio Castellitto&apos;s words at the press conference for the movie, which took place in Rome on March 9th:\n\n&quot;Penélope is heartbreaking, she&apos;s as great as [Federico Fellini&apos;s wife] Giulietta Masina [in the movie La Strada], what she did for this movie is amazing: a lesson of humbleness, passion and courage. But beware! Her act of courage is NOT the fact that she became ugly, this is a silly thing which you use to read everywhere, but it&apos;s wrong; to become ugly for a movie, for an actress like her, who then comes back to her natural beauty, is actually a privilege. Her act of courage, instead, was how she succeeded in building her character&apos;s misery: she got on this horse and she did ride on it, without any radar equipment, with a total faith, asking just for one thing: &apos;I want to act with my own voice, at any cost&apos;. And since I&apos;m an actor myself, I just take a bow in front of a person who tells me: &apos;nobody will touch my own voice&apos;. Anyway, did you hear her? Did you hear how good she is? She gave a true diction lesson to so many, many Italian actresses &quot;.\n\nAnd what about Sergio Castellitto himself? This extremely charming and intelligent man has been an acting God for more than twenty years here in Italy; he&apos;s an uncanny mix of subdued and brainy acting, total sincerity, powerful emotions in display, instant ability to deeply inhabit any character ... and despite his 50 years of age (he&apos;s 20 years older than Penélope), they are absolutely MORE than believable as a mismatched couple of lovers who&apos;re overwhelmed and bewildered by a passion which they can&apos;t explain, not even to themselves. Like I said above, they share a burning-hot chemistry, which is not only a sexual one but a sentimental one as well.\n\nMoreover, I honestly think that I had never seen in ages such a faithful literary screen adaptation: the novel blends into the movie and vice versa. The one takes new life and new breath from the other.\n\nThe opening sequence in the rain, shot from a great height (I&apos;d say that&apos;s the same technique of the opening scene in Vanilla Sky), is stunning ... and from there on, the movie flows easily, always vividly and painfully alive, with no lazy moment, at no slow pace, even though it mainly relies upon a subtle psychological analysis of the characters, with those glances, those conversations, those all-important small gestures, those confrontations, those deep feelings in display ...\n\nI hope that this movie will be adequately distributed in the U.S. also. All those involved in it truly deserve to get a wide recognition for their excellent work.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Sandpiper&quot; is not a great movie but it has a certain appeal and is graced by some beautiful seascapes along the rugged Big Sur coastline. The opening sequence, a montage of steep emerald hills and deep blue sea shot from a helicopter, is particularly well done, featuring a deer dashing up one of the oak-covered slopes, building swells breaking on the rocky shore, and one or two fiery red sunsets. Similar scenes continue to bolster the sense of setting throughout the movie. The storyline, although interesting, can&apos;t quite live up to the dramatic natural location. The love affair between Richard Burton, a jaded Episcopalian priest and headmaster at a boys school in San Simeon, and Elizabeth Taylor, an alienated artist seeking peace and solitude at an isolated beach house, is reasonably convincing. Yet the priest already has a comely wife in the form of Eva Marie Saint and his motivation for stepping outside their marriage isn&apos;t well explained, except that he wants to recapture the idealism of his youth. When a local judge orders that Taylor&apos;s troubled son must attend Burton&apos;s school, he is almost instantly attracted to her and apparently there is nothing to be done about it. \n\nSet in the mid-sixties, when sexual morays were loosening but we were still in the grip of a churchy moralism, this had to be a controversial film, and I vaguely recall that it was. You can visit the locations used in the movie because some are easily recognizable, such as the store/club/restaurant in Big Sur known as &quot;Nepenthe.&quot; And of course, there are the famous stone bridges on Highway One spanning two or three of the rugged chasms. Coursing through the movie, especially during the several seascapes, is the theme &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile.&quot; It&apos;s a nice movie, if not a great one, and worth seeing more than once.",

      "reviewBody": "Although they were both horribly dubbed into English and given stupid English language titles, there were really TWO kinds on 1970&apos;s Italian sex comedies: there were the strictly low-brow ones featuring Italian goofballs like Lino Banfi and Alvaro, which are basically Three Stooges movies with full-frontal nudity, but then there were the more classy (relatively speaking) ones that are more serious--at times even morose--and more distinctly Italian flavored. This movie appears to be one of the former, but is actually one of the latter.\n\nThis movie basically is the story of privileged 20th Italian nobleman &quot;Paolo&quot; who has inherited the hot-blooded nature of his grandfather (Lionel Stander) and uncle (Gaston Moschin), and is given to impulsive acts of violence and compulsive, priapic womanizing. However, he has also inherited the sweet, sensitive nature of his late father and remains always morose and dissatisfied with his dissolute lifestyle, unlike his insensitive grandfather and uncle. He falls in love with a beautiful servant girl (Ornella Muti), but she turns out to be the paid mistress of his grandfather. He briefly meets his match in a Roman society woman (Roseanne Podesta), but she has an affair with his friend. He briefly gets involved with a social gadabout/erstwhile communist (Pilar Velasquez). He is attracted to a pharmacist&apos;s daughter (Barbara Bach) and eventually married her innocent but frigid daughter (Neda Americ). But none of this makes him happy and he keeps finding himself in the company of various streetwalkers (played by actresses like Femi Benussi and Orchidea DeSantis).\n\n&quot;Paolo&quot; is played at different ages by three different actors, the most famous of which is Giancarlo Gianinni. Giannini is good, but his character is not particularly likable or sympathetic. Transplanted French actor Moschin and black-listed Hollywood actor Stander are both pretty charismatic (albeit also insufferable bastards), but they are absent from large parts of the movie. The women are all quite good, but a young (barely 18 at the time) Ornella Muti makes the biggest impression, mostly because she gets nice and naked (and the only thing more beautiful than Ornella Muti clothed is Ornella Muti naked). There&apos;s actually a lot of female nudity, but with the exception of Muti, none of it involves the &quot;name&quot; actresses (even though Velasquez, Americ, Benussi and De Santis were not exactly ever known for keeping their clothes on).\n\nI did see this in Italian with English subtitles, and it does make it a little classier. But despite having a lot going for it, it isn&apos;t quite a good movie."

It discusses how we are all no more then 6 degrees of separation from eachother. Yet this aspect is only the plot. In reality it adds another perspective on our daily lives. Through Ouisa Kittridge it teaches us how mundane our everyday events are, that we all need something drastic to happen to bring us out of sleepy everyday into a fun, exciting, new being. We are equated to John Kittridge who lives his self involved life not noticing the people around him - not the hippy couple in the park who happen to be artists, nor his kids away in college, not even his wife&apos;s true personality. Through Ouisa we are shown how we all look for something new to enter our lives, even a sham like Paul can turn us around, give a new meaning to the mundane. Of course the tango musical theme combined with extensive monologues by Paul forces viewer to dance with and listen into the characters, almost becoming one. (9+/10)"

Carter also has a nice performance the overall plot is dull and static. I believe that because they had to &quot;improvise&quot; and write a new story continuing the original one, the quality of the screenplay and plot decreased significantly. Although there are some funny moments and well written lines for the main characters, many of the others pass by unnoticed. Overall it was a nice, entertaining flick with average 3D effects, way below Avatar, and a simple,uncomplicated plot. Also it was rather short since I expected 120 minutes at least and not 100. Finally I would this movie performed below my expectations. A 7/10 would be a fair grade in my honest opinion. \n\nBest, Stefan",

This film will make you laugh and cry, with some of the funniest lines coming during moments of great pathos. The Maltese setting is luxurious to watch, but does not detract from the personal dramas being played out before us. This film is not your average Romantic Comedy although it fits the bill very well. It is a classy drama which will speak volumes to people who find their children grown and are maybe looking at their lives and wondering how they got where they are and ask &quot;Is this it&quot;? The fact that it is also very funny is the icing on the cake and will make the film appeal to a wide audience. If you watch this, you won&apos;t forget it.",

Buck Rogers (Linden or Larry `Buster&apos; Crabbe) and Buddy (Jackie Moran) had an air crash in 1940, hopefully they survived and were discovered under heavy snow and ice layers 80 years later. Both were conducted to a hidden city, a headquarters of revolutionaries fighting against the injustice of Killer Kane (Anthony Wade), who ruled a very modern city.  The adventures had plenty of fiction, with a lot of action, air-spaceship fighting, modern parachutes, visits to far Saturn planet and others. The only disappointment of the serial was that there was no a single kiss between Buck and his eternal female colleague Wilma (Constance Moore). The soundtrack (of Hajos &amp;Waxman), although it was used in other serials of Flash Gordon and Tim Tyler&apos;s luck, its introductory part is really nice and difficult to find out in any shop at present. It is pity not to see DVD and/or VHS video available with subtitles in Spanish.",

Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn&apos;t as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. \n\nPlus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Brian Aherne, as the Emperor Maximillian, is the strongest thing going for this historical film depicting the failed attempt by Louis Napoleon to create a puppet government in Mexico. The rest of the casting is uneven at best. John Garfield is badly miscast as Diaz, as is that great character actor Donald Crisp. Paul Muni playing the Zapotac Indian, Benito Juarez, manages to just look stoic and sullen and is not called upon to do much acting. Maybe it&apos;s the makeup! Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard are outstanding as Napoleon III and his queen Eugenie and they play at the devious political game with just the right amount of intrigue.\n\nThe film is historically correct and that is part of the problem. The filmmakers put every incident that led to the fall of Maximillian into the story and the film drags on and on. It&apos;s more information that we need to know. \n\nThere are mixed opinions on the Bette Davis portrayal of Empress Carlotta, the unstable wife of Maximillian. Hers is an interesting story but Davis may not have put enough incipient madness into her characterization.\n\nOn the whole,this is a pretty good history lesson with no Hollywood happy ending tacked on, that tells of a well meaning, gentle man who was badly used by the French emperor, sent to rule a people of whom he knew nothing, in a land where he was not wanted. And Aherne absolutely is perfect for the part.....he is the star of this film."

      "reviewBody": "Here in the Bible belt of the United States, particularly in our Southern Baptist churches, when you say the name &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; most of us envision such a person as Brian Deacon, who stars as the title character of &quot;Jesus&quot; (1979). The plot of &quot;Jesus&quot; is generally well-known even by non-believers. The opening scene displays John 3:16-17 from the King James Version. Though the film claims to be entirely from The Gospel of St. Luke, it also mixes elements from Matthew&apos;s Gospel (i.e.: a more complete Lord&apos;s Prayer said by Christ and the use of the trinitarian baptismal formula). \n\nSadly, the acting in &quot;Jesus&quot; is almost as wooden as the oil-painted icons of the Eastern Church. Brian Deacon delivers a sort of solemn, meek interpretation of Jesus of Nazareth--making the scene in which he casts out the money-changers from the temple--look as if he is only frustrated, and not righteously angry. However, in the film&apos;s defense, the acting in &quot;Jesus&quot; is much more a product of its time in that this was generally accepted as to how Jesus acted. \n\n&quot;Jesus&quot; is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, not because of its production values or acting, but because of its content. This 80-minute film, translated into God knows how many languages, has communicated the Gospel to millions all across the globe. &quot;Jesus,&quot; the forerunner of such films as &quot;The Gospel of John&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), is one of the finest examples of evangelical film-making. Recommended for everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "Lina Braake, an 81-year-old lady, has to leave her flat when the flat is inherited by a bank. She has to go to a home for old people. There she meets a former business man, an old fox who officially has been declared incapacitated. Nevertheless, he is involved into several financial transactions, some of them not exactly legal, because he cannot be indicted. He teaches Mrs Braake several tricks of the trade, and develops a scheme to frame the bank who has driven her out of her flat.\n\nThe Italian hairdresser of Mrs Braake also plays an important part, because he wants to go back to Italy, but cannot afford to buy a house there.\n\nThe solution is easy, illegal and good for all participants except the bank. Lina Braake knows exactly about section 20 of the German Code of Penal Law, because she was a keen student of the old business man.\n\n&quot;Lina Braake&quot; is a good movie, therefore rarely transmitted on TV, and probably only in Germany. I had a good laugh and still wonder if a real bank would fall for the trick.",

It involves characters from Hartley&apos;s Henry Fool and attempts a tale of international espionage.\n\nThe film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice).\n\nFay Grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isn&apos;t cookie-cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies description.",

      "name": "Plot and characters are irrelevant: Wong evokes emotions, atmosphere",
      "reviewBody": "With My Blueberry Nights, Wong has effectively made an English-language Asian film. Keeping in step with his previous efforts, My Blueberry Nights is a movie that cares not about its plot or its characters. The characters are simple, stock figures; the plot similarly routine. Stories about heartbreak, abandoning wives, dying fathers, and other such tales have been well represented by the film and television medium over the years, rendering them irrelevant long ago. Even the main premise of a lonely soul going on a cross-country road trip to re-discover herself has been done many times before. But Wong isn&apos;t interested in such things: the plot and his characters are secondary to him. Wong purpose, as with his previous efforts, in particular In The Mood for Love and 2046, is to create a film that visually represents human emotions: feelings such as loneliness, heartbreak, longing, melancholy love. As with Wong&apos;s previous films, My Blueberry Nights does not aim to recreate reality or exist in any sort of realistic, naturalistic setting whatsoever. Wong&apos;s films take place in a fantasy world; an alternate reality in which characters talk in riddles and rhymes, moping for lost love and missed opportunities. Such is the world of In The Mood for Love, 2046, and now My Blueberry Nights as well.\n\nWong employs various elements in order to portray these feelings. First and foremost, his dreamy, floating-camera filming style, helmed by visionary cinematographer Darius Khondji, with Wong temporarily abandoning his equally talented regular cinematographer, Christopher Doyle. Kondji does an excellent job at emulating Doyle and Wong&apos;s unique mutual visual style, filling the frame with vivid colours  reds, oranges, greens, blues; using coloured in-frame natural lighting emulating from neons, fluorescents and other strong light sources; filming through objects such as panes of glass; and quite exquisite framing and composition. The floating, shallow-focus cinematography, colourful but muted, superbly evokes the melancholy longing that the characters feel. Other techniques Wong has used in previous films and uses again this time around are repeated use of mood-evoking songs on the soundtrack, for example.\n\nFor his English-language debut, Wong, who already has quite an air of prestige around him, managed to assemble a very strong cast. The weakest link and indeed what I felt was the film&apos;s biggest flaw is the casting of Norah Jones as the main character. I love her music but in her acting debut she is all right at best. Her wide-eyed innocence is felt but the performance as a whole is not nearly strong enough, especially as the lead performance, which is supposed to carry the film. A more experienced actress could have done wonders with the role, and indeed Wong&apos;s talented and experienced supporting cast members totally steal the show from Jones in their scenes with her together. First in line is Jude Law, whom I believe is unfairly criticized and who is actually quite a talented actor, plays his enigmatic character with charm and energy even though he, like everyone else, is suffering from loneliness, a broken heart and longing for the opportunities and dreams he missed out on. Next up are David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz, both of whom play a bitter couple caught in an endless loop of drama and sport strong Southern drawls. Both actors are in total command of their scenes; Strathairn playing melancholy and self-destructive while Weisz plays fiery and viciously angry. Finally we have Natalie Portman, who seems to be getting better and better at this as she goes along. Like the others she is in total control of her character, commanding all of her scenes and stealing the show from Jones. If Jones&apos; performance is slightly lacking in personality, these four veteran cast members more than deliver the goods and make up for it with powerful, lively performances that provide the film with another level of interest beyond the sublime cinematography and direction.",

It won the Critics Award (and Best Cinematography), but it deserved many more, that was the general feeling in Málaga.

Escapees from a Civil War prison camp are blown way off course in a balloon they stole. They find themselves on an apparently deserted island somewhere in the Pacific, are joined by two women who were shipwrecked, and eventually come face-to-face with Captain Nemo and the wrecked Nautilus.\n\nThey have to deal with pirates, an erupting volcano and Harryhausen&apos;s creature threats. These include very large versions of a hungry red crab, an aggressive chicken (or dodo), a bee and an unhappy squid. Some of the creatures turn out to be very good boiled or roasted.\n\nThe movie holds up well because of a strong story, good action, and fairly well-defined characters. It features Herbert Lom, in my view an under-rated actor, and Joan Greenwood. By this time Greenwood was taking character parts and doing a lot of stage work. But from the mid-Forties to the mid-Fifties she was, I think, one of the sexiest, smartest actors Britain has ever produced. Her plummy, smoky voice is inimitable."

If you like Kay Francis, that&apos;ll be even better since she&apos;s the lead of this one. She plays a nightclub singer who shoots and kills a man one night during a performance. She sees Basil Rathbone in the audience sitting with his arm around Jane Bryan, and for reasons she won&apos;t explain, she kills him. Even when she&apos;s on trial for her life, she still won&apos;t reveal her motivation.\n\nThere are lots of flashbacks in this one, and the intriguing story will keep you guessing. I&apos;m not really a Kay Francis fan, but I like to see Basil Rathbone in a romantic role. It&apos;s easy to see how Jane Bryan got the role of the innocent daughter in The Old Maid after her part in this drama. If you like this movie, try Madame X or The Trial of Mary Dugan for more black-and-white courtroom classics.",

It is for the most part a typical and overdone Hindi masala flick which has action, romance, tons of tears and many songs. However, it still can provide a nice watch for the entire family for lovers of Hindi films. Every genre has its fans, I&apos;m not a big fan of this genre but I can enjoy it when I&apos;m with family and friends and there is nothing to be taken seriously. Some parts of this movie were actually quite entertaining to me (some were unintentionally so). The entire Salman-Rambha track when she pretends to be blind in order to trap him was pretty funny. I liked the brother-sister relationship portrayed in the film. However unrealistic this movie is, this part was, to an extent, well done. Everything else in the film was old-fashioned platitude, particularly Ashwini Bhave&apos;s character&apos;s corny belief that a woman must never leave her husband&apos;s house unless she dies, even if he brings another woman home. Jackie Shroff plays the husband who gets trapped by a young prostitute with restraint. Ashwini Bhave does very well as his wife Shweta Menon as the seductress is typical but effective. Rambha is passable in her role and she looks quite pretty. This film, however, is Salman Khan&apos;s film, and is made strictly for his fans, who certainly will not be disappointed by his work here. He is the reason this film remains watchable even at its most pathetic and intolerable points. There&apos;s nothing to rave about Bandhan, but I&apos;m not going to be too harsh on it. It&apos;s time-pass, better watched with family and friends, nothing more and nothing less.",

      "reviewBody": "A solidly produced, very entertaining, low budget comedy-drama with a fine leading cast providing excellent, more-than-satisfying performances.\n\n During World War I, a poor Italian private (Orsini) and a peasant girl (Lisi) capture an aristocratic Austrian General (Steiger). The Italians trek back to their own lines, hoping to gain a fortune of 1,000 Lira for the capture of the general. \n\nThe movie focuses on the three leads for virtually the entire film. The only supporting characters involved are a few Austrian soldiers and one Italian who appears at the beginning, only to be captured and instantly forgotten. Otherwise, the film is all about the central characters. Each actor makes their character come alive. Orsini is excellent as the somewhat dimwitted, illiterate Italian private who, like thousands of others, was drafted. It&apos;s just his pure luck that he captured the General. Lisi, like Orsini, is illiterate. She, however, is a civilian. Her everyday life has been disrupted by the war. She has to beg, scour and scrounge for food, water and clothing. She knows that the money can benefit her, also, and is constantly double-crossing Orsini - although the two inevitably fall in love.\n\n Steiger, on the other hand, is great in an offbeat role as the General. He&apos;s not a loud, maniacal general a la WATERLOO. Instead, he is sympathetic to his captors for one moment; but, taking advantage of their slight stupidity, he is constantly escaping - only to be captured again. He has a few sentimental moments - teaching the girl to write her name; explaining that he only fights in war because his father did before him; comforting the girl during her last moments. By the end of the film, Steiger has transformed into a caring, likeable father figure; Orsini has gone from a selfish young man to a more sacrificing husband; and Lisi is a more concerned wife. \n\n The movie, while being basically a character study - drama, has quite a few memorable comic moments. Men locked inside a water barrel rolling into a river; long, witty dialog scenes between the smart fool Orsini and the pompous General Steiger; etc. It&apos;s all funny in a subtle way; nothing will have you outright laughing, and most of the gags don&apos;t really kick in until AFTER they&apos;re over with. \n\nThe Italian scenery is absolutely stunning. Every shot is filled with breathtaking background images of blue skies, green mountains, rocky valleys and rushing rivers. Ennio Morricone provides (as usual) a perfect music score. At times, it&apos;s ultra-weird, with a mix of Italian lyrics and odd instrumentation; some pieces have a strong resemblance to his later, war-time theme in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY - most recognizably during the scene with the drunken Union Captain. \n\nTurner Classic Movies plays a nearly perfect print of this movie. The colors are fresh, accurate and intense. There is hardly a print flaw. It is presented in an aspect ration of about 1.77:1. I wish TCM would release more Italian war films - or, just more Italian films - with the same great digital restoration. \n\nTHE GIRL AND THE GENERAL is an overlooked, funny and dramatic anti-war picture. It is not instantly a classic, by any means, but still holds its place in the genre and is worth seeking out.\n\nRATING: 7/10"

      "reviewBody": "Okay let me be honest. Under no circumstances would I have picked this movie up. I didn&apos;t like the art on the DVD cover and the plot didn&apos;t thrill me. The price however was under a buck so I figured I could risk trying something different just because it was cheap. Boy was I surprised, actually to be perfectly honest I enjoyed this movie more than I did most of the movies I&apos;ve seen recently that I actually wanted to see.\n\nThe plot of the film has a poor boy falling in love with a rich girl from a private school. Things happen and they soon have to deal with the fact that there&apos;s a baby on the way.\n\nThe story is nothing new, however it doesn&apos;t follow the typical movie of the week formula. Sure there are complications, including a run in with the law because the girl is underage, but it doesn&apos;t always take the easy way out, indeed there is the possibility that after the credits roll that things may not be happy down the road. Still the film is very watchable.\n\nThe film works for two reasons.\n\nFirst the writing of the characters is sharp. These are likable and real people. The early scene where the boy and his friends crash the school dance in order to find out the girls name is utterly charming.You connect with him and his lady love and are pretty well good to go from that point on. And as the film progresses you find you care about all of the characters you meet and you become interested in what happens to them.\n\nThe other reason this film works is the cast. Across the board they are note perfect. Then again most of the actors are people who have been working in the Hong Kong industry for years and are good in everything.\n\nIs this the greatest film ever to come down the pike? No, of course not, but its a really nice, well acted little movie that odds are you&apos;d pass over at the video store. This is one of those movies that makes it worth going off the usual cinematic menu and trying something different.",

Certainly any &apos;Tamilan&apos; who watches this film, can feel the pride of knowing about an ancestor like Bodhidharman. A.R.Murugadoss have caught such a solid premise and the initial 20 minutes of the film really sets the tone really big.\n\nHowever, what makes it fall apart is the weak and unfocused screenplay which often slips out of the main objective of the story. Badly placed songs and redundant love track (which comes immediately after the epic 20 minutes start), are some of the examples of the wandering screenplay. The vision of the director and what he wanted to tell the world is very clear by just seeing the visuals and the central plot itself, therefore some of the preachy dialogues could be avoided. In addition, Harris Jeyaraj - Murgadoss combination is surprisingly missing in this film.\n\nOn the brighter side, 7aam Arivu boasts with good use of technicality. Be it Ravi Varman&apos;s subtle yet epic cinematography or Rajeevan&apos;s grand art direction, they impress to the core, enhancing the story. All the actors score well in their given role but the real scene stealer is Johnny Tri Nguyen who casually cake-walks his role with such a majestically menacing posture. However the over use of &apos;Nokku Varmam&apos; by the character rips the whole genuine feel of the art.\n\nAs expected by many, 7aam Arivu might not be a next Ghajini but really scores in the originality and the patriotic feel towards the Tamil. In overall 7aam Arivu is not a disappointing fare but not a remarkable one either.",

      "reviewBody": "Tough guys. Always going on suicidal missions. Threatened by bullets and blades. Running from explosions. Best friends waging wars. Nearly killing each other, then going to the bar later to laugh about it. Director and star, Sylvester Stallone, gets all his best men together to kick as much ass as humanly possible, allowing himself a severe beating from Steve Austin. Sly took a serious neck injury. Then he goes in front of a Comic Con audience and jokes about it. A man whose Double-&quot;R&quot; franchises, Rocky and Rambo have both been highly successful. But he keeps coming back for more pain and putting his body on the line for the sake of entertainment. There&apos;s nothing tougher than that!\n\nThe Expendables is a movie that lifts you up out of your seat, pats you on the head, gives you a lollipop then smashes you in the frickin&apos; face! With a cast like Jason Stathum, Randy Couture, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Terry Crews, Dolph &quot;I Must Break You&quot; Lundgren, and cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, you&apos;d think it would be one crazy mess. Surprisingly, it&apos;s more focused then you may think. Just a straight-forward action movie with a reasonable run time that sustains itself and never has a chance to feel dull. It doesn&apos;t try to be anything more than what it is.\n\nThe only negative: Some of the blood and explosions looked digital. Wish it could have been just a bit more authentic. Sometimes, there was a tad too many closeups during the fight scenes. With so many people fighting at the same time, sometimes I couldn&apos;t tell who was punching who. It didn&apos;t happen very often, but how cool would it be just for one moment to see three simultaneous fights from a super wide master shot? Never, but I can&apos;t blame them. At least let the cameras pull back and allow the choreography to do the work.\n\nIt feels nice to get my ass kicked by something I haven&apos;t seen yet. It&apos;s not Rambo. It&apos;s not Rocky. Nor is it another Die Hard or Terminator sequel. It&apos;s something fresh, yet feels like it came out of the 80&apos;s. It has the perfect blend of humor, blood, sweat, smart-ass comebacks, witty one-liners, and an overabundance of testosterone! Don&apos;t expect anything more than action, exposition, action, exposition, all with a nice cherry on top with sprinkles and grenades. And some real tough guys. We all wish we could be tough guys. But no, let&apos;s just watch&apos;em instead."

The subject of this movie has never been dealt with in a non-X movie and it should have been done with tact instead of a loose comedy hand. The cast is good except the above duo. Dana Delany is great as the Mistress of a pleasure island; she takes a chance and shows her sexy side of herself as well as full body nudity. You watch this movie and shake your head about how good it could have been. read the book, forget the movie. 4 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "This film is great fun, and often -- and I think intentionally, as in the &apos;Satan Synne&apos; segment -- very funny: &quot;an extravagant story that never by any chance could be taken seriously,&quot; as one contemporary reviewer approves. It&apos;s hard to sympathise with spoiled wife Vivian at first (a hard-edged performance by Gloria Swanson), but as the film goes on we start to realise that she does have a point.\n\nThis being a de Mille film, the costumes are of course fantastic; although it&apos;s actually not Swanson, the famous &apos;clothes-horse&apos;, who gets the best dresses here. Production values are elsewhere very high, as well, extending into beautifully-drawn title cards (in one case, with a live-action car actually driving across it!) and a lot of sacrificed furniture, while frankly, those jewelled flowers look almost worth losing a lover over...\n\nBut it&apos;s not all gloss and enjoyable silliness. There&apos;s some fine acting on display as well, not least from Wallace Reid as the well-meaning &apos;Tony&apos; whose halo begins progressively to slip -- and, in a couple of telling little scenes, from Elliott Dexter as the overlooked best friend. (The little scene over the chessboard is a perfect illustration of the power of the silent screen: everything made explicit without a word.) \n\nThe picture&apos;s stage heritage shows up mainly in a few over-long title cards, where plot points are conveyed in one long &apos;speech&apos;; at almost two hours in duration, it&apos;s also unbalanced in the direction of the first half, which could almost stand as a film on its own without its briefer &apos;sequels&apos;. If Emilie is not to have a film of her own, there is perhaps a little too much time devoted to her.\n\nBut &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; is well worth seeing -- not least, as an eye-opener for those like myself who associate C.B. de Mille with vast Biblical epics. This piece of froth and frivolity has more of the charm of a Harold Lloyd movie minus the slapstick; one can really see why &apos;handsome Wallace Reid&apos; was a star; and there are just enough well-judged moments of genuine feeling among the spectacle and satire to make us care about the various minor players.",

Well, as good as the cast is, nothing can compensate for the dull and dreary script and direction.\n\nThe film wants to be serious and on a certain level it does achieve a realistic portrayal of a boxer&apos;s life but making a movie that&apos;s dreary and dull does not automatically equal greatness. Some directors, writers or producers seem to confuse greatness with dullness, which I&apos;ll never understand. And this slight film definitely suffers from this artistic affliction.\n\nIf you want to see where Steve Buscemi started or one of Brad Davis&apos; last films, in which he, again, often appears in his underwear (see MIDNIGHT EXPRESS or QUERELLE), well you should check this out. But aside from the cast, I don&apos;t see any other reason to watch this.",

      "reviewBody": "My wife and I just finished watching this movie and throughout much of it, she kept asking me &quot;are you SURE you want to finish this film?!&quot;. I have to admit that I thought about turning it off a few times, too, but it never was quite bad enough to merit this--though it sure came close!! In light of the general view that the film was a major debacle when it debuted, I was actually surprised to see one reviewer gave it a 9.\n\nAs for the plot and how it differs from the novel by Emile Zola, I&apos;ll leave you to read over tracyfigueira&apos;s excellent review. I haven&apos;t read the book but knew enough about it to realize that the plot was dramatically different from Zola&apos;s. One of the reasons is that although they never say it, it&apos;s very obvious that Nana was a prostitute and had slept with half of Paris! And her friends were also common prostitutes as well. Yet, Sam Goldwyn insisted that Nana be played like a combination of Marlene Dietrich and the Singing Nun! Oy.\n\nWhen the tale of this trollop with a heart of gold debuted in 1934, critics howled at the horrible acting of newcomer Anna Sten and the public avoided this bloated epic like the plague. In fact, for years, consensus was that Sten was a horrible actress and her performance convinced me that the people of the 30s were very astute--she was a terrible actress. Her accent was difficult to cut through and her &quot;acting&quot; was amateurish throughout. However, I also feel that to blame the picture&apos;s demise squarely on her was unfair. Even if Ms. Sten had been competent (and I remind you she was NOT), the writing was just awful and anyone uttering such claptrap would look ridiculous! Plus, Goldwyn&apos;s insistence that Sten be treated like an even more bewitching creature than Dietrich and Garbo was silly and destined to failure--and making Sten look even more ridiculous as she tried in vain to act that alluring. Heck, when Sten sang (if you can call it that), before she even finished this god-awful number, the men in the audience (who had previously never even heard of her) all began behaving like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf! No one is THAT sexy and desirable!! In addition to all this silliness and bad acting, the film also suffers from bad acting by many of the co-stars--particularly Nana&apos;s hooker friends. And, to make things worse, the film is also dreadfully dull and derivative--looking like a knockoff of several of Garbo&apos;s and Dietrich&apos;s films (especially CAMILLE and BLONDE VENUS). See this film if you are curious about Sten--otherwise, avoid it like the plague.\n\nBy the way, and I know this will sound VERY catty, but in watching this film I kept asking myself if perhaps Ms. Sten and Mr. Goldwyn have some other vested interest in each other. I know this sounds petty, but his insistence on a huge publicity campaign to create an American career and three failed big budget US films does make you wonder why he brought her to this country to begin with or kept her here after her performance in NANA.",

      "reviewBody": "It has been twelve years since Jim Douglas last won a race; in fact, it has been twelve years since he last drove a race but he has selected the prodigious France-Monte Carlo race to make their come back. Being greeted with laughter is a problem they can overcome but when Herbie falls in love with a rival car it means that he is distracted and more interesting in impressing her than giving his all. Mind you, even if they manage to get over that problem Jim and Wheely don&apos;t even know about the stolen diamond in their fuel tank or the international thieves chasing them to get it back.\n\nHerbie films have never been about high production standards, character or plot and this entry in the series is no exception. The plot mixes one thread about a jewel robbery and another about romance. The former is the more enjoyable strand but it doesn&apos;t do enough to get the most out of it because it focuses more on the romance side of things. In regards Herbie, this at least provides some scenes that kids will find funny with the two cars, however it also brings tiresome bits between Douglas and Diane Darcy that aren&apos;t fun at all. It all does what you expect it to in all regards and there isn&apos;t anything special here but most of it is amusing and inoffensive enough for adults to watch while also being broad, visual and silly enough to keep children content.\n\nDean Jones is happy to mug along as usual and he does it well enough to fit the mood of the film; likewise Knotts pulls faces and gurns as much as he possibly can. Sommars is really rather annoying and has as little character as her character&apos;s ugly and charisma-lacking car. Herbie is amusing as ever and the film does well to draw a character out of the car without resorting to the cheap effects used by the modern entry.\n\nOverall this is not a great film but it is an enjoyable kids movie and should be viewed as such. It is delivered with consistent good humour even if it has no surprises or laughs to really speak of. Adults might get bored of it easily but are unlikely to be annoyed by it, while children should be amused and distracted by the inoffensive antics."

The ship Prometheus goes looking for the beginning of mankind and what created us. It&apos;s a rather ambitious idea and the film should be given credit for trying to have some kind of theological and scientific debate. Unfortunately, the script also feels as though it has to give us the scares and frights that we associate with the Alien films. The majority of the film is intriguing but for every positive there is a negative. We get fascinating characters such as David, Vickers, and Janek. But they are mostly pushed aside to focus on the stupid scientist characters. Did the writers not realise how bad their work was? Rapace refuses to let one character take weapons on an expedition because it is a &quot;scientific&quot; mission. I call BS on that. No scientist would be so stupid as to explore a new planet, with no information on said planet, without a bit of protection. Characters decide to do stupid stuff, such as approach viscous looking new species etc. and it is here where the film annoyed me. The set design was beautiful, and I enjoyed the quieter moments the film had to offer, such as David&apos;s trying to understand emotions etc. The most interesting ideas the film has are delivered in single lines of dialogue, but are never explored. It&apos;s head and shoulders above many science fiction films of late, but it also needs a few sequels to clear things up. Unfortunately, that means it wasn&apos;t so great as a stand alone film.",

Although the influence of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese can be felt throughout the whole film, P.T. Anderson doesn&apos;t copy them but merely uses some of their trademark techniques to create his very own, unique brand of film.\n\nThere are so many creative ideas and standout scenes in this film: I&apos;m sure that, similarly to how filmmakers of Anderson&apos;s generation are citing films like &apos;Nashville&apos; or &apos;Goodfellas&apos; as their inspiration, the next generation of aspiring directors will be citing &apos;Magnolia&apos;. The film is not &quot;just&quot; a masterpiece, but also hugely influential and an instant classic. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",

      "reviewBody": "A trio of desperadoes, fleeing from a violent Christmastime bank robbery, become THREE GODFATHERS after rescuing a dead mother&apos;s baby in the desert.\n\nHere is a very fine little film, (largely forgotten due to its color remake years later starring John Wayne) which rewards the fortunate viewer with very good acting, excellent production values, some taut drama and a fair amount of humor.\n\nLewis Stone dominates the film as the thief with a conscience. Quietly intellectual &amp; patrician, his tenderness for the infant is immediate and absolute. Stone&apos;s acting cannot be faulted; watching him painfully choose which of his beloved books to leave behind in the burning desert is to see a true artist at work.\n\nChester Morris does a dandy job of making the viewer both like and despise his character. Quick-tempered &amp; revengeful, his attack upon the New Jerusalem bank is his opportunity to wreck havoc on both the town which rejected him and the decent young banker in love with his former sweetheart. Morris wants nothing to slow down his escape--not poisoned water holes or dead horses, and especially not a helpless baby.\n\nWalter Brennan practically steals the entire movie with his portrayal of an old, illiterate outlaw whose childlike innocence and decency compels him to protect the infant. He also has some droll comedy sequences, especially at the Church Social, where he has a memorable encounter with a plate of asparagus. His scenes in the desert, with desperate thirst stalking his footsteps, show the consummate skill he would exhibit the rest of his life as one of America&apos;s favorite character actors.\n\nIn smaller roles, Sidney Toler is wonderfully droll as an itinerate dentist with a deadly aim; bucktoothed Victor Potel is his unfortunate customer. Rotund Roger Imhof plays the friendly sheriff of New Jerusalem; Dorothy Tree is the saloon hostess with a hankering for Morris. Pretty Irene Hervey does well as Morris&apos; former love; her fiancé is nicely played by Robert Livingston, who finds the padding in his Santa suit to be most fortuitous.",

They have to kill one another leaving 1 person at the end who gets to keep the young body even in real life.\n\nThe idea is great and makes for great SciFi and some good ethical and moral questions. However, aside from Rutger Hauer&apos;s first 5 minutes, you quickly realise that the dialogue is awful, as if put together by some student writers who don&apos;t have a clue. It&apos;s like something from a 1950&apos;s melodrama.\n\nThe acting is pitiful mostly throughout the film. Not just bad, but embarrassingly bad. I felt for the actors, if they watched themselves on screen they may well be embarrassed at themselves for their poor performances.\n\nWas it the Director that had no idea how to direct them? I don&apos;t know but the videographer was poor too. Obviously the camera was hand held throughout, but not even steady cam. So watching it was almost like having vertigo.\n\nI gave it a 3 because I loved the idea of it and the overall storyline, I just think how it was brought to film was poor, amateurish and sloppy.",

This is good, as we have no reason to give a damn about those up for the killing. It removes any need for character development, not usually a plus but we all know why we came to this film. It&apos;s a shame they&apos;ve reduced the mutated hillbilly family to pretty much just one guy. There&apos;s needless gore, repetitive chase sequences and a bizarre car scene which is a mix of very bad greenscreen and location work. It was confusing. The ending really ticked me off though, the ultimate in tacked on, thoughtless, middle finger up to the audience endings. Even for something this cheap and quick, they could have at least respected the characters a tiny bit.",

      "reviewBody": "Sylvia (Amy Brenneman) and her husband, Daniel (Jimmy Smits) have been married for a little over 20 years. But, one day, Daniel drops the big bombshells that he is seeing another woman and that he wants a divorce. Sylvia is heartbroken, so much so that her young, beautiful, lesbian daughter Allegra moves back home to keep an eye on her. Close friend, Jocelyn (Maria Bello) is also hovering over Sylvia and decides to create a book club so that the jilted lady will be surrounded by friends, conversation, and hope. Joining the club is a six-time divorcée (Kathy Baker), an uptight young French teacher, Prudie (Emily Blunt), and Allegra herself. But, because they decide the club will be devoted to Jane Austen and her six books, they need one more member to put someone in charge of each, distinct book discussion. Therefore, Jocelyn invites Grigg (Hugh Dancy), an attractive young man she met at a hotel bar, to join them. In truth, he has eyes for Jocelyn and, although a science fiction fan, would read almost anything to get to know her better. Thus, the discussions start, but the repartee is, at times, only a brief breather from the continuing problems of the club members. These troubles include death, near-infidelity, sky-diving crashes, crazy mothers, and more. Will the club work to the benefit of its members? This is a lovely film about the friends and relationships that make human existence bearable. As the bosom buddies, the movie&apos;s fine cast members are all quite wonderful, with Blunt, especially, still managing to make her flawed, confused character, endearing. The California setting is beautiful, naturally, and so are the costumes. Then, too, the script is lively and refined, echoing Austen&apos;s great books. Indeed, there is enough of Jane&apos;s novels worked into the film&apos;s content to satisfy the fans of her highly esteemed works. In short, book yourself a showing of this film and invited your friends to join you at the viewing. Forgive me, but you will &quot;club yourself&quot; if you don&apos;t!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Moon is Blue&quot; was denied a Production Code seal and the refusal was upheld upon appeal to the board of the Motion Picture Association, primarily because the character played by Maggie McNamara announced that she was a Virgin and intended to remain one until she was married. The words virgin and seduction were used frequently in this film that was mainly a comedy about being occupied or pre-occupied with sex and,for those reasons it was denied approval, and it was released and shown minus approval. It wasn&apos;t the first film to be denied a Production Code seal, but it was the one that led to the ultimate demise of the power of the Hays Office, the Legion of Decency and various local blue-nose censor boards to determine what could not be said or done on screen."

      "reviewBody": "J. Edgar Hoover, it now seems, was a mediocre crimefighter but a master orchestrator of his own publicity (and only secondarily that of the FBI). The Street With No Name stands as one of the better films dedicated to kissing his assiduously cultivated legend.  Most directors assigned these tasks in the noir cycle wrote off such idolatry as a cost of doing business, clearing it away quickly so as to get on with their moviemaking; William Keighley follows this sensible agenda.\n\nFBI agent Mark Stevens goes undercover to infiltrate the mob in that cesspool of crime, Center City, USA.  In the boxing ring, he attracts the attention, slightly open to inference, of boss Richard Widmark, a dapper (&quot;I like my boys to look sharp&quot;) cutthroat with a morbid fear of drafts and sneezes.  With the aid of confederate John McIntyre, Stevens reports the gang&apos;s plans back to the FBI.  Alas, a high-placed informant in the police department reports the FBI&apos;s plans back to Widmark.\n\nSo the movie boils down to the agent-in-peril story.  Keighley tells it cleanly and briskly, eschewing the complexities (both visual and moral) of Anthony Mann&apos;s T-Men, released just a few months earlier.  It&apos;s strongest in the feel for Center City&apos;s raffish tenderloin, with its fleabag hotels, pool halls and walk-up gyms.  Stevens, McIntyre and Lloyd Nolan (as Stevens&apos; superior) give workmanlike jobs with the rather staid roles scriptwriter Harry Kleiner supplies.  His few-frills approach reins in Widmark, too, who&apos;s always better when he&apos;s unfettered and shooting over the top. \n\n The Street With No Name suffers a bit from staying so resolutely all-guy; thus Barbara Lawrence suffers, too, in an underwritten and inconsequential part as Widmark&apos;s abused moll.  A little more cool yin might have balanced out all that hot, hard yang.\n\nNOTE: In 1955, Samuel Fuller remade -- and rethought -- this movie, using the same screenwriter and cinematographer (Joe MacDonald, now working in color) as House of Bamboo, set in postwar Tokyo.",

      "reviewBody": "In terms of its storyline, &quot;Darkness&quot; is pretty much like every other haunted house movie ever made. We start off with the usual unsuspecting family of four who find themselves knee deep in ghouls and ghosts the moment they move into their new residence (the family is American and the home is in Spain in this outing). Of course, anyone in his right mind would hightail it out the door two seconds after setting foot in the house - but not this group! They want to hang around to see what &quot;happens.&quot; It is Oscar-winner Anna Paquin, as the moody but perceptive teenaged daughter of the clan, who gets to have her name above the title here - a dubious distinction at best, I&apos;m sorry to say.\n\n&quot;Darkness&quot; has just about all the standard accoutrement&apos;s one would expect to find in a film on this subject. In addition to the perpetual thunderstorm taking place outside and the electricity that keeps going out on cue, we also have the self-activating toys, the strange voices on the telephone, the ghostly images on photographs, the father who becomes exponentially more psychotic in every scene in which he appears, and the mysterious old man with the limp who shows up out of nowhere and seems to hold the key to everything. Seasoned veterans will be able to predict just about every hackneyed setup and cliché a full hour before it officially arrives on screen. For instance, we just know, without room for quibble, that the minute the mother brings home a box of colored pencils for her delighted little boy to play with, the tyke will start drawing strange and disturbing pictures to help push the plot points along. It&apos;s practically de rigueur when it comes to films in this vein. (However, I must say, in all fairness, that the movie does NOT include the cat-jumping-out-at-the-audience scene, which is pretty much standard issue for every horror flick these days. The filmmakers DO earn some bonus points for that).\n\nPaquin makes for a feisty heroine, and it isn&apos;t really her fault that her character always seems to be ten giant steps behind the audience in figuring it all out. And as to the &quot;What the *&amp;$%?&quot; ending - well, it&apos;s either so brilliant that it is beyond the ken of mere mortal man to figure out, or it&apos;s one of the biggest final curtain stumbles in horror movie history. I have my own personal notion as to which of those two it really is, but I&apos;ll let you figure that one out for yourself. After all, I have to leave you with SOMETHING interesting to do while you&apos;re watching this film.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Splice&quot; is a step in the right direction for horror.\n\nEvery so often, I find myself pleasantly surprised by intentionally misadvertised entertainment, and writer/director Vincenzo Natali&apos;s genetic genre mash-up is the latest such example. From a marketing standpoint, its scare-tactics are clearly the easy sell, despite their comprising only a tiny percentage of its thematic intent. &apos;Hard sci-fi parenting metaphor&apos; is, after all, a much tougher pitch.\n\nSo expecting the tasteless creature feature from the trailer, &quot;Splice&quot; impressed me in its pursuit of a more complex emotional response than fear, and is successful in burrowing into your subconscious and picking at your psyche. It&apos;s a thinking man&apos;s B picture, which plays with the idea of morality on both a scientific and personal level. That it remains intellectually stimulating, even when the surface-area film dips into more traditionally hokey horror territory, is its greatest strength.\n\nWhat&apos;s so interesting about the story, in spite of what the trailer suggests, is that the creature artificially spawned by genetic engineers Clive and Elsa (Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley) is not an antagonist for the vast majority of the film. &quot;Splice&quot; isn&apos;t about a monster— It&apos;s about parenthood, and like with &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; or &quot;Eraserhead,&quot; taking the associated fears and filtering them through a horror lens. \n\nBesides the tail and the pronounced facial cleft, test-tube baby Dren (&apos;Nerd&apos; backwards, heh) is essentially human, and a big part of &quot;Splice&apos;s&quot; inherent creepiness is that she&apos;s treated in turn as a subject and a child—Warmly received, but caged and abandoned for significant stretches of time. The realization of this character by French actress Delphine Chanéac, is another of the film&apos;s triumphs. Her general lack of dialogue sometimes forces the performance to rely a little too heavily on pantomime, but that we can both feel for and fear Dren simultaneously is a testament to the range of the actress.\n\nPerhaps it&apos;s because &quot;Splice&quot; nails the big performances and the big ideas, and because the gears turning behind the action are so consistently fluid, that it&apos;s all the more apparent when it stumbles over little things, like stilted motivation issues, and superfluous, grating secondary characters. Clive&apos;s brother (Brandon McGibbon) and boss (David Hewlett), for example, are flat placeholder roles that transparently progress the plot instead of enriching it. The triangular relationship between Clive, Elsa, and Dren, and its weird morphing emotional permutations, is what &quot;Splice&quot; is at its core. It is a film with very few characters, but every moment not spent on that central dynamic feels like time wasted.\n\nStill, that minor gripe is forgivable because &quot;Splice&quot; has two hugely important and rare qualities for modern horror—Original thought and fearless storytelling. The undercurrent of sexuality in the film, the internal dialogue on gender roles, is apparently one of the reasons no studio wanted to touch the script last year, but Natali&apos;s film is a cut above the rest precisely because it isn&apos;t afraid to make an audience uncomfortable. And it gets uncomfortable.\n\n&quot;Splice&quot; gets a lot of credit from me in the abstract. The concrete film doesn&apos;t quite live up to the incredible promise of the ideas behind it, but the very presence of those ideas is reaffirming to a degree, and that &quot;Splice&quot; received a wide domestic release is more encouraging still. Granted, it went on to perform below expectations at the box office, but was positioned against more breezy summer fare like &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Get Him to the Greek.&quot; \n\nThe other possibility, and this suggests more consumer confidence than an ad man may be inclined to grant, is that &quot;Splice&apos;s&quot; scare-tactics aren&apos;t the easy sell. Maybe, like me, potential moviegoers just saw a trailer for another crappy horror movie instead of the interesting, offbeat experiment it is.\n\nIt&apos;s Warner Brother&apos;s loss, and the audience&apos;s.",

      "reviewBody": "While many people slated DIE HARD 4.0, I enjoyed watching it the few times I&apos;ve seen it since release; I felt like it was a moderately successful way to bring the Bruce Willis-starring franchise slap bang into the 21st century, although of course it wasn&apos;t as good as the original trilogy. Inevitably, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD followed, but the bad news is that it makes the last instalment look like a masterpiece by comparison.\n\nThis movie really is that bad, and it&apos;s all down to the people who made it. Much of the blame can be laid at the door of director John Moore, who makes even more of a mess with this than he did with MAX PAYNE; he can&apos;t even do basics like where to place his actors in their shots, and he manages to screw up every action scene in the movie (and believe me, there are a lot of them).\n\nStill, it&apos;s no surprise that the appalling script was written by one Skip Woods, who also handled the equally rubbishy A-TEAM movie. Woods is without a doubt the worst writer currently working in Hollywood and why people still employ him is anybody&apos;s guess.\n\nWillis realises he&apos;s making a turkey so he makes no effort whatsoever; he sleepwalks through this with a monotonous voice guaranteed to send most moviegoers to sleep. This isn&apos;t John McClane, not even the McClane of DIE HARD 4.0; instead it&apos;s just some tired old guy who clearly doesn&apos;t want to be there. As his son, Jai Courtney is given a one-dimensional character and displays none of the charm he brought to his role as Varro in SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND.\n\nThe film meanders from one pointless action scene to the next, and we never get a clear idea of who the bad guys are or what they want; Willis just kind of stumbles into their plans (whatever they are) and goes along with it. The violence is mind-numblingly routine, and despite the explosive special effects the film offers little in the way of entertainment, with an early car chase being the only half-decent part purely for its destructive visuals. The great Sebastian Koch is wasted en route, and the film ends with a CGI-fuelled whimper.\n\nI hope to God I never have to see it again.",

We really don&apos;t learn anything new here but it&apos;s always interesting hearing directors speak of their favorite films and there are some nice stories told here. Psycho gets the majority of the talk but I always find these stories the most entertaining since this film does contain the greatest number of shocks. A lot of detail is also given to Hitchcock&apos;s relationship with his wife, which was pretty touching. AKA Hitchcock: Shadow of a Genius."

      "reviewBody": "As the movie was drawing to a close, the question of whether one could really jump over an oncoming car was nagging me. Some brief research highlighted an increase of the average car height throughout recent decades to about 1.5 meters, but one could certainly go for an aggressive sports car, which only measures about 1.2 meters. The world record for high jump stands at 2.5 meters, but that&apos;s a running jump, so can you do it standing still, as the movie suggests? \n\nPutting my metaphorical glasses back on, I&apos;ll admit my interest was piqued when the realization came about that this movie is inspired by Werner Herzog&apos;s hike from Munich to Paris, in 1974, in support of his mentor, Lotte Eisner. Here, our lead Julian is a young man institutionalized for harboring said belief of car jumping, which ends up causing a tragic accident, wherein his best friend is killed. The story kicks off with Julian&apos;s escape from the facility he was being held in, as he aims to walk over 600 km to the house where his friend&apos;s father lives, recovering after a heart attack. The point of walking is to focus all his energy towards the father&apos;s betterment, in the spirit of a &apos;holy&apos; pilgrimage. Along the way, Julian meets up with Ju and Ruth, both in need of a long walk to cleanse their unhappiness. All the while, Jan is on their heels, trying to find and return Julian to the asylum.\n\nThis constitutes the main theme of the movie, a paradoxical one at that: taking on a selfish/selfless journey, an escape from how the world sees you, how you see the world and how you see yourself. The great thing is that it works really well, as the characters come off stoic and (for the most part) relatable. Julian&apos;s quest for redemption, Ju&apos;s attempt to emote again and Ruth&apos;s struggle to feel self-worthy, alongside Jan, &apos;the jailer&apos;, who finds himself in a purgatory of his own making, make for a soulful exploration. The gorgeous backdrop of the German countryside turns what could have otherwise been an average experience into a tactful bout of escapism. Embellished with moments of both sensitive and caricaturistic humour, the story is packaged tightly until the last fifteen minutes.\n\nThis brings me to the two limitations impairing my enjoyment. Firstly, it is guilty of romanticizing away the complexity of the story, as it needlessly and unsubtly provides outlines for both characters and themes. Secondly, the ending is drawn out and too sweet for comfort, as the mystery is shattered and the stars realign. \n\nThe reason why I would rather not dwell on these things, is because the cinematic journey managed to inspire me. Upon its conclusion, I had become all silly and was thinking about biking for days or heading out to an isolated cabin in the middle of the mountains. Director Baker- Monteys proves to be a good paysagist of the soul, if not quite the storyteller. There, everyone can be a little pretentious!",

It wasn&apos;t a great movie, but I am very glad I got to watch it! During a test of a low frequency transmitter two men and the transmitter disappear. A team is gathered to search the caves where the test took place. Caves that never before have been explored by man. But, what waits them below they could never imagine.\n\nThis story turns out quite original and I think that is maybe what makes the movie so good. The script is far from perfect, but it works. The acting is probably the best with the whole movie. It is generally good. The cinematography could, however, been better. I find it too boring. It&apos;s too straight. Though they did a pretty good job in creating the atmosphere and the mood. There were some pretty chilling sequences.\n\nWhen it comes to effects what can you expect from a 1984 B-movie? Well, they did OK on most of it, except for the monster. It was actually pretty bad and in fact personally I think they should have cut the whole monster. They way I see it, it rather took then give anything to the movie.\n\nI can recommend this movie because of it&apos;s story. There are few cliché there. As for the rest of this movie it is OK, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, well worth to watch.",

It is a great combination, and proof that Stallone was not just a star of the 80s -- he is just as strong here (and some would say he is still good in 2015).\n\nThis also happens to be one of those Julianne Moore films that has her as a main character before you realized that Moore was a big star. Maybe at this point it was more obvious, but it is quite surprising how many films she did before she was seen as an A-list actress.",

The actual dance itself is performed pretty well by the woman but the main attraction here is the hand tinted coloring. This period from Guy featured a lot of these colored films and it&apos;s really amazing at how well and professional they look even at this early stage. If you&apos;ve never seen this type of coloring then you&apos;re certainly going to be impressed by what&apos;s on display here."

      "reviewBody": "Jerzy Andrzejewski was the author of &apos; Ashes and Diamonds &apos; arguably Wajda&apos;s best film, adapted from the novel. The novel is justly considered a Polish masterpiece and the film is good, but this film, known as &apos; Gates to Paradise &apos; a novel written by Andrzejewski was too complex to bring to the screen, especially as Wajda himself considered the film a failure. The fact that the film deals with homosexuality was probably too distasteful for him to handle was probably the cause of it being a total failure. He must have known that Andrzejewski was a great writer and that in the book the subject matter was written experimentally in one long sentence, followed by a short sentence afterwards, and needed an equal experimental approach, and that the homosexuality was treated with a great deal of beauty. Instead of approaching it with understanding he made a clumsily flat film, without empathy or passion and cast it with actors that looked and acted very badly, due no doubt to his ham fisted direction. In colour and crudely dubbed it is a disaster that betrayed the author&apos;s intentions entirely. Polish film has no great record on portraying homosexuality and Wajda, knowing he was incapable of doing the book justice should have left it alone. As for the cast Ferdy Mayne was miscast as the so-called &apos; predator &apos; and he was out of his depth, missing out on the romantic aspects of the relationship with the youth he has had a relationship with. It should be re-filmed by a braver director and it would be an achievement for a Polish director to film it in Polish with Polish actors who thankfully understand their roles instead of making them one-dimensional puppets. It deserves its cinematic oblivion.",

The Greeks were philosophers and there is lots of talk, about everything from moral virtue to sin, to greed and hubris, friendship and love...you get the idea. People who liked Humanities and Contemporary Civilization in college will like this film a lot more than people whose idea of a good time is three hours of Mel Gibson causing bloody havoc. The battle scenes, while gory, are not as explicit as many blood-and-guts fans might be hoping for. Then, the male-male romance was tough on a lot of young guys on dates with their girlfriends. There were lots of nervous titters from young men. This film is ground-breaking, and for those who haven&apos;t come to terms with the fact of our universal innate bisexuality (re-read your Freud), it can be troubling. See this film in a trendy neighborhood with highly educated snobs, especially gay ones. You&apos;ll be a lot happier."

For an independent movie, this film has good production value and remembers and honors every soldier, no matter how small their role was in history.",

What sets this film apart from your routine crime caper/heist flick is that it features some very impressive and strong performances by Jada Pinkett-Smith (one of her very best roles) and Quen Latifah. Vivica Fox, Kimberly Elise and the underrated John C. McGinty were also quite effective in supporting roles. Blair Underwood, who I lilke, was sort of wasted as reverse eye candy. The love story sub plot was a bit if a distraction, only in a minor way. But at the core of this film was the bond between these ladies, all driven to rob banks for various reasons. What they all shared was their desperation. Instead of cliched cardboard characters, we are served pretty well fleshed out characters with as much depth as time allows. Some have mentioned they didn&apos;t like the ending, but I rather did. Queen Latifah was outstanding as a hardened career criminal. There is one scene where Jada&apos;s character stands up to her and it&apos;s tasty.\n\nAll in all, a pretty dang good thriller film that should be seen. The performances are what elevates it above the norm for this genre.",

      "name": "Mediocre Paella or Chorizo Western  by the horror expert Leon Klimovsky  at his first Tortilla film",
      "reviewBody": "Pryce (Luis Induni) is a land baron who wants to force Carter (Tomas Blanco) sell his lands , but he and his son Billy (George Martin) to be opposed to it . Later on , Billy goes to town saloon , where he meets Black Jack (Jack Taylor) , a hoodlum&apos;s Pryce , and it happens some violent brawls . Then , the corrupt sheriff (Aldo Sambrell) appears there and he detains Billy , but he , helped by a dog , swiftly escapes from jail . After that , the nasty Pryce and other powerful owners organize a raid to invade Carter&apos;s lands and cut the barbwire as well as the fences . But Pryce&apos;s daughter hears the plans and warns Carter (Tomás Blanco) and his wife (Tota Alba) , but Carter doesn&apos;t believe her . Soon after , Black Jack fires their home with unexpected consequences . As Billy seeks vendetta but then shows up an Union captain (Alberto Dalbes) who investigates the deeds and he supports the pursued Carter .\n\nThis Gazpacho Western is full of action , exaggerated characters , loads of go riding , double-crosses , but it also displays an exciting screenplay . Middlingly-staged action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody fights and brawls . It is full of thrilling events , shoot&apos;em up , fighting , treason and riding pursuits . It&apos;s a medium budget film with usual actors , acceptable technicians , passable production values and middling results . So-so Western regarding a revenge story , with plenty of violence , shoot&apos;em up , thrills and noisy action . Here the veteran director Klimovsky is partially inspired , though the ending is pretty predictable . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , George or Jorge Martin is decent in his usual tough role , here as Billy Carter , an brave farmer turned into gunslinger and desperately wanting to revenge a killing , but a ruthless Pistolero , Jack Taylor , is on his trail . Jorge played several Westerns , he worked much for Alfonso Balcazar&apos;s factory , such as : ¨Clint the strange¨, ¨The return the Clint¨, ¨Oeste Nevada Joe¨, Thompson 1880¨ , ¨Taste of killing¨, ¨A pistol for Ringo and ¨The return of Ringo¨ . This one is a moving and early western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist , a countryman becomes a gunslinger who is forced to make a fundamental choice about his life , against his relentless enemy , Jack Taylor , an extreme villain as well as racist who mistreats black people and kills mercilessly . George Martin is fine , he ravages the screen, rides , kills , shoots , hits and runs . There is plenty of thrills and action in the movie , guaranteeing some crossfires or stunts every few minutes . The film blends violence , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining . Anti-climatic and inappropriate score , in jazzy style , by Daniel White , Jesús Franco&apos;s regular , including some attractive and catching songs . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the ending gunfights and the customary confrontation finale . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and decent production design , being shot in Colmenar Viejo , La Pedriza , Manzanares Del Real , Madrid . \n\nThis ¨Tortilla¨ or ¨Paella¨or ¨Gazpacho¨ Western was professionally directed by Leon Klimovsky , though it has flops and gaps , being strictly a Western fodder . Leon was a craftsman who directed all kind of genres , as Terror for Paul Naschy : ¨Marshall of hell¨, ¨Rebellion of dead one¨ , ¨Orgy of vampires¨ , ¨Werewolf shadow¨, ¨Dr Jekill vs. the werewolf¨ , Warlike : ¨June 44 attack force Normandy¨ , ¨A bullet for Rommel¨ , ¨Bridge over Elba¨ and Western ¨¨Badland drifter¨ , ¨Reverend Colt¨ , ¨Torrejon city¨ , ¨Death knows no time¨ , ¨Two thousand dollars for Coyote¨ , ¨A dollar for Sartana¨ and &quot;A Few Dollars for Django&quot; which appears as director the Spanish/Argentinean Leon Klimovsky , but actually, for the most part of its filming by the disagreements arising with Klimovsky was realized by Enzo G. Castellari . Rating : 5 . Average .",

      "reviewBody": "This is not a comment to the movie itself. The bits I have seen show at least an accurate portrayal of rural Greece in the late 40&apos;s along with the political &quot;turmoil&quot; of the time. Acting was above average in general, although some members of the cast, notably Malkovich, could have done a slightly better job.\n\nSo, is this propaganda? Of course it is BUT with more grains of truth than your average propaganda film, especially an American made. Yes, Mr Gatzoyannis (unless he is ashamed to use his real family name and resorts to &quot;Gage&quot;) had lost his mother during the civil war. He is supposed to be one-sided, who wouldn&apos;t? He wrote a book about it, good for him. Someone made a film based on it, good for them. And now, many of us are bickering about what it is, propaganda or not, who are the good and who are the bad ones and so on...\n\nA commentator before said that war is the end of civilization. True! A civil war though makes an &quot;ordinary&quot; war look quite civilized and &quot;noble&quot;. Americans surely have their experience, they have gone through a terrible civil war. We, Greeks, have our experience which, sadly, is more &quot;fresh&quot; - lots of people that lived through it are still around to talk about it. Kids being taken from their mothers&apos; arms to be transported..where? Brother killing brother (literally!) and generally bringing down whatever was once dear. Who&apos;s the bad guy? Which brother gets moral high ground? The one who took to mountains, kidnapped young ones to put them through a grim life behind the Iron Curtain, laid waste to his land and his home? Or the other, who after suffering all that, imprisoned those left behind (the majority of which were not part of the armed struggle and suffered along too), exiled them to desolate barren islands (there are more than we need of those in the Aegean), made them &quot;dance&quot; with cats in a sack (interesting how democracy, or &quot;democracy&quot;, can be as horrendous as communism or any other totalitarian regime) and generally held them at the &quot;border&quot; of society until 1974. Who gets praise and who gets blame? You don&apos;t know? I think you do! \n\nHistory was always written by victors, this is no exception. What is an exception in this case is that this particular &quot;victor&quot; (Gage) abstained his country&apos;s drama until it &quot;suited&quot; him to be a part of it. Having lost a loved one, a parent, in war is no unique to him, millions of people did! Did he live the ongoing &quot;plague&quot; that the civil war was? From the comfort of his house, half a world away. It is almost as if I, who have never been to the US, write a book about the drama of the Indians. Whatever moral high ground he possessed he lessened being that &quot;distanced&quot; from the whole scenery of it and its consequences. In short, this book and film portray HIS side, not his ideology&apos;s side but his personal side. It is easy to place blame, very hard to do so for one side only! \n\nI will not go into the politics of that period, that is for another place and another time. Decent film, worth a viewing if not for anything else for an accurate portrayal of the &quot;scenery&quot;. No stars awarded as I have not seen it all, just bits and pieces."

Yes, there are a few &apos;jump out of your skin&apos; moments, but it really doesn&apos;t do anything we haven&apos;t seen before. For me, they revealed far too much of the creature far too soon; for horror to work well, it needs to be in the shadows. It&apos;s what the audience doesn&apos;t see that scares them; the imagination is a very powerful thing if manipulated correctly. The performances were all decent enough although nobody really stood out. On the plus side the running time was nice and short and the pace was kept pretty high throughout. Oh, and I have to admit, I love the ending! Sadly not quite enough for it to get my recommendation though.\n\nSteelMonster&apos;s verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 5.6/10\n\nYou can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t care what anyone else says, I found this movie to be hysterical. For one, it&apos;s pretty violent. People get it in disturbing ways here. One comes to mind in particular where someone gets a knitting needle rammed straight into their ear. It&apos;s not nice stuff but it&apos;s so funny you can&apos;t help but laugh. A major question, first and foremost: just what the hell was Vivica A. Fox doing in this movie? I&apos;ve never used the word slumming before in a sentence but I think it applies here. Devon Sawa is a cool cat. I liked him here and his brand of physical comedy is pretty impressive. Watch Final Destination after seeing this and I think you&apos;ll wonder why we haven&apos;t seen more of him. Seth Green is cool and so are Elden Henson and Jack Noseworthy. And for Jessica Alba fans, she&apos;s in here, in all her pre-Dark Angel glory. I&apos;ve never used the word nubile but I think it definitely applies here. She looks so good in this movie that it hurts my chest. She&apos;s one of the finer points (literally) of the movie. There&apos;s a chick in this movie wearing Paul Stanley&apos;s KISS makeup that should email me so I can give her my home address. There&apos;s parts of the movie that kinda fall flat but that&apos;s to be expected. Check this movie out if non-pc humor and bad mojo violence is your thing. Especially if you liked Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, I think you&apos;ll dig this picture. And if you appreciate Jessica Alba in any way. Rating: *** out of *****."

      "name": "A great comedy which may be crass and rude, but is not lacking in typical Python wit",
      "reviewBody": "The best thing about &quot;Monty Python&apos;s The Meaning of Life&quot; is without a doubt the short film that opens it. Directed by Terry Gilliam and originally conceived as an animated sequence, &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot; is a crucial step in Gilliam&apos;s career as a director. His previous two solo efforts as director, the inconsequential &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and the brilliant-in-its-own-way &quot;Time Bandits&quot; saw him developing his visual style much further than he did for his scenes for &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, with &quot;Time Bandits&quot; arguably being the first &apos;Gilliam-esque&apos; film he made. Still, &quot;Time Bandits&quot; didn&apos;t see his style fully developed, and &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot; is an even more bizarre film, but with a far more confident and clear-cut visual style. Simply put: Gilliam was ready for &quot;Brazil&quot;. This segment is the best in the film from a cinematic viewpoint, without a doubt, and even gives some of the other segments a run for their money in terms of the quality of the comedy, which involves office clerks who become pirates. Yes, it is quite strange.\n\nThe issue a lot of people have with &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; is that it is crass and rude and even sillier than the Python standard. It&apos;s shock humor, but for the majority of the sections of the film work so well and are so clever even in their lack of class that I would not hesitate to put &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; on the same level as &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, though it&apos;s not as good as &quot;Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail&quot;. That&apos;s not to say this isn&apos;t &apos;Python-esque&apos;, because it&apos;s very much so, they&apos;re just completely liberated by the medium of film to say and do whatever they please. Indeed, there&apos;s something in here to offend nearly anyone, but there&apos;s also a fair bit in here to please everyone, even a wonderful scene in which Gilliam&apos;s &apos;supporting feature&apos; &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot; suddenly intrudes on the events of the film.\n\n&quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; is constructed as a series of skits, and though many have suggested that it is hence not as much of a narrative movie as their previous two efforts. I tend to disagree with this viewpoint. Yes, this film is a series of skits, but they are all elaborately set up within an overarching &apos;commentary&apos; on the general theme of the movie, the title. There is one section of the film which is both entirely unnecessary and honestly quite bad is &apos;The Autumn Years&apos;, an unfunny and vile piece centered around Terry Jones in a fat-suit repeatedly vomiting and eventually exploding. Basically all of the rest of the film is very, very funny, and even the jokes which fall flat within scenes like &quot;Live Organ Transplants&quot; and &quot;Death&quot; don&apos;t go terribly wrong because the overall quality of the scenes and sections are so high and the concepts behind them very funny. Gilliam&apos;s animations work excellently within the film and this would sadly be the last time we saw a distinctive Gilliam animation within a major film.\n\n&quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; is great comedy. It&apos;s crass and rude and goes for cheap humor often, but it&apos;s mostly handled with a great deal of wit and intelligence that elevates even the section involving the world&apos;s most pornographic sex education class to a high level. Perhaps in retrospect this film&apos;s flaws are more obvious than those &quot;Life of Brian&quot; suffers from, but both are ultimately on the same level.\n\n9/10"

The dialogue does feel corny to me, Karen Morley overacts dreadfully that it was difficult to take her hysteria seriously and Lewis Stone makes a piece of wood more animated. However, the black and white cinematography does show crispness and atmosphere and the sets and costumes are beautiful. The score is haunting and while occasionally silly the story is fun and never felt dull. The tortures were both scary and amusing, and I got some entertainment from the scene with the crocodiles. While Charles Starrett is not the most convincing of actors he does make up for it by his sexiness. The two best performances come from Myrna Loy and especially Boris Karloff. Loy is lustful and incredibly magnetic, while Karloff seems to be having the time of his life.\n\nAll in all, The Mask of Fu Manchu is a flawed film but it is a decent and fun one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "THE IMPOSTORS (1998) ***\n\nStarring: Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci, Lili Taylor, Steve Buscemi, Campbell Scott, Isabella Rossellini, Billy Connolly, and Hope Davis Written and directed by: Stanley Tucci   Running Time: 102 minutes   Rated R (for some language and sex-related material)   By Blake French:\n\n\tCertain movies are just not for all audiences. Stanley Tucci directs the new comedy, who is one of the creators of the 1995 drama-comedy &quot;Big Night.&quot; The film is certainly not for everyone. It will satisfy fans of screwball comedies, and perhaps fans of someone in the cast-they may enjoy it. However, I only liked &quot;The Impostors&quot; because of the laughs it brought along with its well-written script. It is not your typical comedy. Now, I&apos;m not saying that this movie is great. I am saying, however, that this movie satisfied me to the point of a recommendation.\n\n  \t&quot;The Impostors&quot; opens with a hilarious sequence in which the two main stars, Tucci and Platt, play two out of work actors, Maurice &amp; Arthur, who play on a silent stage who have serious and comical problems with women, coffee, and each other. \n\nMaurice &amp; Arthur get in to trouble and escape from the police in a boarding box. However, while they were sleeping, the box was loaded onto a ship carrying an assortment of bizarre passengers that provoke even more laughs. They include a Nazi steward with tight lips, Lily, the social director who helps Maurice &amp; Arthur, a First Mate who is a mad bomber, a tennis pro who is aggressively gay, an ex-queen  in despair entertainer who wants to commit suicide, and many more.\n\n \tThe films casting was more to my liking than any other movie I have seen this year. The characters fit the actors so perfectly and realistically that I could have been fooled that these people were actually victims of a secret tapping of  &quot;Candid Camera.&quot; Each of them bring a story to themselves outside the plot. No one character is at the mercy of the script.\n\n As for the script itself, it kept its cool even as it organized its own extremely complicated chaos. There are many laughs that evolve from hyperactive activity from the assortment of characters because there is such a variety, everything feels so fresh in this movie. \n\n&quot;The Impostors&quot; is an opinion based movie. Certain film&apos;s don&apos;t carry massive plot holes, obvious flaws, or any other structural or character problem, but they don&apos;t necessarily bring anything overwhelmingly powerful to the big screen either. &quot;The Impostors&quot; is this kind of comedy. Whether you find it to your liking or not will totally depend on your taste in comic material in film. I was amused by the picture. Many filmgoers will differ on my opinion though. The individual I screened the film longed for its conclusion and declared this was the worst movie she had seen in her life. I recommend the film, but take into account your personal feelings on my review before you make a judgment call. &quot;The Impostors&quot; might make you laugh uncontrollably, but it also may cause you  to turn your head in pitiful despise. \n\nBrought to you by Fox Searchlight Pictures.",

The scenes of Tonio walking around New York give an impressive picture of New York from its good and bad sides. The city has a more realistic feel to it than you can find in many American films of the time. Peculiar too is the fascinating mixture of Christian and pagan ritual in the Dolomite town. The pagan festivities have a rawness to them that one no longer experiences in the processions and celebrations of modern-day German speaking areas. As the film was made in 1934, there is obviously some propaganda involved, but it is nevertheless a unique documentation of the time.",

(with commercials ugh) I&apos;ve seen it a few times before and every time I watch it, I bawl like a baby and I&apos;m a guy. A really tough guy. But this movie goes straight to my heart and puts a squeeze on it through the wonderful music, the sweet nostalgia and what a cast!\n\nIlleana Douglas is beautiful and she really plays her character with great talent. She&apos;s supported by a strong cast and how can you go wrong with Turturro playing Phil Specter? The first time I saw this there was something familiar about the music; the songs, like &quot;God give me Strength&quot;. As much as I like Elvis Costello, that scene of Illeana performing it for Matt (Brian Wilson) Dillon was such a unique delivery of a pure and powerful vocal. I later found that the &apos;familiarity&apos; is Burt Bacharach and the &apos;voice&apos; is Kristin Vigard: Wow! \n\nBack in those days there was such an explosion of music and creativity and Burt Bacharach was truly a pop force.\n\nI loved the Brill Building scenes, especially when they were working on the songs. I thought the movie lost something when it moved west to California but was deeply moved by Douglas and Turturro &apos;having it out&apos; at the empty poolside. The final song with the flashbacks and her crowning achievement of recording that &quot;one great album&quot; had me weeping again. I really like this movie so I ordered the DVD online.",

This movie would have been av &quot;section&quot; 8, without any doubt, if it wasn&apos;t for the bad acting. The soundtrack is also superb with bands like Kjøtt and Raga Rockers. The violence is also portrayed quite realistic and without to much blood. Honour is an important theme in the name and as the title says in norway, &quot;Livet er en æresak&quot; Translated, &quot;Life is matter of honour&quot; The movie contains several humoristic scenes which fits the film nicely.

Joe Pendleton is so sweet and earnest that he deserve a happy, fairy-tale ending.  I don&apos;t think the script ever descends into sappiness and there is a fine ensemble cast.

      "name": "A long haunting puzzle that&apos;s never really put together",
      "reviewBody": "Not as strong as Zvyagintsev&apos;s haunting 2003 debut &apos;The Return&apos;/&apos;Vozvrashcheniye&apos; (grand prize at Venice--I reviewed it when it was shown theatrically in the US the following year), this adaptation of William Saroyan&apos;s 1953 novella, &quot;The Laughing Matter,&quot; is recognizable for its intense, slow-paced style and beautiful cinematography (by Mikhail Krichman). &apos;Izgnanie&apos; (the Russian title) takes us out to a remote country house where there are thin roads, grassy fields over gentle hills, herds of sheep -- and old friends, because this is the childhood home of the protagonist Alex (Konstantin Lavronenko), who&apos;s brought his family out there for summer vacation. But before that (and a signal of a certain disjointedness of the whole film) we observe Mark (Alexander Baluev), Alex&apos;s obviously gangsterish brother, getting him to remove a bullet from his arm. this is also the first of a series of failures to seek adequate medical treatment. Now we move to Alex with his wife Vera (Maria Bonnevie) taking their young son Kir (Maxim Shibaev) and younger daughter Eva (Katya Kulkina) out to the country by car.\n\nZvagintsev certainly takes his time with every action of the film. It&apos;s as if he thought he was writing a 500-page novel rather than making a movie. The effect is not so much a sense of completeness as a kind of hypnotic trance. Everything is marked by the fine clear light, the frequent use of long shots, and the pale blue filters that give everything a distinctive look. Some of the long landscape shots are absolutely stunning, and the interior light and the way shadows gently caress the faces are almost too good to be true.\n\nWhen another family comes into the picture and they all spend a day outdoors, the sense of familiarity, summer listlessness, and vague unease made me think of a play by William Inge or Tennessee Williams. That may seem odd for a Russian movie, but the names are only partly Russian, the location is deliberately indeterminate, and Saroyan&apos;s source story is set in a long-ago California, not in Russia. Zvyagintsev doesn&apos;t seem to work in the real world but in some kind of super-real nether-land. Whether it is unforgettable or simply off-putting seems to vary. In &apos;The Return&apos; it as the former; here it is more the latter.\n\nVera drops a bombshell, when she announces she&apos;s pregnant and that the child isn&apos;t his. The tragedy that slowly but inexorably follows arises from a derangement in the wife and a misunderstanding by the husband. To deal with the problem Alex wants the children out of the way and he is happy to have them stay at the friends&apos; house, where they&apos;re putting together a large jigsaw puzzle of Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s painting, &apos;The Annunciation&apos;. I&apos;m indebted to Jay Weissberg&apos;s review in &apos;Variety&apos; for this identification; Weissberg adds, &quot;That... isn&apos;t the only piece of heavy-handed religious imagery on offer. There&apos;s Alex washing his brother&apos;s blood off his hands, Eva/Eve offered an apple, and a Bible recitation from 1 Corinthians about love (&quot;It does not insist on its own way&quot;), handily set apart by a bookmark depicting Masaccio&apos;s &apos;The Expulsion From the Garden of Eden.&apos; OK, we get it, but that doesn&apos;t mean the parallels offer a doorway into personalities who offer little emotional residue on their own.&quot; And he is right: Zvyagintsev&apos;s fascination with Italian painting, and here also with the Bible, doesn&apos;t change the fact that the characters nonetheless remain, this time, troublingly opaque. Mark is an adviser and stimulus to action for Alex. Robert (Dmitry Ulianov) is a third brother who enters the picture later. I will not go into the details because the chief interest of the film is its slow revelations.\n\nAnd yet the revelations don&apos;t quite convince, because for one thing they do not fully explain. The wife&apos;s behavior remains unaccountable. And a long flashback in the latter part of the film seems to come too late, and to explain too much, yet without explaining enough. None of this is the fault of the actors, who are fine, including the children.\n\nZvyagintsev&apos;s second film, then, is a disappointment and a puzzlement. I began to think after a while that the whole thing would be much more effective if it were done in a very simple style, with simply workmanlike photography, in a film trimmed of all externals, down to the bone, something noirish like Robert Siodmak&apos;s &apos;The Killers&apos; or Kubrick&apos;s &apos;The Killing.&apos; We are left to figure things out anyway, so why all the flourishes? Yet Zvyagintsev&apos;s style is nonetheless beautiful, and one only hopes he finds material that works better for him next time. I was thrilled with &apos;The Return&apos; and wrote of it in my IMDb Comment: &quot;This stunning debut features exceptional performances by the talented young actors, brilliant storytelling in a fable-like tale that&apos;s as resonant as it is specific, and exquisite cinematography not quite like any one&apos;s ever seen before.&quot; The excitement I felt about the first film is why the new one feels like such a let-down.\n\nSeen as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series Film Comment Selects 2008 (February 25) at the Walter Reade Theater, NYC.\n\n__________________",

      "reviewBody": "The ingredients are here for a passable political-thriller but the approach used to tell the story is numbingly routine. Investigator Franco Nero pursues his case simply through a series of interviews, thus allowing the movie to present its roster of marquee-names -- Christopher Lee, Eli Wallach, Claudia Cardinale, etc. -- in a succession of talky, static scenes that lack interest and vitality. (Though these interviews provide an opportunity to show off a series of impressively furnished and decorated rooms.) And then, when it comes time for Nero to present his solution to the case, he does so by showing to a group of people a movie which simply re-caps information gleaned from his interviews!\n\nAttempts to liven up the proceedings with spurts of action merely serve to emphasize the overall dullness of the movie. For example, when Nero falls into the clutches of a villain known as &quot;the Surgeon&quot; who is determined to torture information from him, we only see Nero -- stripped to a jockstrap and strapped to a chair -- being given an injection with a hypodermic needle. Surely this is one of the most boring forms of torture ever shown on the screen.",

Every time I start watching one of those, I feel as if the plot is derivative and the formula is getting worn out, but somehow the film in question always turns out entertaining and sufficiently innovative. &quot;The Man with the Glass Eye&quot; is special and memorable enough for a couple of reasons. It&apos;s a Krimi in color, with a couple of grisly murder sequences and clever twists. It&apos;s also the first German Wallace-adaptation I&apos;ve seen that doesn&apos;t star Eddi Arent in the pitiable comic-relief role. This responsibility is taken over by Stefan Behrens (as a Sgt. With a squeaky voice) and Hubert Von Meyerinck (as the ignorant chief of Scotland Yard). Although they hardly share any scenes together, &quot;The Man with the Glass Eyes&quot; also unites Horst Tappert and Fritz Wepper, five years before they would star together in the most successful (I think) German TV-series ever, namely &quot;Derrick&quot;. The most disturbing character in this film is, hands down, a spooky ventriloquist who has dummies with gigantic heads and he makes them call him &quot;daddy&quot;. In fact, he even makes them talk when there isn&apos;t an audience around. Bizarre.",

      "reviewBody": "Once in a great, great while, a motion picture reaches out from the confines of the screen to implant a spark of purest wonder in the heart! . The film starts in a long flashback narrated by Marcelino , he tells how an abandoned baby is picked up by monks residing in a monastery ruled by a humble Father Superior (Fernando Fernan Gomez) . Marcelino (Nicolo Paolucci) is a miserable orphan who grows up in the monastery . The little boy named Marcelino who lost his mother and became a pure and simple of heart kid devoted friend of Crucified Jesus . Meanwhile, he gets into mischiefs , he plays and puts nicknames to monks , as Brother Door , Brother Cookie , Brother Bad , Fray Papilla (Alfredo Landa) and Brother Ding Dong . Marcelino wishes to see his mother . One day , a wealthy count , in search of a child to raise , decides to adopt Marcelino and to bring him up in his fortress . He dresses him in luxurious attire and gives him a strict education . But Marcelino feels sad there and escapes to convent . One day when he falls ill is carried a room full of old things , there he finds at the loft to Jesus and gives a piece of his bread to an old wooden Jesus figure - and indeed it takes the bread and eats it . Getting a wish granted for his donation . But in some touching scenes , Marcelino again gives him bread and wine , then happen an ecstasy at the ending .\n\nSpanish/Italian/French co-production dealing with a sensitive story proceeded in simplicity and delicacy by Lugi Comencini as when a marvelous friendship between Jesus and Marcelino is born . This a sensible and feeling movie full of mirth , humor touches and enjoyable message based on a novel by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva . At the same time the film gives us an agreeable panorama about monastery life , its pity and goodness ; furthermore , the oration , sacrifice , work , companionship and various situations happen in monastic existence . Its perfect developing resides on superb characters well played by all casting monks and the sympathy , simplicity of Nicolo-Marcelino , but inferior to unforgettable kid played by Pablito Calvo. Musical score by Florenzo Carpi responds appropriately to the ambient , originating a religious atmosphere , though extremely sweet . Precious and luminous cinematography who give us an accurate scenario of the times is developed . The motion picture is professionally directed by Luigi Comencini but is justly inferior to version filmed by Hungarian Ladislao Vadja , that was one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s and touched the hearts of numerous spectators around the world . This modern rendition resulted to be a flop and failed at box office .",

The difference between fight scenes at night vs broad daylight may not seem like a big deal, but for some reason it really stood out to me. It just feels like this one was more geared toward kids, and potentially selling action figures. I didn&apos;t hate it by any means, but it really lacked what made the first one so unique, and intriguing to me.",

This movie is actually decent and surprised me with some nice scares and VERY creepy atmosphere. \n\nThis movie uses the whole camera &quot;found-footage&quot; view (as it name says), but this was actually done pretty well for once as far as scares come. The movie has really great atmosphere at some parts and will creep you out at certain scenes along with some well-timed jump scares and loud sounds.\n\nThe let down of this film is that it could have been SO much better and it had a crappy ending. I believe it&apos;s because of the way the film was plotted. The movie should have had a different route/story that allowed for more scares because that&apos;s what I really enjoyed about this film.\n\nOverall, the movie is decent. Still worth a watch if you have free time and if you like these kinds of movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Bats is a very generic late-&apos;90s killer animal flick that follows most of the genre rules to the letter. All of the expected characters are present and correct—untrustworthy government scientist, brave local sheriff, doomed-to-die deputy, dedicated (and sexy) animal expert, wise-cracking sidekick—and the plot develops in an extremely predictable manner, opening with young couple alone in the dark falling victim to the bats, before introducing a whole townful of potential victims, and climaxing with our brave heroes risking their lives in a showdown against the deadly critters.\n\nIt all gets very silly at times, with perhaps the most unbelievable scene being the securing and electrification of a whole school by just four people in the space of a few hours, but it still proves to be quite a bit of fun, director Louis Morneau keeping the action moving at such a swift pace that such nonsense is fairly easy to forgive (unlike the director&apos;s tendency to &apos;skew&apos;, stretch and blur the image during the frenzied bat attacks, which I found bloody irritating).\n\nWhat really helps to elevate this formulaic nonsense to slightly-above-average are the solid cast and some fairly decent special effects. Dina Meyer (of Starship Troopers fame) and Lou Diamond Phillips make for a likable protagonists, and Leon is far less objectionable as &apos;token comedy relief black guy&apos; than one might expect. As for the bats, they&apos;re a mixture of more than reasonable CGI and nifty puppetry from KNB; my only gripe, FX-wise, is a lack of splatter—a bit more gore would have been very welcome.",

Even more surprising is that the superb Maureen O&apos;Hara was Flynn&apos;s co-star, and therefore I can only guess that since her otherwise fantastic acting skills were also lagging in the film, I will chalk up the film&apos;s lousy performances to bad directing. Thank goodness for this remake; It&apos;s tied (with Overland Stage, &amp; Barbary Coast) as my favorite acting performance of Doug McClure, who, if given the opportunity, could have been a blonde Tyrone Power; this film is the proof of that.",

      "reviewBody": "Some guys make a movie that looks like a bomb but splashes on screen like just another pebble in the water, but jaane tu yaa jaane naa is definitely not that type of movie. Its a movie everyone can connect with but cant predict at the same time, totally down-to-earth yet entertaining. There&apos;s been a lot of expectations from the movie as everyone was wondering if aamir khan the producer could deliver another movie of the kind after a spectacular feature presentation called Taare Zameen Par.\n\nWhat seemed really likable to me was the unique story telling experience where you get the feeling that you are listening to your own friends telling you a story. Its difficult to retell it without the help of these friends who blended so well with the story. The complex nature of the relation between a boy and a girl, their bonding, separation and other aspects of the story sound like a typical love movie but there is freshness in this approach. All characters fall in place and don&apos;t seem to dominate each other. The dialogues are very memorable...my personal favorite is about the &quot;Violent Streak&quot;\n\nRatna Pathak who plays the protective mom and Naseerudin Shah who plays the royal father have taken funny scenes to the best possible level.\n\nGinelia looked convincing in her role but she needs to work on her voice a bit. She has her shining moments and delivers well.\n\nFinally this movie was about Imran khan and like its ending the best part is reserved for him. He is bound to become the next chocolaty hero after this movie but its a long journey for him right now which he has started with a big leap. His simple next door boy looks combined with good comic timing and right kind of acting will win him a lot of fans.\n\nThis movie is good to watch with friends preferably college friends because it brings out a lot of shared fun moments one has had in the past. Please don&apos;t miss it or you will be sorry. Thanks Aamir Khan for making this movie!!",

      "reviewBody": "I could have sworn I saw the name Joseph E. Levine in the opening credits but it&apos;s not listed in his IMDb CV which is strange since I was reminded throughout of Joe&apos;s sanitized, highly fictionalized biopix, HARLOW and THE CARPETBAGGERS, filmed like an episode of TV&apos;s THE UNTOUCHABLES. Based on the best-selling memoirs of the Roaring Twenties&apos; most notorious madam, Polly Adler, A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME was a hoot and a half thanks to too-old-for-the-role Shelley Winters&apos; silly bag of thespic tricks. Make that schticks. As a teen-aged Polish immigrant working in a sweatshop, a kerchiefed Shelley acts like Lucy Ricardo in the chocolate factory and when she meets gangster Robert Taylor (looking haggard and embarrassed) and is too shy to speak, she comes off as more than mildly retarded. Young Polly on her dates looks like the guys are out with their mother and there&apos;s one particular scene in a parked car that reminded me of Kim Stanley&apos;s embarrassing teen turn in THE GODDESS which, ironically, was a role Shelley would have been perfect for. As pretty (?) Polly rises from naive noodnik to NYC&apos;s most influential madam thanks to Bob&apos;s sponsorship, the underworld meet the elite while political deals are struck in a brothel that looks more like a parlor call from the parish priest than a house of pleasure. Here&apos;s a contemporary review:\n\n&quot;Something was missing in this picture and to be blunt about it, the missing ingredient is sex! There is hardly a suggestion of it. It may or may not discourage impressionable young girls from a life of sin, but it certainly is enough to keep anyone away from the movie!&quot; \n\nOutside of the anecdotal (which couldn&apos;t be told), there wasn&apos;t much of a story so the movie becomes one long cautionary tale on the perils of prostitution which must have pleased the soon-to-be-out-of-a-job censors no end. Polly&apos;s girls reap only drug addiction and suicide while Shelly wrings her hands trying to help and the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer message is a woman who goes that route forfeits any right to love and happiness. The ladies looked lovely, however, and although Edith Head&apos;s gowns paid no attention to period detail, I caught a quick glimpse of Raquel Welch filling out one of them but I couldn&apos;t spot Edy Williams except in a photograph during the opening credits. It&apos;s directed by Russell Rouse, the auteur responsible for the 1966 laugh riot, &quot;The Oscar&quot;, and has a Burt Bacharach title tune I forgot as soon as it was over. Helping to lend a TV air to it all were &quot;special guest stars&quot; (love them) like Broderick Crawford and Cesar Romero (as Lucky Luciano) paying lip service to near non-existent plot development but whenever my tastes are accused of being too lowbrow, I usually point with pride to the Academy Award-winning Shelley Winters. Why?? Shelley&apos;s down there with the best of them and although she&apos;s very good at things like blowzy, I now find her range rather limited -and that&apos;s OK. &quot;Com&apos;on Polly, do Theda Bara!&quot; Indeed.",

Everything about the movie is poor, story-line, plot, acting, it is so boring it is unbelievable. Just a bunch of useless violence. Yes Samuel is a great actor and has done such great movies, and after watching &quot;pulp fiction&quot; again a few weeks back, I am so disappointed that he accepted to star in this movie.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to include the bad movie rating, Every actors in the movie should have a star taken off a previously made one for accepting to take part in this useless piece of garbage. \n\nTotally USELESS"

      "name": "Edgar Wright&apos;s precious little movie",
      "reviewBody": "Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-something slacker living in Toronto, who basically leeches off his friends. Despite being in a &quot;relationship&quot; with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he keeps dreaming about another girl. He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.\n\nI did not think it was possible, but Edgar Wright has fairly successfully brought Bryan Lee O&apos;Malley&apos;s epic graphic novel series to the big screen in the most uniquely entertaining way possible. It is his first adapted work, but it feels every bit as fresh (I use that word very loosely) as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did upon their initial releases. It deviates from the books a bit (much like Matthew Vaughn&apos;s excellent adaptation of Kick-Ass earlier this year), but the majority of the film stays true to the series and gives the fans everything they might expect from a Scott Pilgrim film. Right after the film opening with an 8-bit Universal logo and score, you know you are in for a treat.\n\nWhat propels Wright&apos;s epic and inspired vision is the editing style. All of the little idiosyncrasies, background/foreground items and ideas, everything that made O&apos;Malley&apos;s books so revered in the graphic novel community are all in full force here. Some shots in the trailers suggest the comic book-style feel of the film, with the sounds of the actions appearing as words on-screen and the video game-related pop-ups appearing the same way they would in the game. But that is only the start. The entire film is filled with them, and with references to numerous pop culture entities (specifically video games), to the point that it looks and sounds like a ridiculously enhanced motion comic or game. Add to that the quick cuts and multiple panel style of the format, and you have the closest film representation of a comic since Robert Rodriguez attacked Frank Miller&apos;s Sin City.\n\nEven with all the nods and references to the original work, Wright&apos;s film still feels very much his own work. He makes Scott Pilgrim&apos;s epic quest to defeat Ramona&apos;s exes into an understated work you will likely not see replicated too soon. After seeing Christopher Nolan&apos;s Inception just under a week ago, I did not think that mainstream Hollywood would release something so blazingly original and something so astonishly unique so close together. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not nearly as strong a film as Nolan&apos;s masterpiece is, but Wright has clearly given it his all here. He has sidestepped away from following the lead of other comic book/graphic novel-style films, and has created something he can truly be proud of. The visuals on display are simply remarkable, and are worth the price of a ticket all on their own. The musical choices are even better. If you have seen the trailers, you are merely only getting a hint for what Wright has in store for you here.\n\nIf I do have an issue, it is that the film is a little too exposition-heavy in the first half, and way too jumpy in the second. It never loses its tone or its style, but it becomes all too blatantly obvious where the books stop and the deviation begins. The pacing here is also a touch off, and on further research, thoroughly suggests there is material missing or altered from the final cut of the film. I understand that Wright and his co-writer Michael Bacall wanted to set-up the story and where it plans on going for the few who venture into the film without having read a single issue, but there is too much detail given in those early scenes, and not enough to pivotal moments later in the film.\n\nAnother gripe, although it is one I hope will be less bothersome on repeat viewings, is that a good chunk of the characters feel incredibly underused. The books are stacked to the brim with an eclectic mix of supporting characters, who are present in the film, but they feel very stunted and get absolutely no development. Kim Pine (Alison Pill) is a very important character in the books, but she merely appears in the background here and delivers some of the best dialogue. Wallace Wells (the absolutely incredible scene-stealer Kieran Culkin) is the moral centre and source of an incredible amount of exposition, but he is barely in the film after the first half. Envy Adams (Brie Larson) almost feels like an extended cameo as opposed to an indispensible figure in Scott&apos;s character development. But then, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and especially Jason Schwartzman all deliver stunning performances as three of Ramona&apos;s exes, despite the lack of time on-screen.\n\nCera on the other hand, is perfect as Pilgrim. The character plays a little too close to his stereotypical neurotic and off-centre archetype, but it works out beautifully here. He makes the character real, and brings a depth to Scott Pilgrim that no other young actor could. He has the right look and the right sound down pat. It was a little weird to see him get so physical in some sequences, but this is a vintage fit for Cera. Although they are downplayed more than I liked, Winstead and Wong are great as Ramona and Knives. They both have a certain edge throughout the film, and even at its most ridiculous, deliver strong performances. It helps too that they have insanely good chemistry with Cera.\n\nI jumped at the idea of an advanced screening of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and I do not regret seeing the film in the slightest. It is a bit of a niche movie, but it is one that is lovingly made through and through.\n\n8/10.\n\n(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",

Bava&apos;s camera-work is exemplary and his special effects are apparent in the over-the-top violence, particularly towards the end.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; is the 1990 sequel to the 1984 box office hit &quot;Gremlins&quot; which is one of my all-time favorite movies. The sequel is not as good as the original, but its not bad either. Here the filmakers did something different. They tried to make this one more of a comedy than the original. The first film was funny but also scary. &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; plays more like a Mel Brooks-type movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus, it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking, smoking, etc. Nevertheless, this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I&apos;d wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years, it would have done better. In between the two &quot;Gremlins&quot; flicks there were all those ripoffs (&quot;Critters&quot;, &quot;Ghoulies&quot; and their sequels) and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all. But the two &quot;Gremlins&quot; movies are much better than the &quot;Critters&quot; and &quot;Ghoulies&quot; movies. A good job by director Joe Dante.\n\n*** (out of four)",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.\n\nNow that&apos;s out of the way, there&apos;s a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn&apos;t. It&apos;s a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it&apos;s transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.\n\nAs for everything else, well... that&apos;s when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight&apos;s Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.\n\nHowever, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox&apos;s acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don&apos;t say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).\n\nAnother major gripe I have is Bay&apos;s ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).\n\nI could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya&apos;s cameo, Sam&apos;s friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?) \n\n(Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I&apos;ve seen in theaters in years.)",

Today You Die is a pretty poor movie, however with stuff like Submerged and particularly Out for a Kill, Seagal has done worse. The photography and editing aren&apos;t as slipshod or as dull as they can be, Nick Mancuso is good and the final explosion is spectacular. Even Seagal is better than usual, however that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean he was good, in fact it was still a lazy performance but at least the lines were intelligible. The action didn&apos;t do much for me, because of the sluggish pace in general of the film, it felt unexciting, while the plot is derivative with too many plot holes to push a delivery truck through, Treech is very irritating, the script is really quite dumb in places and the soundtrack was not to my taste, too loud and overdone. All in all, a poor film but not among Seagal&apos;s worst. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is really &quot;bad&quot;, in jokes-are-over style, and is comparable to the &quot;Sole cruise&quot; (Odinochnoe plavanie). The movie core is a die-but-do (Americans say &quot;do-or-die&quot;) every-second-costs-life situation. American military sub being on cruise missile launch drills in the outer sea suffers a severe pile malfunction which leads to uncontrolled launch of two nuclear cruise missiles aimed at the USSR mainland. Well, quite a bold premise for the plot, but still tolerable, if to remember historical USAF loosing nukes. Sub&apos;s mechanic receives a LD of radiation, goes berserk, and sends mayday despite of commander&apos;s no. The mayday is received by Soviet Red Army. An immediate phone talk between Soviet and US commanders ensues. Soviets send a repair crew to the sub, an action that takes a feat of long-range aviation crew, that nearly costs them life. Americans play a double-face game, officially not rejecting help, but in reality trying to deny to Russians the access to the sub by any means. What is an excusable behavior for the military, but greatly overdone, as if a repair crew can steal some secret of the sub&apos;s construction or the US crew&apos;s Sunday menu or I don&apos;t know what. May be they simply don&apos;t want to let guests in the sub because they have mess and dust in their living rooms, you know, empty coca cola cans full of stubs lying everywhere around , and no time to clean the rooms. Anyway Americans are very very uncooperative and prefer to lock horns with Russians on every single instance. While the whole thing smells of WWIII. The movie displays lots of Russian and American tech, more Russian, and most important, in action, controlled by very persuasive die-but-do characters on both sides. The movie features a certain research of the psychology of the characters.",

      "reviewBody": "A Spanish post-war drama directed by Jose Luis Cuerda and based on the novel of Alberto Mendez of the same title.\n\nThe story is set in the Spanish city of Orense, in Northern Spain, in the 1940s, and tells the story of a family of communists struggling to survive after the victory of the fascists in 1939. The father Ricardo -played by Javier Camera- declared dead, lives hidden in the family basement with his subversive and prohibited books, and types works on his wife&apos;s behalf to earn some money. The mother, Elena -played by Maribel Verdu- lives and acts as a widow who makes ends meet by sewing and typing. Their teenage daughter Elenita and her boyfriend Lalo -played by Irene Escolar and Martin Rivas- are involved in guerrilla activities but try to escape the country, while child Lorenzo -played by Roger Princep- goes to the children school in town. There, Gonzalo gets the eye of Fr Salvador -played by Raul Arevalo- a seminarian and fascist ex-soldier who feels immediately attracted to Elena.\n\nThe script is mediocre with stereotypical characters, predictable plot and events, and, most importantly, without emotion or heart. A soulless movie despite telling a story that should be moving and thought-provoking, and it ends being just pretentious. Nothing new in the exploration of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nRegarding the acting, Maribel Verdú and Javier Camera do not believe what they are playing, and their performances are mediocre, much below their acting abilities and quality. Raul Arevalo is good in his portray of the confused tempted priest. The rest of the supporting actors are OK in their roles, but child Roger Princep was awful to watch.\n\nThere is nothing excellent or memorable about the film, just mediocrity. To be honest, the things I liked the most about this film were its atmosphere, the views of the Orense&apos;s city, and the title. While watching this movie I thought of a similar movie which, instead, showed all what this lacked in this - the Butterfly&apos;s Tongue.\n\nDespite the script being so poor, perhaps because the novel was not, the scriptwriters won a Goya -the Spanish Oscar- to the best script in 2008. The movie was also selected to represent the Spanish cinema in the Oscars in the same year, but did not make the final cut.",

Jeah, there are just a few sentences spoken in this one, but that&apos;s not a big problem. However, when there are dialogs, they are great, funny and full of sadism. The story is not that spectacular, but the actors are doing their best. Frank Wolff, armed with a machine gun, shoots, shoots and shoots. However, he is not able to stop the stranger(Tony Anthony). And Tony takes revenge with his sawed-off shot gun. Moreover, &quot;Un dollaro tra i denti&quot; has a wonderful music score by Benedetto Ghiglia.Just breath-taking. This is definitely not a bad spaghetti-western. Let&apos;s say an underrated masterpiece. But keep in mind, you have to see it UNCUT. Otherwise it will be really boring.",

Oh well, it was the Fifties, I suppose. At least we get Robert Loggia in an early role. Of course, he isn&apos;t onscreen as much as all the stock footage of jets and war rooms and the only thing holding the movie together is an intrusive narration. Still, sci-fi movies of that era are fun as long as you don&apos;t think about them too much. And the dialogue is fun, too. A man runs up to our hero and tells him a hotline just opened to the Pentagon &quot;It&apos;s a red alert, situation yellow!&quot; Well, that doesn&apos;t sound too bad; if it was really bad it would be red-red, right?

      "reviewBody": "The basic story has significant promise It is based upon the actual disappearance of a young Massachusetts girl in 1755. There is plenty to work with: a local ghostly legend, a family curse, family secrets, greed, an ancient property dispute brought into modern times.\n\nA story of modern greed, outsiders drawn into an insular town, a grieving mother unsuspecting their family has bought cursed ground. Add in ghosts and the hint of possession and you seem to have all the elements for a great horror film.\n\nYet, something is lacking. This film never lives up to its premise. It is a decent film, but never gets scary enough to be horror, and the end bursts on you so quickly the history-repeating angle gets thrown in right at the end. Enjoyable, but disappointing in that it fails to live up to its possibilities.",

Half of the show was &quot;White folks vs. Black folks.&quot; If these comedians want to continue rebuilding the wall of intolerance, then I hope that they aren&apos;t allowed to make any more movies. I was disturbed by what these men thought that they knew anything about me by the color of my skin. Leave the prejudice behind. One can still be funny talking about how they were raised or about how their family/friends act, but generalizing actions to an entire race is flat-out wrong. I am ashamed to say that I stayed throughout the whole movie. I am saddened by our society. And this sort of movie makes me lose hope in equality. Amen."

The characters are remarkably real, and believable. Usage of CG to show Ittan Momen (Flying cloth) was a nice touch.\n\nThe movie was little rough at the edges as it was the first attempt to bring Kitaro into live action movie (This improves a lot on the Millennium Curse). The story tried to tell too much. There&apos;s the Yokai kingdom with Oo Tengu as the judge, there&apos;s Kitaro&apos;s friends Neko Musume, Konaki Jiji, Sunakake Babaa, Nurikabe, and Ittan Momen, and then there&apos;s love story between Kitaro and the girl. Things got little bit confusing, and the characters didn&apos;t get enough time of the day on each of their parts.\n\nBut the movie was fun to watch, and entertaining. I really liked the rendition of Kitaro in this movie. It could have been a real cheese, but it wasn&apos;t. The movie is recommended as is its sequel. A nice Yokai movie from Japan.",

It was 1964, and for that time, I thought it was done pretty well, if you look at the themes the movie was trying to portray. Sure it was full of cheesy effects, but the premise was pretty good. Filmaking had at least progressed from the &apos;50&apos;s Cold War hysteria to the 60&apos;s trying to understand one another (somewhat). Some people need to stop trying to be witty and hope they get to be the next Roger Ebert, and be be honest about a movie. I have great memories of seeing this movie in the 1960&apos;s at a theater, and I have a copy I obtained on the Internet simply because of the fun such sci-fi was and continues to be for fans of the genre. Without such movies, you would not have the Star Wars franchise!!! Think about the history of the genre, and not how clever you are!"

      "reviewBody": "A literal translation of the French title would be Unusual America and this seems to more appropriately hint at the mondo movie precursor we have here. I&apos;m not sure about the director&apos;s many other documentaries but here there is no attempt to engage with anyone, this is simple a series of visuals, unusual and not so unusual. There are some fantastic looking visuals and all in those wondrous 1950s Technicolor tints. There are far too many ice-creams and hot-dogs, processions and competitions but plenty of glorious hoardings and roadside diners too. There is mention of Chris Marker and Jean Cocteau with regard to he commentary but I feel their input must have been minimal because this really lets the piece down. Here is a pompous Frenchman pointing out US silliness and spouting faux psychological insights whilst capturing really quite fine moments in amongst the dross. Well worth seeing but maybe next time I&apos;ll watch without that rubbish commentary.",

It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making.\n\nThis guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don&apos;t believe that.\n\nThe City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. \n\nSo it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick.\n\nWish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Music of passion&quot; is a biopic about (the last thirty years) of the life of the Russian classical composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe film is told in series of more or less independent episodes. Maybe for every Russian the story of the life of Tchaikovsky is well known, but for Western eyes this way of telling the story is a little confusing.\n\nIt is generally believed that Tchaikovsky was a homosexual, but in the Russia of 1970 it was still difficult to be frank about this fact (as it still is in the Russia of 2021 I think). More surprising to me was the fact that in Russia Tschaikovsky is mainly seen as a composer of opera&apos;s and not so much of symphonies. The opera&apos;s of &quot;Jevgeni Onjegin&quot; and &quot;Queen of spades&quot; play an important role in the film.\n\nAs may be expected in a biopic about a composer the music is very beautiful. The cinematography is also OK, especially in the scene with the coach riding through a birch forest (the symbol of Russia&apos;s vastness). There is however nothing more kindly to report about this film. The acting is rigid and the dialogue is bombastic.\n\nAll in all &quot;Music of passion&quot; is no match for other biopics about composers such as &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984, Milos Forman, about Mozart) or &quot;Immortal beloved&quot; (1994, Bernard Rose, about Beethoven). I saw &quot;Music for passion&quot; in a program with three films from Russia in the movie house of the city where I live. With directors such as Sergei Eisenstein, Mikhail Kalatozov and Andrei Tarkovsky I I really wondered if &quot;Music of passion&quot; was the right choice for this program.",

Most of the film centers on Mario&apos;s continuous casual but very passionate conquests of the fair sex and he is mostly responsible for the film&apos;s erotic scenes as he trails Emanuelle to blackmail her. A couple of these scenes are with a woman he met on the plane to Cyprus and they&apos;re both erotic and humorous: as soon as she puts some eggs in the frying pan or some fresh coffee on to boil when he arrives, he inevitably &quot;has at her.&quot; The eggs heat up and explode, or the coffee boils over and splatters, a perfect accompaniment to their hot, passionate sex bouts. Mario is actually pretty cool in demeanor until his vicious side comes out...and his brutal, graphic rape of the spoiled pubescent stepdaughter destroys any feelings of approval one might have formed for him. Emannuelle in this film is just as immoral and coldblooded, mean and vicious.The abrupt ending only hints at her ambitions coming to an end when her part as instigator in the murder plot is revealed. Worth watching for Tryfonas&apos; performance which is the only element in this that hold one&apos;s interest. With his memorable portrayal of the sinister but sexy lady-killer with the fresh daily rose in his teeth, Tryfonas alone raises it to a 7. Without him there would be no film at all, and it would rate barely a 3.",

      "reviewBody": "»The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance« (1962) wins a top spot among my favourite classic westerns. The first shots of the film take us to Shinbone, a border town in an unnamed Western state, and the arrival of Senator Rans Stoddard and his wife Hallie. The funeral of local small rancher Tom Doniphon brings them, after many years, back to the town where the senator began his career, becoming known as &quot;the man&quot; from the title line. In an interview with a young reporter and editor-in-chief of a local newspaper covering this occasion, hence in the accompanying retrospective, he tells a never-before-told story: the real truth about the early trigger of his sudden local popularity and the consequent lightning-fast rise on the political ladder... Avoiding the main spoiler, let it be only known that subsequent to hearing that far unknown, history changing facts, the editor-in-chief, to Ranse&apos;s surprise, theatrically tore up his reporter&apos;s notes, giving the following explanation, &quot;when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&quot; Thus uncompromising, legend goes on and, in the last scene on the train, thankful for the railroad&apos;s courtesies Ranse continues to be honoured with the answer that will force him to swallow lumps in his throat for the rest of his days and beyond, &quot;Nothing&apos;s too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!&quot;\n\nWhat is most interesting is that it was exactly Ford who has, in his rich oeuvre, often (but by no means exclusively) directed Westerns (or as he liked to introduce himself: &quot;My name is John Ford and I make Westerns .&quot;) and built many of these myths and legends, but here, towards the end of his directorial career, he relativizes them.\n\nUnfortunately, in the present world filled with overdependence on technology (that makes us conformists), intolerance to the hardships and inconveniences of nature, reduction of warm feelings and empathy as well as increased insensitivity among people... especially newer generations are becoming less exposed to the good stuff of the past, including John Ford&apos;s movies. Ford knew how to choose a perfect scenario or bring a less perfect one to perfection, and, although himself somewhat withdrawn and distanced, infused such a scenario with emotions and sentiment. Often he filled them with humour and the joy of life, but also wisdom and humanism, making them deeply woven into what a man actually is and thus engraved in the minds of generations of movie goers. Nowadays, somehow we have all forgotten the importance of such films that go beyond their simple purpose of being just a forgettable pastime, and the film &quot;The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance&quot; is exactly such a film that, seasoned with Ford&apos;s beautiful aesthetics, has an added value in itself and then for the culture and civilization which produced it.\n\nNot even a decade after the golden age of Hollywood films, Ford warns of the danger that politics destroys the beauty in people, it erases the legend, while, in fact, the legend and the storytelling are more important to people than a purely political narrative. Here, and especially here, for the umpteenth time we experience the phenomenon of the western, the miracle of that once most popular genre, which does not reflect our lives in any obvious way (neither in the manner or content, nor in the location or scenography), and yet, though hard to believe, it appears as if in itself it keeps some kind of a core to each one of them (our lives). Furthermore, the action in the film is so universal that despite the fact that it is a complete fabrication, not based on a real place and events, it seems as if we are watching a documentary presentation of historical events. And whenever a film portrays a historically important time, whether real or imaginable, it is very interesting to experience that cinematic meta-moment prophetically dedicated to events that will only happen, once or repeatedly, thus reversing sentimentality for the past, a nostalgia, and advancing it to the predictable future. Included here are depictions of a free press, town meetings, territorial conventions and statehood debates, subjecting politics to interest lobbies and corruption, violence in elections... foreseeing their future recurrences and anticipating nostalgia for them.\n\nThe acting contributions are very worth mentioning. Despite his shorter screen time, thanks to his usual commanding presence John Wayne skilfully brings about the pivotal role of Tom Doniphon, while both main opponents show versatility of their onscreen persona at times of temptation: Lee Marvin as infamous outlaw, tough and mean Liberty Valance, shows weakness when, subsequent to his failed attempt to get nominated for the regional delegate to the upcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital, he resorts to excessive vandalism and then drowns his frustration in alcohol, while James Stewart as Ransom &quot;Ranse&quot; Stoddard, at first, after Valance bullies him in the restaurant, begins practicing with an old gun, and then responds to Valance&apos;s gunfight challenge when his attempts to bring Valance to justice through the law fail. Outstanding in supporting roles are Vera Miles (who, sadly, missed an earlier opportunity to join Jimmy Stewart in another magnum opus, Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Vertigo,&quot; due to her real-life pregnancy at the time) as the not-meant-to-be Tom&apos;s, eventually Ranse&apos;s wife Hallie Stoddard, Edmond O&apos;Brien as Dutton Peabody, founder, owner, editor of the local free press (the Shinbone Star), uncompromising &quot;old servant of the public weal&quot;, waiting for his &quot;shining hour&quot; ... yet to come,&quot; who, also, &quot;sweeps out the place&quot;, Woody Strode as Pompey, Tom Doniphon&apos;s hired hand, John Carradine as Maj. Cassius Starbuckle, speaker on behalf of the cattle barons at the territorial convention, Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef as Floyd and Reese, Valance&apos;s myrmidons, Andy Devine as the fearful Sheriff Link Appleyard, looking only for the ways not to have beef with the criminals but rather a free beef on his plate, and some more, all benefiting from Ford&apos;s unique way of handling actors, bringing out the best in them, as many acknowledged subsequently.",

      "reviewBody": "Rumpelstiltskin is based on story by the Grimm brothers, and it has been filmed few times before, including once starring the great midget himself Billy Barty as Rumpelstiltskin.  However this version seems to be just a cheap Leprechaun rip off, you can easily imagine the baby chasing Rumpelstiltskin replaced by Warvick Davis chasing a pot of gold.\n\n I cant say I watched this movie from beginning to end with great interest, in fact I missed the other half almost completely. So there is a change that during the second half there was some big and unique plot revelation that makes this movie rise to a classic level, but I think not.   Overally Rumpelstiltskin is just your typical cheap D-grade horrorflick which is made with little or no talent or enthusiasm.  \n\nThe actors are lifeless, including the guy playing the villain Rumpelstiltskin, Max Grodénchik. This is a shame because a good villain can save a lot in these kinds of movies.  Too bad Grodenchik lacks the personality to make the character work.  Kevin Yaghers Rumpelstiltskin make up is pretty uninspired too.  \n\nOverally.. this is a very bad and cheaply done horror film with lousy acting.  3/10 is pretty rightful rating for it. Some of you bad horror film fans might like it, but I suggest not to invest money in it."

It almost seems like they were aiming it at a younger audience than their content is normally directed at.\n\nThere is also a terrible scene involving an alien toilet that I&apos;ve very surprised made the final cut.\n\nOn a positive note, the shiny parts like special effects were actually pretty good.\n\n I&apos;ve watched Rooster Teeth content for 15 years, and I will continue to do so, but this might be the worst thing they have ever made.",

The story is a great idea, but it falls flat in some places. It seems to be a function partly of writing and partly of editing - there are some scenes that don&apos;t quite connect to the rest of the story, and others where one wonders simply &quot;Why?&quot; Despite these downfalls, there is some wit to the script, and this is definitely not a waste of time for anyone who likes the gritty cop dramas or even just film noir. The rap stars have small roles as bad guys, but it really works well - it was a great job of crossover for the musicians. Overall, not a bad flick for something that went straight to video!",

The Nazis wants to use Toulon&apos;s secrets to create an army of the undead, and that&apos;s when the fun begins. Toulon sics his killer puppets on the Nazis, to spectacularly bloody effect. The puppets are the good guys in this one. What also makes a huge difference here is the introduction of Guy &quot;Mr. Sardonicus&quot; Rolfe as Toulon, a role he would essay in two more sequels. Rolfe is a great Toulon, a charismatic and even sympathetic character who loves his deadly puppets as only a papa creator could. Rolfe lent an air of integrity and distinction to the series. Part 3 is a great little B-horror addition to the series that was shot on the Universal back lot instead of Europe to surprisingly solid effect. A must-see.",

      "reviewBody": "THE SUN ALSO RISES was 20th Century Fox&apos;s big-budget &apos;prestige&apos; film for 1957, based on one of Hemingway&apos;s best-known novels, shot on location in Paris and Mexico (substituting for Spain), and starring the studio&apos;s long-reigning superstar, Tyrone Power, surrounded by some of the screen&apos;s most legendary actors (Ava Gardner, Errol Flynn, Mel Ferrer, and Eddie Albert). With all the talent assembled in front of and behind the camera, producer Darryl F. Zanuck felt confident that the film would be an enduring classic for both his own independent company, and his studio.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t, unfortunately...\n\nThe problem with the film was a fundamental one; the &apos;Lost Generation&apos; Hemingway wrote of were disillusioned young Americans, who, shattered by the horror and brutality of a meaningless &apos;Great War&apos;, lost their innocence, and became a &apos;live fast, die young&apos; crowd of expatriates, settling in Paris. These were men and women in their twenties and thirties...yet the actors chosen to portray them were all ten to twenty years older! The most glaring example of this can be seen in the film&apos;s star, Tyrone Power. As newspaperman Jake Barnes, a vet whose war injuries render him impotent, unable to satisfy the woman he loves (Ava Gardner), and, therefore, the &apos;perfect&apos; observer of his love&apos;s romantic entanglements with other men, Power seems more a victim of a midlife crisis than a young man devastated about losing his manhood. In his next-to-last film, Power, at 44, was aging badly, his hair thinning and his slender, &apos;movie idol&apos; good looks surrendering to a middle-aged paunch. Only when he smiles do the years seem to lift, a bit, and a ghost of the &quot;too handsome to be true&quot; younger man appears. Adding to his physical deterioration was an undiagnosed heart condition, which would kill him, in less than two years.\n\nHis co-star, Ava Gardner, at 35, was going through a decline, as well, but, as with her character, Lady Brett Ashley, her vices were the cause of her self-destruction. Both Brett and Ava were hedonistic women too fond of booze, bullfighters, and nightlife, and in Ava&apos;s case, once-classic features were beginning to develop bags and wrinkles that makeup and lighting couldn&apos;t hide. Seeing Power, Mel Ferrer, Flynn, and young future film mogul Robert Evans (as a bullfighter), all lusting after her can lead a viewer to wonder if the War had impaired everyone&apos;s eyesight, as well as their judgment!\n\nComing off best are Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert. Flynn, at 48, long past his &apos;glamorous&apos; prime (he and Power had been Hollywood&apos;s best-looking &apos;swashbucklers&apos; of the early 40s), had become a very credible character actor, usually portraying variations of himself. His &apos;Mike Campbell&apos;, an alcoholic who is impoverished but still clinging to his pride, was, sadly, a dead-on assessment of Errol Flynn, as well. Like Power, he would be dead in two years, a victim of his own excesses. On the other hand, Eddie Albert, at 49, had long been health-conscious, and his performance as a drunk was simply good acting; paired with Flynn, they &apos;steal&apos; the film, particularly during the famous Pamplona bull run, when the duo flee for their lives (while guzzling wine), and Flynn attempts to use a bad check as a cape to &apos;fight&apos; a bull!\n\nThe drama seems overdrawn, the romance lacks &apos;fire&apos;, and the resolution is a hollow one. Even with the pretty scenery, Hugo Friedhofer&apos;s soaring film score, and Henry King&apos;s skill as a director, THE SUN ALSO RISES fails to generate more than a curiosity value, at the sight of so many actors, past their prime, trying to seem youthful and dynamic.\n\nThe studio just released the film on DVD; seeing photos of Power, Flynn, and Gardner between takes, and hearing director Henry King&apos;s audio reminiscences of the production are possibly more entertaining than the feature, itself!",

There are lots of what could be euphemistically described as vibrant colours on screen at any given time. The plot, such as it is, revolves around love found, love lost and love re-found. All clocking in at little under three hours, with the characters bursting into song at the slightest provocation. Some of the choreography for the song and dance sequences must have taken ages to put together. As usual in Indian films, kissing is taboo and the romantic sequences are remarkably chaste by western standards. All the actors should have life memberships of the academy of over-acting. Emotional nuance is not really the name of the game here. But the actors sure are good looking, even those with grandchildren. They seem to have discovered the fountain of youth. While all of this doesn&apos;t sound like a glowing review, points have to be granted for the sheer positive life-force of this film and its life affirming message.",

      "reviewBody": "You know a movie is gonna be bad when it warns that the events depicted in this fictional movie are fictional, but that&apos;s the least of the problems with the over-budget, over-directed, and overly long wet blanket war epic Inchon. The movie takes place during the Communist overthrow in Korea and the Battle of Inchon in 1950. It also throws in stories involving Barbara (Jacqueline Bassett) driving through South Korea with orphan children to meet her ex-husband Lt. Hallsworth (Ben Gazzara) and Douglas MacArthur (Laurence Olivier) setting up plans for battle and raiding a lighthouse to signal the battleships. I guess Terence Young was trying to channel David Lean with a giant cast of extras in grand sets and landscapes, but in Inchon, the story and subplots connect so little it feels more like a pilot for a 1950&apos;s TV show than a movie. However, the cornball melodrama, overabundance on pyrotechnic effects, and horrendous writing makes it more on par with the material for B-movies. More problems: the Korean invasion scenes tie very little to what&apos;s going on in the story, the battle sequences seem randomly scattered for no coherent reason, every extra overacts when blown up, and the love story is meaningless. Worst of all, when MacArthur showed up thirty minutes in, the movie seemed to jump ship on one story and steer focus to another, almost as if the screenwriter forgot who the main characters were and wanted to mimic Patton. Well to my knowledge, Laurence Olivier is no George C. Scott and Robin Moore and Laird Koenig are no Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, either. To compare Inchon to Michael Bay&apos;s Pearl Harbor would be an extraordinary insult, as Mr. Bay has more respect for explosions and knows how to keep his schlocky storylines consistently. Inchon, on the other hand, is a complete messy disaster from start to finish. (1 Corn Cob Pipe out of 5)",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s very popular to &quot;hate&quot; the nowadays trend of horror movie remakes, but you always have to bear two things in mind. 1) If we would collectively stop watching them, Hollywood wouldn&apos;t make them anymore and 2) there exist some remakes that are truly worth watching even though they still can&apos;t hold a candle to the original. Steven R. Monroe&apos;s update of the one of the most notorious cult movies ever made is such a remake. Meir Zarchi&apos;s original is a bona fide cult monument. You either love or hate it, but you can&apos;t deny it&apos;s a powerfully shocking and unforgettable film. The remake is perhaps not as memorable, but it definitely does contain a few sequences that are extremely brutal and hard to digest. Especially in comparison to the remake of that other notorious 70&apos;s classic – &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, which is rather soft and intended for wider audiences – this film is exclusively meant for experienced horror fanatics with a strong stomach and nerves of steel. The plot is commonly known, I presume. Jennifer, a young writer in search of inspiration for her second novel, withdraws herself to a remote cabin in the Louisianan backwoods area. Upon her arrival, she immediately draws the attention of the local &quot;tough&quot; guys working at the gas station as well as from the mentally handicapped handyman Matthew. Few days later, Jennifer gets humiliated and brutally gang-raped by the four men and even a local authority figure. What follows is her hardcore-to-the-bone vengeance, clearly executed with a deep hatred and zero morality whatsoever. The &quot;I spit on your Grave&quot; remake blends the raw atmosphere of the original with the more modern horror trend of torture-porn. The revenge that Sarah has prepared for her assailants are carefully planned and imaginative death traps to assure a maximum of agony. Some of the death sequences, like for example the acid bathtub or the eye-picking, would even make the Jigsaw killer of &quot;Saw&quot; jealous. Sarah Butler makes a strong impression in her role as not-so-vulnerable young girl and it&apos;s definitely a courageous performance. I hope she&apos;ll still find other roles without forever being known as the &quot;I Spit on your Grave&quot; girl. The rapists, on the other hand, are not as repulsive as they ought to be. Their performances aren&apos;t too memorable either, with the exception of Andrew Howard as the rotten sheriff. His whole character is a nice addition to Zarchi&apos;s original script, as a matter of fact.",

      "reviewBody": "Srt in 1797 Utah, an aged Cheyenne (Trevor Howard) patriarch helps his kin to fight off a raiding party of rival Crow warriors and while he tells his grandchildren the story of their family. Along the way hee must risk his own life by passing a hard proof . Narrated by a voice-over , Smiling Wolf (Nick Ramus) , telling the perilous life of the starring Windwalker from his youthful (James Remar) falling in love for Tashina (Serene Hedine) and while suffering several dangers from a raiding party of enemy Indians . He conquered love and death...now he walks the winds of eternity!\n\nSimple and plain Western with breathtaking outdoors filmed in naturals parks , being an independent project filmed in the Crow and Cheyennes Indian languages and subtitled in English throughout . An unique tale of &apos;Indians without a single cowboy&apos; with great cinematography , splendid landscapes and rousing musical score . Including fantastic inspiration in the Native habits , showing spiritual apparitions and weird dreams, as well as the spectacular outdoors fom Diamond Fork Canyon, Utah, Smith &amp; Moorehouse Reservoir, Uinta Mountains, Utah, Uinta Mountains, and interior shots on sound stage : Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. Stars the classic actor Trevor Howard who gives a nice acting playing an ancient Indian warrior who has reached the end of his life is brought back from his &apos;death&apos; to save his family , as he&apos;s the only cast member who isn&apos;t a Native American . Being well accompanied by a decent cast, such as : James Remar , Nick Ramus , Serene Hedin , Rudy Diaz and brief appearance by Billy Drago.\n\nHere stands out the gorgeous cinematography , though being really necessary a perfect remastering because of the film copy is washed-up. Nicely financed by Arthur R Dubbs , an expert producer of nature films such as : Robinson Family , Across the Great Divide , The Mountain of the Robinson Family , Wilderness , Wonder of It All , American Wilderness . The motion picture was well directed by Kieth Merril . He is a good professional , a nice director and producer, known for The Great American Cowboy (1974), Amazon (1997) and 12 Dogs of Christmas: Great Puppy Rescue (2012) , among others . Rating : 6.5/10. The flick will appeal to Indian Westerns enthusiasts . Well worth watching .",

I was left with an unknown women who had come to watch the next showing. (Something unheard of in this day!) The sheer joy of the singing, dancing and innocence of a time past is something that is sorely missed today.\n\nDoris Day&apos;s Calamity Jane is a story of love between men and women and women and women during a time when this love was innocent and people did not worry that someone might look at it in a sexual way. Women could hold hands and hug to support each other in happiness as well as grief.\n\nSongs like &apos;Secret Love&apos; and &apos;Take Me Back to the Black Hills&apos; are beautiful even to the audiences today. this type of music will never die."

It&apos;s far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying &quot;that was a stupid movie&quot;. (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the &apos;upsides&apos;: This movie certainly had it&apos;s &apos;wow&apos; moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you&apos;ve played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven&apos;t played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.",

This film is quite like a reunion for the cast of the original &quot;Tremors&quot;. Michael Gross returns for the role of Burt Gummer, and so does some of the original cast including Ariana Richards, Tony Genero, Robert Jayne and Charlotte Stewart as the townies of Perfection, which has become famous all over the world as habitat of the giant graboids. But their re-appearance in the town isn&apos;t all attraction, when they begin to change again.\n\nAlthough not as excellent, &quot;Tremors 3&quot; emerges as a funny, skin-crawling sequel. The comedy is fine, and the action is fast. But the special-effects aren&apos;t of much realism. The creatures look just like a couple of cartoons on a real background.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s not one of those bad sequels, &quot;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&quot; is still fun, even for the young viewers.\n\nTV movie rating: *** out of 5.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll start with the positive: The animation, the colors, everything was beautiful. So if you wanted to just look at pretty things for a good hour and a half, you could project this film and mute it and enjoy.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we are lost in terms of what&apos;s going on, which is fine, as long as at some point you start understanding something. The film never develops a plot, a tangible story. The &quot;legend&quot; that all the characters in the ancient world speak of is never explained or revealed. How and why the two worlds collide is never explained. Things happen. We do not understand why, though we are constantly watching some characters saying &quot;Oh, this is what the legend predicted.&quot; &quot;This, for sure, will mean this, oh, but it could go either way, the legend is unclear.&quot; On and on, this legend is talked about but never revealed. If at the end of the film you try to understand what the legend could have been, you still have no clue... Characters are flat, as their lives, their conflicts are not explained either. At some point, the general does something, which is baffling, as we do not know why he would do this. This seems to be turning point in the story, though, again, it is not explained nor is it resolved, really, in the end.\n\nSo great visuals, but very poor plot, if you can even call it that. At times I was wondered if something got lost in translation... Perhaps someone who understands the original language can shed some light.\n\nNote: Also not for little children, as there are some very scary and dark moments, especially towards the end, but kids might also find the bit about the dog at the beginning upsetting.",

      "reviewBody": "The other night my cousins and I were watching some TV after midnight and we catch up the last 20 minutes of &quot;Big Fish&quot; and after that film &quot;Tomcats&quot; began. It was very late but the credits sequence was cool so we stay and the first beat in the film was really funny so we end up watching it until the end. That beat was between 4 or 5 friends and consist in never get married; they created a bank account so every day that passes, more money for the winner. Eventually everybody get married, except Michael and Kyle, and now the prize for the winner is $500,000. The story suddenly makes that Michael needs the money by the end of the week so he makes a plan and blah blah. After that we just forget about the beat and is all a love story, quite predictable by the way, and even the main character ends in a point when even he won the money, he doesn&apos;t care because of the love. But in that entire decent love story there are many funny moments especially for the sexual maniac that is Kyle and for Michael&apos;s bad experiences with women, even if they look like a pretty innocent girl or if they are the grandma of the innocent girl Eventually we have a really enjoyable time with this film without expecting something. So I think this film is the kind that if you have the chance to watch it just for coincidence in TV it will be a good way to have 90 minutes of pure entertainment."

He&apos;s already risked time in the federal penitentiary for bank robbery so he wants his money. \n\nThe Boy Who Caught A Crook is a nice, but below average kid&apos;s film with a few too many holes in the story to be terribly convincing to anyone over 14. Wanda Hendrix turns in a nice performance as well as Mobley&apos;s widowed mother. In fact the whole cast is decent and sincere, but the film just doesn&apos;t rise above mediocrity.\n\nAnd I guess the title itself gives it all away.",

      "reviewBody": "I like &apos;loser meets beauty&apos; stories, and I also like most of Tommy Jaud&apos;s books. They often revolve around some kind of looser who finally overcomes his awkwardness after his gf broke up. While the main characters in the books are usually relatable (often because of the many references to pop culture and real events), and you want them to get better and succeed, in the movie this role is played by Oliver Pocher but in such a stubborn and even hateful way that I just wished him the worst.\n\nIn the books the social failures of the main character usually happen because he doesn&apos;t know better, or out of some slapstick situation, but in the movie the main character is simply very unsympathetic, rude and simply put not a good friend. It&apos;s not the poor nerd who falls in love with an unreachable women, it&apos;s a rude stalker who just finds some new victim.\n\nMost other characters don&apos;t seem to notice what an unsocial person he is. Even stuff that could be deemed cute and funny in the book turn angry and spiteful in Pochers interpretation.\n\nPocher probably was used for this movie due to his (then) rising popularity, and if this performance ever worked, it has aged terrible.",

      "reviewBody": "Umrao Jaan(1981) is based on the novel - &apos;Umrao Jaan Ada&apos; of Mirza Mohammad Haadi Ruswa. I happened to watch the movie first and read the novel later. And undoubtedly, director Muzaffar Ali&apos;s cinematic version of the story originally written in the nineteenth century and said to be the true story of a true character, is better than the written work.\n\nThe story belongs to the Tawaayaf(courtesan) Umrao Jaan who was born at Faizabaad as Ameeran. After getting kidnapped and sold to a Kotha(brothel) in Lucknow, she grows up and becomes famous among the rich and the elite because of her Shaayari(Urdu poetry) sung in her melodious voice and coupled with her enchanting dances. However she finds almost everybody around him as greedy for her earnings and she continue to move through her journey of life with a sense of complete loneliness within her. Certain males enter her life and raise false hopes in her heart for being able to live a normal married life containing a loving husband, social acceptance and motherhood but finally, she finds that loneliness only is her destiny.\n\nTaking the story from the said novel, producer-director Muzaffar Ali himself has written the screenplay and dialogs of this movie in association with Shama Zaidi and Jaaved Siddiqui. This script has been written quite crisply without giving undue footage to anything and not allowing the focus to divert from the principal character and her woes. The narrative with the gloom and loneliness of the principal character prevalent in every moment of it, moves at a reasonable pace without allowing any laxity or boredom to creep in. The audience is not only kept engaged in the narrative and glued to the screen for more than two hours but also made to feel the pain, the feelings and the stuffiness of the pivotal character. It is a very impressive movie, no doubt.\n\nThe ending scene is just superb in which Umrao Jaan wipes the mirror to see her face in that. It&apos;s an example of sheer brilliance on the part of the filmmaker who conveys the permanent sense of loneliness in the courtesan to the audience leaving the theatre without any spoon-feeding. Anybody who has watched this movie on the big screen must have left the theatre with a throbbing in his / her heart.\n\nUmrao Jaan can be termed as pain-filled poetry written on celluloid. It stirs, moves, pinches and brings tears to eyes. It&apos;s a journey made by the spectator alongwith the courtesan known as Umrao Jaan. Within a few minutes, the narrative envelops the viewer and makes him a part of the unusual story of the protagonist being told to him.\n\nThe art director has brought the period of the 19th century alive on the screen. The complete milieu including the architecture, the dialect, the clothes, the style of living etc. are authentic. The cinematographer has also left no stone unturned from his side in this regard and thus a realistic account of that era is presented to the audience who also happen to witness the turbulence due to the Gadar or the mutiny of 1857 by a section of the Indians against the British rule.\n\nRekha quite deservingly won the national award for the best actress for the title role played by her in this movie(though Jennifer Kendal Kapoor was a stronger contender for that award for that year for her performance in 36 Chowringhee Lane). Rekha does not seem to be acting, she appears to be actually living the life of Umrao Jaan. Originally a Tamilian, this talented actress has portrayed the Urdu speaking Shaayara cum Tawaayaf in an amazing manner.\n\nFarooque Sheikh as Umrao Jaan&apos;s lover and all the other characters have also done exceedingly well. Even the small characters of Maulvi Saheb(Gajaanan Jaagirdaar) and Bismillah(Prema Naarayan) are able to leave their imprint in the movie. The romance between Farooque and Rekha is so delicate that the audience can&apos;t help falling in love with them and their relationship.\n\nKhayyam has composed immortal music with the great Shaayari of Shaharyaar for this movie. All the ghazals and nazms are so touching that any lover of music and Shaayari can keep on listening to them again and again. Dil Cheez Kya Hai Aap Meri Jaan Leejiye, In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke Mastaane Hazaaron Hain, Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamen, Justujoo Jiski Thi Usko To Na Paaya Humne etc. are heart-conquerors. Most of these are gems in the voice of Asha Bhosle whereas Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamen is a memorable ghazal of Talat Aziz. The album contains a couple of folk songs also and a classic written by Amir Khusro. However the pain-soaked ghazal (which is placed at the end of the movie) which always brings a flood of tears in my eyes is - Ye Kya Jagah Hai Doston, Ye Kaun Sa Dayaar Hai, Hadd-e-Nigaah Tak Jahaan Gubaar Hi Gubaar Hai.\n\nUmrao Jaan is a true classic. A masterpiece. It was remade by J.P. Dutta in 2006 by taking Aishwarya Rai in the title role. Though I found J.P. Dutta&apos;s movie as closer to the novel of Mirza Haadi Ruswa, it lacked the soul of the story. If anybody wants to meet the real Umrao Jaan that used to exist some 150 years ago, then this movie only is the perfect choice for him / her.",

This is not at all what I was expecting, which was something along the lines of &quot;OUR space program is better than YOUR space program&quot;, considering the year this was made.  However, there was only one passing reference to any political/ideological struggle, and that was probably thrown in to appease whatever Soviet film board that had to give its approval to this movie.  I would recommend this one for any sci-fi junkies out there who like to see what other countries did with the genre."

I saw this coming a mile away, but it was still good when it happened.\n\nEven if the journey was predictable, it was enjoyable to see the seamy side of Budapest, and to visit a club where the main attraction is lots of full frontal nudity. The film features some ménage à trois, girl-on-girl, and regular sex with more boobies than you can count. Forget the story and just enjoy the soft porn.",

It was weird. I also feel if it had been more dialogue based we could have got a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles but understood the relationship of Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (mostly spoken in Spanish) than I did of Doug and Vicky which just seemed to lack a huge amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature Vicky and Doug&apos;s relationship.\n\nAnyway well acted but yeah the narrator ruins it. Javier Bardem is amazing as usual.",

The kind of stuff nobody would like to watch on the big screen..\n\n\n* the &quot;actors&quot; are acting .. very bad! Think about the worst performance you have ever seen - and than imagine all the bad actors being drunk, insane, spastic and disabled in many other ways.. Than multiply the resulting &quot;badness&quot; with the number of sand grains laying in the sahara desert and you&apos;ve got an idea of what &quot;Daniel der Zauberer&quot; is like! The only reason why this movie has left the very justified last place of this Movie Database is because the voting was falsified by organized hordes of &quot;Daniel Fans&quot;, it really IS the worst movie ever made..\n",

      "reviewBody": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been a worldwide phenomenon for a while now. In book form, the original film, and the Hollywood remake. It is a disturbing, yet riveting tale, as is the story behind the author who made it. While Fincher&apos;s version is visually and stylistically more striking, I feel this original Swedish film does a better job bringing the disturbing mystery to the silver screen. Structured much more fluidly than the Hollywood version, the mystery of a missing girl flows and develops slowly, dishing out red herrings and suspense with each turn (something lacking in the Fincher version). It also stays closer to the original title of the book (and theme) Men who Hate Women. In the end, this is a dark tale of what rape does to women and to the world. Not everyone&apos;s idea of &apos;entertainment,&apos; but a thought-provoking mystery for those with strong stomachs.",

Laurent Lucas, who came as Daniel to remind us of many important villains, also performed well.\n\nEmily, the ten-year-old daughter of Police Inspector Richard Malinowski, is brutally murdered. Since the victim was the daughter of a police officer, his colleagues attached great importance to finding the culprit immediately.\n\nDefendant Daniel Ekman is in prison. But then he keeps writing letters to Richard saying that he was not the one who did that cruel thing.\n\nThe film tells the story of Richard&apos;s parallel investigation to find out if Daniel is the real culprit and to find out who caused his Emily&apos;s death.\n\nMany of the films that have stories about the murders of loved ones and their endings end in the same direction as revenge. The success of such films often depends on how much revenge the audience can contain.\n\nI found this film to be a good fit. An unexpected climax enjoyed well.",

      "reviewBody": "Another stellar performance by the one and only Shima Iwashita, who plays Chieko. The movie tells the story of two artists who fall in love and marry. I was moved by how supportive and non-traditional the husband was considering the conventional constrictions of marriage in Japan at the time. We watch them grow as artists and as a married couple. Even more touching was the husband&apos;s devotion to Chieko during a crisis in their lives. Some of the films most memorable scenes are about the complexities of dealing with someone you love dealing with circumstances beyond anyone&apos;s control. Might be tempting to categorize it as a &quot;chick flick,&quot; but because it is based on a true story, and because it is so sensitively done and beautifully filmed it transcends sentimentality. The way the director joined art and music in this film is especially lovely. The actor who plays Chieko&apos;s husband gives an excellent performance. I definitely recommend this film."

The way the story is told is great, and you really get involved with the film. And it is very funny as well! I emmidiately felt the urge to go see the magnificent landscapes in the film, and maybe i will some day. I loved the actors in it, Björn Kellman is always wonderful to watch, but the younger actors were great too. I liked Andreas af Enehjelm (Niila) in particular, he seems to be a very sensitive actor. Let&apos;s have more Finnish and Swedish films, the languages are beautiful and the stories go straight to the heart!",

      "name": "Superb Spanish giallo about an ex-convict and three unstable sisters",
      "reviewBody": "Based upon a real life story that I&apos;m not going to share here, in order to avoid obvious spoilers, &quot;Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll&quot; is perhaps one of the most unreasonably overlooked giallos ever made. I know this term is essentially meant to classify certain Italian horror and mystery movies, but whoever thinks other countries cannot produce decent giallos that can be equally entertaining and highly appreciated, is wrong. &quot;Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll&quot;, is perhaps one of the best examples to demonstrate this, without actually emulating some of the most distinguished giallos that were released back then. As a matter of fact, it seems that director Carlos Aured, was clever enough to avoid the cliché of putting the name of an animal on the title. Many other directors were inclined to do so, during the giallo profusion that took place during the 1970s. No big deal, after all, but I just thought it would be fair to comment on this little detail as well.\n\nIn &quot;Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll&quot;, an ex-convict named Gilles, tries to start a new life by taking refuge in a small town of the French border. Regardless of the people&apos;s aloofness, he stays around to find a job in this new place. Claude, on the other hand, is a beautiful woman with an orthopedic hand, who lives in a big gloomy house in the outskirts with her two eccentric sisters, Yvette and Nicole. Gilles starts working at Claude&apos;s house as a handyman and simultaneously, a mysterious nurse called Michelle arrives to take care of Yvette, who is crippled and has to be under constant surveillance. Concurrently, young girls begin to appear brutally murdered out of the blue and the police have no clue about what is going on. All the victims share certain parallels, like, having blue eyes and light-colored hair, but it seems like there&apos;s nothing else to tie them with each other. The only thing that matches perfectly with the sudden murders is the arrival of Gilles and Michelle to the old house. Everyone gossips about the former convict, but Claude remains loyal to her secret love towards him and continues to give him shelter and a job no matter what. Unfortunately, Gilles has strange visions of himself murdering young women for no reason and struggles with himself to avoid doing something that he might regret later. As the days go by, the relationship between Gilles, Michelle and the three psychotic women becomes more and more tense each day and meanwhile, the mysterious killer keeps slaughtering beautiful girls out there.\n\nTo be honest, I was actually looking forward to something satisfying but in a less serious way. I assumed this was going to be some kind of mindless exploitation flick with lots of gore and pointless sex, lesbianism and a mildly predictable ending. Unexpectedly, I got a genuinely good product with a truly unexpected ending and a decent and yet moderate share of gore that somehow doesn&apos;t make the movie fit in the exploitation category. Not that I have anything against exploitation films. As a matter of fact, I also enjoy these films very much, but my point is that &quot;Blue Eyes of the Broken Dolls&quot;, didn&apos;t fall into this less-respected category and it ended up being a charming giallo that has nothing to envy to the Italian ones. Frankly, I still cannot believe that being a film with Paul Naschy, there&apos;s no nudity or sex whatsoever. Especially if we keep in mind that these is a movie that has four attractive female character and a lusty man with all the ladies for himself. Of course, Mr. Naschy didn&apos;t miss the opportunity to appear shirtless and showing off his body all sweaty. It&apos;s alright, a little bit of vanity doesn&apos;t hurt anyone, I suppose. So concluding, I think this film will be highly regarded by anyone who is in the mood for a nice little giallo with a twisted ending and repetitive dancy music here and there.",

      "name": "dark, existential melodrama wrapped up in a B-western, a stunning debut from one of the great mavericks",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s one of the oldest Western stories: Jesse James was a big-time outlaw, robbing banks left and right, alongside his gang, including Robert Ford. One day, upon hearing of the huge bounty (and possibility of amnesty for anyone in the gang) for Jesse&apos;s murder, Ford took it upon himself to kill him so that he could be free and clear to mary his would-be wife. But things didn&apos;t quite turn out right afterwords, and Ford was considered more-so a coward, a traitor for doing this act, and any gunslinger who could gun Ford down would then be seen as the baddest dude in the west. At least, that&apos;s the legend anyway that comes out of the main plot. But there&apos;s more to it, at least under the surface, that Samuel Fuller gets to in his take on the legend of one man&apos;s existential downfall from killing his best friend, who happened to be the most feared- and yet most admired- bank robber in America for a short while. Fuller might be asking why he was admired, when he didn&apos;t do anything that really merited praise only in hindsight. There&apos;s a sense of pure melodrama, brimming with acting that is typical for the budget, but somehow Fuller brings out the best in what might be a little limited in the character actors.\n\nJohn Ireland says a lot in the understated expressions on his face, the tense feeling of rejection from the only one he can get close to- once Jesse is out of the picture- and likewise Cynthy (Barbara Britton) is very good at doing the &apos;acting-concerned&apos; woman that is reluctant to be on Ford&apos;s sleeve. It&apos;s all the more compelling because Fuller could easily make the direction more into a black and white category, that Ford is bad like Jesse was, and Cynthy is more than in her reasoning for not wanting to marry him. But even in the pulpy world of Jesse James and Robert Ford, there is room for compromise. I liked seeing the scenes where Ford goes through the humiliating act of doing a theater re-enactment of the killing scene, but suddenly seeing in a vision the actual act he performed superimposed over the pantomime. And, immediately after, as one of the very best scenes in the film, a traveling singer who sings a song terrified in Ford&apos;s face about how much of a traitor he was for killing such a man like Jesse James.\n\nIt&apos;s a sharp script considering what Fuller would have to work with, but it&apos;s also the simplicity of his craft (it might be one of those genre films where the style is so stripped down to bare essentials with necessary close-ups, consistent medium shots, that when something &apos;stylistic&apos; happens like in the last shootout between Kelly and Ford that it is shocking), how Fuller pushes it into looking like a tale that on the surface as a conventional feature. But watch how the suddenness of violence sparks up interest in the craft, how the opening bank robbery is timed and shot with the same level- or even more- tension than your average heist thriller. Or in the actual infamous scene itself, which is preceded by Ford getting a chance beforehand when James was in the bath, and the cut-aways to the POV at the back. It&apos;s bold-faced type through a crisp full-frame lens.\n\nAnd while Fuller would still go on to make greater films, I Shot Jesse James is a fantastic prototype for a great career, where history merges with the human process of change, and how love, however a typical thing in a triangle situation, complicates even the strongest of men.",

And it plays in a weird way and goes places you wouldn&apos;t expect. While the main character might do things, you wouldn&apos;t expect him to do at first, it does all make sense (well as much sense as there can be).\n\nOf course this develops into a very strange little crazy movie, that will either leave you completely confused at the end or satisfied as can be. A movie about violence, but also about (and maybe even more) craziness. It won&apos;t give you any easy answers and the end will put quite some people off (I think that the fact, that it isn&apos;t as violent as some other genre movies, might be putting people off too).\n\nIt is a very weird movie and I can&apos;t really tell you to watch it, because it might not be your taste at all.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m surprised this film isn&apos;t more well known, at least judging from the lack of information shown here. This is the story of Christian family living in Indonesia - their daily struggles, the world they live in. Nothing stunningly dramatic happens but every scene is utterly compelling and even the smallest exchange sheds light on their situation, the characters, and the society as a whole. It has a wider political and religious context but for me the personal story is what it&apos;s all about. These are people we get to know and love. You really have to see it to understand.\n\nThe plight of Christians in Indonesia is to be always just a little on the outs - not necessarily discriminated against but just never quite part of the mainstream, sometimes not able to join in with the activities of the majority. This means the family in this film is looking at Indonesian society at a slight remove at times and this is fascinating. But they&apos;re also just poor people trying to get by and do the best for each other in difficult circumstances. They&apos;re sometimes comical, sometimes not even admirable - but they really get under your skin.\n\nThis seems like a wonderful old-fashioned observational style documentary - and it is, but it&apos;s also just as much an essay film, juxtaposing ideas and images in sophisticated ways to build up a picture, a stream of ideas. It&apos;s bold, and not afraid of using technique, and some people will call this &apos;showy&apos; - I call it brave and entertaining. Visually, this is a fascinating film, full of clever shots and strange angles - all of which allows you to see reality, and the reality of the characters&apos; lives, in a new way.",

The segments of the Vapor traveling about the city and telling of his experiences are a high point of the movie, and explain what it would feel like to actually be a cloud of gas. The central story, of the attraction between the Vapor and the dancer, is well written and effectively developed on screen. This is an example of a Japanese science fiction film that often gets overshadowed by the likes of Godzilla and Rodan, but is quite good on its own merits. Watch it if you get the chance!",

At the end of hid life he was murdered by agents of the Habsburg family, as at this time Hungary was part of the Habsburg empire. At the time of filming the production was strongly supported by the Hungarian government, therefore crictics came in big waves from the opposition.

Tony Leblanc is the protagonist and plays a usual role, so do the others, like Jose Luis Lopez Vázquez (who is great) or Rafael Alonso. The thing that makes this movie different from others is that the screenplay an the improvisations of the actors are really good and funny. But there is a problem, the kind of humor they are using is a typical Spanish or Mediterranean type that could be compared with Italian humor, and for a foreigner audience it could be a little bit strong or not comprehensible. Anyway, I would say that this movie is one of the funniest comedies in Spanish cinema. Really enjoyable. I recommend it to you.",

I thought all the actors did a good job playing their roles and I thought that the role of Lisa (played by Nadja Bobyleva) was exactly as we were supposed to see her in this film... cute, quirky, and fun, but not without a true human side. Heinz and Tommy, played by Schreiber and Dentler, were also very likable...they reminded me of Tenoch and Julio (played by Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a nice portrayal of male friendships.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;La ligne de demarcation&quot; is arguably the most successful Chabrol movie of his transitional period -roughly from &quot;l&apos;oeil du malin&quot; (1963) to &quot;la route de Corinthe (1967).\n\nAlthough there are many characters ,this is a well-constructed script ,adapted from the Colonel Remy&apos;s book.The film is dedicated to French men and women who became smugglers and helped soldiers and Jews to cross the demarcation line which divided France into two parts:occupied and unoccupied zone during WW2.\n\nAmong many characters the couple Maurice Ronet/Jean Seberg stands out:he is a defeated officer,his war is over ,and he cannot get over the 1940 debacle.On the contrary her war has only begun .she&apos;s involved in resistance and he thinks at the beginning of the movie that finally what happened was fair cause the Germans are the strongest.Seberg&apos;s beauty illuminates the movie:her face when she hears the coded message &quot;It&apos;s a long way to Gibraltar&quot; is one of the rare moments of happiness in a somber movie.French are not all depicted as heroes.Some are hateful cowards ,who pretend they help the Jews and gives them away to the gestapo.\n\nIn its way,&quot;la ligne de démarcation&quot; foreshadows several aspects of Chabrol future heyday.Two of his favorite actors ,Stephane Audran and Jean Yanne are already here (&quot;le boucher&quot;).The entomological depiction of the villages like in the aforementioned movie is here too.And in some scenes (the attic,the burial, the forest where the patrol is on the prowl) Chabrol displays his skills of master of suspense .Good cast.",

His death-scream still resonates throughout Hollywood — and Bollywood, for that matter — as the model scream for all on-screen dust-biting. As for Rand himself, I know that from his incomparable acting you&apos;d expect him to be a glitzy, world-traveling, supercilious snob, but he&apos;s actually quite a nice guy. (Thought the same can&apos;t be said about his brother, Rory, who, while no actor himself, fancies himself God&apos;s gift to the unevolved.) The rumor through the grapevine is that two rainmaking produces in Hollywood are bruiting about a project called Surf Nazis Are Fixin&apos; to Die II, but it hasn&apos;t got enough funding yet. It seems to be a prequel filmed in the South on the Gulf of Mexico. I think they need to raise about $200. I sure hope that Rand gets the opportunity to reprise his role as Teeth, though by now he&apos;ll probably go by the sobriquet Dentures, which more befits a superannuated man. An Oscar awaits him, no doubt. Or at least a Reynaldo."

The whole movie cuts from scene to scene and has no cohesion. And in the middle of scenes the movie just cuts to a random shot of something. They even say &quot;This is not a movie&quot; when the two cops argue. I couldn&apos;t agree more, this isn&apos;t a movie its a waste of cinematic film and money. Nothing good happened in this film, except when the credits rolled and I left. Although I did enjoy the scene where one guy slapped a blood pack on his throat, it was very easy to see, pretty bad FX. \n\nInstead of calling the movie Last Hour it should be called, Last 5 Minutes, thats all you&apos;ll need to watch to understand the movie since nothing important happens except in the last 5 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes, watching a movie makes you speechless.\n\nSometimes, those worlds live on in your mind instead.\n\nThis second feature from Jérémy Clapin pushes every single part of the medium further. From the acting, the directing, the music, the sound, everything in this piece works in perfect harmony to create something that is not only gripping and fascinating, but containing profound philosophical questions - and even more troubling answers.\n\nThe ticking time bomb of this film hinges on a central idea: what is the value of a life? A trolley problem of sorts engages you in this disturbing question, made even more powerful when turned inwards by the protagonist: i.e., what is the value of MY life?\n\nIt&apos;s an alien movie that lives in the space in between thoughts, some galaxy between your emotions that make them bounce around expertly, right up to this ending you can&apos;t help but fear is coming.\n\nIt&apos;s an alien movie about life, about death, about grief, about loss, about what is lost and what will never be found again. People in the room with me where crying all the way through, and I caught myself shaking in my seat, feeling queasy by the midpoint.\n\nI have no more words to express how moved I&apos;ve been by this. It is truly special. Seeing this at Fantasia film festival, it felt like watching a masterpiece before anyone else. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE. It&apos;s the best of the year, and it&apos;ll be the best I&apos;ll see in a long, long time.",

The film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother Celine, who has had Alzheimer&apos;s Disease for 7 years.\r\n\r\nWhen Celine suffers a mild stroke and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together especially after Celine lost all what little speech and she originally had. &quot;Mum and I would have good conversations. But not anymore. I didn&apos;t lose a mother, I lost a friend&quot;. The duo, staunch Catholics, keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer.\r\n\r\nThe documentary also captures candid interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and atheist with strong views about death in the face of terminal illness. She is first filmed after being diagnosed with &apos;mild cognitive impairment&apos; likely due to systemic fibrosis, an autoimmune disorder which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, vascular dementia causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness.\r\n\r\nIntimate and unflinchingly honest, BEFORE WE FORGET is a film of two women with dementia who live in an Asian society where terminal illnesses and dying remain taboo.",

      "reviewBody": "The handsome Jorge Rivero (&quot;Rio Lobo&quot;) is cast as a playboy named Peter Crane, who loses his grip on reality, often believing himself to be murdering people. Determined to get some help, he checks into a hospital where he&apos;s watched over by psychiatrist Dr. Stone (Richard Conte of &quot;The Godfather&quot;). Stones&apos; associate Dr. Sarah Turner (the stunning Pilar Velazquez, &quot;The Flower with Petals of Steel&quot;) falls in lust with him, and they run off to a cabin together, despite his predicament.\n\nCo-writer / director Mario Siciliano (&quot;Lions of St. Petersburg&quot;) doesn&apos;t concern himself very much with the story making *sense*, really. Where he succeeds the most is in creating a very lurid, and very *surreal* atmosphere, designed to have viewers thinking, &quot;WTF?&quot; on numerous occasions. One scene near the end is particularly indicative of this style, and that involves slimy butler Walter (Eduardo Fajardo, &quot;Django&quot;) and a frog.\n\n&quot;Evil Eye&quot; starts out as if it is going to be more of a horror film, with a decidedly creepy feel. But, by and large, it takes place in a &quot;reality&quot; that keeps shifting. An inspector on the case (Anthony Steffen, &quot;Viva Sabata&quot;) is kind of off in his own movie, but he experiences some of the weirdness, too: like a moment involving a body buried under rubble.\n\nAided and abetted by a wonderful soundtrack by Stelvio Cipriani (&quot;A Bay of Blood&quot;), Siciliano gets solid performances out of his cast, which includes other familiar faces such as Luciano Pigozzi a.k.a. Alan Collins (&quot;Yor: The Hunter from the Future&quot;) and Daniela Giordano (&quot;Violent Rome&quot;).\n\nThe film is loaded with sexy ladies, and bare female flesh, but never gets all that gory, making it fairly sleazy but never all that unpleasant. It&apos;s recommended to fans of Euro genre features who want something a little off the beaten path. The only real disappointment lies in that ending.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

None of us are perfect and I guess it was ok to depict that side also. Glad the movie did not dwell on the negative and Lane and Kellie were able to work things out before he died. I believe I remember when he died. My Dad was a &quot;cowboy&quot;--not rodeo--just a real cowboy for many years.\n\nDon&apos;t miss this movie."

It tells what is was like. The attitudes of people not always very kind. But the love of family was stronger. Today, Dwight lives with our sister Cindy in Norfolk. He loves to color, watch television and listen to music all at the same time. We are so blessed to still have him in our lives.

      "reviewBody": "First of all, this film is not as bad as people are saying it is. Jennifer Lopez is good and Mark Anthony is great. The music alone is worth your money. That, however, is where the praise must end.\n\nUnfortunately, the script seems sloppy. There&apos;s no structure to the story, and the film fails for it. Moments that should be important seem to occur too quickly to feel because the screenwriter(s) seems to lack a sense of pace.\n\nThis could have been helped by a good director. Unfortunately, again, the director was one of the screenwriters, which of course didn&apos;t bode well for his sense of pacing. The film is jarringly disconnected and the characters, even Lavoe himself, are far less developed than they should be.\n\nHad a film like &quot;Ray&quot; never been released, &quot;El Cantante&quot; would have met every expectation of the public. Unfortunately for the filmmakers of &quot;El Cantante&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot; provided a structured script that developed the lead as well as the supporters. &quot;El Cantante&quot; seems to half-develop Puchi and Lavoe, and give really no more than minimal screen time to any supporting cast.\n\nWhich leads to probably the biggest problem of all. This film is told through the eyes of Puchi, Hector&apos;s wife. While this should provide an insight to who Hector was as a person, it&apos;s a very slanted account and the average moviegoer can tell that important things have been left out. This isn&apos;t like &quot;Ray&quot;, where Ray Charles himself was giving the story and therefore could tell things how they were. Puchi (and subsequently the film) only seems to mention the other women in Hector&apos;s life in passing, focuses very little on the tours that Hector undoubtedly went on without her, and really doesn&apos;t let us into the world of the entertainment business in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s. Some of this, I&apos;m sure, is because Puchi just didn&apos;t know about these things. Some of it too, I suspect, is because she didn&apos;t want it in the movie.\n\nThis problem would have been rectified if the film was about Puchi with Hector as a supporting character, and if consequently Puchi had been developed to her fullest capabilities. That did not happen.\n\nOne has to wonder if some of the reason for the lack of character development and pacing is because they caught wind of the other Lavoe film &quot;The Singer&quot; and tried to rush to beat it to the theaters.\n\nIn the end, this film is worth the watch. Is it a classic? No. Is it a good time? Absolutely. There may be another, better Lavoe movie released in our lifetimes. Right now, this film is worth it.\n\nThe Script gets a &quot;D&quot;. The Director gets a &quot;B&quot;, if for no other reason than amazing musical scenes. The Actors get an &quot;A&quot;.\n\nTherefore, I give the film a solid B+.",

He unsuccessfully tries to get news about his father with his acquaintance Colonel Perez (Bob Hoskins). One night, he is summoned to attend the alcoholic British Honorary Consul Charley Fortnum (Michael Caine) in a brothel where he sees a beautiful young prostitute but she goes with another man. When he returns to the Whitehouse, he learns that the prostitute Clara (Elpidia Carrillo) left the place. One day, Charley calls him to examine his wife, and when Eduard turns the light of the room on, he sees that Charley married Clara. Soon he meets her in a store and buys an expensive sunglass to her. Clara goes with him to his apartment and they begin a love affair. When Clara becomes pregnant, Charley believes that the baby is his. Meanwhile Eduardo&apos;s childhood friend Leon (Joaquim De Almeida) visits him in his office and tells that his father is alive in Paraguay. Further, he tells that he plans to abduct the American ambassador and exchange him per political prisoners in Paraguay including his father. However he needs inside information about the visit of the ambassador. What will Eduardo do?\n\n&quot;The Honorary Consul&quot; is a dramatic thriller with romance that does not work well. Eduardo is an unethical doctor and amoral man. His relationship with Clara is cold and he betrays Charley with a great cynicism. The film does not work well and the conclusion is predictable. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Cônsul Honorário&quot; (&quot;The Honorary Consul&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Rather than films like Citizen Kane (1941) and The Lady from Shanghai (1947), neither of which am I a big fan of, Touch of Evil evidences director/writer/star Orson Welles&apos; capacity for cinematic genius. The story is engaging, suspenseful, tight and well paced; the cinematography is consistently beautiful, inventive and symbolic; the setting and overall tone of the film, including the performances, are captivating, yet slightly surreal and otherworldly; and there are many interesting subtexts. This all combines to create a complex artwork that will reward however far a viewer wishes to dig into the film.\n\nBased on a novel by Whit Masterson, Badge of Evil, Touch of Evil is a battle between two policemen--Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Ramon Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston). Parallel to this is a kind of border battle between the United States, represented by Quinlan, and Mexico, represented by Vargas; the film is set in two border towns, frequently crossing over.\n\nAs Touch of Evil opens, we see a bomb being placed in the trunk of a car in Mexico. A construction company owner, Mr. Linnekar, gets in with his girlfriend. Vargas and his new wife, Susan (Janet Leigh), manage to walk along next to the car--they&apos;re all crossing the border into the United States. Shortly after crossing, the bomb goes off. This brings the gruff Quinlan into the picture. His investigation of the bombing brings him into Mexico for suspects. Meanwhile, Vargas and his wife are being threatened by Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a Mexican mob boss, and his underlings. Both Quinlan and Vargas are well respected in their countries, and both are used to getting what they want. But the bombing investigation ends up putting them at loggerheads, and Quinlan gradually turns out to have more than a &quot;touch of evil&quot;.\n\nAs with many of his films, Orson Welles ended up having to battle the studio to realize his artistic vision. Usually, as here, the battle was unsuccessful for him. Despite his 58-page memo detailing various problems with Universal&apos;s non-director supervised reshoots (by Harry Keller) and re-edits, because they felt that Welles&apos; final cut &quot;could use some improvement&quot;, the film was released in a form that was not satisfactory to Welles. The fiasco has resulted in various versions of Touch of Evil appearing throughout the years. The 58-page memo was thought to have been lost, but a copy was discovered relatively recently in Charlton Heston&apos;s possession. The film was recut in 1998 based on Welles&apos; memo. So make sure that you watch the 111-minute version first released by Universal on DVD in 2000.\n\nThe opening scene of Touch of Evil is famous, and rightfully so. Beginning with the timer being set on the bomb, then the bomb being placed in Linnekar&apos;s trunk before he gets into the car, we follow both the car and the relative ebb and flow of Vargases as they roughly walk alongside the car, all in one very long tracking shot that covers a lot of ground and features a lot of unusual angles. Welles stages the scene so that there are all kinds of complex background and foreground elements interacting with the car and our protagonist pedestrians. The suspense built up in this scene is incredible--you just know that bomb is going to go off, but you don&apos;t know just when, or who it is going to hurt. Compositionally, the scene is simply beautiful. The film is worth watching for this opening alone, but the whole of Touch of Evil features similar, meticulously planned artistry, filled with suspense.\n\nWelles as an actor tends to have a very peculiar way of speaking that is full of affectations. Sometimes this can be a detriment to the film, as it was in The Lady from Shanghai. Here, though, the oddity works, and this despite the fact that, like Woody Allen, he seems to direct his whole cast to deliver their dialogue as if they were him. As a result, Touch of Evil has very peculiar, contrapuntal scenes where people frequently talk on top of one another, with odd phrasing. It works because of the particular kinds of personality conflicts that Welles set up in the script. These are people who frequently _would_ talk on top of each other and occasionally not pay attention to each other.\n\nBut that&apos;s not the only odd thing about the film. Welles managed to find locations that, shot in this highly stylized and cinematographically complex film-noir manner, seem almost otherworldly. Except for a couple expansive desert shots, Touch of Evil feels eerily claustrophobic, even though most locations aren&apos;t exactly enclosed. The various modes and settings are all perfect for their dramatic material, which is mostly dark and moody. One change that Universal made was the excision of a lot of comic relief material featuring the Grandi family. Universal was right to cut it, and wisely, Welles agreed.\n\nThe music in the film is also extremely effective but unusual. Most of it is incidental. Latin and rock &apos;n&apos; roll emanates from radios, for example, and the climax intermittently has a repeating, contextually haunting theme from a pianola.\n\nBut of course the story is just as important. Although Welles stated hyperbolically at various points that he was trying to &quot;infuriate&quot; the audience with a somewhat inscrutable plot, and it&apos;s true that the plot isn&apos;t exactly given in a straightforward manner, once you figure out the gist, it&apos;s relatively simple but extremely captivating. At the same time, it is full of symbolism and subtexts, including commentary on justice systems and perhaps some irony about the popular conceptions of the U.S. versus Mexico (made more complex by the fact that Quinlan spends just as much time south of the border and Vargas seems to spend a lot of time north). But as for being annoyed, you&apos;re more likely to become infuriated with Quinlan, who becomes more and more deliciously despicable as the film unfolds.",

The actors start to be annoying, which isn&apos;t good, even if it was a bit intentional. Some story point/jokes only work for German audiences, which on the one hand is nice, but on the other hand, is pretty short sighted for a movie, that should/could appeal to an international audience.\n\nThe movie starts off good though and it wins over audience members, with it&apos;s thin-layered, but fun characters. Unfortunately the plot starts to crumble and the pace isn&apos;t up to speed (no pun intended) too. Some ideas that are hinted aren&apos;t well executed and the overall feeling is that you have been watching a movie that was made &quot;on the fly&quot; (made up as it moves along, with no real script existing, except from some major plot points). A shame then, that this nice idea get&apos;s crumbled under many things that went wrong ... but at least the crew seems to had fun while shooting the movie. Still, even with it&apos;s gross moments, &quot;Borat&quot; is a much better movie, with more sarcastic moments on the American Dream.",

      "reviewBody": "Before you seek this out, know that it is an incomplete restoration. Bits are missing. Some edits are inexplicable and some scenes are muddy.\n\nHaving said that, you will find this to be one of Kurasawa&apos;s most interesting projects. Two things...\n\nOne is that this was made by the bad guys during the war. Incredible atrocities were being committed in the name of racial superiority and the supposition of a refined nobility. Japanese, German and American films (even Italian ones) turned to reinforcing the national character. In the Japanese case, that was linked to matters of honor refracted through Shinto spirituality, honor of a past ideal that never really existed, which in US terms means what &quot;conservatives&quot; tout.\n\nIt was a terrible exercise, more obvious in looking at it from the outside and knowing the context. Kurosawa&apos;s story was every bit as engineered for this purpose as any Reifenstahl project. Oddly, this film is fragmented because the sensors thought it not ennobling enough. One presumes that Kurosawa&apos;s moments of reflection, and possibly a whole love story, were among the half of the movie that was removed. So just on the level of the story itself (a modernized samurai tale), its of interest.\n\nBut it IS Kurasawa, so we have to pay attention to the way the camera engages with the space. This is his very first film as director, though he had written before. In all his films he registers the camera first in a space and then allows action to happen in that space. He has three periods of different types of spatial identity, each illuminating, each inventing new language. But this is before all that and what we have is clear, overt experimentation with space. Some of it is quite thrilling, quite independent of the fascist movement of the story proper.\n\nEven here, he is breaking the rules of flat Japanese composition from eons of painting. He was considered unJapanese in his native country and never very popular. So at the same time that those censors were chopping story and posture they must have been shaking their heads at this three dimensional art, and wondering if they had already lost the war  and if they won, what for?\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Unfortunately, none of it is making much sense to the point of lunacy.\n\n2) Weak visual/audio impact\n\nThis is definitely not a psychological horror.  It relies strictly on audio/visual impact to make you scare.  Unfortunately, it is not really working.  And what&apos;s with the long hair?  Would movie please stop copying from the Ring already???  The face of the ghost, when they eventually show it, actually makes me want to laugh - that&apos;s how bad it is.\n\n3) Weak acting\n\nThe whole irony of this is that Teacher Mo is supposed to be a drama instructor teaching how to act... I guess to talk is one thing, to do is another.\n\n4) Cheap set\n\nThis whole thing feels like a home-made movie.  I can certainly imagine my friends and I get together and produce something like this in a month.\n\nThe only saving grace may be the good looking Cissy...  And no, there is no gratuitous naked scene that you will otherwise find in other cheap horror movie in the same class.",

      "reviewBody": "I must admit that when homosexuality becomes part of the theme in a film I tend to get uncomfortable and prefer to watch something else. However this was not the case with this film from Catalunya: it held my interest from the beginning to the (predictable) end. Adapted from his own Catalan novel, Benet i Jornet has managed to maintain an almost theatre-like script and screenplay, except for the fact that there are many and frequent changes of scenario. The interweaving of the main characters is well accomplished, wonderful interpretations by both Josep María Pou and Mario Gas, as well as good work by David Selvas in the difficult rôle of a gay hustler, in all cases somewhat overshadowing the truly universal Rosa María Sardá. What she does is well done, but the architecture of the film does not allow her to portray what she is worth. Ventura Pons did not have to work too hard to make this film a success, given the performances of his actors.\n\nDefinitely for adult audiences who are mature enough to understand the complications of delicate friendships with an aging and terminally sick homosexual as the centre point of conflicting aims, hopes, desires.. Try to see it in Catalan if you can: I had to see this one in the dubbed Spanish version on the national RTVE. I go along with the IMDb vote of 8 from 53 votes.",

      "reviewBody": "Fist of Legend, IMHO, is the best Jet Li movie to date, and among the best martial arts movies ever made.  A darker, more serious film than the bulk of Li&apos;s work, it shines in both story and action.  Reminiscent of OOIC in tempo and, to a lesser degree, tone, Fist of Legend surpasses its better known predecessor in intensity and elegance.\n\nUsing minimal wires, the fight scenes are absolutely breathtaking.  What they lack in wire-fu acrobatics and superhuman theatrics, they more than make up for in precision, creativity, believability and plotline relevance. Three of my all time favorite kung fu fight scenes are in this single movie. While still a well told story, there is more than enough kung fu for even the most die hard.  We simply don&apos;t get to see Jet Li fight like this anymore.\n\nJet Li, as always, is phenomenal, and his opponents are both skilled and artfully characterized.  His serious portrayal of Chen Zhen far surpasses his Jackie Chan-esque comedic roles, yet retains a vulnerability not found in Wong Fei Hung.  While originated by Bruce Lee, Chen Zhen was a role made for Jet Li.\n\nThe plot (as I&apos;m sure you know) is derived from the classic Fists of Fury, but the depth and characterization of this rendition far surpasses the original.  The political and racial turmoil surrounding the characters is more capably written and tastefully portrayed, never subtracting from the action.\n\nAll in all, a top notch effort, and the best blend of storytelling and kung fu I&apos;ve encountered.",

I dug the hell out of this movie because it didn&apos;t take itself too seriously. It looks like they had a fun time making it and God bless em&apos; for it! You started to get a little idea of the outrageousness of it all when Chiun begins talking about all the other great martial arts as mere shadows compared with his fighting style. And then there&apos;s the water-walking or running toward the end of the film. And the super secret organization (with only 3 members!) answering only to the President. What a hoot!

The actors are all the best French climbers of the &apos;50 and as such may be reguarded more as a documentary than an action or &apos;extreme sport&apos; movie.\n\nIt recounts a day of climbing in Chamonix. Different parties are at the refuge, they tell tales, get ready for their day, then go climbing. Some are novices on easy route, others are guides with clients, others are pro climbers putting up a new route. Things happen, small things like getting lost, big things like rescuing a snowblind climber.\n\nTalking about realism, there is no comparision with Eiger Sanction (Clint Eastwood), K2, Cliffhanger (Stalone) or The Vertical Limit.\n\nThis movie showed continuously in Chamonix for about 30 years (where I saw it). The title refers to the very dark and clean mountain sky where you can sometimes see stars during the day.",

The novel by Graham Greene is set in French Indo-China in 1952 and this version is prophetic. The other one surely has the advantage of a whole lot of hindsight. This film done in 1958 has a lot of foresight.\n\nI don&apos;t know what to make of Audie Murphy&apos;s character, it&apos;s never brought out, but he seems to be a CIA man. In the novel he&apos;s from the Ivy League, but due to Murphy&apos;s speech pattern, his character is from Texas. He&apos;s bringing in plastic for industrial purposes purportedly, but we see how the &apos;plastic&apos; is really used.\n\nThe political picture of Indo-China in 1952 has the United States already seeing the French won&apos;t hold on and they&apos;re getting ready to put in their own surrogate in when the French do fall. Murphy is forever talking about a &apos;third force&apos; who will bring western style democracy.\n\nMurphy also becomes romantically involved with Giorgia Moll who is also the mistress of British newspaper correspondent Michael Redgrave. The rivalry between the two prevents either from acting coherently though Redgrave has a much better idea of what&apos;s really happening.\n\nInterestingly enough the United Kingdom was also fighting to hold on in Malaya the same way that the French were trying to hold on to Indo-China next door. The British were far more successful though.\n\nThe Quiet American should have been seen by policy makers in Washington through six administrations in America. A lot of valuable lessons could have been learned and a lot of valuable lives might never have been lost.",

It&apos;s not &quot;realistic&quot; in its technicalities (winning three consecutive times by betting on a single roulette number happens ONLY in the movies), but I don&apos;t think it wants to be; what it&apos;s trying to get at is the psychology of gambling, and at that it succeeds (in fact, it shows two different &quot;types&quot; of players: the wetting-his-feet and the full addict). This movie, which offers a rare view of the high and low life in and around the Nice and Monte Carlo casinos circa 1963, has the immediacy and spontaneity that the French New Wave often strived for, minus any of the pretentiousness (just compare it with Godard&apos;s not dissimilar &quot;Pierrot Le Fou&quot;). Jeanne Moreau sports an iconic look and plays a daringly flawed female character; the much lesser-known internationally Claude Mann is also very good. It&apos;s a minor classic. ***1/2 out of 4.",

      "reviewBody": "More than practically every film I&apos;ve seen before in my life, &quot;Grudge Song&quot; emphasizes the essentialness of one certain director linked to a cinematic franchise. Shunya Ito directed the first three installments of the &quot;&quot;Female Prisoner: Scorpion&quot; series and they were simply phenomenal and pretty much flawless. For this fourth entry, Yasuharu Hasabe took place in the director&apos;s seat and promptly the narrative ingenuity as well as the stylish characteristics notably lowered in quality. By no means I intend to claim that &quot;Grudge Song&quot; is a bad film  far from it, as you can derive from the rating I&apos;ve given  but it nearly isn&apos;t as breathtakingly awesome as the previous ones. But in all honesty, Hasabe can&apos;t be blamed entirely, as he actually just remained faithful to his own personalized style and filming methods. This man also directed uncompromising and vastly outrageous Cat-III movies with delicious sounding titles such as &quot;Rape! The 13th Hour&quot;, &quot;Assault: Jack the Ripper&quot; and even &quot;Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter&quot;, so you honestly can&apos;t expect this man to alter his style towards a more elegant and suggestive type of exploitation cinema. The fourth film is much sleazier and straightforward, with less likable character drawings and visually dazzling gimmicks. Hasabe obviously didn&apos;t care too much for the complexities of part three (&quot;Beast Stable&quot;) or the deliriousness of part two (&quot;Jailhouse 41&quot;) and returned to the gritty in-your-face mentality of the original. The script is largely a re-run of familiar themes. Nami is still a fugitive from the law and she has yet another relentless copper obsessively chasing her. She finds shelter, and even affection, in the arms of a porno theater employee who still has an old score to settle with the police. But when he get captured by the police and brutally interrogated, he betrays Nami&apos;s hideout place. Back in prison our heroine picks up her old habits of causing riots, manipulating personnel and fellow inmates and  of course  attempting to escape from the hangman&apos;s rope. &quot;Grudge Song&quot; is definitely still a good movie, far superior to the majority of contemporary exploitation movies for sure, but a weaker entry in the series. The plot only offers few surprises and Nami suddenly transformed into a genuine antagonist to the audience as well. You always sympathized with her before, but here she commits a handful of crimes that can&apos;t possibly be justified. She also talks a little more in this film, and her silence was part of her charming personality in the other installments. Talking in terms of visual decoration, &quot;Grudge Song&quot; is fairly mediocre with only a couple of noteworthy highlights (like the truly menacing POV-shots of the noose in the middle of the prison&apos;s yard). This film also immediately marked the end of the &quot;official&quot; Female Scorpion cycle. The successors, appropriately entitled NEW Female Prisoner, don&apos;t star Meiko Kaji in the title role any longer and aren&apos;t directed by any of the above-mentioned directors. I&apos;m curious about the remaining two films (which I own in a fancy box set), but I&apos;m keeping the expectations rather low just to be sure.",

      "reviewBody": "There are a countless movies over the Jesus&apos;s life, instead this one is applying just in his final days after the triumphal arrival in Jerusalem and his trial told under Matthew&apos;s gospel, strangely just four gospels accepted in the bible have some differents versions, each one has a little disagreement, easily understandable of course, these old testimonies were put together centuries ahead, this great french production is really fine, a little sins as the Jerusalem&apos;s architecture is based in Egyptian&apos;s large buildings otherwise is almost perfect, Robert Le Vigan as Jesus and a still young Jean Gabin as Ponce Pilatos were flawless!!!\n\nResume:\n\nFirst watch: 2018 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 8.25",

It had in my opinion a very good plot. I thought it was very cool how they went into detail about the past of Father Merrin while still focusing on what Regan is going through, and I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t do the same monster. I really liked how they set Father Lemont up to have to choose between the angelic Regan and the sinful Regan,and speaking of Regan Linda Blair was awesome. Going back to the end, I love how even though they looked the same and were dressed the same she managed to make the costume work, and make it look like an innocent sort of dress for one, yet at the same time the evil Regan looked sexy in the same dress!All in all I thought it was a darn good sequel and give it a 7/10!",

Interesting concepts are presented, but it turns out to be your run-of-the-mill thriller entertainment with recognizable actors. Nothing bad. It just took the Hollywood direction. The suspense is great in some scenes, especially in the first half. When we get to the climax things start to become too convenient and even a little predictable. What the movie really utilize well are the main leads. The characters are like-able which is super important here because you have to care for them when they are on the run from the invaders. The antagonists are annoying in just the right way. Imagine someone you know loosing all of their emotions and becoming an outer shelf of what that person used to be. That&apos;s a pretty scary idea. The movie plays it safe. What it lacks is some extra emotional punch and we never truly get that. So, I think the filmmakers should have gone for something even riskier at the end. The impact would have been much better. We get the Hollywood finale. And I guess it works in some ways because less people will feel paranoid after watching it.\n\nIt&apos;s alright. You can put the movie on and be entertained by the suspense and seeing Nicole Kidman be chased by weird stale people. The look of the picture is pretty nice. The blue-ish color tint fits the movie well. You should probably stick to the original &quot;Body Snatchers&quot;, but if you wanna go for something that&apos;s easier to process then check this one out.",

      "reviewBody": "I take my comment to be an appendix to the &quot;portrait by indirection&quot; comment;one question though: isn&apos;t his geography teacher exactly like his mother&apos;s paramour? \n\nThat said, I really enjoyed the ironic clin d&apos;oeil to the nouvelle nouvelle vague territory, when our hero Etienne kicks his best friend Ludo into assuming grins that portray &quot;angst&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;, etc, as a promising actor, all in mocking succession; I would even go that far as to claim that it was intended as an irony-a-clef towards Louis Garrel&apos;s usual persona! Or the subtlety of turning cinema verite into something else.\n\nAnd mostly I enjoyed the almost effortless and sudden passage of the triply difficult portrayal of what happens in the end: Etienne surely contemplates suicide when he leaves his camera at the Falaises and stands at the edge - why? Was it the humiliating instance of his &apos;stepfather&apos; as he calls him, even though and because he desires him, starts to strip, then retracts his - was it an offer, albeit a subconscious one, or the usual unaffected and brutal masculine perplexity facing intimacy? We can certainly hear an edge in Etienne&apos;s voice even as he firmly, and perhaps for the first time standing for himself (and his camera), continues filming that lewd scene. Or was it remorse because of the accident?\n\nBut quicker than our questions we see a handsome new face staring into Etienne&apos;s camera, and filming him without his usual uneasiness when shot by another; a slight, unconvincing protest as he rushes to his new face because, as this, his first lover tells him, in a kind of french idiom, he will change his face after he will have made love, and as they start having fun, Etienne no longer needs his camera, nor do we. The end. After all the straining footage of his, finally, not-so-true life in Rouen, we just see something flickering past us: no more who this guy is, or what he does just to keep the empty suspense go on, but we pass to something secretive that we don&apos;t witness, his true life in Rouen! That, for me, keeps this film from turning into a trick: it remains true as a portrait where the line between what is spontaneous and what is premeditated remains blurred, as perhaps in adolescence and its seemingly eternal waiting of the real life to begin. Just where we thought real life means action, well, it just is a secret."

      "name": "976-Evil II: Dialing Up a Sequel with No Signal",
      "reviewBody": "Horror sequels are a curious breed. Often, they struggle to capture the essence of what made their predecessors successful, or they amplify the wrong elements in a misguided attempt to outdo the original. &quot;976-Evil II&quot; (1991) is one such film-a movie that exists in the shadow of its predecessor but ends up being a fascinatingly chaotic and campy ride. Directed by Jim Wynorski, a prolific filmmaker known for his exploitation films, this sequel dials into a horror subgenre that revels in its own absurdity, delivering a mixed bag of supernatural thrills, low-budget effects, and unintentional comedy.\n\nPlot Overview\n\n&quot;976-Evil II&quot; follows the cursed phone line concept from the original film but takes it in an entirely different, and somewhat nonsensical, direction. The story centers around Robin (Debbie James), a college student who starts experiencing terrifying visions after answering a call from the demonic hotline. Enter Grubeck (Rene Assa), a sadistic college dean who gains the ability to astral project and commit murders thanks to the satanic power of the 976-evil hotline. As Robin teams up with Spike (Patrick O&apos;Bryan), a returning character from the first film, they must confront Grubeck&apos;s ghostly rampage before he completes his sinister plans.\n\nAesthetics and Direction: Wynorski&apos;s direction is a testament to the &quot;more is more&quot; philosophy that dominated low-budget horror in the early 90s. The film is a hodgepodge of horror tropes, from possession and slasher elements to outlandish supernatural occurrences. The effects are a particular highlight (or lowlight, depending on your perspective)-with Grubeck&apos;s ability to astral project leading to a series of bizarre death scenes that feel more like a fever dream than a cohesive narrative.\n\nOne particularly memorable scene involves a victim being trapped inside a television, forced to live through a warped version of &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot; that ends in her brutal demise. It&apos;s moments like these where the film&apos;s absurdity reaches a peak, offering a glimpse into the kind of surreal horror that can only come from a director unafraid to push the boundaries of good taste.\n\nVisually, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is drenched in neon lighting, fog machines, and quick cuts, creating a disorienting atmosphere that mirrors the disjointed nature of the plot.\n\n**Performances:** The acting in &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is a mixed bag, with some performances adding to the film&apos;s campy charm while others fall flat. Rene Assa as Grubeck chews the scenery with relish, delivering lines with a menacing glee that makes his character&apos;s descent into madness all the more entertaining. His performance is one of the film&apos;s saving graces, providing a villain who is both ridiculous and genuinely unsettling.\n\nDebbie James, as the film&apos;s final girl, brings a certain vulnerability to Robin, though her character is often overshadowed by the over-the-top events surrounding her. Patrick O&apos;Bryan reprises his role as Spike, but his character feels more like a plot device than a fully fleshed-out protagonist. He&apos;s the link to the original film, yet he spends most of the movie reacting to the insanity around him rather than driving the plot forward.\n\nThe tone is where the movie truly sets itself apart from its predecessor. While the original &quot;976-Evil&quot; (1988), directed by Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger fame, had a darker and more serious approach to its horror, the sequel veers into outright camp. This shift in tone makes &quot;976-Evil II&quot; feel less like a continuation and more like a parody of the original. The film&apos;s blend of horror and humor doesn&apos;t always work, leading to moments that are more confusing than scary. However, for fans of B-movies, this tonal inconsistency can be part of the film&apos;s appeal.\n\nCultural Impact and Legacy: In the grand scheme of horror cinema, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is a footnote-an oddity that&apos;s more likely to be found in a midnight movie marathon than in any serious discussion of the genre. Yet, it&apos;s precisely this obscurity that gives the film its cult status. Like many low-budget horror sequels of its time, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; appeals to a niche audience who revel in its absurdity, its flaws, and its unapologetic embrace of the ridiculous.\n\nThe film also serves as a reminder of the creative risks taken by directors like Wynorski, who were willing to push the boundaries of what horror could be, even if the results were often more laughable than terrifying. In a way, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is a celebration of the excesses of early 90s horror, a time when filmmakers were experimenting with new ideas, technologies, and ways to shock audiences-no matter how bizarre the outcome.\n\nConclusion: &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is not a good film by traditional standards. It&apos;s poorly paced, questionably acted, and the plot is a disjointed mess. But that&apos;s exactly what makes it such a fascinating watch. For fans of schlocky, so-bad-it&apos;s-good cinema, this sequel offers a treasure trove of outrageous moments and unintentional comedy that&apos;s hard to find in today&apos;s more polished horror fare.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a coherent, genuinely scary movie, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; will disappoint. But if you&apos;re in the mood for a surreal, campy trip through the wild world of early 90s horror, this film might just be your perfect midnight dial-in. Whether you love it or hate it, &quot;976-Evil II&quot; is a film that demands to be seen-if only to be believed.",

      "reviewBody": "Lubitsch&apos;s charming masterpiece, so often imitated and re-adapted since it appeared in 1940, is one of the very few films that can be called perfect. There is not a shot, a line, a performance, or a moment in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER that isn&apos;t exactly right.  Everything fits together and runs like a Swiss watch.\n\nWith its flawless screenplay and cast, it&apos;s the most subtle, discreet, and understated of romantic comedies.  What other film manages to be so warm-hearted yet so rigorously unsentimental?  What other movie story is so exquisitely planned and executed?\n\nMargaret Sullaven isn&apos;t sexy, it&apos;s true, but this isn&apos;t a film about sex. It&apos;s about love in the human heart and mind.  A sexier actress would have thrown things out-of-balance.  As always, Lubitsch knew exactly what he was doing.  Just as he knew ace comedian Frank Morgan (the WIZARD OF OZ&apos;s Wizard) had hidden depth, which this film so beautifully reveals.\n\nThey don&apos;t make them like this anymore -- they didn&apos;t make them like this back then, either.  SHOP was under-rated in 1940, when it appeared.  It&apos;s simply too subtle, too intelligent and disciplined for the average viewer or critic.\n\nNothing overdone or exaggerated.  Nothing out-of-place.  If Mozart had been a filmmaker, he would have made this one.  Warm, charming, adult, quiet, intelligent, knowing, touching ... perfection."

The real strong point of the movie in my view are three main characters, Akshaye Khanna, Paresh Rawal and Arshad Warsi. All of them have given a great performance.\n\nFrom scene one, till last, this movie is a laugh riot. The movie is an adaptation of the 1991 hit Malayalam movie Godfather, then also Priydarshan has crafted a real gem here. All the characters are so written. Be it Arshad, Akshaye, Paresh or Sunil Shetty, Jackie Shroff and Arbaaz Khan. A special mention for the ever awesome Amrish Puri, as I suppose this was his last movie as an actor. He is amazing and so nautral in every scene.\n\nSupporting cast have done a great job. Music is good and some of the songs are really well made. Overall a good family entertainer.",

      "reviewBody": "Accomplished actor Nicholas Bro wants to make a movie. He asks his friend and director Christopher Boe for his help, and being the good guy Boe is, he gives him a camera and the essentials to start his film. Bro&apos;s (not Boe) idea is to shoot a love-story involving himself and his wife. I forget specifics at the moment, but I think it was an attempt on his part to fix his struggling relationship. Well, it backfires, and the basis of the movie is Nicholas attempting to finish his movie, thus showing his wife how much he loves her, and ultimately getting her back. The results are nothing less than eye-opening.\n\nThis is my first peek into a Christopher Boe film and I must say I&apos;m very impressed. I&apos;ve heard he&apos;s one of the world&apos;s leading young directors and I can easily back that statement. Before I gush over Boe anymore, I do have to also commend Nicholas&apos;s performance as well. It was really something else, and almost at times, felt too realistic. Getting back to Boe, and it&apos;s related to Nicholas in a way, the reason why I was so sucked into this film was because of the realism. The ideas and writing for Bro&apos;s character hooked me in on a level that screamed real life tragedy.\n\nWhat real life tragedy? What kind of tragedy? As the climax of the movie began I was almost immediately reminded of the movie, The Video Diary of Ricardo Lopez. It was a graphic, tragic and a very emotional real-life film that displayed mental problems on a level I&apos;ve never seen before. I never in my life would have thought I would see a movie that would create a comparable feeling that that film gave off. But it did, and I applaud them for doing so.",

The plot has been done a zillion times. I pretty much knew what was going to happen twenty minutes into the film. What saves the film from being one huge predictable snooze fest is that the author is clever enough not to fall into too many clichés so things seem possible if not probable. And there is the excellent casting of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Their characters are quirky enough to be believable and both are very sympathetic. And there&apos;s no silly Hollywood ending with rockets bursting and doves flying into the sunset. There&apos;s a chance they might make it as a couple despite differences in age, culture and countries or they might be in for a huge disappointment and hurt--something both have known in their lives.\n\nIf you&apos;re expecting a movie that will entertain, be free of gratuitous sex scenes and violence with a charming backdrop of London landmarks, then this film is for you.",

It was a great amount of fun to do. The creative team came from both film and theatre industry. I&apos;d just finished a pirate movie with Tommy Lee Jones, Michael O&apos;Keefe and Jenny Seagrove and a lot of theatre. Michael (Hurst) was also a fellow theatre actor and we went on after this to do a couple of stage plays together. As was also noted, Michael went on to do &apos;Hercules&apos;. At the time, Fangoria was the genre magazine of choice, and, with David (Blyth) and Murray (Newey - RIP) and the script by Michael Heath, with the 80&apos;s sex chic of the nurses, designed by Micahel Glock, we hit Auckland with all the energy that a 4 week shoot can muster. It&apos;s amazing to read comments from watchers/viewers some, what? 25 years later! Don&apos;t get too analytical....we just went for the jugular and hoped that somewhere along the line it&apos;d all make sense! Along the way we shot stuff in a deserted and rather creepy abattoir, the tunnels on the island off Auckland city, and got right into ridged knives with back splatter."

Pryor successfully goes for a major change of pace in this tale of a trio of auto assembly workers (Pryor, Harvey Keitel, Yaphet Kotto) who are all having some major home, work and family problems and how they decide to solve them by developing a scheme to rob the union for which they work. When they put their plan to work, things eventually go from bad to worse. It may sound like a crime comedy caper with Pryor portraying his usual con man role but it&apos;s far more serious than that and Pryor proves that he doesn&apos;t have to get laughs in order to deliver a good film performance."

      "reviewBody": "THE WORLD IN HIS ARMS is the sort of film Hollywood made in the 1930s and early 40s and might have starred John Wayne, Errol Flynn, James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson--it&apos;s very easy to imagine any of these men in such a formulaic programmer. By the 1950s, such adventure films were practically gone--replaced with more realistic films about more contemporary topics. Now I am NOT complaining about this film--I happen to like these old fashioned films. Sure, the characters and situations were unrealistic, but this sort of escapism is something many will enjoy.\n\nAs for the choice of Gregory Peck, he wasn&apos;t bad--even though he isn&apos;t generally the &quot;type&quot; to play this sort of macho role. Now this isn&apos;t to say that Peck wasn&apos;t manly enough, but seeing him as a guy who loves loose women, fighting and chaos is certainly a departure from his typical film! Even such seafaring films as CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER and MOBY DICK feature Peck in a much more somber, intellectual and dependable sort of man than the slightly crazy Captain Clark in THE WORLD IN HIS ARMS. Again, I am not complaining--just pointing out that this role is a departure for Peck.\n\nPeck&apos;s love interest in the film is Ann Blyth, who is quite lovely but also appears too young for Peck. This is due to Blyth looking much younger than she was (24) and because the height difference between them (more than a foot) tended to make her look even younger. She wasn&apos;t bad--just an unusual choice.\n\nThe film begins in San Francisco. Peck and his crew have just arrived with a ship filled with seal furs. They are rich and in a mood to celebrate. However, an envoy from a Russian Princess (Blyth) tries to engage the ship to take her to safety (she is running from an arranged marriage). Peck refuses outright--he just wants to unwind and have fun. In an odd move, Blyth herself meets Peck and doesn&apos;t identify who she is. Peck is taken with her and makes plans to marry her--at which point the Russian husband she is supposed to marry shows up to claim his bride--leaving Peck disappointed and furious. Will Peck catch up to this Princess? Will she be able to avoid a loveless marriage? Well, tune in for yourself and see.\n\nThe film has a lot of pluses. First, the color print and cinematography are just lovely. It&apos;s the sort of 1950s color that is bold and prettier than real life but not as bold and garish as early Technicolor. Combined with a rousing musical score, the film has lovely aesthetics. The film also features some excellent actors. In addition to Peck and Blyth, Anthony Quinn in on hand in a not particularly subtle but enjoyable role as Peck&apos;s nemesis as is John McIntire--an under-appreciated but excellent supporting actor (who, in parts of this film, looks like the spitting image of General Sherman).\n\nNow the film is not without its faults. There is a rather poor use of rear projection in the seal hunting scenes--even by 1950s standards. Also, the story, at times, seems more like comic book or dime novel due to characters who are not exactly believable. It&apos;s the sort of film, however, with no pretensions--it&apos;s not high art or an Oscar contender and never seemed like it was intended as this.\n\nOverall, a great adventure film for you to just turn off your brain and enjoy. Great old time fun.\n\nBy the way, much of the film revolves around seal hunting, which wasn&apos;t considered such a big deal in 1952. Starting in the 1960s, worldwide opposition to seal harvesting became an issue and so today some might hate this movie. Try to keep it in historical context and enjoy the film for what it is.\n\nBy the way, considering how evil and stupid the Russians are generally shown to be in this film, I wonder if perhaps it was all meant as a metaphor for US-Soviet relations at the time?",

Adapted from the musical &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, this film is crammed with one-liners and quotes that will ricochet in your memory eternally.  The songs are amongst the best to have come out of India during that whole period, and are instantly recognisable today.  Having grown up under the Amitabh umbrella and seen all of the classics, this film still shines as one of his most memorable ventures.  A playful look at a family of 7 brothers living on a farm, with all it&apos;s ups and downs, tragedies and laughter, and the impressive effort by all of the cast, it&apos;s truly a gem.",

Helga is the girl who Fabio woos with a stolen salt shaker. She is played by Janet Agren who shows us her upper body endowment in some scenes.\n\nGood scenes of the streets and canals of Venice or some other city with streets and canals. The boat chase is much like what we saw in Gator and Swamp Girl. The car chase scenes are done nicely but nowhere nearly as good as Bullitt or The French Connection. The foot chase scenes on rooftops and city streets are well done. The music throughout sucks.\n\nAssi Dayan is the son of the famous Israeli General Moshe Dayan. Both Assi Dayan and Fabio Testi are still active in film-making. They both have likable personalities and nice faces with interesting accents. Think of Daffy and Donald Duck with better eyelashes.\n\nThe story is far more applicable to today&apos;s world than it was to the 1970s world of moviegoers. It has a plot that incorporates terrorists seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nThe bad guys look very bad. If you have ever found yourself annoyed with an organ grinder&apos;s music, there is one scene in this film you will enjoy.\n\nAn old cargo ship becomes a nice setting for target practice late in the movie. The bullets hit everything except the good guys.\n\nWith the two lead guys being so good looking at that time, the director was somehow not able to insert a scene that had any real sex appeal. Even when Fabio is in bed with a girl it does not become intimate or interesting. The director should have stuck to the acting and plot development and left the nudity and sex scenes for better directors. Blake Edwards could have found much better music. J. Daniel Cadinot could have done the buildup to the nude scenes.\n\nNot a bad movie, especially in today&apos;s world.\n\nTom Willett",

But Ploy was a positive surprise! After the Invisible Waves which seemed to carry on with the ideas of Last Life in The Universe (hence, the director couldn&apos;t find or just didn&apos;t bother looking for a new, more creative approach) this was a completely new refreshment... just like Last Life in The Universe was at its time. I don&apos;t know if this is the best film of this prominent director (I cannot make my mind up... it&apos;s still between 6ixtynin9, Last Life and Ploy) but with Ploy he showed that he&apos;s still fresh and can strike hard unlike many &quot;one movie&quot; directors who are made famous by one appearance and then simply decline with other works. This is not the case here and this makes my sight attached to Pen Ek&apos;s works as closely as never before. A brilliant piece from one of the greatest directors.",

      "reviewBody": "Not only an excellent leading cast, Alec Guinness superb as the curmudgeony earl and Ricky Schroeder believably charming as the American boy thrust into the world of the English nobility, the minor characters are also exceptional: Eric Porter as the earl&apos;s steward and Patrick Stewart as the head coachman both particularly memorable. The pace of the film is also excellent, events happen and characters develop with interesting detail but without over emphasis or  very drawn out scenes. Overall, in our family&apos;s top 20 or even top 10 fims. So, why on earth can&apos;t the studio issue this film on VHS or DVD! Considering the absolute rubbish that is now available even on DVD there must surely be a market for an excellent seasonal &quot;family&quot; film like this. We made a recording when this film was shown on TV sometime in the early 80s, since when it has been played at least twice a year for the last 20 years and both sound and vision have now deteriorated to a point where it is almost unwatchable.  PLEASE! someone, pass this request on to the studio and get it issued on DVD.  We know there are many families like us who would be happy to pay £15 or so for a new version to play for the next 20 years.",

The film is basically comprised of interviews with people who have lost their jobs due to outsourcing and interviews with various professionals about said subject, as well as NAFTA.\n\nThe film&apos;s strong suit is the interviews with the workers. What I would have liked to have additionally seen are three things.\n\nFirst, the writer/director/host is a little bland. I know this is a documentary on an abstract topic, but he&apos;s still bland even considering said factor.\n\nSecond, it&apos;s too short, and this could have been remedied by the third thing I would have liked to see, namely some interviews with people who disagree that outsourcing is bad for the U.S. economy and/or proponents of NAFTA and other free trade agreements. If credibility is key then you need opposing viewpoints. Of course maybe such people were asked and all declined, but if that was the case this should have been mentioned.\n\nAll in all worth seeing. If you are completely in favor of outsourcing you will definitely find the film to be biased though."

The cinematography is amazing at times - and there are certain images that will stick with you long after you leave the movie. But be warned - this is not a light movie, it moves you to despair, challenges you, and in my own experience gives you nightmares. having said all that I am glad I saw it and would recommend it to you all",

But, how long will it be before this big secret is revealed? And, isn&apos;t Julia engaged to a hotshot international correspondent anyway? This is a cute movie in a cactus setting. Davis and Keaton are funny and believable as the ace writers. A scene where they speak/duel before a group of school children is priceless. The supporting cast is nice, the script is quite good, and the costumes and scenery more than adequate. And, yes, the movie has some good messages about politics, wolves in sheeps clothing, and true believers.

      "reviewBody": "There is a vile murderer lose in London, not since the terror of Jack The Ripper has London been subjected to such gruesome doings. The killers trademark is that he severs the forefingers of his victims, the police are baffled. Enter Holmes and Watson, called into action once again, but even the intrepid Holmes is baffled. There is more to the case than meets the eye, and could there be on old adversary behind the murders?.\n\nThe Woman in Green is the eleventh of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes film&apos;s starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson, and the eighth of the eleven directed by Roy William Neill. Partly based around Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s-The Adventure of the Empty House, The Woman In Green {ambigious title in context of the films content} continues the dark path trodden in the previous film, House of Fear (1945). As Holmes ruefully observes another female victim on the slab in the mortuary he muses &quot;fiend that did this,&quot; and then promises to crack the case. It&apos;s Holmes obsession with the case, and the macabre nature of the story that carries the audience thru it&apos;s very chatty first half. That the darkness lifts at the midpoint is no bad thing due to the introduction of a rather well known foe from Holmes&apos; past. However one has to wonder, as good as the &quot;twist&quot; is, if the film would have been better off staying in darker territory? You see the second half eases in tone as Watson slips into, what is admittedly always great fun, comedy mode and the babe of the piece {a smashing Hillary Brooke} becomes focal along with he who shall not be named. It works of course, this is Holmes trying to crack a devilish case, one that will encompass a new form of trickery in the pantheon of villainy. And then there is some fabulous shots used by Neill, one particular sequence involving swirling water and a white flower is very memorable. While the ending, in true Holmes, Watson and villain style, does its job all told. It&apos;s just one can&apos;t help feeling that this should have been far better than it eventually turned out to be. Still a fine series entry mind, and arguably the last time a Rathbone film had that delicious dark undercurrent to it. 7/10",

Marlon Brando is funny and witty and is well supported by Faye Dunaway in the marital relationship of a couple heading for retirement and the best times of their lives.\n\nJohnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of all time. His performance is true and expressive and I just love his smile. I compare this performance to that of his character of Jack Sparrow in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. \n\nI have no problem, whatsoever, recommending this movie to everyone.",

The role was simply no longer taken away from him. The rest of the cast (Li Paelz, Arthur Brauss, the handsome Jimmy Shaw) also looked quite passable, but failed to remain memorable. Very bad: Veronique Vendell, the producer&apos;s new partner. A Dorothee Parker was made of completely different stuff. Tempi Passati! The time of the Hong Kong rip-offs was simply over.\n\nThe real hits were now produced by the Hong Kong film studios with their own stories.

      "reviewBody": "This Laurel and Hardy silent short might seem very familiar to Laurel and Hardy fans even if you&apos;ve never seen the film before. That&apos;s because it uses a formula that worked well in many of their shorts. Basically, Stan and Ollie are trying to act tough (this time spurred on by two cute ladies) and after a small altercation develops, the two take the &quot;tit for tat&quot; notion to amazing heights. In this case, a tiny fender bender results in car destruction on a massive and hilarious scale. A few Laurel and Hardy films that have used similar plot construction are the great BIG BUSINESS, BATTLE OF THE CENTURY, TIT FOR TAT and the final portion of MEN O&apos;WAR (which, incidentally ALSO has them playing sailors on shore leave).\n\nSo, if the formula is so familiar, why bother watching TWO TARS? Well, like the other films listed (and others), TWO TARS is just plain funny. Period. While the first 75% of the film is mildly funny, seeing the end results of all the destruction. The many, many sight gags are very reminiscent of the Keystone comedies and must have, for the time, cost a lot of money.\n\nNow there is a problem with viewing this film, however. There are no DVD sets of the existing prints of all the Laurel and Hardy films. There was a videotape set produced many years ago, but it&apos;s out of print. As a result, I know of no place where you can now view this rare Laurel and Hardy film except online. Under Google Video, there&apos;s an old Blackhawk films print (probably taken from an 8 or 16mm home movie) but there is no incidental music--just silence. But, even given these limitations, it&apos;s still well worth finding and watching. Not the best Laurel and Hardy film, it IS among the better ones this fine team produced.\n\nFYI--This short is currently playing at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with organ accompaniment. I have no idea how much longer this will be, but it&apos;s sure worth seeing--even if much of the art in the museum is too sophisticated for 99% of the public.",

The shock value comes from other places--the content, the dialogue.  This is a very thought-provoking and smart movie, not at all preachy (and it easily could have been preachy). The acting is unforced and its story does not fall into the &quot;American History X&quot; trap:  Its main character does not become an &quot;all race loving&quot; good guy.  The protagonist in &quot;The Believer&quot; is a tortured soul, and his fate (although somewhat predictable) is fitting after the events in the film.  This movie is another example that cable movies occasionally surpass theatrical movies in their subject matter and execution.  Very well done."

But it is Charles Laughton (also Oscar-nominated) who gives his greatest performance as the captain who is harsh, strict and unforgiving. However, his true skills are shown when he is thrown off the ship, but never gives up and returns to safety in a small boat with limited men and supplies. The primary actors are solid and the shooting locales are breath-taking. Frank Lloyd&apos;s direction lifts a somewhat questionable screenplay to safer waters and the film turns into a Hollywood classic by its final act. 5 stars out of 5."

Made during the transition between his early experimental short films and his later more narrative (and more celebrated) ones, his free flowing structure is at its best here, fresh, witty and cerebral (some would also say pedantic). In later films, one has the feeling that Greenaway has try to go back to the style set by Zoo, but the results (like in 8 1/2 women) are almost unwatchable. The plot: two biologists twins working in a zoo, specialized in studying the putrefaction of animals, lose their wives in a car accident. They hook up with a strange woman who lost her leg in that accident. Meanwhile, there are references to Vermeer throughout (what does this has to do with zoology, only Greenaway knows), speeded up shots of real rotting animals, Michael Nyman&apos;s hypnotic score, and also a girl who learns the alphabet through giant letters that are linked with live animals (for example, z is for zebra, as in a children&apos;s book). Deliberately non naturalistic, Greenaway makes from this strange melange a very compelling movie, though undoubtedly very hard to take for some.",

Due to the recent release of penguin movies, a lot of people are turned off by them. Please do not judge it so. I admit, at first I was turned off by it being a penguin movie and I couldn&apos;t think of anything new. Although this type of story has been told before (what story hasn&apos;t?), it&apos;s always interesting to see how it will be presented. And I liked it. The characters and events keep you in the movie. Yes, you&apos;re gonna have to deal with penguins and their habitats, but it won&apos;t be for long. And besides, this is no happy feet, which I liked also. This movie has an amazing cast with enjoyable characters. So be ready to laugh your butt off because I pretty much was. Great family fun movie, or just a movie for you. Now I regret watching it so early (May 20, 2007) because now I have to wait until June 8 to watch it again. = (",

      "reviewBody": "Like many other people, I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel. \n\nTo make a long story short, FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film (particularly at the beginning - but more on that later). Problem was, once I stepped out of the theater, I couldn&apos;t actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen (other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer, that is). It was just so mediocre in terms of plot, direction and acting (somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p), that I didn&apos;t even care enough to remember it. Furthermore, while the original film required some suspension of disbelief, let&apos;s just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far, IMO. \n\nAs I&apos;ve already mentioned, FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner. While Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Alba) get ready for their media circus wedding (think Tomkat style - but bigger), strange electronic and climatic disturbances occur across the globe. From here on out, you have this huge build up that pays off about half an hour into the film, continues with a bang and some dazzling CGI shots, and suddenly ends abruptly while the initial novelty of the Silver Surfer&apos;s appearance wears off. As usual, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm steals the show as the only character to truly evolve during this film, Mike Chiklis as Ben is seriously under-used, my 1.5 year-old nephew could play better than Gruffud&apos;s Reed and Alba isn&apos;t even that pretty anymore. Then you have all these villains (Silver Surfer is definitely not working alone, as implied in the IMDb official plot line) and some twists and turns that leave you feeling mildly entertained, but also incredibly under whelmed. \n\nYou see, if you&apos;re looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn. However, don&apos;t expect to find the heart of Spider-Man 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End. Don&apos;t even look for credible acting or intelligent plot. Only decent thing you&apos;ll find are some good looking money shots, and mindless action sequences. This formula of a film may work well as a matinée, but not as something you&apos;ll want to come back and watch again in the coming future.",

The nuns warn father Don Ameche (as Edward Shelley) and beautiful blonde step-mother Martha Hyer (as Francene) that Ms. Gordon needs tender loving care. Since the young woman inherited everything, her parents seem more interested in getting some money...\n\nAn appropriately melodramatic and cartooning delivery help make this a fun &quot;drive-in&quot;-type horror movie. It also found a re-run home on TV during a time when TV movies of this type enjoyed great popularity. Bert I. Gordon&apos;s &quot;Picture Mommy Dead&quot; probably inspired producers to put more stories like this on their &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; production schedules. Just enjoy the silliness, TV movie style and snazzy score by Robert Drasnin. &quot;The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out, in your stomach and out your mouth,&quot; is a mysterious clue. It&apos;s set in majestic Greystone Mansion. As a bonus, you get to see Zsa Zsa Gabor go up in flames.\n\n****** Picture Mommy Dead (11/2/66) Bert I.

Ziehrer works his way up from being a salesman in his father&apos;s hat-shop to being an internationally recognized composer and conductor. Johann Strass, on the height of fame, is Zieher&apos;s idol and arch-rival. This film was the first colour production of the WIEN FILM  and was shot on location during the time of the worst air raids in 1943/44. The lavish costumes and sets are astonishing and very eye-pleasing. Willy Forst, master of musicals set in old Vienna, directs and plays the title role. He does it with charm, although he really shouldn&apos;t sing. The supporing roles are well cast, especially Hans Moser in the role of Ziehrers devoted companion. Watch out for a very young Curt Jurgens in one of his first appearances in movies. This production was one of the last big budget (Filmoperette)-musicals set in 19th century Vienna. Even all this years it is worth watching and makes a good feature for a Saturday matinee. A must for fans of romantic costume dramas.",

The films strongest point is the storyline which I have to say is highly original and is like I have ever seen before. Well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.",

I&apos;m guessing that these people would cease to exist at all if they didn&apos;t have somebody to hate. What&apos;s worse is that they think they are better than those they hate, yet if you see who they are despite their racist ideals they are still losers. Did they learn nothing from WWII? What&apos;s sadder than all of this is that it&apos;s fine if they poison their own minds w/ignorance, intolerance, not to mention a lack of education it&apos;s that they do it to their own children &amp; other extremely susceptible people. If these people had a little more knowledge about other people and cultures and weren&apos;t so... well let&apos;s say it STUPID &amp; UNEDUCATED they might not be like this. Notice how most of these people don&apos;t have any kind talent. For example the so-called music they make isn&apos;t in the least bit any good. Take away the racist lyrics and there still isn&apos;t any musical ability there. They are a joke in the legitimate industry &amp; it&apos;s not just because of lyrics, it&apos;s because they have the ability of 10 year old kids. Another interesting fact is that there aren&apos;t any Neo-Nazi, Skinheads or whatever they are calling themselves now, that have any sort of secondary education. None of them seem to have a Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate&apos;s degrees. It just goes to prove that basic skinheads are seriously lacking in education which makes them extremely foolish by their one-sided ideas without any real knowledge to back it up. No knowing &quot;Mein-Kampf doesn&apos;t count either. Watch this documentary because it&apos;s interesting, but there are a lot that are interesting about this subject.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen better Buster Keaton short films, but this one still manages to portray the rather dreary fate of a man who finds himself in prison because an escaped convict switched clothes with him after he knocked himself unconscious with a golf ball. His is ultimately to be hung, and I think the film deserves respect for keeping you laughing even while a man gets a noose wrapped around his neck. The story involves Keaton&apos;s efforts to escape from the prison, oppressed at first by the prison guards holding him prisoner and then by a massive behemoth of a convict, who takes control of the small prison by knocking out all of the guards with a sledge hammer (in a rather entertaining sequence where he smacks them all one by one and they pile up like the police cars in Blues Brothers 2000) at right about the same time that Keaton manages to switch clothes with one of them in order to help himself escape. Lots of clever slapstick gags, some of which may have influenced Chaplin&apos;s work in Pay Day, made a couple years later, make this an entertaining short from one of the giants of silent film comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "The strange thing about this movie is that it really is what its title promises -- the story of Desiree, and nothing more. Made in the dark years before the feminist movement, (indeed, in the worst days of the feminine mystique) the film makers seem to assume that the &quot;ideal&quot; woman is warm, impulsive, kittenish, flirtatious and yet non-sexual. Desiree is forever stuck at the end of childhood. She lives through great events but her &quot;womanly&quot; nature makes her ignore everything but her own physical comfort. She is Scarlett O&apos;Hara without the suffering, cruelty or ambition, and Natasha Rostov without the fellow-feeling, patriotism and mystical sympathy for others. It&apos;s odd how you feel enchanted by her, and yet you feel disgusted with yourself for wanting a girl who remains infantile in so many ways. Truly a guilty pleasure.\n\nSome of the things Desiree says in this movie are beyond belief. For example, after she becomes Princess of Sweden, her husband suggests that she needs some tutors, and she cries, &quot;I haven&apos;t learned anything since I was ten!&quot; And like, who is supposed to stand up and cheer? You could be the worst sexist pig in the world and this movie would make you feel like Anna Quindlen.\n\nOr take the scene where the Swedes arrive in the middle of the night and tell Marshall Bernadotte (a superb Michael Rennie) that he is now in line to be King of Sweden. Bernadotte tells Desiree, his wife, to hurry up and get dressed. &quot;Put on anything, you understand?&quot; And she wails, &quot;no, no, I don&apos;t understand anything!&quot; Some other comments have said Jean Simmons is &quot;whining&quot; in this movie. But it&apos;s much worse than that. She&apos;s really pure feminist Kryptonite! The whole point is that men find her irresistible because she always, always, plays dumb and does nothing but bleat about being hungry, tired, or confused.\n\nProblem is, Jean Simmons is just so natural and so attractive that it sort of goes down easy. You really do find yourself wanting to hug her every other scene, if you&apos;re a man anyway. If you&apos;re Anna Quindlen you probably just want to slap her. She&apos;s the feminist anti-Christ.\n\nAt least she&apos;s not a blonde!"

If I didn&apos;t know any better I&apos;d say it still WAS the 70s thanks to the unique atmosphere the movie creates.\n\nCinematography was brilliant. There are many scenes warmly lit with orange sunlight and it is very pleasant on the eye. This made Kirsten Dunst seem even more beautiful than she is. Which is very beautiful indeed.\n\nAnother thing about this movie is that the teen males are mature and behave in a dignified and respectful way. Not like most other teen movie these days when all they do is party, joke about diarrhoea and make love to pastries. That quality in The Virgin Suicides was new and refreshing to me.\n\nI know this film doesn&apos;t have a wide release so see it whenever you get the chance and you&apos;ll end up wishing that more films were made this way.",

But they&apos;re still in love so their friends conspire to get them back together. Lovely songs, including &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris.&quot; Ann Sothern, adorable as always, does her own singing here and she actually has a nice voice. Great cast includes (in addition to Sothern and Young) Eleanor Powell, Red Skelton, Reginald Owen, Lionel Barrymore, and Virginia O&apos;Brien. Powell&apos;s dance number with her dog and &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot; finale are classics. Perhaps a little longer than it needed to be for such a simple story but it doesn&apos;t drag. It&apos;s good fun.",

How can you go wrong with a script by Frank Miller (comic book writer/artist responsible for &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and many years on Marvel&apos;s &quot;Daredevil&quot;) and the director of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back?&quot; In my book, &quot;R2&quot; picks up exactly where the original left off, with more action, better character development, and maintains the sly sense of humor of the first film. Some of the stop-motion special effects look a little aged now (at least on my VHS copy; I haven&apos;t upgraded this one to DVD yet) but if you can get past that &quot;R2&quot; is enjoyable for action freaks."

But the main ornament of this film is the young actress Mila Berlinskaya, which became then the well-known pianist. She was only 13 in 1974. Charming young girl, &quot;Lolita&quot; of Soviet cinema. It is impossible to forget her expressive blue eyes! Now she lives in France. I recommend to look this film. Fantastic soviet space saga! Mila Berlinskaya is very beautiful girl with gentle unusual face. The ideal character for Nabokov&apos;s Lolita. Really stunning movie.",

Well, that&apos;s the way I feel about this film, a real sleeper than few people have ever heard about. When they see it - at least the friends I&apos;ve shown it to - they enjoy it, too. This is an excellent romance story that&apos;s quite different, quite touching and quite haunting. This is one of the few movies that actually cost me some sleep after I first saw it one evening.\n\nThe two main characters are &quot;half-breeds,&quot; Avik (or &quot;Holy Boy&quot;) is an Eskimo- white man and &quot;Albertine,&quot; an Indian-French female. Both are well-played as kids and as adults. The filmmakers did an amazing job finding two kids who really look like the two adults probably would have looked like when they were young and with the same voice inflections and accents.\n\nAs adults Jason Scott Lee and Anne Parillaud are memorable. So is the cinematography, particularly the Dresden bombing scene which is simply jaw- dropping.\n\nWarning: the movie is heart-wrenching at times with not a happy ending, but I think that helps make this film so memorable, so haunting. Even the music is haunting.\n\nThis is a strange, mystical movie. Either it&apos;s going to mean very little to you or it&apos;s going to be something special you&apos;ll want to see a number of times.",

Ummer, Jayabharathi, Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair, Adoor Bhasi and Baby Sumathi in important roles. It won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.The film tells the story of a Hindu man who adopts a Muslim child and allows her to follow Muslim traditions. It reflects light on the religion and God which were both created by man.Sethumadhavan was a prolific filmmaker and in the first two decades of his career, he made more than 50 films. There were times when he used to make five to six films in a year. What made him different from the rest was that amidst this steady flow of work, he intermittently managed to produce some of the finest works in Malayalam cinema.",

      "name": "Not easy viewing but interesting and engaging. Oh, and viewers calling it a &apos;Fatal Attraction rip off&apos; are just missing the point",
      "reviewBody": "Out in the country for a nice picnic, Joe and Claire get involved in a ballooning accident that leads to the death of one of the men who came to help. Joe seems to get over it but he does obsess over whether or not he could have done more. This obsession is fed when he begins being stalked by one of the men who was also involved in the accident  Jed, who appears to believe that Joe and him are close and belong together as a result of what they shared. As Jed continues to get close, Joe appears to be coming apart, putting a great deal of strain on his relationship with Claire.\n\nWhen I went to see this film I had no idea whatsoever what it was about and the first four minutes of the film had as much of an impact on me as I&apos;m told the start of the book did. With the accident (that is frighteningly convincing) the seeds are sown for a film that is about love, mental health and about a sort of Fatal Attraction vibe. I use the last description with reservations because I don&apos;t think this is comparable to Fatal Attraction because this has so much more to it than just the bunny boiler stuff. Instead the story mixes it with Joe&apos;s own sanity crumbling at the same time as Claire&apos;s &apos;enduring love&apos; for him is put to the test. I have not read the book, but for my money the film did this pretty well, producing plenty of good dialogue that meant the film was more about the character of Joe than it was about Jed. This is not say it is totally perfect because it isn&apos;t; the fatal attraction thing easily takes the focus meaning that some parts of the audience may feel that this is the whole ball game and that all the &apos;talking&apos; is what gets in the way. For me, I felt the other way, the fatal attraction thing weakened the film when it is the focus and, for this reason, I didn&apos;t like the extra ending during the credits because I felt that the open ending had done fine on its own.\n\nThe writing is good but the film relies very heavily on the performances and, luckily they are all good where they need to be. Craig is fast becoming someone who is headed for big things, not only does he have the body of a star but he can really act too. Here he is a convincing &apos;normal&apos; person and his initial polite bemusement by Jed is realistic, as his gradual descent into instability himself. Morton may have less time but she is equally convincing and realistic in showing that love always has limits everywhere except in the movies. Ifans is good even though he has the roles of the religious fanatic, mentally ill, homosexual stalker to deal with. Whether or not it was wise to link all those aspects or not is one matter but Ifans still does well  never really resorting to showboating or easy &apos;mad man&apos; stuff. I wasn&apos;t totally won over by him because Craig was my focus, but he still did well. Support from Nighy, Lynch etc is OK but really they are minor roles and not anywhere near the centre of the film.\n\nOverall this is a strange film and anyone who dismisses it as being a rip off of Fatal Attraction has totally missed the point. Instead the film looks at love, at sanity and relationship all in a well-written script that is well delivered by a couple of very good actors in the lead roles. Not to everyone&apos;s tastes then and not the easiest one to really put into a nutshell but interesting, moving and satisfyingly lacking in gloss throughout."

It was that great. A true representation of relationships, what guys and girls are looking for and a true replica of the men I have dated in the past. It made me wonder why I was asking the guy I have been with for 4 years for a commitment. I like to think I walked away from this film with a few more laughs and some good insight on what it is guys want or think they want! The cast was inspiring and a fun look at where some of them were just 4 years ago and how far they have come. I wish there was some more movies that made me laugh and think out loud.",

      "reviewBody": "Scrapbooking, a hobby that has increased in popularity in recent years, is, according to Wikipedia, &apos;a method for preserving a legacy of written history in the form of photographs, printed media, and memorabilia contained in decorated albums&apos;. In Scrapbook, a low budget indie horror from director Eric Stanze, serial-killer Leonard (Tommy Biondo) blends polaroids, news cuttings and handwritten journals from his victims to produce a detailed account of his career as a killer: a scrapbook twelve years in the making and a labour of love which he hopes will one day make him famous.\n\nLeonard has only one more victim to document until his project is complete: Clara (Emily Haack), a chubby bird with a very bad haircut. He subjects her to days upon days of degradation, rape and violence, whilst forcing her to add her comments to his sick journal. But Clara plans to survive her ordeal, and plays mind games with her captor, until, one day, she turns the tables on him and wreaks revenge.\n\nNow I&apos;ve watched a fair amount of &apos;underground&apos; horror in my time, and witnessed all sorts of celluloid depravity, but in my opinion Stanze&apos;s Scrapbook goes just that bit further than most in an effort to shock. A nasty, misogynistic catalogue of torture, it seems that this movie&apos;s purpose is to offend, and in that it definitely succeeds. Use it as a yardstick to measure your tolerance to disturbing imagery, but don&apos;t ever call it art.\n\nBiondo spends 95 minutes abusing Haack&apos;s character in every manner possible, with no detail spared by Stanze&apos;s camera. Haack, an &apos;actress&apos; with obviously no shame, willingly degrades herself at every opportunity; exactly what makes someone want to perform such acts on film, I shall never know.\n\nI tried to view this film as an intense study of psychotic behaviour (ala Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), but Biondi&apos;s Leonard is so OTT, he is hard to take seriously. I tried to view it as a hard-edged &apos;rape/revenge&apos; movie, in which the viewers sense of satisfaction at witnessing the victim&apos;s ultimate retribution justifies earlier scenes of violence—but the payoff is too weak to qualify it as such. And its story and level of acting is not good enough to make it a truly gripping tale about survival against the odds. In the end, I accepted it for what it really is: an effectively repugnant little movie designed purely to illicit a reaction—good or bad—from those who watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "THE BIG HOUSE - prison of no hope - the last terminal for lost souls. Only the strong survive; the weak crack or are corrupted. As the warden shrewdly tells a new arrival, the place won&apos;t make you go yellow, but it you already are yellow it&apos;ll bring it out.\n\nMGM was the only studio in Hollywood which would have let a female write the script for such a strong story. But in Frances Marion they not only had the most celebrated screenwriter in the industry, but also a person uniquely qualified to write about any situation. She headed off to California&apos;s notorious San Quentin Prison to observe the conditions &amp; learn the lingo. Cheerfully deflecting the jibes &amp; taunts of guards &amp; prisoners alike, she reminded them that after being a frontline correspondent in the Great War there were few situations she couldn&apos;t handle.\n\nThe result is a wonderful film, tough, hard-bitten &amp; stark. MGM did itself proud by supplying a terrific cast and production values. The scene where belligerent Wallace Beery refuses to eat the commissary slop remains a classic.\n\nChester Morris does a fine job as a resourceful crook who is actually helped by his time in prison, reformed against his will. This excellent actor is too often ignored when the histories of 1930&apos;s cinema are written. Wallace Beery, as murderous Butch, is absolutely unforgettable. Marion wrote the part with him in mind &amp; it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing it. Lovable &amp; dangerous in equal measure, he steals every scene he&apos;s in. THE BIG HOUSE would set Beery firmly on the road to major talkie stardom.\n\nRobert Montgomery, on the cusp of his own salad days as a sophisticated, romantic leading man, here plays quite a different role. As a weak, cowardly stool pigeon, he&apos;s cast very much against type. It would be 1937&apos;s NIGHT MUST FALL before he received another such finely-nuanced role.\n\nLewis Stone is very effective in the small role as the tough-as-nails warden. Beautiful Leila Hyams is well-cast as Mongomery&apos;s spunky sister. George F. Marion &amp; DeWitt Jennings are both memorable as elderly security guards. Champion stutterer Roscoe Ates provides a few moments of much needed comic relief.\n\nKarl Dane is easily spotted as a hulking convict in several scenes, but he is curiously mute. Doubtless, his thick Danish accent was already giving the Studio trouble. Even though he had been an important comic star in silent pictures, he was quickly relegated to talkie bit parts. He was eventually further reduced to selling hot dogs from a cart outside the MGM front gates. This was the final indignity. He committed suicide in 1934.\n\nPreview audiences were curiously cool to THE BIG HOUSE, until MGM executive Irving Thalberg figured out that female viewers didn&apos;t like con Chester Morris romancing another prisoner&apos;s wife. Thalberg instructed Marion to rewrite a few scenes and refilming made it clear that Leila Hyams was Robert Montgomery&apos;s sister, not his spouse. This pleased the patrons and the movie was a big hit.",

      "name": "The moral hangover of a little French village at the aftermath of World War 2...",
      "reviewBody": "Through &quot;Uranus&quot;, director Claude Berri serves us on a silver platter French cinema crème de la crème: veterans Jean-Pierre Marielle, Philippe Noiret and Michel Galabru followed by Michel Blanc, Gerard Depardieu and Fabrice Luchini and a casting masterstroke with former TV comedian Daniel Prevost as Rochard the schmuck that started it all.\n\nThere are no heroes in that story, but just average men shining through their actions, reaction and at times, inaction... and I was surprised at the end to be able to feel the angst, torment, frustration, disillusion of each one of them as if they were protagonists, in fact as if I lived by their side during the Occupation whose aftermath is the backdrop of &quot;Uranus&quot;. This is the uncompromising tale of men governed by their instincts, principles, fears, pettiness, greed, so many human elements that make the dichotomy of fear vs. Courage too simplistic to analyze what truly happened under Vichy government.\n\nOne shouldn&apos;t underestimate the complexity of the issue and its existential bearing on the national conscience. Basically, there were choices for French people who were not Jews: they could cooperate or even fight with the enemy, some women only had the misfortune to fall in love with German soldiers -which was deemed as horizontal collaboration. Or they could follow the call of General De Gaulle and join the &apos;maquis&apos; to fight and sabotage the German&apos;s equipments and execute collaborators. And neither resistants or collaborators, the silent majority just &apos;let it go&apos; like the Parisians who acclaimed Petain in April 1944 and then De Gaulle in August after the Liberation.\n\n&quot;Uranus&quot; was written by Marcel Ayme who had shady occupations during that bleak era of the same name. And like in &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;, it raises one important catalysis of that National shift: Communism. In Marcel Ophuls&apos; documentary, a former militian admitted he fought with the Nazis because he couldn&apos;t side with Bolcheviks. The anti-Communist sentiment was so prevalent that it gave the party an aura of nobility at the end, it was at the right side of the fight and in that small town where the film takes place: the rising party is represented by three men: Rochard, a petty railroad worker, Jourdan (Luchini), a virulent teacher and faux-intellectual and Gaigneux (Blanc), a more modest but principled father.\n\nThese men couldn&apos;t have been more different, Rochard is an insecure man who spread rumors against local bartender Leopold (Depardieu) after one humiliation too many. He tells everyone that notorious collaborator Maxime Loin (Gérard Desarthe) is kept in his house. By the time he made amends it was too late, the party couldn&apos;t consent to ignore the incident or fire Rochard, Leopold had to be guilty. Jourdan is seen as a little mama&apos;s boy who reasons in terms of group and class while he never lived himself like a true working-man, as his colleague Watrin (Noiret) says &quot;you&apos;re not gifted for life&quot;. Jourdan is the brain without the muscle, the thinker without the guts, diametrically opposed to Gaigneux disapproves constantly, neighbor of the Archambauds, the bourgeois family who happens to hide Loin.\n\nThe seemingly straitlaced father Archambaud (Marielle) is portrayed in a rather weird establishing moment, instead of disapproving his daughter (Florence Darel) for frolicking around with the son Monglat, he warns her against getting pregnant, but being the mistress or wife of a rich kid amount to the same. This shows the concussion left by the war, when the notions of morality were turned upside down. When Archambaud finds Loin, tracked like a dog, he can&apos;t resign himself to leave him for a certain death. He shelters him, makes him sleep with his son (not his daughter) and asks neighbor Watrin if he can use his bed as well. Loin was a ruthless collaborator but oddly enough, Archambaud&apos;s act seems if not heroic but brave.\n\nIn fact these little villages are totally remote from the usual narrative of &quot;barbarity rid by WW2&quot;, that Communists are influent makes no difference than the Occupation and in a sort of twist of irony, the former collaborators became the &apos;resistants&apos;. Everything is a lie in this world, even Leopold who claims to have been a resistant is reminded by the Police that his business worked with the Germans and the Jew he so-called kept was his nephew. In his mind &quot;Leppold has nothing to blame himself for, he made money but still less than Monglat Se. (Galabru). As Leopold, Depardieu gives a boisterous and exuberant performance as if he was still channelling Cyrano De Bergerac, he plays a men who needs wine and words to fulfill his thirst and finds himself a new talent, to compose verses and alexandrines.\n\nIn this labyrinthine plot where stories overlap with a remarkable fluidness, Leopold and Watrin are the two men trying to escape from that dim reality, Leopold with self-destruction and creation (maybe echoing Ayme&apos;s mindset) while Wautrin tries to see good in everything and doesn&apos;t exhaust in mind in analyzing what goes beyond his power. He explains though that every night at 11;15, he thinks of that last page he was reading in an astronomy book, about the dark and cold Uranus, and keeps repeating the words he read when the bombs killed her wife who was in the factor&apos;s arms. Basically, &quot;Uranus&quot; is the mental state of a town that still live in total moral rumble, where men became so emasculated their women would gave themselves to the first stranger.\n\nIt&apos;s not ultimately surprising that Mrs. Archambaud (Daniele Lebrun) has an affair with Loin, who&apos;s in a position to judge anyone in such a context... it&apos;s a sort of matter-of-factly cynicism that remains truthful about human nature and Berri doesn&apos;t lecture these men, but the human nature in general, and the way it can express itself during exceptional circumstances... showing that there&apos;s a moment where bravery and cowardice are so banal they almost become interchangeable.",

      "reviewBody": "Surprisingly, for the type of dialog driven movie that this was it was pretty good. I think it was mainly a movie about the human psyche and how it can screw with people hardcore sometimes and screw up good things (relationships). This is also very accurate in portraying how someone with anxiety might feel and act after a very hard breakup. Not everyone will be able to relate to the guys actions here or may think it is because he&apos;s a druggie, but I think this movie is more about anxiety. When he is seemingly going nuts (around the time talking to the shrink)it was very realistic of the helpless feeling someone with panic attacks will have.\n\nAlmost every conversation, mood and situation in this movie I can relate to, and have been in before. I&apos;ve had the same conversation with a few ex girlfriends when they were trying to push religion on me. So I don&apos;t think the dialog was trying to be too pretentious or philosophical at all. It was just portraying the stupid things people argue about that someone may have been very caught up in during the passion of the moment, but then thinking back to them they seem very stupid to fight about.",

Its also a nice show to watch with your kids if your an adult with kids because even as an adult who had even grown up with Winnie the Pooh it still entertains you. I love the stories. There like any other sitcom. You can try to figure out whats going to happen to Piglet or something. There not like those new garbage Nickalodean cartoons like Spongebob or Jimmy Neutron, they are entertaining. I also like the background music they have for the show. I don&apos;t know what it is, I just like it. My favorite character is Rabbit. His relationship with Tigger reminds me of Ralph&apos;s relationship with Norton on The Honeymooners. Very goofy and you just want to see that scene where Rabbit gets mad at Tigger. This the best of Winnie and the whole gang. Buy the tapes for your kids."

The creators made the wise choice of choosing the best actors from the series to focus the story on. Especially the first half is very funny - lots of jokes. Characters are well drawn - except for the bad guy, who is poorly cast. Kids will certainly enjoy the movie if they watch the series, but Parents who come along will probably not complain.

      "reviewBody": "As someone pointed out, it is a simple summer romance story, a college boy goes to a rural area (uncle&apos;s farm), where he falls in love with a girl. And to put spoke in their path are girl&apos;s guardians (boy&apos;s uncle is almost encouraging), and the various orthodox people, including the village Priest.\n\nThe web tells this movie was roundly condemned and even banned for nudity and anti-religious portrayal.\n\nThe nudity aspect is, at least on today&apos;s age, less than negligible, and anyway it isn&apos;t for the purpose what today&apos;s nudity, including exposures by &apos;A&apos; rated actors, are meant to (titilation), so that aspect, if any one tries to watch it for, is going to be disappointed.\n\nThe other aspect, probably what gave rise to its allround condemnation (compounded by the nudity) was its portrayal of Church/ Clergy in negative light and making the Priest as the Villain of the story.\n\nThis on surface seems to be merited, but isn&apos;t really. Though one must note that in all the major accidents in the movie, the Priest was involved. But it would be wrong to say that he deliberately engineered them.\n\nHere the clash was between, Freedom and Bondage. The right to live and love is freedom. Love need not necessarily be sin, as one of the protagonists mentions. The aspect of morality IMHO makes the difference - heart and flesh. The Bondage on the life is put by Religion - and in fact not really by it, but by the orthodox and pedagogical misinterpretations, which really the movie tried to depict. These misinterpretations - the pedagogical part, is due to the Priest (and in fact in real life many of them) didn&apos;t understand the underlying message and took it by word values, and the orthodoxy comes many times due to the complexity of the persons (the cousin who is slowly crossing the age) or the aunt (probably due to the child-lessness?) and as a result, not only the sermons are wrongly delivered, but also wrongly interpreted (which led to barn burning, despite the Priest never intended anything like that to happen, the &apos;fire and damnation&apos; in the mind of the mentally challenged disciple led to that). The movie still provokes thoughts even in today&apos;s society, since the orthodoxy and bonds put by various widely misinterpreted religions are still there and are still making sins of virtue, victims of innocents., even condoning murders (e.g. case of Dr. Savita Halappanavar - death or murder ?) - the defense logic is always the same, as in this movie, some times harsh decisions are taken by Him, or examples made of, so that the flock don&apos;t stray - only the question remains, was that decision by Him, or his mis-ministers ?",

      "reviewBody": "The stiff upper lip and jaw of Ralph Bates finally come into their own in this nice variation of Jekyll and Hyde, which also mixes in good quantities of Jack the Ripper myth and the famous 17th century grave robbers Burke and Hare. Considerably less stiff is Martine Beswick as the doctor&apos;s female alter ego. She is absolutely too loose in her ways, but I am certainly not complaining! Both are just the right persons for their clashing roles and superbly so. The actual physical change between the two supreme parts in one person is shown in subtle manners and without great special effects, which not only was cheaper to do, but also leaves a lot for a viewer to imagine and so makes it in a way easier to accept. A wise decision from the makers.\n\nThe plot idea of unifying the two main story lines of such classic origins is nothing short of brilliant. The invention of elixir of human life using female hormones and how to get it by &quot;uncanny goings in late hours&quot; really does the trick. So does the fascinating and at the same time foul results of the experiment, the mixing of selves and struggle for dominance. Of course much more could have been built in and deepened in the script making the story more intriguing and disturbing. Some needed romantic and freshening humor aspect comes from the continuously snooping neighbors with their funnily pretentious &quot;it doesn&apos;t concern us&quot; attitude.\n\nIn all, this is once again a fun and stylish horror movie from Hammer studios. The bolder style of company&apos;s early seventies film is very much present with some slight gore and nudity added in the proceedings. So, now everyone hurry up and see it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the sweetest film. It&apos;s definitely a &apos;chick thing&apos; with Manny and Lo and Elaine bonding around an infant to be (Lo&apos;s). No men are allowed in this paradise. One appears and he gets bopped over the head, gagged and hog-tied. This is a fem-family made on the run. Lo (Aleska Palladino) in her high teens runs away from a foster home with her younger sister, Manny (Scarlett Johansson). It&apos;s a Thelma and Louise crime spree made as a movie for children. Well, not quite. Turns out Lo&apos;s pregnant. She has been hiding this from 11-year-old Manny, who has the eye of Sherlock Holmes and is the brains of this team. They find a rather nice, used only during the ski season cabin in the woods and hole up to await the stork. They spot Elaine (Mary Kay Place), a lonely spinster working in a baby clothes shop and kidnap her to help deliver the baby. Everybody, despite gruff exteriors, has a heart of gold, and togetherness and loving concern prevail.\n\nAnd what&apos;s wrong with that?\n\nNothing really. But I was thinking: this is the obverse of male war movies where none or few women appear, men doing their manly thing killing one another, women irrelevant. I think that&apos;s the key word here for director Lisa Kruege: in the reproductive game that is war by other means, men are irrelevant. Or almost so. In war it doesn&apos;t matter how many men are killed. As long as there are some left the population will quickly spring back. Kill the women, though, and you have a serious population problem. Manny and Lo and Elaine prove that you really don&apos;t need the male: his sperm will do, and that way you don&apos;t have to put up with his loutish behavior.\n\nI think I got this right. Anyway, it&apos;s a cute movie.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

The idea of a bunch of teenagers setting out to all commit suicide on camera is somewhat silly, but hearing their observations of the world today and seeing how everything spins out of control was just indescribable. This film was disturbing and surreal, but it was great. It literally made my heart ache.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for some romantic comedy or cliché drama, then this is not the movie for you.

      "reviewBody": "First off let&apos;s take a moment to talk about the criticism of Kazan&apos;s actions during the blacklist and get that out of the way. Kazan is considered by the top directors in the world to be the best of all of them for good reason, but no discussion of Kazan can leave out some issues arising from the the HUAC -- and the cultural context. Let me just say that as a lifelong fan of Peter Greenaway I made it a point to see the premier of his &quot;Eisenstein in Guanajuato&quot; (Greenway has an upcoming &quot;Eisenstein in Hollywood&quot; as well). It is interesting that one of the actors I saw gushing to the press about that film and Eisenstein in general, was one of the nastiest critics of Kazan getting the honorary Oscar in 1999. Excuse me, but Kazan named 8 names -- of Stalin lovers like Trumbo when Stalin aficionados were were no different than Nazis -- while Eisenstein fawned over Stalin, worked directly with the KGB and its predecessor organ, and betrayed moderate socialists and communists and got them KILLED. Eisenstein was a great director -- AND an active participant in murder of dissidents, as well as jailing and torture off artists in the USSR -- quite of few of whom he secretly denounced to the KGBd knowing they would not be blacklisted - but subject to violence, imprisonment and often death. From the Soviet archives released after 1999 brouhaha with Kazan, we now know for a fact that two of the people Kazan named were in fact direct soviet agents, not just people who went to a meeting or two, but people who were collecting blackmail against others for the benefit of the KGB and directly working with the KGB. Kazan harmed the career path of people who were stalinists. What he did was no different than than &quot;doxing&quot;/naming Nazis. What Eisenstein did was hlp the KGB murder people, yet Eisenstein&apos;s participation in politics of totalitarianism is never fully told.\n\nSo let&apos;s face facts. There is a clear double standard. Modern Hollywood celebrates artists who adored Stalin, and quite a few who directly worked for that evil apparatus vs and people like Kazan, whose sins, if they were even sins, were trivial in comparison.\n\nAs to the rest of this film, Scorsese acknowledgement of the influence and inspiration of Kazan is instructive and inspirational for all film lovers. Scorsese touches on the dual incredible sensitive of Kazan as an artist, creator, and his incredible understanding and portrayal of the human condition combined with his perseverance that allowed him to survive. One hour is a very short time to cover Kazan&apos;s accomplishments. I suggest Kazan&apos;s own award winning and brutally honest autobiography, but Scorsese&apos;s love letter is a good start."

Linda Darnell does well in playing a version of herself and we wouldn&apos;t see anything like it again until MGM starred Mario Lanza in That Midnight Kiss.\n\nYoung Linda plays a would be hopeful who shares a connection with her discoverer. Former comic actor Roland Young now a talent scout for the studio that is headed by William Gargan. Darnell shares a connection to Young through her late mother and he takes a fatherly interest in her career even though at first he tries to discourage her from ever thinking about a show business career. \n\nIn that he has a rivalry with another studio executive Donald Meek who is marvelous as a typical &apos;yes&apos; man. He&apos;s got an interest himself in Mary Beth Hughes that&apos;s a more prurient interest and he&apos;ll damage Darnell to promote Hughes.\n\nJohn Payne is also on hand as an All American football player who is another of Young&apos;s discoveries. His character is without a doubt based on Johnny Mack Brown who tore up the playing fields for the Crimson Tide of Alabama before coming to Hollywood. Payne gets an opportunity to sing one forgettable song in Star Dust. Singing the title song is yet another of Young&apos;s discoveries Mary Healy who is helped along by studio drama coach Charlotte Greenwood.\n\nThough Payne and Darnell are the leads and the film is based somewhat on Darnell&apos;s own story the film is really driven by the rivalry between Young and Meek. Star Dust shows both its young leads off to good advantage and Darnell&apos;s place in Hollywood was certainly secure.",

The whole idea of everyone over 35 being killed by a gas that didn&apos;t work on the younger population was a wild idea to begin with, but the surrealism of this movie even made it wilder to look at. Too bad that Corman&apos;s last film for A.I.P. couldn&apos;t have been a schlock classic like many of his earlier. At least on the bright side we get to look at a very young Cindy Williams, Talia Shire and Ben Vereen in what was one of, if not their first roles in a motion picture."

      "reviewBody": "1980. Aircraft carrier USS Nimitz is on a routine voyage off the coast of Hawaii when she travels through a strange storm. Upon clearing the storm she encounters some strange occurrences, all of which suggest she has travelled back in time in 1941. Moreover, it is 6 December 1941 and the Nimitz is in a position to prevent the disastrous outcome of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nI has low expectations for this film. The whole idea just seemed silly and merely a vehicle for that schoolboy fantasy of modern jet fighters taking on WW2 planes. However, it is far better than that.\n\nWriters and director set the scene well. We see the everyday operation of an aircraft carrier, the different parts and people in the organisation and, of course, the machinery of war. Makes for interesting viewing, so much so that even if there was no plot the video footage could be used as a documentary.\n\nThe plot development is handled well too, to the point that the whole time-travel concept even becomes plausible. It is handled quite well, even touching on the implications of changing history.\n\nAfter this great set up, the conclusion is a bit disappointing, being fairly low-key as the movie sort of fizzles out. The changing history scenario isn&apos;t fully explored and you feel that the writers missed a few opportunities to create a powerful ending.\n\nStill, quite entertaining, especially if you like to see military aircraft in action and the workings of an aircraft carrier.",

      "reviewBody": "There are different strokes to appreciate The Silence.\n\nThe first is the theological/existential perspective. Contrary to many published reviews on the trilogy, I find the three films affirm the existence of God in the face of doubt. What is the silence referring to? God appears to be quiet; yet the ailing Ester communicates with her nephew by providing him a piece of paper with a foreign word &quot;hadjek&quot; that means &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. Is that a word that a woman disillusioned with existence of God would pass on to her nephew on her deathbed? I have doubts about Bergman&apos;s professed agnosticism. &quot;Hadjek&quot; is the last word of The Silence spoken by Johan reading from the list of foreign words from Ester&apos;s letter to him that he jealously guards from his own mother Anna. Somewhat like &quot;rosebud&quot; in Citizen Kane. Again there are two shots towards the end of The Silence that offer Christian symbolism affirming faith in God. First, there is the last shot of Ester her face directed at light from the window, fully exposed to light, as she waits for her eventual death, content at having passed on the letter to her nephew. The second is the last shot of Anna her bathing her face in rainwater (a symbol of baptism) having read the contents of the letter that Johan holds in his hands. \n\nNow Bergman gave names to his film&apos;s characters with considerable thought, incorporating Biblical connections that he probably picked up from his father&apos;s sermons. The priest Tomas in Winter Light is so named because St Thomas doubted the resurrection of Christ, just as Tomas is questioning the existence of God. Ester in The Silence is obviously named after the Biblical book Esther, one of the only two books in the Bible that does not mention God directly. Does the absence of God mean the book is not holy? By corollary, does the silence of God mean that God does not exist? For the atheist viewer of The Silence, too, there is sufficient room to record the director&apos;s observation of deserted churcheswhen Anna truthfully confesses to her elder sister that she had sex with a waiter in an empty church. For the existentialist viewer, there is silence from God to the cries of help from Ester. Yet another way to appreciate The Silence is to study the physical silence in the film. Spoken words are indeed few. The film begins with the tick-tock of a watch/clock, which stops when the characters break their silence. The watch is also a metaphor for the limited time of life on earth available for each individual. The sound of the tick-tock increases when Ester is unable to breath and is mortally afraid of dying from suffocation. It is also heard when Anna is reflecting on her post-coital satisfaction in her hotel room. Words are fewthe foreign words learnt in the unnamed country relate to &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;face&quot; and finally &quot;soul&quot;. Much of the visual communication relates to &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;faces&quot;, particularly those of Ester. Ester&apos;s hands move even when she is sleeping. Ester&apos;s hand caresses Anna&apos;s hair but stops short of touching the face. The denizens of the unnamed country hardly speak, yet we know all is not well, with tanks moving in the night and underfed horses pulling carts of furniture to nowhere. Death seems around the corner. One of the few other sounds we hear is the click of the toy gun, disturbing the cleaner of the chandelier. Then there is the clank of the tank negotiating the narrow street outside the hotel. More importantly, silence in the film between individual characters in the film, existing side by side with the theological silence.\n\nA third way to evaluate complex issues of The Silence is to study the camera-work of Sven Nykvist. Much of the brilliance of the black-and-white film revolves around shadows and light, mirrors and last but not the least, close-ups. The carnal events are captured in shadows, while epiphanies are swathed in bright light. Nykvist and Bergman use mirrors to indicate the lack of direct communication or rather the presence of bounced communication. When Ester, the translator of languages cannot converse with the maitre d&apos;hotel, she resorts to sign languageeven the boy Johan prefers Punch and Judy to communicate his feelings rather than read a book for his sick aunt. The extraordinary performance of one of cinema&apos;s finest actresses, Ingrid Thulin, would have been difficult to perceive were it not for Nykvist&apos;s close-ups of her face and hands.\n\nA fourth way to approach The Silence is the character of the young boy Johan, who probably is the personification of the young Bergman. Johan is a mix of irreverence (he urinates in the hotel corridor) and innocence (he willingly cross-dresses at the behest of the dwarfs). He is attached to his mother, but respects his aunt even more. As the film un-spools, it is evident that he obeys his mother but is able to connect with the aunt&apos;s higher level of intellect, quite aware that she is dying. Johan&apos;s father exists but is not physically present. Johan is figuratively squeezed between his mother lacking a &quot;conscience&quot; and an aunt with a domineering and an implied lesbian relationship with his own mother. It is not a perfect life for a boy. Indirectly, Bergman wants the viewer to step into Johan&apos;s shoes, irreverent yet innocent and loving. Johan is first introduced to death by the personal collection of family photographs of the maitre d&apos;hotel, including photographs of his dead wife. But John prefers to hide them beneath the carpet but resurrects the subject in his own Punch and Judy show for his aunt.\n\nThen you can look at The Silence as the quintessential Ingrid Thulin film. In The Silence her facial expressions are the very imprints one associates with Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s thespian turns in cinema. It is no wonder that she acted in films of topnotch directors: Bergman, Visconti, Resnais and Minnelli.",

It is set in 1930s and at a time when such effective slavery was prevalent - the boy&apos;s father effectively sells him to another miner for 500 lira (death warranty). The film is raw and thanks to some excellent acting on the boy&apos;s part very realistic as he faces what appears to be the accepted mores of the time where boys were used not only as slave workers but also as sex objects for older miners from Monday to Saturday. I do not believe you can watch the film and not be seriously moved - particularly as there are likely modern day similar scenarios where boys and young men are exploited away from the prying sight of media - though no longer in Europe. A salutary reminder of what can happen particularly where indigent families are effectively forced to sell children.",

As a whole, the movie works great with a mix of quick frights and as a screechingly, effective head trip. The acting is great and it&apos;s a guilty pleasure watching people becoming gradually trapped in Tomie&apos;s quagmire of madness. Just watch Takeshi who shines in any scene at his apartment. Kudos to Sayaka Yamaguchi for her portrayal of Yumi who is one tough cookie (she screams well, straight from the diaphragm!). Note how characters&apos; mental breakdowns range from hushed, vacant tones to high pitched shrieks of insanity. This does well at keeping the story not wholly predictable. There is a &apos;Tell-Tale Heart&apos; syndrome in the story where you wonder if it&apos;s the guilty conscience at work or Tomie herself (or BOTH!!).\n\nThe spooky soundtrack and sound effects are key. One scene, there will be birds chirping in the countryside suddenly interrupted by breaking glass, loud moans, or a hacksaw cutting away. Some of the scenes look amazing (one reason for my enjoyment of foreign films). This includes Yumi&apos;s home with a wooden finish overlooking the city, the bus ride with a cliffside view, and an ominous staircase.\n\nTomie: Replay&apos;s definitely my favorite out of the series.",

The movie focuses on the identity crisis of a trans person, but then it shows you that the identity crisis, often isn&apos;t coming from the person themselves (they&apos;re actually pretty sure of what gender they belong to) but its the world who has the real crisis, the people around you, friends, family who are supposed to support you. The way the main character keeps fighting to find his place, it was heartbreaking and just really touching. We see the transformation too, and its just brilliant. I was completely amazed.",

In fact, Warren Beatty and the two guys chasing him must have been Olympic marathon runners to keep up that pace for so long, racing through Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThis is a mixture of lighthearted and gritty material about an international robbery.\n\nJoining Beatty (&quot;Joe Collins&quot;) in the hijinks is a young Goldie Hawn (&quot;Dawn Divine&quot;) and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; of James Bond fame, Gerte Frobe. Scott Brady and Robert Webber also give shorter-but- memorable performances. In all, entertaining but not real heavy in the brains department.\n\nNice to see this has finally been issued on DVD, and has a nice transfer.",

      "reviewBody": "After his brother&apos;s apparent suicide a young man by the name of &quot;Frank Reade&quot; (Michael O&apos;Keefe) returns to his old home town to attend the funeral. Although he doesn&apos;t get along well with his father &quot;Nat Reade&quot; (John Seitz) he stops by the tannery where he works as a courteous gesture but is rebuffed for it all the same. That being said, the next person he visits is a night club owner named &quot;Drew Smith&quot; (Al Shannon) to try to find some answers as to why his brother killed himself. Not satisfied he then goes back to his younger brother&apos;s mobile home and gets some sleep. Immediately after the funeral the next day he is picked up by the police where he is given his brother&apos;s personal effects by &quot;Sheriff Bill Neff&quot; (John O&apos;Keefe) but is once again dissatisfied with the reasons for his brother&apos;s suicide. Things change, however, when he meets his brother&apos;s girlfriend &quot;Jo&quot; (Bridget Fonda) who seems to have acquired an immediate fondness for him for reasons he doesn&apos;t quite understand. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather mundane mystery-drama which didn&apos;t quite have the passion or suspense necessary for a film of this type. In addition to that, I didn&apos;t particularly care for the performance of Bridget Fonda who played her part in a less than convincing manner as well. In any case, while this wasn&apos;t necessarily a bad film by any means, it wasn&apos;t anything special and I have rated it accordingly.",

Astrid Lindgren has really written one of the most beautiful children&apos;s books in the literature history and all the Swedish Pippi Longstocking movies are absolutely awesome. Georg Riedel has also written a memorable and wonderful title song.",

      "reviewBody": "Styrmand Karlsen is a comedic adventure filled with good songs and cheerful moments, but its enjoyment is marred by several offensive scenes, such as blackface, that do not hold up well in today&apos;s context. While the film features talented actors and showcases their abilities, there are better comedies in their filmography that deserve more attention.\n\nThe story follows retired Captain Hammer (Johannes Meyer), who is hired by shipowner J. C. Lemborg (Emil Hass Christensen) to sail the &quot;Høegh Belle,&quot; one of his ships, to an island off the coast of Africa where Hammer had run aground ten years earlier. He had brought back a stone that turned out to contain uranium. Hammer recruits Knud Karlsen (Frits Helmuth) as the first mate, Bøgelund (Dirch Passer) as the ship&apos;s cook, and Olsen (Ove Sprogøe) as the sailor. Lemborg&apos;s unruly son, Robert (Ebbe Langberg), is also sent on the journey. Robert had been involved with Karlsen&apos;s girlfriend, Anne Marie Bøgelund (Ghita Nørby), resulting in consequences. The spoiled Robert faces a tough time onboard, and when Karlsen learns that Robert is the father of Anne Marie&apos;s child, a confrontation ensues.\n\nWhile Styrmand Karlsen offers a lively and adventurous experience, it falls short due to the inclusion of offensive scenes, notably the blackface portrayal. These scenes not only detract from the film&apos;s ability to be enjoyed but also undermine its overall quality. It is essential to acknowledge and address these problematic aspects, particularly in light of their harmful implications.\n\nThat being said, the film does have its merits. The three leads, Dirch Passer, Ove Sprogøe, and Ghita Nørby, are talented actors who have delivered excellent performances in numerous other films. Their presence brings a certain level of charm and wit to the screen, elevating the comedic moments and adding depth to their characters.\n\nThe film&apos;s plot takes the characters on a journey to &quot;Pearl Island,&quot; where they encounter Queen Victoria (Clara Østø) and engage in amusing interactions. Styrmand Karlsen finds himself falling for the lovely Princess Bibiana (Tove Wisborg), adding a touch of romance to the storyline. The film incorporates catchy songs and showcases the actors&apos; musical talents, providing enjoyable moments throughout.\n\nHowever, Styrmand Karlsen ultimately receives a mediocre rating of 5 out of 10 stars due to its offensive scenes that undermine its potential. While it offers some entertainment value and showcases the talents of its cast, there are better comedies featuring the same actors that deserve a closer look.",

And the ending is just flipping crazy, going from action, suspense, comedy and then bizarre tragedy. I shouldn&apos;t like it and the humor is sophomoric, but it is maybe the most Miike-esque part of all. plus dramatically it&apos;s always well directed, confidence of someone not a director of only a few films as he was up till this point",

The battle scenes are intense and brutal, even more so then Spielberg&apos;s classic film (which is a movie i really like, too.) They also kick in at unexpected places. They are sitting around eating and suddenly bombs are exploding and limbs are flying. The acting is incredible and emotional even though i watched it in subtitles (dubbed English voices are horrible). The facial expressions said it all. The story is a heartbreaking tale of two brothers who are drafted into the Korean conflict in 1950. By the end, i came this close to tearing up. And i am a tough guy. Or so i think.\n\nNow i know a lot of people in America tend to overlook foreign movies because their afraid of reading, or can&apos;t read, but i am finding more and more that foreign flicks are a lot better than recent Hollywood movies. Hollywood needs to take a lesson and make more creative stories.\n\nThis is truly a masterpiece of modern cinema, a milestone in war movies, and one of the best films i have seen in a long time.

Adding to the mix and a lot of credibility, Jeff Goldblum, Dianne Keaton, and Harrison Ford, looking every bit his 60+ years, but still has a boyishness to his demeanor that hearkens back to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Patrick Wilson is the rom in &quot;rom-com&quot; and he holds his ground against the whirling dervishness of Rachel&apos;s character. The writing is outstanding and the one-liners, priceless.

As iterated in other comments, the DVD contains story elements that are entirely absent from the film itself (i.e. the clown!) I thought the whole film would be about that clown! well, not so my friends! The film has no cohesive sense at all. Brainless. It was just sort of thrown together haphazardly and without any thought. Also, as noted by other reviewers, the characters were totally one dimensional, surfacey, and straight up archetypes completely lacking in any development, depth, or uniqueness.\n\nTo me, it seems like a really bad indie film that somehow got a lot of funding and made it into DVD market. I feel like I can&apos;t really make any comment on the acting because, honestly, I can&apos;t imagine any actors or actresses who would be able to give this film the animation and depth that it so sorely lacks.\n\nIn short, save your money and your time, and don&apos;t see it.",

These are nameless, speechless and can trace their roots to the principles of Epic.\n\nIt can happen in any city, during the late 70s or nowadays but as a film noir in its essence, exclusively at night.\n\nThe performances are great and the car chases register no equal in film history. The pace of the delivery of lines is almost as suspensful as the story itself.\n\nThe minimalism of Hill&apos;s execution resembles the cinema of Jean Pierre Melville and the film&apos;s universe picks up there where Hawks, Walsh and Siegel left.\n\nIt&apos;s an exercise in style, a triumph of a clever mind, a loveable barren film that adresses, from particular detail, general, eternal issues."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Welcome to hell,&quot; are the eerily prophetic words, complete with shells, atmospheric all-is-not-right music and the groans of dying men, a hint of what&apos;s to come.  After the battle, out of the fog and into a German trench, the men of Y-company discover that&apos;s exactly where they&apos;ve landed.  First of all, the place is deserted.  And strewn with (mutilated) corpses of German soldiers.  All dead.  Except one (Torben Liebrecht), who warns them desperately that there is &quot;quelque chose de mal&quot; in that place, and to get out as soon as they can.  Naturally, they all ignore him, except for Shakespeare (Jamie Bell).  Soon, it proves true when the men start turning against each other, or getting sucked into the earth with barbed wire, or tying each other up à-la-crucifixion.\n\nWell.  After two years of watching this in the making, it hasn&apos;t disappointed (thank you, Mr, Bassett).  Great set-up, with the rain, the rats, trenches and mud to make Spielberg weep with envy.  While the script could use some work (&quot;what&apos;s the matter with this place?  What&apos;s happening?&quot; asks one -rhetorically?), the acting keeps the characters from becoming walking clichés, especially Jamie Bell as the unwelcome greenhorn, or Hugo Speer as the duty-bound Sgt. Tate, to name a few.  The suspense was average and wasn&apos;t so scary that there&apos;d be lost sleep over it, nor was it anything over-original.  But it&apos;s a great piece of ensemble casting (i&apos;d pay the admission again to see Hugh O&apos;Conor say the f-word), cool FX and steady directing make it a good viewing."

The setting was a believable future.\n\nThe acting was good from most of the cast. Elena Kampouris was fantastic as a robotic wife. I&apos;m wondering if some CGI trickery was involved because she&apos;s so beautiful. Almost too perfect.\n\nAnd the movie started off well... but then the plot kind of went off the rails. Some big holes, more questions than answers, a little sloppy. I think it was meant to present the viewer with moral, philosophical conundrums but they got lost along the way in the foggy plot.\n\nAlso, maybe it&apos;s just how I was reading it... but there was a theme that felt man-hatey or like the demonization of men on a biological level. If so, that I didn&apos;t care for.\n\nNevertheless, out of all the movies of this type in recent years, I liked this one not best but amongst the better of them. It&apos;s worth the hour and 45 minutes to see what you get out of it.",

I hated every intolerable minute of it and giving you a synopsis of the non-existent plot is only going to inflame me again but I&apos;m bound to my word to review it.\n\nJan (a man more chin than head) pisses off from his dingy German town for no given reason, leaving all his friends behind. They look for him but give up the chase when they come to the conclusion that he must be dead or something. Five years later he comes back for no reason to see how they&apos;ve all changed. And that&apos;s your lot, mate! Nothing else happens.\n\nThey try to inject melodrama by having Jan turn up at awkward, strange moments to confront his former pals, but it feels quite contrived. The dialogue is almost entirely pointless. Nothing of any importance is said by any character and the only lines they manage to utter seem like stock samples that are only in there to prevent it from being a silent film. Well it ain&apos;t much of a goddamn &apos;talkie&apos;.\n\nThe dialogue is usually of the following quality:\n\n&apos;Come with me.&apos; &apos;My fags are out on the balcony.&apos;\n\n&apos;I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re back.&apos; &apos;That railroad is three degrees colder.&apos;\n\nWhat??? Did I just walk into an alternate universe where bullshit makes sense?\n\nThere are far too many characters introduced at once and none of them really look all that different so you&apos;ll lose track really easily, especially since none of them say or do anything other than look perpetually depressed.\n\nThe only good thing I can mention about this truly rotten film is the skillful, if bleak, widescreen photography that briefly captures some moments of atmosphere that the film could really have used more of to prevent it from being the borefest that it is. It&apos;s too damn metaphysical and requires the audience to really read into the silences than listen to the conversation. I can do that, but not in a pretentious pile of crap such as this.\n\nNone of the women were really that attractive either but I was so bored that I was praying for some kind of nude scene. \n\nThe appearance of the end credits was like similar to that feeling after taking a really big dump. You feel hollow, dirty and worn-out, but at least it&apos;s over now!",

      "name": "A German film from 1944 that is no propaganda",
      "reviewBody": "The two best known films of Helmut Kautner are situated in shipping circles. &quot;Unter den Brucken&quot; (1946) is about inland shipping, &quot;Grosse Freiheit nr 7&quot; (1944) is about sailors.\n\n&quot;Grosse Freiheit Nr 7&quot; was made during the last phase of World War Two, and the Nazi propaganda was hoping for an heroic movie. They were utterly disappointed by the film, which was not shown in Germany until after the Second World War. To recoup some of the production costs the film was nonetheless exported to other countries.\n\nWhat exactly did arouse the resentment of the Nazi&apos;s? I think it was the sphere of melancholy ans nostalgia that permeates the film. Instead of an heroic seaman the film is about a retired sailor who earns a living by singing in a nightclub in the red light district of Hamburg.\n\nIn the beginning of the film two former ship mates are visiting his club. At the outside of the club they see their old fellow as a mechanically moved mannequin pop. At the inside the memory&apos;s of times gone by immediately set the tone.\n\nThis relationship between the old pals is more important for the ambiance of the film than all the romantic complications that are to follow. Complications that are nevertheless responsible for a magnificent dream sequence where our main character is torn apart between his love for the sea and his love for a girl he has recenly met.",

The Goldfield Hotel has since found new life as a restored historical landmark. The town itself has surged in population due to new mining processes, and the re-opening of the long closed mines. During the movie, a scene picturing the front of the &quot;Green Frog Market&quot;, you will see the faint glow of a freckle-faced, red headed little boy, gazing out of the window......yeah..it&apos;s me!!

She had been quite respectable in &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; in 1972, but she turned in a beautifully nuanced performance in this one.\n\nI would certainly argue with any notion that this film is &quot;underrated&quot;. It&apos;s always been well regarded, even back in the days when Spielberg was known as the clever kid who made &quot;Jaws&quot;. That doesn&apos;t mean it has ever been easy to see.\n\nNow, with the passage of time, &quot;Sugarland Express&quot; looks even better than it did in the 1970&apos;s. One still has no trouble at all getting caught up in the quixotic mission of these characters.",

It successfully depicts that despite the claim that war against terrorism is not war against Islam, when vengeance underscore motivation, vindication transcends borders of respects. For a movie, it was well directed, well acted, and the presentation quite successfully moved the audience to experience the multitude of human emotions that filled and colored the characters portrayed in the movie. All in all, this movie is a gem that will give the audience an alternative scenario and perspective in the fight against terrorism, especially given the the theater is filled to the brim with the Hollywood version of anti-terrorism, that are often distorted and certainly one-sided.\n\nThis movie attempted to put into light the true Islam, albeit there are fundamental differences to what some may argue as to the &apos;truer&apos; teachings of Islam would otherwise preach, as opposed to the more secular and somewhat liberated Islam as Turkey is practicing. While the attempt is commendable, the less informed audience may presume this is true of Islam. Case in point, Turkey is about the only country that accepts Muslims marrying Christian. But the well spoken message that a terrorist is automatically a non-Muslim, deserves an applaud.\n\nNeedless, this movie is not about teaching. And for the entertainment value, this movie is an outright winner.",

I smiled at the scene with that huge coffin, that&apos;s all. Massive inspired by Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Psycho&quot; and Jonathan Demme&apos;s &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the film is lost somewhere in the &quot;purgatory&quot; of these two masterpieces. The result is a mediocre parody. Not even the presence of Martin Balsam, the original detective in &quot;Psycho&quot; doesn&apos;t save the film. Not even the beauty of Joanna Pacula. Neither the sexy forms of the little Charlene Tilton. Not even Mel Brooks in his short scene. Not even those 3 cameos of John Landis, Joe Dante and John Carpenter. Ezio Greggio is OK, he has a lot of imagination but, it&apos;s not funny. Dom DeLuise(very funny comic actor in other movies) and Billy Zane are both commonplace. You will need someone to tickle you in your sensitive areas, or to tickle yourself, to succeed to laugh...",

Some interviews with the Dj&apos;s/Producers seemed to be more about the problems that they were facing, than their music. There was not any exploration of where this kind of musical scene began, which really let me down.\n\nHeading towards the end of the documentary, i began to realize that throughout the whole movie, it has been more about the problems that the couple filming and directing the movie are facing at this seems to consume the whole movie. i think it had potential to be a great movie/documentary but unfortunately i did not enjoy it as i thought that i would and i think that many others feel the same way.",

The person who had recommended it in the first place, urged me, to see two other Dan Ireland movies. The Whole Wide World, which I loved and &quot;The Velocity Of Gary&quot; which I thought it was hard to sit through, the first time, but, I must say, I felt compelled to see it a second time and by my third viewing I was in love with the movie. Then I went back to Passionada. What a different movie it was, within the context of Ireland&apos;s other work. It is the perfect piece of the puzzle that unveils the total work of an artist&apos;s life work. Ireland&apos;s theme is LOVE, AS AN IMPOSSIBLE OBJECT. In the Whole Wide World, is intellectual and tragic in Velocity of Gary, is sexual and pathetic in Passionada, he allows the characters to have a future. It is, after all, Ireland&apos;s romantic comedy. But even then, we don&apos;t really know, if we listen carefully to a throw away line by Theresa Russell &quot;Once a liar, always a liar&quot; (Or words worth that effect) To all film fans, I suggest to see the films in order, one after the other and you&apos;ll discover something to look forward to.",

It is such a heart-wrenching movie, and truly one that you can never forget.  It&apos;s the story of ulimate patriotism and friendship and loyalty.  And the best thing about it....it is about 95% true.\n\nThe score of this film is absolutely amazing.  The slow, pulsating beat that plays every time the movie his a little climax is so much more effective that the rising strings of an orchestra.  There&apos;s just a subtlety to this whole movie...the pauses and glances are just as meaningful as the worlds spoken.\n\nThis is really a classic...as was said by someone else...and it IS criminal that almost no one has seen this movie...but I&apos;m only 15..so what the hell do I know, right?  :)"

They carry on an affair which in this film is more words as promises than words as actions. I like the fact that the film begins far from where the film is mainly set, years later. Antoinette, played by Ms. Balibar, is a pretty lady, and their affair is carried out over time. The duchess, however, is married, which of course complicates matters. The film may be a little too long to get to its conclusion, but it is well acted and somewhat absorbing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of period pieces, if not anyone who craves action mostly. It held my interest though, as I said, it would have been better if they shaved twenty minutes off of it. You may like it.",

I think it&apos;s a better film in every respect, even if it is less well known: the story, of family dysfunction and human relationships, is brimming with power, and by turns tragic, bleak, and ultimately devastating.\n\nThe story sees Leo (Kim Bodnia, of PUSHER fame), attempting to adapt to family life when he finds out his girlfriend&apos;s pregnant. Along the way, he continues uneasy friendships with the racist Louis, his girlfriend&apos;s brother, and Lenny (Mads Mikkelsen), a loner who works at the local video shop. Of course things eventually become very dark indeed, and more harrowing and shocking than they were in PUSHER.\n\nRefn elicits some excellent performances from his cast, not least from Bodnia, who is quietly terrifying throughout this. A glimmer of hope and humour comes from the presence of the outstanding Mikkelsen, who is my favourite character; the video shop setting allows for plenty of cultural references for film fans. Watch out for PUSHER&apos;s Zlatko Buric as another friend. By the end, I felt like I&apos;d done ten rounds in the ring: BLEEDER is that kind of film, and excellent with it.",

However, this movie is probably one of his pitfalls. This movie definitely had its potential for being funny.  It&apos;s plot was pretty original.  A superintendent forced by law to live in his run down tenement house.  That&apos;s original!  However, I don&apos;t know why, but it just wasn&apos;t very funny. It could&apos;ve been because Pesci didn&apos;t play a spoiled adult who still takes advice from his misguided, overbearing, often wrong father.  The acting may not have been too good.  I don&apos;t know.  It just wasn&apos;t funny.  There were a few cute parts (like when Pesci dances to the M.C. Hammer music), but nothing special.  Sorry, Joe, but you&apos;ve had funnier movies."

And the entire cast of this hilarious film should be honored with a statue somewhere. &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; is a pure joy, and in 2005 America it is shockingly TIMELY since we are overrun with moralists of the sort depicted by Alan Cummings in this film.\n\nIf you enjoy a modern satire, and if you love clever music and great choreographed song numbers, this is the film for you. If you have no sense of humor, watch something else.\n\nSteven Weber and Alan Cummings put in great performances. Both are highly underrated actors who have brought magic to many films, and this is no exception. Alan Cummings comes close to stealing the show.\n\nBut in this film it is Christian Campbell who dazzles the most. He is hilarious almost beyond belief in his moments as the All-American Uber-Wholesome kid. That smile is so perfect and infectious. They could never have found anymore more perfect for this role: someone capable of moving from Mr. Wholesome to Mr. Ruined-by-Marijuana - and his singing and dancing talent came through perfectly in this film. Bravo Christian Campbell!",

Bruce Lockhart, the UK&apos;s man on the ground during the days of the Russian Revolution, Leslie Howard plays the consul general at the British Embassy whose other tasks include fomenting a little counterrevolution on the side. That&apos;s constantly getting in the way of his romance with Bolshevik Kay Francis.\n\nWhat was fascinating here was that the spy Howard was so terribly indiscreet as to allow Francis to gain valuable information for her side. As a British Agent it seemed like everything that Howard was trying came up real short except in the romance department.\n\nBut Howard and Francis are a good match in screen chemistry in the romance department. As history British Agent leaves a lot to be desired. I think had the film been done by a British studio it probably would have turned out better.",

You soon, however, realise that this is a completely different take on the idea and I had the feeling that everyone was perhaps trying a little too hard to be funny. There was certainly some snappy dialogue and it was a colourful, slushy experience that didn&apos;t succumb to my notoriously low boredom threshold.\n\nOverall, a lot of fun, despite some slightly nervy acting in places and a few scripting issues. Not laugh out loud like dear old Dudley, but an admirable attempt when you consider just how good the original was.",

      "reviewBody": "It may sound like a round of toast gone wrong but it&apos;s actually a religious term: a &quot;burnt offering&quot; occurs when an animal is incinerated on an altar as a sacrifice. The consumption is absolute – soul and all – which may give a clue as to where this 1976 gem, written and directed by horror veteran Dan Curtis, will ultimately go. \n\nMarian (Karen Black) and Ben (Oliver Reed), along with their son Davey (Lee H. Montgomery) and Aunt Elizabeth (Bette Davis) move to a rundown California mansion for the summer. The landlords are creepy siblings whose reclusive mother, Mrs Allardyce, is locked in an upstairs room. For a knock-down rent, the incoming family need only take care of the building and leave a tray of food each day for the mad woman in the attic.\n\nThe tenants move in and initially enjoy the peace and majesty of the great old house. But tempers quickly flare. Ben becomes uncommonly angry; Marian increasingly obsesses about the unseen Mrs Allardyce; and Elizabeth falls prey to a terrible manic illness. Is Mrs Allardyce the cause of all these tensions? Or could it be the house itself, which seems to bloom into life as its inhabitants succumb to mutually assured destruction?\n\nFor fans of The Haunting (the Robert Wise version, obviously) and The Shining, this is a must-see psychological horror which has been relatively &quot;overlooked&quot; (Shining joke). In a way, Burnt Offerings is a relic from a time where scares were more understated whilst, paradoxically, performances were more melodramatic. It doesn&apos;t parody these genre aspects in the way that Kubrick&apos;s monolithic milestone would do four years later, but instead plays everything straight. Which is why it seems such an oddity, coming at a mid-70s moment after the dawn of the new allegorical horror of Romero, Hooper, and Craven and before the seedy/gory horror heyday of the 1980s. It&apos;s more like The Exorcist, pagan style. \n\nThe film relies principally on atmosphere and gradually growing sense of menace and madness. For the first two thirds it&apos;s impossible to tell where the insanity lies. Is it in Marian, with her discomforting interest in Mrs Allardyce? Or Ben, whose visions of his mother&apos;s hearse are pushing him to hysteria, manifesting as rage? The dynamics work not only thanks to strong lead performances, but because Curtis takes time and care to portray a functioning family, comfortable with each other&apos;s foibles; so when the fractures appear, it&apos;s genuinely disturbing. When the playful, protective Ben starts wrestling his son in the pool to the point of drowning, it&apos;s not only intense but feels terribly wrong. Moreover, the dialogue throughout is well written, so when the silliness kicks in we take it seriously. \n\nSupport-wise, Anthony James – a know-his-face actor who played many a memorable creep – rocks up occasionally to smile sinisterly, and there&apos;s a supremely creepy cameo from Burgess &quot;Penguin&quot; Meredith, playing Mrs Allardyce&apos;s son, who watches Davey playing from the window whilst practically dribbling.\n\nThe framing, lighting, and production design is top-notch, and the editing is meaningful. This is a work of poise and control; and these qualities are consistent all the way to the final Hitchcockian scene, which is scary in spite of being, by that point, predictable. Burnt Offerings is a slow, stately, dense psychological horror, low on gore and obvious shocks – and all the more impactful for it.",

      "name": "Less like a geographical reboot of D-9 and more like an art-house Cloverfield or a blockbuster Stalker",
      "reviewBody": "While there have been plenty of valid comparisons made between this film and last year&apos;s sci-fi hit District - 9 (due solely to the fact that the two films share an admittedly similar global concept; that of aliens landing and being contained within a restricted zone as a forced but entertaining allegory for racial disharmony. There the zone was in central South Africa and here it is the northernmost section of Mexico, the borderlands.) I think the media have missed the much more obvious filmic connections. To my mind this film is in fact less like a geographical reboot of D-9 and more like an art-house Cloverfield or perhaps a blockbuster Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky&apos;s epically sparse sci-fi classic). While the concept and metaphor certainly match that of District – 9 the closest the execution sways it further towards a combination of the latter two examples.\n\nInstead of attempting to tell the story of a fictional universe using a number of cipher characters like D-9, this film instead tells the story of its two leads by way of its alien infestation. The titular monsters certainly are an integral force in crafting and driving the films narrative but they are not its real focus, this is where the two films differ. Instead we are made to follow American investigate journalist Colbert who is tasked by his employer to find and then accompany his daughter through the infected zone and into the United States before the beginning of the creature&apos;s active season.\n\nIt&apos;s a sparse plot and one that leads to a lot less action than you would expect, but it does work as the spinal centre of the film. Instead of confronting the creatures at every turn, discovering their origin, their weakness, their queen and then eventually using their knowledge to develop a dues ex machina and save the day like the big damn heroes of every similar film, these two simply exist in the universe like we do ours; as everyday citizens living their everyday lives. That&apos;s not to say though that the film is in any way banal; in fact their journey through the zone allows for a lot of stunning shots, shocking stories and silent terror, it&apos;s just that these occur in a different tense then we are used to. We are, like the protagonist Colbert, journalists in this world; we follow in the wake of the story, catching occasional glimpses of it from afar but mainly focusing on who and what it leaves behind.\n\nThe monsters, their destruction and the alternate world that they destroy are all filtered through the protagonists before they reach us upon the screen. It is their reactions to the events that elicit responses in us and their responses that in turn become our emotions. It is essential that the two leads be well crafted in order for this method to work. Thankfully then, they are; Hitting that perfect ratio of realism, stereotype, flaw and likability. They are the kind of characters that you would happily follow within the comparatively banal confines of a drama and so here, in this realm of heightened stakes, they become doubly interesting. The real surprise of the film for me was just how enjoyable, and oftentimes moving, it was to take this trip with the leads; to the point that by the time the ending rolled around I almost echoed their calls of &apos;I don&apos;t want to go home&apos;. That dreaded disillusionment, the return to drudgery after a distinctly powerful event is something I can really understand but it is something uncommon to see in cinemas. Edwards isn&apos;t the only person to be thanked for this though; while his writing is great it&apos;s the two lead performances that are really essential and I think these two will be ones too watch in the future.\n\nWhile I&apos;ve made it quite clear that personally I preferred the human side of the story - that I could take or leave the monsters in comparison – i know there are many others around here who will not feel the same, others that are in it for the monsters (Spaulds certainly comes to mind). While I wouldn&apos;t advise taking that particular approach with this particular film, I don&apos;t think any of you creature features that do will be disappointed with what you see – and yes, you do see. The creatures are as well designed and animated as the characters. They feel totally alien to this world yet retain a certain sense of plausibility, as if they could feasibly belong to some other. Their power is also very well handled, being threatening enough in every situation but invincible in none. There is then a consistency to them that doesn&apos;t exist in a lot of other creatures, which sometimes feel like they are acting in accordance with the plot rather than their own rules or reality. While this may get some of you salivating I have to say again that well designed or no these creatures are little more than an external force, they exist off screen much more than on.\n\nIt is then, an ironically titled film I guess because the Monsters of the title are anything but central. I think the real test should be whether or not you would go and see this film were it called &apos;Humans&apos;. Those that do, more specifically those that make their way all the way through to the final act, will be in for a treat as the film has a handful of utterly sublime moments. The ending itself was a little abrupt but I think it&apos;s pretty clever, probably warranting a second watch. Definitely warranting a first watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Arizona Bushwackers was the last of three B westerns that Howard Keel made during the Sixties. He also did Waco and Red Tomahawk. He also appeared in support of John Wayne and Kirk Douglas in the acclaimed War Wagon. This film ain&apos;t no war wagon.\n\nIt&apos;s not horribly bad film, Arizona Bushwackers, it&apos;s just a very tired one. A lot of hackneyed clichés jammed into the 90+ minutes of the running time. Howard Keel plays a former Confederate who earns a pardon from the Union Army and an out from a federal prison by agreeing to join the Union Army, but serve in the western frontier as opposed to the war in the east.\n\nKeel even rates a special job as sheriff of a lawless Arizona town called Colton after mayor Brian Donlevy calls for help. Saloon owner Scott Brady and partner Marilyn Maxwell like the wide open town that Colton is and don&apos;t cotton to no law and order.\n\nIn fact Keel himself has never really forgotten his rebel roots and has been biding for time to pull something off.\n\nAll these plot strands get themselves resolved in one of the dumbest Indian attacks I&apos;ve ever seen staged on film. The once popular players set themselves all around with various weaponry on either side of the main street and the Indians ride by and just keep getting picked off.\n\nOthers in Arizona Bushwackers include Barton MacLane, Yvonne DeCarlo, James Craig, and John Ireland. It&apos;s a regular convention of movie names who hit their peaks during the forties and fifties. It&apos;s also the farewell film of director Lesley Selander who did just about a gazillion B westerns in his day.\n\nNo matter how dumb the film, it&apos;s nice to see all these stars together in one film. And the opening narration is given by a bigger movie name than all of these who did the off camera speech as a favor to his friend, producer A.C. Lyles.\n\nFor nostalgia fans only.",

The plot is good, but maybe a little conventional overall, and if the details aren&apos;t completely predictable, the general flow of events is. The whole cast is quite good--Foster in a familiar embattled, determined role, and Jared Leto is an appropriately crazed, if slightly caricatured, bad guy who just wants money. Don&apos;t we all.\n\nI saw this when it came out and was dazzled and yet disappointed by the plot. The second time, knowing the events, I was able to just watch how they unfolded, and it was much better. Expect suspense, intensity, and beautiful camera-work.",

      "reviewBody": "A movie inspired by a tragic maritime event happened in 1816 and a movie produced in France and in Iran, &quot;le radeau de la Méduse&quot; is a movie that required 4 years of work! During this very long time, you feel that the director, Iradj Azimi significantly put a lot of time and effort in his project. But his efforts weren&apos;t vain at all because the result is terrific.\n\nIn his movie, Azimi&apos;s speaking to the spectator. It means that he tries to understand and explain us how such the &quot;Méduse&quot; drama could happen. Thus, his directing turns out to be rigorous, precise and sometimes inventive. There&apos;s also a quiet but sustained use of the voice-over.\n\nIf the director chose to shot his film with a special photography (that spawned several gorgeous pictures), it&apos;s because he wanted to find similar colors again as the ones used on Géricault&apos;s famous painting. It deals with dark but a little shiny colors. This photography gives more strength to the dramatic side of the story. You can also notice that Azimi decided to shot the appalling castaways&apos; living conditions with a minimum of reserve. Thanks to this, it avoids the movie to fall into the sordid.\n\nA stunning movie supported by a quite weird but fascinating photography and Jean Yanne&apos;s extraordinary performance."

      "reviewBody": "This is quite possibly the best of the Hammer films, it&apos;s labeled as &apos;horror&apos;, but is more of a classic psychological thriller. The plot revolves around Susan Strasberg&apos;s visit to her father&apos;s estate after a decade of estrangement. Her physical condition (in a wheelchair, unable to walk after a horseback riding accident) and the recent death of her long time companion set her up to be the &apos;perfect victim&apos;.\n\nHer step mother, Ann Todd, and the family chauffeur Ronald Lewis are oh-so accommodating and thoughtful, explaining that her father is out of town. But, Strasberg starts to see dead dad popping up all over, while Todd, Lewis, and family doctor Christopher Lee try to persuade her she&apos;s just stressed and overly-imaginative. Is she crazy? Are they gas-lighting her? Although the viewer will remain suspicious, we are wisely kept in the dark as to motives (of all the characters..) until the final twist. The black and white photography is really well done -moody, shadowy - and is probably as important as the characters which is not the usual Hammer screamer in intense shades of red.",

      "reviewBody": "This was shown on World Movies last night. I didn&apos;t quite know what to expect, but I thought it might be something like Possession, the excellent novel by A S Byatt which was made into a much less good film; i.e., a story in which a present-day researcher solves a mystery about some aspect of the life of a historical figure. Well, it is that: the historical figure is the painter Watteau, and the present-day researcher is Lucie Audibert, who is played charmingly by Sylvie Testud.\n\nThere&apos;s a side-story about a deaf-mute mime who does his act outside Lucie&apos;s work, and with whom she strikes up a relationship. It adds little to the film, although there seems to be some real chemistry between Lucie and the mime, Vincent, played by James Thiérrée.\n\nI found it quite compelling. The pictures on the screen are beautiful: the cinematography is by Jean-Marc Selva, which is not a name I had ever heard before, but it one I&apos;ll look out for in the future. The story moves along steadily, never hurriedly, and an atmosphere of tension is gradually created and built. Although Watteau is long dead, there&apos;s a sense of sadness and loss at the part of his life that is revealed, which is complemented and counterpointed by the sadness and almost desperation that surrounds Lucie&apos;s. Sylvie Testud is superb. She&apos;s as thin as a sparrow and not particularly pretty, but one of the things I like about French films in general and this one in particular is that they are about (not always, of course, but quite often) rather ordinary-looking people who are shown to be men and women of substance.\n\nI&apos;ve given it a score of 8 out of 10. I&apos;d prefer to have given it 7.5, but that&apos;s not possible, and it&apos;s better than a 7. It&apos;s not a great film, but it&apos;s a very thoughtful one.",

      "reviewBody": "Thanks to the internet and cable TV, the flow of porn and erotic movies is more pulsating and accessible than ever. While there&apos;s been attempts sometimes to profile &quot;erotic movies&quot; as a quality product, done out of a wish to express the joy of sex, the staples of the trade are still commercialized and the content often very raw. Alexa Wolf&apos;s documentary, made for Swedish public TV in 2000 but relevant far outside Sweden, attempts to show up the exploitative sex flick business, by often disgusting clips from hardcore porno movies and interviews with actresses, models, producers and others in the trade. She makes some sweeping claims about porno movies just growing out of general male domination of society, but it also fleshes out the link between how women are portrayed in the media and in porn, and the suppressed fear or timidity many girls feel in ordinary life.\n\nMany of the clips speak for themselves in their brutality, and the interviews are telling, not least by what is not said. Predictacly, she chose the worst she could find, and predictably, defenders of libertarianism claimed that &apos;you gotta take the girls&apos; word for it when they say, they&apos;re doing this stuff because they like it and make easy money&quot; &apos;, and also branded Ms Wolf as a lesbian fanatic. Critics even alleged that Ms Wolf should have asked the producers and models of the porno reels for permission to use extracts from their works.\n\nThe film compares interestingly with Lukas Moodysson&apos;s &quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot; which is more cogent artistically but explores much the same ground. Both films also make the point that this is an international phenomenon.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film that shows the different love relations between common people in a neighbourhood around a Tapas-bar. The film keeps you tied to your seat, just wanting to see what&apos;s happening next, and takes you closer to people&apos;s feelings, and recapitulation of concepts in front of extreme situations that alter their reality. From the old lady who sells drugs in the Tapas-bar, afraid of loosing her husband. The owner of the bar, whose wife runs away tired of him, and he prefers to hide his new situation, the woman in the local shop, that lives on her own and keeps a relationship throughout internet but falls for a physical relation with a younger men, all spiced with a pinch of Spanish humour, reality and sadness. The cast is pretty good, the new talent Rubén Ochandiano, or consecrated actors such as Angel De Andrés López, Elvira Minguez or the Argentinian Alberto De Mendoza. All in all, it&apos;s a good taste of Spanish cinema, besides the world known imagination of Almodovar.",

      "reviewBody": "The spirit of a comatose hazing victim inhabits a scarecrow and takes revenge on his tormentors. First question: What&apos;s up with all these scarecrow movies? I think I missed the beginning of the trend. Are they all inspired by the opening sequence of &apos;Jeepers Creepers 2&apos;? Sadly, none of the ones I have pulled down from the shelves of my local Blockbuster have lived up that sequence. This one, however, seemed to start well. The opening sequence, where a young woman is stalked in the cornfield by the scarecrow works reasonably well. It is helped by the fact that the scarecrow is only seen sparingly. When used sparingly, the scarecrow makeup works well, but, as a result of overuse, it begins to look like a cheap mask. It looked as fake as the breasts of the woman who plays the nurse. Gratuitous nudity aside, this film has little to compliment. I was inclined to praise the video photography until I watched the &apos;making of&apos; documentary that revealed it was shot on film. For video it looked good. For film it sucked. The performances were both overwrought and overripe. Granted, there really wasn&apos;t much actors could do with the script. It was stupid. The overheated relationships were never believable. Still, it might&apos;ve worked on the most visceral level if the film was scary, but it wasn&apos;t. One of the things that hurt it was a whistling theme that revealed the presence of the scarecrow. At first I thought the theme existed only on the soundtrack, but later characters in the film started hearing it. I found it funny, and I would start snickering every time I heard it, which effectively undermined all the thrills. This might not be the worst horror film out there, but it does lurk dangerously near the bottom of the barrel."

      "reviewBody": "I just saw ¡Ay Juancito!. A friend highly recommended it and I found it at a Blockbuster store here in Buenos Aires. Excellent! The pacing of the movie is very smooth, the actors are good, Adrián Navarro as Juan Duarte -the &apos;Hero&apos; of the movie- Laura Novoa as Evita Perón, Leticia Brédice as Yvonne Pascal (Not the name of the real actress in this true story) and all the others in the cast. An amazing achievement of the casting was that of Alejandra Majluf as Niní Marshall, since she looks almost exactly like her! The recreation of the period -about 1950- was very good, even the colors looked like those of the old Technicolor.\n\nThe wardrobe was designed by Horace Lane, who actually designed clothes for Evita, so the accuracy of the women dresses is flawless. So were the make up and hair styles. The interiors were recreated quite lavishly and accurately. And we must consider that a great deal of ingenuity must have been used, since Argentinian movies are made with budgets that will only cover few minutes of shooting an American movie!\n\nThere are a couple of scenes that are intensely moving, one is when Evita is forced to renounce to the vice presidency of the country due to her gender (The excuse given to the people at the time was another) and to the threat that she represented to the military, the church and the oligarchy of the country. \n\nThe other scene is (I don&apos;t consider the following *A SPOILER* since this movie is not fiction and everybody knows contemporary history) the one of her death. Wow! with a minimum fuss this actress accomplished a very delicate and subtle ending of a very painful agony. The more I think about this movie, the more impressed I am with it. I&apos;ll check Héctor Olivera&apos;s work (The Director) to see the rest of his production.",

      "reviewBody": "What is perhaps one of the best beginnings to a film helps lay the foundation for the rest of this film. Janos is brought to the center of the room being told that, &quot;it is time.&quot; From here Janos begins a remedial science lesion on the cosmos. He begins by using a drunken bar patron as the sun. Then another as the earth. Finally, another as the moon. He explains the rotation of the three celestial bodies in what appears to be a drunken daze. However, Janos stop the rotation of the bar patrons and begins his monologue. Janos&apos; language changes; the music resonates throughout the scene. Janos gives the patrons an allegorical tale of the eclipse; stating the sense of unrest that the animals and people experience as this sudden change shadows the earth. However, the chaos is only momentary. Order is soon restored. Shortly after his speech, Janos and the drunken patrons begin to dance at which point the barkeep kicks Janos out of the bar. In a rather ominous tone, Janos exclaims to the barkeep that &quot;it is not over.&quot;   I summarize the beginning of this spectacular film because the magnificent Bela Tarr has laid out everything we need to know in these short 11 minutes to understand his work. We are told that the story is going to be an allegory; an allegory of great chaos brought upon a population of the ignorant (The eclipse frightening the animals natural order of life). We are told that most everything in the film will be symbolic (The earth, sun, and moon acting as natural life with disorder). We are given the weather conditions and the dereliction of the town which further sets the tone of the film. Finally, we are given the pace of the film. Patience is needed. A film captured in a mere 39 shots in what feels archaic black and white (Again acting as a symbol for the Post WWII desolate town and its intoxicated population).   The film follows our protagonist, Janos, as he meanders through his life playing an oxymoronic archetype of the wise fool. His small Hungarian town is awakened from their inexorable lassitude by the arrival of a circus attraction. This attraction is a giant stuffed whale and accompanying the whale is The Prince; a mysterious and shamanistic disturbance to the town&apos;s feeling of unrest and neglect. The Prince then capitalizes on the ignorance of the town, leading them to form a mob and storm the hospital. Janos is forced to play the unifier and bring the town out of the eclipse.   Tarr has created literature in motion with this masterpiece. Harmonies is more of an experience than anything else. I watched this film maybe 10 years ago and am just now writing this review. The film resonates and challenges our ability to interpret. It is almost like we as viewers would wish to have a SparkNotes page for this film, so we could understand the symbolic nature of the whale, the prince, and so much more. Yet, we are given no interpretations; just as I will leave you with no further explanations. Just a recommendation to find this film and let patience truly be the greatest virtue of them all.",

True, one or two are barely given time to register before Dennis Price dispatches them (Lady Agatha would have been interesting as a fully rounded character), but those which are developed - Henry, the photography enthusiast in particular, are cleverly played and memorable.  Price also does well in his role.  The ladies - Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson - are excellent.  The great strength of this film is in its black humour, and of course in its delicious twist ending.  I can&apos;t bear to think of it remade with a 2000&apos;s gloss."

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to Gangster movies, only the romantic lens of Kar Wai Wong could result in a movie that features a couple captured in loving embrace on its DVD cover and a title befitting a melodramatic sob-fest as opposed to the blood-thirsty, violent display that it actually aspires to be. Awash with a heavy-handed eighties synth-rock soundtrack that does absolutely nothing for the film some twenty years onwards, As Tears Go By is the byproduct of a director being given the reigns for the very first time and quite naturally, not quite knowing how to implement the hundreds of ideas that he has brewing around in his brain. Indeed, while much of the script is very barebones material drawing heavily influences from Scorsese&apos;s Mean Streets amongst other higher-budget Hollywood features, it is Wong&apos;s frantic, almost schizophrenic pacing and storytelling that gives it a voice of its own. Sure, it&apos;s a voice that at this point in time is still very much in its infancy—awkward and stilted—yet you can nevertheless see where the director was going with this, his directorial debut.\n\nTelling the story of two Triad &quot;brothers&quot; as they battle the passions of themselves and those around them, As Tears Go By is an interesting take on the already well-established gangster movie format. Inherent here are the typical staples; the partners at odds with each other, one a young hot-headed blood-thirsty shark looking to go places and his Big Brother, a cool, laid-back veteran with little to no ambition. Brought together, the two end up at odds with other gangsters and loan sharks who consistently threaten death upon both of them should they fail to make ends meet. This tangent which naturally plays out as nine tenths of Wong&apos;s story here, bounces back and forth between genuinely compelling action and frustratingly caricaturist drama that seems to repeat itself every twenty minutes. Indeed, if there is any fault to As Tears Go By at all, it exists in Wong&apos;s insistence in elaborate, almost inconsequential set-pieces that are fun to watch the first or second time, but wear thin after you realize not much else is happening.\n\nOn the other side of the pond however lies a romantic subplot that has given As Tears Go By and indeed Wong himself their names in the cinematic landscape. Centering around the older brother and his passionate affair with his distant cousin who comes to stay for a while, the love story here as it is displayed, is fine and one can understand how audiences may have been moved by its appearance here within an otherwise stoic and bloody display of testosterone, yet suffocated by so much of said action, nothing much is achieved from this deviation. The result is something more akin to a distraction than a truly compelling romance; indeed, while many claim the scene which adorns the DVD cover (which depicts the two in a passionate kiss inside a phone booth) to be representative of Wong&apos;s romanticist indulgences that would permeate much of his later career as a film-maker, its initial appearance here is tepid at best. Instead I point to the movie&apos;s closing sequence as its most affirming and memorable; it&apos;s not exactly a typical Wong depiction, yet it&apos;s startling, moving and even just a little bit romantic at the same time too.\n\nIn the end, while As Tears Go By stands as a significant and interesting insight into a director&apos;s early footsteps in directorial shoes, much of the feature stands as too half-baked in areas that matter most and overly heavy-handed in areas which only lead to grating and often confusing indulgences. Sure enough, the performances are fine and the movie itself exists as a fair enough take on an already done-to-death genre, yet burdened with a fairly straight-forward script that caters very little to Wong&apos;s subtler strengths as a director (which he would find a decade on), much of this debut is rendered a mere artifact of curiosity for those interested; those looking for a genuinely thrilling, or enjoyable movie however should stay clear—As Tears Go By certainly has its moments, but lacks the connective tissue to bind it all together."

While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).\n\nIf you liked Carrey&apos;s earlier works, you&apos;ll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It&apos;s what he was born to do.",

      "reviewBody": "Inspired by a story from Stephen King but having very little to do with it just the same, &quot;Sometimes They Come Back... For More&quot; ensures you probably won&apos;t be coming back for more any time soon. The third installment in the increasingly absurdly-titled and logically-flawed &quot;Sometimes They Come Back For More&quot; series, &quot;...For More&quot; finds two soldiers crash-landing on a remote base in Antarctica on a mission to investigate some rather strange occurrences. See, it appears that somebody gave a group of amateur film-makers a little bit of cash and a license to leave their mark on a vaguely recognizable franchise.\n\n&quot;Sometimes They Come Back ...For More&quot; is about as bland as direct- to-video horror gets, especially late &apos;90s DTV fare. When most of your talent lies at the feet of Corky from TV&apos;s &quot;Murphy Brown,&quot; you know you&apos;re in dire straits. And while the thinly-veiled attempt at ripping off John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot; should at least make for a mildly interesting watch, the film-makers lack the skill or the means necessary to squeeze any tension or dread out of the situation. However, if you consider boredom a form of horror, then prepare to be scared out of your skin!\n\nReally, if not for the fact that this film carries a somewhat familiar title, it would never have seen the light of day, let alone been made. While there is a remotely interesting twist towards the end of the film, its execution is so clumsy, it bottoms out long before the credits mercifully roll out. &quot;Sometimes They Come Back ...For More.&quot; But you won&apos;t. And unsurprisingly, a fourth film has yet to be produced in this franchise.",

Granted, the scenery and cinematography are very good, the music is good enough(no Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvestri though) and Jet Li does try hard in his role. But the direction is uninspired, the story is clichéd(as are the characters), the pacing is uneven, the CGI is superficial and distracting, the script is awful and with the exception of Li(the only actor who tries) the acting is dreadful. Maria Bello is alluring but forgets her acting skills, Brendan Fraser is disappointingly bland and John Hannah&apos;s Jonathan is rather tiresome. The comedy and adventure this time around seems rather tired too. Overall, a big disappointment. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "How many westerns have there been about the life of Belle Starr? For that matter who knows that much about her real life? I remember seeing this film as a youngster and fell in love with it. I have always liked civil war films and 20th Cent. Fox put together a very good cast in the 1941 version. Gene Tierney plays the bandit queen very well, despite forcing herself to use a phony southern accent throughout the film. Randolp Scott is resplendent as captain Sam Starr, a renegade who rounds up bunch of confederate soldiers near the end of the civil war to stir up trouble in post war Missouri. Scott hates carpetbaggers and yankee soldiers in equal amounts and has no problem raiding banks and railroads for booty. Along the way he meets up with Belle Starr, who finds Scott very brave. Belle Starr is a fiery southern belle and when the yankees burn down her home because she is caught harboring Captain Starr, she joins forces with the rebels in her hatred against the transplanted Yankee forces sent to Missouri to clean out the &quot;rebel rabble&quot;. An odd love twist forms when her childhood friend, Dana Andrews, a yankee captain, fights to conceal his true feelings for her and his hatred against Sam Starr and his rebel friends. Along the way Scott and Tierney become married and continue raiding and chasing out carpetbaggers out of Missouri. The twosome become a Missouri legend, much to the anger of the yankee forces trying to capture them. Jasper Tench, a town misfit and drunk, shoots and kills Belle Starr near the end of the film, sending Scott into surrendering to the yankee forces. Good scene at end when Scott surrenders to Andrews and both men nearly lose their composure in sadness over Belle&apos;s death. Belle&apos;s &quot;mammy&quot;, played by Louise Beavers in a good supporting role adds a touch of warmth and comfort to Belle throughout the film.\n\nGood performances by Chill Wills as a redneck southern soldier, and John Shepard who plays Belle&apos;s brother, Ed. You might get teary eyed at the end of this film. Excellent western."

I guess I enjoyed the film, especially the Mongolian landscapes. What, on the other hand, struck me as I read that review was how simply deranged he sounded. Having serious personal issues is one thing, but not taming them and then going so far as to write such a pretentious review, wreaking of self-importance and instability like this one, is another thing. I guess I write this as I sometimes tire of fully grown &apos;normal&apos; people, so clearly suffering from issues they choose to ignore, and who confuse their need to expiate personal venom with a &apos;review&apos;. It sounds grotesque, and helps no one to understand anything about the film - more about the author&apos;s instabilities. In passing, I congratulate the filmmakers on a well made and touching near-zero budget film. We&apos;d be so much poorer if we didn&apos;t have such people making these films.",

Although the story is OK, there wasn&apos;t the same vibe that we got from the Rock Hudson and James Garner films of a few years earlier. The good points were Brian Keith, who puts in a nice quiet performance (despite him not being a favourite of mine) and one or two of the &apos;rest of cast&apos; actors. About half way through, I said to my wife it would have been a lot better if James Garner had played the Brian Keith part, and she instantly agreed. Maybe the time for this type of movie was passing, maybe the earlier films had been so good that nothing could repeat the formula. OK to pass the time, but once was enough.",

Stories taking place during the Nazi regime and WW2, especially when made by Germans, sometimes tend to be ultra-politically-correct. But, surprise, surprise. Rolf Schübel&apos;s first feature (he did documentaries before) uses backdrop of Nazi-occupied Budapest to deliver a meaningful &quot;menage-a-quatre&quot;, wrapped in a free interpretation of creation of famous suicide hymn &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;. Fine acting all over the place, especially by Krol and Becker (still brave in German moviemaking to show a Nazi not as a complete monster, even if he is, after all, the bad guy), and despite the overall sad story executed surprisingly lighthanded. Drama, a touch of humor, some suspense and even some sex (however, the latter seems to be  unnecessary sometimes - it would have worked without or with less). Not to be forgotten: excellent soundtrack album, including several versions of &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;. Definitely one of the best German movies of 1999.",

      "name": "&quot;But That&apos;s Another Story&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "When I first saw Irma La Douce as much as I liked it, I was puzzled by the fact that Billy Wilder had chosen to do this hit musical without any songs in it. Very much like Fanny from a few years ago which also had a French setting and came to the screen without its score. The Broadway cast album was a staple in my house and I certainly enjoyed the songs that Keith Mitchell and Elizabeth Seal and the rest of the cast did on Broadway.\n\nWhat made it more puzzling was the presence of Bruce Yarnell in the movie cast, the possessor of a really nice baritone voice, he played opposite Ethel Merman in the Lincoln Center revival of Annie Get Your Gun. That together with the fact Shirley MacLaine first made her mark in musical roles, in fact she had starred in the screen version of Can-Can the two years before.\n\nWell, according to the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov in fact this film started out as a musical. Somewhere there is some footage of MacLaine, Yarnell, possibly even Jack Lemmon and Lou Jacobi doing some musical numbers lying in a vault somewhere. Wilder said he thought the numbers slowed the pace of the story and midpoint in the film he just scrapped what he had shot and didn&apos;t bother with the rest.\n\nPersonally I wish he had kept the numbers in, maybe it would have made Irma La Douce run too long. Who knows maybe we&apos;ll get to see them some day.\n\nShirley MacLaine got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the title role. She&apos;s a good natured working girl who has the misfortune to get busted by the one cop in Paris who is not winking at prostitution on his first day on his new beat. That would be Jack Lemmon who for his honest law enforcement gets himself fired.\n\nThat far from ends it as Lemmon falls for MacLaine and like he did in The Apartment sees himself as her savior. The rest of the film is the ridiculous lengths Lemmon goes to save MacLaine from her life of sin and debauchery. \n\nHis one confidante is Lou Jacobi who plays Moustache the owner of a local bistro where the girls and their mecs(that&apos;s French for pimp) hang out. His role was originally intended for Charles Laughton.\n\nBilly Wilder has a well deserved reputation as a cynical observer of humankind and had some run ins with several Hollywood greats. But he became an unabashed admirer of Charles Laughton after working with him on Witness for the Prosecution. The tenderest part of that Wilder biography tells about how Wilder kept visiting Laughton up to the end discussing the part with both of them knowing it was never to be. Yet I wish Laughton had lived to do the part. It would really have been special.\n\nBruce Yarnell&apos;s part is that of MacLaine&apos;s mec. His career too was tragically cut short by a plane crash that he was killed in later in the decade. Terrific voice, nice screen and stage presence, what a terrible thing to happen.\n\nThough I would have liked to have seen the musical, I can&apos;t fault Billy Wilder&apos;s production of Irma La Douce. The fact that this came to the screen at all was further demonstration of the Code finally being lifted from the backs of the creative. \n\nMaybe we will see a full blown musical adaptation of Irma La Douce some day. But that&apos;s another story.",

Spike Lee&apos;s film about a barber shop centers around the main character Zack. Zack takes over the barbershop after Joe is mysteriously murdered.  But it becomes apparent that Zack will follow in Joe&apos;s footsteps down the wrong path.  The movie is a glimpse into the world of an urban jungle where it&apos;s survival of the fittest whether you like it or not."

It was one hell of a crazy trip, and every time I thought I knew what was going on there was another twist. I recommend it to those who loved the insanity of Natural Born Killers, or if you just want to try something different. Dave Larsen as Odessa displayed some great acting abilities and reminded me of Mickey Rourke back in his hay days, not to mention he looked bad ass with skeleton face make-up and wielding a shotgun. The acting by C.T. Miller as Mr. Ryan and Nanette Bianchi as Jami entertained the hell out of me, and I loved every minute of it. This movie had me cracking up from beginning to end, and was quite surprised by all the crazy twists. See this film........",

In the biography of Miles Davis this is the peak of a change that brought a jazz musician who was already a legend, but only in the rather conscripted world of jazz on the world screen of the widely known pop music.\n\nThe documentary does a pretty good job explaining the transition undergone by Davis in the years before Wight, his permanent search of new means of expression, his discovery of the capabilities of the electric instruments and his push to fellow musicians which changed the life and art of no lesser names like Chick Corea, Carlos Santana, Herbie Hancock and other. These artists outlived Davis, and they tell their stories on screen, but I mostly liked the final homage brought by each of them in musical language at the end of the film. And in-between we have filmed excerpts of the concert which represented a MILEStone in the history of music.",

      "reviewBody": "The Razor&apos;s Edge (1946)\n\nA stately, dramatic, richly nuanced film about love, true love, and the love of life. It&apos;s about what matters, and what doesn&apos;t, in a high society world George Cukor could have filmed, but this is by director Edmund Goulding, coming off of a series of war films, and with the great Grand Hotel from 1932 in his trail. Some people will find this a touch stiff or slow, or rather too nuanced, but I think none of the above at all. It has the richness of the Somerset Maugham novel it is based on, and Goulding had just filmed (the same year) Of Human Bondage, another Maugham novel. In both cases, the writer contributed to the screenplay, and the combination of the two of them seems really perfect. \n\nTyrone Power is an interesting lead man, as the idealistic and handsome Larry Darrell, and in some ways his restraint and almost studied dullness at times is maybe what the film needs for its rich, calm trajectory through the twenty years it covers. He&apos;s as stable and &quot;good&quot; as the wise, knowing figure of the author, who appears in the form of actor Herbert Marshall. Gene Tierney as Power&apos;s counterpart and eventually counterpoint plays the spoiled woman with cool, dramatic perfection. She&apos;s got energy and edge and beauty from every angle, and she maintains just that slightest duplicity in every scene, so you are kept on your toes.\n\nThe only forced and almost laughable section is the one that demands we think profound thoughts...the guru in India being guru to our hero. Unfortunately, it lasts for fifteen minutes, and though there is a spiritual necessity to the experience he has there, this spiritual aspect is implied just as fully in the worldly scenes that follow. I can picture a far better movie without this insert, and I can picture the director picturing it, too. Someone knows why it got patched in, and for whom, but this is what we have. \n\nIt has to be said the filming, as conservative as it is in many ways, is spot-on gorgeous. The brightly lit, ornamented, busy sets are actually inhabited by the camera, and the figures move together not only across the field, but front to back as well, in triangles and curves of visual activity, yet with fluidity--it&apos;s all contained and lyrically delicious. This is done without ostentatious mood, without sharp angles and bold lighting, but instead with spatial arrangements, always full, no emptiness, no great shadows, always something more to see. A great example, easy to find, is the very last scene, just before the shot on the boat when the end titles run. Watch how Marshall walks the long way around Tierney, and then she walks around him, and the camera keeps them framed side to side, front to back. It&apos;s nothing short of brilliant, and yet, in style, so different than say Toland doing Kane or, at another extreme, Ozu doing Tokyo Story. But no less spectacular.\n\nAt one point, a minor character, a defrocked priest, says to Darrell in a working class bar, &quot;You sound like a very religious man who does not believe in God.&quot; The movie is really about godliness, or what Maugham calls &quot;goodness&quot; in the end. And some people have it, and share it, and make the world better, God or no God.",

      "reviewBody": "Like Mighty Aphrodite and Manhattan Murder Mystery, Small Time Crooks is the kind of movie Woody Allen would have made lots more of if he hadn&apos;t, in the post Annie Hall 1970s, started thinking of himself primarily as film auteur, rather than comedian. I count myself among those who are very glad he made the detour into Art that produced such original and challenging films as Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Husbands and Wives, and Deconstructing Harry. Small Time Crooks has a much lower level of ambition. Still, like most people in the audience at the showing I attended, I found much in it very amusing. \n\nThe film&apos;s comic plot starts out like Take the Money and Run revisited, but then takes a number of surprising turns. Along the way, Tracy Ullman, Elaine Stritch, and - especially - Elaine May all give scene-stealing performances. Early Woody one-liners and sight gags sparkle through the script (along with, unfortunately, a higher frequency of duds and chestnuts than in early Woody). Also adding an interesting dimension to the comedy is the influence of The Honeymooners on the relationship between Ray and Frenchie Winkler (Woody and Tracy) and on the film&apos;s fish-out-of-water class-based situation comedy. Woody has often professed his admiration for The Honeymooners, but this is the first film where he seems to have consciously reached for similar themes and effects. \n\nOn the down side, some of the plot twists seem downright arbitrary and amateurish, especially those involving Frenchie&apos;s comeuppance. Inadequate comic use is made of Ray&apos;s gang of losers (Jon Lovitz has one good line and too little screen time). And Hugh Grant as a Bluebeard wannabe is too much to ask of any audience. As to Woody himself .... what can you say? It&apos;s painful to watch his late career hardening of the comic arteries into stiff, unintentional self-parody. Let&apos;s hope the next Allen movie marks a return to high directorial ambition and low (as in &quot;no&quot;) acting profile.",

      "reviewBody": "I caught this movie on Bravo last night and I asked myself why I never saw it earlier. It was a true story about an Italian socialite named Kuki Gallman. The movie begins with her out on the town with friends and they have a car accident. As Kuki was recovering from the accident, she begins to wonder if there is any purpose in life out there and if so, what is it? It was like the accident was a major turning point, wake-up call or something that made her yearn for something more than what she had. She falls in love and marries this man who is going to Africa to live on a ranch. Kuki remembered learning about Africa as a child and against her mother&apos;s better judgement, she packs up herself and child and moves to Kenya. We see that she is going through many transitions and adjustments from the gleeming socialite to the devastating wiles of Kenya. We hear her say that she wondered what she had gotten herself in to. This was a woman who was chasing poachers, caring for a ranch and having to do a lot on her own as her husband was gone often, nothing that she had grown acustomed to in Italy. However, we saw her grow as a person and as she was growing, she was fufilling what she desired, life with a little bit of meaning. It was tragic when her husband and son both died and so close in time. However, it is people like Kuki who should be appreciated as they work for the good of others and try to make this world a better place. I saw the differences in Kuki from beginning to end as she dealt with frustrations, growing pains and all ingredients that prepare us for our purpose out there. Something I can completely relate to at this point in my own life. \n\nI thought the acting was great, Kim Basinger did an exceptional job. I thought the music was great; I liked the version of &quot;The Rivers of Babylon&quot; and the shots of Kenya that are breathtaking. I have two friends from Africa and my mother did some mission work there three years ago so I have learned about some of the culture and way of life there. Africa is dry and hot but beautiful as well. Kudos to all involved in this movie and to Kuki Gallman for sharing her story."

      "name": "An entertaining meeting of the Victorian era and the swinging sixties",
      "reviewBody": "JULES VERNE&apos;S ROCKET TO THE MOON is immediately misleading on two out of three points. Firstly, as the opening credits swiftly admit, while the plot is inspired by the general writings of Verne, it is not in fact based on any particular story that he actually wrote, which makes the attribution somewhat spurious. Secondly, while there is a rocket in the film, it becomes increasingly apparent as the movie progresses that it is in no actual danger of going anywhere near the moon.\n\nHaving cleared up the situation with the misleading title, one can sit back and enjoy an amusing romp that, despite its Victorian setting, is unique to the films produced in the swinging sixties. The typically contrived plot concerns a suddenly bankrupt Phineas T. Barnum (Burl Ives) making an escape from his creditors to England, where he becomes the prime mover in a plan to launch a rocket to the moon. On the side of the angels are a German explosives expert (Gert Fröbe), an idealistic young American (Troy Donahue) with a revolutionary rocket design and the well intentioned Duke of Barset (Dennis Price). Up to no good are an unscrupulous financier (Terry Thomas), an egotistical engineer (Lionel Jeffries) and a Russian spy (Joachim Teege). In characteristic fashion, it is around the central framework of the plot that all the amusing vignettes of the film are built. Terry Thomas&apos; &quot;economical&quot; motor car, and Gert Fröbe&apos;s explosive experiments to find the right amount of lift to get the rocket into space are two humorous recurring bits.\n\nThe film boasts another trademark of films of this era: a large cast filled with familiar faces. Gert Fröbe is great fun in his role as the fireproof Professor Von Bulow. Burl Ives, Terry Thomas and Lionel Jeffries also deliver the goods with their performances, though to be fair, their roles really require them to do little more than play upon already well established screen personas. The gorgeous Daliah Lavi is, well, gorgeous, as the female lead, which is pretty much all her part really calls for. Hermione Gingold, who amazingly is billed fourth in the credits, barely has time to deliver a performance in her five minutes on screen.\n\nDennis Price is fine in a part that has a fair amount of screen time, but really doesn&apos;t require him to do much. Seeing Price in such undemanding roles is always a little sad when one remembers his brilliant turn in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS. However Price&apos;s performance in ROCKET TO THE MOON is positively dynamic when compared to that of his American co-star, and supposedly the film&apos;s leading man, Troy Donahue. Donahue is one of the many handsome Hollywood hunks of the era, who looked great, but couldn&apos;t act their way out of a paper bag and he brings exactly that level of skill to his performance here. When surrounded by such a colourful cast it becomes painfully apparent just how out of his depth Donahue is.\n\nJULES VERNE&apos;S ROCKET TO THE MOON is occasionally laugh out loud funny, but mainly delivers grins, smirks and guffaws. Unlike such similar and overlong fare as THE GREAT RACE, THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES or AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, it keeps itself brief, does not wear out its welcome and makes for an ideal film to watch on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nUnfortunately, ROCKET TO THE MOON has been released in America on home video in only in pan and scan in a long out of print VHS release (under the ridiculous title THOSE FANTASTIC FLYING FOOLS). It is available in the UK in a quite acceptable 2.35:1 widescreen DVD release.",

I could not sleep properly after watching this movie especially the scene where Adam is playing violin and watching his wife and daughter being led away to gas chamber and howling in the night due to immense agony.. also, the scene in the cemetery where he cries and eats the flower and mud of the grave of his daughter.... Surprised why this movie is not considered for Oscar awards...",
