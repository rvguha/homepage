Come to find out they would take 50% of our paid fare and the refund for 2 people who went and didnt get to go on the whale tour was $23 ( what a joke, especially we asked numerous times the sales person at their ticket booth about there refund policy) So we went anyway and the team was nice on the boat. They dropped as off for 4 hr at Friday Harbor with nothing to do and most of the stores closed for the season and all the tours were booked. Not impressed with the customer service we got from this company. Also the weather was sunny and easy going. We felt ripped off and will never recommend this company to anyone."

        "reviewBody": "After spending days sightseeing in the city of Seattle, we were looking for a more \"natural\" type of Seattle adventure.  This 12 hour trip was just that.  After spending about 4 hours on their ferry we reached San Juan Island where many people disembarked.  Then we were off for our 2 1/2 hour whale watching adventure.  We first saw a hump back whale, and in the next few hours saw 9 killer whales, and one baby calf.  At oone point four of the whales were all in line shooting their spray up in to the air, and from my viewpoint, it was as if they were putting on a show for us!    The whales appeared over and over again.  We couldn't have been happier.\n\nWe saw a bald eagle, sea lions, porpoises, and many other creatures native to this area.\n\nWhen we returned to San Juan Island for our 2 1/2 hour land break, we were greeted with a parade put on by local farmers.   Some of the farmers were tossing out candies while others handed out candy.  One child who appeared to be about 5 years old was walking the parade route carrying a live chicken.   This parade was not like the kind of parade I am used to seeing in NYC.  It's simplicity was magical, as was the rest of the day!\n\nLastly, the naturalist onboard our ferry, Lauren, was amazing.  Her love of the whales and her job was obvious from start to finish.  \n\nI only hope that if you go on this tour, you are as lucky as we were!"

We were told that they had seen whales every day since March with three exceptions.  We spent 20 minutes watching deer on the side of the hill.  I convinced my husband to go on this cruise.  It was the final day of our trip and this was supposed to be the grand finale.  Horrible experience."

It was a regular ferry to San Juan from Seattle, with a stop over of several hours, it seems they have discovered a way of making more money out of their customers by, advertising as whale watching. The ferry drops customers at San Juan then heads out into the bay, for brief search for whales, as the ferry was so large we were also restricted as to how close we could get to the whales. After about 30 mins, and a brief sighting, of 1 whale tail. We headed back to San Juan, for a hour half stop over, pleasant town. The advertised whale watching was a joke. Trip took over 12 hours, complete waste of 1 of our precious days in Seattle. If you want to whale watching choose another company."

This day was really more about the trip than the destination.  I sat outside on the top level, yes it was cold, but I didnt come on the boat to sit in a \"fish bowl\" and look out a window.  When we saw the whales, they were far away and hard to see with so many passengers trying to take photos. I also could do without the 2 hour layover and would have rather headed back. All in all I enjoyed the day, the ride and the people I met, but if you're wanting to see whales close up, you will be disappointed."

Along the way there really is nothing to look at as far as seals, or sea lions....and definitely no whales.  We dropped off some people at Friday Harbor and then left to find whales...they explain that there is no guarantee....and it is strictly done by communication with others in the area.  We did see the tops of whales...not a whole whale...and we had to stay so far away from them the event that we had all been looking forward to was really a let down.  Then we went back to Friday Harbor, which was super cute and very nice.  Again, back on the boat for another 3 hour ride back to Seattle.  The weather was beautiful and we did see a couple of dolphins...this trip is extremely high for what you get.  The ship is comfortable, however, the food selection while good was limited and they ran out of some of the favorite items.  No effort in Friday Harbor was made to replenish the food for the ride back to Seattle.  So, if you do not purchase food in Friday Harbor or bring some onboard, you will be hungry because you arrive back in Seattle at 8 p.m.  If you have an Uber account, you will need to call an Uber to come and get you at the waterfront.  We found two taxis but they were down a ways from the docking point.  Buses don't run at the waterfront after 8 p.m. The Pike Place Market was also closed.  So, plan accordingly.  Also, a note to parents, please do not bring chldren on this cruise that are under 10.....the cruise is very long....even for adults.  And, we had a baby on the cruise, who screamed and cried the entire cruise.....dampening the mood for everyone.  Would definitely hope that parents would realize being on a boat for 10 hours is alot to ask for kids.  Would not book this cruise again.  A whale watching cruise usually includes sitings of whales.....not just fins and blow holes.....was hoping to see whales.  The staff was extraordinary and did a great job!"

It is quite a long day: we left at 8:15 a.m  & returned at 8 pm. I believe it is the only whale watching tour out of Seattle. A few tips: get a seat inside as we were outside on top of the boat all day. (A bit too much wind). The people inside weren't very willing to make room for us.ðŸ˜¬ Also, the online info said to arrive 1 hour early to check in (7:15 a m.). No way! When we arrived that early, they told us to go get a coffee & come back in ~ 30 minutes! ðŸ˜². Otherwise, we did really love the trip. The stop on San Juan Island was nice. Enjoyed the Whale museum & ordered dinner to go from a restaurant near the harbor."

Cheryl was a wonderful guide who provided us with a lot of interesting history and information about the area on the way to and from the mountain. It was a refreshing change of pace from the larger group tours we have taken in the past because we were able to have a real conversation with the tour guide. It felt like we were spending the day with an old friend or family member who has lived in the area for a long time. The gondola ride to the top of Crystal Mountain was relaxing, and we had great views of the surrounding mountains with our lunch. We were not rushed at all and had ample time to enjoy the wonderful views of Mt. Rainier, which was clearly visible on the day we visited. For those wanting a change of pace from the \"standard\" tour format, I would highly recommend this tour!"

Besides the wine tasting, the trip back and forth from Seattle was a great part of the experience as we really enjoyed the scenery and learning a little about the different Washington  landscapes and climates between Seattle and Eastern Washington (desert area)."

Whatever their age, however fussy your little ones can be with food and in spite of the rain that might fall, thereâ€™s always something that will keep the whole family happy! Seattle is packed with interactive museums, opportunities to get active outdoors by canoeing or exploring Discovery Park and the Native American Cultural Centre, and rainy day options like the Aquarium. So let a local show you the family side of this dynamic, modern city so you can make new memories and create the perfect family break!\n\nOur handpicked hosts are culinary connoisseurs and history buffs, bakers and bankers, students and seniors. Like the people who travel with us, they have different backgrounds and interests â€“ but theyâ€™re all so passionate about the place they call home, they choose to spend their free time sharing it with the like-minded travelers matched to them.\n",

I was notified that our host was being briefed on March 3rd and I was contacted by March 4th.  Details were exchanged and a proposed itinerary was received on March 15th.  We paid $976 for this 4 hour tour and I was told that our \"budget\" for food for the 6 of us was $213.  The itinerary included 3 stops where we were expected to order off the menu and share.  Transportation between restaurants was not included.  I asked our host what their recommendations were (why those particular restaurants were selected) and commented that making 3 reservations, being responsible for our own transportation, and ordering off the menu/sharing was something we could have just done on our own.  On the morning of March 17th - ONE DAY BEFORE OUR TOUR - I received notification that our tour was canceled \"due to COVID\" (which isn't being honest, IMO).  What horrible service."

Absolute lack of professionalism and regard to their customers. Again would not recommend this company at all."

For $60 you get 10 wine tastings (your choice from 25+ wineries around the seattle area) and $50 in Lyft credit (5 rides, $10 off each ride).  The Wine Passport was very user friendly - you just download the app and select the 10 wineries you would like to visit.  When you arrive at the winery, you hit \"redeem\" and show it to the person pouring wine.  9 of the 10 wineries we visited knew about the app and there were no issues redeeming.  The one who didnt know about it, just said ok and gave us our tasting.  :)  \n\nThe wineries in Woodenville were awesome! Some were smaller and close together, and others were larger and far apart.  You can walk between a lot of them!  Our favorite winery we visited was Novelty Hill Januik - they had a huge wine list and you could select any 6 wines to sample!  Also, you do not have to use all the tastings in the same day, you can spread them out over a weekend or longer.  Same with the lyft rides. \n\nIf your visiting Seattle, or if you live in Seattle, you have got to try the Wine Passport!  Not only is it a great deal, its a great time with friends, drinking great wine!  "

She had a very clean and well organized kitchen, offered tea as well as Japanese candies, and all of the sushi making experience needed to educate some beginners! The walk to the fish market was lovely, Fumiko shared her knowledge of the history of the area. The fish market was clean and had all the tools required to make sushi at home. The sushi instructions were easy to follow and more importantly, delicious! A great way to spend the late morning with my boyfriend and brother and his girlfriend. The small size of the class ensured everyone got to know one another and made it more fun! Highly recommend."

Puget Sound is very picturesque.The trip was on time, and wharf is in the heart of Seattle, unlike the airport.  Strongly recommend this trip"

    "description": "Come sailing on Seattleâ€™s Tall Ship, a historic 19th-century style gaff-rigged schooner. We offer three public sailing tours daily from Seattleâ€™s downtown waterfront. Our beautiful sailing ship, the Bay Lady, evokes the romance of traditional sailing as we work together to set the sails, turn off the engine, and sail off into an age of cannon fire and sunsets behind the untouched mountain ranges of the Puget Sound. \n\nBay Lady is the largest public sailing vessel in Seattle. With her high railing and comfortable seating, she is the premier boat ride for families. \n\nEnjoy a drink from our onboard bar and set sail into the perfect day on the water!\n",

Captain Noah and the entire team go above in beyond in their customer service to ensure everyone has the best time. There are some other sailing tours and they are good too, but service is everything and they truly want you to have the best time on board. Seating is very comfortable and spacious. If you get the chance to book the Sunday brunch cruise, DO IT!!!! I always take friends and family who come to town on this cruise as it really shows Seattle beauty. From downtown skyline's to the Olympic mts. and everything in between, I give this cruise a 12/10."

    "description": "Join us up in the Melrose Market Loft surrounded by exposed brick, Douglas fir beams, and dark wood library. We'll be providing a full 'mocktail bar' (cold non-alcoholic beverages), and we'll be popping corn on the stove top. Additionally, you'll have access to a tea lab in the loft where you can custom blend your own cup.\n\nLook forward to finishing off your evening in a relaxing environment with down-to-earth conversation and lighthearted rivalry in a vibrant indoor open air market. To begin with, I will show you around the 'mocktail lab' for you to concoct your own drinks. Then pick your seat at the table. We can have several different activities going on at once, so if the puzzle or a certain game isn't your thing, we'll just round up some extra people and start another! We have a variety of classic board games, playing cards and puzzles. If you have a different game or puzzle in mind, feel free to bring it along to share.",

Hear fascinating facts about Seattleâ€™s waterways and grab some group photos with a gorgeous backdrop of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains.\n\nFrom the waterfront, weâ€™ll head to Seattleâ€™s most popular attraction, Pike Place Market, where your tour guide will help you navigate to the best places to eat in the market. Grab some creamy chowder or a fresh brewed cup of coffee as we pass by the notorious Gum Wall, see the oldest Starbucks, and wait for fish to fly!\n",
