      "reviewBody": "*Diary of a Country Priest*  is a nearly perfect film.  Made in 1950, this film benefits from Bresson being at the height of his powers.  As he aged, the slow, measured, static style became more and more mannered, or more and more intolerable, shall we say.  But here he doesn&apos;t go overboard:  the mood is portentous rather than pretentious.  And in any case, it&apos;s not as slow as you may think:  there are probably hundreds of cuts in the film  (this ain&apos;t no Carl Th. Dreyer movie).  Along those lines, Bresson&apos;s method of adaptation -- which is to distill the ESSENCE of the chosen work -- is stringently economical and pared to the bone.  In other words, the thing doesn&apos;t simply dawdle along.  Based on a 1930&apos;s novel by a right-wing Euro novelist, *Diary*  details the sad experiences of a young priest with health problems who is assigned to a new parish.  The villagers treat the young man with hostility and downright scorn.  Sensing and resenting the new priest&apos;s obvious holiness  (everybody hates a saint), they ridicule him, shut him out of their confidences, send threatening anonymous notes  (&quot;I feel sorry for you, but GET OUT&quot;) . . . to all of which our hero responds with a sort of confused empathy.  Meanwhile, Bresson uses a striking narrative device:  we see the priest writing in his diary, while VOICING OVER what he&apos;s writing, and then there&apos;s a cut to a scene which SHOWS the action the priest has just been writing  (and narrating)  about.  This complex, layered style proves to be more than a fair trade-off for the paucity of actual narrative incidents. We&apos;re invited to ponder an event&apos;s significance -- a lucky thing, because the action is quite often so psychologically complex that we need room to breathe, to think things over.  Don&apos;t presume to form an opinion of  *Diary* until you&apos;ve seen it at least twice.  Sounds like homework, I know, but so does  *King Lear*.  Great art IS homework.\n\nPerhaps the film&apos;s true value is its delineation of just how stagnant and unpleasant little towns can be.  Again Bresson is inventive:  rather than simply show us the putrid little village, the director instead opts for an oblique approach, inviting us to IMAGINE just how putrid the village actually is, usually by heightening off-screen sound effects.  Quite often, we hear unpleasant things like motorcycles backfiring, rakes running over asphalt, crows screeching, mean-spirited giggling outside a window, iron gates slamming shut, and so on.\n\nAnd finally, it must be said that it&apos;s surprising how avowed agnostic directors make the most persuasive religious movies.  In my view, this film and Dreyer&apos;s  *Ordet*  remain the greatest films about Christianity in the history of cinema  (the conversion scene in the middle of  *Diary*  might prompt you to go to church next Sunday).  Anyway, *Diary of a Country Priest*  is an unassailable, influential masterpiece that&apos;s a MUST-OWN for the true cineaste, and a possible education in art for everybody else.  Get the new Criterion edition, watch it twice, and listen to Peter Cowie&apos;s commentary.  I assure you that it won&apos;t be a waste of your time.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1911, 17-year-old Elsie Ferguson gives up her daughter to an adoption agency. She is told she will never be able to find out where the baby goes to. We cut, and it&apos;s Miss Ferguson&apos;s office door. She&apos;s a lawyer now, fending off the amatory advances of John Halliday. She does agree to go to a night club with him. We cut to a night club, where Marian Nixon is in a spangly, short dress, sits at a table telling boyfriend Grant Withers she won&apos;t marry him. She then gets up and is the lead dancer in a well-shot chorus number.\n\nAnyone who&apos;s seen these things is pretty sure how things are going to turn out in the end. The question is: how do we get there? We find out when Withers and Miss Nixon show up at Miss Ferguson&apos;s office. Will she defend the girl against the charge of murdering her father? By the end of this scene, Halliday shows up. He&apos;s the District Attorney, and he arrests Miss Nixon.\n\nThe rest of the movie is a courtroom drama. As usual, there&apos;s a considerable gap between what goes on in a real court room and what goes on here. As usual, Fred Kelsey shows up as a dumb cop, giving testimony. As usual, there&apos;s a Surprising Secret revealed, which will come as no surprise to the audience. And as usual, there&apos;s a reconciliation at the end which takes place way too fast and easily.\n\nMiss Ferguson is pretty good in the scenes that make sense, with a realistic hauteur that might have provided her a good living in Agnes Moorhead-style roles, had she needed them. She didn&apos;t. She never made another.",

Unfortunately, he left out the milestones, those transitions a character makes, inwardly, as outward events bear in on them. The audience is asked to make gigantic leaps of logic as the character&apos;s trust in and dependence on Love changes, evolves with age. Mind you this is a three hour epic, so it is not for want of time that the production misses the mark, only the screenwriter&apos;s discipline, and here, again, the director got involved where he ought not be.",

      "reviewBody": "Duniya Na Maane / Kunku (1937) : Brief Review -\n\nAn astounding combination of A Woman&apos;s Revolt agianst oppressed marriage and A Man&apos;s Salvation on the same. The Greatest Woman Empowerment Saga Of All Time. I didn&apos;t believe it for a moment that V Shantaram made such a daring film in 1937 that hasn&apos;t been dared by other Indian filmmakers even till date, but as i have seen Duniya Na Maane i have to believe and do nothing but clap for the Master Filmmaker. Duniya Na Maane is a gutsy film for all times, not just its time and can you believe that less daring films than this are still called daring films then just imagine how daring this film was, is and will always be. The film is a worthy adaption of evergreen Sangeet Sharda which focuses on the issues like child marriage and treatment of women in Indian society. Nirmala is trapped into marrying an old widower Kakasaheb. Neera refuses to consummate the union claiming that while suffering can be borne, injustice cannot. She stands still till the end and revolts against everyone who throw her into this helpless situation and then the intellectual salvation of the man lifts this film to unreachable height. Shanta Apte gives a remarkable performance in the lead role. She looks beautiful in traditional attires and is even referred as Greta Garbo of Maharashtra in the film. When she sings the iconic &apos;Psalm of Life&apos;, i was literally pumped up. Screenplay is impeccable with lots of clapworthy and pathbreaking scenes, dialogues are thought-provoking and music album delivers two Iconic songs. Words will fall short to admire V Shantaram for making this unforgettable masterpiece but all i can say is, i have seen Woman Oriented Classics like Aurat, Mother India, Anuradha, Sujatha and many more and i still found Duniya Na Maane more gutsy and more powerful which means it&apos;s best of All Time not just in Marathi or Bollywood cinema but in Indian Cinema. An Astonishing Gem!\n\nRATING - 9/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "Amusing return to the classic series created by Stephen J Cannell , also here as producer along with Ridley Scott , with an appropriate cast and overwhelming C.G. special effects . Excellent homage to the entertaining episodes with a complex intrigue but following the canon and overemphasis on usual characterization and special effects . A new entry of the mythical series of ¬®A Team¬® , this time written and directed by Joe Carnahan , the creator of the successful film titled &quot;Smokin&apos;s aces&quot; and many others ; here is developed the first meeting between Annibal Smith , and his pals . While on the lam, they became heroes for hire, working as good-guy vigilantes around the US or the world . At the end of their stint in Irak Col. John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith ( Liam Neeson in the role of the deceased George Peppard) and his team were framed for stealing some plates (which they had done, but under orders). The operative group is sent on an assignment to recover plates for printing 100 dollar bills that were utilized to print a billion dollars. After making the mission and returning to the base their commanding General (Gerald McRaney) is murdered in a blow up and the plates are robbed and they are condemned to an US and Germany military prison . They escaped and went on the run, pursued by Captain , later degraded Lieutenant Sosa (Jessica Biel). Hannibal Smith was their chief and an expert at disguises . Templeton Faceman (Bradley Cooper substituting Dirk Benedict) was the team&apos;s con artist and lady&apos;s man . M.A. Baracus (Quinton Rampage Jackson replacing Mr T) with extreme panic to flight , he was their mechanic , but also took care of mayhem and intimidation . The final member of the Team , &quot;Howling Mad&quot; Murdock (Sharlto Copley similar role to Dwight Schulz), was an expert but nutty pilot, and a certified lunatic , but they broke him out of a mental hospital whenever they needed him for a dangerous mission. \n\nThis entertaining story is concentrated on known characters as well as thrill-packed action and special effects although there&apos;re numerous of that too . The movie has unstopped ,tension, comedy , emotion, suspense and sensational scenarios like is customary development of the franchise . Spectacular , exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new cinematic outing of ¬®A Team¬® , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Humor , thrills , several agreeable characters and trademark effects abound and will please the series enthusiasts such as the neophyte .\n\nThe agreeable acting convinces , especially the leader Liam Neeson , the sympathetic Bradley Cooper and Brian Bloom in a super-villain role , while other players also make a nice work as Patrick Wilson and the gorgeous Jessica Biel. And of course , special appearance in brief cameos from Dwight Schulz and Dirk Benedict , though doesn&apos;t appear Mr. T. The moving final amazing the spectator , in which the stirring and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . It is the rebirth of the series, an enjoyable homage , the start of a new scenario . Fans of the series may find much to love , but others will be bewildered by excessive and breathtaking situations .

Actually, it was more than tolerable, it was actually fairly good, not the acting, by any stretch of the imagination, but it served its purpose. In my opinion, it&apos;s a great movie to watch on a slow/rainy weekend evening. I went into this film with little to no expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised. I was sure by the reviews that it would be terrible, instead I found myself thoroughly satisfied. While TIC is no &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, it&apos;s of the same genre. Spoiled rich kids, doing bad things to each other and sucking in the lowly outsider in the process.\n\n&quot;In Crowd&quot; has the same atmosphere and draw as any soap opera today, but the cheesy drama of soaps seems to translate well to a certain niche, but it DOES have a niche. Expect nothing more than a two hour version of &quot;All My Children&quot; and you won&apos;t end this film angry. I say give it a chance. If anything it&apos;ll end up on your guilty pleasures list.",

      "reviewBody": "Brescia&apos;s third film is yet another peplum film that touches somewhat familiar territory but manages to pull off very well the same spirit of fun and light adventure present in some of the greater examples of the genre. His own take on the myth of Hercules seems rather derivative, kind of what we have seen in Hercules at the Conquest of Atlantis (1961) but done in a much less polished and notably cheaper way, leaving behind almost all mythic lore and opting for a rather self contained new sci-fi/fantasy background for the lost civilization. Because of this, Heracles feels less mighty than Hercules but his struggles and journey are almost as effective.\n\nIncredibly well-paced, action driven, colorful and magnificently psychotronic. This is an interesting piece of peplum cinema that serves as a curious addition even if it&apos;s not new territory at all. You can tell this is early Brescia as there are some seeds but he hasn&apos;t fully gotten to the highpoint of pulpy cinematic sublimity he reached during his space movie cycle.",

Inspired! All the scenes are set in and around the building site. Custer makes his last stand, horses gallop past modern caf√©s, the familiar Parisian architecture rings the pit, and a Pinkerton agent Pinkerton himself) walks around in modern dress.

Of course since die-hard fans of Oceans 11 (such as myself) will have to see this movie even if it is to just believe how bad it really is its a no brainer for the producers to dish any hogwash onto our plates - its a well thought of commercial strategy but very cold blooded and callous on the fans. Its extremely painful to sit through - the best performance is by Matt Damon in one particular scene which is the highest point the movie ever reaches -I hope they make an Oceans 13 and really think of a nice story this time around as a sort of apology for their bad behavior this time - or bring out an apology to all the fans they conned!"

      "reviewBody": "Englishman Walter Byron -- with nary a British accent -- is imprisoned for killing his father. He escapes, and is reputed to have died in a plane crash. In reality, he has fled to America, where he has made a fortune in the Oklahoma oil fields. A field fire sent him to a plastic surgeon, who gave him a new face. So he returns to the Old Manor to discover who really killed his father. He finds the place bankrupt and in possession of the Crown, his father&apos;s widow Natalie Moorhead hoping that the resulting sale will raise enough money to allow her to move to the south of France, and his ex-fiancee, Bette Davis, assisting the fellow representing the crown. Other noteworthy members of the cast include H. B. Warner, and Oscar Apfel.\n\nIt was a terrible copy I looked at, likely one drawn from a multi-generational copy of a SLP VHS tape. As a result, I could derived very little of its visual quality; the director, Roy William Neill, was among the better of the Columbia directors at this point, indulging in some of the visual glosses that would form the basis of film noir. However, given the fuzziness and distortion, who knows? Likewise, the cast seems to be trapped in one of those creaky, old British mysteries, with an isolated manor, comic characters, and everyone under suspicion except Miss Davis, lead Arthur Byron -- who seemed to be indistinguishable from Edmund Lowe given the quality of the picture -- and Halliwell Hobbes as the Old Faithful Retainer.\n\nI looked at it, of course, because Bette Davis has a role in it. Given the dullness of the movie, I am unlikely to look at it again.",

Steve Guttenberg is great here too, who also adapted this to film and directed it. I am suprised it wasn&apos;t released by a bigger studio! The credits dedicate the film to SAL MINEO!!

Like the films of Lynne Ramsey, the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving. Because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop-cult. story lines, this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film I have seen (also, see Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Look Now&quot; gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. That film, like L&apos;Homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. If you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of cinema, you&apos;ll love this movie.",

If you come away with this same observation then asked yourself what sets you apart from any immigrant group. They want what you want, and they have the same needs. The differences between them and US citizens will evaporate in a single generation.\n\nThe Haitian hate groups should be ashamed of their behavior, but no more than any American-first organization. We live in the same world, we breath the same air, and we share a common DNA. And like the Xenophobic Haitians, you benefit from the labor of immigrants.\n\nThe son of an immigrant woman",

My body was brought to a hospital, not a house (as in this movie), and the work was done by medical professionals (not as in this movie). The year was 2005, ten full years before this movie was made.\n\nLet&apos;s skip the discussion of the after-death and re-integration experience issue; leave it for another time and place. And, I don&apos;t want to write a spoiler.\n\nThe fact is I&apos;m alive and healthy today, and I have all (or at least most) of my memories. I&apos;m writing this review. Aside from a nurse welcoming me back as &quot;a member of the walking dead - don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s more of you every day&quot; (I&apos;m presuming she was just being a wise-ass), there&apos;s nothing creepy or even dramatic about the experience. Profound, yes. But, as the nurse noted, this has become a daily phenomenon. There aren&apos;t riots in the streets, and people aren&apos;t agonizing over it. The practitioners aren&apos;t losing sleep about it or worrying about becoming pariahs.\n\nTechnically, the movie is OK, it&apos;s just that the premise is, well, way out of date. That effectively drains most of the real drama from the film.",

This go around it surrounds a girl who&apos;s being haunted by her dead family. They want revenge and the only way they can achieve it is by this young lass to help out. There&apos;s more back-story, with some mystery involved, but that&apos;s basically the plot.\n\nThe story itself surprisingly was pretty fun. There were some lulls, but nothing that&apos;ll bore you so much that you&apos;ll shut it off or skip the scene. Regardless of a slow part here and there, the story was directed well, and with the awesome violence thrown in, it turned out to be a very fun Ittenbach flick.

Incredible portraits of people (in this case men) who have itches that they just can&apos;t scratch! In one scene the &quot;hero&quot; listens to the ex-Nazi make some crack about Jesse Owens getting the gold medal and he says,&quot;..so you wouldn&apos;t have stood on the platform next to a black man?&quot; and I thought, &quot;I would give anything to see an American movie with a conversation as half as real as this!&quot; You think Wenders is boring?

      "reviewBody": "Hardly Working (1980) \n\n1/2 (out of 4) \n\nBo Hooper (Jerry Lewis) is a life long clown who finds himself out of work after the circus goes out of business. He ends up moving in with his sister and brother-in-law until he can find a job. He&apos;s able to get one job after another but he is quickly fired because he just isn&apos;t too bright. He eventually lands a job at the post office but his boss (Roger C. Carmel) hates him and that hatred grows even stronger when the boss finds out that Bo is dating his daughter (Susan Oliver).\n\nHARDLY WORKING turned out to be the first Jerry Lewis film in a decade because THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED ended up never getting released. This &quot;comeback&quot; film had all sorts of problems including the production being shut down for several months because not enough money could be raised. The result on film is pretty bad on a number of levels but one of the biggest is the fact that the comedy just doesn&apos;t have many laughs that actually work. The production issues also how because the first half dealing with the brother-in-law is completely missing in the second half.\n\nThe first portion of the movie is basically just one poor skit after another. We see Lewis attempting to do various jobs with all of them ending in disaster. This includes one sequence involving him working at a gas station where he ends up destroying a car. The second portion of the movie gets away from the skit platform and deals with the romance with the girl. The problem is that these two different types of movies don&apos;t mix well together but the bigger issue is the fact that there aren&apos;t many laughs. The comedy is very forced but the direction by Lewis is less than impressive.\n\nRoger Ebert really trashed this movie and called it one of the worst American films he ever saw. I wouldn&apos;t go that far but there&apos;s no question that Lewis was trying to recapture a former magic and it just doesn&apos;t work. The start of HARDLY WORKING has clips from previous Lewis movies as if he was trying to show people how funny he was at one time. Sadly there are very few laughs here and in the end it&apos;s quite forgettable and rather sad."

      "reviewBody": "There is a big problem with this movie -- aside from the unecessary and distracting use of the split screen, a passing fad ripped off from Warhol&apos;s Chelsea Girls.  The first half is an almost flawless police procedural.  It doesn&apos;t stick to historical facts all that much.  Bottomly was a political nobody whose main job was to keep the public thinking that something was being done.  The second half deals with Albert DeSalvo the man and is pretty much hyped up and fictional.  It turns from a good docudrama into a standard piece of Hollywood baloney.  Not a reflection on Tony Curtis&apos;s performance. He&apos;s better here than in most of his performances, some of which -- Some Like It Hot and The Outsider -- are pretty good.  But, first, there is a lot of controversy surrounding the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder. MPD is when two or more whole and integrated personalities inhabit the same body.  It may or may not be &quot;real&quot; and in any case is easily faked.  And DeSalvo didn&apos;t &quot;have it.&quot;  I don&apos;t mean to harp on the issue of historical accuracy.  Sometimes, as in Shakespeare in Love, it really doesn&apos;t matter much, but in this case it does because it&apos;s used as a deus ex machina that resolves all the questions the actual facts raise.  Interviews with DeSalva make it clear that he knew exactly what he was doing when he was doing it. And he didn&apos;t need help in remembering the facts.  He recalled all of the details, including the state of his penis, while he committed the murders. The film changes history and turns him into just another dramatic case of MPD.  Nothing is said about his admission that he was also a criminal rapist known to the police as &quot;the green man,&quot; who, in the guise of a talent scout, went around measuring girl&apos;s busts and hips, thousands of them by his admission.  The film also leaves out any reference to his escape from jail and his subsequent recapture wearing a sailor&apos;s uniform.  He never had the anxiety attack shown in the film.  He never went over the edge into irredeemable psychosis.  Any competent shrink in reviewing the case would diagnose the real Boston strangler as a socialized type of anti-social personality disorder, the kind of illness that used to be called &quot;psychopath.&quot;  He was a con man, pure and simple.  The ending is dramatic but it&apos;s nothing but fictional trash designed to lull an unthinking audience into the belief that even the most loathsome and darkest aspect of human nature has a comprehensible explanation.  The twisting of fact is understandable, however.  The real, historical explanation, or the lack of it, would give not only the Boston strangler but all the rest of us an anxiety attack.  Some people commit thoroughly rotten acts -- and none of the rest of us knows why."

The love story is sweet, and the chaste Eve is treated in a respectful way, but the script wasn&apos;t funny, the supporting characters were not funny. George Dzundza, who I remember fondly from his Law and Order days, was wasted in this film. The male lead seemed too stoned and apathetic to care about anyone.

      "name": "What that Revolution really needed were two good female revolutionaries",
      "reviewBody": "This was an amusing film, which was the first movie that I saw starring either Bridget Bardot or Jeanne Moreau. I actually saw it on a double bill back in 1965. It is of interest because it brings up a matter that American films about Mexico&apos;s Revolution (or that of the other Latin American Countries) rarely touch upon. This is the position of the Roman Catholic Church in these matters.\n\nThe only time the issue of the Church and the Revolutionaries came up in American films was in the John Ford / Henry Fonda movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. That (based on Graham Greene&apos;s novel &quot;The Power And The Glory&quot;)dealt with the anti-Clericalism of the PRI regimes that ruled the country after 1920. In it Fonda is a fugitive priest who is trying to continue his religious role, despite the anti-clericalism of the regime. Greene (and Ford) were good Catholics, and stressed the negative actions of the revolutionary regime in Mexico (similar to the anti-religious viewpoint of the Communist regime in Russia). But the view barely notes why the anti-Clericalism developed.\n\nOne of the largest land owning groups in Mexico (and in most of Latin America&apos;s countries) was the Church. And, due to the holdings, the Church tended to be rather conservative politically. In the 19th Century the greatest figure of reform in Mexico was Benito Juarez, who was from a poor native Indian background. But most of his career was in trying to strengthen Mexican democratic government, and to drive the French invasion (that briefly set up Archduke Maximillian of Austria) as Emperor. But after the French were driven out, Juarez spent the remainder of his years in office (1867 - 1872) trying to get through some kind of fair land reform. This did not sit well with the Church. It supported the regime of his successor (Porfirio Diaz), who was opposed to land reform - he invited foreign investors (many Americans) into Mexico. Diaz&apos;s policies were good in giving Mexico a stable economy and political peace for three decades (the longest growth period until the later 20th Century).\n\nThe key character to watch in &quot;Viva Maria&quot; is Francisco Regueira, who plays the sinister Father Superior. It is he who is constantly in communication with the dictator, the landowner, and their minions. The role (as is the film) is played for laughs, but it is his behavior, conspiring against the two Marias and their friends, which is telling.\n\nThe plot is interesting in bringing in the universality of revolution. Bardot is shown growing up, the daughter of an Irish revolutionary, constantly destroying British forts and other sites with his daughter assisting. When she joins forces with Moreau the latter&apos;s sister has committed suicide, so that she needs Bardot to replace the sister. It is a circus group, but Bardot and Moreau do a singing and strip-tease act. They are brought into the Mexican Revolution by the brutality of the local landowner (who rules like he has a mini-kingdom).\n\nThe film was pure escapism: the circus group&apos;s resident marksman finds one of his special rifles is badly bent after an explosion - he doesn&apos;t throw it out, but attach-es a mirror to the barrel and uses the bent gun to shoot people around the corner. George Hamilton plays a local &quot;Zapata&quot; type hero, who is wounded and in hiding. When Bardot speaks in his honor, the members of the circus group listen to her words comments critically on her use of language, and on his theatricality - as though she is acting on stage.\n\nIt is not a major film, even for director Louis Malle (don&apos;t compare it with &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, for example). But as an enjoyable romp it&apos;s worth watching.",

Think about life, death, love, friendship, human cruelty and speak about history. Like Tavianis have spoken about it. No, I am too emotional. OK, just watch it. And I think you&apos;ll feel the same, or may be different, but YOU FEEL. After the presentation one of the actors sad, that he had seen a lot of people crying during the screening. &quot;Crying is not enough, we have to speak&quot; he sad.

Even his younger brother is not far from going into the same tracks.\n\nThen a struck of luck, if you could call it that, hits Ku Dong, a crime syndicate kidnaps him in order to train him to pass the police admission exam. It&apos;s something they have been doing for a while, sneaking moles in the police force to protect their leader, and making it easier to do dirty jobs here and there. The training of Ku Dong is both painful and hilarious, a very black humour that seems to be something natural for Korean cinema The thing is, Ku Dong really wanted to be in the force, at first just as an excuse to keep beating people, but eventually starts to realize this is his chance to give his life a real purpose.\n\nMr Socrates is not particularly original or &quot;different&quot; in terms of the genre, and it will be inevitable for many to compare it with everything from Ritchie/Tarantino stuff (almost a default practice with any crime/gritty movie made in the last years, ironic considering all the stuff Tarantino rips off from Asian cinema) to other Asian crime flicks of recent years. Neverless, the film manages to create it&apos;s own identity, and to be both funny and engaging without really pretending to be anything else. The story goes at a nice pacing, the performances are quite convincing, specially in the main lead. There&apos;s actually a transformation in the main character, and we can feel it. From an irresponsible thug to a person with a new found sense of direction in his life.\n\nSo, score one more for Korean genre cinema. While far from being the best of what the country, and the genre, can offer, i take this any day over many other poorly attempts of &quot;cool-crime/comedy&quot; flicks.",

Saimir is great, his father probably has the most difficult role, but he plays well. It&apos;s a movie that we should show in the school,once a year. We have to learn from Saimir,from his life.In Italy this movie had an important meaning, because there are some problems about people from Albania, but these are two hours where we can consider to solve them.In any case we are waiting for the next movie of Munzi, I wish with another interesting story.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Talent is considered worth measuring only when it occurs in the right body,&quot; the narrator announces as hundreds of children are paraded across the camera. Each child is aged 10-12 and is gleaned from an application pool of thousands, all hoping to be chosen by the illustrious Vaganova Choreographic Institute and Kirov Ballet.\n\nThe audition process as we see it is incredibly is rigorous, with children measured and chosen for the specific physical proportions deemed necessary for the ballet before even having a chance to show off their ability but, as this movie keenly illustrates, the audition is only the first step that they&apos;ll take in a lifetime of rigorous discipline if they are accepted.\n\nThe narrator is Princess Grace of Monaco, or Grace Kelly. Her calm, warm voice is a soothing addition to The Children of Theatre Street. Directed by Robert Dornhelm and Earle Mack, this academy award-nominated film was produced by a team made up of both Soviet and western filmmakers in 1977, right in the midst of communist power.\n\nBut the focus is not on the politics of the era. The focus here is on the children in the title. The documentary follows various students of the school throughout one year in their life, illustrating the life of a young ballerina in glorious detail. We see several students prepare for the performance that marks their graduation from the school, observe their activities and interactions, and find out just how much work ballerinas have to undertake in order to perfect their craft.\n\nWe also meet both the teachers and staff and hear a bit about the history of the Kirov Ballet while being treated to wonderful shots of St. Petersburg. The film can occasionally seem a little staged, perhaps because it was produced in the height of Soviet communist power, but the young ballerinas and the detail of their lives more than makes up for this.\n\nThe movie is about dedication and hard work. It is about the sweat and the tears that these students put into every day of their training and their lives. But it is also about the joy that lies in the dance for them. For the children of Theatre Street, ballet was everything. It was their life- and it was a life they were determined to live to the fullest.",

      "reviewBody": "As one fellow IMDb user stated, there are very few reviews in the grey area for &quot;Angels and Insects&quot;. However, I can honestly say that when I first saw the film in 1995 (I was about 12 at the time) I wasn&apos;t very impressed. From a very young age I have been interested in period films and thought provoking themes, however, upon first viewing I was incredibly bored by the whole project. \n\nFlash forward to 2003 and I found that I had a whole new appreciation for the film. As a matter of fact, it has become one of my favorites. I don&apos;t find the plot particularly shocking, however, the execution of the script is excellently paced. I like the fact that William Adamson realizes that beauty isn&apos;t necessarily exhibited on the outside. (However, I find Matty to be far more striking in appearance than Eugenia). He realizes that like his insects (ants in particular), the Alabaster family has a unique and questionable structure/nature. \n\nThe soundtrack, costumes, and use of light and location are superb. It isn&apos;t by accident that the costumes mimic some of the insects mentioned in the film. (For example, Eugenia&apos;s bee dress and her Morpho Eugenia sapphire gown). The Alabaster estate is quiet a piece of eye candy, as are the shots of insects set to the beautiful string based soundtrack. Though this use of symbolism may not be very original, it is beautiful just the same. \n\nI do have to come to the defense of some of the actors, however. Some comments mention that the acting is somewhat wooden. I tend to disagree. (Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course). Okay, so Patsy Kensit may not be the next Vanessa Redgrave, however, I think she offers what the part calls for. Her &quot;wooden&quot; nature fits the character. I see Eugenia as having a definite mental imbalance, thus her often subdued acting seems appropriate. Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as the clever and mysterious Matty. As for the rest of the cast, I believe that they all did a fine job portraying these somewhat difficult characters. \n\nI have yet to read the A.S. Byatt novella &quot;Morpho Eugenia&quot;, however, that is going to be my next project. Naturally, I would be curious to see how the film and the novella compare. Either way, I still feel that &quot;Angels and Insects&quot; deserves my highest regards."

      "reviewBody": "This film was effective in showing the scary nature of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the KGB, but it did nothing to help solve the murder of former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko. It is a kind of &quot;J&apos;accuse&quot; work that doesn&apos;t produce any evidence to back up its accusation besides presenting credible testimony about the corruption, brutality and even murderousness of FSB functionaries, and showing Litvinenko himself making a lot of these allegations on camera.\n\nBut this forms the entire basis of the film&apos;s case against Litvinenko&apos;s former FSB colleagues. There is no examination of how the polonium-210 wound up in Litvinenko&apos;s system. Andrei Lugovoy, who is now sought by the British police as a suspect, is interviewed, and talks about polonium-210. He and his monosyllabic sidekick do look rather creepy, but that is all, and when they offer the interviewer a cup of tea, there is a black comedy moment.\n\nThis is an indictment of Russia&apos;s &quot;Chekists&quot; (spooks), who supposedly run Russia as evidenced by the fact that one of their own, Vladimir Putin, is Russia&apos;s president. The logic runs as follows: there is a lot of murder and corruption in Russia, Putin is president, Putin is ex-KGB, therefore the ex-KGB are responsible for all the murder and corruption. This is not, incidentally, a fanciful notion. Russia is very corrupt and former Soviet security service officials are in places of high power in government and industry. But it does not necessarily follow that Putin ordered Litvinenko&apos;s murder, and this film fails to convince.\n\nIn fact, interesting theories arise when one poses the question: qui bono? Who stood to gain most by Litvinenko&apos;s murder? If Litvinenko fled Russia and continued his fierce accusations against Putin and the Russian regime, and then was assassinated, the finger would naturally point at the Kremlin. As it happened, condemnation was directed at the Russian government from around the world, which greatly benefited exiled Russian oligarch and fierce Kremlin opponent Boris Berezovsky, with whom Litvinenko had associated before he died. Could Berezovsky have killed Litvinenko? I was actually left with the impression that the director, Andrei Nekrasov, intended at least to hint at this possibility.\n\nThe film essentially points the finger at Putin and the FSB for the apartment bombings in Russia in 1999, which were blamed on the Chechens. These bombings served as the pretext for renewed war against Chechnya, and the blitz propelled Putin into the presidency. The theory¬ówhich is very believable¬óis that the apartment bombings were part of a Chekist plot to replace the ailing Boris Yeltsin with the authoritarian Vladimir Putin, thus securing the security services&apos; hold over the Russian political system. Berezovsky has made these very allegations from the safety of his estate in England, yet a closer look at the history of these incidents reveals that Berezovsky himself was part of the cabal that helped Putin to power. It was only after Putin became president that Berezovsky fled to Britain, having been betrayed by the new regime.\n\nIf the pro-Putin clique and Berezovsky were jointly culpable in the 1999 apartment bombings, it would perhaps be more difficult for the Putin regime to publicly accuse Berezovsky than vice-versa. It would automatically invite the question: how do you know? How would the Russian regime present evidence of Berezovsky&apos;s complicity in a terrorist acts without at the same time implicating itself?",

For those who love the adventures and action movies this one could be the prefect beginning for another one. Instead, the film moves into the philosophical reflection of meaning of life and death. The story is about love and struggling against fatality.\n\nDepp gives us a beautiful movie that shows an excellent director: the photography is wonderful, the first sequence is hallucinant; the only regret is that it remembers Jarmush&apos;s &quot;Dead Man&quot;.",

The fifth member of their group was killed during this event. Three of the men have spent the last 15 years of their lives trying to capture one of their captors. To their surprise, they manage to do so! However, capturing the alien is as far as their plans have ever gone. What to do with this being becomes the focus of the story, as well as revealing the back story of their past through heated dialogue. Their alien hostage proves to be far more dangerous and menacing than they ever expected. It seems that all horror films these days tend to inject ridiculous humor into their script. Altered stays on point, the serious tone remains throughout the entire film. This was a rare and welcome surprise. This film also manages to do something with its characters that I have rarely seen before. The characters that I really disliked in the first 20 minutes of the film I found myself having great sympathy for by the end. Such character development is very rare in low budget horror. The gore FX were excellent, and the makeup work was second to none. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that this film will become an instant cult classic, if not already."

      "reviewBody": "RELEASED IN 1983 and written &amp; directed by Mark Rosman Stoller, &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; chronicles events at a sorority house outside of Baltimore where seven girls responsible for an accidental death start dying one by one during their graduation party. \n\nThe film borrows elements from &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) and the French horror &quot;Diabolique&quot; (1955), like the unused swimming pool to conceal a body that later disappears. The first act is quite good, particularly the accidental death scene, which is well-acted for no-name actresses. Only two of the seven went on to a career in acting: The protagonist who plays Katie (Kate McNeil) and the slutty girl, Vicky (Eileen Davidson). Speaking of the girls, they present a realistic feminine smorgasbord with Morgan (Jodi Draigie) arguably being the most attractive. None of them, however, are anything to go gaga over (looks-wise, that is). \n\nWhat marred the film for me was the dubious writing. For instance, wouldn&apos;t the girls be perplexed at how a dead body mysteriously made it to the attic? What caused it to suddenly fall down the trap door? Why don&apos;t any of the girls look at the face of the corpse to verify its identity? Would a couple of girls who know very little about guns seriously enact a prank using a questionable mixture of bullets and blanks? If you can get past these issues, &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; is a decent early 80s&apos; slasher with a worthy plot and pretty good production values. \n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 31 minutes and was shot at Eltonhead Mansion in Pikesville, Maryland, with establishing shots done at University of Maryland, College Park. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Bobby Fine. \n\nGRADE: C",

      "reviewBody": "Attack the Block is one of those films that does exactly what it says on the tin - its a bunch of aliens attacking a bunch of roadmen in London. If this premise doesn&apos;t appeal to you, steer clear as the film isn&apos;t anymore complex or deep than that. I for one loved the premise. It was simple, effective, and entertaining!\n\nThe film has a great pace, with no messing about. Joe Cornish knew exactly what he wanted to do and got straight down to it. There was lots of good action, some great suspenseful scenes, and some neat chase scenes. At under an hour and a half long, Attack the Block never felt like it was dragging. It was zippy, fresh, and engaging.\n\nI wasn&apos;t massively in love with any of the characters. They were pretty cliched at times, and didn&apos;t really get much development. They just were who they were. I must say though Joe Cornish captured the generation perfectly. All the language and behaviour felt very real and authentic. The acting was decent as well, with Jodie Whittaker as the standout for me.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of the film though was the design of the aliens. They felt so fresh and unique, and just looked very cool whenever on screen. The effects haven&apos;t aged at all in 10 years.\n\nAttack the Block is a perfect film to sit back, switch off the brain, grab the popcorn and be thoroughly entertained.",

      "reviewBody": "Large swathes of China are falling under the despotic rule of Cao Shao-qin as he and his merciless Black Flag riders slaughter Government officials and anyone who threatens his rule.  When Cao captures the children of a murdered Lord, Zhou Huai-an mounts a rescue mission led by Qiu Moy-an.  With the children and her men, Qiu meets Zhou at the Dragon Inn, owed by the outlaw Jin Xiangyu ¬ñ who is only out for what she can make for herself.  With the pass shut, some of Cao&apos;s men arrive at the inn sparking a stand-off between the two groups with the money-grabbing Jin in the middle.  As the days pass, bad weather keep the groups in the inn while Cao and the Black Riders close in.\n\nI borrowed this film from a friend with no prior knowledge of it, so I checked out the reviews on imdb to get a taste for what it would be like.  I was immediately dubious when people, who had clearly only experienced this genre by seeing `Crouching Tiger&apos; in their multiplex, were calling it the greatest HK film ever made and other such absurd claims.  Also the way in which many users have compared this to `Crouching Tiger&apos; also suggests that that is the only benchmark they have.  However I settled to watch it.\n\nFor the most part I enjoyed it.  The plot worked quite well in miniature and only got weak in the final 10 minutes where it just seemed to collapse into an illogical confrontation.  The story is laced with humour which mostly works and has some nice touches (the teasing striptease-come-fight between Jin and Qiu was fun) but I did have a nasty taste due to some of the strong language and crudity which seemed out of place.\n\nWhat didn&apos;t work as well for me were the selfsame scenes that other reviewers have been raving about ¬ñ the fights.  In some of the scenes there are touches of clever choreography but often it is a swirling mix of arms and legs that is lost in editing that is far too quick at times to allow us to fully appreciate the moves.  The final fight (which again some users have called one of the greatest fights ever filmed!) is OK but not as acrobatic or inspiring as I&apos;d have liked ¬ñ also it&apos;s gore spoils the actual action to the point where it is laughable rather than exciting.  This is not to say that the fights are without merits (most of them are pretty good) but they are quite ordinary at times and lack a real imagination.  They are still exciting but don&apos;t be sucked in by the gushing praise from these pages.\n\nThe cast are all pretty good with some exceptions.  Leung is quite sturdy and delivers a character without too much flair but prevents him from being too wooden.  Donnie Yen was a disappointment for me.  His role consisted mostly of two cameos ¬ñ one at the start where he sit passively and the other at the end in an overly-gory fight scene which was so lost in a sand storm that his skills were not fully displayed.  The two women really made the film for me ¬ñthey both had different characters but also mixed it up and delivered the comedy.  Maggie Cheung probably shaded it as she had the most interesting character but Lin was also very good.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the film and am not suggesting that it is a bad film ¬ñ only a bit too gory for my tastes.  It is lightly funny and there is plenty of swordplay but it certainly never reaches the cinematic heights of ecstasy that are alluded to by some of the reviews here."

Jeanette and Ethel are the classiest folks in this and one wishes the vehicle were more worthy as they are a great team, both vocally and in easy going comedy.\n\nI won&apos;t go into the story line as it can be found elsewhere on this page. Robert Young tries valiantly, but is miscast. A light comedy actor with a penchant for bumbling or being a bit dumb, such as Ralph Bellamy or Fred MacMurray, may have been a better choice, although they were not under an MGM contract at the time.\n\nThe score, by Arlen and Harburg, is lackluster with the exception of the classic &quot;Buds Won&apos;t Bud,&quot; which Ethel Waters does full justice to in what is for me the high point of the film.\n\nJeannette takes part in 6 numbers: Les Filles de Cadiz, The Waltz is Over, No Place Like Love, Avalon, Cairo, and a bizarre patriotic medley, including Keep The Light Burning Bright, Waiting For The Robert. E. Lee, Sky Blue Waters, Home Sweet Home and The Beautiful Ohio.\n\nThis is the sort of film that needed an Ernst Lubitsch at the helm to make it a frothy and fun spoof on espionage and mistaken identity. W. S. Van Dyke takes the script a bit too seriously and loses most of the comedic opportunities.\n\nAll in all, harmless fun with a splendid Jeanette and Ethel duo.",

      "reviewBody": "In recent years it has become commonplace to site Frank Kapra&apos;s `It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&apos; as one of the greatest films ever. It has become a Christmas tradition. I feel that film is overrated. The problem I have with it is that it stacks the deck in trying to convince us of the value of human life. George Bailey is a successful banker- not exactly rich but successful enough that he contributed a lot of material things to people&apos;s lives, including a housing development named after him. He also saved his brother&apos;s life so his brother could save the men on that ship, etc. etc. The message is that you are of value if you have done the sort of things they build statues of people to honor.  On top of that, without George, everybody in this town is nothing. They are all drunks or crooks or prostitutes. They have no capabilities of their own. They are all dependent on George Bailey.\n\n I much prefer Carousel, whose hero is a bum. If you were to ask nearly everybody in town- a town that has done just fine without him, as a matter of fact, what Billy Bigelow contributed to their lives, they would say nothing- if they remembered him at all. The only people who would have anything good to say about him are those that he loved and who loved him. And that is the bottom line. If a person can be redeemed by his ability to love and to inspire love in others, we all have a chance. If you have to have a bank and town named after you, the bar is too high for most of us.\n\n As a musical, this is as good as it gets. `If I loved you&apos; is rivaled only by `Some Enchanted Evening&apos; as a love song and it means more as it&apos;s revealing of the character of this crude man who can&apos;t express what&apos;s in his soul and this shy girl who wants only to love and be loved. `Soliloquy&apos; is the dramatic highlight in the history of the musical as Billy works out all his hopes and dreams in his mind and vows to do anything he can to make his daughter&apos;s life special. By over reaching his bounds, he does the opposite. `What&apos;s the Use of Wondering&apos; expresses the doubts anyone entering a relationship has and is doubly moving as it&apos;s sung by Julie, for whom we know the song will have special relevance. `When You Walk Through a Storm&apos; offers hope to us all. Those old guys at graduations are really worth listening to."

I watched this film three or four times this week. It definitely brings up some very important, overlooked information. Both murders were very poorly investigated, if at all. There was obviously a lot of misinformation going on and internal corruption within certain police forces and government officials. What a surprise. It reminds me of the 9/11 investigation and how awful it was. Some people, even who have seen and reviewed this film on this site need to watch this film and recognize how well it was done.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh, my friend was just dying to see Nights in Rodanthe, I&apos;m convinced she is absolutely in love with Richard Gere, not to mention she just loves romantic movies, so Richard Gere and romance? It&apos;s a no brainer, she just had to see this movie, guess who she begged to go with her? Yeah, me, I didn&apos;t really want to see it though, it looked too sappy for my tastes, but we got to see it for free, so I figured to just go ahead and give it a fair chance. Well, we saw it today, it was a little better than I expected, which is saying plenty. After seeing the movie Unfaithful, I really wasn&apos;t into the whole Diane and Richard being back together on screen, but for some reason they made this story more enjoyable. Even though it was predictable, it was a sweet movie, I hate the sappy movies, despite it&apos;s sappiness that I normally resent, it&apos;s still a nice movie and was just a breath of fresh air due to the recent movies that we&apos;re getting that are either thrillers, comedies, or action.\n\nAdrienne Willis is a divorced mother of two who&apos;s ex-husband is begging to come back home after a nasty affair he had with one of her friends. She&apos;s debating on it since her children want them back together and she feels it should be that way. But when her friend leaves her to run her house on the beach that she rents out to people, Adrienne meets Paul Flanner, a doctor who has had a rough year after loosing a patient on a routine surgery, he&apos;s staying in the house with Adrienne. Loosing themselves has been so hard, but when they&apos;re together they find themselves once again and bring life back into their world realizing it&apos;s OK to be in love once more.\n\nNights in Rodanthe is a nice movie to watch... more so I&apos;d say for either a rental or a matin√©e, I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be, but it does get predictable, which I hate to say I&apos;ve just been seeing nothing but predictable films lately. Maybe I should start writing scripts if this is all it takes, I could write a number one movie maybe, wish me luck. But back onto the movie, it has decent acting and does give you watery eyes. It&apos;s a nice movie to watch, gives you a little smile and reminds you of the sweeter things in life. Richard and Diane made this movie enjoyable and were lovely on-screen together, it&apos;s worth the watch.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney&apos;s Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nCasey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics.\n\nTomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket.\n\nBrad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder.\n\nTomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson&apos;s look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair.\n\nAlthough Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof&apos;s fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it&apos;s revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand&apos;s Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it&apos;s the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World&apos;s Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful.\n\nTomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age.",

      "reviewBody": "There is very little to add to what has been said in the previous review, which sums up &apos;Dot and Santa Claus&apos; very well indeed. &apos;Dot and Santa Claus&apos; is the first sequel to &apos;Dot and the Kangaroo&apos; and is one of its better sequels and doesn&apos;t fare too badly in ranking of the series.\n\n&apos;Dot and Santa Claus&apos; is not perfect. It is agreed that some of the trippy sequences, such as the volcano monsters, add very little, next to nothing in fact, and feel very out of place within the rest of the film. The ending does feel abrupt, and again like &apos;Dot and the Kangaroo&apos;, while not as repetitive, the animation is not always great, being flat in colour and lacking finesse.\n\nHowever, the backgrounds are meticulously detailed and the live action works very well and doesn&apos;t jar at all.\n\nMeanwhile, the music fares much better than in &apos;Dot and the Kangaroo&apos;. &quot;Are You Going to the Circus&quot; fares best, while the touching &quot;It&apos;s So Easy to be Lost in a Crowd&quot; and uplifting &quot;Ingenuity&quot; are not too far behind.\n\nThe script is funny, poignant and heart-warming, while the characters are engaging and well voiced by the likes of Barbara Frawley, Ron Haddrick and Drew Forsythe.\n\nLike with &apos;Dot and the Kangaroo&apos;, it&apos;s the story where &apos;Dot and Santa Claus&apos; shines brightest. Parts are fun and uplifting, but it&apos;s the charm and emotional heart that&apos;s particularly note-worthy, really warming the heart and moving even the most cynical of adults to at least a tear or two. The messaging is sincere and never preachy or tacked-on.\n\nIn summary, good first follow-up. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t believe this Japanese thriller has anything to do with the new Brad Pitt movie (besides the two having almost identical titles). I still don&apos;t know whether I&apos;ll see 2022&apos;s Bullet Train, but its release reminded me to watch 1975&apos;s The Bullet Train, and it ended up being a pretty good watch.\n\nI always thought Speed had an original plot, but it takes the basic premise of this movie and puts the action on a bus, rather than a train. Because in The Bullet Train, there&apos;s a bomb on a train, and the train will explode if it drops below a certain speed, with the bombers wanting ransom money before they&apos;ll agree to disarm the bomb.\n\nIt does play out more like a large scale Hollywood disaster movie than a small-scale action-thriller. The scope is actually pretty wide, and I felt like most of the scenes didn&apos;t actually take place on the train - a big part of the movie is about finding the masterminds behind the bombing. The train scenes themselves are great, though. All really exciting, and I think it used real trains for the most part (or if there were miniatures used, I couldn&apos;t tell).\n\nThere are plenty of recognisable Japanese actors all doing solid work, and the film is mostly entertaining throughout, even if I didn&apos;t love it. I will say: I was a goose and didn&apos;t research properly before watching, so I watched an inferior version that was dubbed and about half an hour shorter than what I realise now is the original version. So for the stuff I didn&apos;t like, it might (well, probably would) be better in the original cut, so that&apos;s on me for jumping the gun and watching a re-edit like a doofus.",

      "reviewBody": "Jimmy Morgan lives in a self-contained world: a serious agoraphobic, he never leaves his apartment and his main connection with the world is the telephone. After all, everything he needs is right there or it can be sent for, like his regular call girl. He doesn&apos;t have to work because his father left him a large bank account and a half interest in the family business. Jimmy thinks he&apos;s well off in his self-imposed version of solitary confinement, but a swift fate hangs over him, for he is a gambling addict and he&apos;s been emptying his bank account to pay off his mob-owned bookie. Worse yet, he signs documents he hasn&apos;t read and the last one he signed turned control of his share of the business over to his unscrupulous partner Leo, who has siphoned all the money away. Jimmy&apos;s only close connection to his family is his adoring 11-year-old daughter, who seems blissfully unaware of her father&apos;s deteriorating mental health and looming financial crisis.\n\nAll the bad news comes at once, as Jimmy finds he&apos;s lost his half of the business and the fact that he owes his bookie $52,000. He knows the mob will do him serious bodily harm if he doesn&apos;t come up with the money fast and he&apos;s forced to liquidate the entire contents of his apartment, leaving him sitting on the hard floor of a totally empty living room, looking like he&apos;s ready to be taken away like the furniture and other valuables he&apos;s just lost. In the span of a very short time careless Jimmy, who was too absorbed in his gambling and other pleasures to mind his financial and business affairs, has gone from seemingly prosperous to virtually homeless. The screen fades to black as an unshaven Jimmy, looking like the homeless bum he likely very soon will be, sits on a bench talking to his young daughter, who will soon become another lost item in his life when she moves away with her mother.\n\nNearly all the characters in Jimmy&apos;s orbit are worth mentioning, even though some are heard (over the telephone) but never seen: the ex-wife, who must have been through hell with her lazy, neurotic husband, the male friends who want to help but can&apos;t, the hooker who cares for him because of his kindness and crooked partner Leo, who gives a memorable, lashing speech, reminding the irate Jimmy that one who pays no attention to his own business affairs, spends like a drunken sailor and signs contracts he hasn&apos;t even read deserves just what he gets.\n\nA tiny but interesting facet of the movie is the homeless man who inhabits the tiny foyer of Jimmy&apos;s building. Jimmy even talks to this man via the closed-circuit TV and the intercom and tells the man he can stay where he is overnight to keep out of the cold. The homeless man seems to be symbolic of Jimmy&apos;s impending plight and when he disappears you get the feeling that Jimmy won&apos;t be long in following him out the door and into the street.\n\nThis remarkable movie features a fine cast and an unforgettable performance by Elliott Gould, who deserved an award for this little-known film. I was lucky enough to tape it and wish it would be aired again for the benefit of all who&apos;ve never seen what Elliott Gould is capable of with material like this.",

Is he a fraud or not?  Jeff Goldblum is also excellent as &quot;Robert Ricky&quot; the cynical shopping channel executive. Watching how &quot;conformists&quot; react to an alternative lifestyle provides many laughs - watch out for the urineade scene. Every time this film is on, I find myself settling down to watch just a few minutes, then of course I end up watching it all.  I have a feeling it has already joined Wayne&apos;s World as one of of those films where you lie in wait for your favourite scenes, then recite them!  Definitely well worth watching especially if you have a quirky sense of humour. Fab."

Although the kid is cute, some of the humour is strained here, with some gags lasting too long, and things feel a little flat after the breakneck pace of the film&apos;s first half. At 40 minutes, this film was longer than Lloyd&apos;s usual two-reelers and it&apos;s likely that he deliberately made the film this way so that it could be split into two short films if the longer running time failed to please his fans.\n\nThis isn&apos;t one of Lloyd&apos;s best film but it probably has just about enough highlights to keep most fans happy.",

It&apos;s Not exactly a pure sci-fi film so it&apos;s not going to go too much into detail regarding technology but more thought provoking than anything.\n\nI would say this is worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Moli√®re is one of the greatest French writers of all time, so it was almost inevitable that the cinema takes an interest in the man by devoting him a movie. It&apos;s Ariane Mouchkine who made this biography, she&apos;s a woman of the theatre and the manager of the theatre company: &quot;the Theatre of the Sun&quot;. However, her movie isn&apos;t a filmed stage production because she introduces a lot of life and movements in her making. Moreover, there isn&apos;t one sole scenerie but a thousand various sceneries! In another hand, the performance of the actors isn&apos;t theatrical, except, of course, when they&apos;re on stage. The movie, you can guess it, was expensive but it was worthwhile! An important budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the seventeenth century: the costumes and sceneries are magnificient and the muddy streets of the towns are very realistic. The movie mainly focuses on the most important events of Moli√®re&apos;s life: his childhood, his student years, his beginnings in the theatre and his success in the court of Louis XIV in spite of &quot;Tartuffe&quot;&apos;s scandal . Some of these events will later inspire him for his plays. For example, at the beginning of the movie, Moli√®re&apos;s mother dies of a fatal disease and the doctors are powerless to heal her. More serious: they don&apos;t hesitate in feasting and eating in Moli√®re&apos;s house. This last one understood that doctors are only profiteer charlatans and that medicine is far from being efficient. He&apos;ll ridiculise them later in some of his plays. Besides, it&apos;s not only Moli√®re&apos;s character who interests Mouchkine but  all an era: the seventeenth century with all its miseries, its grandeurs and its contradictions. Nevertheless, the end of the movie is a bit disappointing. Moli√®re&apos;s life after 1666 and until 1673, date of his death, isn&apos;t clearly made. It&apos;s during this era that he knew his hour of glory by writing unforgettable plays despite his disease ( he suffered from tuberculosis) . It would have been interesting to see him writing and performing these plays on stage. At last, Philippe Caub√®re is an excellent Moli√®re and in the end, in spite of its length, &quot;Moli√®re&quot; is simply a beautiful movie."

In this black and white non-classic, Kenneth More plays the semi-moronic William Blood who makes his living volunteering for medical trials. Until now, no one seems to have realised that Blood is a medical marvel himself, he doesn&apos;t get ill however they try to infect him, something that may be due to his laid back attitude.\n\nThis prompts the British space research team (seriously) to recruit him for a trip to the Moon. The only problem is that this is purely a one-way trip, which of course Blood doesn&apos;t realise. Needless to say, things don&apos;t go quite according to plan. There is a minor sub- plot featuring a very blonde ing√©nue, who deserves that appellation in spite of her being a stripper by profession. \n\n&quot;Man In The Moon&quot; is all very tame but it does give a couple of good lines to one of its minor characters that will deserve to be remembered by Libertarians and philosophers long after the film itself is forgotten.",

      "reviewBody": "Hugo Haase (Georg Thomalla) is quite happy working as a baker, but has to do all the early work in total silence so as not to wake up his rather dominant wife. Two sub plots are established at the beginning, one for each of the Haase family children. The younger boy gets his friends to sabotage the new supermarket from the first day it opens, while the older daughter is trying to keep her pilot boyfriend a secret even though he followed her home and soon starts helping in the bakery.\n\nNeither of these stories are allowed to develop much further when Hugo inherits zwei Millionen Mark and decides to leave his family and start anew in Venice. But the silly baker is almost immediately fooled out of the entire fortune by Clarissa the red haired trickster. The audience can see this coming a mile off, but has to endure a lengthy montage of Hugo wining and dining Clarissa and enjoying a tedious ice skating show all the same. After this it gets more and more absurd. Herr Haase commits himself to a loony bin, but is released when two wealthy eccentrics mistake him for someone called August. O brother. The female of this couple even practices Kung Fu on bricks. You might wonder if this was Willy Pribil first attempt at a screenplay, as he obviously tries to include every single comedic scenario he could come up with (according to IMDB it was his second).\n\nWhen &apos;August&apos; escapes from this latest predicament, he literally drops in on a couple of crooks, who decide they can use him as a scape goat and so our hero Hugo becomes a fugitive. Back at the bakery his wife does not seem to be missing him at all while their children are too wrapped up in their own little movies to notice daddy plastered all over the newspapers (ever notice that comedy characters never buy their own newspapers but always notice the right headlines when some stranger on the street is reading one?). It all culminates in a clothes store where all the various characters meet up by pure coincidence. But by this point in the story nobody will be surprised by yet another unexpected plot twist. And in the middle of this Willy the writer finally pulls out his best gag, the one everything has all been leading up to. I won&apos;t spoil it here, but it has something to do with Hugo&apos;s last name.\n\n4 out of 10"

Not your average pre-holocaust story, but a rewarding exploration of a lesser-known case.\n\nSome of the performances were rather wooden, and the direction felt a bit awkward and TV-ish at times, but the story was gripping. A much different role for Mr. Swayze, as well. I didn&apos;t expect him capable of such a sobering dramatic performance.\n\nI hadn&apos;t heard of Halsman before, but am curious to learn more about him.\n\nI will definitely watch this again, though I can&apos;t wait for it to hit the big screen.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in the shadow of the higher budget and more audacious comic fantasy masterpiece &apos;The Lost Boys&apos;, Near Dark doesn&apos;t quite get the recognition it deserves within the horror genre. Although it&apos;s not as great as the aforementioned cult classic, Near Dark has it&apos;s own niche within the vampire sub-genre for being such an original take on it. The rules of vampire horror have been reinvented, changed or discarded completely and the result is something to behold. This allows Katherine Bigelow to do whatever she wants with the premise, and this makes for a very thrilling movie as we&apos;re lead to believe that absolutely anything can happen, which continually keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The story, which takes in various elements of common vampire folklore such as the transition from human to inhuman, follows Caleb Colton; a young farm boy that is taken in by a beautiful young woman (and you wouldn&apos;t blame him when you see her¬Ö), and soon finds himself battling with some strange ailment that makes him allergic to sunlight, shortly before being picked up by a rag-tag band of vampires that inhabit an old pick up truck. We then follow Caleb as he comes to terms with his situation and attempts to fit in with the pack...\n\nFor this movie, Katherine Bigelow recruited three of the support players from her then husband&apos;s fabulous &apos;Aliens&apos;. Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Janette Goldstein bring life to the movie&apos;s core as the three major players of the vampire nomads. Bill Paxton in particular is fantastic as usual as Severen; the most pronounced member of the group. Bill is an actor that tends to get support roles that almost carry the film, and that&apos;s exactly the case here. That&apos;s not to say that Near Dark is only Paxton&apos;s movie, as Adrian Pasdar and the incredible Jenny Wright do well in the lead roles, as do the rest of the support players. But when the movie is over, it&apos;s Bill Paxton that sticks in your mind the most. The cinematography on show in Near Dark is superb and a delight for the eyes ¬ñ as well as the brain, because Near Dark breathes a continual atmosphere of intrigue from the way it&apos;s beautifully shot. The music by Tangerine Dream is right on cue as well, and it brings a surreal, trippy sensation to the proceedings, which emphasises the dream-like state that our hero has been put into.\n\nNear Dark is a vampire movie free of the usual clich√©s and one that makes it&apos;s own rules, which makes it must see for the vampire fan. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this movie to people who are new to the vampire movie from the off, however, as it&apos;s one that needs to be viewed after you&apos;ve got used to the genre staples in order to fully appreciate it, but once you have got used to it; this isn&apos;t a movie you&apos;ll want to miss.",

      "reviewBody": "He did it in 1961, in 1962, in 1963, and in 1964 Godard made another movie about a woman questioning the meaning of love, life, and acting. This movie, like the others, is a fun treat for Godard fans and fans of inventive camera and editing techniques, though it doesn&apos;t have as much heart as &quot;Contempt&quot;, &quot;Une femme est une femme&quot;, or even &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot;.\n\n&quot;Une femme mariee&quot; depicts the affair of a bored housewife, but director Godard strives to convey the feeling that we are reading about her in a women&apos;s magazine. To achieve this the scenes with the actors abruptly cuts to fashion photos, make- up ads, and text. It&apos;s a stylish movie with a brisk pace, but, just like a magazine story, it doesn&apos;t take long for it to leave the mind or heart either. Yes, Godard&apos;s creativity may soar higher here than ever before. His playfulness leaps through the surprising angles and reveals, his panning of words in magazines, x-ray photography, and whispered narration, etc, yet the story seems tacked on. We float from idea to idea as they enter and leave the director&apos;s head, which is fun for a one-time viewing, probably the way that glancing at his sketchbook may feel, but the lack of motivation, of purpose, inevitably keeps this effort from standing in the same grouping as the previously mentioned works, the ones that we watch more frequently, the ones that give us cinematic nourishment, the more organic, more well-rounded, fully realized pieces.",

      "name": "Gorgeous and attractive film about the epic feat of the British explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his long-suffering expedition",
      "reviewBody": "The story of British explorer Robert Falcon Scott&apos;CVO (6 June 1868 - c. 29 March 1912) , masterfully played by John Mills , and his 1912 expedition and his quest to be the first to reach the South Pole . It is magnificently adapted by means of a splendid cinematography, adequate make up , impressive exteriors and formidable effects . Dealing with his worried wife (Diana Churchil) and how Robert Scott enlists a motley and highy-prepared group (James Robertson Justice , Christopher Lee ,Kenneth More , John Gregson , Derek Bond , Clive Morton ,among others) to carry out the risked travel . But a rival team of Norwegian explorers led by Amundsen conspire against him.\n\n The true story of how a hero attempts to be the first man to discover the South Pole, only to find that the murderously cold weather and far North Pole spoil their ill-fated expedition . To add to the authenticity of this near-documentary/drama movie , it had a lot of the Antarctic scenes that were filmed in Graham Land, Antarctica, , furthermore : Norway, Jungfrau, Kanton Bern, Switzerland , Falmouth Docks, Falmouth, Cornwall, England. Although there was about various weeks to get worthwhile filming locations , the vast majority of this picture was actually shot on studio , in Ealing Studios, Ealing, London. Breathtaking and overwhelming cinematography by three best cameramen of the British cinema : Osmond Borradaile , Jack Cardiff and Geoffrey Unsworth . Adding an impressive and rousing musical score by Vaughan Williams . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Charles Frend . Charles made his directorial debut in 1942 and turned out several low-budget dramas and documentaries. After the war he directed several critically acclaimed dramas, including Cruel Sea (1953) and Scott of the Antarctic (1948) at his best . His final film as director was The Sky-Bike (1967) and the film on which he ended his career was Ryan&apos;s daughter (1970), on which he worked as a second-unit .\n\n Adding more biographic remarks , the deeds happened in the following way : Robert Falcon Scott was a Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery expedition of 1901-1904 and the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition of 1910-1913. On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82¬∞S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after Amundsen&apos;s South Pole expedition. The temperatures recorded by Scott and his team on remain to this day some of the lowest ever recorded. A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott&apos;s written instructions, and at a distance of 162 miles (261 km) from their base camp at Hut Point and approximately 20 km from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his party&apos;s bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic fossils ever discovered. The fossils were determined to be from the Glossopteris tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents. Before his appointment to lead the Discovery expedition, Scott had followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead . Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life. Following the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below , 40 ¬∞C in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scott&apos;s written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip that was flop . Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912, or possibly one day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die. The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved. Tryggve Gran, who was part of the search party, described the scene as, &quot;snowcovered til up above the door, with Scott in the middle, half out of his bagg ... the frost had made the skin yellow &amp; transparent &amp; I&apos;ve never seen anything worse in my life&quot;. Their final camp became their tomb; the tent roof was lowered over the bodies and a high cairn of snow was erected over it, topped by a roughly fashioned cross, erected using Gran&apos;s skis . As an Observation Hill memorial cross, was erected in 1913 and Captain Scott&apos;s log and many of the personal effects of the explorers were loaned by The British Museum . Rating 7.5/10 . Better than average .",

The man by the name of Jim Winorski, created this masterpiece that deserves a place alongside the great films of our time. And I thought no movie could be worse than Troll 2. Well let me tell you, Troll 2 is to Ghooulies IV what Gone with the Wind is to Heaven&apos;s Gate. There are no actors, only people trying to act. And their attempts are beyond the pathetic. The creature on the box isn&apos;t even the same as in the movie!! Absolutely the most amateurish film I&apos;ve ever seen - I could do better with a videocamera and no script. Ugh. I didn&apos;t even find it bad enough to be able to enjoy it for camp (like Ed Wood) - it&apos;s JUST BAD. The worst film I&apos;ve ever seen."

The first 10 minutes are kind of creepy, then the movie gets boring until the expected end.

      "reviewBody": "Some people take this movie dull and slow-paced. The truth is that on the contrary it goes very fast, blitz. \n\nMaestro Wu leads a legendary life and dominated the Go world for at least twenty years. He beat every single possible Go player and finished the famous Jubango, in total twelve tournaments, ten games per tournament. All these were condensed to one scene, one passage, one sentence in the movie. The last battle scene against the Honinbo Takagawa. It shows how the director arranged the movie and what he targeted on. Not win or lose, but belief (faith) and Go which supported Wu along the life path and armed him for the inevitable turmoil.\n\nYou will find the same set-up again and again, a shabby house. Yet watch closely that the tone color changes and becomes bright when Wu was mentally reborn. And then the beautiful Japan seashore as in the painting.\n\nWu&apos;s mentor said, as a Go player, you should die on the board. It is him who insisted the Honinbo tournament should be held during the war time.You will find the game in Hiroshima went on right after the bombing. In a sense a Go player is a samurai fighting on the board. He must obey the honor code.\n\nYet a Go player has to retire or retreat once he is not able to win. A very cruel fact Wu had to accept. Then he became a mentor and eventually an ordinary man, who lives peacefully. No more wars, Wu reconciled with himself and the movie leads us back to the first scene philosophically.\n\nThe drawback of the movie is that it IS fragmented. It introduces a lot of people without even telling you their names. I highly doubt that if you are not familiar with Wu, you can recognize who is who, for example, Kita Fumiko in the beginning of the movie. Though it is not the main point at all, since the director cut all the dramatic parts of Wu&apos;s achievements. \n\nThe movie is centered around how to be stern and humble. It is universal; the director used Go as an interface and Wu as an example.\n\nI as a mathematician want to remind you that the Go rules are simple yet there are no matching models. It is much harder a problem than Chess. Currently we only know the ending part.

The special effects are generally cheesy, but fun. I doubt this is going to scare anybody, but although predictable it&apos;s a fun film to watch.\n\nIf you love the monster/horror/thriller genres you&apos;ll enjoy this one."

      "reviewBody": "What makes Grand Illusion a great movie, and the reason that some of us keep returning to it, is that it can&apos;t be reduced to a single simple proposition, the way that recent war movies like Platoon (&quot;war bad,&quot; to quote Tarantino&apos;s synopsis) or Saving Private Ryan (&quot;war senseless&quot;) can. It&apos;s easy to be sentimental about war, even while deploring it, by focusing on the horror of it or by making heroes out of those who are forced to fight. Renoir deals instead with the far more complex mesh of differences and alliances that separate and divide our characters. And while his main characters all have a clear class/national/religious identity, he makes much more out of them than just sociological categories.\n\nBut trying to explain why Grand Illusion is such a great movie by charting all the conflicting bonds of nationality, class, religion, etc. doesn&apos;t explain why the movie is so powerful. To me it is in those scenes in which language either separates our characters (as when Marechal tries and fails to tell the British prisoners about the tunnel or asks why de Boeldieu uses &quot;vous&quot;) or unites them (as when von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu speak in English or the English officer (in drag) sings the Marseillaise or when Marechal finally learns a little German). In these cases, Renoir uses language-without hitting us over the head to make the point-to illustrate the conflict between his ideal of sympathy between humans and the differences of class, nationality and religion.\n\nNow I know that this sounds just as dry and academic as other attempts to explain Grand Illusion. Maybe it is; the movie really does not need to be explained to be enjoyed. But these are the scenes that, for whatever reason, have always made the greatest impression on me.",

      "reviewBody": "With house architecture, gingerbread is the decorative, fluffy lace that is put on a Victorian house. Most Victorian masses are really ugly, clumsy, incompetent -- and that&apos;s why gingerbread was developed. The reason behind all this was the rise of the carpenter-designer. Victorian architecture is a product of the industrial age. Everyone wanted such a house, and with few skilled architects around, some blunt conventions were developed that any craftsman could use. And then dress up the horrendous result with gingerbread.\n\nSo it is with this film. The key problem here is that it has no master designer. The script was rather developed on the spot in Altman&apos;s famous `let&apos;s improvise&apos; method by the rude mechanicals involved.\n\n This film was made for one reason: Branagh had a Clinton impression he didn&apos;t want to waste. And at least his contribution is all built around his singular idea of the man, using the blunt conventions of the `thriller.&apos; Altman is just along for the ride.\n\nIn comments on Branagh&apos;s Shakespeare (and the Shakespeare of others), I&apos;ve noted the pitfalls of putting an actor in charge. Actors are very late in the dramatic food chain, and just cannot understand bigger picture dynamics. Branagh himself has escaped these limitations (when he has) only because he is adept with Shakespearian conventions. (His acting always is remarkable, but that&apos;s another issue.)\n\nSee this film. It really helps to put perspective on the very interesting adventure of Branagh&apos;s trying to grow Shakespeare from the actor&apos;s eye. And it helps one understand why his `Love&apos;s Labor&apos;s Lost&apos; is as it is."

Though that was no easy task, since the movie has never been released on DVD and has never popped up on any of the TV channels in my area (the last one probably because of the nudity in the movie.) I finally found it in a video store that still rents out VHS tapes. Well, is it as bad as you&apos;ve heard? Yeah, it&apos;s pretty bad. The acting is pretty awful and the big names in the cast seem ill at ease throughout. The movie also has a poor sense of time, with periods that took a long time in real life condensed in what seems like a couple of weeks. And despite the fairly lavish budget, a lot of the movie looks surprisingly cheap and slapdash. (For example, a lot of the time when the ships are at sea, it&apos;s clear the boats are floating just a few feet from land.) As for the character of Christopher Columbus, you never get a feel of a real character, or feel what drives him or what he really feels. If you want to find out more about Columbus, I strongly suggest you go to your local library instead of sitting through this phoniness.\n\nNow, to find a copy of 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE..."

      "reviewBody": "A must-see film for any Gary Cooper or Ingrid Bergman fan, Saratoga Trunk shows them both off to great effect. Cooper is especially good in a serio-comic role as a no-nonsense Texan playing off of Bergman&apos;s frivolous, free-spirited social climber. She has a penchant for stirring up mischief as she wields her feminine charms amongst the dueling rail-baron wannabee&apos;s at an elegant Saratoga Springs resort.\n\nA terrific supporting cast adds lots of flavor, and Florence Bates almost walks off with the film as a street-wise society matron who helps Bergman navigate through the seas of snobbery and aristocratic treachery.\n\nIt has been said by some that both Cooper and Bergman are miscast in their roles, a matter of opinion, ultimately. They both make their respective roles their own, and it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;s difficult to imagine anyone else playing them, especially with their level of chemistry. Every film has flaws; the good acting here more than makes up for this film&apos;s few shortcomings. Well worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "To me, this is one of the greatest tragedies of 1999.  A nice cast and intriguing story have the potential to elevate this to a great piece of work, yet it fails on a couple of fundamental levels.  First, _Beautiful People_ is overburdened with cliches: the immigrant who wants to know &quot;the meaning of life,&quot; the mortal enemies who have the same shoe size, etc.  I found these excessive to the point that they triggered my gag reflex. Second, and more damaging to the film, it is edited extremely poorly.  There are simply too many characters and storylines for this director to handle well.  By the time a particular storyline comes around again, the audience has completely forgotten it.  (Incidentally, this multiple character and storyline trick can be pulled off with great success- Paul Thomas Anderson did a superb job in _Magnolia_).  The film does have its high points, in particular the spectacular performance by Charlotte Coleman.  Not bad, but that&apos;s about all one can say.",

Not just in the United States, but everywhere in the world.\n\nUnfortunately it cannot be fully called a historical drama yet. But hopefully, some day in the future we can watch this, have a chuckle and weep tears of sadness for the past in which racism, prejudice, bigotry and police brutality was commonplace. Until then: let&apos;s spread this movie out like a virus. It&apos;s been 30 years with hardly any change, the previous generations haven&apos;t been able to eradicate the evil that is racism.

They are both in this well executed movie, Kjer in front of the camera and Ipsen as a director behind it together with talented photographer Valdemar Christiansen. Adding Mogens Wieth as an insecure pianist seeking psychoanalyst help from Gull-may Norin things cannot go wrong, and you only wish Bodil Ipsen had used her obvious directing talent more often. Mogens Wieth was regarded as an actor having international potential, and he actually made it to the Old Vic in London, but unfortunately he died during rehearsals. Bodil Kjer was trusted to be able to perform a similar international career, but she chose to stay in Denmark, where he had an even more successful career within the theater. A character putting things in place in this film is Petrine Sonne. She was a very fine somewhat overlooked supporting actor, but somehow she always steal the scene the times she appear on the screen.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though only around a third of John Ford&apos;s pictures are westerns, it&apos;s still undeniable that his forte or, if you prefer, his comfort zone was in historical pictures of some sort. Arrowsmith is unusual in that it is a contemporary drama that Ford both directed and co-produced.\n\nIn spite of the above, you might think this was indeed a western from the opening scene, in which we see an ancestor of the protagonist as a good ol&apos; covered wagon pioneer. This bit of family history is not brought up again, but it was obviously judged by Ford and Sam Goldwyn to be significant enough to open the film with, even though it would have been one of the most expensive scenes of the shoot (unless that opening shot is lifted from somewhere else, which it may well be). The point seems to be to draw a line between the struggles of the pioneers and the main story of a medical scientist torn between his home life and his career. It seems a rather tenuous comparison.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be parallels between Dr Arrowsmith and a typical Fordian westerner. Not in the character as written ‚Äì I&apos;m no auteur theorist ‚Äì but in the way Ford shoots their environments. In the majority of Ford films he exaggerates the smallness of interiors and the vastness of exteriors. The homestead is safe, yet dull, and the great outdoors is exciting yet dangerous. The village where Arrowsmith practices as a country doctor is shot in much the same way as Ford would a western settlement ‚Äì cramped interiors, foreground clutter and heavy use of framing. However the medical research centre, while it may be another interior, is shot so as to show off its openness and stark cleanliness, with corridors and waiting rooms so vast they look almost surreal. This is Arrowsmith&apos;s &quot;wild west&quot;, where he is free to be a pioneer of another sort. Another tenuous comparison? Maybe, but remember directors have many choices of how to shoot a place, regardless of the script or the set design, and these choices will reflect how they view that space and what they feel it means to the story.\n\nWhile Ford&apos;s use of space developed incredibly early on, the camera movement at this stage is not yet of the &quot;invisible camera&quot; technique that later became his standard. For those that don&apos;t know, invisible camera means you only move the camera when it&apos;s following an action, say for example a character walking to the other end of the room. If everyone in the scene is sitting still, the camera sits still. If it&apos;s done properly the audience doesn&apos;t notice the camera movement, hence &quot;invisible camera&quot;. And yet here there is rather a lot of obtrusive camera movement. This is pretty much in line with the general style of the time, in spite of the myth that cameras were immobilised in the early sound era. Despite a few teething problems that were mostly solved by the end of 1929, cameras of the early talkies zipped around just as giddily of those of the late silents.\n\nFord is not known to have given his actors much coaching, nor allow them rehearsals or repeated takes to hone their performance. For this reason the acting in his pictures tends to be only as good as the raw talent of the performers. Ronald Coleman and Helen Hayes were both good dramatic actors, and here they give good ‚Äì but not outstanding ‚Äì dramatic performances. Richard Bennett however just gives a fairly standard, slightly comical supporting-player performance as Sondelius, and the part should either have been cast differently or he should have been prompted to play it with more conviction.\n\nThe story goes that the hard-drinking Ford was contracted by Goldwyn to remain teetotal until the production wrapped. Apparently Ford, eager to get back to the bottle, rushed the shooting even more than usual, tearing pages out of the script wherever he could get away with it. Whether this is true or just another bit of Ford mythology, it certainly makes sense. In particular the love story, crucial to the picture&apos;s impact, is massively underdeveloped. Downplaying the romantic angle is actually very typical of Ford, but even the usual Fordian semi-improvised comedy diversions are absent ‚Äì with the exception of a couple of nice gags in a scene where a boy has his tooth pulled, and an almost surreal moment where a comedy drunk inexplicably wanders on and off the set. The resultant picture is full of great moments, but overall seems a little undernourished. Arrowsmith could have been an intense and poignant drama, but Ford was the wrong man for the job.",

Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro.\n\nBut is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual, and sexual ?\n\nI find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people enjoying doing what they like best.   The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery&apos;s less evident, more inward quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime experience.   As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman&apos;s worth.   Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.   While, at the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually liking him on her side.\n\nAdmittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.\n\nWatch &quot;Entrapment&quot; !   Enjoy it as I did for what it is, not for what it is not!- (rating 7.5/10)"

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t really know much CARNIVAL OF SOULS, other than that it was a low-budget horror movie with a cult fan-base. What I got was certainly interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. The story is probably the weakest element, as the characters don&apos;t really have any depth or personality, and the plot is paper-thin. It&apos;s still a compelling watch, though, due to the atmosphere created by a creepy organ score and some excellent cinematography. So, it succeeds as a mood-piece even while failing at the narrative level. The story is about a woman who survives a car wreck and then takes a job as a church organist in Utah. When she moves into town, she starts seeing a ghostly figure and is strangely drawn to an abandoned carnival. This basically sets the stage for a series of sequences where she hallucinates a lot and starts questioning her sanity, as do the people she encounters. There were also a few scenes which kind of tap into human fascination with religion and the supernatural. She sees herself as a rational person, only taking the organist position for the money, but the things she sees bring her into conflict with herself and others. Ultimately, though, the film is mostly about the creepy atmosphere and imagery, which are quite good. One scene I liked in particular took place in the church. She starts off playing out of her organ music book, but then transitions into carnival-esque music, almost as if in a trance. There was also a lot of good on-location shooting. For a film with such a low budget, it looked fairly decent. The only real complaint I have outside of the thin story was that the sound mix was muddled in places, making dialogue hard to hear. Ultimately, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, is an intriguing curiosity which, despite lacking in terms of story, has some cool visuals and a suitably unnerving score.",

      "reviewBody": "Ploughing the same furrow as conspiracy-style futuristic sci-fi thrillers as Spielberg&apos;s MINORITY REPORT, HARDWIRED is a science fiction film on a budget. Starring the less-than-stellar Cuba Gooding Jr. as an ordinary guy who almost dies in a car accident and is brought back to life thanks to the intervention of a sinister commercial organisation, this is slightly disappointing and intriguing in equal measure.\n\nThe most interesting part of the production are the sly digs at numerous subject matters, including the failings of the American healthcare system and the increasingly desperate efforts of modern-day advertisers. The sci-fi and action tropes are less successful, with a few cheesy CGI effects thrown into the mix, but the script is a little more intelligent than is the usual for the B-movie genre.\n\nHARDWIRED also boasts a fine supporting role for the criminally underrated Michael Ironside, who gets the opportunity to sink his teeth into a decent character part for a change after years spent whiling away his time in Z-grade disaster flicks. There&apos;s also a good performance from the up-and-coming Tatiana Maslany, although the less said about Val Kilmer&apos;s bad guy the better; Kilmer is stiffer than a board here and his acting often painful.\n\nStill, this is a film which turns out slightly better than I had expected, and the various mind-melding mind-control stuff is handled in such a way that&apos;s not original, but nevertheless entertaining. HARDWIRED is certainly no classic, but an efficient enough timewaster.",

      "name": "Decent plot, marred by awful acting",
      "reviewBody": "For this type of thriller, this movie is entirely average. The plot and overall theme is decent enough, but the film loses any potential it might have by featuring such lousy acting. Even Max von Sydow, who is a veteran and is normally an excellent actor was disappointing in this. The only actor who did even a decent job was Matt Dillon. The film also has a bad pace, it&apos;s far too slow; in fact, it&apos;s incredibly slow and boring, for such a short film; it&apos;s just over 90 minutes, yet I can&apos;t bring myself to sit through the entire thing again(I did once, but ever since then I haven&apos;t been able to do so). The climax in the film is also below average, and flat-out boring. The supposed twist-in-the-end was lame, and not to mention far too easy to figure out. Also, the film introduces the villain far too early, in my opinion. Five minutes into the film, you knew who you were gonna root against. That&apos;s just too early. The film lacks any real surprises, as well as any great qualities. The few scenes detailing the psychopath&apos;s gruesome murders are decent, but lacks any real intensity or excitement, simply because you know exactly what will happen. As far as thrillers go, this is average and entirely forgettable. I recommend it only to the biggest of thriller fans. 5/10",

It feels in many ways like any other FBI/CIA international mystery thriller involving lots of brutally murdered people, with the exception of the setting.\n\nNice FX and a sort of gore horror film element (that axe murderer story lovers will greatly appreciate) add something beyond the FBI melodrama to create some excitement, thrills, and disturbing moments.",

Paul Henreid is in support, but Arthur Kennedy as Branwell is the standout. The mood of the time and place is very well captured and the photography and background music are superb. Not a lot of emphasis is given to the wonderful books, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily &amp; Charlotte, but rather the main story revolves around the girls&apos; love lives. This film has been panned by many critics, but I feel it deserves a far better reception than it has received - Warners had themselves to blame as they delayed its release for a couple of years simply because of the fight with Miss de Havilland - incidentally she won it!",

      "reviewBody": "The recent Ron Howard documentary, &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days a Week&quot; contained about ninety percent of material I had never seen before. This film, which I saw under the title &quot;The Unseen Beatles&quot;, was closer to a hundred percent and offered a myriad of stills and home movie clips that weren&apos;t a part of the Howard treatment. By virtue of it&apos;s source material and the era from which it came, a lot of the picture is grainy and looks non-professionally photographed, which I guess is the point if you&apos;re talking about previously unseen material.\n\nThe approach taken here is a bit unique as well. The narrative doesn&apos;t attempt to get into the history of the Beatles so much as it tries to track the disillusionment that came with fame and fortune, but with a distinct lack of privacy. In the span of two years, John, Paul, George and Ringo became the most well known and identified people on the planet, bringing with it chaos, death threats, plane crashes, diplomatic wrangles and ultimately, severe disillusionment. George was the first to vocalize his intent to quit the band, closely followed by John after their last performance at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on August 29th, 1966. No one realized at the time it would be their last live performance, and had it not been for a fan with a cine-camera at the event, there would have been no film footage of the event at all.\n\nThough there are brief clips of the Beatles doing interviews, the main principals on screen for this documentary were Beatles Press Officer Tony Barrow and their road manager Tony Bramwell. Journalist Larry Kane, who accompanied the Beatles on their third American tour also offers some insights. Their observations reinforced the idea that the performances the band gave revolutionized the music industry and inadvertently invented a new youth culture across the globe. Larry Kane made the point that fifteen minutes after the Candlestick Park show, an entirely new way of producing and promoting large scale concerts was born.\n\nSomething rather bizarre struck me concerning the flap caused by John Lennon&apos;s remarks concerning the Beatles&apos; popularity compared to Christianity. Everyone alive at the time had some thought about the controversy that ensued. The story here offered up the cover of &apos;DATEbook&apos; magazine from the mid-Sixties, quoting John who stated &quot;I don&apos;t know which will go first - rocknroll (the magazine&apos;s spelling) or Christianity&quot;. That&apos;s the comment that created such a stir back in the day, however right above it was a Paul McCartney quote - &quot;It&apos;s a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty n.....&quot;. I shook my head over that one, as I wondered how the tables might be reversed if the comments were made today. Interesting to speculate.\n\nOh yeah, there was one more quote on that DATEbook cover - Bob Dylan: &quot;Message songs are a drag&quot;. I sure wish I had that magazine.",

      "reviewBody": "If you can overcome what I can&apos;t, you will enjoy Beyond the Sea: Kevin Spacey is too old to play Bobby Darin, the 50&apos;s pop singer who died from long-term effects of rheumatic heart at 37. At times Spacey is playing Darin in his twenties when no matter how you tighten and pin Spacey&apos;s face, he is still a 44-year old man with all the lovely creases and bags time awards. The dislocation bothered me so that I couldn&apos;t fully appreciate what is otherwise an outstanding performance.\n\nBut then Spacey is the director, so he has to be responsible for miscasting (or put another way, why didn&apos;t he do this 10 years ago when no one on this planet could have denied that he is the perfect Darin?). As John Irving said in &quot;My Movie Business&quot; about the choice of actors, &quot;Looks do count.&quot; Although others have criticized Beyond the Sea as a Spacey vanity project, I found his performance believable and engaging with style appropriate to the best lounge singers of the time (Sinatra included) and spot-on perfect for Darin, if not better than the original. I&apos;ve heard Spacey is touring with his band to promote this biopic; I&apos;d go just to enjoy Spacey as a gifted singer.\n\nThe only moments to get past the many Darin songs and into his life are those centering on the influence of his &quot;mother&quot; (Brenda Blethyn, &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;) and his marriage to Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth). In the former, Blethyn does a bit of singing and dancing to show that Spacey is not the only multi-talent on the set. In the latter, the pop- culture lite of their romance is handled believably, as one might try to do David Beckham and his spicey love, a marriage just a vacuous and emblematic as the Darins&apos;.\n\nThe irony of Sandra&apos;s mother wanting her to go after Rock Hudson rather than Darin brings laughter, intended for sure, as the audience is aware of Spacey&apos;s contending with rumors about being gay. Even jokes about Darin&apos;s toupee resonate with Spacey&apos;s own rugs in real life and for this part. Spacey doesn&apos;t take himself as seriously as critics do (witness an early scene where in the framing device of Darin filming his own life, he is accused of being too old to play himself).\n\nThe conjunction of subject and biographer is challenging at best. Paul Murray Kendall in &quot;The Art of Biography&quot; says, &quot;On the trail of another man, the biographer must put up with finding himself at every turn: any biography uneasily shelters an autobiography within it.&quot; In that sense, Beyond the Sea is as much about Kevin Spacey as it is Bonny Darin.\n\nThis biopic ranks third next to Ray and De-Lovely; in another less-full year, it would be the best."

The entire film felt like someone intended it to be a mini series and they were forced to cut it to pieces in order to make it last only 100 minutes. The scenes are going one after another at what I hoped was an alert pace but turned out to be just bad (or forced) editing.\n\nI was actually looking forward to see a British disaster movie, one that would be a good one, not like those Hollywood violin pieces. It was a disastrous film alright, with every possible clich√© taken from all the American movies of the genre, but lacking in the directions where US productions shine: editing.\n\nBottom line: avoid. It is not funny, it is not emotional, not intelligent and not thrilling. Just plain boring.",

The German Democratic Republik was established in 1949. The Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit was established 1950 and grew to the biggest secret service worldwide for several years. The StaSi did not only work inside the GDR, it also had several actions in the Federal Republik of Germany and several other states. This very worthy ducumentation shows the crude methods, actions and issues of the former inner East-German secret service. It shows that the East-German states never reappraised the Nazi-past in public. So they didn&apos;t cope with the Third Reich and therefore the new problems of the raising far-right wing comes. Every German should have seen this. It&apos;s all told in a typical sober, German way. But that makes it all in all more authentic.",

Already in the beginning at the part where the space-shuttle exploded, I could clearly see it was fake. Not to mention the spider &apos;Mother in law&apos; itself... almost hilarious to see. It moved on like it was guided by strings and looked like it was made of plastic. This can be clearly seen in the part where &apos;mother-in-law&apos; crawls out of the astronaut&apos;s body and flees along the walls. The story itself isn&apos;t so thrilling either. A spider being injected by an alien DNA in space. God knows where that alien DNA came from. As far as I can tell, it wasn&apos;t told in the movie (maybe I fell asleep of boredom). No, next time it appears on television, I&apos;ll pass.",

Soon, a mysterious man (Helmut Dantine) shows up at a rural pub, seeming to have odd ideas and prescient knowledge, some of which is about Susan, who has gone missing.\n\nHe also has no pulse!\n\nWhen the authorities attempt to make him talk, they find it... difficult. Things only get weirder when Susan reappears. Of course, the government / military gets involved, and nearly makes a pig&apos;s breakfast of it all.\n\nSTRANGER FROM VENUS, like its -very similarly themed- cousin, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, is a more cerebral bit of cautionary sci-fi. No laser battles, monsters, or spaceship chases here. Dantine downplays his role, making the &quot;miracles&quot; he performs, and the words he speaks seem all the more believable. Ms. Neal is just as good in this as in that other, better-known film. Due to its budgetary constraints, most scenes are rather small in scope, making the dialogue quite important. This movie delivers excellent discourse and actually makes one think. Imagine that..."

      "reviewBody": "Director James Toback poses some heavy metaphysical questions to several armchair philosophers, including producer Joseph Kantner, to whom Toback is shown pitching his unusual idea for the film in a recurring sequence perhaps modeled as a parody of Louis Malle&apos;s &apos;My Dinner with Andr√©&apos;. Kantner&apos;s skepticism was obviously staged, but elsewhere the replies are invariably candid, coy, pragmatic, imaginative, and sometimes just plain eccentric. Each of the ten interviews reveals a fully human (in other words, somewhat flawed) character, all of them more interesting when recounting earthy anecdotes about sex or death than when pondering the infinite cosmos. Profound questions don&apos;t always guarantee like-minded responses, but the film is valuable for the way it prompts viewers to ask themselves the same questions. In the end it may be nothing more than a self-conscious, self-absorbed novelty item, but if nothing else Toback at least offered an offbeat antidote to all the megabuck summer schlockbusters then in release.",

      "reviewBody": "THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (RKO Radio, 1932), directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel, from the short story by Richard Connell, is a highly suspenseful drama with a neat twist in theme. But for the benefit for those who have never read Connell&apos;s original story nor seen the movie, this is something to really consider, especially for action and adventure fans. Categorized as a horror film, the only horror is the thought of a hunter being the hunted, especially by a crazed individual.\n\nThe story begins with an explosion and the sinking of a yacht with Robert Rainsford (Joel McCrea) becoming the sole survivor of the perished crew. He swims to safety on a remote island and soon encounters an ancient mansion where lives the Russian Count Zoroff (Leslie Banks), and his muted servant, Ivan (Noble Johnson) and Tatur (Steve Clemento). After getting into some dry clothes, Rainsford is introduced to Zoroff&apos;s other guests, Eve (Fay Wray) and her brother, Martin Trowbridge (Robert Armstrong), also shipwreck survivors. Gathering in the living room, Zoroff discusses his interest in game hunting, but instead of hunting animals, which now bores him, he hunts his new interest - a most dangerous game. Later that night, Zoroff has made the drunken Martin his latest prey, and after returning from his all night hunt, Zoroff shows Eve and Rainsford his trophy room, consisting of human heads and corpses, with Martin&apos;s body being among them. Because Rainsford is a noted author and hunter, Zoroff wants him to go game hunting with him, the hunting of man. Refusing to take part in his mad scheme, Rainsford, in turn, becomes Zoroff&apos;s next prey. Zoroff promises that if Rainsford eludes him until sunrise, he and Eve are set free, and if he doesn&apos;t, gets to recapture Eve alive, since he doesn&apos;t hunt the &quot;female animal.&quot; Being given a 12 hour head start for preparation, Rainsford, with Eve&apos;s help, works against time using his brains instead of his feet to try and outsmart the hunter, but after midnight, the hunt begins, with Zoroff&apos;s tracking them down with weapons ranging from bow and arrow, rifle, and, as the last resort, the release of his vicious dogs, climaxed by surprises for both hunter and the hunted.\n\nTHE MOST DANGEROUS GAME ranks one of the very best stories ever transferred on screen. In spite of alterations to Connell&apos;s original story, such as adding a female to accompany Rainsford, this adaptation is a fast-pace 65 minutes that never lets up for a minute. The first half hour devotes itself to character study, with Robert Armstrong&apos;s drunken performance somewhat slowing down the pace instead of providing humor. However, second half of the movie is tight on suspense, with the camera capturing every move and reaction from the three central characters, with Max Steiner&apos;s underscoring setting the mood and pace. Of course there&apos;s plenty of close calls and near misses to add to the excitement, making this a well staged and truly memorable experience after it is all over. What makes THE MOST DANGEROUSGAME worthy is the uncanny performance of British actor Leslie Banks, in his Hollywood debut, hamming it up to perfection, making his insane hunter come to life as intended by the author. Closeups of his eyes during the hunt is truly effective. If the jungle settings look familiar, it&apos;s the same set used for the much more famous adventure, KING KONG (RKO, 1933), that also features Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong.\n\nWhile Joel McCrea has been on screen since the silent era, starting from small roles to the elevation of leads, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME showcases him to best advantage, but cannot take away from the performance of Leslie Banks. While never a high rank leading man, McCrea did become a Hollywood survivor, better known for westerns, retiring from his successful career by 1962.\n\nTHE MOST DANGEROUS GAME was remade as A GAME OF DEATH (RKO, 1945) with John Loder and Edgar Barrier; RUN FOR THE SUN (United Artists, 1956) with Richard Widmark, and recycled numerous times, but none have captured the greatness to the 1932 original. It&apos;s also interesting to note that the theme was used as the basis in one of the better episodes to the comedy series, GILLIGAN&apos;S ISLAND, titled &quot;The Hunter&quot; with Rory Calhoun guest starring as the title character who hunts people, namely Gilligan (Bob Denver).\n\nOnce regarded a &quot;lost&quot; movie, a print of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME was discovered in the 1970s, and introduced to the small screen for the first time on public television in 1976. Prints shown in its initial premiere were crystal clear, but sadly, by the early 1980s, in the wake of home video, transfers circulated by distributors had that third to fourth generation look. A public domain title, it&apos;s unfortunate that a movie as good as this couldn&apos;t be available with better better picture quality. Aside from TV showings on various cable channels such as Nostalgia Television, and currently on some public TV stations after the midnight hours, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME had yet to be shown on any commercial free classic movie channels until Turner Classic Movies aired it on June 28, 2007, but because of its reputation, continues to circulate in the VHS and DVD markets to a very favorable audience. An instant classic not to be missed. (***)",

They were able to blend both the series and the movies together pretty well. The ending on the DVD is better than the theater ending. Though I felt they could have went into a bit more detail. A few important scenes were cut, buy or rent the DVD and you&apos;ll see what I&apos;m talking about. The plot and story line are well put together, it made me think and question life in general.\n\nAdrian Pual really shines and gets to show his skill. He is a great martial artist and does help with setting up the fight scenes. Donnie Yen is awesome and is a good match for Adrian. Chris Lambert does a good job, he is the original Highlander. You can see his age showing through, like the rest of us he is only mortal, it happens.\n\nIf you are a fan of the series you may be a little saddened with the small parts Methos and Joe(Peter Wingfield and Jim Byrnes) got. I would have liked to see Methos come to life, maybe even a fight scene with one of Kells&apos; followers. Joe has some screen time, but more would have added that much more to the story.\n\nAll in all, I love this movie. Even with its faults, hey were only mortals!"

It must have had something, I am still thinking about it 15 years on.\n\nI can recall the place, day and my mood when I went to see the movie. Glasgow, cold and wet, mood BAD.\n\nThese days I have my own enclosed garden with fruit trees. Often when I am watering the garden, the movie comes to mind.\n\nMy rating is 10/10 because it did what movies can do, accompanied me for many years.\n\nI am sure that now I am older and more patient I will one day see the rest of the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I gave this an enthusiastic 6, and that&apos;s not said sarcastically.  If you accept it for what it is, a WWII propaganda film, it is (except for the last half hour) very well done.  It was made within the constraints of being a propaganda film, the necessity to maintain dramatic flow, incomplete knowledge at the time of all the facts, and the availability of aircraft that the Army Air Corps could provide.  The aircraft are clearly the best thing about the film, though Harry Carey came close to stealing the movie. The aerial battles were staged by Paul Mantz, who was THE best in the business.  There were two major weaknesses.  The first was the frequent references to 5th column activity.  Except for one minor incident in the Kauai area, the Japanese-Americans in Hawaii were singularly loyal to the U.S.  The biggest weakness was the totally fictitious battle in the last 30 minutes of the movie.  It never happened.  The only sea battle in that area during that time frame was the battle of the Java Sea, which was a disaster for the U.S. and Dutch forces.  Rather it seemed to be an enhanced composite of the attacks on Japanese convoys in the New Guinea/Solomon Islands area, and the battles of Coral Sea and Midway.  We had nothing like the forces portrayed available at that time.  The fighters shown at Clark Field were Bell P-39s.  They were very pretty little planes, but were such a disappointment they earned the nickname Iron Dogs (all metal and &quot;dogs&quot;). But they still would have been far superior to what was actually available there.  Sharp-eyed viewers would see that they were also used to stand in for radial-engined Zeroes (P-39s had liquid-cooled engines), along with radial-engined American trainers in the battle scenes.  Also, I am practically certain B-17s didn&apos;t have the range to fly from Hickam to Clark with only one refueling stop, but that is justified by the necessity for dramatic flow.  One more note - the dramatic picture of the capsizing battleship near the end of the movie was not a model, but rather a film of the Austro-Hungarian Szent Istvan sunk in 1918 during WWI.",

The policemen realize that something has to be done... and soon they&apos;re in deep trouble. I recommend it! 4.5/5",

It&apos;s pretty simple but what you have to watch out for here is Walter Hill&apos;s visual and editorial style which was probably the best around in the eighties.\n\nThere isn&apos;t any Oscar-worthy performances here but there was never meant to be none - Michael Pare does well with his limited John Wayne modelled role, Rick Moranis shows that he can play much more than the &quot;nerdy-neurotic&quot; character that made him world famous in the early nineties, William Defoe plays a better villain in this than he did in Spiderman and Diane Lane shows that she was once, the hottest woman in Hollywood (she still ain&apos;t too bad today!).\n\nThis film deserves more credit, votes, attention and DVD extra&apos;s than it presently has - definitely one of the best film&apos;s of the eighties.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this 1952 movie. It never tried to be anything but what it was. Shipwreck, stranded on an island, beautiful Linda Darnell and handsome young Tab Hunter in his first film. The star never looked better and the story was not difficult to understand. Enter Donald Gray as the other part of the triangle and you have conflict amongst the natives.\n\nLinda Darnell, every inch a movie star, graced the screen with her alluring and dark looks. She never gives you the idea of anything else but what she is. True better films came her way, but listen, just watching the glamor of the star system was enough in those days. See her in LETTER TO THREE WIVES or UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM, even that clinker FOREVER AMBER for more meaty roles. But sometimes it&apos;s refreshing to see that stars as themselves in romantic and sometimes far fetched plots. Remember in the 40s and 50s the studios ruled the films and the stars. It was their mission to expose their glamor and popularity. How many films did it take for Elizabeth Taylor to turn into a decent actress?\n\nTab Hunter took a lot of slack for this film from the critics. But the studios had other thoughts in mind and thankfully they took him under their wings and turned him into a top teen aged heart throb. He too learned his craft along the way. Watch him in GUNMAN&apos;S WALK, BATTLE CRY, THE AROUSERS and LUST IN THE DUST. He again was just a pleasure to watch on the screen with his blonde hair good looks and well toned physique.\n\nIt was the time of the stars. It was their films, their popularity and faithful fans that kept the movies alive in those days. Now days it&apos;s the violence and spectacle that hold court in films. Sadly, the days of glamor have long gone. And the stars with them.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Kabei Our Mother",
      "reviewBody": "My introduction into Yoji Yamada&apos;s cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai, The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor. I had enjoyed all three films, and looking at the prolific, veteran director&apos;s filmography, I think it&apos;ll take me a very long while to watch all his films, especially the Tora-san series. Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores, I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere, celebrating their innate love for their children.\n\nBased on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami, Kabei - Our Mother tells of a close knit family of four ‚Äì Mother Kayo &quot;Kabei&quot; (Sayuri Yoshinaga), Father Shigeru &quot;Tobei&quot; (Mitsugoro Bando), eldest daughter Hatsu (Mirai Shida) and youngest child Teru (Miku Sato). From the get go their lives would be changed forever, when Shigeru gets arrested under the Peace Preservation Law for his morally controversial writings against the nation, set in the late 30s where Japan had begun their &quot;crusade&quot; in China, and thereafter their participation in WWII.\n\nSo begins Kabei&apos;s struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family, and the frequent, difficult meetings with her husband behind bars. Help comes from relatives, especially on Shigeru&apos;s side, since Kabei&apos;s own dad had adopted an &quot;I told you so&quot; attitude with her choice of spouse. Shigeru&apos;s one time student Yama (arthouse buffs should recognize Tadanobu Asano here) provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children, and Kabei&apos;s sister in law Hisako (Rei Dan) from Hiroshima, which I believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.\n\nWhile the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom, and in a distant relationship with their dad, what I enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in Japan. It&apos;s against the historical backdrop of Japan&apos;s push to regional dominance, and there are characters here that don&apos;t mask those ambitions, even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands. This is something I rarely see in Japanese films, being that frank in their discussion of that era, and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.\n\nThe actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles, be they the veterans or the child actors. Actress Sayuri Yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances, while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise. Each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough, or fill your heart with Joy should they be celebrating. Before long you&apos;ll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family, thanks to the primary cast&apos;s powerful performances, with Yoji Yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids.\n\nKabei - Our Mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction, and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top, or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience. There are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect, with every scene not being wasted, and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across, be it compassion or love.\n\nAside from the very abrupt ending (I had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more, despite its more than 2 hours runtime), Kabei Our Mother comes highly recommended, and you&apos;ll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears, or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis. Just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder, then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you&apos;d probably have taken for granted.",

The movie is very fast paste and every single moment is enjoyable to watch.\n\nAjay Devgan and the main Villain is Top Notch...both of them does a very good job. The new girl is cute to look at, and she does do her acting OK.\n\nThe only minus in the movie is the songs, there is not one single song which touch ur heart, or U feel like listening to again.\n\nFor me Singham is so far the best movie of 2011, and a big thanks for everyone involved from Directing to writing to give us a Damn Good Movie.",

Sophia Loren had just scored a hit in &apos;L&apos;Oro di Napoli&apos; under Vittorio de Sica&apos;s direction and by all accounts he is still the &apos;guiding hand&apos; here. De Sica himself is as always immaculate whilst Sordi and Vallone never disappoint. It is the performance of Franca Valeri in probably her greatest role as the forlorn, luckless-in-love Cesira that steals the show. Valeri also had a hand in the script as the film was originally intended to be directed by Comencini and built around the character of the same name that she had created on radio and television. Comencini pulled out and the Risi-de Sica-Loren triumvirate moved in. Valeri still manages to come out best however. She was to excel in &apos;Il Vedovo&apos; three years later for the same director. The most striking and unusual credit is that of the Production Designer: a certain Carl Theodor Dreyer!",

I was totally blown away.\n\nBelieve it or not, this film actually flows like a story. A young couple, a king and queen termite, settle down and build a grand empire within a massive mound. When the mound suffers damage from rain, fire, and a falling branch, the scent from the termite colony is carried off by wind and catches the attention of a swarming driver ant colony led by their &quot;black queen.&quot; Now a war is waged as ant and termite fight a battle of minuscule proportions for the survival of their very colonies.\n\nI was amazed on how well made this was. It was action packed and, surprisingly, emotionally compelling. You actually feel for the termites that live in the colony as they struggle and battle for survival while the driver ants are given a rather menacing atmosphere that is complemented by the music. The intricate camera work used to film all this is to be commended.\n\nWith the narrator being my only, and minor, gripe, this is probably the best documentary I have ever seen in my entire life. Check out this wonderful film and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, let&apos;s all agree that voicing dialogue for a young ape is sappy. It&apos;s something maybe only a Tim Allen can pull off. But once you get into the mood, this movie is a superb tale of hope for a virtually unknown -- and endangered -- member of the ape family. \n\nFollowing the capture, recovery, and sanctuary life of Beny, a bonobo whose mother was shot by poachers, the movie both moved me and made me laugh, all while enlightening me on the traits that make bonobos special. I think the writers did an excellent job, for the most part, at interpreting the bonobo behaviors, to make it real for viewers. I was bothered that they referred to apes as &quot;monkeys&quot; several times, but that may have been an (ill-advised) effort to relate to an animal that people recognize. (The great apes -- gorillas, chimps, orangutans, and bonobos -- are not monkeys.)\n\nClaudine, the human &quot;mother&quot; who started the sanctuary, is indeed an angel. She is beautiful, and I loved watching the bonobos love her. Apes can tell the difference between friends and frauds, and the beautiful shots of the bonobos playing with her show the strong bonds between them.\n\nThis is a lovely movie for children. The producers made a deliberate decision, it appears, to skip over all the bonobo sex stuff, and focus on &quot;hugs.&quot; Note, they will have to be old enough to read quickly, because the movie is in French, with English subtitles.",

I confess I didn&apos;t recognize Joan Bennett.\n\nThe story concerns hard-working, dedicated psychiatrists McCrea and Colbert who have to deal with a new head of the hospital, a man who believes women have no place in psychiatry. The title comes from a quote by McCrea, that there is no difference between sanity and insanity - everyone lives in their own private world.\n\nThere is a subplot - the philandering McCrea, fooling around with Boyer&apos;s sister (Vinson), and a growing attraction between Colbert and Boyer.\n\nI don&apos;t think I have ever seen Boyer so young, and he reminded me of Alain Delon.\n\nGood movie, recommending a humane approach to the mentally ill.",

      "name": "One of Rivette&apos;s best from the 80&apos;s.",
      "reviewBody": "I think the reason that Rivette is the least popular -- yet by far the most secret, profound and precious -- of the New Wave directors is that he can&apos;t be pinned down to a belief. He isn&apos;t political, though corporate conspiracies are a factor in many of his films; he isn&apos;t an occultist, though his films are filled with Zodiacal symbols, the tarot, magicians; he isn&apos;t interested in putting humans under the microscope like Rohmer, though he is minutely attentive to what breaks people apart and brings them together. No; rather, politics, the occult, and humanity are like the vines tying together the raft through which he floats in the void. They are methods to generate material, curiosity and, as lit students would say, a narrative where none necessarily exists. I hope I&apos;m making this clear -- Rivette actually LONGS FOR a worldwide political conspiracy, preferably controlled by a dark magus operating from some deceptively plain apartment in Paris, with the whole human comedy under his spell, because he knows that the alternative, what most people call &quot;reality,&quot; would be soul death. He wants more mystery, more confusion, more action. Unlike Godard, he isn&apos;t looking for utopias, certainly not those that can be brought about by politics; he wants the world to be as it is, in all its unfathomable, malevolent, messy beauty.\n\nAs Jean-Pierre Kalfon says in L&apos;Amour Par Terre ¬ñ one of Rivette&apos;s most insidious and fascinating films, by the way -- &quot;I don&apos;t want to make life better than it is; I want life.&quot; Rivette, like many filmmakers who have disavowed their faith, has really only sublimated his religious quest. His obsession with the creative process, its false starts, abrupt detours and unknown destinations, is unmistakably of a spiritual nature. As it turns out, he is obsessed with stories because the world as we know it exists in order to contain them. For Rivette, God is not an obscure savior ( what are we being saved from? ) but a generator of fictional material, the ultimate creative artist. If the other world is defined by its permanence, its frozen perfection, this one must contain everything that can possibly exist, and the human artist, such as Rivette, then becomes like a sort of middleman between heaven and earth -- he gives form to the transitory, thus translating it for eternity.\n\nRivette&apos;s &quot;strangeness&quot; can be boiled down to his attempt to mirror God&apos;s mind by disavowing any ultimate truth. God requires stories in order not to be bored; stories require a world ruled by space and time where they can play out in a bounded setting, with a beginning and end; the world requires life in order to act out these stories. Stories, in short, require that we die. The two words that best describe Rivette&apos;s movies, &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;childlike,&quot; come from the fact that, to accept that we are in a virtual, fictional realm, you must become as naive as a child for whom death is not real, yet who is subconsciously haunted by what it might mean. We die, but only because we&apos;re in a play. We die as children, but the curtain eventually rises ( he finally gives us a peek at what&apos;s behind it in his presumably final film, Marie et Julien. ) All this and more is part of why Rivette is so successful at blending the occult and the everyday ¬ñ there is nothing more occult than the fact that we&apos;re here at all, pretending we know what we&apos;re doing."

As going through (excuse the pun) a few sexy German hotties (wunderbar) and notties, we see their frustrations and anguish&apos;s and mistakes, and really in the process and learning, nothing new, which really made for some painfully pathetic moments. There are first times, not so first times, as well as an unforeseen rape, from a few young horny stud campers, where this girl kind of gets chided by her gynecologist. This is pretty shallow as an educational film, but like others of this type, is this just a facade for it being a sex show? We didn&apos;t really see much of which a gynecologist does either, although there were a couple of moments, some that got, up close and personal, with &quot;Did we really see that&quot; images. &quot;Why do they make these films?&quot; was a question that went through my head. That may well be the question that goes through your head, when you watch it. Nice music though.",

(She was always seeking him as her screen partner!) But Taylor delivers the goods--great charm, presence and obviously respecting the fine role that he plays. Vivien Leigh is a revelation--here she is fresh from Scarlett O&apos;Hara and able to inhabit another character&apos;s skin with ease, back in her oh-so-British mode and looking as young and beautiful as ever. It&apos;s a pleasure that two such charismatic stars are still being seen in this--their finest moments on screen in one of the greatest tear-jerkers of the &apos;40s. Special mention should be given to Lucille Watson for the way she plays the restaurant scene with Leigh at their first meeting--the mother-in-law getting the wrong impression from Leigh&apos;s reception. All of it is romantic, tender and charming--with an Anna Karenina-like ending after a surprising twist. For fans of Taylor and Leigh, it doesn&apos;t get any getter than this."

So I guess Mastroianni was satisfied.\n\nThe problem is that this movie doesn&apos;t really know where is going, as I say it looks like the love story is the main theme here, but soon it turns into some kind of documentary about painless births, pregnancies and more stuff about maternity (I know, it sounds absurd). The film is watchable because of the two main characters who have real chemistry (after all is Mastroianni we&apos;re talking about) and some moments really well done, but more than a feature film it looks like an educational film for pregnant women. An advice: forget about 80 % of the movie and focus in the love story, there lies what&apos;s good about it.",

      "reviewBody": "... such as what happened to the Bouvier/Beale money that bought the 28 room mansion that mother and daughter live in and is in disrepair? I know that Big Edie was divorced in 1931, and it sounded like &quot;little Edie&quot; had the advantages of an expensive education through college, which would have been right before WWII. What changed? There is no narration here, nor do the documentary makers ask questions. They just let the cameras roll and record whatever happens. Big Edie is in her late 70s yet retains a kind of beauty. However, she talks over little Edie whenever they are in the same room, making it difficult to understand either woman.\n\nWhat is clear visually is that they are both living in squalor. A cat defecates behind a very old portrait of Big Edie and both Edies laugh about being glad somebody gets to do what they want? Nobody tries to clean it up. Big Edie spends her time on a filthy mattress with stuff she might need stacked on top, yet seems to have no trouble with mobility. They make food for the cameramen including pate on crackers that looks like cat food on crackers. I would want a tetanus shot first.\n\nLittle Edie has a mountain of regret. She talks about how she wanted to be a dancer, how somebody wanted to marry her but her mother drove him away, and how she has been taking care of her mother due to her health on and off since the second world war. She mentions how much she hates the country and misses the noise of the city. Little Edie is remarkably well preserved. When this film was made she was 56 but she could pass for forty. She color coordinates all of her wardrobes including her scarves and headdresses that hide her alopecia, yet she won&apos;t mop the floor. Shades of faded feelings of being aristocracy perhaps? \n\nAnother question I had that went unanswered was where were big Edie&apos;s sons? Both lived into the 1990&apos;s, yet they are nowhere to be found. Maybe they had the sense to get out of Dodge.\n\nWhy are these recluses the subject of a documentary in the first place? Because big and little Edie are Jackie Kennedy Onnasis&apos; aunt and cousin, respectively, and because Suffolk County was trying to evict them based on the condition of the house and grounds - there was no running water at one point - until Jackie supplied the funds to get the estate up to snuff.\n\nDon&apos;t look for lots of answers here, because there are really none. It is just a fascinating portrait of two recluses who have slipped into their own form of normality although it looks horrifying to outsiders.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is a fictionalised re-narration of director and co-author Peter Jessen&apos;s experience of being dragged to a rural commune by his drop-out mother, and as such it&apos;s probably a lot more accurate than a docu-miniseries about the beginnings of the alternative/eco movement -- viz, the Mueslis, as they were so cruelly and accurately dubbed in German. Jessen achieves this by eschewing the two pitfalls of this genre, smarmy those-were-the-days nostalgia and cheap ridicule of a bunch of folks who were, at the very least, active idealists, albeit in often very smelly socks.\n\n(Tidbit information for neophytes: Why didn&apos;t they just wash the damn socks? Well, sheep wool was considered to be so vibrantly, wholesomely natural that not only does it clean itself, but you would actually be destroy its magical self-cleaning properties by placing them in the suds. I&apos;m not making this up -- my mother had apparently read the same book, which afforded me olfactory properties that didn&apos;t exactly enhance my social standing among my peers.)\n\nThe acting is absolutely exceptional down to the minor characters, and overall it&apos;s a wonderfully understated movie. It expects you to bring a lot of curiosity and a modicum of sympathy along, though -- if you think hippies are a bunch of commie bleeding-heart tree-huggers then you are probably better off watching something else -- Dallas, for instance."

      "reviewBody": "When &quot;troubled teens&quot; are embroiled in gangs (ONCE UPON A TIME IN America) or drugs (TRAINSPOTTING, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM), it is a life decision, a commitment to those lifestyles that drives their drama.\n\nIn the Norwegian film, TROUBLED WATER, a teen commits one thoughtless act that has life-shaking consequences long after he tries to atone for it. He was not driven to it by desire for money, addiction, or broken family, just one lapse in judgment.\n\nP√•l Sverre Valheim Hagen won a Norwegian film award for this breakout role as Jan Thomas, who, as a teen, kidnaps a 5-year-old boy. We catch up with Jan in his early 20s, as he completes his sentence in a juvenile jail. We learn he is a principled, sensible guy and a talented organist. He still has flashbacks of that fateful day (that reveal ever more harrowing details) but he wants to put it behind him as he starts a job as a church organist.\n\nJan seems to find his feet, the church job including an apartment, a bike, welcoming staff (like Terje Str√∏mdahl, who asserts &quot;if he can&apos;t get a second chance here, then where?&quot;) - and a female priest hot enough to be in ABBA (Ellen Dorrie Petersen as Anna, in her second film role). And Jan gets to rock out with his stops out.\n\nUntil the mother of the kidnapped boy recognizes him.\n\nAgnes (veteran Norwegian actress Trine Dyrholm), still mourning her son, mother to two other daughters and a husband who looks like Bjorn Borg (Trond Espen Seim) realizes who Jan is as he performs a stirring version of Simon And Garfunkel&apos;s Bridge Over Troubled Water.\n\nErik Poppe (Scandanavian Director of the Year 1994) constructs this tale (written by Harald Rosenl√∏w-Eeg) out of chronological order. As details of Jan&apos;s crime are revealed, so too is Agnes&apos;s life of subsuming pain for the sake of her family, now opening scabs that will seemingly never heal.\n\nOur allegiances keep flipping from Jan to Agnes and we end up wondering if there is any right resolution to this horrible escalating drama. We are shown every nuanced side of human reaction, from both sides: anger, denial, emptiness, vengeance, warmth, fear, loss of innocence.\n\nAs Jan&apos;s life coalesces into couplehood with the hot priest and her own 5-year-old, Jens (Fredrik Gr√∏ndahl), Agnes is resolute in destroying that relationship completely, to make him feel the loss that he made her feel.\n\nOutside the American system, TROUBLED WATER doesn&apos;t need to conform to any arc of redemption. The sun almost shines for Jan, then the waters get dark and cloudy. Wade in...",

      "description": "Jan, recently released from prison after serving time for the murder of a child, has always maintained his innocence and is ready to put the past behind him. A gifted organist, he takes a job at an Oslo church under his middle name, Thomas. His talent and gentle manner quickly earn him the respect of his superiors, as well as the love of the pastor, Anna. Thomas even overcomes his initial panic to return the affection of Anna&apos;s young son, Jens. But his past catches up with him when Agnes, a local teacher, comes to the church on a school visit and recognizes the organist as Jan, the young man who was convicted for the murder of her son. ",

      "reviewBody": "The names of three of the actors in this film are probably not very well known today, Wendell Corey, Don Taylor and Nicole Maurey. Mickey Rooney, who is I hope remembered rightly got an Oscar for his role, and the film is extremely good because of its balanced and well written screenplay. The director is unknown to me, and Mickey Rooney directed himself in a gambling scene, and that scene alone is worthy of the best of Howard Hawks. The film is set towards the end of WW2 in Italy, and the first half is a psychological journey for three soldiers and a woman who has turned to prostitution to survive. She falls in love with a preacher, at first against his religious beliefs and when he discovers her past his disgust overwhelms him, and there are consequences to this for the men who serve under him. No spoilers but the love scenes when he is temporarily transformed by love are beautifully acted and moving to watch. Don Talor plays the preacher and Nicole Maurey the woman who needs love, and not to be used. Wendell Corey is brilliant as a man who cannot kill, and his psychological development is accurate and again moving. The latter part of the film is grim in its war scenes, and the futility of war is admirably conveyed. I am not a fan of most War films, but this joins the handful that I do admire and respect. I would give it a ten if it was not for the final words onscreen, focussing too much on cowardice and bravery. These men are just there, doing their best in a theatre of war and suffering, and in this film, it is the analysis of their inner selves that is paramount. The same story could have been equally told from the other side. Well worth seeing.",

This little boy, Mason Gamble (who won the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actor Leading Role in a Motion Picture Comedy in this film) is amazing at such a young age. This movie brings the comic strip alive MUCH better than the old TV show ever did. Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s music is perfect, Walter Matthau perfectly portrays the grumpy old Mr. Wilson in a way he couldn&apos;t even achieve in Grumpy Old Men. In fact, I have no problem proclaiming he has never been funnier. Christopher Lloyd is pure genius as an evil thief. I won&apos;t spoil it at all, but trust me when I say that Dennis the Menace manages make life miserable for Mr. Wilson and others, and comes out squeaky clean, as a child hero like him must. WATCH IT, BE IN A GOOD MOOD, AND YOU WILL LLOOVVEE IT! (Of course, if you naturally just don&apos;t like one of the actors in the movie or come with some other sort of bias, I can&apos;t help you.)",

      "reviewBody": "Paul Wendkos is an average director at best, but has the ability to turn a potentially terrible movie into a satisfying action flick. &quot;Attack on the Iron Coast&quot; is yet another low-budget entry in a series from Oakmont Production, and although it presents nothing new, but holds attention so well that the clich√©s are easy to overlook.\n\nJohn C. Champion&apos;s script is a fictional takeoff on a real WWII event, much like his earlier and much worse &quot;Submarine X-1&quot;. This time, the story is based on Mountbatten&apos;s raid on the dry dock at St. Nazaire, in which a ship laden with explosives crashed into the repair dock and destroyed important German repair facilities.\n\nLloyd Bridges (&quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot;) plays Major Wilson (a takeoff on Lord Mountbatten), who&apos;s first commando mission in France turns into a shambles. But he is given a second chance when he plans an even riskier operation to destroy the German repair dock at LeClair (Ste-Nazaire). The only problem is that Captain Franklin (Andrew Keir, &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;) is opposed to the mission from the start, and the two must cooperate as the mission is a joint Army-Navy operation.\n\nThis film is really a mixed bag. What&apos;s good is really, really good and what&apos;s bad is really, really bad. Lloyd Bridges gives a sincere performance as Major Wilson, but his character isn&apos;t developed as much as I would have liked. We&apos;re treated two a two-dimensional hero who doesn&apos;t have any weaknesses; he brings to mind John Wayne&apos;s Colonel Kirby of &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. His conflict with Franklin is the core of the movie and provides enough tension that the German enemies aren&apos;t needed until the final act.\n\nThe German characters are disappointing. We&apos;re treated to some very shallow characterizations which bring to mind the worst excesses of &quot;Hogan&apos;s Heroes&quot;. The officers sit and watch dirty movies and become sated on fine wine and liquor while their subordinates bring in urgent reports of an approaching enemy ship. This is very unfortunate, because both George Mikell and Walter Gotell are very capable German actors who have had very good roles in the past - chiefly, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, where they acted together in 1961. This really let me down. It would have been wiser to exclude German characters altogether and dwell on the commandos some more.\n\nThe action sequences are withheld until the final 20 minutes or so of the film and range from well-crafted to laughable. Scenes of British commandos dashing about in alleyways and dockyards are excellently staged and well-shot, even if they&apos;re very generic. The scenes of British minesweeper in the bay, however, feature some of the worst miniature work of the period. It&apos;s obvious that this feature had a low budget, because they aren&apos;t many extras or realistic explosions in the entire film.\n\nWendkos manages to keep things interesting by moving his camera fluidly and often shooting from high or low angles, giving the audience a unique perspective on the dialogue or action. The sets are all-top notch and the exteriors are very well-decorated. The German dockyard is expansive and really has a fresh, authentic feel to it and the various British war offices are equally believable.\n\n&quot;Attack on the Iron Coast&quot; is nothing more than a routine, satisfying 90-minute film. There is nothing fresh and unique about it, but some fair acting and fast pace keep it engaging.",

Lee (A Moment to Remember) about South Korean student unit of 71 soldiers who was left to defend the girls middle school during the Battle of Pohang during the peek of North Korea&apos;s invasion of South in 1950. That 71 students defended that position for 11 hours against a North Korean army brigade and the film was inspired by the letters of one of that soldiers. Out of 71 members of the unit, only three had combat experience, while others have not undergone any training before the battle, which makes their resistance unbelievable.\n\nThe story focuses on two soldiers, Oh Jung-Bum, frightened and lost commander of the unit who only got the position because of his experience that was minimal, and Ku Kap-Jo, convicted of murder who enlisted in the Army to avoid jail. A good part of the story rests on their conflict and on development of their relationship as well as their relationship with the rest of the unit. Character development is uncommonly done. Oh Jung-Bum changes from a scared kid who couldn&apos;t even shot from the gun to brave commander absurdly fast, while Ku Kap-Jo&apos;s path is approximately opposite and just as fast, if not faster. In this context, we can mention the North Korean captain Park Mu-Rang which is extremely difficult to characterize as he&apos;s almost like another character in almost every scene, while only he&apos;s egotism stays.\n\nPerformance is standard Asian, full of melodrama, highlighting the pride and courage, and a somewhat caricature acting that is pretty solid here. Cha Seung-won is far form being brilliant in lead role of Oh Jung-Bum, almost completely without emotions, as if he was forced to act in this movie. The rest of the acting team did a solid job. The pace of storytelling is perfect, not one scene is redundant, although movie could work without humorous parts they deliver, alongside humor, additional characterization of the characters. It&apos;s a simple, dynamic story with which time goes by quickly. There&apos;s no objections to the visual part of the film. A solid budget of 10mil dollars was well used, the effects look almost authentic. Final battle looks really impressive, although it can not be overlooked that it was somewhat idealized.\n\nFilm lacks historical context which is not surprising given that, as usually happens with Far Eastern cinema, it&apos;s made for their market so they didn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s necessarily to explain situation, but however, it does not affect much on the experience of the film since the theme is universal, and 71: Into the Fire is one of the better war movies lately.",

      "name": "Starts off fantastic, but then goes way south after the first half hour",
      "reviewBody": "I saw a preview for this movie and happened to find it on an old VHS while glancing the thrift stores. When I first saw the trailer with Molly Ringwald and Robert Downey Jr., I figured the movie had to be pretty good. I love Ringwald&apos;s work in the John Hughes films, and just like Downey in general so I thought I was in for a really funny, warm treat. Add to the cast Dennis Hopper, fresh off of an Oscar nod from the previous year&apos;s Hoosier&apos;s as well as Danny Aiello, Bob Gunton (warden Norton from my all time fave &quot;The Shawshank Redemption) and Harvey Keitel, and you got what seems like a really fun comedy with a powerhouse cast. \n\nAnd it starts off that way, but it takes some seriously wrong turns after the first half-hour and just gets progressively worse to the point where I wanted to take my eyes off the TV set. The so called &quot;story&quot; is very lame once the premise is established. Downey plays his usual sarcastic, self-centered character, who happens to be a womanizer here, who tries to put all of his smooth moves on Ringwald (what guy in the 80&apos;s wouldn&apos;t have tried though?). She at first is uninterested but he is her only saving grace when gangster Keitel and his hit men, kidnap Hopper playing Ringwald&apos;s father, and Downey is forced to come up with the ransom money to save Hopper and ultimately Ringwald&apos;s lives. \n\nThe problem here is with this fantastic cast, the story and characters should be much more interesting and likable, not bland and generic like it is here. The movie would have been better with Downey&apos;s character being the same and leaving more room for character development getting to know both he Ringwald&apos;s characters better and taking them on another crazy adventure rather than the stupid mob sub-plot that is the focus here. Ringwald also seems like she&apos;s trying too hard to be an adult actress here, and not be typecast-ed with her typical teen roles from her tenure with Hughes. Taking this approach however is not successful, as her character here is bland and unlikable. The movie would have been much better here, if she would have played a character similar to the ones she did in &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; or &quot;Pretty in Pink.&quot; When actors try hard to be different than their usual persona, they come across as unlikable and that&apos;s definitely the case with Ringwald here. Maybe if John Hughes would have directed this, it would have been a different, and certainly much better movie. \n\nAlso, the supporting cast is entirely wasted and all characters are underdeveloped. Hopper seems like he is doing a much more comical version of his character from &quot;Hoosiers&quot; here, and it gets rather annoying quite quickly, especially considering he played the same character exactly a year before and did it much better then. He is also given very little to do, and the fact he receives screen credit is ridiculous, this could have easily been an extended cameo, and a bad one at that. What a waste of Hopper&apos;s fine talent. Fortunately we have better movies in his career before and after this to remember him by like &quot;Easy Rider,&quot; &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Speed&quot;. \n\nKeitel is also annoying here, playing his usual tough-guy role, and he forces it so much that after a while it just becomes plain laughable. That role works for other movies but doesn&apos;t cut it here. He is wasted here, and given a bad role. Even Joe Pesci or Danny De Vito would have been better suited for this part, and could have brought some humor and originality to the character. Keitel plays it so straight that it&apos;s just painful to watch. The character is irritating and extremely one-dimensional. Didn&apos;t the director tell him this was a comedy before he signed on? \n\nGunton, a fine character actor is also wasted here and given nothing to do, same for Aiello. And then of course, there&apos;s Downey who puts a lot of effort into his character, but acts as if he knows the script stinks and aims to do his best with it. Downey does a generally good job, and gives the movie some saving grace, but this character would be suited better with another script and in another movie. \n\nAll in all the movie is very forgettable and wastes it&apos;s fine cast, who deserved a much better script, story and direction than what they got.",

      "reviewBody": "Kent Taggart&apos;s family, with their cattle stampeded, are killed by those who started it. In a fair gunfight, he kills the man&apos;s son responsible for it all and is on the run. Before the rancher dies he hires three bounty hunters headed by Dan Duryea to avenge him with the promise of $5000 as a reward. Taggart must flee into Apache territory to escape the wrath of the trio of hired killers.\n\nBased on a Louis L&apos;amour novel, this western moves at a steady clip, getting into one perilous situation to the next - it has the right modicum of action and drama. There&apos;s some decent performances from Dan Duryea as the hired gunslinger out to kill the hero Tony Young. Dan is at his usual manic self, oozing with reptilian glee and saying dry one liners. Dick Foran as a miner and Elsa Cardenas as his opportunistic wife also turn in decent performances. Yes there&apos;s some mismatched stock footage during the action sequences, but it isn&apos;t too bad. Overall a solid western with some fine twists.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: My Girlfriend Can See Ghosts",
      "reviewBody": "What would happen if the little boy in The Sixth Sense, who has this gift of seeing and ultimately interacting with ghosts, was to grow up? It&apos;s probably something that Son Ye Jin&apos;s character of Yeo-Ri would have experienced, being left alone and ostracized by many because of this ability that will spook just about anyone. It&apos;s little wonder why this Korean beauty was made to look doom, gloom and glum in the first half of the film, being as miserable as can be because she has no friends, and family has shun her, preferring to live a life of safety thousands of miles away.\n\nWritten and directed by Hwang In-Ho, who was responsible for one of my favourite films then in Two Faces of My Girlfriend, his latest film takes the romantic comedy genre and fuses it with a very effective horror element, though at times making it seem like watching a film with two separate, schizophrenic identities rolled into one. It&apos;s a good thing that both parts are equally strong, with the romantic comedy element being very much dripped in saccharine sweetness, and the horror element dipping into the bag of tricks with the usual jump cuts to scare, coupled with realistic, scary makeup and costumes that will make you flinch in your seat and turn your gaze away from the screen.\n\nThe strength of the film is in its story, throwing us into the deep end with magician Jo-Goo (Lee Min-Ki) being mesmerized by a strangely glum looking lass Yeo-Ri, having her demeanour inspire a hugely successful horror box illusion perfected to bring in the dough. Recruiting her for his magic company, the troupe never really got any opportunity to get her to join in their post-work drinking session, only because she harbours a secret that she intends to keep under wraps, one that involves periodic visits by spirits from the netherworld seeking her help in their unfinished business, and a prolonged spooking by a mysterious long haired ghoul whose identity intertwines closely with Yeo-Ri&apos;s tragic past, intricately linked with her supernatural ability.\n\nIn-Ho creates likable leading characters in both Jo-Goo and Yeo-Ri as the inevitable lovebirds who have to overcome obstacles placed in their path toward a relationship. After all, the main ghoul at play is adamant in making Yeo-Ri&apos;s life as miserable as possible. You&apos;ll soon find yourself rooting for the two to get together, and In-Ho&apos;s story provides spectrum for the usual boy-meets-girl and the follow up scenarios to happen. The romanticism here extends also toward Yeo-Ri&apos;s seeking of help from pals over the phone as they serve as her only friends who do keep their arms length for a period. And who better to play Yeo-Ri than the Son Ye-Jin, sharing great chemistry opposite Lee Min-Ki as they battle the crazy odds thrown at their characters.\n\nAnd as mentioned, this film is pretty much strong in its horror aspects, while relying on the usual jump cuts, loud sound scapes, creepy atmosphere and make up. In-Ho managed to come up with a strong storyline related to the hauntings experienced by the characters, and managed to keep audiences in suspense before all gets revealed in due course. Perhaps the end credits, which contained a sustained scene involving the primary ghoul, felt a little bit out of place for its slapstick nature. But if you can deal with minor inconsistencies involving who can see which ghoul, and are looking for a film that&apos;s apt as a date movie, then you may be bold enough to give this a go.",

Long ago, her father took off at holiday time, never to return. She insists that there be no decorations at the eatery and that the place will remain open on the Great Day. In addition, a newspaper food critic has ticked her off as well. So, she is in a bad mood when its quitting time. Ho, ho, things get worse when some punks try to mug her. But, happily, an old man, Sam (Muse Watkins) scares them off. Giving him a ride to the bus station, the two learn that Sam has missed his Greyhound. Not knowing what else to do, Kathleen invites him to stay with her, despite their recent friendship. Kathleen gets an additional guest when her boyfriend drops off his daughter, Lucy, in another emergency event. Having met once in the past, the two females don&apos;t really like or trust each other. But, stay together a bit they must. The last complication is a heavy snowfall, which prevents the three house mates from going anywhere the next day.....and the next. But, strangely, Sam begins to work more magic, helping Kathleen and Lucy start a friendship. Then, the weather improves and Sam comes up missing. Why has he gone without saying goodbye? This is truly a sweet Christmas film, with religious overtones, but rather somber. Nevertheless, its main theme of forgiveness is just what everyone needs. Stewart and Watkins are excellent, as is the young girl playing Lucy. Also pleasing are the sets, costumes, direction and heartfelt tale. For those who like to celebrate the holidays with a film, this is a nice choice.",

      "reviewBody": "The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away, yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon, but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact, and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon.\n\nThe movie stars Sam Rockwell as a lunar astronaut also named Sam stationed alone on the Moon for three years. He isn&apos;t entirely alone, because the AI computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is constantly following him. Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon, and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth. As Sam begins his last two weeks stationed in the mining facility, his mind begins to break down and he soon realizes he just might not be able to make it back.\n\nIt is quite obvious that the main intention of Moon was to pay respect to the older science fiction movies like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it is a great homage to the genre indeed. GERTY is possibly one of my favorite AI computers ever in a movie, because it constantly shows its mood through a series of different smiley faces, and has Kevin Spacey&apos;s voice. The overall story of Moon is pretty good, and it definitely tugs a bit on your emotions because the main character Sam is so real and relatable. It is a bit more of an art film, but I have found that the mixture of art and Sci-Fi is a brilliant combination.\n\nThe absolute key ingredient to making Moon was finding a capable actor because it is essentially a one man show, and they picked a winner with Sam Rockwell. Rockwell gives one of his best performances to date, and while it might be a little early to predict I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for his role. The other great thing about this picture is the special effects. Since the budget was so low this could have been a disaster, but the shots of the Moon Rovers and Harvesters were astonishingly realistic, and a typical movie goer would think this had at least a 40 million dollar budget. It is amazing how much more was accomplished with this tiny budget compared to the $200 million dollars poured into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.\n\nOverall Moon is a complete film. It isn&apos;t groundbreaking, but it accomplished everything it set out to be, which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. I found myself leaving the theater with a great feeling of satisfaction that I have only received from a couple movies this year so far.\n\n9/10",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s easy to tell that Reno 911: Miami is based on a TV series just by watching it. How can you tell? There&apos;s maybe 25 minutes or so of solid material, and an additional 60 worth of filler. In bringing the Comedy Central half hour &quot;reality&quot; cop show to the big screen, you get the sense that the filmmakers had a hard time trying to stretch the thing out. The show itself is often quite funny, and the movie works when it&apos;s remaining close in spirit to the TV series. But then they have to go and throw in a silly plot and a series of celebrity cameos that take us out of the movie.\n\nThe film takes the incompetent cops from the TV series out of Nevada and into Florida, where they have been invited to attend a police convention in Miami. (They only got invited because every police force got in.) They arrive for some fun in the sun, only to discover a bioterrorist act unfolding at the convention center itself, which has trapped every single police officer inside. Since the cops of Reno are the only available officers not inside the building when the situation kicks in, these eight dim-witted enforcers of the law must literally become the entire Miami Police Force, keeping peace in the city while trying to find out who is behind the chemical attack at the convention center. Other subplots include the Reno officers trying to deal with an evil Scarface-like drug lord (Paul Rudd) who keeps on threatening them, and discovering the truth behind a mysterious tattoo of a man&apos;s face that has appeared on the breast of one of the female officer&apos;s after a night of sex and binge drinking.\n\nWhen Reno 911: Miami is following the Cops-style reality show format, the movie can be a lot of good fun. The opening scenes where the eight individual officers are introduced, and the scenes where we get to see them on the job and dealing with situations such as a chicken that got loose made me smile and laugh quite a bit. The actors are at ease during these moments, and they&apos;re obviously having a lot of fun. Then the whole plot has to kick in, and the movie just doesn&apos;t seem as much fun as it did before. Reno 911 has never exactly been about plot, it&apos;s always been a series of mostly improvised skits skewering reality cop shows. While the movie does try to hold onto this format, giving us some various misadventures around Florida that have nothing to do with the biochemical plot, they don&apos;t seem as fresh or as funny as the Reno scenes early on. A lot of this has to do with the fact that a lot of the gags are either anti-climactic or have no real pay off. That&apos;s not to say that there are not some gags that work. A scene where the cops have to remove a beached whale from a topless beach had me laughing quite a bit, and the pay off involving an explosive device is one of the few that actually lives up to its set up and earns its laugh. More often than not, we either find ourselves smiling politely at the effort the actors are making, or simply staring at the screen with casual indifference to what we are seeing.\n\nThe movie seems to suffer from an identity crisis, as it doesn&apos;t know if it wants to be a series of skits and gross out gags, or if it wants to attempt to try to tell an actual story and parody action movies. It never finds a central tone or target for satire, and seems to change its mind every five minutes. This gives the film an annoyingly disjointed tone from which it never recovers. The celebrity cameos sprinkled throughout also don&apos;t work the way that they should, as they take us out of the movie. We&apos;re no longer watching a comic &quot;mockumentary&quot; making fun of cop shows, but we&apos;re watching a highly paid actor taking a cut on his paycheck for the sake of getting a quick laugh from the audience. I liked the scenes where the Reno cops took center stage, and were being their usual incompetent selves the best. It&apos;s fun watching these improvisational comics (many of whom have worked together for years on other TV shows) play off of each other and just be goofy. But Reno 911 wants to keep on reminding us that we&apos;re watching a movie, and the good stuff keeps on getting drowned out by uninspired gags or unnecessary plot.\n\nI certainly don&apos;t regret seeing Reno 911, and I think fans of the show probably won&apos;t either. However, the inconsistent tone and the uneven ratio of hit and miss gags don&apos;t leave a positive impression overall. Maybe this would have worked better as a regular half hour episode with all the filler, celebrity cameos and silly plot removed. The cast certainly seems more comfortable with a shorter amount of time to work in. That way, they don&apos;t have to compete with a bunch of stuff that shouldn&apos;t even be there in the first place.",

Neatly directed and scripted film from Jonathan Harr&apos;s factual book allows for both legal statistics and some dry legal humor, and avoids exploiting an emotionally-wrenching theme (the death of children) for hug-tugging sentiment. The film is direct and compact, pausing only occasionally for a dramatic character turn, and is handsomely-made if not terrifically entertaining. Travolta and nemesis lawyer Robert Duvall (smiling like the Cheshire Cat) are wonderful to watch sparring with one another, and the specifics of the case are intriguing. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Hustle&apos; is an overlooked film, though it is easy to see why.\n\nStylistically it is very low-key with no notable flourishes or tricksiness. It boasts little in the way of &apos;action&apos;. A hostage situation sequence seems to have been added purely to provide something in that line for fidgety Burt fans. It is profoundly cynical and resolutely (almost excessively) downbeat. But it is also very thoughtful, atmospheric, well acted and absorbing. A kind of modern dress companion piece to &apos;Chinatown&apos;. And whilst not quite achieving the force and subtlety of that film, it remains highly creditable.\n\nReynolds is effective as the world weary cop in love with a French prostitute, a cipher whom Deneuve turns into a real person. Her character represents some sort of unattainable, glamorous continental dream to the policeman. This idea is explored and reinforced by numerous references and allusions to European cinema, culture and locale.\n\nBurt looks uncannily like a youthful Brando and brings great restraint to a role which could have been horribly over-played. Ben Johnson, Eileen Brennan and Paul Winfield also all give good performances as beaten, screwed-up people. The outstanding turn, though, comes from Edward Albert as Leo Sellers, a wealthy and powerful businessman with dubious tastes and connections. This character is key to Steve Shagan&apos;s screenplay in the same way that John Huston&apos;s Noah Cross was to Robert Towne&apos;s &apos;Chinatown&apos;. A persona symbolic of corruption and degeneracy, but also integral to the prosperity of the society he is such a part of. Sellers is a refined, intelligent man with a keen eye for people&apos;s weak spots and fingers deft enough to push all of their buttons at once. Mr. Albert brings him to life with a palpable evil.\n\n&apos;Hustle&apos; is a film that I like to reacquaint myself with from time to time. Whilst Shagan&apos;s script is occasionally a tad overblown and too fruity for its own good, there are some great lines and moments. For me, it&apos;s noirish exploration of thwarted romanticism is pretty much irresistible.\n\nA minor classic."

The class of Costner&apos;s performance was exhibited no more finely than in the scenes where he was desperately searching for answers to his fears...his acting critics, who have in the past accused him of being &quot;wooden&quot; (&amp; much worse) should see this film &amp; re-evaluate their opinions of this fine actor.\n\nThe children were also good &amp; it was wonderful to see the great James Gammon in a quirky &amp; pivotal supporting role.\n\nUsually in this kind of film, the &quot;bad guy&quot; (for want of a better term) tends to end up some lame, crappy alien or a figment of the characters imagination &amp; the ending lets down a strong set up &amp; middle section. In &quot;The New daughter&quot; however, the screenplay is strong &amp; quality right up to the very final few seconds which had me sitting back in my chair saying out loud...&quot;NO WAY!&quot;\n\nI think Costner fans will rejoice at seeing this timeless American performer once again showing us the kind of less is better charisma the likes of which we haven&apos;t seen since the halcyon days of Steve McQueen &amp; Paul Newman &amp; the Costner detractors should swallow their pride &amp; give him a chance...he may just surprise you.\n\n7 out of 10.",

As great as that film is, I personally prefer &apos;Hwanyo&apos; or &apos;Woman of Fire&apos;. Here, the oversaturated colours - blues and reds in particular - and the superb cinematography deepen the exploration of the characters. Also, the new housemaid is here a victim of male violence, rather than the highly eroticised agent of chaos of the original film. Those who admired Youn Yuh-jung&apos;s Oscar-winning performance in &apos;Minari&apos; will enjoy seeing her in &apos;Woman of Fire&apos; as sweet and innocent young woman driven mad by trauma, shame and desire.\n\nKim Ki-young works in a similar register as Oshima Nagisa, the great Japanese modernist, yet his films are even more committed to melodrama. He explores connections between late capitalism, modernism and sexual and erotic tension.\n\n&apos;Woman of Fire&apos; is a sadly unwatched classic of Korean cinema. Clearly not for everyone, it would perhaps appeal more to fans of Fassbinder, Pasolini, and Imamura.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard for me to tell whether this film is good or not. I didn&apos;t like it. To say it more accurately: I really suffered this one and a half hours in my cushioned seat. First, and this one is easy: It is the worst austrian movie of the past ten years I&apos;ve seen. Haders performance is far behind his possibilities, and Dueringer... well, I don&apos;t like him. He&apos;s not acting, he&apos;s playing himself. I liked &apos;Hinterholz 8&apos;, but I can&apos;t see anymore of his performances, because it&apos;s always the same person, without any changes - there&apos;s no acting. The worst part of this &apos;experience&apos; was, that everyone in the theather was expecting comedy. And it surely wasn&apos;t. There have been a few good jokes, the rest was death-scaring serious. But many guys sitting next to me didn&apos;t get this, and they laughed the whole way through. I think it&apos;s the advertisments fault, which made us believe that this is a funny movie. Who knows, with a more serious, more quiet auditorium I might&apos;ve been able to enjoy this film. But that&apos;s not the only point. &apos;Der Ueberfall&apos; has boring scenes with absolute no message (I think so, &apos;cause I didn&apos;t find any), and more than once I thought about leaving the theather before gettin&apos; real angry &apos;bout myself, because that was such a waste of time. To say it again, maybe I would have liked it more with no idiots laughing loudly during scenes, in which d√ºringer beats his hostages or gets punched bloody just minutes later. It was the &apos;Three Kings&apos; effect: There everybody expected comedy and saw a hard, rude war movie - stuff to think about. But there the audience checked this, and after about thirty minutes of &apos;reorganization&apos; I was able to see &apos;Three Kings&apos; in the right manner. At &apos;der Ueberfall&apos; this was impossible. Maybe I will see him once more - alone and in front of my tube, and maybe I&apos;m gonna repeal my opinion then. For now: Don&apos;t waste your money, go and see &apos;Indien&apos;, &apos;Wanted&apos; or even &apos;Hinterholz 8&apos; on video, if you want to see good austrian stuff. Because those are good, &apos;der Ueberfall&apos; isn&apos;t.",

The movie still will have the audiences attention for the most part. The story is basically about a priest that loses his faith in God after his daughter gets kidnapped. Yes, like I said the direction isn&apos;t anything really new, but it&apos;s still gripping with enough emotion to feel something for the victims. It has certain elements which will make the audience root for the father to find his daughter. This is a very serious movie and although it&apos;s been done before there is still enough tension to keep focus most of the way through. When a parent loses their child in most cases it will drive them crazy, especially if they never find the body alive or dead. And you can sort of feel that emotion in this movie a bit, even if your not a parent. But one thing that got to me was the use of the police in this, let&apos;s just say the timing is terrible to the point it&apos;s not all that believable sometimes. But still this movie&apos;s main flaw is how generic it is, even the chase scenes feels so much like it&apos;s a deja vu and has been done better in other films.\n\n6.2/10",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been regarded as the cream of Hong Kong gangster and cop movie. And has won 22 awards. But we all know awards don&apos;t mean a thing sometimes. The God Father of America cinema &quot;Martin Scorsese&quot; himself is making a American version of the movie, titled: Departed. I&apos;m somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master, but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.\n\nA little history of Hong Kong film industry, being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years, Hong Kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria. On one hand, everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. On the other hand, lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and mature.\n\nNow back to the movie itself. 3 years ago, when I was still a poor student, I was loitering in the local Chinese video store as usual, looking for something exciting. The owner handed me a VHS copy of this movie, he personally recommended it and said it&apos;s new and unique. So I went home and watched it immediately. And then I said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes, in utter silence.\n\nThere was no plot twist, and no surprise ending, no Mr. M Night&apos;s heavy handed gimmicks and Hollywood&apos;s camera tricks. But from the beginning to the end, for full 2 hours, you can cut the tension with a knife. In the end, you still don&apos;t want it to end. The story goes on in your mind, questions, bits and pieces start to put together, characters start to take shape even after the movie ended.\n\nIn my entire life, I&apos;ve never seen a movie that there isn&apos;t a single excessive frame, until I saw this movie. It has forever changed my expectation on crime drama.\n\nThe story is genius and simple enough. A mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia. They don&apos;t know each other&apos;s identity, so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each other&apos;s wits. I won&apos;t reveal too much of it even though like I said, there&apos;s no plot twist.\n\nIt&apos;s a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out, and since been talked, compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards.\n\nIf you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie, try this one.",

Back then, it was the first film that showed the cop and villain chase with equal detailing presented from both aspects: the planning of the crime as well as the investigation. That&apos;s what made the film gripping and entertaining throughout. The dialogues and cinematography were also really good. The soundtrack too stood out. Overall, it&apos;s one of those rare movies which had everything in proper place. Urvashi&apos;s character, however, could have been made less passive and submissive and instead given more depth and strength. She&apos;s an excellent actress who can do any role. Mammooty was fantastic as the cop. The villain, played by Captain Raju, was portrayed with the right amount of evilness and mystery.",

      "reviewBody": "Murnau&apos;s SUNRISE ranks as one my ten favorite films -- it may be number one! It has been exciting to see SUNRISE and other of his films make it to DVD, many in beautifully restored prints. It is also exciting to discover some of his earlier works and see the genius of this master filmmaker developing. That is certainly the case with his 1922 BURNING SOIL. Like a reviewer elsewhere on this site I felt that I was watching a work done by Ingmar Bergman. The story may be viewed as somewhat melodramatic but the directing, acting and cinematography are for the most part quite stunning. It is frustrating to read about a film that you would like to see and not find it available to see, so I am pleased to let anyone interested in seeing this early Murnau work know that Grapevine Video of Phoenix, Arizona has released it. The picture quality is quite sharp and the tones quite nice though the print has a lot of specks. However, coming from the only known print to exist, I was more then pleased with the print. The orchestra score provided by Lou McMahon does not fit the mood some of the time, but for the most part it adds to the watching of the film. If you are interested in obtaining this title then get check it out on www.grapevinevideo.com . Grapevine Video offers a number of silent titles that can not be found anywhere else.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shinobi&quot; presents us with an epic tale of love, hate, political manipulation and the plight of the underdog against an overwhelming foe, be it a tangible foe or fate itself. The coolest part about this movie is the background and super power of each character, each one being original, fascinating and deeply layered as we learn in bits and pieces. The worst part about this movie is that it falls back on a few clich√©s that may annoy you in this otherwise unusual spin on the classic &quot;love in the time of hate&quot; story.\n\nFirst the cool stuff. The plot centers around a fight to the death between 2 teams with 5 warriors on each team. Here&apos;s the thing: each warrior has a unique power which isn&apos;t spelled out for us. We need to piece it together what their power is and how they got it. These aren&apos;t just a bunch of sword swingers running through the forest; they each have a very specialized skill that they stick to (often not even involving weaponry).\n\nFor example, one character is a woman who was raised on poison, and so she has literally the kiss of death. But it goes deeper than that. Having the kiss of death means that she can never know true love because all her lovers would die, and so she leads a tragic life, existing only for the sake of killing though she years to know what love is. How cool is that!\n\nOther characters possess similarly complex powers which lead to deep conflicts in life, and you realize that even the most ruthless ones have an unspoken human side.\n\nThe main story focuses on two lovers who, you guessed it, end up on opposite teams. Here is where the Shakespearean question of fate plays heavily. One of them believes that they can somehow beat their tragic fate while the other is resigned to a hopeless ending. What I loved about this movie (at first) is that it doesn&apos;t waste time with waffling sensibility: right off the bat, the lovers refuse to fight and they make their peaceful intentions known. But slowly they start getting dragged into the inevitable violence.\n\nBut unfortunately the film later falls back on a few clich√©s which we&apos;ve seen dozens of times before in other tales of love and war, and that&apos;s where I dock Shinobi a few points. With its original setup, I was hoping it was going to stay in that vein and avoid what so many other films have done. It does stay unique, but one or two critical plot elements were pure cookie cutter. Making matters worse, these plot elements were not in line with the characters&apos; personalities. It&apos;s like the clich√©s were thrown in just because the film had to have them.\n\nIt&apos;s not a fatal flaw, and you may not even notice unless like me you&apos;ve watched dozens of epic love/war stories like this. Who knows, maybe the whole thing will be fresh and new for you. But I just wanted to temper your expectations a bit. Although Shinobi is a good movie, it&apos;s not quite awesome. Still worth your time, though.\n\nMovies in this genre which I *do* consider awesome are the Yimou Zhang films &quot;Hero&quot; (2002) and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004). While &quot;Shinobi&quot; is a great effort, I think you should check out those others first to get a taste of cinematic perfection.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting mix of family drama, crime thriller and kung fu as Jet Li plays a mainland Chinese cop going undercover to infiltrate a robbery gang in Hong Kong. His young son has been told his dad is a wanted criminal, but the son continues to have faith in him. When Jet&apos;s wife dies, a female HK cop (played by Anita Mui) enters the mix and brings the son to Hong Kong. While the plot is fairly engaging, it sometimes slows down the action, which is not as extensive here as it is in so many of Jet Li&apos;s Hong Kong films. However, the boy (played by Tze Miu) is a kung fu champ himself and contributes some clever fight scenes including a confrontation with taunting classmates. There&apos;s one mind-boggling action scene involving a garbage dump and a garbage truck, which finds Anita scurrying up a tall iron gate, shooting the truck driver as the truck barrels towards her, leaping from the top of the gate through the smashed windshield and into the passenger&apos;s seat, and commandeering the truck, all without a scratch. The big action finale takes place on a large yacht where an auction of illegal Chinese treasures is underway and Jet takes on all three bad guys, played by the formidable trio of Yu Rong Guang (IRON MONKEY), Ngai Sing (THE BODYGUARD FROM BEIJING, KUNG FU CULT MASTER), and Ken Lo (DRUNKEN MASTER II). Here Jet uses his son in a most ingenious (and impossible) manner to defeat the bad guys."

Casey Pugh had an idea and that idea was the harness the power the internet and social networking to remake the classic film. The &quot;New Hope&quot; film was cut up into 15 minute segments and fans could select which ones they wanted to remake, the fan-made clips were than voted on and put in the final movie. The final result is a mishmash of different talents from all over the world. We are treated to a mishmash of cut- out animation, flash animation, live-action, featuring an assortment of different actors, family members, toys, cats and puppets playing the various roles. We see homages to various other films including Yellow Submarine, Monty Python, and many others. All and all, it is an interesting experiment in film making for the internet ago.",

Maybe that&apos;s because of my own relationship to my father, which is not bad but I wonder if he&apos;s so different from the father in the film. The four actors are great and so absolutely convincing that I can&apos;t imagine they played anything but themselves. The characters are smart and their arrangement discloses some interesting correlations. It made me think about my own &apos;inner odds&apos; and the question, where they come from and if there&apos;s a way to overcome. I can&apos;t remember a film that was going so deep, I even think it raises some of the most important questions of our soul or psyche ‚Äì which are normally dealt with very superficially. I hope very much this film will influence and inspire many film makers to make some more films of such intimate power.",

      "reviewBody": "A middle-aged artist (Ben Gazarra) sketching on the beach witnesses a young woman (Ornella Muti) being rescued from drowning. He loans her a blanket. Later she returns the blanket and they have sex several times, but she always leaves right afterward, leaving the man to wonder who she is and where she goes. Things become more complicated as he begins to fall in love with her, and after his regular girlfriend (Mimsy Farmer), with whom he has a curiously open relationship, returns. He eventually begins to realize his mysterious new lover may be very much insane.\n\nMuti is excellent in this movie, but it&apos;s unfortunate that she really has to struggle here against her own incredible beauty. You really have to suspend your disbelief that you are NOT watching someone who is quite literally one of the most beautiful women in the world in scenes where she has to fake drownings or sit in an outdoor caf√© in a mini-skirt with her legs splayed to get attention from men. (With the average attractive woman this would be believable, but with someone that looks like Muti you would expect a riot, a traffic pile-up, or a line of guys waiting to administer mouth-to-mouth). Her affair with an old codger like Gazarra also strains credibility (the pair were also teamed, even more implausibly, in Marco Ferreti&apos;s biopic of poet Charles Bukowski &quot;Tales of Ordinary Madness&quot;). Still Muti turns in a truly superb performance. Gazarra is also more than adequate. Farmer is as irritating as usual, but at least here she&apos;s meant to be here.\n\nThis was apparently based on a novel by the talented Italian director Pasquale Campanile Festa, who also directed &quot;The Libertine&quot;, &quot;Hitch-hike&quot; and &quot;Body of a Woman&quot; (and who definitely knew his way around the bodies of some beautiful women like Catherine Spaak, Corrine Clery, Lili Karati, and, of course Muti). Unfortunately, the import DVD I saw was obviously ported from a poor video source and is kind of grainy and too dark at times (most regrettably during some of Mutti&apos;s nude scenes). This is a very decent movie and really deserves a better transfer. Still it&apos;s a must-see for any Italian movie fans, teaming up one of Italy&apos;s most incredible (and incredibly beautiful) actresses, and one of Italy&apos;s most talented (if underrated when compared to more famous contemporaries like Fellini, Antonioni, or Pasolini) directors. Definitely recommended."

      "reviewBody": "STAGEFRIGHT aka AQUARIUS is a very stylish chiller from Michele Soavi, whose critical reputation rests on this film and the later CEMETERY MAN.\n\n Certainly the film is derivative, and fans of this subgenre will surely comment that they have seen it all before; however, Soavi, like his mentor Dario Argento, is astute when he chooses the likes of ENNIO MORRICONE; GOBLIN, and now SIMON BOSWELL to score his films.\n\nBoswell&apos;s compositions together with the opening and end titles written by Stefano Mainetti propel the film along, and provide an aural edge to the onscreen visuals.  And if their contributions were not enough, the inspired, and uncredited use of Dmitri Shostakovich&apos;s 8th symphony, 3rd movement (&quot;allegro non troppo&quot;), reflects the imaginative touches that distinguish this film from many others.\n\nThe play/film within a film works quite well, especially as the cinema is acknowledged to be the art of illusion; indeed this conceit looks ahead to the two DEMONS films, set in a cinema, where the audience are overwhelmed with illusion become reality.\n\nThe acting is more than sufficient as the characters are written as types, and set up as victims, just as the heroine has a personality that sets her apart.  Her final scenes with the killer are very effective indeed; her fearfulness make her vulnerable, her vulnerability draws us to her, and in drawing us to her, we submit to the relentless onslaught the killer pursues.\n\nThis is a film where the viewer/audience surely knows the outcome, but the satisfaction comes from the execution - literally - of the route that the filmmaker takes.\n\nI now have this film on a budget UK DVD which reveals little - I am playing it back on a 16:9 TV, and am very pleased with the quality of the sound (mono) and the visuals, plus some of the unusual, though rare basic extras."

      "reviewBody": "There are a couple of ways of looking at Eichmann&apos;s capture, conviction, and execution -- and they lead to different conclusions.\n\nMorally, of course, the guy was responsible for the brutalization and deaths of more than six million innocent people. &quot;More&quot; than six million because nobody really knows how many, and the homosexuals, mentally retarded, political undesirables, gypsies, and the rest are often forgotten. It was morally right for Eichmann to be hanged.\n\nPsychologically, I&apos;m not so sure. We all need enemies. They serve as bad examples for the rest of us. They hold us together. When they&apos;ve escaped justice, they animate our existence. We can see the dynamic at work today in America. The air is full of hatred. With the execution of Eichmann, part of our reason for being disappeared. It&apos;s like achieving any other grand goal to which you&apos;ve dedicated years. What follows the initial celebration is an emotional let down. I wonder how many of us slumped when we learned that Josef Mengele was confirmed to have been long dead, deep down, underneath the gratitude paid to Fortune.\n\nSociologically, the results are mixed. Religious offenses are carried across generations. Anyone of Jewish background is less likely to forgive and forget. Not a family went unscathed. Germany will always be the villain for all of us, although every German who participated in any way in the Nazi genocidal program is now dead. The Shi&apos;ites and Sunni have been at each others&apos; throats, on and off, for more than a thousand years.\n\nThe film is told mostly from Eichmann&apos;s point of view when he was a captive being interrogated. A fine performance from Thomas Kretschmann, whether as the young SS officer or the self-justifying prisoner. And from Franke Potente as the interrogator&apos;s wife, Vera, although she&apos;s dubbed. Troy Garity, as Avner Less, the interrogator, is particularly weak. There are times when it seems that he&apos;s never acted before.\n\nThe flashbacks begin when Eichmann is already a colonel in the SS, and he&apos;s a heartless and treacherous bastard. He may love his children -- it sounds like it -- but he&apos;s an adulterer and manipulator. In Budapest, he takes up with a succulent baroness, Tereza Srbov√°, with whom, under other circumstances, any normally depraved man would willingly take up.\n\nSome of it is literally hard to believe. The baroness gets Eichmann all hot and glandular by having him recite the number of Jews he&apos;s killed from different countries while sitting naked on his lap. Later, she brings him a cheerful baby in a basket, tells Eichmann that the baby&apos;s blood is tainted, and orders him to kill the baby on the spot. And don&apos;t worry. The flesh will be fed to the dogs and the tiny bones ground up for fertilizer. &quot;I&apos;ve always heard the cabbages from Budapest are the best.&quot; Eichmann hesitates, then shoots the babe with his pistol. Murdering the toddler, yes. He murdered a million toddlers. But shooting it in its cradle in front of his anti-Semitic girl friend? It&apos;s easier to believe that the Chief Interrogator drove a Volkswagon in 1963 Jerusalem, which he does.\n\nAt least we&apos;re spared the horrors of the concentration camp films, and Eichmann isn&apos;t presented as a slavering monster. The narrative is really a duel between the solemn Jewish interrogator and the suave Eichmann. Most flashbacks are brief. We listen to a list of Eichmann&apos;s many sins and watch him smoothly deny them. &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; captures the younger Eichmann as little more than a secretary when the Nazis were trying to unravel the numerous knots of the &quot;final solution.&quot; It&apos;s a more informative film than this because it tells us things we didn&apos;t already know.\n\nOr DO we know about Eichmann and the Nazi genocide? A survey of 1,000 secondary school pupils aged 11-16 revealed that 15% were not sure what Auschwitz was. 10% thought the infamous Nazi camp was a country bordering Germany and 2% thought it was a brand of beer. A further 2% identified Auschwitz as a religious festival, while a worrying 1% believed it was a type of bread. The poll also found that 60% did not know what the Final Solution was, with a 20% thinking it was the name given to the peace talks which ended the Second World War. (sky.com)",

This Rodrigo is so nasty that he even has Rosita&apos;s cute little half-sister kidnapped, but the brave muscle man Samson will take care of it...\n\nSo nothing new from the sword and sandal film! Rather a weak work from the almost inexhaustible series of the Italian Peplum era!",

The dialogue is witty, the characters charming, and the developing romance a joy to watch.  The second half is a drama which is deep and engaging.  The dignity with which the characters act through trying circumstances is wonderful, and a marked contrast and relief to the hysterical characters found in contemporary movies.  To have two such different moods both handled with such extreme skill in the same movie makes this a rare gem.\n\nThe acting is superb; both Dunne and Boyer play with believable subtlety and emotional power.  They drew me in so I cared enormously.  Maria Ouspenskaya is, as always, superb.  Compare her performance here with her blistering performance in her similar-but-opposite role in Dodsworth.  The direction is very straightforward in its service to the story, with only the occasional standout moments:  look for the superb shots of the couple&apos;s first kiss, of the reflected empire state building, and of the double headline.  With a story and acting as strong as this, that&apos;s exactly as it should be.",

      "reviewBody": "There was a time not very long ago, when movies from Hong Kong meant one thing : &quot;ACTION&quot; sometimes an overdose of it. But regardless of the naysayers, they were quiet brilliant at it. But then they grew either too frivolous or too serious and sometimes too pretentious for their own good. Dante Lam (one of the better ones out there) in the face of this gradual change has earned himself a name for sticking to his &quot;guns&quot;; literally. &amp; if the experience of his latest offer is anything to go by, the trend may just catch up again. I for one will not be complaining.\n\nThe GOOD : This potentially could be the most accomplished HK &quot;action&quot; movie in a contemporary sense of the word and setting. There have been a few masterclasses but most of them are either from the age of the Kings &amp; Queens or of characters with super powers (yawn inducing). &quot;The Viral Factor&quot; does not have any gravity defying stunts nor does it have a single shot which is used to glamorise the protagonist or the antagonist. With all due respect to Donnie Yen, considered the best action man in town and my favourite too, there have been too many caricatured villains in his movies. Nothing like that in TVF. Its bare knuckles, blood splattered walls, rusty nails / water pipes, plenty of body bags, big guns in extended street chase sequences, car crashes, rocket launchers, helicopter chases and the list goes on. You absolutely have to give it to the director for his no holds barred approach from start to finish. He does not pretend its anything else. The leads Jay Chou &amp; Nicholas Tse, have done a fantastic job and quite possibly have produced their best work yet. Chinese lads are not known for histrionics but some demanding &amp; long single shots have brought out the best in them. Nicholas Tse in my book has grown to be in a different league compared to his &quot;Dragon Tiger Gate&quot; days and character.The story although not a pathbreaker has a sense of nobility in it with a platform for a large spectrum of emotions. The almost unseen city skyline that of KL (in a movie before this) is used as a backdrop and that adds on the rare but tingling after taste that the movie leaves. I was very curious to see how it&apos;d turn up and its fair to say I am mighty impressed as I have lived right in the middle of almost all the places the story evolves through. The BAD : The screenplay does not do any huge favours to the story and is the biggest let down of the movie. It stands as the biggest deterrent to what it could have been. Mostly because, the 2nd n 3rd acts which is the glue that holds the end to the start tends to give a convoluted feel. There is nothing wrong in the story, but the sequence of events and there by its impact could have been spot on with some crisp writing. The editing leaves a little to be desired coz if that was snappy, TVF could have been an immortal piece of ACTION cinema. All these also mean that the runtime could do with some some chopping. Another sore point of the proceedings esp. for the non English speaking crowd, is the amount of English used in the script. Some of them were necessary and fits well. But I could not digest the main baddie delivering almost all his lines and most importantly the ones that mattered to the eventual development of the story, in English. And if it counts at all, I don&apos;t speak Cantonese or Mandarin nor understand 1 bit. Considering this is predominantly aimed at the Chinese with a more than liberal approach begging the westerners to pay a visit, the subtitles alone would have sufficed.\n\nThe FINAL WORD : Its recommended for the action fan. Go and have Yourself a great time at the theater. One of the best ways to kick off a new year.\n\nRead more reviews http://mayurdeep.com",

      "reviewBody": "Rain Fall, like the meteorological event of its namesake, came and went with little fanfare when it was released. Based on one novel in a series by Barry Eisler, it follows John Rain (Kippei Shina), a Japanese assassin for hire who becomes deeply embroiled in a hunt for a mysterious flash drive, the contents of which could have nasty consequences if released. Between the Yakuza, Japanese government and the CIA, Rain has his plate full, especially when he has to take a young girl under his wing who is in danger from all factions involved. Gary Oldman makes twitchy work playing William Holtzer, the unsavoury and corrupt Token CIA station chief. He barks orders like he&apos;s in a Bourne film, bends rules and is a morally blank, ruthless A-hole. Oldman plays him without his usual villainous and eccentric flair, opting for a stressed out, nervy turn which suits the gloomy tone of the film. It is a drab yet exciting affair, the intrigue dimmed down to dull greys and muted gunfights that ebb and flow with a minimal pulse. Shina is awesome as Rain, and seems born to play the spy thriller protagonist. Under the radar is how this one plays it, an atmospheric cloak and dagger outing well worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "The Farrelly brothers have had a successful history, but their best work was past them a long time ago. Dumb and Dumber and There&apos;s Something About Mary are among the two funniest comedies of all-time, and put the brothers at the peak of stardom. However, their track record afterwards is a heavily mixed bag; you find your underrated gems (Osmosis Jones, Fever Pitch) and then your disasters (Shallow Hal, Stuck on You). The Heartbreak Kid is their attempt to reach back into grade-A stardom like back in the late 90s. Joining with old friend Ben Stiller, they attempt to successfully recreate an old Neil Simon story about a man who has second thoughts about his marriage during his honeymoon. What we get is a cruel, twisted, vulgar, outrageous, and bittersweet movie that tramples over morality and messes around with the typical romantic comedy formula. Unfortunately though, the cruelty in this movie prevents it from being anywhere near romantic. While the Farrelly brothers crafted their best work since Osmosis Jones, this is still nowhere near as good as their comedies of the previous decade.\n\nHeartbreak Kid is about Eddie (Ben Stiller), a lonely man who meets a woman (Lila, played by Malin Akerman) during a random encounter, and after a few weeks believes that she is the perfect woman for him. However, right after the wedding, another side of his perfect woman is revealed, and is slowly but surely becoming a nightmare come true. Despite their honeymoon being in a beautiful portion of Mexico, the honeymoon is a disaster as Eddie struggles to survive being with his new wife. Worst of all, during the honeymoon he meets another woman, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), who seems to be absolutely perfect for him. In this cruel script, nobody is the hero, and seemingly everybody is the victim in some way or another. Nobody is safe in the movie; which makes this story perfect for the Farrelly Brothers.\n\nBen Stiller seems to play the same kind of role multiple times, as he has a similar presence to that of his character in There&apos;s Something About Mary and Along Came Polly. The only difference is, he&apos;s a bit more sinister and a much bigger jerk. His new wife is portrayed perfectly by Malin Akerman, who isn&apos;t afraid of embarrassing herself or showing off her body. Their physical humor together creates the biggest laughs in the movie. The most desirable character by far comes from the best performance; Michelle Monaghan of Mission Impossible fame delivers this charming, sweet performance as the adorable and beautiful Miranda. Everyone else did a decent job, with Jerry Stiller in a throwaway role as Eddie&apos;s father and Carlos Mencia (surprisingly funny) as a manager of the hotel in Mexico.\n\nThis movie&apos;s biggest flaw is its obvious attempts to re-create the surprise vulgarity and bittersweet content of There&apos;s Something About Mary. It worked back then, but it has trouble now, simply because the characters are not as likable, and the movie lacks heart. In Dumb and Dumber, you knew that they weren&apos;t meant to get that dream girl, but their persistence and their kindness (hidden underneath their stupidity) allows for the audience to root for them regardless. In There&apos;s Something About Mary, the main character goes to great lengths to find Mary and attempt to be with her; it became a raunchy and bizarre hero&apos;s journey. In this movie, the main character selfishly marries, and tramples over other people (emotionally mind you) in order to find his actual soulmate; making him not a necessarily likable character.\n\nIn spite of the lack of heart, you will find the laughs, no denying that. The new wife from hell routine was spoiled far too much in the previews, yet was still enjoyable. Unfortunately, once again, misdirection keeps Heartbreak Kid from being funnier than it could have been. After a while, Lila practically disappears from the movie, focusing more on Eddie&apos;s budding romance with Miranda. The movie mellows down once Lila is out of the way, and then we see a train wreck waiting to happen for about half an hour. If you are a fan of There&apos;s Something About Mary, there will be plenty to laugh about, but none of the content is rich or deep; most of the funniest scenes happens to be gross-out and shock humor. One unique thing in Heartbreak Kid is pretty crappy special effects, which makes it worse for this kind of movie because these kinds of movies do not use much special effects, if any at all. Soundtrack also isn&apos;t as catchy or as fun as other Farrelly Brothers movies, especially Dumb and Dumber.\n\nBottom Line: Heartbreak Kid is funny, but its not an instant classic, nor is it a type of movie to take a date to. While it is not as painfully disastrous as Good Luck Chuck, it still pales in comparison to recent adult comedies and early Farrelly efforts. Ben Stiller still provides the laughs through his physical humor and his ability to perfectly portray a man mentally breaking down. However, this movie has major morality issues and then really slows down once the romance builds up, yet we aren&apos;t rooting for anybody because everyone is guilty of lying, deceiving, and worse (except for one character). The directors are somewhat on the right track back to their glory days, but still have a longs way to go. They also really need to grow up and try to fray away from the gross humor, something that Mike Myers suffers from. Looking for laughs? Look no further. Looking for an amazing film? Keep looking.",

Its an ultra &quot;Z&quot; film only for one propose, too shock, with ultra violent and grotesque scenes, with a non linear\\sense story.The film focus the character Karl the Buchter (Andreas Schnaas, also the director) in a killing spree, walking around the woods killing people without a propose, every signle death is sadistic and brutal..(what they are thinking?)!\n\nIts not a film of all gore fans, its beyond that,its a film for real ultra-violent cinema fans, in my opinion the film is a little bit sick,nasty and unnecessary..If you like this one, i recommend: &quot;Antro da Necrofilia&quot; and &quot;Eu Zombie!!! 2- A carnificina total&quot;",

The over-dubbing was quite good, as was the camera work, set, and - especially considering the number of child actors - the acting.\n\nI was right on the verge of a 7 out of 10, but the story - while cute - is a little weak. I remember watching an odd horror film at a festival years ago, and the highlight was that the extras were vaudeville performers, and that was the highlight of the movie for me. For this, it would have been cool to see some actual circus performers and then just mask up the actors - that sort of thing.\n\nStill, worth the watch for a family film or perhaps to support these sort of indie projects.",

He manages to save the unborn dog by messing with its genes, and decides that if he can do it with dogs, he can do it with humans. He steals a foetus from the local hospital, and uses it to create a female child. Amazingly, the child grows an incredible rate, and is a near-genius, very beautiful woman within a couple of months. Then, Franken-daddy makes his big mistake... he falls in love with his own creation, and gets her pregnant!\n\nThe modern elements of The Bride of Frankenstein sit nicely in this disturbing update. Hudson is OK as the scientist, and Carrera as the female he builds is pretty believable. Roddy McDowall has a funny guest appearance as a chess whiz who gets thrashed at his favourite game by the super-intelligent Carrera.\n\nWhat I dislike about this movie is that as it goes on, it starts to go for cheap shocks and unpersuasive horror touches, rather than maintaining the accent on the science fiction side of the story. It veers off track and ends up like any old exploitation horror flick of the 60s and 70s. If they could have just stuck by the science fiction, then this would have been a top class film. As it is, it&apos;s no better than average. Pity, really!"

      "reviewBody": "Originally made as a silent film, Odna was released in 1931 as a &apos;sound&apos; film ¬ñ which differs from a talkie because although there are sound effects in the film, there is no synchronised dialogue and it was intended to be performed with an orchestral accompaniment using a score by Shostakovich. After it fell into political disfavour the film was archived in the Lenfilm complex, which was destroyed during the siege of Leningrad. Fortunately, although much of the score was lost, all but one 8-minute reel survived, as did the full score for the missing reel. Mark Fitz-Gerald and colleagues, with the encouragement of Shostakovich&apos;s widow, completed the restoration of the original score in 2003. It was first performed in the Netherlands and has also been performed in France, Switzerland and Germany. I attended the London Premiere on 10th February 2006.\n\nNormally, a review relates to an experience that can be shared subsequently by any cinema-goer, or watcher of DVDs. A live concert performance (the BBC Symphony Orchesttra conducted by Mark Fitz-Gerald) is different. The entire orchestral performance and live sound effects such as the throat singer, Theramin and Harmonium will not be constant factors - which is why performances of great musical works are reviewed repeatedly. The performance I experienced may be different from what you experience. For me, what might have been a rather sentimental ending was transformed by the &apos;buzz&apos; of the live musical climax (the entire restored score was performed, with titles explaining the action of the missing reel).\n\nA notable feature of the film was the superb natural performance of the &apos;actors&apos; (including a real shaman performing a real ritual) with none of the exaggerated eye makeup of &apos;Napoleon&apos; and the German expressionists. Such a live performance converted a good propaganda film into something more sublime and an experience that should not be missed if the opportunity is repeated.",

      "reviewBody": "A well intentioned danish love drama, with a story that has been seen before, or something similiar to it at least, but the movie feels rather unexperienced all the way through.\n\nBo, Mikkel og Jakob are 3 really good friends in a small town in Denmark, they all go to the same class in school and after school they play at the same soccer team, and hangs out talking about girls and lifes other mysteries, Jakob is very fascinated by a girl in class, but as she moves away faith teams him up with her former partner in school, Mathilde for a history project, And Jakob&apos;s love story can begin, his and his partners unexperience is obvious though and he finds himself drifting away from his best friends.\n\n The unexperienced crew behind and infront of the camera in this movie shines through a lot, sadly i think, because the movie got many good intentions and it&apos;s a good attempt to create a solid love thriller with a byte, but somewhere in all the unexperience it fails, mostly i think it&apos;s moving too fast, too many details are skipped and that way seems unrealistic, for an example it&apos;s like Jakob and Mathilde are in love with each other even before they get to know each other, so basically Jakob moves from not wanting to have anything to do with her, to want to have love with her, a bit drastic and unrealistic i think, however it does feel like he doesn&apos;t know which leg to stand on. Which is often the case for this age group, i know it, i myself in that age group.\n\nAs a result of this, plus the obvious unexperienced actors, it is hard to get personal with the characters, which means that it doesn&apos;t get to your heart, again as a result of this you don&apos;t feel the sorrow and sadness as the movie wants you to feel, as everything starts falling apart for the characters. Also i think that the movie is trying to go over to much, from a simple love story, it tries to create a world of too many mysteries and betrayes, for example the scene with Mikkel and Mathilde at her work, how does this go unforgotten, there isn&apos;t really ever an explanation to this awkward scene, it&apos;s like it was squeezed in, i don&apos;t know how many scenes were recorded, but i can&apos;t help to think that it feels like the director have cut a lot of main ones, and included some who weren&apos;t as important, at least not from my point of view.\n\nThe directing of the movie feels very unexperienced as i just passed through, i think there are some good points, but the editing part of it must have been hard, becuase it often feels like something has been left out or skipped past, or maybe it&apos;s the script, what do i know, but i think it shines through that the director is not very experienced.\n\nFor the acting of this movie it was yet again very unexperienced, and even though the girls are cute and the boys ok, they look like danish people, i do liked Mathilde though, she was pretty nice, but something that goes for all of them is that their acting just doesn&apos;t feel very engaging, it feels a bit hollow, which causes for the movie not really get reach inside you, which i think is important, especially for a story like this. The love scenes are pretty well done for an unexperienced crew like this, and i&apos;m sure the two main actors as Jakob and Mathilde were rather nervous doing it, but that&apos;s what turned out best.\n\nI&apos;m giving my vote on this movie based on what i think is good intentions, the movie has high ambitions, it&apos;s obvious that it wants to be proffesional and sophisticated, but it just doesn&apos;t succeed in all those things, so i give my vote basically becuase i think the movie is still a good attempt, even though it eventually tries to get it&apos;s hands around too many things, which makes it feel a bit uncompleted, but the story is there, perhaps more experience to crew would have made for a better movie, i still enjoyed it though, but maybe because it&apos;s something i can easily relate too.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "this is a great movie from Mani Ratnam.. it depicted the love hate relationship between the two brothers who were born to different mothers superbly. Mani Ratnam is one of the finest film makers in Indian cinema. he has the potential of making the best films in history of world cinema!! The songs of the movie are just classics with the Raja Rajathi Raja song the best!!! Some of the other songs too rock.. Ilayaraja has showcased his talents in this movie in a big way. This movie also lead to many movies coming in the same genre, notable one being the Vijay-Surya movie &quot;Naerukku Naer&quot;. My favorite scene of the movie is the one where Karthik&apos;s sister gets teased by some goons in the train and she moves to the other compartment where her step brother Prabhu is with his lover Amala and this girl calls Prabhu &apos;Anna&apos; (brother) and asks him to save her from the goons!",

The sound mixing was horrible. There were several occasions where the &quot;background&quot; music was too loud and despite repeated replays, we couldn&apos;t figure out what the character was saying.\n\nDespite the sound problems, the movie was FANTASTIC!!! It was a confluence of many disparate lives. It was a combination of the sophisticated &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot; and some of the sophistication of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;.\n\nThe cast (Steve Coogan, Rebecca Romijn, Sam Elliot and James Marsden) were terrific. The script was flawless. It&apos;s a complex story of a confidence man who juggles many different &quot;jobs&quot; and all the fallout which can and/or does happen.\n\nIf you liked the many faceted manipulations of strategy in Oceans Eleven and the sophistication of The Thomas Crown Affair, you&apos;ll love &quot;Lies &amp; Alibis&quot;.",

Matthew McConaughey is the perfect &quot;lovable loser&quot; (and yes, he&apos;s wrapped in nothing but a towel in the first two minutes!) Sarah Jessica Parker has that charm and smile that would melt anyone&apos;s heart. The supporting cast is great! Matthew&apos;s &apos;live at home bud&apos;s&apos; featuring Justin Bartha as &quot;Ace&quot; is the perfect &quot;nerd&quot; and Zooey Deschanel as &quot;Kit&quot; has a dry sense of humor often steals the scenes she shares with Sarah Jessica.

A plate-throwing dwarf? The grannies and grandpas getting ready for war? The colorful comic - like look? This one never wanted to be taken serious, and as long as you don&apos;t, you might enjoy it.

Sadly, the cast that looked so great on paper are largely wasted in this awful movie, an all-time low for all involved. The biggest problem was the script, which had no fun or wit whatsoever. You&apos;d be hard pressed to find any jokes, and when there are any glimpses of anything resembling one it was the kind that is better flushed down the toilet. The story is thinly structured and so poorly focused that it is very difficult to find anything interesting or easy to comprehend, while the characters have no likability or any sense of development, the direction from Ralph Thomas lacks life and has the feel that he didn&apos;t know what he was doing, the soundtrack feels misplaced and too much and it even looks amateurish. Leigh Lawson, in an attempt to give him greater exposure, is also rather bland in the lead role.\n\nOverall, the cast were promising but are (grossly) poorly utilised in a frankly infantile waste of time. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

That would already be a recipe for disaster, even though in reality Snyder was supervising.\n\nIn an attempt to live up to it&apos;s predecessor, 300: Rise of An Empire is action-packed, presents impressive visuals and is very bloody. In fact there is more action, more blood, and more nudity than in the original 300. As for the plot, there really isn&apos;t much to chew on. A naval commander, Themistocles is supposedly trying to reunite Greece. Since the story takes place before, during and after King Leonidas leads his men to fight the Persians, it can be hard to follow at times. \n\nMost of the acting was mediocre and couldn&apos;t quite compensate for the weaknesses in the story. The Australian actor cast as Themistocles in my opinion was a very bad choice, and comes nowhere close to what Gerard Butler did as King Leonidas in 300. He just doesn&apos;t bring that rugged heroic presence on screen as is expected. Interestingly I read somewhere that director Noam Murro insisted it would be Sullivan Stapleton who played this character, claiming he was &apos;the one&apos;. Eva Green on the other hand is plays an excellent villain as Artemisia.",

      "reviewBody": "Violent crime chiller about a relentless revenger . This is a gripping story of one man&apos;s revenge. An ex-military named Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson) whose family is wiped by a mobster, executes a revenge, originating a high body count with several enemies . Frank sets out to avenge his family, and he becomes a judge, jury and executioner known as &quot;The Punisher&quot;. As Castle carries out a bloody vengeance to punish mobsters and his associates in a one man war, as Castle is not willing to give up until those responsible are dead and until he has his revenge . Frank is moved to brutal violence and metes out his own justice when his wife and sons are murdered . He kills a lot of baddies , as tells a TV newsreader and still going on . After hunting down and killing hundreds of violent criminals, Frank Castle, aka The Punisher (Ray Stevenson , though Thomas Jane was originally attached for the lead role, but he turned it down, stating that he thought the script was going in the wrong direction) faces his most deadly foe yet : Jigsaw (Dominic West originally passed on the villain role , Paddy Considine was in talks to play the role, when he came back and accepted to play the part) . Castle sets out to killing gangsters, such as an one army man. Frank&apos;s ex-partner named Soap (Dash Mihok) helps him and a Fed named Budiansky(Colin Salmon , whose character was taken from the graphic novel Widowmaker) tries to catch him. Drawing upon all he has learned in twenty years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. Russoti or Jigsaw also wants revenge on Frank so he breaks out his brother (Doug Hutchinson) who is so crazed that he is committed to an asylum, to deal with him.\n\nThis exciting picture packs action packed, thrills, shootouts, chills and lots of violence, explosion , gore and guts . The huge body count racked up by Ray Stevenson/The Punisher is 81 confirmed kills, excluding the two cases where he shoots someone &quot;on the same side.&quot; The tale bears a remarkable resemblance with Charles Bronson films of the series &apos;Death wish&apos;, for the matter, the vengeance,as the starring becomes a hit man and acting as a judge, jury and executioner and no better the mobsters he&apos;s pursuing . Adapted for a Marvel Comics Group character and written Nick Santora and drawn by Gerry Conway ; being one of the few movies based on a Marvel Comic that doesn&apos;t appear as consultant Stan Lee , as seeing as he had absolutely no involvement with the creation of the original Punisher character ; however , here is the usual Avi Arad . Exhibited direct to video in some countries, though in Europe showed in theatres years later being realized . The Punisher movie is distributed by Lionsgate Films, who also distributes the ¬®Saw¬® movies , both movies series feature a homicidal villain nicknamed &quot;Jigsaw&quot; and both feature Julie Benz. ¬®Sons of Anarchy¬® creator Kurt Sutter wrote an R-rated draft that according to him &quot;taking the Punisher character out of the comic books&quot; and putting him into a real world drama set in the streets of New York. At the very last minute, the studio decided to revert back to Nick Santora&apos;s comic-book style script with the intention of creating a sequel from that ; disgusted with the actions by the studio, Sutter was offered a story credit, but refused, and demanded that his name omitted from the final credits. The motion picture was professionally directed by a good director woman , Lexi Alexander (Hooligans). \n\nOther adaptations about this famous comic book are the following : ¬®The Punisher¬®(1989) by Mark Glodblatt with Dolph Lundgren, Nancy Everhard , Jeroan Krabbe and Louis Gosset Jr , it was a flop and obtained lukewarm reception by the public , though nowadays is well considered . And superior version(2004) directed by Jonathan Hensleigh , starred by Thomas Jane, Rebeca Romijin Stamos and John Travolta achieved much success in the box office, in spite of the extreme violence and crude scenes . Its sequel was this ¬®Punisher : War zone ¬® , it&apos;s a must see for Ray Stevenson fans .",

I hope this is not the beginning of a whole crappy movie era...The crazy villain who seems to rule the city and has no fear of the cops, the Latina - victim, beautiful and scared...what is the matter with these clich√©s of the early 80-s? I couldn&apos;t wait for the movie to end and I feel sorry for Bruce Willis, hey man, better enjoy your retirement than act in such chaotic remakes of all the old cop movies!"

There are plot contrivances, like shoddy cellphone coverage and random injuries. Of course, there has to be poor cellphone coverage or there would be no movie! You would just call for help and that would be the end of the movie! There has to be injuries to add insult to &quot;injury&quot; to the players struggling against the odds already. The ending is truly thought evoking instead of clich√©. It could not have ended better. I recently saw the movie &quot;Thirst.&quot; The two movies are very similar in plot line.

      "reviewBody": "As recalled by a concussed, possibly deranged, man found floating in a life-raft, a downed U. S. bomber crew drifted onto an uncharted volcanic island inhabited by primeval creatures and by comely women who were the descendants of ancient Druid refugees and whose menfolk had recently been eradicated by rampaging cavemen. The story is sketchy and ludicrous, and is largely an excuse to recycle special effects footage from 1940&apos;s &apos;One Million BC&apos; (the source of &apos;dinosaur&apos; footage in a plethora of B-movies and TV programs) as the men pointlessly trudge through the monster-infested wastelands before returning to their starting point (only to be threatened by &apos;One Million BC&apos;s exploding volcano, lava and rockslides). The &apos;untamed women&apos; (or the &apos;dolls&apos; as they are frequently referred to) are statuesque, perfectly coiffed epitomes of early &apos;50&apos;s beauty and, of course, they immediately fall in love with the rugged American flyboys. Despite being a hold-over from a religion that faded away millennia ago, they speakith in a pseudo-Shakespearian English (verily, they soundith more like American Quakers than Elizabethans). No explanation is hazarded as to why the island is populated by antediluvian monsters and hirsute cavemen, so the women&apos;s diction is not the film&apos;s greatest mystery. The Americans include the usual Hollywood G. I. tropes, a wiseacre from Brooklyn, a farm-boy from Arkansas, etc and the script is essentially a series of clich√©s held together by occasional plot-driving sentences. No one would expect that acting ability was high on the list of prerequisites when casting the lovely Druidesses but the men are terrible (although they were probably up to the material they were given). For a film with an apparently negligible budget, the opening crash of the B17 is pretty well done (except for the scenes in the spartan cockpit) and the movie&apos;s ending is not as &apos;Hollywood&apos; as I smugly anticipated. Unfortunately for young men in the 1950&apos;s, the heights of the &apos;sexy cave-women&apos; genre would not be reached until Raquel Welch battled Mesozoic horrors in a fur-bikini in &apos;One Million Years BC&apos; (the 1966 remake of the Hal Roach classic that provided the aforementioned saurian beasties) or when Victoria Vetri left her primordial two-piece at the side of the swimming hole in 1970&apos;s &apos;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&apos;.",

Charles Butterworth&apos;s underplayed humor is very welcome in a minor role, while the unfunny slapstick subplot anchored by Charles Judels&apos; almost grotesque performance as Monsieur LeMaire throws the film off pitch whenever it resurfaces throughout. \n\nOverall, simple, predictable, and worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this with &quot;Riders of the Whistling Skull,&quot; which I swear I first saw decades ago. It was a movie about movies without self-knowledge. This is the opposite. It is from Hong Kong, possibly the most introspective film source we have (after Barcelona). The story is an Indiana Jones bit, just like the Whistling Skull: a treasure with cryptic clues that needs a woman to translate. \n\nIsn&apos;t that always the way? The men fight and dig and make the rationale, but the women see and know.\n\nThe gimmick here is that all the key male characters look like famous kung fu actors. They have similar names as well, and many of the jokes are built on this in the story. This element makes it mildly interesting: the deliberate, overt movie about movies, with as many weaves as can be made, from other movies, references and characters as famous actors (not famous characters).\n\nFrancis Ng, who wrote directed and stars, apparently specializes in this.\n\nPace Wu is lovely.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "reviewBody": "Lifeboat, the Hitchcock classic, defines the essence of the American super will in 1944. It pits the American melting pot irrationality and eccentricities against the single-minded rational Teutonic mind. Unlike the typical propaganda movies of its time, Lifeboat does not march without a reverse gear across the screen like John Wayne&apos;s boots. Lifeboat is circumspect, and asks profound questions about war, and values, and vulnerability. It second guesses itself. It wonders.\n\nA freighter is sunk by a German U-boat and the cast assembles in a solitary lifeboat on a cold gray Atlantic Ocean for a two hour emotional roller-coaster. 60 years ago, before there were true female heavyweight actresses like Brittany Spears or Meg Ryan, there was Tallulah Bankhead, a thinking man&apos;s dame with an Alabama drawl and no underwear. Apparently she wanted to keep the attention of the camera crew during filming; mission accomplished. Playing the lead role of Constance Porter, Tallulah was in her element as the clawed feisty sharp talking journalist ripping apart at will anyone that crossed her path especially alpha male want a be, John Kovac, played by John Hodiak. Ruggedly ugly, Hodiak, played an impulsive hotheaded boiler room brute that acted first and used thought only as a last resort. His persona was that of a man raised on the wrong side of the tracks, vigilant like a stray dog with the hair up on its back most of the time.\n\nThen there was Willy. Willy, played magnificently by Walter Slezak, was a rescued German U-boat sailor, ultimately unmasked as the Captain of the U-boat that sunk the freighter. Willy spoke perfect English. He knew the sea, navigation and knew how to survive. He was superior in intellect, physical strength, and cunning. Not only was he capable of saving Gus Smith&apos;s life by a surgical amputation of his leg, he also pushed Gus overboard when it was clear that Gus, played by William Bendix was dying and essentially wasting the survival resources of the others in the boat.\n\nOther characters providing color included a young Hume Cronyn, hard to believe he was ever young, and famous cigar chewing character actor grouch, Charles Rittenhouse who played Henry Hull, ironically, a shipping tycoon. Other players had various levels of incompetence and mental instability.\n\nWhat does this movie say? It says that Americans can only stand so much rational logic before they explode, even if the rational logic initially saves their lives. It frames the basis of ethical reasoning. For example who do you give a heart transplant to, a scientist or a street person who waltzes into the door two seconds before the scientist? Willy would give the heart to the scientist because he weighs the society above the individual, and the rest of the boat would give it to the street person, not because it is rational but because they base ethics on human equality, and seek to find some measure of &apos;fairness&apos; as the basis of ethical decision making. While American society may tout the virtues of this kind of sentiment, they are not really that comfortable with it. Watching a street person with a newly transplanted heart swill down a bottle of Thunderbird wine is not particularly gratifying when at the same time the Nobel Laureate is being laid to rest, perhaps just short of a discovery that could have saved millions of lives. And this is precisely what the movie does in the end. It leaves us uncertain about our own brutality in the name of our version of ethical fairness. It also makes us question our own sense of reason and logic. What possible virtue is there in a society that shuns reasoning? This is the point that Hitchcock makes so cleverly. He leaves us with a sense of fear, from both a tough intelligent rational enemy, but also from a wild brutish killing wrought out of self-fear and ending with an uncomfortable lynch mob sense of justice. This was not a killing of self-defense; it was a killing of berserk passion and loss of control. These were after all, not soldiers, but they were us, suffering from a global war with no end in sight. Frustrated by a relentless predatory machine-like enemy, that could torpedo unarmed freighters, yet smile and tell jokes while rowing toward an enemy rescue ship.\n\nLifeboat is a movie of huge depth. If the brain aspects of the movie don&apos;t appeal to you, you may want to see the movie just to get a glimpse of Tallulah so you could actually see what a real woman once looked like before they became extinct in the sea of 18 year old tattooed tongue-pierced pop culture nothings and crack smoking &apos;super-models&apos; that masquerade these days as &apos;American womanhood&apos;. And you wonder why men don&apos;t want to marry anymore."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s no surprise that some of the most effective works of the Beatnik generation were born in the scuzzy halls of jazz bars; soaked with whiskey induced grammar, intoxicated with muddled philosophies, their pages bathed in the permanent smell of tobacco. Much like the work of Lewis Carroll, drugs, alcohol, and culture were catalysts towards the ideology of destroying the old and building the new. The movement itself was a rousing feat with great cultural ramifications. The film itself is a work that sometimes trades in the grainy for flashy; rupturing not only the pattern that the authors were trying to break, but the whole tone of the film as well.\n\nIf I pitched you a story about the Beat generation led by Harry Potter, the new Harry Osborne, a guy from X-Men and the guy from Boardwalk Empire with half his face missing, I&apos;m sure the reaction would be pretty great. Unfortunately for audiences, the subject matter submits to a truly unauthentic, lack lustre festival formula and abandons creativeness and a unique vision for a familiar narrative that disregards great historical figures, making them caricatures within a lame murder/mystery genre film.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe plays Allen Ginsberg, one of the most famous and recognizable poets in the American culture. Radcliffe continues to shed his &apos;Hogwarts alumni&apos; image by taking risky, unconventional and edgy roles that all share in their seemingly controversial nature. Upon his acceptance and arrival into Columbia University, Ginsberg is in search of something offbeat. Ironically enough, Ginsberg is lured into the residency of Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), an intoxicated sociopath with an obsession for self-destruction, always curious for the taste of the complicated and unexplainable.\n\nTogether, Carr and Ginsberg start a small revolution in their heads, but without so many words. With the help of an unlimited supply of cannabis and some Johnny Walker, the two eventually enlist of the help of William Burroughs (Ben Foster) and a young Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and begin their uprising. Through constant disruptions by the reputation and prestige Columbia University holds so true and dear to its heart, the constantly stoned literary bandits are engulfed into a world of lovers, obsession and murder, intent on revolutionizing literature.\n\nKill Your Darlings starts bold and overwhelming, demanding utmost attention. Unfortunately, once attention is given, the film cannot hold its grip and deliver a rousing, culturally relevant story about some of the most influential figures in contemporary literature in the last century. Blending the lines of drug induced fantasy and reality, Kill Your Darlings is a story of breaking the formulaic path, distrusting all conventional and predictable beats of rhyme and meter, but sadly becomes a textbook festival entry with a forgettable conclusion.\n\nThe term to &apos;kill your darlings&apos; is one that suggests destroying all the conventions and comforts of the mundane, reinventing yourself, and throwing inhibition to the wind and finding creativity will inspire instances of utter uniqueness. Kill Your Darlings, although sometimes confident, is an obsessive and complicated re-telling of enigmatic characters placed in a deceitful and over-dramatized tragedy of murder. With the rich historical and cultural imprint of these feisty literary pioneers, so much of the busy murder antics is clearly overshadowing the brilliant opportunity to showcase the likes of Carr, Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac.\n\nMixing the potential monologue moments of Weir&apos;s 1989 Dead Poets Society with the tone and ambiance of Salle&apos;s 2004 masterpiece The Motorcycle Diaries, Kill Your Darlings becomes a self- inflicted suicide of a film with a tantalizing and promising narrative. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the performances are top notch; DeHaan is magnificent as Carr and Radcliffe is radiant as Ginsberg. However, while most of the top-billed cast is ravishing, and supporting cast is spot on, the film feels drowned in the water with average narrative clich√©s weighing it down.\n\nWhile the antics of the underbelly of the New York Greenwich Village scene have been explored, battered, bruised and forever changed by the provocative and decadent Beat Movement, Kill Your Darlings remains a tame snippet of the life of these amazing authors and thinkers. Destined to be an example of a complicated festival biography attempt, the film will positively spark deep discussion. Kill Your Darlings repeats the initial reaction to Carr&apos;s response to Ginsberg&apos;s complicated life, &quot;Perfect. I love complicated.&quot; Hopefully next time, an autobiographical cinematic take on the origins of the Beat Generation will be less gimmicky and more focused on the howling affect these fascinating individuals had on the world of literature, art, and our contemporary culture as a whole.",

      "reviewBody": "Robert Aldrich has directed an entertaining, though far from serious retelling, of the Old Testament saga. The story starts out sticking close to the original. Lot ( Stewart Granger) decides to split with his Uncle Abraham and take his group of Hebrews on a different route as they make their nomadic way across the desert. Of course they come upon the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The characters they meet there are bigger than life. The Queen of Sodom is wickedly played by the wonderful Anouk Aimee. She rules the twin cities of the Plain with her leering brother portrayed by Stanley Baker. They both have a ball chewing the scenery and seducing whomever strikes their fancy. The Queen has the eye for young female beauties. Her brother has an eye for both of Lot&apos;s daughters. These fun plot additions are distinct divergences from the Old Testament tale. Lot himself falls for the slave girl (Pier Angeli). Royal intrigues and political betrayals run rampant. There are also some good action sequences. One in particular has the Hebrews protecting the cities from invading intruders by destroying a dam they have built inundating their enemies as Moses would do centuries later. Of course, the spectacular finale is the destruction of the cities followed by the Pillar of Salt transformation of Lot&apos;s wife. The script writers have left out the tidbit about Lot&apos;s own daughters getting him drunk and taking him to bed because they think they are the last people on earth. I guess that was a bit too racy for the audiences in 1962. &quot;Sodom &amp; Gomorrah&quot; came at the tail end of the cycle of biblical spectacles. It certainly wasn&apos;t the worst. Its entertainment value includes a superb score by Miklos Rozsa which raises all of the fighting and heavy breathing to a higher level than one would expect."

      "reviewBody": "My status as a film buff seems to exist in two separate states. On the one hand, I will wax lyrical about the subtle genius of Godard, Fassbinder, and Bertolucci. I&apos;ll watch pretentious European art-house cinema of the most stereotypical variety without even a hint of irony. I will regard Ingmar Bergman as a literal god-figure to worshiped in all of his glory. On the other hand, I will spend forty-plus dollars on a blu-ray of Dario Argento&apos;s Phenomena and gush over the sheer lunacy of B-movies. Demons (or Demoni, in its native Italy) is everything a geek like me could want. Gratuitous gore and violence, questionable dubbing, explosions, and a kick-ass eighties soundtrack. Co-written and produced by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento (Suspiria, Deep Red), Demons came from Argento&apos;s desire to create a purely commercial film after tasting such success with 1978&apos;s Dawn of the Dead. Thus, Demons is a film with little in the way of a coherent plot or deep characterization. And yet somehow it manages to be wholly appealing at the same time. The plot, which follows the spread of a zombie-like form of demonic possession spreading through a Berlin movie theater, exists solely to facilitate the numerous action and scare sequences. The score by Argento regular Claudio Simonetti (of Goblin fame) manages to be exciting, creepy, and perfectly suited to adrenaline-soaked visuals. This film is entertainment, pure and simple. To anyone looking to get into B-movies or Italian horror (or better yet, both) I highly recommend this film as it&apos;s a very accessible entry point into both genres. Just sit back, open a can of Coke, shut your brain off, and prepare to have the time of your life.",

There is no question that if I Love Lucy had been re-casted with Crawford and Gable as Lucy and Ricky, the results would have been hilarious. Also, Franchot Tone gives one the more hilarious performances as Gable&apos;s news reporter chum and rival. Tone would have played an extremely amusing Fred Mertz. The story is so upbeat and so amusing that it is virtually impossible to find anything about it to dislike. The story has snappy dialog, farcical plot, engaging characters and excellent cinematography. Any movie that features Crawford, Gable and Tone running around France and getting into all kinds of silly trouble is a movie that will entertain.",

      "reviewBody": "There is so much to like and appreciate about this film that while it&apos;s an enjoyable experience, it isn&apos;t the great film it should have been.\n\nFirstly, the script is largely excellent. It has a good plot and characters backed up by interesting dialogue. It has a top-notch cast delivering almost universally quality performances. As well, it has some interesting themes and issues to explore, especially in the central battle between Fonda&apos;s warden and Douglas&apos; prisoner. The scene where Douglas confronts Fonda in the just built eating hall and exposes his self-serving interests and hypocrisy, is a great example of top-class screen writing.\n\nAll the elements are there for a classic (or at least semi-classic) Western, but it doesn&apos;t quite reach that. Why? I think a big problem for this is Joseph L. Mankiewicz&apos;s direction. As other users have commented, the tone of the film is jerky and erratic and he has to take prime blame for that. But even in pure cinematic terms, it isn&apos;t well directed. Scenes that should have been highlights (such as the robbery that opens the film) lack punch because they&apos;re ineptly handled.\n\nI think another major problem is the cinematography. The glossy, bright and flashy look of TWACM seems more in tune for a jovial, knockabout, straightforward Western. For a film full of cynicism, complexity (as well as its share of humour) and some rather depressing elements, it&apos;s a distracting and misjudged look. The much more realistic style that was to become much more common in films as the 1970s progressed (e.g. &apos;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&apos;) would have been much more apt.\n\nOverall, an under-appreciated and underrated film worth seeking out. But also a bit of a missed opportunity.",

Apparently there has been a bout with polio in the community (paralysis) and there is a pretty young victim who the doctor fancies as looking like his late daughter. He makes it his life work to cure her. Unfortunately, he needs the bodily fluids of others to bring about that cure. Of course, he chooses the base, the outcast, for his work because the young pretty girl has more worth in the society than these others. He chooses his victims by judging this worth. He kills them by dressing in the skin of an ape that he killed and skinned. If this sounds silly, it&apos;s hard to defend. There&apos;s also a subplot of the jealousy of a young man who loves the young woman but may feel if she recovers she will reject him. Karloff&apos;s doctor is the constant victim of the community. They don&apos;t know what he&apos;s doing in that house and so he is victimized by the local kids (your garden variety brats), and looked on with suspicion. He is such a kindly man, it seems odd that there is such venom when it comes to him. Anyway, it&apos;s a small town and people do need their preoccupations. It just seems that a doctor with this much imagination could be a little more creative in his methods than the one he chooses. Imagine how lacking in dexterity if you were about 60 years old, running around in an ape pelt. It&apos;s rather forgettable and predictable, but it&apos;s fun to see Karloff&apos;s character.",

The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.\n\nCold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn&apos;t paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn&apos;t get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It&apos;s incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it&apos;s fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.\n\nI wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it&apos;s a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock.",

      "name": "A masked wrestling beauty in the mood of the Batman from the 60&apos;s",
      "reviewBody": "Batgirl is a rich woman that fights crime disguised with a mask in order to hide her secret identity. OK, you know that story, it&apos;s the same as Batman&apos;s. Indeed, her mask, cloak and car are very similar to the ones that Adam West wears and uses in the classic TV series. Though, this Batgirl is neither Barbara Gordon, commissioner Gordon&apos;s daughter, nor any other heroine created by DC Comics. This one is a Mexican pro wrestler! You can call her &quot;Mujer Murci√©lago&quot;, &quot;Bat Woman&quot; in Spanish. Few people knows the true identity of this marvelous crime fighter who lives in Mexico City and works as a special agent for the police. As many luchadores are being mysteriously murdered in Acapulco, local police calls a special agent who contacts her as a partner to solve the case. Off course this is not a great film and does not have an innovative plot, but it is certainly not bad either. As a matter of fact, it is not very different from the stories of Batman&apos;s adventures from the 60&apos;s, as it is intended to get a ride in its success, although it is much less campy than Batman &amp; Robin series or feature movie from that decade. In Mexican &quot;La Mujer Murci√©lago&quot;, there is an archvillain who is a mad scientist with a dire laugh who lives in a yacht called Reptilicus - very cartoonish, isn&apos;t it? Guess what is the name of his assistant: Igor, the same used in many Frankenstein films! During the movie, the mad scientist, Dr. Williams, acquires a Two-Face appearance while fighting Batgirl, but not the coin-flipping craziness. While analyzing this movie, it is unavoidable to mention that Maura Monti, the Italian actress who portrays the heroine with big breasts and long eyelashes, is extremely beautiful. Unsurprisingly, there is some exploitation in the movie, showing her in bikini very often - yes, a masked Batgirl in bikini! -, but at least there are no nude or sex scenes, which are common in sexploitation B movies. The masked heroine, besides her wrestling skills, is also a super athlete and a diver. She also has gadgets and is very clever, like Adam West&apos;s Batman, being able to find solutions unrelated to her fighting and athletic abilities. Among the movie&apos;s flaws, I may mention that soundtrack is very bad and acting is not the most inspired. Piscis, the amphibious monster created by Dr. Williams, is quite ridiculous (though, not more than the monsters from Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; and &quot;super sentai&quot; TV shows), basically a red version of the Sleestak from &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. The stuntwoman in the wrestling scenes has a very different body from Maura Monti, not convincing that she is the same person, in spite of the face being hidden by the mask. And the last but not least: come on, it is nonsense that a super heroine screams and faints in panic when she sees the monster (who she had already known!)! The final scene is also silly and sexist, but the film is overall amusing, much better than one may initially expect.",

It has a strong sense of narrative that drives the film, with enough twists to thwart the viewer when he thinks he already sees what&apos;s to come next. Certain scenes offer up subtle but truthful commentaries regarding man&apos;s mediated communication through technology, man&apos;s mediated relationships, and the obvious message of the first--abuse spawns more abuse.\n\nThis sequel is as good as the first in its attempt to create a world all too real and similar to our own yet with its own quirks and rules that gives possible space for the supernatural narrative. There may be times when the film lags with certain scenes that stay too long on screen but the general idea is one worth watching, not to mention the killer ending! :)",

Eres mi h√©roe (2003) with its fictitious Indian/Antonio Dechent counselling the kid , follows the style to ¬®A Galope Tendido¬® (2000) the latter regarding a boy haunted by a cowboy/Sancho Gracia and ¬®Tongue of Butterflies¬®(1999) concerning a student/Manuel Lozano himself and his intimate teacher/Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez . Director Antonio Cuadri , also writes the interesting script, filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thought-provoking issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . The flick can be defined as a realist drama , a romantic tale, a historic fresco and a socio-political fable , but finally resulting in a sensitive tale in which a little boy learns that one of the most fundamental and enduring things in life is true friendship. The main problem has to face , beyond not being able to avoid falling into the politic pamphlet is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging -at times- , being excessively maudlin and containing some slow-moving scenes . Because the story needs a vibration more real than the one offered in this sometimes joyful as well as sad flick , though also contains humorous and enjoyable moments a when the children are gathered and play and enjoy themselves and of course the stirring , moving ending . Anyway, it&apos;s is compensated with the great interpretations from Antonio Dechent , Tony Cant√≥ and the little boy Manuel Lozano , a true boy prodigy , interpreters who provided a considerable boost to the result . Antonio Cuadri is a great director of actors and the main players are complemented by a good cast of secondaries as Maru Valdivielso , Toni Cant√≥ , Antonio Dechent , Juan Fern√°ndez , Martxelo Rubio and brief appearance by Carmen Ruiz , among others ; all of them forming a powerful human group of support cast and giving excellent acting .\n\nSpecial mention for magnificent musical score by Carita Boronska who composes an evocative as well as catching musical score . Including a spotless pictorial cinematography by Alex Catal√°n and a willingness , almost perfect of the elements of each shot , every sequence , every space , being shot mostly in Sevilla , Andalucia . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Antonio Cuadri . It won some prizes and nominations , such as : Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival 2003 Winner Jury Award : Young Actor&apos;s Award ,Manuel Lozano and Pe√±√≠scola Comedy Film Festival 2003 Winner Best Director. Writer/director Antonio Cuadri was born in Huelva (Andalucia) location where he shot his main and big-budgeted film titled ¬®The heart of the earth¬® with an international cast . Cuadri is a fine craftsman with some hits , such as ¬®La Gran Vida¬® with Selma Hayek , Carmelo G√≥mez , this¬®Eres Mi Heroe¬® and previously made a documentary titled ¬®Riotinto (2004)¬®. Nowadays , he only directs TV episodes (Cuentame, Manolito Gafotas , UCO , Todos Hombres Sois Iguales , Al Salir De Clase , among them). Eres mi h√©roe (2003) rating : 6.5/10 . Well worth watching . Better than average.",

      "reviewBody": "Joachim Trier has definitely accomplished something with his debut feature film. The opening sequence is so disorienting that you can&apos;t begin to expect what will happen next. Showing a montage of what &quot;could&quot; happen once our two leads mail out their manuscripts, from success to failure to meeting again and succeeding together, is a bold move. I wasn&apos;t sure if we had just been privy to the entire film condensed and would soon see the details, or if the title of the film would be taken literally and we&apos;d see a Reprise of the events. Of course, the latter is what occurred. After the montage, we are transported back to that fateful moment of their first novels being submitted for publishing. This time, however, in the real world, only Phillip succeeds in getting a book deal done while Erik is rejected to try again. Both young men then find their lives going in different directions only to converge once more at a dark place for both, a time for a rebirth in life for Phillip and career for Erik.\n\nThe gimmick of showing the audience multiple vignettes of the past throughout the film never seems forced. Always seamlessly giving us insight and background into the proceedings, these teleportations through time help flesh out our characters and their motivations. We learn how these two writers got mixed up with a group of friends a little rougher around the edges than them, how Phillip and his girlfriend Kari met, the boys&apos; affinity for author Sten Egil Dahl, and much more. The most brilliant use is when Phillip and Kari go to Paris to relive the journey that made them fall in love the first time. A trip where he hopes to regain those feelings he had been programmed to forget during his stint in a mental hospital, the mixing of scenes from the first time and this current time are nice. The dialogue is overlapping the images, sporadically rejoining with the mouth movements of the characters before getting unsynched again. Words and images don&apos;t necessarily have to converge here, whether it the voice of the leads or that of the narrator. A story is being told; we are shown what could happen in their lives, not necessarily the end all.\n\nWhen the final black screen of Stop is shown, you begin to wonder what other way the story could have gone. What could have happened if Erik found initial success and not Phillip? Would the latter&apos;s psychosis still have cropped up? Would Erik have fallen fast into pretentiousness like fellow writer Mathis Wergeland? Who knows? Trier just gives us a glimpse of this one way that it can happen, and for once it is not the easy way out. What continues on as a tragedy, one where you can just feel something horrific will occur, to the point where the director puts us in a sequence that screams suicide is made all the more powerful by the prospect of happiness at the end. The opening introduction ends on a happy note, so there is always hope the meat of the film will too, despite the allusions to epic tragedy of Icarus flying too close to the sun.\n\nOverall, the actual activity of writing a novel has little to do with the meaning of the film. It is just the occupation of these two men, the driving force of their lives and impetus for how they live. What Reprise truly concerns is the meaning of life and how one chooses to live it. It is a cyclical path bringing people in and out of each other&apos;s vision for good or worse at the most random times. Relationships play a huge role as well, whether they are romantic or platonic. Erik and Phillip have a bond with one another, a bond that had been forged at a very young age. The two compete yet also prop the other up when they need it most. At times there is jealousy and hatred, but never at their cores. The inclusion of Lillian and Kari only show both men&apos;s insecurities in themselves; Erik keeping Lillian away from the friends he hangs with and Phillip unable to accept the profound love he has for Kari. Both writers have dreams, but they are young, and achieving them too fast can have a profound effect on even the strongest soul.\n\nThis strong story and deftly handled craft is bolstered by a couple brilliant performances. Sure the group is fun to join with on their excursions¬óa party towards the end is a lot of fun¬óyet the main three shine above all else. Viktoria Winge is stunning as Kari, so deeply in love with her broken man, she is willing to pick up the pieces of their relationship after his time away getting help. Trying her hardest to stay patient with Phillip, she does everything in her power to make him remember what it was they felt upon meeting, to smile at the memory of him saying they were always destined to meet and be together. Espen Klouman-H√∏iner as Erik is very good as well. He is the rock of the group, the one with his head on straight always attempting to help those around him, sometimes at the neglect of himself. At the end, when faced with the dilemma of staying around to help or going away from Oslo to clear his mind and hone his apparent skills from his first novel, the decision weighs deeply upon him. Lastly, and most importantly, is Ander Danielsen Lie portraying Phillip. A deeply emotive soul, he is one who needs to break and fail in order to except the fact that he is fallible. Getting all he wants so early only eats away at him, making him feel that it is undeserved. Needing to find alignment again, it takes time and pain to be able to live once more is happiness.",

The inner story introduces themes like morality, limits and bravery that can give insight to young audiences specifically, but also adults. The CGI is acceptable despite its flaws, but especially the score by composer Magnus Beite is beautiful even though it&apos;s not unique. I could personally listen to it the whole day. Despite the movie&apos;s simplicity, it contains some good humor and it&apos;s mostly engaging. Overall, it&apos;s an appropriate suspenseful movie for the Christmas holiday.\n\nDespite its straightforward narrative and some cheesy moments, this is a heartwarming and engaging fantasy movie that offers valuable lessons on morality, limits, and bravery. The beautiful score and occasional humor further enhance the viewing experience, making it a suitable choice for families with small children during the Christmas season.",

This is a tragic movie about the love of a woman and about the total selfish attitude of a man, who has his wife, home, family -- and wants to keep his young lover too.",

      "name": "A raunchy sex comedy that starts off sweet but becomes sour all too quickly",
      "reviewBody": "I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.\n\nJamie (Kunis) is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan (Justin Timberlake) land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends, and after a discussion about their relationship failures, decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz (hence the titular phrase). But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.\n\nRather surprisingly, the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and one-liners drop at a steady pace, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film, and how well co-writer/director Will Gluck (who knocked Easy A out of the park last year) helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies, and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre, and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious, but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky (which the trailers have ruined slightly), but helped add to the humour.\n\nExcept the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.\n\nWhile sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.\n\nKunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script&apos;s weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable.\n\nPatricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances, but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman (who I did not realize was still acting) does a little better in a warm and significantly low-key role as Dylan&apos;s sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously over-the-top, but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own, and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film&apos;s best dialogue quips, and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance, Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.\n\nIn the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti- romantic comedy, and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however, and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.\n\n7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Hersey Cok Guzel Olacak is one of the best products contemporary Turkish cinema can offer, with its modest but solid direction, clever script, and outstanding acting. It is the story of two brothers living in Istanbul, with very different characters, world views, and ambitions. Their differences prove effective as the generator of the comedic effect, although -in my opinion- this movie is also a solid drama rather than a simple comedy.\n\nAltan, played by the ever-popular stand-up comedian Cem Yilmaz, is a penniless dreamer, who has plans to open his own pub. He decides to steal some prescription drugs from his brother&apos;s pharmacy, and sell them to the mafia in order to get the capital necessary quickly. Long story short, the two brothers find themselves on a dangerous road trip to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, and adventure unfolds.\n\nIn his first serious on-screen job, Cem Yilmaz seems surprisingly able in his portrayal of Altan, and demonstrates that he can really act. Mazhar Alanson, who is the lead singer of arguably the best pop music group in Turkey, is also worthy of praise as the older brother. Not many know that he was actually trained as a thespian, and he reminds the audience of this fact with his commanding presence in the film. The late master Selim Nasit also gives his last performance as their father.\n\nThe movie is exceptionally good, clever, consistently fascinating, warm and funny. Labelling it one of the best of Turkish cinema will not be an exaggeration.",

From feeding beef cattle to harvesting Irish potatoes we get fine quality shots that include so much information both close-up and deep shots.

      "name": "A rousing action film with an  awesome cast , thrills and lots of violence",
      "reviewBody": "The picture deals with an assassin (Laurence Fishburne) along with a group of delinquents (J.A Rule , John Leguizamo) are led to prison by security policemen (Kim Coates and Dorian Harewood) and during a snowstorm find shelter in a sleepy police station and almost locked out due to demolition . Precinct is commanded by a sergeant (Ethan Hawke) and there are an old police (Brian Dennehy) , a secretary (Drea De Matteo) and a psychologist (Maria Bello). Police station in ghetto district 13 is suddenly under siege and itself surrounded by violent gangmen heavily super-armed with technological weapons and helicopter . The opponents attackers sworn revenge about the murderer now inside the precinct 13 . \n\nFilm captures the special excitement or mood of paranoia that those under siege live for the night . Psychosis abounds when the policeman and prisoners are attacked from all sides and can see no way out making desperate tryings to flee . Film has maximum tension , noisy action , emotion and thriller from the subsequents attempts by the violent stalkers to enter in the station and the besieged to survive or getaway for prevention of the seemingly inevitable final . From the initiation of the movie to the end action-packed and suspense is unstopped . A very exciting storyline by James De Monaco though much-copied and superb casting make this one of the best thrillers made in that year . The picture is an adaptation of the semi-acclaimed John Carpenter film with the same title what also was a rendition of Howard Hawks&apos;s ¬®Rio Bravo¬® and the remakes the ¬®Dorado¬® and ¬®Rio Lobo¬® ,that were developed in a besieged jail defended by a tough John Wayne and helped by a misfit bunch . Flick will appeal to action movies lovers . Rating : Above average.",

Images that are a cross between science fiction and an industrial film. Carefully composed and framed in Cinemascope.&quot;\n\nWhat are we seeing? Neurons, radioactive tracings. A uranium fuel rod. The control room.\n\nWhat are we hearing? The hum of electricity.\n\nAdmitted to workplaces and meetings, we see men committed to ensuring that nothing happens. These places are overwhelmingly male. Cheesy girly calendars are everywhere.\n\nAn industry abandoned. What to do with unused plants. An amusement park in an abandoned plant. A scary twirling ride inside a cooling tower.\n\n&quot;In the water basin of a research reactor, our gaze falls on a magic light that veils a fuel rod downright mystically. The bluish glow penetrates even solid matter. Physicists call this phenomenon the &apos;Cherenkov effect.&apos; Unleashed by the splitting atoms, hidden with this uncanny illumination is extremely intense radioactivity.&quot;",

Marianne S√§gebrecht is &quot;Marianne&quot; the mortician&apos;s assistant whose life is as dead as her customers. She rides to work on the subway, listens to the negative comments about her by ladies in the local shops, and takes an occasional swim at the local pool when she needs to just get away and think. All that changes the day she spots Huber, the young handsome subway driver. What chance would a fat middle aged mortician&apos;s assistant have of seducing a young handsome blonde man? Marianne proves that hope springs eternal. I enjoyed this film when it was played on Showtime in the late 1980&apos;s and I recently tracked down a copy to see it again.",

      "reviewBody": "You know what this reminds me of? Godard&apos;s &quot;Breathless,&quot; one of the first of the shockingly original Nouvelle Vague flicks of the early 60s. I remember first seeing &quot;Breathless&quot; with some friends in a theater in Ithaca, NY, and emerging arguing about what it meant. I don&apos;t mean trying to identify any great load of symbolism or moral lesson it might be towing behind it. I just mean, what happened, and why? As I recall we decided that &quot;Breathless&quot; was an &quot;existential&quot; movie and didn&apos;t really need to be specific about what was going on. It was a story about a man making a life choice. You can be or do anything you want, said Sartre, and you can break all the rules -- as long as you&apos;re willing to take the consequences.\n\nIn &quot;Miami Blues&quot; the Belmondo part is played by Alec Baldwin, a guy fresh out of prison who has chosen a life of wilful disobedience. His girl friend (who really ought not to be in college) is a part-time hooker with aspirations that are utterly bourgeois. Jennifer Jason Lee wants to live with her husband and babies in a house with a white picket fence. Fred Ward, looking grizzled and great, is a homicide detective whom Baldwin clobbers and whose identity he steals.\n\nI don&apos;t know why certain things happen. For instance, I have no idea how or why Baldwin manages to dig up Ward&apos;s home address, then goes there and beats hell out of him, and winds up stealing his false teeth, handcuffs and other cop accoutrements. What was THAT all about? I&apos;ll give one more example. Baldwin is in a convenience store and stumbles on an armed robbery. &quot;I&apos;m the police! Drop that gun and walk out of here!&quot; he shouts -- and threatens the armed robber with a jar of spaghetti sauce.\n\nSee, in an existentialist movie like this, the characters don&apos;t really need to have motives. They do whatever they feel like doing.\n\nThere IS continuity though, even if in its details the movie makes very little sense. The characters are consistent, and there is a rudimentary plot, engaging and amusing without being in any way memorable.\n\nI did enjoy the movie though, even the second time around, or maybe even MORE the second time around, since I&apos;d learned not to expect an abundance of logic in the narrative.\n\nThe acting of the three principles is also admirable. Alec Baldwin had just appeared in &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; in which he struck me as not much more than a handsome leading man. Here, he&apos;s a different character entirely. Watch him as he struts down the street, arms swinging jauntily, grinning through pain, happily throwing off non sequiturs in dramatic situations. (&quot;Do you own a suede coat?&quot; he asks a criminal before murdering him.) Lee is more than childlike. She&apos;s positively childish with her overflowing emotions. I loved Fred Ward in this. He&apos;s full of quirks and rarely seems to be taking the role seriously. Instead of soaking his precious false teeth in -- what is that stuff, Polydent? -- he soaks them overnight in a glass of left-over booze.\n\nInteresting exercise in style and acting.",

      "reviewBody": "You realise that millennia of civilisation have been quite useless if the functioning of a whole community ultimately depends on whether a man can have an erection or not! The subject of Mauro Bolognini&apos;s movie Il Bell&apos;Antonio ¬ñ male impotence ¬ñ would be audacious in 2006, let alone in 1960. Yet here, it&apos;s treated with unflinching honesty, one that surprised me for 1960. No euphemisms, no sensationalism, no malicious elbow-nudging, nor sentimental melodrama, but a heart-on-the-sleeve openness which also allows its long-suffering hero to maintain his dignity through a fierce portrait of a ruthlessly paternalistic society. This is all done without the aid of a single sex-scene, which IMO would have been redundant.\n\nThe movie shows us upper-class Sicily in the late 1950s (though actually, it&apos;s based upon a novel set in the 1930s ¬ñ Fascist-era Italy). This is a society in which appearing is the essence of being and the accepted norm are arranged marriages between the children of the richest families, celebrated by the entire town in the same way as Prince Charles and Diana Spencer&apos;s was back in the early 80s. As is the case with the best classic Italian movies, Il Bell&apos;Antonio couples bitterness/fierce social satire with comedy/humour seamlessly. Superb leads in the form of the timeless Marcello Mastroianni and the divine Claudia Cardinale, impeccably playing an unpleasant character for once, give the movie extra depth, beauty and soulfulness. Claudia is Barbara Puglisi, the &quot;golden girl&quot; that Antonio is expected to marry, the daughter of one of the richest families on the island and a virginal social-climber of the most conventional, blinkered, obtusely stubborn kind. The even greater tragedy is that despite their marriage having been arranged by their families, Antonio really falls for her very badly.\n\nMarcello Mastroianni, who neither as an actor nor as a man remotely deserved to be considered the typical &quot;Latin lover&quot; type that Hollywood producers wished to market him as, plays the titular lead, the &quot;beautiful&quot; Antonio Magnano. On the verge of 30, in his prime as far as looks, health and opportunities are concerned, Antonio has just returned to his native Sicilian city of Catania after having lived in Rome for three years. We very quickly gather that Antonio is from an upper class Sicilian family, is the apple of his father and mother&apos;s eye, and something of a superstar in the whole of Catania, where his family is well-known and respected. He is adored by women, who believe him to be an irresistible seducer, a Casanova with hundreds of notches on his bed-post. He is also courted by important men, all dying to act as his patrons in some prestigious profession or the other. Women&apos;s heads make 90-degree turns when he walks into a room, and older ladies gasp in wonder at his handsomeness from their balconies when he walks past them, fantasising that he may become their son-in-law. Antonio&apos;s father is played by Pierre Brasseur, who receives much praise in reviews of the movie. In my opinion, he is actually the least credibly cast actor in this movie, losing out to Rina Morelli who plays his wife, Antonio&apos;s mother (she really comes into her own in a memorable &quot;showdown&quot; scene between herself and Claudia Cardinale in a church, and in the second half of the movie generally). On the other hand, so many of Brasseur&apos;s expressions and mannerism betray a blatant Frenchness, rather than a credible Italianness, or even better, a Sicilianness.\n\nMr Magnano Senior swells with pride at the very thought of his son&apos;s alleged sexual prowess and reputation. He pretty much bases much of the reasons for boosting his family&apos;s public image precisely on Antonio being able to continue the virile oeuvre started by himself, in his youthful days, all over Sicily! With such a premise, you just know that the movie&apos;s dramatic climax is going to be the ruinous fall from glory experienced by the poor Antonio, who seemingly carries the weight of the whole of Sicily&apos;s expectations on his all too human shoulders right from the start! It&apos;s as if this poor man were expected to lift the whole island up with his erection. You don&apos;t expect the extent of the tyranny of such a patriarchal society on its male children. The story of the dishonoured girl cast out of her society certainly finds a male equivalent in Il Bell&apos;Antonio.\n\nAlso worthy of note is the Cuban actor Tomas Milian playing Edoardo, Antonio&apos;s cousin, the only sane, rational and detached voice among a chorus of shrill scandal-mongers. It&apos;s thanks to this character that we get to hear Antonio finally speak at the end of the movie, telling us his first-hand experience as an impotent Sicilian man catastrophically fallen from glory. I do wonder if before or since this movie, such an honest and charitable, as well as credible psychological study of male sexual problems has ever been filmed - perhaps in part only in Sex, Lies and Videotape. The conclusion of Antonio&apos;s story exemplifies the bitterest and most satirical form of so-called &quot;happy ending&quot; ¬ñ if the movie weren&apos;t already so good overall, the ending would be worth the watch alone! For any fan of classic Italian cinema, this will be a rare treat indeed. If you love Mastroianni, you simply cannot afford to miss this. And for any fan of cinema generally¬Ö ditto.\n\nThe literary source the movie is based upon, the Sicilian writer Vitaliano Brancati&apos;s novel of the same title, furthermore lends itself perfectly to this dual mood of fierce social satire and classic Italian comedy. Few men of letters have pinpointed the true natural of latter-day Southern Italian machismo as well as Brancati. Clich√©-free, with such an eye for the absurd, the comical, the down-right frightening and angering, I highly recommend not only Il Bell&apos;Antonio, but also all of Vitaliano&apos;s major novels: it wasn&apos;t just Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and his novel The Leopard who evocatively captured a long-gone Sicily in the written form.",

      "reviewBody": "I love samurai movies. Really. I love history movies. I love adventure movies. And I found this movie... &apos;Shogun&apos;s Samurai&apos; I though it was going to be great. There are great actors here. Etsushi Takahashi, for example. He was amazing in &apos;Kill!&apos; and &apos;Akage&apos;. Hiroyuki Sanada is also great. So is Sonny Chiba. I don&apos;t mention Toshiro Mifune because his role here is just a cameo.\n\nWell... The movie was barely watchable. There were lots of problems with it. First, there is the story. It is ridiculously complicated but not compelling enough. Many characters appear but they are not developed at all. Hence I didn&apos;t care about their deaths at all. You know, it is quite sad, actually. You see somebody dying violently. You know you are supposed to feel sorry about him. But you don&apos;t feel anything because this character is a total stranger to you. I felt sorry for not feeling sorry about the characters.\n\nAnd here is the second problem with this movie - it is filled with pointless death. Many people die. Men get killed. Women get killed. Kids get killed. Why? Nobody knows. I am not afraid of a little violence but this was just pointless. The story would be absolutely the same without so many killings. And since you don&apos;t know the characters at all their deaths have absolutely no emotional impact on you. The character&apos;s deaths can only disgust you.\n\nThe next problem with this movie is the fights. You know, that&apos;s what many people are watching samurai films for - sword fighting and action. But... Some of the fights are really nicely choreographed, there are some incredible moves and so on. But... Most of the fights are actually quite messy due to the bad camera work. The camera is shaking constantly and you can&apos;t see anything. It is not like Paul Greengrass directed the movie but still it isn&apos;t what one would expect from a samurai movie.\n\nThe camera work is a bit strange in my opinion. Sometimes you may see amazing landscapes. There are some very nice shots. Yet when it comes to fighting or some dynamic scene you can barely see anything. Yes, it is a problem. A big problem.\n\nOn the other hand there is the acting. It is excellent. Really. A few of the characters are actually well developed and you can care about them. It is mostly because of the actors. They did a really good job with what they are given.\n\nBut that&apos;s not enough because they are not given much. 5/10. And I really wanted to like the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "For a film that mainly revolves around a cast of three to carry the movie, seven stars can seem like seventeen. What makes this film work is the realism. Every choice, every consequence, everything! Like a movie studio trying to emulate the moments before a car accident, then its aftermath.\n\nI&apos;m not one of these reviewers that will take you through the entire plot of the film. Especially in this case. This film&apos;s simplicity works. Three skiers accidentally get forgotten on a ski lift as the resort closes for the week.\n\nThat&apos;s it! Yet, this simple formula works better than any horror movie I have seen in a long, LONG time! This opinion may be a little biased and I&apos;ll tell you why. Personally, I am petrified of open heights. Adam Green&apos;s chosen camera placements are well picked, never once allowing any hints of fiction into the story. That&apos;s the beauty of shooting on location, despite how deadly the location can be.\n\nDeadly, indeed! This movie really got under my skin. Not in anyway gore-filled, like &quot;Hatchet&quot; or its sequel. So for all the gore-hounds out there scanning the reviews for bloody details before watching it, make-up effects enthusiasts won&apos;t be completely disappointed, but it&apos;s no &quot;Hatchtet&quot;. However, Adam Green focuses more on his Actor&apos;s/Actresses&apos; reactions to the horrors within the film. This works! Lord, does it work! I&apos;m a huge GOREHOUND, I welcome squeamish scenes, but the subtle incidents that happen to these characters while exposed to harsh weather works better than a graphic depiction of a chainsaw to the gut! I&apos;m almost ashamed to admit that I had to turn away and groan at what I witnessed on screen! This is from someone who giggled like a girl-scout throughout &quot;A Serbian Film&quot;! &quot;Frozen&quot; works! In all the right ways! My only complaints about the film are the lack of themes. Usually a survival-horror like this contains some smug theme that ties the film together, a topic the film tries to make aware to its audience. Romero does the aforementioned flawlessly, just to provide one example. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and its issue of consumerism. For example, one would assume that being trapped with two other people in a situation like that, the throes of &quot;cabin fever&quot; would naturally work its way into the script. Yet, Adam Green chooses to focus on the reality of the situation his characters find themselves in. As a result, the film remains simple. Leaving the audience with no other thought to ponder upon besides their own feelings of fear. To some, this may be a compliment to the film, to others, a weak link.\n\nThe dialogue is probably the strongest device in the film. Revolving your film around only three characters, the script better be able to keep the dialogue interesting or your audience is going to give up on these characters. Adam Green&apos;s dialogue is just that, interesting. Realizing the situation the characters find themselves in, the conversations that follows feels significant, but above all genuine. Dialogue, outweighs the action, so be prepared for a lot of talking. However, when the action arrives it&apos;s like an avalanche; disastrous, yet magnetic. I was, literally, frozen, couldn&apos;t take my eyes off the screen.\n\nI&apos;ve said enough...\n\nTo reiterate a few points, I have to say, again, this film really shook me. After it was over I had a deeper appreciation for the bed I was watching it in. I also made a vow never, EVER to go skiing.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Aeon Flux&apos; is visually and stylistically dazzling. The CGI and set designs look great and the the futuristic world that is presented is impressive. I haven&apos;t watched the original but having read other comments I would like to watch that. However, regarding this movie, it is the screenplay that is a big letdown. It is very obviously predictable and contrived. It lacks depth. It&apos;s more like just another forgettable Hollywood entertainer. Some scenes seem to be there only to show the special effects (which are great) and stunts as they don&apos;t seem to have any relevance for the main plot.\n\nIn my opinion, the love story is the weakest link. It&apos;s very unconvincing and the &apos;romantic&apos; lead lack chemistry. Furthermore, apart from Theron, McDormand, Okonedo and Postlethwaite, the acting is terrible. Theron looks the part and acts well. She is beautiful but deadly. She does a lot of crawling around and arse kicking but manages to stay in character and looks absolutely sizzling. Okonedo doesn&apos;t have a great role to speak of but she does well. McDormand and Postlethwaite are effective in their small roles. Miller is very bad and Csokas is wooden.\n\nHaving said that, I&apos;d say it&apos;s not a horrendous film. Just something to watch if you don&apos;t have anything better. I really enjoyed the visuals and the style and of course just looking at the beautiful Theron. Other than that, the plot might appeal to the average movie watcher if they want something with no depth, but just an action, sci-fi, romantic flick."

Find Neverland!Marc Forster (&apos;Monster Ball&apos;) has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer&apos;s block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens. Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia&apos;s wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film. The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek. Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant. Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie&apos;s enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don&apos;t miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004"

An older Malcolm, friends and family out of focus in the background, holding a sign that says &quot;I made me&quot;. \n\nThese turn the film from a familiar documentary, into something more artistic and personal.\n\nFar from the definitive film on Malcolm X, but a worthy addition to the exploration of his life, times and legacy.",

It&apos;s set in samurai times, and Gonza is indeed a spearman, but there&apos;s very little by way of action scenes. I was fairly sure it was going to mostly be a drama going in, but I still had my hopes up there&apos;d be a little more fighting. Oh well.\n\nMaybe this is a consequence of watching too many martial arts and samurai movies. I find myself craving that excitement when not all movies with this historical setting are about action. And Gonza the Spearman isn&apos;t terrible as a mostly action less drama either. It&apos;s very well-shot, the plot is interesting for at least the first half, and the acting is solid throughout.\n\nBut even judging it purely as a drama, I think the pacing made me lose interest a little around the halfway mark, and I was a bit zoned out. Things picked up for the ending - that kind of got things back on track. Still, overall, not one of Masahiro Shinoda&apos;s better films, but it&apos;s got a decent number of qualities that his better films have - just not to the same extent.",

Jonah Hill surprised me with his last Netflix series starring alongside Scarlett Johansson so I was curious to see if this film was worth watching.\n\nAnd I have to see it might be close to one of my favourite films. The combination of humour, honest dialogue and a simple story that works really well makes this a great movie.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely not for everyone. The story is slow, there&apos;s no action, it&apos;s mostly talking. But the dialogue is great, a lot of it feels really realistic and there are no cheap cop-outs. Every character feels like a fully fleshed character and it gives every scene weight.\n\nTomei, Hill and Reiley carry their roles really well. They know how to shift from funny to serious and I can&apos;t fault their performances.\n\nSo yeah, I&apos;m definitely glad I watched it and wholeheartedly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "It was around this time that Ireland started offering foreign filmmakers generous tax breaks for making movies in Ireland, which got a number of B movie filmmakers to film there, including Roger Corman. Since he was able to stretch his dollar further, this final entry in the &quot;Bloodfist&quot; series looks a little better than the previous few entries. The movie has some atmosphere, looking dark and moody, and the movie looks somewhat more expensive, with the climax of the movie taking place out in the ocean on a boat, which probably would have been too expensive for Corman if he made the movie stateside. Unfortunately, that&apos;s about all that&apos;s positive to say about the movie. The first part of the movie (set in the U.S.) tries to disguise the Ireland shooting locations, and it&apos;s pretty laughable. The movie is shot with the camera jammed up right at the actors most of the time, which makes it hard to see the surroundings. The action is pretty disappointing, with dull shootouts and unspectacular martial arts sequences (this entry in the series may have the least number of martial arts sequences than any other entry.) Mercifully, the series came to an end at this point."

The movie is fresh, different and remembers me to Rainer Erler&apos;s &quot;Delegation&quot; from the 70s. I&apos;ll give the movie a full thumb up, if you&apos;re interested in movies you must see it, it&apos;s entertaining and suspenseful. I can&apos;t agree with the other review. It&apos;s an independent low budget movie with a very nice idea and a fresh and different realization. The actors are not worth an academy award, but this supports the &quot;documentary style&quot;. But it seems, that for some people the movie works, for others not. Try to see it is my recommendation!",

If she was all about attitude in her previous release &apos;Fashion&apos;(2008), here she is an emotional, loving and expressive lady. Unlike most of the bollywood lead ladies she does know how to act. Her portrayal of the lady who has to deal with the supernatural was the most defining aspect of the movie.\n\nAdhyayan Suman( son of Shekhar Suman) as Yash(Nanditha&apos;s lover boy) does well for a person doing his second film only. And the less that is said about Emraan Hashmi, the better. His role of the painter, who can paint the future(an idea lifted straight from Heroes, but presented in a different manner) was pivotal to the plot and was surprisingly less inclined towards the womanizer roles that he usually does. Jackie Sheroff was highly underused and dwelling into his character will reveal the plot, so less said , the better.\n\nJust like the previous edition, the songs of Raaz 2 are good n hummable. The storyline also offers some respite, from the clich√©d family dramas n love stories. Mohit Suri, the director has done a commendable job, but he has left a few loose ends as well, like for eg: What exactly is the role of the supernatural in painter&apos;s ability to paint the future??.\n\nIn a nutshell, I would say this is one movie that you can enjoy, if u in a mood for some Kangana Raunat special with a horror angle to it!",

But then, I haven&apos;t seen &quot;The General&quot;.  So whether comparison with that film is fair or not, I couldn&apos;t say.\n\nBut what none of your reviewers have pointed to is its structural resemblance to &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;.  ODC is not as original as that wonderful film, but imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it doesn&apos;t do a bad job in terms of wit or entertainment.\n\nSpacey&apos;s casting is a bit bizarre, but works because of that and his geniality lifts the movie.  Only Patrick Malahide takes character truly into the realms of caricature.\n\nOverall ODC is an engaging and enjoyable romp of a film with some nice twists and plenty to enjoy in an undemanding sort of way."

      "name": "Like a Hammer film played for laughs",
      "reviewBody": "It is good to see a John Landis film back on the big screen but i feel he missed a trick or two with this average effort. Firstly, for a film set in Scotland i found it odd that the cast was almost entirely English, betraying the roots of the story (and of the English cast only Tom Wilkinson ,a splendid actor, managed to give a good approximation of a Scots accent).\n\nThis film felt a bit of a homage to the Hammer films, a point made when a certain Hammer Icon makes a cameo appearance (i won&apos;t name the individual as i don&apos;t want to add a spoiler). I am guessing Landis is a Hammer fan and to be fair to him the sets and locations work quite well, giving Edinburgh a spooky feel to it. Both Pegg and Serkis are OK in the lead roles and do their best to sound Irish. It was also good to see Jenny Agutter make a brief appearance too, especially as she is invariably remembered for appearing in Landis&apos;s American Werewolf in London nearly 30 years ago...a nice touch by the director. In fact there seems to be quite a lot of casting British film and TV icons in this film (Ronnie Corbett being another) so i&apos;m guessing that maybe Simon Pegg or Andy Serkis only agreed to do it if certain British childhood icons of theirs were also given parts.\n\nTo be honest the Burke and Hare story has been better done before but this film puts a comedic twist on it that doesn&apos;t always work. The bad language feels unnecessary for a start and the gore isn&apos;t as bad as i thought (certainly not on the levels of the Hostel or Saw films...and not even as graphic as the Final Destination franchise). There are some genuine laughs to be had but usually when Pegg and Serkis are on the screen. The story itself also swings back and forth between gruesome and the unexpected romantic angles that may have been intended to show Burke and Hare as committing their crimes for something other than just greed.\n\nBasically this is a reasonably graphic horror story with heart and morality that has some good laughs but falls flat in a few areas. The cast give it their best shot and whilst it has an old fashioned feel to it in many ways, it is the unnecessary post-modern touches, the inconsistent rate at which the comedy comes and the rather odd casting that jarred me. However do keep an eye out for the odd cameo appearance from some famous actors and comedians.",

Martin Lawrence is a highly successful college basketball coach who has lost touch with the game and his players. A freak accident at one of his games is the last straw as he is banned from coaching the collegiate ranks and then decides to take a job at his old junior high school (being sent a fax by players without consent from administration, go figure!?). Soon the usual sports underdog story takes place with predictable and tiring results. Lawrence has been hit and miss (usually miss) in more adult-oriented flicks, but he looks like he is just trying to make a quick buck here. The kids are totally forgettable and the rest of the cast is unaccomplished and basically have no business in cinematic features. Plays like one of those Disney Network television movies. Hopelessly terrible air ball. 2 stars out of 5."

It&apos;s just an accumulation of absurd dialogues and crazy moments with real good actors that don&apos;t consider themselves too good to act silly (not too silly) although they certainly were unchallenged by the script. The shown sense of humour reminded me slightly of the humour in the fashion of the Coen brothers in terms of pace and surreality, however, less sarcastic, less biting and without cynicism. The characters are rather likable, harmless individuals trying to find peace in a violent surrounding. I would classify this film as a satire about everything the army represents in general and once you&apos;ve realized how stupid the army is you&apos;ll find this an amusing 93 minutes of fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Betrayal centres around Nazi occupied Norway in 1943, with rampant profiteers making a killing from supplying the Nazis with both raw materials and luxuries. Tor Lindblom (Fridtjov S√•heim), is but one of those profiteers, operating out of his popular Oslo nightclub, Club Havana. However, due to his crucial involvement with the construction of an aluminium factory that will greatly boost the Nazis&apos; ailing efforts on the Eastern Front, the British Government has marked Lindblom for death. Double agent Eva (Lene Nystr√∏m) along with Tor&apos;s pilot brother Svein (K√•re Conradi), must take out Tor and get the plans for the factory to British intelligence before their intentions are discovered by the Gestapo.\n\nBased on true events, Betrayal&apos;s story does not translate at all well from the pages of history to an exciting 90 odd minutes of cinema. It&apos;s very obvious from the beginning as to what everyone&apos;s patterns of behaviour will be and what they will all do to achieve their aims. Although there is some scope for creating tension and drama, there needs to be some sort of elevation of the material to make this work effectively. This is where Betrayal really finds it&apos;s major fault; the limp and stodgy direction from helmer Hakon Gunderson.\n\nProceedings take on a very slow pace, with well over two thirds of it&apos;s running time going by before attempts at excitement kick in. Even then, the action is very perfunctory with a distinct lack of tension or thrills. Certainly, the movie is well put together, with a satisfying feeling of authenticity to it&apos;s overall look, as well as being handsomely filmed. However, there is no real zip to the direction and as the story lumbers on, any feeling of involvement in the drama quickly fades. \n\nThe languid nature of the movie also takes it&apos;s toll on Gunderson&apos;s ability to elicit convincing portrayals from some of the cast it seems, with the two brothers Tor and Svein (although both are hopelessly miscast) being more akin to sacks of spuds than crucial and dynamic drivers of the plot. However, while Nystr√∏m&apos;s turn as the heroine is pretty good, the real star of the show is prolific German actor G√∂tz Otto as Kr√ºger, the greedy and corrupt Gestapo officer and business partner of Lindblom. Otto really has screen presence and portrays his role with great relish.\n\nRegrettably, there is not much else to recommend Betrayal. Filmed, framed and shot very well, with a convincing attention to detail, the skill of the crew does come through to the viewer. However the lack of tension, predictability and ponderous pacing make this wartime thriller a rather drab affair indeed.",

Although it exists also in an English version that was made at the same time, both Dietrich and Jannings give better performances in their native language; and, as the sound is rather poor, it is easier to follow in German with the English sub-titles. Jannings was the first actor to win an Academy Award (though not for this film) and his performance as the professor who is lead to ruin by a femme fatale remains one of the memorable film performances. Fans of Dietrich should not miss this film which brought her international success. This is one of those films that only grows with continued viewing. If you were fond of Cabaret, then this is the real Germany between the World Wars. Highly recommended."

Oh, they don&apos;t make shows like that? Thank God. Too bad it slipped through in the theatres.\n\nPulse 3 is like watching Gossip Girl put in a blender with The Matrix and Saw, except it&apos;s infinitely more painful. I went between the emotions of: boredom, disgust, hatred and checking to make sure I hadn&apos;t nodded off. Yes I know that&apos;s not an emotion, but it happened to me repeatedly during this tragedy so I thought it was worth a mention. What kind of movie provides you with a number of camera angles of a woman blowing her head off with a shotgun in grisly detail? THIS ONE!!! I&apos;d like to think that scene served some kind of purpose, but I&apos;ll leave it at that. I&apos;d also like to think that one&apos;s imagination serves some sort of purpose, but this film won&apos;t let me have it. The film seemed to be going somewhere, until the girl runs away, then it&apos;s just a scantily-clad drama queen screaming at the top of her lungs because her internet boyfriend won&apos;t txt her back. After about the half-hour mark you may as well shut it off. That&apos;s where the philosophy turns into fluff. A huge build-up to nothing. Don&apos;t waste your time.",

It still has a great message for all of us no matter where we live and you just get swept away by the wonderful score. The dance routines are charming and the interiors quite exquisite. Nancy Kwan has never looked lovelier as Linda Loo and Jack Soo is always a delight.Juanita Hall brings her great presence to the role of Madame Liang and Miyoshi Umeki and James Shigeta are two fine performers. Patrick Adriarte dances with great verve. A great night&apos;s viewing for all!"

Clint wisely plays straight man to Clyde, who provides the funniest moments, when not befriending William Smith (&quot;Big Bill&quot; Smith from the old biker movies. Go look it up.), then engaging in a bare-knuckle fight with him later on.\n\nEveryone fares better in this movie, in fact. Sondra Locke is far more graceful, Geoffrey Lewis gets more laughs, even Ruth Gordon is seen as the next Bo Derek (bless her heart).\n\nAnd if the Black Widows aren&apos;t more menacing this time around, well... that&apos;s kind of hard to do when you&apos;re wearing fake wigs and have penciled-in facial hair.\n\nI&apos;ve seen this movie so many times myself, that I have nearly the entire screenplay committed to memory. What more indelible impression could a filmmaker want to make than that?",

      "reviewBody": "Having been a big fan of Hong-kong fantasy action movies(chinese ghost story 1,2,3..and etc..) especially I completely captivated by this one. When I first saw this movie, I was only 14. this movie was brought a great popularity and main stars Brigitte Lin and Jet li became household name in here, South Korea. I still remember when these two stars visited here to promote, Brigitte Lin had to escaped from being run over by her fans in Korea.\n\nShe plays &quot;Asia the invincible&quot; who&apos;s gave up his manly symbol to become the best sword man. Jet li plays another great sword man who&apos;s pure, sincere to his belief. On the way to find his men, came across &quot;Asia the invincible&quot; several times. although &quot;Asia the invincible&quot; is a villain who&apos;s so brutal when he eliminates his enemy, starts attracted to Jet li. and Jet li does too.\n\nBut the development relationship between Jet li and &quot;Asia the invincible&quot; can hardly describe. actually both of them are men. It can be called &quot;Homosexual interest&quot;. but it doesn&apos;t a big deal. In fact I think this made this movie more unique, and sensual, joyful to watch.\n\nStriking, powerful performance by Brigitte. she had been my idol for years. it&apos;s a really pity that she had disappear from the screen after getting married. it&apos;s a role really hard to play. but she&apos;s charismatic enough to command the whole movie. her last scene still haunting me. can&apos;t believe she was almost 40 when she did shoot this one.\n\nThe early Jet li so cute, and I really admire his martial arts skills( although most of his martial arts here are computer-generated or wire actions ) I can&apos;t count how many times I&apos;ve seen this movie. action sequences so beautiful and stunning. See this movie. it will be unusual experience!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Jaffa, an Israeli film whose title refers to a part of Tel Aviv, is an excellent and moving drama. I wish movies like this got more press and had more fame. The story is sad, realistic and compelling.\n\nThe movie begins in the family owned garage of an Israeli family, where father, son Meir, and daughter Mali, work alongside a young Palestinian named Toufik. Meir is not the model son- rebellious, angry, ungrateful and disrespectful towards his parents and everybody else, he steals the attention from his quiet younger sister. No one suspects that she is having a love affair with Toufik and that they are secretly planning on getting married.\n\nReligious and other tensions start building between the two young men, Meir and Toufik, and the outcome is shocking and devastating. Mali makes an extremely difficult sacrifice, depriving herself of a normal life by keeping hidden a truth which only she knows.\n\nAll of the actors are magnificent. The father is particularly memorable, always kind, trying at times to be a little bit stern, understanding of everyone throughout the film until his final, harsh condemnation. The ending is extremely powerful- completely unexpected and expected at the same time. Mali finally makes a choice for herself and we are left hoping that her life will be a happy one.\n\nThis film brought me to tears on several occasions. I watched it without Fabio as I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect and now highly recommend it to him and all of my readers.\n\nMy rating: 9/10 Please visit http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com and become a follower to read more reviews!",

The backdrop is the standard post-apocalyptic mess that humanity has left itself in after &quot;who knows what.&quot;  The juggers travel town-to-town in search of food and entertainment, in return for providing matches against the local teams.\n\nThe script is well executed and one is led to believe this sport would have a wide following in the aftermath, almost like a team sport of UFC of the future.  The characters are superb and Hauer and Chen really give them life.  Rutger needs to go back to this flick and see what he has lost! I really cared about this band of juggers and it seemed like everyone in the ensemble was on the same page. The Blood Of Heroes is a tremendous miss in the anals of great sci-fi films.  Please go rent it."

Broadly funny, and a more than a bit surreal, the tale of down-and-out gambler Mitchum &apos;hired&apos; to travel to a remote Mexican resort to provide a &apos;body&apos; so that a notorious gangster (Raymond Burr, sleekly villainous) can feign his death and return to the U.S., is action-packed, and has been described as &quot;Bogie and Bacall on Steroids&apos;!\n\nA great deal of the success of the John Farrow-directed film is due to the inspired casting of Vincent Price as a ham actor who gets to &apos;live out&apos; his celluloid life, aiding Mitchum. Price quotes Shakespeare, critiques his performance, and is amazed by his own heroics, and he has never been funnier, on screen.\n\nAn excellent supporting cast, including Tim Holt, Charles McGraw, Marjorie Reynolds, Paul Frees (the famous Hollywood &apos;voice&apos; actor, actually seen, for a change), and Jim Backus contribute to the on screen mayhem, and Russell sings &quot;Five Little Miles From San Berdoo&quot;, one of her more memorable 50s numbers.\n\nFrom the opening scene, as Burr, exiled in Italy, listens to a short-wave radio broadcast of his successful career as an American crime kingpin (&quot;Where is my money?&quot; he demands, as an estimate of his revenue is quoted), to the brawling climax with Mitchum, aboard his yacht, as Price attempts a rescue, HIS KIND OF WOMAN is pure escapism, at it&apos;s best.\n\nHere&apos;s hoping that a DVD edition may soon be released!"

      "reviewBody": "Burt Lancaster usually played parts with a lot of depth to them, especially after From Here to Eternity. In fact other than Vengeance Valley, the only other film where he played a totally upright hero is Gunfight at the OK Corral.\n\nHe&apos;s the orphan kid that gets taken in by rancher Ray Collins who grows up and becomes foreman and companion to Robert Walker, Collins&apos;s real son. Walker is a spoiled kid and Lancaster is constantly cleaning up after him. Some of the same plot elements were used later in Man From Laramie and The Big Country. \n\nWalker is both coming home to his wife,Joanne Dru and another girl he&apos;s fathered a kid with, Sally Forrest. Lancaster is caught taking hush money over to Forrest by her no-account brothers, John Ireland and Hugh O&apos;Brian. They come to the conclusion that Lancaster has done the deed. That&apos;s where the action starts.\n\nGood western with some adult themes. Cattle drive scenes are tough and gritty, they don&apos;t have the epic quality of Red River, but are nicely done. The players all give a good account of themselves.",

The film covers the years that follow as the father refuses to ever give up on his daughter, no matter what she has done, and what his loyalty costs him. \n\nThis could have been sappy or melodramatic, but the acting is all beautifully understated and real, and the background of the rise of fascism and the ravages of WWII in Italy gives a larger context to the questions of guilt, innocence, forgiveness and loyalty.\n\nA quiet film, but a strikingly memorable one.",

      "reviewBody": "Must had cried for a thousand miles. Watching a movie on a 6&quot; screen trapped in a coach seat at 30,000 ft high is usually a diversion not a pleasurable entertainment. But strangely enough, this simple 3 hankie movie is both engaging and moving.\n\nA railway man works at the end of a desolated railway line, at the end of his career, at the end of his life. Nothing much happens. He does his job at the one man station faithfully. He greets the old familiar commuters with the station name, shovels snow off the platform, sends the train off with a ritualistic check list. He did this almost all his life with the same mechanical precision. He had a family once. His daughter died at a very young age and more recently his wife died.\n\nThe lonely widower had a few visitors on New Year Eve. And the news were not feastive. The little town, with the younger population migrating to bigger places, would probably die of old age. The rail line, facing declining traffic and increasing loss, will be closed. And he would have to vacate the station which was also his home for most of his life.\n\nThe director, Yasuo Furuhata, handles the story with sensitivity and humility. The occasional high camera or wide angle shots only accentuates the isolation. Cutting is excellent. Scenes are allowed to sustain poignancy without allowing distraction. Quick cuts are used to enforce the ritual routine with precision. The bare story line &amp; minimal dialogue was not a handicap. The use of flashbacks in fact creates beautiful characterisation without unnecessary ornamentation. The old method of using colour tone to delineate time events was very effective here. In one particular scene shot from a static camera position flowed with a continuous action shifted over time just by the use of colour. Seamless, masterly.\n\nHow did veteran lead Ken Takakura win so much empathy for his part is really a mystery. No strut, quiet body and very little facial expression. Yet he involves us in the internal conflicts of the character. When he said &quot;no regrets&quot; over the choices he had made in his career, the price he had to pay and the sadness he felt is palpable.\n\nDon&apos;t believe a word I say. Just go watch the movie.",

It is one of those movies that is so bad it&apos;s good.\n\nA scientist experimenting with time travel on a remote island in the Everglades manages to bring back a mutated woman from 5200 AD! She starts killing people and after replacing her face with that of a nurse she killed, she heads back to the future.\n\nThe cast includes Ward Costello, Joyce Holden, Frederic Downs and Salome Jens as the woman from the future. I&apos;ve never heard of any of these.\n\nDespite the very low budget, I rather enjoyed watching Terror From the Year 5000 and taped it when it came on BBC1 during the early hours some years ago. Luckily, I still have it on video.\n\nRating: 2 stars out of 5.",

      "name": "Routine Light Thriller with Charismatic Young Actress",
      "reviewBody": "In some of her early films, such as &apos;Tiger Bay&apos; or &apos;Whistle Down the Wind&apos;, Hayley Mills revealed herself to be one of Britain&apos;s most remarkable child actresses, but as an adult her films were generally unremarkable. The light family films she made in her teenage years for Disney and others can be seen as marking a stage in her decline to the ordinary from the extraordinary. Indeed, they were possibly a cause of that decline; had she been given more demanding roles during this period she might have matured into a bigger adult star. The studios&apos; determination to fit her into the role of Teenage Virgin Queen occupied a few years earlier by Sandra Dee might also have made it more difficult for the public to accept her as an adult woman.\n\n&apos;The Moonspinners&apos; is a typical offering from her Disney period. The teenage Nikky Ferris arrives for a holiday in Crete with her aunt, a musicologist who wants to make recordings of Cretan folk-music. The owner of their hotel, however, is unwelcoming and his behaviour soon arises Nikky&apos;s suspicions that he is involved in some criminal enterprise. Nikky meets and befriends a young Englishman, Mark, and the two soon find themselves involved in a search to recover some stolen jewels. \n\nSeveral other reviewers compare this film to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. The film is a mixture of romantic comedy and thriller, although I felt that the romance and comedy elements predominate over the suspense elements to a greater extent than they ever do in Hitchcock, even in his lighter films. The scene where Nikki and Mark are rescued from the windmill, however, did strike me as very Hitchcockian; I wondered if it was intended as deliberate homage to the similar scene involving Joel McCrae in &apos;Foreign Correspondent&apos;. \n\nMy general impression of the film was that it was, despite some attractive location photography, a fairly routine light thriller. Peter McEnery, as Mark, makes an uncharismatic leading man, and the principal baddies (Eli Wallach as suspicious, surly foreigner and John Le Mesurier as smooth but hypocritical English gentleman) are drawn straight from the Official Hollywood Scriptwriter&apos;s Guide to Stock Villainous Characters. There is an amusing cameo from Sheila Hancock as Le Mesurier&apos;s alcoholic wife, but the best thing about the film is the presence of Hayley herself. She reminded me of Audrey Hepburn whose charisma and presence frequently enabled her to make memorable what would otherwise have been very ordinary thrillers or romantic comedies. Hayley was, of course, considerably younger than Audrey and (in my view) less classically beautiful, but shared with her the ability to carry a film through charm and charisma. &apos;The Moonspinners&apos; is not in the same league as Hayley&apos;s best films, but it is worth watching for a chance to see this fine young actress. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "In the Eighteenth Century in France, a few years before the French Revolution, the Countess de Linieres (Katherine Emmet) asks her minion to deliver her baby daughter Louise to an orphanage to protect her. However he leaves the baby on the stairs of a church. A peasant finds Louise and brings her home to his wife and they find a necklace with her name and money in the basket. They raise Louise with their daughter Henriette as sisters, but years later there is a plague and they die and Louise becomes blind. Louise Girard (Dorothy Gish) is totally dependent on Henriette Girard (Lillian Gish) and they travel to Paris expecting to find the cure of Louise&apos;s blindness. The rogue Marquis de Praille (Morgan Wallace) sees Henriette and becomes fascinated with her virginal beauty. He asks his men to abduct Henriette and brings her to his party. Louise is left alone in Paris and the scoundrel Mother Frochard (Lucille La Verne) forces Louise to beg on the streets for her. Meanwhile the noble aristocrat Chevalier de Vaudrey (Joseph Schildkraut) saves Henriette and they fall in love with each other. But Henriette explains that she had promised Louise that she would not marry until Louise could look upon her husband to approve him. Meanwhile Danton (Monte Blue), who is saved by Henriette, and Robespierre (Sidney Herbert) are plotting the French Revolution that explodes on the streets keeping the sisters apart.\n\n&quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; is another magnificent epic by D. W. Griffith and his last success. The film impresses in many aspects, such as the screenplay, the set locations and fantastic camera work, with impressive angles considering the size of the cameras and the technology in the early Twentieth Century. The plot is a combination of heavy drama, romance and action and sensitive viewers will certainly need a handkerchief to see the touching scenes of the sisters set apart. The suspenseful conclusion, with Danton and his men trying to deliver the pardon of Henriette and Chevalier de Vaudrey, is suspenseful and thrilling. The lovely Lilian Gish is another attraction with a wonderful performance. Last but not the least, &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; is a mandatory film for any cinema lover. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;√ìrf√£s da Tempestade&quot; (&quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot;)",

Non of the actors put some character-deepness into his / her role. -- Special effects are poor (even considering that it&apos;s a low budget movie). Main reason is that everything is so fast and cheesy, that you can&apos;t enjoy a single action scene.... you basically have to make up yourself AFTER the scene, what exactly happened in that one. -- Soundtrack is only consisting of standard high frequency horror noise... which was a pain in the ass... -- Balance between the volume of speak / music is bad. Takes a lot of concentration to listen to those (mostly simple and ridiculous) dialogs. Subtitles are recommended... --Most importantly: The zombies in this movie are NOT slow, scary and relentless. They&apos;re the opposite, which is another big contra."

      "reviewBody": "Roman Polanski&apos;s film Tess, (1979) adaptation of Thomas Hardy famous novel of the 19th century &quot;Tess of the D&apos;Urbervilles&quot; , won many prestigious awards, including three Oscars of six nominations and every award for Best Cinematography it was nominated for. If any film deserves recognition for its beautiful, lyrical, sensual yet melancholic and poetic visual presentation, &quot;Tess&quot; is it. The movie might be Roman Polanski&apos;s finest achievement, and this statement comes from a viewer who is in love with all Polanski&apos;s films starting with his debut &quot;Knife in the Water&quot;. &quot;Tess&quot; is one of the best adaptations of the classic novel I&apos;ve seen and it lives, breathes and moves freely. It never rushes to tell its long story but tells it with rare finesse, compassion, and love for the heroine, a gentle creature who had been insulted, humiliated, and ultimately destroyed.\n\nThe success of the movie starts with the choice of the actress for the title role. Tess as played by 20 years old Nasstassia Kisnki is beautiful, sensual, shy and full of life and hope for love. The life of Tess unfolds in front of us from her teenage years as an innocent country girl until the powerfully tragic final scene at the magnificent Stonehenge. The film is almost three hours long but I never was bored, on the contrary, I felt compassion for the girl and anger toward the men that used and corrupted her, ruined her hopes for love and happiness, and toward the society that mercifully discarded of her. Tess is one of the best movies I&apos;ve seen. It is stunning, subtle, emotional, tragic, and unforgettable.",

There are three differences: the characters are Korean; the scene is college; and the Third Act is Overwrought Melodrama that completely undermines all the gross out gags of the first hour.\n\nAnyone familiar with Asian films will not be all that surprised by the movie&apos;s sudden shift in themes. Tackling a serious topic like abortion in a movie where characters masturbates at just about EVERY given opportunity??? It provides an odd dichotomy, to be sure.\n\nStill, the film is reasonably funny enough, even if all of its gags are telegraphed about 10 minutes beforehand.\n\n6 out of 10\n\n(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie)",

And superstar status for Tom Hardy.\n\nWarrior, though a work of fiction, plays out like a true story; two brothers at odds with each other and their father, in the town of Pittsburgh, who resort to prize fighting, one for the money, the other to prove himself a man.",

      "name": "Roy Rogers&apos; First Lead in a Movie",
      "reviewBody": "He was the top money-making Western film star in the 1940s and early 1950s. Yet if it weren&apos;t for a disgruntled Gene Autry, Leonard Slye would have never been a major movie actor. His major Hollywood debut in April 1938&apos;s &quot;Under Western Stars&quot; proved so successful that Slye, otherwise known as Roy Rogers, capitalized on his first lead movie appearance to create a gigantic empire in film, records and television.\n\nGene Autry discovered his movies for his employer, Republic Pictures, were reaping profits almost ten times what the pictures were costing to produce. Autry felt he was worth a lot more than the studio was paying him. He also was disgruntled by the number of personal appearances Republic was forcing him to make. He went on a personal strike when it came time to appear in his next movie, &quot;Under Western Stars.&quot; As member of the Sons of the Pioneers, Slye was seen earlier briefly singing and yodeling in a number of films beginning in 1935. Republic studio executives were so impressed by the looks and voice of Slye they gave him the lead in &quot;Under Western Stars.&quot; Slye beat out a number of country singers who were considered for the role of a cowboy who runs for United States Congress on the platform of water rights for the ranchers and farmers living in his district. Republic recognized the name Leonard Slye wasn&apos;t exactly suited for an actor, so the studio gave him the Western sounding first name Roy. Linking him to the late Will Rogers, it added Rogers as his last name.\n\n&quot;This is Roy Rogers&apos; first starring role, but you would never know it,&quot; notes film reviewer Jessica Pickens. &quot;He does well in the role and is also adorable.&quot; &quot;Under Western Stars&quot; was a departure to regular Westerns. Set in the contemporary West where the region is suffering from a severe drought, the film deals with the ranchers&apos; attempts to extract water from a nearly full reservoir. The lake is under control of an East Coast company whose owners refuse to release its precious commodity. Roy sides with the ranchers, and in a contentious election, wins the seat where he makes his case before the United States Congress.\n\n&quot;Under Western Stars&quot; was also horse companion &apos;Trigger&apos;s&apos; first movie under Roy&apos;s saddle. The four-year-old Golden Palomino stallion, originally named Golden Cloud, was selected by Rogers specifically for this movie. This wasn&apos;t Golden Cloud&apos;s first movie appearance: he was Olivia de Havilland&apos;s horse in 1938&apos;s &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood.&quot; When Roy first rode Golden Cloud, he loved how the horse reacted quickly to his reins. &quot;He could turn on a dime and give you some change&quot; Roy said fondly, buying him for $2,500, and renamed him Trigger.\n\nAs a son of a shoe factory worker, Roy Rogers was born in Cincinnati and lived in a tenement apartment later torn down to make way for Riverfront Stadium. Rogers humorously noted he was born where second base stood. His family relocated to Lucasville, Ohio, where he learned to yodel so he could communicate with his brothers at a distance on the farm where they lived. Roy learned to ride horses there, and as a hobby sang and played guitar. Working odd jobs after dropping out of high school, Rogers moved with his family to southern California where he latched on to several country music groups, including the Sons of the Pioneers. The Sons were so popular they sang on a nationwide syndicated radio show. A recording contract led to several film appearances, where Roy and his singing mates strummed, sang and yodeled.\n\nIn &quot;Under the Western Stars,&quot; Rogers sang several songs, including the Johnny Marvin tune &quot;Dust,&quot; nominated for the Academy Awards&apos; Best Song. Meanwhile Gene Autry&apos;s personal strike didn&apos;t last long. He and Republic Pictures soon settled their disagreements out of court, and the studio handed its star a more lucrative new contract.",

They are supposed to take a honeymoon cruise to Europe but his nearly-deaf boss Judge Doolittle implies taking a big case away from him. Doolittle promotes co-worker Carter as partner over him. The couple has a boy and they struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThe pairing of Stewart and Lombard is very promising. In the end, this lacks a structure for the drama. It&apos;s more like a run-on sentence of a family drama. It also doesn&apos;t help to be missing the courtship. It needs a meet-cute and a good relationship progression. It feels like a laundry list of melodramas rather than a good flowing plot. Their difficult marriage leaves any chemistry with the leads in a precarious position. At its core, I find it hard to feel the love sometimes. Their individual screen presence is undeniable but this movie fails to capitalize on them.",

      "reviewBody": "German director Ernst Hofbauer, along with his sometimes collaborator Walter Boos and producer Wolf Hartwig, created the 70&apos;s &quot;sex-report&quot; films, fake docudramas about the exploits of sexy schoolgirls and horny housewives (all played by the same group of German and Scandinavian actresses who weren&apos;t particularly believable as either). Well, here Hofbauer tackles the subject of &quot;sex at the office&quot;, and while this will never make it as one of those sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace training videos, it&apos;s certainly a lot more fun. The frame story involves a male boss who is caught en flagrante with a female underling by the the cleaning staff. Although the actress (Karin Field from &quot;The Mad Butcher&quot;) looks nearly 30, her character is actually 18, yet (in the confused English audio version) also &quot;underage&quot;. So while the legal magistrates decide the man&apos;s fate, two reporters decide to go out and &quot;research&quot; other stories about illicit office sex.\n\nMost of the stories are beyond ridiculous, but they&apos;re sometimes pretty sexy. One poor guy is the sole male supervisor in an office of sex-mad foreign women. An Italian girl and a Greek girl get in a catfight over him (and one of them uses an interesting move where she pulls down her opponent&apos;s panties and spanks her). Anyway, to the victor eventually goes the spoils. Then a female fashion boss, who usually contents herself with lesbian couplings (and triplings), falls in love with an (apparently) straight man. It all goes awry, and she attempts suicide, but winds up happily in the arms of her fat male psychologist (lucky her). Still, this story is more entertaining than &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. Then there&apos;s an actual BELIEVABLE story of a boss sexually harassing a young female employee (how&apos;d that one get in here?). Then a &quot;perverted&quot; husband and wife sexually abuse a foreign maid, but turnabout is fair play as the husband receives a bare-ass whipping from two burly foreign garbage men?! And the goofy-looking &quot;sex-report&quot; regular Michael Schreiner also shows up at one point--once again, he has hooked with an improbably attractive fraulein, but once again it all goes horribly wrong. . .\n\nThe women are typically attractive, but the story-telling is quite a bit lazier than usual. There&apos;s also a hilarious amount of self-promotion here with posters from Hofbauer&apos;s more well-known &quot;schuldmachen-report&quot; films often seen in the background. Those are generally better than this one, but if you&apos;re really into office sex, this just might be for you."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;It&apos;s a big world out there; it&apos;s messy, chaotic and it&apos;s never what you&apos;d expect&quot;, Carter (Adam Brody) tells Lucy (Kristen Stewart) in a crucial moment of &quot;In the land of women&quot;. Writer/director Jon Kasdan&apos;s first film is a fresh take on what I like to call &apos;turning points&apos;, and it can be described with the phrase quoted above, except for the chaotic part.\n\nIt would be fair to reassure the unexpected part, because the film was definitely (and is, if you care watching the trailer) incorrectly publicized, making the viewer believe something that&apos;s clearly not there. There&apos;s a big chance that teenager fans of Adam Brody (Seth Cohen, from the series &quot;The O.C.&quot;) end up disappointed by the movie, which contains a little girl that&apos;s precocious in her way of seeing life, a girl who doesn&apos;t know what she wants and a mother who&apos;s dealing with a big issue. \n\nWhen Carter comes into the life of these women, he&apos;s also going through a difficult personal moment; he&apos;s just broken up with his girlfriend and has to get over her. A writer of soft porn movie screenplays (how&apos;s that for original?), Carter decides to visit his grandmother (a hilarious Olympia Dukakis) and, while he takes care of her, probably figure out what to do with his life and maybe write what he always wanted to and never could. And there he meets Lucy and her mother Sarah (Meg Ryan in top form), and every &apos;turning point&apos; gets mixed up. \n\nWhat goes on between Carter and the &apos;women&apos; of the title may adjust to the &quot;messy&quot; part of the beginning: a sort of triangle will start taking shape, but gladly this is not your everyday triangle of love and discussions. It&apos;s a triangle of mutual enrichment, where every character learns at least something from the other. \n\nProbably if you fully analyze the situations they&apos;re going through, only one of them is logically preoccupying, but the fact is that none of these characters in a position where giving up is an option. Kasdan tries, with a human and perceptive script, to present solutions and hope to these situations. With a peaceful camera, he puts quiet conversations above everything else and that&apos;s the key of his recommendable movie&apos;s success. That doesn&apos;t mean that the rest doesn&apos;t help though. \n\nThere&apos;s something about &quot;In the land of women&quot; that&apos;s questionable but also gratifying and is that these &apos;turning points&apos;, while not so defining and irremediable, are presented as the ultimate moments of life; as the most important decisions these characters need to take. The moving score by Stephen Trask; Adam Brody&apos;s charismatic portrayal, still attached to the &apos;Cohen Factor&apos;; and the perfect performance by Kristen Stewart, with all the expressions and insecurities of an adolescent, make some scenes and conversations more crucial than they may actually be. \n\nYou pay attention to those conversations, and to a couple of movie references, and to those moments when we&apos;re expecting a character to say something. Here, Kasdan evades all the common places and the clich√©s and those phrases we&apos;re always waiting to hear. That always has to be something good.",

It&apos;s a shame that MGM hung this movie out to dry in the theaters but I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s because they didn&apos;t know how to market it. You see: PATHOLOGY is kind of immoral, mean spirited, filled with sex, and features some great medical based gore ¬ñ my (and I&apos;m assuming your) kind of movie ¬ñ but certainly not an easy sell. I guess at it&apos;s core PATHOLOGY is a fun, silly, popcorn movie but it&apos;s executed so well that it rises above the rest of the trash in the theater right now (4.20.08). So check this movie out ¬ñ I think you (and you) will like it.",

      "reviewBody": "Initially, I stayed away from this movie as it received merciless reviews. The fact that Julia Roberts was in it also was another obstacle. Yet as other reviewers have mentioned, she actually gives a good performance. John Malkovich is excellent as the tormented Jekyll/Hyde character.\n\nThe cinematography and moods are haunting. One feels they are actually re-living the Victorian era, where the servants woke up at 4AM to complete their drudgery. The kitchen conjures up the stark realities of survival, the eel that is chopped up for dinner (while alive) Mary Reilly turns white as a sheet as she sees the animal die. I actually began to appreciate Ms. Roberts&apos; performances more after this film (also in films like &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, she projects a certain believability; is not just a physical presence). At one point, there is a most effective scene wherein Roberts must see to her mother&apos;s burial, and goes to the tenement to make arrangements. The landlord has placed her mother&apos;s body in a damp cellar closet, saying she is &quot;most comfortable&quot; as he hands her one shilling, the only money Roberts will inherit. Roberts then says; ...&quot;√§ poor wage for a lifetime of drudgery&quot;... We are reminded of the workhouses of Dickens, and the rigid class structures which she must survive...\n\nWhile the dialect is at times choppy, she is believable as an Irish maid; and the supporting cast also lends credence to this story. Malkovich varies his performance between Jekyll/Hyde, and it is effective and visceral.\n\nIf you initially avoided this film, I would highly recommend seeing it now. The atmosphere and music are haunting and sad. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who&apos;s ever written off Marilyn Monroe as &quot;just&quot; a dumb blonde are directed to this film immediately. Yes, at first glance, Lorelei Lee is a brainless piece of fluff, given to such malapropisms as &quot;Pardon me, please, is this the boat to Europe, France?&quot; But upon closer inspection, this girl is no dummy. Rather remarkably for the chauvinist times, Lorelei and Dorothy (played by the incredibly underrated Jane Russell) do things on their own terms, and when Lorelei &quot;plays dumb,&quot; it&apos;s because she knows that&apos;s what men expect--and she uses it to her advantage. But enough of the heavy analysing; above all, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; is FUN! It&apos;s clearly of the Fox, rather than the MGM, school of musicals--MGM made the &quot;art&quot; musicals (&quot;An American in Paris,&quot; &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot;), while Fox made the &quot;vulgar&quot; ones (&quot;There&apos;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;). From the opening number (&quot;Two Little Girls from Little Rock&quot;), we know we&apos;re in for a visually opulent, noveau riche zircon of entertainment--witness the gaudy black, red and blue color scheme. Lorelei and Dorothy&apos;s costumes are at the extreme end of 50&apos;s fashion; designer Travilla will never go down as a contemporary of Dior or Balenciaga, but as a precursor to Bob Mackie. And yet, this is still a very funny (and essentially very warm) movie. There are few screen friendships as believable and as lovable as Lorelei and Dorothy&apos;s--maybe only Lucy and Ethel&apos;s on the small screen really surpasses it. &quot;Let&apos;s get this straight,&quot; Dorothy warns, &quot;nobody ever talks about Lorelei except ME.&quot; And Lorelei returns the compliment: &quot;Dorothy is the best, loyalest friend a girl could ever have.&quot; Pretty heartwarming stuff! In a nutshell, Lorelei and Dorothy are nightclub entertainers who head for Paris when Lorelei&apos;s romance with millionaire Mr. Esmond (Tommy Noonan) flounders due to his father&apos;s interference. Shipboard, Dorothy is romanced by Malone (Elliot Reid), who, unbeknowst to the girls, is a private detective hired by Esmond to keep an eye out for potential scandal. Meanwhile, Lorelei meets Lord Beekman, aka &quot;Piggy&quot; (Charles Coburn), probably the dirtiest dirty old man in the history of film. Piggy just happens to own the 2nd largest diamond mine in South Africa, and soon enough, Lorelei is coveting the gorgeous diamond tiara owned by Piggy&apos;s wife, Lady Beekman (Norma Varden). Various mixups and mayhem ensues, with Lorelei and Dorothy eventually stranded in Paris. And that&apos;s where Marilyn Monroe gives her penultimate performance: the legendary &quot;Diamonds are a Girl&apos;s Best Friend&quot; sequence. Even today, after scores of parodies and tributes, this number captivates. Not since Rita Hayworth&apos;s &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot; in &quot;Gilda&quot; was there such an intoxicatingly sexy marriage between star, song and persona. In this number, Marilyn is by turns playful, alluring, seductive and charming, but NEVER conniving or hard-edged. And therein lies her appeal: even when proclaiming &quot;I prefer a man who lives and gives expensive jewels!&quot;, Marilyn is never anything less than adorable. She&apos;s not a gum-snapping, man-eating golddigger; she wants pretty things, and knows how to get them--but not at the expense of being nice. She may peruse passenger lists with single-minded focus (&quot;Any man with &apos;...and valet&apos; after his name is definitely worthwhile&quot;), but she&apos;s still a likable character WITH a motivation behind her actions--which always remain entirely innocent. Special note must be made here, too, of Jane Russell&apos;s contributions to this film (not the least of which is her seen-to-be-believed solo, &quot;Ain&apos;t There Anyone Here for Love,&quot; in which she&apos;s surrounded by posterior-pumping beefcake). It would&apos;ve been very easy for Russell to either throw the film entirely to Monroe, or push too hard for her own spotlight at the expense of onscreen warmth and camraederie. Wisely, Russell does neither. She simply turns in a snappy, effortless comic performance that more than holds its own, and projects a marvelous sense of sisterhood in her scenes with Monroe. This is a small comic, musical gem; the sum is greater than its parts (the songs themselves are weak; the comedy is sometimes obvious), but you cannot deny its sheer entertainment value. This is a perfect example of star power (Monroe&apos;s AND Russell&apos;s) turning a rhinestone into a diamond."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most brilliantly funny movies in the history of film. It displays humor that is so complex, and it&apos;s so unbelievably fall-on-the-floor-until-you-can-no-longer-breathe-and-your- friends-have-to-dial-9-1-1-but-they-can&apos;t-because-they can&apos;t-breathe-either-and-you-all-end-up-suffocating-funny that it should not be missed. What&apos;s almost as funny are some of the other reviews on this site. People actually admitting to being scared by this unintended laugh fest. The soundtrack is the stuff Academy Award-winning scores are made of. I want to turn that kid who played Michael into a cult hero. I know he&apos;s no longer living because I think he had that aging disease. I love the 40 year-old man who dubbed Michael&apos;s voice with that soprano-mock-child voice. Paper machet zombies always liven up a film that wears it&apos;s no-budget aesthetics proudly on it&apos;s sleave. What may be the funniest thing of all is that I own this movie(not the rights, just the video, although I could probably afford the rights.) The blurb on the box says that it&apos;s about a &quot;group of jet-setters and a mysterious professor that we don&apos;t see too much of.&quot; Priceless. This is a rare movie to find at rental stores, but if you look hard enough, it may pop up and your searching efforts will not go unrewarded when you find it. You can trust me on this one. To quote the professor at the beginning, &quot;I&apos;m your friend.&quot;"

The ghosts were unusual enough to be memorable and there was not a lot of familiarity to the plot. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects. Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children(if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. I call it a near miss which is as good as most horror fils can aspire to.",

Indian haters, of course, stir up the usual sort of trouble and Stewart&apos;s bride becomes a victim with all the consequent poignancy for which the film is best remembered¬Ö\n\nThe over-wise Chandler counsels him that he must learn to live with his whiteness just as his new friends must contend with their own place in the cosmic scheme of things¬Ö Cochise has words of stark consolation for Stewart: &quot;As I bear the murder of my people, so you will bear the murder of your wife.&quot; \n\nThe most interesting aspect of &quot; Broken Arrow&quot; is not the interracial romance between Stewart and Paget, but Stewart&apos;s relationship with Chandler&apos;s Cochise¬Ö There is intra-character complexity here, as Chandler struggles to overcome his disturb of all whites, and Stewart attempts to comprehend the different philosophy and cultural of the Indians¬Ö \n\nJeff Chandler was quite apt and professional¬Ö He was so believable in the role of the Apache chief Cochise that he was to essay it again in George Sherman&apos;s &quot;The Battle at Apache Pass&quot; in 1952¬Ö Chandler&apos;s facial bone structure lent itself to noble, incisive Indian profiles, and unlike other Caucasian actors he did not look out of place¬Ö He was even nominated for Best Supporting Actor at that year&apos;s Oscars",

Buoyed by strong performances, Dream is not at all what you&apos;d expect it would be. Much to my surprise, it is actually a smart, witty, intelligent and touching look at old age and adolecence by way of new age philosophy. Corey Feldman gives one of his best performances, and no, that&apos;s not a joke, and Haim is never better anywhere than he is in his small role as the oddball best friend Dinger. Obviously it didn&apos;t hurt to have a three time Oscar nominee like the late, great Jason Robards on board. This movie really does have something for everyone, and I&apos;m being a hundred percent serious. So many &quot;oh so serious&quot; types like to bash movies like this, but I&apos;m a writer, and I love good, interesting movies, and I truly see this as one of them. What a terrific, quirky little gem produced by the Two Coreys before midnight, January 1st, 1990 when their careers suddenly spiralled down the toilet. Funny, touching, and utterly enjoyable.",

York is another.\n\nGary Cooper does a magnificent job as Henry &quot;Lou&quot; Gehrig despite being two years older, for starters; and, several years older (41 playing someone in their twenties) near the beginning of the movie while at Columbia University.\n\nWalter Brennan is brilliant as always! Teresa Wright is stunning! Besides Babe Ruth, until watching this recently on TCM, I didn&apos;t realize that other New York Yankees&apos; teammates of Gehrig&apos;s were also in the movie as themselves - Bob Meusel; Bill Dickey; and, some others. This made the movie that-much-more enjoyable this time around! It falls into the category of movies that can be watched over and over again.\n\nI also like the &apos;innocence&apos; of a movie like this as it can be viewed by everyone in the family - from small children who love real-life heroes to the elderly who remember these heroes from real-life.\n\nAlthough there are a few biographical errors about Lou Gehrig&apos;s life...overall, the movie is fantastic, even if you&apos;re not a real baseball fan! If you are a real baseball fan...this movie is a must-see!",

No, it&apos;s not some summit of art, but it&apos;s a textbook example of how to tell a story, keep the audience&apos;s attention, and honor the dramatic basis of the project instead of indulging in &quot;artistic&quot; whims and triviliaties that will appear dated in five or six years.\n\nI&apos;ll be watching this one again.  (By the way, I found the distant shot of the striking workers marching across the plain especially moving.  And I had the feeling throughout the film that this was how things really looked at that terrible period of French, and European, history.)",

The stupid part which is a rip off of every other romcom is where the title character played by the generic Charlie Sheen look-alike Getty falls for the real deal girl who he&apos;s known since K and who, unlike every other female in the flick, is somewhat normal. Blatant silliness with all the talent on the actors side of the lens, this is film fare for a college dorm, frat house, or Navy barracks. (C)",

      "reviewBody": "HIGH TREASON was originally issued in both sound and silent versions, but for many years, only the silent version was known to survive. A few years ago, a copy of the abbreviated sound version, issued by Tiffany in the US was discovered and restored. However, it is still difficult to see, and so this review is based on the silent version.\n\nThe year is 1950 -- a popular year for science-fiction films in the 1920s -- and tensions are rising between the Federated States of Europe and the Atlantic States. A car carrying liquor breaks through a border guard and is shot down; the Atlantic States send an ultimatum to Europe, whose President, Basil Gill, wants war; although he is not implicated, arms manufacturers are shown bribing people. Only the World League of Peace, led by Humberstone Wright, and his daughter, Benita Hume, stand in the way of war. Miss Hume&apos;s boy friend is Jameson Thomas, an officer of Europe, ready to carry out his orders. Thus the conflict is not only a matter of the world and politics and money, but of love.\n\nVisually, the movie is an Art Deco feast, pitched halfway between METROPOLIS and THINGS TO COME (Raymond Massey, who starred in the latter, has a small but prominent role and can be clearly seen at about the 30-minute mark). Clothes follows the sleek design, with a lot of shiny fabric and hats midway between cloches and skullcaps. Neither does Elvey neglect the technological touches, with autogyros and biplanes flying about London, television broadcasts, sliding doors and the other paraphernalia beloved of screen sf. Percy Strong&apos;s camerawork is limber, with many a tracking shot to focus the audience&apos;s attention, and a couple of moving crane shots. British film-making may have long been considered a backwater of the industry, but British Gaumont had the resources and will to make this spectacular.\n\nThe weaknesses of this movie are twofold. First, it is very talky for a silent picture, with a lot of title cards of dialogue, doubtless reproducing speech in the sound version. Second is the rather clunky utopianism of the plot, reducing the issues of politics and economics in a theoretical world to melodrama, where singing a song can stop a military action, and national leaders can be isolated from their guards. In my rather cynical view, Realpolitik guides the powerful, who are isolated and protected from the consequences of their follies.\n\nStill, that&apos;s no way to make popular entertainment now, and was less so in 1929; and while this movies shows flaws that an examination of the sound version might more fully explain, it remains visually quite beautiful, with the lovely 23-year-old Miss Hume a high point.",

      "reviewBody": "It doesn&apos;t get any better than this.  You can count on this perennial favorite to show up every Easter just as you can count on &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; during the yuletide season.  The daddy of all contemporary religious instruction, 1956&apos;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; is blockbuster spiritual entertainment in every way, shape and form, as Cecil B. DeMille depicts the life of Moses from his birth to slavery to Mt. Sinai in grandiose, reverential style.  And what a life!\n\nThis was the first movie I ever saw at the drive-in.  I was only 6 at the time but I can remember the neighbors taking me to see this, snuggled up in pajamas and stuffed in the back seat.  The parting of the Red Sea waters, the turning of the staff to a viperous snake, the green-colored pestilence of death seeping into the homes of every first-born, the creation of the tablets, the burning bush, the booming narrative.  I sat in absolute silence and wonderment.  This is my first remembrance of any kind of movie-making and the Oscar-winning visual effects and vivid pageantry are still pretty amazing, even by today&apos;s standards.\n\nCharlton Heston, the icon of biblical story-telling, still towers over anybody who has ever TRIED to played Moses ¬ñ before or since.  Stalwart and stoic to a fault, he possess THE look...cut out of pages of my old religious instructions book....the look that radiates magnificence and glory...the look of a man who has definitely seen God.  His commanding stature and voice with its slow, deliberate intonation is eerie and unmatched.  Yul Brynner portrays Ramses II as if he were the King of Siam in Egyptian pants. Nobody poses or plays majestic like Yul.  He&apos;s forceful, regal, imperious...everything a  biblical foe should be.  Anne Baxter as the tempting Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt, borders on total camp in her role, her stylized line readings and breathy allure is laughable now, with posturings and reaction shots not seen since Theda Bara.  But who cares?  Baxter provides the most fun and its her florid scenes that I now look most forward to ¬ñ whether she&apos;s throwing herself at the totally disinterested Moses or verbally sparring with Ramses, slyly pushing his emotional buttons.  She alone puts the &quot;k&quot; in kitsch.  The rest of the huge cast is appropriately stiff and solemn.\n\nDeMille&apos;s 1923 original version of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; is hardly subtle as well, but still impressive and certainly worth a look.  In the 1956 remake, DeMille organizes a cavalcade of thousands to lend authenticity to the massive exodus scenes, while the ultimate picture-perfect frame for me is the three beautiful slave extras posing exotically and dramatically on a rock in front of a vivid blue-gray backdrop of furious, threatening clouds as Moses parts the sea.  That vision alone is one for the books.\n\nWhenever I am tempted to break a commandment or embrace that golden calf, I know I&apos;ll always have to answer to Charlton ¬ñ glaring down from Mt. Sinai ready to throw those heavy tablets at me for my transgression.  Charlton not only sets you straight, he makes you BELIEVE!",

Way to go David! My favorite part about this film is that it&apos;s range of emotions it provokes. There is comedy, suspense, drama, sadness, and happiness! I also found it to be very informative, I learned so much from it. It&apos;s really cool that it didn&apos;t give opinions and force me to feel a certain way. I definitely feel that I got to make my own decision about how I felt about Pet Overpopulation. Also, I really felt inspired to get involved with volunteering at the local Animal Shelter. I really have nothing negative to say about Best Friend Forgotten, which is strange, because I always find some fault and problem in movies I see.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1980, Exorcist director William Friedkin made yet another movie that found another great way to stir up controversy and etch itself onto the front page of newspapers. His directorial effort Cruising was a film about Al Pacino&apos;s cop character going undercover in seedy gay bars in order to catch a series of murders in the specific area. The film divided critics, enraged the homosexual community, who even held boycotts and sent Friedkin death-threats over the film, and the film forever lived with a looming cloud of infamy over its head, with more comments being made about its impact over its quality.\n\nAs someone who has recently sat through Cruising, I fully understand why. It&apos;s an only adequate little thriller that is levied by the fact that it is such a curious piece of film history. There&apos;s not too much special about it other than a decently ambiguous Pacino performance and some well-photographed atmosphere, specifically inside the gay bars. Adding to the curiosity of the film, legend has it that forty minutes of the film had to be cut for it to achieve an R-rating rather than the ominous X-rating films were being stamped with during this time. The forty minutes are rumored to contain graphic gay sex as well as intimate scenes in the gay bars between its patrons.\n\nThis brings me to Interior. Leather Bar., a sixty-minute film by the likes of James Franco and Travis Mathews. The film is a mockumentary, following the Franco and Mathews as they attempt to assemble, cast, and reimagine the lost forty minutes of Cruising themselves. From the way Franco acts and interviews, one can easily see he&apos;s intrigued on how actors create an image once they begin and how they go about enforcing or affirming the image throughout careers. \n\nEvidently, Franco has used his fascination for public personas and celebrity images as the basis for Interior. Leather Bar., a thoroughly intriguing and deeply-contemplative film that possesses lengthy dialogs on the public&apos;s perception of sex as well as mumblecore-esque aesthetics and structure. I walked in assuming I was going to see the full forty minutes from Cruising recreated to fit Franco and Mathews&apos; idea of how the scenes were actually conducted. Instead, both men recreate the experience of working on the set of a film with graphic scenes of gay sex when a majority of the actors - at least the main ones - are straight males, many with wives and kids. We get the opinions of all the actors working on recreating this lost footage to Franco and Mathews&apos; liking. This provides for a feeling of seeing unseen parts of a film without seeing the specific parts, if that makes even an inkling of sex.\n\nA masterful scene comes about halfway through the film, with Franco talking to the project&apos;s main star Val Lauren, assuming the role of Al Pacino&apos;s character from Cruising. Lauren is a longtime friend of Franco, willing to help him out even on the most uncertain and unpredictable project thus far, but is having a hard time going through with a lot of the heavily gay scenes. He also has a difficult time understand the project&apos;s significance and Franco has a hard time explaining it. When Lauren and Franco (who, I believe, is playing himself here) sit down to talk about the scene, Franco goes into a discussion similar to the one I&apos;ve had many times about how in many pieces of media, even something as minute and as trite as a commercial for toothpaste or toilet paper, we see a man and a woman. When we do see two men or two women together, presumably in a relationship, it isn&apos;t uncommon for there to be some uncomfortable vibes oozing through, to which Franco (and myself) blame on our exposure to one particular lifestyle for much of our life.\n\nFranco then dives into a discussion about how censorship boards shiver at the thought of graphic sexual content but barely flinch when they see explicit violence on screen. &apos;So violence is natural but sex, something everyone does, thinks about, and even views, isn&apos;t?&apos; is a question he asks Lauren. Franco basically settles on the idea that he is making this film to try and steer us away from the thought of one particular lifestyle, as well as breaking down his own personal apprehension and uncomfortableness around this kind of material.\n\nInterior. Leather Bar. also seems to be acceptable to view as a time capsule for how gays are portrayed in cinema. Cruising wasn&apos;t blatantly homophobic in my eyes, but did possess somewhat understanding apprehension and caution to the lifestyle it greatly involved itself with. Interior. Leather Bar. presents its club scenes (when we do get a chance to see them, though they make up less than ten percent of the film) and even one major gay sex scene with a beautiful tenderness that would be given to an explicit sex scene between two women. Franco and Mathews&apos; depiction of gay sex is a harmonious and wonderfully raw approach and an experience that could very well emphasize the theme of equality in the regard of how gay sex and straight sex are depicted.\n\nWhat a beautiful film Interior. Leather Bar. is, centering its sights on conversation and emotion rather than basic shock and awe. I&apos;m still not one-hundred percent show I know what to make of it, but to speak fairly, I don&apos;t believe Franco really is either. However, I believe he has made something that he will likely look back on as one of his most audacious and daring films ever, which says a lot for an actor in his thirties who, judging by some risky choices recently, is just getting started.",

That at least was the feeling this movie gave me but I don&apos;t actually know if this truly was the case for this movie.\n\nThe approach definitely adds to the realistic feeling of the movie. It&apos;s being a random slice of life if you will, though it still is very much following a type of story that you will only see in a movie. The characters and the way how they are handling certain situations still make sure that the movie feels like a realistic one.\n\nBut because of it that the movie feels like it got done guerrilla style, the movie also doesn&apos;t have the best looking and sounding quality to it. The sound is simply just bad at times and the cinematography also really isn&apos;t being anything all too special or stylish to watch. Guess they thought that in this cast the story and the storytelling would be enough to create a great movie with but I just still missed far too many (basic) movie-making ingredients in this movie, that can make a movie of this sort great for me.\n\nAnd lets face it, the main reason why this movie still floats around is because it got directed, written and stars Barbara Loden, who was married to legendary film-maker Elia Kazan, making this a bit of a curiosity piece perhaps. But really, there is not much about this movie that stands out. It&apos;s being a good and original little movie within its genre but I only wished that the movie also would had had more to offer, with its main story and characters perhaps. I simply didn&apos;t got an awful lot out of this movie but I can at least say about this movie that I was never annoyed or bored with it.\n\nDefinitely a watchable and good movie but just nothing to run out for, in my opinion.\n\n7/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "In the beginning there was a tree, an autumn tree. It had lost its leaves. But there was fruit on it left for the birds.\n\nSnow fell already. Strange clouds appeared, as if it were summer, not autumn. The sky was dark and deep. Thunder could be heard. There was movement over the water. There were birds. Birds who flew for no other reason than beauty alone. Then the clouds changed. The sky became flat. The light shone upon G-d&apos;s command.\n\nI was afraid of falling. Someone left me. I started to feel better. I breathed deeply. Then movement started. I realized it was winter. I was cold. I could almost touch the road. So smooth and transparent. Houses appeared, like an abandoned village under a cold sun. Windows, roofs. And the people? It must be noon, but where are the people? Grey buildings, like prisons. Then came the fog. (confusion).\n\nI found myself on a clearing.\n\nThe world created out of darkness and winter and fear, child born, movement, then abandoned, G-dless, fatherless, nationless, but grateful for the freedom of free will. Fragile berry fruit tree, its branches, stiffened and frozen into place like burnt nerves (Plath), a wintry tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil with &quot;fruit on it left for the birds&quot;. The fruit of this tree teaching the cycle of life and nourishment and struggle and survival and death and rebirth and beauty.\n\nSpectacular scenery of leaden winter clouds in heavens in the darkest dark of the night overlooking black wintry landscapes. Lunar ambiance and lunar silence and lunar seclusion. Voyager the satellite of history, trying to understand his inborn orbit to a G-d, to a father, to a nation, to a life that cut him off and abandoned him at birth.\n\nA wall of snow soundlessly wheeling and reeling in a steady downriver current like a river current frothing forward in a storm, an apt metaphor for the many nations and peoples that drifted without a base after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and an apt metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. A wall of snow drift reeling forward like one gigantic moving mass of migratory disintegration.\n\nSokurov, our narrator, our voyager, noctivagant. Going back in time to the place of his birth and voyaging through his past and the past of his country and the past of history itself. Travelling across across frontiers of nations and borders, traveling through monastic, nautical, museologic spaces. Dark strokes of Classical music and the distantiated echoes of ambient sound, haunting musical haiku conveying Sokurov&apos;s existential turmoil.\n\nVoyager, guided by a monk enters a monastery in Valdai (Old Russia), a journey to find G-d, to understand G-d, to understand Jesus&apos; sacrifice, to study the spirit of a man in the throes of death and an empire in the throes of death and a history in the throes of death, Voyager like Abraham of the Bible, Abram heeding G-d&apos;s call of Lech Lecha, and, after passing G-d&apos;s tests of faith and accepting G-d&apos;s promises to multiply his seed, evolving into Abraham, officially setting up the shop of Judaism which later forged Christianity, but Voyager is beginning at the end of that, faithless and spiritually decayed and identityless. Sokurov asking the monk, why did Christ pray that his Father not send him to his sacrificial cross? Why did Christ, want to avoid crucifixion? If he so loathed being crucified, then how can I accept his sacrifice? Why did I speak about this? His monk keeps silent, G-d fails to answer, the Christ (in Sokurov&apos;s view) nothing more than a mere mortal on an equal plane with all of humanity in his resistance to death, the implication being Why is Humankind invested in Christ&apos;s sacrifice if He was unwilling to make it, a Baptism occurring in the background ends, a soldier on a pew jars the moment, war invoked and Voyager perhaps remembering himself as a soldier, a fleeting flashback of soldiers crosses the screen, Voyager coalesces back into uninhabited nocturnal landscapes and his own interiorized private world of exilic and religious and spiritual alienation and despair.\n\nVoyager is eternity&apos;s hostage and prisoner of time, he&apos;s exilic and unhomed and displaced theologically, nationalistically, culturally, and historically.\n\nVoyager not knowing what location he&apos;s leaving and where he&apos;s going, destabilized location, Guideless, he doesn&apos;t know where he came from or where he&apos;s going to, he doesn&apos;t know who he was or who he will become, he doesn&apos;t know where G-d is or where his father is or where his nation is or who or what will guide him, the ship, perhaps Noah&apos;s Arc, carrying him beyond the flood of threatening-but-indifferent waves that fill every corner of the earth, transporting him away from his barren abandoned provincial rural Eastern locality and relocating him Westward in cosmopolitan Germany (the trajectory from East to West invoking a reversal of Germany&apos;s wartime West-East invasion of Russia), a Germany blanketed beneath a continual falling powdery wall of migratory disintegrating downriver streams of snow.\n\nVoyager whispering, the canvas remains warm, the body remains warm yet must it still die, the spirit remains warm yet must the spirit also die? All the paintings except Van Gogh&apos;s include rivers and most appear to also include boats, the boats the body and the water the soul and the spirit and the boats on the water representing the journey into the great unknown, towards death. The camera also passes over two empty frames, spiritless man, coincidence or prophetic.\n\nLast painting, the camera literally enters Bruegel&apos;s Tower of Babel, a glorious surface exploration of a crumbling arcesque Ur-text Torah-text, covenant between humanity and G-d shattered, humankind scattered and abandoned, hammering in the theme of humanity&apos;s disconnect with its Creator (G-d, father, Nation) and humanity&apos;s destructive impulses and apocalypse, the screen turns black.",

Then someone changed her name, gave her electrolysis on her forehead, and dyed her hair.\n\nHere she plays a dancer, Jerry Wheeler, whose brother Chick (Edgar Edwars) has been framed for the murder of his gold-digging girlfriend. Jerry is determined to save her brother from execution and works with a police detective (Charles Quigley) to find the identity of the real killer.\n\nBy this time, she was Rita Hayworth and of course was a beauty even before the drastic changes. She also gives a very earnest performance and dances beautifully.\n\nThis is a pretty routine B, and short at that, but Rita made it worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors; Tim Blake Nelson, Joe Pants, and Glenn Headley, while not my &apos;faves&apos;, are nonetheless always a good supporting cast, sturdy character actors. Anyway, I was predisposed to like this movie, and I kinda did. It wasn&apos;t a great movie, which was a surprise and a disappointment. It was sort of dim, and had--- not a darkness, exactly--- but a kind of a threadbare-ness, a shabbiness about it. It wasn&apos;t just that the characters portrayed were low-lifes, poor, uneducated, and mostly losers (albeit kindly ones). The dimness went deeper than that. Maybe the film was blurred, or the lighting wasn&apos;t crisp--- dunno. But SOMETHING was &apos;off&apos;, like milk on the last day of its shelf life. You keep asking yourself--- has this gone bad? But then, you keep drinking it.\n\nAnd the studio changed the movie&apos;s name. I saw it in Wales (in the UK), months ago. Evidently the advance buzz was pretty bad. So they changed it from &apos;The Moguls&apos; to &apos;The Amateurs&apos;. A sure sign of desperation. But, alas, that&apos;s not going to save it.\n\nJeff Bridges plays lovable, &apos;ordinary&apos; guys that are extra solid, and extra real. He plays characters that are very easy for a man (I&apos;m about his age, and coincidentally lived in Santa Barbara, his town, for years) to relate to. At least I do. It appears, based on his wide appeal, that women like him too. I also admire him for eschewing the Red Carpet, paparazzi-chasing kind of celebrity grab that so many other actors have fallen prey to (IMHO: Brad Pitt, Ben Afflect, Julia Roberts, to name but a few). Unfortunately, the tone set here was either missed, or set too low. Bridge&apos;s characters, and the supporting cast&apos;s characters, are just too loser-y, too dim, too depressing.\n\nThis movie also reminded me of &apos;The Big Lebowski&apos;--- another Jeff Bridges movie, and another dark-ish movie about low-lifes, but one that was much, much better done than &apos;The Moguls&apos; (now known as &apos;The Amateurs&apos;). The derivativeness kind of rankled with me a bit.\n\nThis movie could have been brighter, funnier, and stronger. It could have been better. It has a few things to admire, though, so if you&apos;ve seen everything else at your theater, or nothing else strikes your fancy, try this one. And, let&apos;s all hope meanwhile that Jeff Bridges&apos; next movie will be more like his usual great work.",

The woman who would sometimes forget her dog was dead--I went through that myself in my teens with my beloved childhood dog, so I know how painful it is. And the cemetery owner&apos;s theory that pets are more important now because of the pill makes a lot of sense. Nevertheless, I feel certain Christopher Guest MUST have had this film in mind when he made &quot;Best in Show&quot;! Oh my god there is some unintended hilarity here. On the part of the interviewees, that is; I&apos;m sure Morris knew what he had. The cemetery family, the rendering plant manager...hoo boy! The overall feeling, though, is that we love our animals and they are indeed very special and precious. \n\nThe elderly woman talking about her ungrateful bum of a son was very sad...I&apos;m going to go call my mother right now."

We follow two high school buddies (Kaleil and Tom) from their coming up with a name and idea for their site to their breakup and demise. The emotions are all there, from elation to despair. You are there for everything. Though the film has no narration you can still tell what is going on if you pay attention.\n\nThis is an interesting piece of life in the late 20th century. You&apos;ll think about these guys the next time you go cruising through the internet. If you see it, rent it."

And the story is very original and interesting. Adam is a boy who grew up in a bomb shelter with his parents, who fear that a nuclear bomb struck from the cold war. For 35 years they raise Adam to be a perfect gentleman. When he wants to meet a lady and the parents need more suplies for the shelter, they send him up to face the world of the 90&apos;s. He meets a girl, Eve. She seems cold at first, but they both fall for each other.\n\nThe story lacks a little something in some area. I thought they maybe should&apos;ve gotten more into the love story, because I felt like it was too quick. But this is a cute and wonderful film. I would recommend for romantic comedy type of lovers. They would more than likely get into the film.\n\n 7/10",

It started out OK but as the movie went on I find myself paying less and less attention to the screen. Creature design is interesting and cool looking, but that&apos;s probably the most interesting about the movie.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t complain too much about acting, because I didn&apos;t really expect some excellent performances in these kind of movie, but David Gale really went over-the-top even more then his usual self. \n\nWhat I find really funny is monster concept itself. It&apos;s suppose to be indestructible bio-engineered super-soldier that&apos;s half machine, half organic, that can reproduce itself every 24h that would replace American soldiers on the battlefield. Yet, creature seems to easily goes down by shotgun-to-the-face and water!? I find that incredibly funny, because for a super-soldier it has two major weaknesses: firearms and water.\n\nA semi-sequel to cult movie &quot;Scared to Death&quot; from early &apos;80s, but you can watch it as stand alone movie. \n\n&quot;Synapse&quot; released this on DVD (along with it&apos;s mother movie), which has some bonus features. So if it&apos;s your coup of tea, go for it, but I think &quot;Syngenor&quot; makes a better trailer then a movie.",

      "reviewBody": "A KVIFF screening of this year&apos;s Teddy winner in Berlin International Film Festival, from American director Ira Sachs. It is a detailed dissection of the a tug-of-war gay relationship between Erik and Paul, which soldiers on almost a decade in the present-time (1997-2006).\n\nThure Lindhardt, the Danish out-of-the-closet actor who has shown the immense stretch in the skin-head gay-romance BROTHERHOOD (2009, an 8/10), transforms himself into a young immigrant documentary director Erik living in NYC, probably sex-addictive, met the dandy boy Peter (Zachary Booth), first time for sexual intercourse, then the mutual attraction brings both into a relationship complex, which encompasses an overt hindrance, Paul&apos;s drug-addition, a clich√© default even makes for the consistent trappings of gay life, thanks to the barren soil of the genre.\n\nIt&apos;s hard not to compare this film with last year&apos;s indie darling WEEKEND (2011, an 8/10), both stand out among other numerous lesser achievers, but in very disparate ways. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON is a sultry relationship conundrum exhausts one&apos;s vigor even dignity to sustain the suffocating love; while WEEKEND concentrates on the bad-timing symptom after a casual sex date which one must cut off his feeling and affection. Different terms, same payoff. Nevertheless, both films have a cracking two-hander cast, in this case, Lindhardt and Booth are fervently suited to their tailor-made roles, especially Lindhardt, literally carries the film on his shoulders to elaborate a not-so-extraordinary script, I do hope he will not be stereotyped into the gay-actor-can-never-act-straight category for his future career. \n\nThe film at large is a mean-well, sincere work with some uneasy aftertaste, but never accomplishes itself as a boredom, a welcome 7 out of 10 is my indulgence.",

      "reviewBody": "Certainly this is one of Joan Crawford&apos;s best movies. She beautiful in the dated &quot;Grand Hotel.&quot; She really acts in &quot;The Women.&quot; She&apos;s fine in the high melodrama of &quot;Possessed.&quot; She&apos;s very good in &quot;Mildred Pierce.&quot; And &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; is a fine noir.\n\nApart from Ms. Crawford, for the moment, we have the plot: A child in Ireland is in a terrible accident, in which her mother dies. She becomes blind and deaf and loses the ability to speak as a result of the trauma. This, by the way, is the title character, not Ms. Crawford. That was also rare in her career and maybe a first here.\n\nAs someone very knowledgeable about the blind, I give this a very high rating. This is only a personal feeling but I prefer it to the famous &quot;Miracle Worker,&quot; which to me is overwrought and, though based on a true life, not very accurate.\n\n&quot;The Story of Esther Costello&quot; is accurate. The scenes at the school on Long Island to which Crawford takes Esther, well played by Heather Sears, are believable. The Braille is well researched, as are other aspects of her learning.\n\nAs Esther grows up, she becomes a very pretty young m=woman. Without giving away the plot, she is abused and raped. This is sadly still true of the lives of blind woman and women with other disabilities. They are taken advantage of by parents and other relatives, by schoolmates, and very often by spouses. The same is true, to a lesser degree, of disabled men.\n\nMake no mistake: This is no arid treatise. It has its campy moments, as well as its legitimately exciting ones. Among the former are Crawford&apos;s swank no matter where she is and the irony of her becoming a sort of foster mother here in light of later revelations by her own daughter.\n\nThis is a painful movie but a very fine one.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched again, and reviewed here, MONSTER HOUSE, which is, like PARANORMAN, an animated horror movie for kids (actually, both feature as main character a boy who has a fat-and-funny friend). I&apos;m not sure if MONSTER HOUSE appeared in the great Fangoria magazine, but PARANORMAN did. I was already interested in watching it on the big screen when I found out the Fangoria coverage, which was just the plus. I was interested for the obvious reason: stop-motion material from the people responsible of CORALINE (not Henry Selick tough). This is clearly the sort-of little stop-motion film of year (and I said sort-of little since it had a pretty big publicity campaign here in Mexico City) while Tim Burton&apos;s upcoming FRANKENWEENIE is like the big and long-awaited one.\n\nThere is some good news. While we wait to found out if Burton finally does something great after almost 10 years, here we have a film that will give movie geeks really cool stuff. Needless to say, kids won&apos;t enjoy some of the elements that most likely you will, fellow reader. Well, you will if you&apos;re into very cool horror tributes, in the way Quentin Tarantino would be proud, and nice takes on witch-hunt¬Ö and into zombies, of course. Talking about the zombies here, well, I recalled what Guillermo Del Toro&apos;s said about CRONOS; he said basically that the vampire from his film is like the saddest vampire ever. I won&apos;t say much, only that here we can think in the zombies as sad and confused human beings. The main character Norman is not the classic happy kid as well; you&apos;ll love him by just seeing his liking for horror ‚Äì actually, not every day we have an animated movie that opens like something out of a Grindhouse. And there&apos;s good humor (and McLovin as a bully with stretched piercing ‚Äì I watched the 2D Spanish dubbed version tough), so yes, it&apos;s worth watching! \n\n*Watched it on 08 August, 2012",

A long time ago, he was kidnapped and tortured in a prison camp. He&apos;s mistakenly the target of Sullivan (Stuart Wilson), an evil drug maker. Cage is then injected with a drug that makes him hallucinate. If you look into Snipes&apos; eyes, you can see he doesn&apos;t care about the movie.\n\nHe still puts in a professional performance though. It looks like he&apos;s forced to do his martial arts.

One of his films, Snobs, is listed in the Time Out film guide, so at least he was spotted by one critic. Mocky is an anarchist within the French film industry: he flails around, shooting at targets on the right and left, not hitting much.\n\nDeneuve, Bohringer, Novembre, and Scott-Thomas all are pretty stiff here, not knowing what they&apos;re supposed to do. The story is a mess; why is Bohringer shooting all those people with a handgun equipped with silencer? Why the long bus tour, which seems to go nowhere? Why does Catherine Deneuve wear that silly wig, which makes her look so frumpy? Why am I watching this?"

      "reviewBody": "Formally, &quot;Die Innere Sicherheit&quot; is a road-movie, it shows in a kind of natural suspense the life of a young family, of Hans and Carla and their 15years old daughter Jeanne (who is supposed to have a French name but mispronounces it). The family has never rest, the flight is how they are living. When they sleep, one of them has always to stay awake in order to pay attention if nobody shows up. Although the movie does not give any hints in which time the story plays, it is to assume that it is contemporaneous with the time when the movie was shot, thus in 2000. Hans and Carla are terrorists and work in the &quot;underground&quot;. From the commentary of the director, Christian Petzold, we learn that they belong to the RAF (Red Army Fraction) who was responsible for many assassinations and other terrorist acts in the 70ies and 80ies. The RAF itself was convinced that Germany is ruled by the successors of the Nazis and therefore the government is illegal. However, Hans and Carla seem to be decades too late, they appear in their present like lost from their past, more precisely: lost in transition before their enemies who would treat them like normal criminals in order not to glorify the Baader-Meinhof clan. When Hans and Carla need help and contact their former collaborators, it turns out that they are either since long time not in business anymore or turned in their hopelessness into drinkers. (I am convinced that in the character of Klaus a once very famous German publisher is accurately portrayed: He ended on a park bench in the &quot;Tiergarten&quot; with bottles of red wine around him.) For the daughter, however, the life of her parents becomes more and more intolerable. She cannot make any friends, and when she does, she does not see them anymore, because the steady flight is moving them from nowhere to nowhere. She cannot go regularly to school and is taught basically by her mother. Although the parents are supposed to be adherents of the once famous &quot;laissez-faire&quot;-education, they use police-interrogation methods when they want to find out whom Jeanne contacted and with whom she slept. Both parents smoke, but the daughter is not supposed to. Some of the former RAF-adherents have turned into Neo-Nazis.\n\nI recommend this movie highly. The story develops out of itself, there are no commentaries, no artificially built-in suspense, no pretentiousness. It is true, the movie is dark and depressive, but also soothingly anti-Hollywood. Christian Petzold has already given us such excellent movies like &quot;Cuba Libre&quot;, &quot;Wolfsburg&quot;, &quot;Toter Mann&quot;, the marvelous &quot;Yella&quot; and, most lately, &quot;Jerichow&quot; which is to appear on DVD. So I am looking forward to the upcoming works of this highly promising director.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are like me and enjoy Sir A. C. Doyle&apos;s version of Holmes and the other characters in the Holmes stories and how they contribute immensely tot he stories, then you may want to pass on this movie. On the other hand,I have read every story ever written by Doyle, Day, and L. King... and I can never get enough Holmes. If this sounds like you too, then it might be worth a gander. I will not ruin it for you by telling you what happens, but about 3/4 of the way through, there is a huge twist in the story...Don&apos;t worry.. you wont miss it... and for that reason, Idisliked the movie. This was only because I am such a nitpicker about accuracy when it comes to following Doyle&apos;s work. However... if you enjoy Holmes stories, and you like it when they are told in a different light than that of Doyle&apos;s (like Laurie King does, who.. If I may contradict myself a little... is my favorite writer) then you may like this movie. Personally it was ruined for me because of it&apos;s inaccuracy&apos;s But, if you don&apos;t mind that, and you are like me and want to see everything you can with Holmes in it, then watch and (hopefully)enjoy. As for the special effects that others have commented on in other reviews... What do you expect, it is only a &quot;B&quot; movie... and it was made in England! (Not that I do not agree with the others when Isay that the effects suck, but they do not ruin the movie) Lastly, I wanted to add that I gave the movie a 3 out of 10 rating because of My own experience with it and how I felt. Coincidently, you may have a different opinion on the movie if you can look past the movies inaccuracies like I cant.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1940, almost the entire population of a town in New Hampshire mysteriously leave their homes, their belongings and even their pets, and head north along a trail into the dense wilderness. The corpses of those discovered are the only trace of what might have happened to the people of Friar. Many years later, Teddy Barnes and a team of researchers, pathfinders, historians and psychologists decide to follow the same trail and uncover the mystery of what happened in 1940. But what waits for them at the end of the trail - and will they survive to reach it?\n\nI know what you&apos;re thinking. This is a movie about a group of people who, whilst following a mysterious trail through the wilderness in search of answers, begin to perish. It therefore must involve masked killers or mutated bears, right? Actually, no. &quot;YellowBrickRoad&quot; takes its inspiration from some of the classic older horror movies ‚Äì such as &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot; and the original version of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; ‚Äì and, instead of aiming purely for the eyes of the audience, it also aims for the mind. This is a slow-burning psychological horror filled with sights and sounds which get under your skin and worm their way into your brain; just as they do with the characters themselves.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say that there isn&apos;t gore or violence in &quot;YellowBrickRoad&quot;. There are several scenes involving terrible, bloody things happening to people, but the film-makers shoot those scenes in a way that forces the audience to let their imaginations run rampant and fill in the gaps. It&apos;s not really these death scenes that will stick with you after the movie has ended, though. It&apos;s the way that &quot;YellowBrickRoad&quot; forces you to watch as the seemingly well-adjusted individuals to whom you&apos;re introduced at the beginning rapidly drift into insanity, rage, loneliness, brutality and utter confusion as the rules of reality change around them.\n\nFor a good portion of its running time, &quot;YellowBrickRoad&quot; is a creepy and unsettling story that fully preys upon our fear of the unknown. Without resorting to cheap scares, the movie accurately portrays how a group of people might act if they took too many steps northward and suddenly found themselves in the Twilight Zone. All of the main actors do a fine job and, despite working with an obviously limited budget, the directors utilise sound, along with moody, lonesome cinematography and the rustic setting to create a tense and spooky atmosphere.\n\nSome may have a problem with the ending which perhaps veers a bit too closely into David Lynch territory, but I found it to be an interesting and apt way of closing the movie. For those who are fans of horror cinema, such as &quot;Session 9&quot; or &quot;The Shining&quot;, in which the protagonists are confronted with something unknown and terrible that slowly burns away at their sanity and willpower, this may be close to essential viewing for you.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a movie that will grab your attention. You will develop interest in the characters and the story that they are in. However, the movie doesn&apos;t take you anywhere and that seems to be the glaring problem. All movies need an arc. Stories are suppose to have some sort of end. While the beginning and even middle of this story draw you in and end falls flat. While the acting in the movie is above average and while production value is very good the obvious whole is too much to look past. What we are left with is the script that simply has no idea where it is going. This is why this movie is rated as 6/10 on the site.\n\nWe get an interest in these characters and their story but it doesn&apos;t actually have any interesting story to tell you about them. The whole movie is simply a waiting for the climax that never comes. As if they pieced together scenes to generate interest but then take it nowhere.\n\nI love the concept, the acting, the production. But this is a script that needed a lot of work before being shot. As the story needs to be more than simply the effects of the disease. We are expecting more from these characters story lines. Stories about nothing tend to be nothing anyone wants to watch. The last thing a movie should do is leave the audience wanting in a bad way at the end. I give it a 7/10 which is more than most rated it. Because there is a fair bit of quality work here. It&apos;s not that the movie isn&apos;t interesting. It is. It just lets you down after such a good start.",

      "reviewBody": "The usually unfortunate Marga (Emma Suarez) is having a streak of bad luck. She attempts to regain her self-confidence through her friendship with Rosa (Rosana Pastor) , but complicated love interests again create conflict . Along the way , she&apos;s developing a relationship with a handsome gay sculptor 10 years her junior, called I√±aqui (Juan Diego Botto) . With this sui-generis love story Marga begins improving herself and eventually both of whom feel happiness. Marga and I√±aqui go beyond friendship, but are frustrated by their limitations of couple .\n\nThird film by Alfonso Albacete and David Menkes that unlike his two previous ones : ¬®More than Love Frenzi¬®and ¬®Atomica¬® leave aside choral comedy to show the drama of a young woman who wants to move on , to whom life is taking things and adding things to her. The script is written by the two directors and by Lucia Etxebarria who also makes a small cameo as an actress, as well as the director Fernando Colomo. The story mixes drama, comedy and romance. This shows that contrary to what many believe, the opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality : the will to be alive and to continue assuming that life is not perfect. Concerning a peculiar love story between a sympathetic gay young and a hard-working girl with a young child who tries to carve out her future through a hard life , but ultimately, the two might have to settle for an &quot;impossible&quot; romance as their unique best road to happiness .One of the main diversions of the film is to find out which well-known supporting actor is appearing here and there, these include the following : Mirta Ibarra , Rosana Pastor , Manuel Manqui√±a , Maite Blasco , Alex Brendem√ºhl , Javier Mart√≠n , Adri√† Collado , Elena Irureta , Alberto San Juan , Jos√© Manuel Cervino , Fernando Tejero Alfredo Villa , N√∫ria Prims , Paz Vega , Mar√≠a Esteve , Luc√≠a Etxebarr√≠a , Fernando Guill√©n , among others.\n\nIt displays an evocative musical score with a lot of catching songs : Escuela de calor written by Santiago Auser√≥n, Luis Auser√≥n, performed by Radio Futura ; Alegr√≠a de vivir written/performed by Ray Heredia ; Sobrevivir√© written by Manzanita performed by Estrella Morente ; Me voy pa Sinabic√∫ written by Jos√© Delgado performed by Vieja Trova Santiaguera ; Sobrevivir√© written and performed by Manzanita ; Cala√≠to written and performed by Paco Ortega ; Eres luz written by Paco Ortega and E. Fern√°ndez performed by Ni√±a Pastori ; ¬øAmigas? Written by Jos√© V√°zquez and Paco Ortega performed by Jos√© Losada ; Cara Caf√© written by Ram√≥n Pisa and E. Fern√°ndez performed by Gritos de Guerra ; En La Habana written and performed by Paco Ortega ; Cartita de amor written by Sim√≥n Cort√©s and Carmen Josefa Heredia performed by Angelita Heredia ; Moon River written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer adapted by Paco Ortega performed by Josep Salvador ; Sevillanas de la vida written by Paco Ortega performed by Alba Molina; La hu√≠da written by Paco Ortega . As well as colorful cinematography by Gonzalo F. Berridi. The motion picture was well directed by Alfonso Albacete and David Menkes. They&apos;re well known as directors and writers , specially known for At√≥mica (1998), M√°s que amor, frenes√≠ (1996) , Entre vivir y so√±ar (2004) , Mentiras y gordas (2009) , Solo Quimica (2015) , La novia de Am√©rica (2023) and Sobrevivir√© (1999).

I was in two minds about this movie before we watched it, having so many big name actors all in one movie I thought might detract from the story somewhat, but I thought it might work if they do it right. Well, they did. This movie had me feeling for, well, MOST of the main characters. Ashton Kutcher was very good in this movie, he also had one of the bigger roles and he pulled it off really well. The others were mostly good too, Taylor Swift&apos;s character was kind of annoying, but I think she was supposed to be. The story had me intrigued from beginning to end, seeing how all the different characters were connected and the chemistry between each couple was very believable also. If you watch this with your partner, it will make you feel closer. If you watch this without your partner, it will make you miss them. If you watch this while single, it will give you hope that there&apos;s someone out there for you. I&apos;d recommend this to anyone who&apos;s looking for a good valentines day romance or even just a good movie. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Billy Crudup stars in this slow moving film as &quot;Cal&quot;, an architect who one day just walks out on his loving wife and son. What Cal is in search of we know not, but he is full of self-loathing for leaving and begins a drunken trek cross country. In his travels he meets a series of people who he treats like crap and then wallows in more self loathing and drink. The movie does end up with a moral; Cal realizes that he had it pretty good at home, but we don&apos;t realize this until we&apos;ve sat through at least the first ninety minutes wondering where this movie and Cal, for that matter, are headed. Adding to the confusion are some flashback sequences that are never explained and have nothing to do with the ending what-so-ever. The only bright spot is when Cal meets up with Dulcie (Moore), and you think &quot;Aha! I know where this movie is headed&quot;, and then it doesn&apos;t go that way at all. And that&apos;s a shame. Dulcie&apos;s story line is dropped just as the movie takes a turn towards being remotely interesting, and we are sent right back on Cal&apos;s boring journey. There is nothing redeemable in the character of Cal, and what he needs is a swift kick to the butt. Add to that a soundtrack that is ninety percent Willie Nelson songs, and you can see where a good shot of caffeine prior to watching this movie will come in handy. On an upnote, the cinematography was beautiful; it just should have been saved for a better movie. If you really need to be told that there&apos;s no place like home, watch &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; instead.",

By the end of the film you are ready to strangle one of the characters. This film has points where you might guess what will happen. But it also has some real zingers that are unexpected and makes you say wow.\n\nIt takes us along the path of high school clicks, and the reputation of young girls. Sure it leaves out boys which are half of the equation, but you have to remember when this was made. Taking that into account, it really does parallel current situations more that it does not. \n\nWatch it - This is something really worthwhile.",

Yaphet Kotto is one of the most underrated actors ever, and he&apos;s amazing as the evil pimp Velvet Blue! Lt. Uhura from Star Trek as a merciless female pimp! A white pimp with a diamond studded eyepatch! This is a movie that every adult in America should see, seriously.

The movie while obviously low-budget (no different than we&apos;ll say &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; or &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; at this particular time in UK productions), yet its concentration on the inherent drama of a confused and conflicted ex-Para in a non-empathetic society totally over-rode its budgetary limitations. \n\nThis was an above-average movie (and a rare one) of its genre and adequately displays Washington&apos;s versatility as an actor.",

      "reviewBody": "Raining on the Mountain is a sorely neglected little gem of a Chinese flick. I would say &quot;kung fu flick&quot;, but that&apos;s almost wholly untrue. There are several fight scenes (most notably near the climax), but the film seems much more interested in the fluidity and the composition of these scenes than the actual viscera of the bloody mouths and body blows. There&apos;s a sort of extravagant economy of motion here: everything is done for the effect, but nothing feels gratuitous or superfluous; it&apos;s simply done so well that you breeze through without giving it a thought. A good portion of this film consists of people running, ducking and hiding behind things, but Hu, being behind the pen, behind the camera and apparently behind the editing equipment as well, presents the entire film like a dance, no matter what they&apos;re doing.\n\nThe plot concerns a number of characters scheming towards two major aims inside a Buddhist monastery: an esquire and a general both looking to obtain a priceless handwritten scroll from their library, using various means (including a faux-concubine and her bandana-clad partner-in-crime) to obtain it. Additionally, the abbot of the monastery is looking for a successor, and several of the monks are attempting to get a good word for their names through less than legitimate means: namely, getting the esquire or the general to put in a good word by assisting them in getting the scroll. The other major plot point involves a former thief (convicted, but claims falsely accused) being hounded by the lieutenant that put him behind bars, and the two of them getting into various scraps, and coming off like wounded children.\n\nThe film I was more reminded of (at least in a superficial way) was Miyazaki&apos;s The 47 Ronin. Both films have action, but aren&apos;t overly concerned with the action so much as with how the action is executed. Neither film is particularly substantial plotwise, but both exert special attention to the minutiae of politicking, and their power comes with how that plot is carried out. Just as Raining on the Mountain is mostly people dodging enough and slinking away, The 47 Ronin is a film that consists mostly of people running into rooms and informing the occupants of exciting things happening outside, and yet, both are captivating because of how they present their wares. While it occasionally grinds to a bit of a halt when it focuses on the abbot appointing, Raining on the Mountain is an evocative, sensual, breathtaking and above all enjoyable film, and with a surprisingly light, fun storyline, a memorable cast of characters, and a thrilling conclusion, it&apos;s a film I&apos;d gladly recommend to anybody that can obtain it.\n\n{Grade: 8.5/10 (B+) / #10 (of 24) of 1979}",

      "reviewBody": "I had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm, Technicolor, stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered. Also closer to the original material -- basically, all screenwriter N. Richard Nash did was trim, change much recitative to spoken dialog, and insert a transitional scene or two (including a very amusing one for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith&apos;s production design is stagy in the &quot;Li&apos;l Abner&quot;-&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; &apos;50s adaptation mode, but it works well for this work&apos;s folkloric, unrealistic quality. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to a wince-inducing degree. Further, for a movie of its time, it&apos;s pretty frank -- the adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and self-destructive habits of the denizens of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in the telling. But there are debits, beginning with all that variation from the stage text. The loss of so much compromises Gershwin&apos;s brilliance -- no wonder the family doesn&apos;t like it. The reorchestration, especially of Sammy Davis Jr.&apos;s material, is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, folks; you didn&apos;t have to mess with it so much. And while Poitier and Dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well, there&apos;s a huge chasm between the characters&apos; singing and speaking voices -- you&apos;re constantly aware of the artifice. What really counts here, of course, is the music, among the greatest ever written for the theater, anywhere. Despite all the tinkering, it survives,and you&apos;d have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. If the treatment isn&apos;t entirely to the estate&apos;s liking (and it shouldn&apos;t be), there&apos;s still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of Gershwin&apos;s masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius.",

It helps to know Africa a bit when you see it, because Bekolo is not trying to make the usual huts-and-boubous-film, but is trying to show the emotional realities of living in a corrupt, polluted, city where prostitution is rife and idealism is punished. The censorship board of Cameroon has not yet decided whether to censor it, supposedly for its sexual content but probably for its political stands. It&apos;s a pretty direct commentary on Cameroon&apos;s present government. I think the film misses its aims slightly, but that&apos;s because he was trying to do too much. He wants to show women prevailing, daring to fight back, to stand up, and he wants to adapt an African ritual (mevungu) in a modern form. He wants to make a political statement in a time when it&apos;s dangerous or irrelevant to do so. I still don&apos;t exactly get the turns of the plot, but I don&apos;t think the plot&apos;s that important. I enjoyed the images, even the MTV-ish ones, I enjoyed the references to other films, and I enjoyed the slapstick butchery, stuff you won&apos;t see in any other African film by any one else.",
