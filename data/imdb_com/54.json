There&apos;s a few good plot twists along the way and also has a little comedy in some parts, which I found myself chuckling at so hats off the people who made this film. It doesn&apos;t have the real seriousness that the Man With No Name trilogy and many other Westerns have, but some times you just want to watch a Western that&apos;s a little bit more laid back. A real fun watch with plenty of action and I found the ending to be really nice. The copy I watched didn&apos;t have the greatest picture quality but the film is old now so I can deal with that. I&apos;d be interested in trying to find a better copy some where to give this another watch and enjoy even more.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Last Relic&apos; is one of the most beloved movie in Estonia. Wonderful characters, nice location shots, lighthearted adventure and clever humor. Again. Estonians love humor.\n\nDirector Grigori Kromanov&apos;s first intentions were to create serious historical philosophical movie exploring the mythos of free man, but he was force to take much adventurous-romantic view point. The witty dialogue and catchy songs (that has became classics their own) really carry the film. And the songs, did the authors intend it or not, have actually quite deep meanings, and add quite much to the director&apos;s wanted philosophical point. The film is also historically quite inaccurate - the character of Ivo Schenkenberg has gotten very free artistic interpretation in this film. He is real historical person, but was known as heroic fighter and leader of Estonian fighters against Russian army in Livonian War. Of course, Soviet regime didn&apos;t like depicting him as a heroic character in the film. That aside, Schenkenberg played by Peeter Jakobi is probably one of the most memorable characters in Estonian cinema.\n\nThe sword fight scenes look dame even compared to it&apos;s contemporaries. One part of that can be blamed the Soviet regime who had quite heavy regulations considering fighting and violence on the screen. At least we can get a glimpse of Ingrida Andrina&apos;s (Agnes) nipples, that somehow past the eyes of censor.",

I have to say, as far as sequels of slasher movies go, this ain&apos;t that bad. It has good production values. But of course the great acting performances of the original are gone except for Tony Todd&apos;s, who is almost equally as good as he was in the original. But also gone are the great editing and photography, the gritty realistic feel of the original, the eerie and moody score of Philip Glass. Candyman just continues ripping people up with motives that are standard in slasher movies. The bees are involved more in the gory scenes, but are still underused.\n\nNot half as good as the first movie. I haven&apos;t seen the third nor am i interested in doing so.",

      "reviewBody": "I am NOT anti-Eleanor Roosevelt in any way, however, this Oscar-winning film is not something I could recommend. Why? Well, because the film does not seem like a biography at all--perhaps not even a documentary. Instead of giving a semi-balanced and occasionally critical analysis of her life, it&apos;s more an effusive tribute the the lady. While some like this sort of thing, I hate it for a film about anyone to be so gushing and fully of flowery prose (as the narration was written by a noted poet, Archibald Macleish). Heck, if I were Mrs. Roosevelt, I&apos;d be turning in my grave or haunting those who made the film because it seems so unreal--like she was being nominated for sainthood! Her life was indeed fascinating and she was an admirable woman, so perhaps there is a better documentary you can find about her---I&apos;d just steer clear of this one.\n\nBy the way, I did mention that this was an Oscar winner. Considering Eleanor Roosevelt had just recently died and was beloved by many, I can understand why the film was a winner. Today, however, I can&apos;t see it even being nominated because of its style. Plus, she is no longer held in such high regard as younger people have begun to forget who she was and her remarkable life.\n\nAlso, there was one portion of the film I did like--the discussion of her very bleak childhood. I really wanted to hear more about this and found a more human side to her here. Later, though, it got pretty bad.",

      "reviewBody": "The best fiction films are the ones that manage to capture some element of real life. It doesn&apos;t matter if they are set in a galaxy far, far away or taken straight from today&apos;s headlines. They feel real no matter how contrived. The best documentary films work in reverse. They take real life and give it scale and resonance that makes one forget that what we are watching is the mundane and common. They take things and events in life that most of us don&apos;t pay too much attention to or take for granted and elevate them to epic status. Ivars Seleckis&apos; documentaries Skersiela (Crossroad Street) and Jaunie laiki Skersiela (New Times at Crossroad Street) accomplish this with such effortless ease that one forgets that these are documentaries. They feel real and surreal at the same time. Both films take place in a small street in the Pardaugava section of Riga. The first was filmed in 1988 and the second 10 years later in 1998. The first film slowly introduces us to the residents of Crossroad Street. There&apos;s Julis the cab driver and his arch-enemy and neighbor, Aldis, a stone mason and part-time preacher, who has set up a what seems to be a major monument-making factory in his backyard. It&apos;s a noisy undertaking and a constant source of irritation to straight-laced Julis. There&apos;s poor Daiga, pregnant and abandoned by her lover. She lives as an unregistered guest of her cousin in the same house as Julis, his wife and his daughter. She fears that any moment she will be kicked out into the street. The house itself was built by and belonged to her grandfather, a famous Latvian writer, during Latvia&apos;s independence. It has been turned into communal housing by the Soviets. Daiga is now nothing more than a squatter. There&apos;s Osis, feeble-minded but gentle, who lives with his 80-year-old mother. There&apos;s Tolik, the son of a Latvian mother who was deported to Siberia and a German father whom she met and fell in love with there. He speaks only Russian and can barely move because of an untreated childhood disease he contracted in Siberia. There&apos;s Peteris and Olga, a bickering but loving, easy-going old couple who grind horseradish in their backyard for sale in the market. There&apos;s even a glimpse of the mysterious Casino Plumins tooling around in his Zigulis. There are many more, but they all present a cross-section of Latvia and, as the title suggests, find themselves at the crossroads as a dying empire takes its last gasps. Their lives are filled with chaos and pathos. Aldis, the stone mason preacher, keeps mouthing homilies about the spiritual life while in constant pursuit of earthly rewards. Julis finds himself lost in this new chaotic world, not nostalgic for the past, but resentful at having to live in a world in which a taxi driver no longer has the same status as his enterprising stonemason neighbor. Then there is poor Daiga who, despite it all, keeps smiling through the tears. Jaunie laiki Skersiela revisits the neighborhood 10 years later. Nothing is the same and at the same time it all seems strangely familiar. Daiga, the helpless young woman, is now a mother with a 10-year-old son. The house from which she was kicked out is now entirely hers and she is busy making it into her little safe haven. She has a job and a man and a healthy and happy son. She is strong and vibrant and in full control of her life. Aldis is still as devout as ever, if not more so, but his business has fallen on hard times. Racketeers have burned down his modern workshop and he now has to fight for control over his property with Galina, his father&apos;s second wife. Daiga has just turned off his water, water which he has been poaching off her pipes for his workshop all of those years. Peteris and Olga are still making horseradish in the back yard and bickering in loving fashion. And Casino Plumins is now tooling around in a brand new Mercedes and living in a house right out of the pages of Architecture Digest with his beautiful artist wife. A lot of old shacks on Crossroad Street are being torn down or remodeled and rebuilt. There is also a huge new addition to Crossroad Street: a mansion built by a mysterious and wealthy gypsy. Side by side we see modest, well-kept family homes with tidy gardens and run-down buildings with junk-filled yards. Times have changed mostly for the better, but in some ways for the worse. Latvia is independent and people have freedom to take control of their lives. But there is still chaos and uncertainty. People are rebuilding, but the first thing everyone seems to put around their property is a sturdy fence. An abandoned freight train rests on the nearby railroad tracks. Everyone has to duck and walk under if they want to get to the store. Osis now receives his disability pension in lats and not rubles, but it is still barely enough to get by and perhaps even less than it was before. Tolik&apos;s health has taken a turn for the worse. And Casino Plumins, despite all of his wealth, seems sad and lost and hungry for something that he just can&apos;t reach. The magic of Skersiela and Jaunie laiki Skerrsiela is that they allow us an entry into these peoples&apos; lives. It&apos;s an honest look that neither glamorizes nor minimizes real life -- real life as lived by real people in extraordinary times.",

      "reviewBody": "Lake Victory is a dead place after the tragic events with the invasion of prehistoric flesh-eaters piranhas. \n\nIn Cross Lake, Merkin County, the greedy Chet (David Koechner) opens The Big Wet Water Park against the will of his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker). When the van of her friends Travis (Paul James Jordan) and Ashley (Meagan Tandy) is found in the water and the couple is missing, Maddy and her friend Shelby (Katrina Bowden) miss them and they talk on a wooden deck on the lake; out of the blue, they are attacked by piranhas. \n\nMaddy visits the specialist in piranhas Mr. Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) with her former school friend Barry (Matt Bush), who works at The Big Wet, and with her former boyfriend, Deputy Kyle (Chris Zylka), and they discover piranhas in the lake. However Chet refuses to shutdown his water park and soon his costumers are under the attack of the fearful piranhas.\n\nI saw &quot;Piranha 3DD&quot; on DVD and I found it a gross and funny B-Movie, with stupid but hilarious characters. The director knows the B-movie formula, with teats and beautiful girls. Christopher Lloyd has become stereotyped as the mad scientist in American comedies in the end of his career. The uncredited Ving Rhames afraid of the water and shooting with his leg is comical. But David Hasselhoff steals the movie making fun of himself as the most famous lifeguard of all times. If you shutdown your brain, you will certainly enjoy this movie. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Piranha 2&quot; (&quot;Piranha 2&quot;)",

Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge, and Nudity. The &quot;extreme violence&quot; struck my fancy. The movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick. It had one or two gory scenes but I&apos;ve seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course the amount of gore in a movie isn&apos;t all that counts, right? You have plot also. Well, the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it. Don&apos;t rent it. I speak the truth. I can&apos;t imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say: &quot;I&apos;m gonna rent that again.&quot; It had it&apos;s moments where it kept you going but I&apos;m never going to see that film again.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve not seen anyone depict better the bittersweet relationship between a spoiled child and his patient grandmother than Korean director Lee Jeong-Hyang&apos;s ` The Way Home.&apos; Nothing spectacular happens during seven-year-old Sang-woo&apos;s visit to grandmother&apos;s home in a rural village after his single mother drops him off.  Changes occur, albeit predictably; the glory is in the small matters that will matter much to the boy as he matures long after the visit.\n\nWhy won&apos;t this film make it big if I like it so much? Well, the kid kills no one, smokes nothing, and speaks in child language, so audiences might just yawn.  Additionally, the boy is a poor actor who hasn&apos;t been directed well. But grandma, now there is an actress. Kim Eul-boon was discovered in her native village, 78 years old and never seen a movie! Hunched over, skin leathery and crinkled, expressions minimalist, she embodies the infirmities of old age and the resolution of a tough spirit to care for herself and other ancient neighbors to the last breath. Her grandson, abusive and self-centered, is just another person to care for who she knows is worth saving, in unconditional love probably unacceptable to aggressive Americans.\n\nWhen grandson plays with neighbor kids, he learns about the life&apos;s dangers by experiencing the menacing bull regularly chasing them down a particular stretch of necessary road.  When he longs for the companionship of a neighbor girl, he learns you have to work at love.  When he looks for grandma&apos;s love, he finds it in her smallest gestures, like buying and cooking him a chicken she thinks he wants when all he really wants is KFC.\n\nAnd so this country life goes on with the boy erratically moving from resentment to love and back again in an endlessly ambivalent cycle. The batteries he uses up for his electronic games serve as metaphor for his city life&apos;s wasteful and empty energy.\n\nThe semi-modern buses coming to and from the market also serve as emblems of the tenuous relationship between city and province, grandmother and daughter, grandmother and grandson.  So real is the slow and unglamorous rural life that you know Hyang has understood accurately that life and love are served slowly through its minor moments.\n\nI guarantee you will never forget the charismatic grandmother outfitted as a lowly peasant-she is a survivor and one hell of an actress. The film is dedicated to all grandmothers.  `Here&apos;s looking at you, Kid.&apos;"

Actually, I liked it immediately and, therefore, I return to it willingly...though I wouldn&apos;t really rank it among their top films! Still, for being the studio&apos;s only stab at the werewolf legend, the plot is pretty stacked with fanciful lore which differs quite a bit from what Universal came up with in the 30s and 40s...or, for that matter, anything that we&apos;ve seen since! Truth be told, it&apos;s highly improbable and even rather silly but, then, the film is so thick with atmosphere throughout (belying the typical low budget) that it doesn&apos;t matter at all! Oliver Reed essays his most significant starring role for Hammer with dignity and a brooding quality, in my opinion, and the supporting cast does pretty well by their roles but, again, the film&apos;s main asset is its beautiful look (including the wonderful werewolf make-up). I also don&apos;t mind the fact that we see the fully-fledged transformation only once as the build-up to it is terrific and the film, on the whole, emerges as one of Fisher&apos;s most assured efforts.",

The rest of the cast is good, too, but for me the main interest was to see a film where the actors (Mehmood &amp; Kumar) do their own playback singing, which I believe became fairly uncommon after the 1940s. These guys deliver, and steal the show whenever they are on screen. Then on top of that, Kishore&apos;s character, Guru, after Bhola (Dutt) hilariously demonstrates that he can&apos;t learn to sing, pulls a Cyrano and provides the voice for Bhola&apos;s picturizing. Then song duel with Masterji, too much, Guru working Bhola like puppet. Guru&apos;s troupe (including Bhola) are a gang of 5, working like a chorus, double-takes timed to the music. The scene where they go to Bhola&apos;s uncle to change his mind about his engagement is structured as a pretty much a cappella song. I love that. I chose this film to see Kishore work, and I feel like I picked a good one, plus I learned about Mehmood, I&apos;m looking forward to seeing more of both of them.",

      "reviewBody": "For those of us who saw this decidedly minor film on its initial release during the fall of 1955, there were several shockers early on in the brief 73 minute film, which was used to round out the second half of a double bill in less than prestigious theatres. First, as Mickey Rooney (who is supposed to look considerably younger than he does) journeys to a small out of the way cowtown (he&apos;s an idealistic frontier preacher), even the youngest among us burst out in laughter when we see an airplane in the sky. What we were too naive to know at the time was that on low budget features like this, there was only enough time, budget, and film stock for one take - so if something like a plane happened to fly by in clear sight of the camera, it ended up in the finished film. Moments later, when Mickey did arrive, there supercool but also supersleazy owner of the saloon was played by none other than . . . the same man who incarnated wholesome teetoltaler Wyatt Earp on TV every Tuesday night, Hugh O&apos;Brian. Eventually, we settled down to enjoy this mild oater in which Mickey wins over Hugh in good time and the sinful saloon gives way to a nice church. Undemanding in all respects, this film will be most enjoyed, if and when it shows up on some nostalgic movie channel or VHS/DVD, by those of us who loved it, all flaws aside, way back when.",

It&apos;s especially funny (and biting on occasion) if you happened to have lived through the first rush of AIDS deaths and the fear that engendered. This whole movie is a send up of that, and revels in the idea that sex and life go on even in the aftermath of terror. The Hoe-down fantasy sequence with its overtones of Busby Berkley and Oklahoma is hysterically funny. As for the acting, it&apos;s purposely broad with Patrick Steward playing against type, both in his role of Picard and in his many Shakespearean ones. Steve Weber is a hoot and there is no doubt in my mind that the other actors had a blast working in this flick. Many of them appear to have that &quot;look&quot; you see when actors are performing for their peers and enjoying every moment of it. The Pink Panthers moment alone lets Stewart shine. Are there flaws in the movie. Yup! The dialogue is sometimes stilted and jokes occasionally are dumped in rather than flowing from the plot, but overall it&apos;s witty, biting, and downright rapier-like on more than one occasion. All in all, Jeffrey is fun and worth an hour or so of your life.",

They are correct -- it is -- and yet, who cares?  It&apos;s utterly wonderful!\n\nThe whole cast is superb -- charming, desperate, vulnerable John Barrymore; cynical, sad, appealing Joan Crawford; pathetic, whining, irrepressible Lionel Barrymore; coarse, selfish, all-too-humanly cruel Wallace Beery; and of course, the great Greta Garbo.  The supporting cast, led by Lewis Stone and Jean Hersholt, are equally good.\n\nThose who criticize Garbo as over-the-top in her portrayal of the prima ballerina are right.  She IS over-the-top, AND she is absolutely glorious, whether wallowing in self-pitying, suicidal despair or radiant as the spring with a new love which astonishes and transports her.  What a unique, unforgettable screen presence!  What a Goddess!\n\n&quot;Grand Hotel&quot; holds this viewer, anyway, entranced from beginning to end. In addition to the superlative acting, the art deco design is stunning and the music always appropriate.\n\nCreaky?  You bet.  Do they make movies like this anymore?  Nope.  Do I wish they did?  I sure do."

      "reviewBody": "In a dysfunctional family headed by a neurotic, depressive and abusive milkman Far (Jesper Asholt), eleven year old Allan (Jannik Lorenzen) stills beholds his father as a role model, unable to grasp the destructive influence he has on other household members. Far terrorises the family with his insecurity, forcibly seeking affirmation of his worth. His mother Sanne (Julie Kolbech) hides away inside from Far&apos;s incessant sobbing preferring to take sleeping pills than to comfort her hysterical husband, while older brother Asger (Thomas Knuth-Winterfeldt) has escaped the house and enjoying his student life. Allan tries his best to keep his father happy, nagging his sister Mor (Hanne Hedelund) to do that thing, that she does to keep father away for him suicidal tendencies. Finally he discovers that Far is inwardly joyous whenever he has the opportunity to deliver riveting eulogies, thus tempting Allan to enter a murderous spree to supply his father with eulogies. Allan, still not old enough to see through the manipulative behaviour does the most dastardly deeds out of an innocent belief in his father&apos;s greatness.\n\nSet in 1970s Danish countryside the story about an abusive patriarch takes a wicked turn into a coming-of-age story dabbling with dry humour, but the subject matter including incest and physical abuse grinds uncomfortably with the the tone of the film. Seemingly light the dark entrails make it a troublesome watch, as it jars with a dramatic contradiction. Narratively loose it also fails to truly develop the story, leaving it somewhat hanging in oblivion making it feel somewhat dragging and exerting your patience at times. Performances are well-rounded, set in the quirkiness of characters, but as the movie goes I found myself disinterested in their development as the story obviously lacks focus, throwing dramatic tantrums, instead of building on the material.",

      "name": "Below average Spaghetti/Paella/Butifarra Western shot in Spain with usual genre secondary stars",
      "reviewBody": "Amusing but disconcerting Macarroni/Tortilla or Gazpacho Western with plenty of action , crossfire , brawls , double-crosses , twists and loads of shots . Butifarra Western realized in laughable style with a screenplay written by the prolific Ignacio F Iquino , including amusing dialogue , silly situations , plot twists and turns . Spanish production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , action , exaggerated characters , crossfire and lots of shots and fights . The movie is running out of ideas a bit , but it has some nice moments here and there . It deals with three nasty robbers , 3 burly brothers called Bud (Cris Huerta) , Ray (Ricardo Palacios) , Charles (Tito García) that want to take an amount of money . As they assault a bank , but along the way kidnap a gorgeous girl , Sheila (Margit Kocsis) , who results to be the sheriff&apos;s (Daniel Martin) &apos;s girlfriend. Shortly after , the three villain but likeable bandits face off new enemies as Brian (Manuel Barrios) and being relentless pursued by two Marshals , Alan Whitman (Daniel Martín) and the senior Carrigan (Gustavo Re) .\n\n Hilarious tortilla Western in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style in which three drifters carry out several adventures , hold-up a bank , kidnapping a beatiful girl , aboard a train , brawls and resolve a conflict among them , being mercilessly chased by two sheriffs . Along the way take place a lot of fights , punches , hits , slaps and kick-asses . This stirring tortilla/Ravioli Western packs thrills , shootouts , noisy action , humor with tongue-in-cheek and riding pursuits . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product , though this ¨None of the Three Were Called Trinity ¨ or &quot;Ninguno de los tres se llama Trinidad&quot; has penchant for hilarious happenings , as if you like comical westerns remains lightly watchable . Spanish production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , assaults , exaggerated characters , gun-down , lots of shots and fights . Given the peculiar economics of the Spanish industry there was a great deal of freedom for how to make satisfying movies for an ample export audience . Unfortunately, many of the 400-500 films made during this cycle were poorly made . It is a ridiculous tortilla Western in which ¨Fat Brothers of Trinity¨ resolve a conflict among them when they take a bank cash .   The film packs comical elements in charge of the peculiar and fatty trio : Chris Huerta , Ricardo Palacios and Tito Garcia , including tongue-in-cheek , gun-play , and turns to be amusing but embarrassing .There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . It&apos;s an absurd western with silly showdown betwee protagonists and their pursuers . It can be considered the ¨swan-song¨ of the Paella/Tortilla or Chorizo Western , that&apos;s why it is one of last films shot in Western town in ¨Splugues De Llobregat¨ where during the 60s and70s had been filmed hundreds of Westerns , as the unfortunate owner , the known producer/director Alfonso Balcazar went bankrupt and had to sell the terrains . The cast and support cast are passable . It stars Daniel Martin , a no much known actor who played several Spaghettis, such as : ¨Fistful of Dollars¨, ¨Valley of the Dancing Widows¨, ¨The last of the Mohicans¨, ¨7 guns for Timothy¨ , ¨Colmillo Blanco¨,¨Judas... ¡toma tus monedas! ¨, ¨Let&apos;s go and Kill sartana¨, among others . As sympathetic acting by starring trio , the fatty usually secondaries : Tito Garcia , Cris Huerta , Ricardo Palacios. And three beautiful girls : Fanny Grey , Margit Kocsis , Judy Collins . Here appear important secondaries from Spaghetti/Tortilla or Paella Western , these are the followings : Gustavo Re , Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González , Juan Torres , and Cesar Ojinaga . \n\n The picture being regularly photographed by Antonio L. Ballesteros hijo , though is necessary a fine remastering because the film-copy is washed-out . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga , (Huesca) , similar to Almeria , and a Western village located in ¨Splugues De Llobregat¨ , it resulted to be the location where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J.J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch , Xavier Marchal , Manuel Esteba , Ignacio F. Iquino , and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the Fraga landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many professional technicians and ordinary assistant direction and regular production design by José Rovira , he creates a passable scenario . Anti-climatic musical score by Enrique Escobar , including some songs sung by John Campbell . \n\n This was the sequel to ¨Los fabulosos de Trinidad¨ (1972) directed by Ignacio F Iquino with similar cast as Fanny Grey , Cris Huerta , Ricardo Palacios and Richard Harrison .The motion picture was poorly produced by Ignacio F Iguino , ¨IFI¨, and lousily directed by Pedro Ramírez who was an expert on comedy , filming vehicles for the Spanish comic named Jose Luis Ozores such as ¨ El Gafe¨, ¨El Tigre Chamberi¨, ¨Los Ladrones Somos Gente Honrada¨, ¨Recluta con Niño¨ and made a Horror : ¨School of death¨ and two Chorizo Western for Alfonso Balcázar and Ignacio Iquino : ¨Judas Toma Tus monedas¨, and &quot;None of the Three Were Called Trinity&quot; .",

      "reviewBody": "One day in South Africa in the 1960&apos;s, a young black man was walking along the street with his aged mother.  Coming along the road was a young white man.  The young black man knew that apartheid law and custom meant that the white would probably barge the two blacks off the pavement and into the gutter. The law would protect him and the young black man might be imprisoned for defending himself.  The young black man tensed his muscles and prepared to defend his mother, but was amazed when the Englishman stepped off the pavement and doffed his broad brimmed hat in greeting. Later on the two would become friends and allies.  The white man was to become bishop Trevor Huddleston, the black man, bishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nThat story is NOT the story of A Dry White season, but it is of a kindred spirit.  Like the gesture of Trevor Huddleston, the story of Ben de Tor is a gesture against apartheid.  A glimmer of hope, but merely that, a flicker.\n\nIt must be five years since I saw a Dry White Season but I still remember how I felt leaving the cinema.  It is a film which will stay with you.\n\nThe plot follows a white South African on an adventure through bewilderment, revelation, denial, disgust, and a futile attempt to fight a grossly unfair system.\n\nI can&apos;t go into detail after this length of time but the cameos in this film would be worth the video rental.  Marlon Brando (yes) steals the show as the lawyer who knows exactly how hopeless the fight against apartheid is but agrees to fight anyway.\n\nThe political situation today in South Africa is a world away from that of A Dry White Season.  Watch it and never forget.",

      "reviewBody": "In Miami, during the presentation of the Yankee Clippers, the wolf band leader and pilot Roger Bond (Gene Raymond) flirts with the guest Belinha de Resende (Dolores Del Rio) and the stringent hotel manager fires them. However, the band is hired for the opening night of the Atlântico Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and they need to fly to Brazil. \n\nWhen Roger meets Belinha in the hall of the hotel, he learns that she lost her flight to Rio and he offers a ride for her in his plane. Roger is forced to land in an island and he immediately fixes the mechanical problem in the plane; however, he lies to Belinha and tells that he can not fix the problem just to spend the night alone with her. But Belinha, who is the fiancée of the Brazilian Júlio, resists to his harassment and later she finds another plane to fly to Rio. \n\nOnce in Rio, the infatuated Roger meets his friend Júlio without knowing that he is the fiancé of Belinha, and he tells about his love for the woman. When the Yankee Clippers are ready to open the hotel, powerful bankers that are interested to force the bankruptcy of the Atlântico&apos;s owner to take the hotel, send the police since he does not have the permit to anticipate the opening day. However, Roger&apos;s friend and musician Fred Ayres (Fred Astaire) proposes an airborne show to the guests. Meanwhile, the brokenhearted Roger decides to return to his country and leave Belinha with Júlio.\n\n&quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; is the debut of the pair Fred and Ginger in minor support roles. The sappy and naive romance has the Mexican Dolores Del Rio performing a Brazilian sassy woman and Gene Raymond in the lead roles. The footages from Rio de Janeiro in the 30&apos;s and the airborne show are the best moments of this film. The funniest thing in &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; is that there is no Brazilian actor or actress in the cast. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Voando para o Rio&quot; (&quot;Flying to Rio&quot;)",

However only myself and a few others have seen this film in it&apos;s entirety as it is generally believed lost. It is a fantastic film in that one can truly see how Riefenstahl was developing her unique documentary style which would later result in Triumph of the Will, Day of Freedom Our Armed Forces and finally Olympia I and II. Sadly this film will probably never be released to the general public as it is heavily protected by the German Federal Archives and rights are administered through Transit Film Munich. Rating? Three of Five Stars!"

      "reviewBody": "In the harrowing, Oscar-nominated Canadian drama &quot;War Witch,&quot; a young African girl is conscripted into a band of armed rebels, ordered by them to kill her own parents, then forced, along with the other children in her village, to fight against the government forces they&apos;re opposing. Because she seemingly has some sort of psychic visions of where the enemy is hiding in the woods (it&apos;s actually hallucinations brought on by a psychotropic liquid she imbibes from some local plants), she earns the position of personal &quot;witch&quot; to the chief rebel himself - a position that brings with it special protection as well (at least up to a point). But that&apos;s only the beginning of Komona&apos;s ordeal as she hooks up with an albino &quot;magician&quot; (the excellent Serge Kanyinda) with whom she tries to flee the horrors of the world around them.\n\nAnd it is those very horrors - the nonstop terror and violence, and the ever present prospect of sudden death - that writer/director Kim Nguyen captures to such powerful effect in this film. Despite its occasional forays into the surreal, what one takes away most from &quot;War Witch&quot; is its unflinching willingness to confront the brutal realities of life for Komona and the countless others who share her predicament. Then there are the occasional acts of random kindness that allow hope to flourish even in the most horrible of circumstances.\n\nAnd all throughout her ordeal, Komona must find a way to bury, both literally and figuratively, the ghosts of the parents she killed.\n\nRachel Mwanza is utterly amazing as Komona, and she richly deserved all the praise and awards heaped on her for her performance. Whether it&apos;s her heartbreaking narration to her unborn child or the understated way in which she reacts to and internally processes the unspeakable atrocities she both witnesses and is forced to commit, Mwanza embodies a much larger tragedy within the narrower confines of a single character.\n\nIt may be hard to watch at times, but &quot;War Witch&quot; provides an invaluable reminder of what happens when we send our children off to war.",

      "name": "Acceptable Paella/Spaghetti Western about a band of  Bushwackers  led by Bill Anderson who commit robberies and killings",
      "reviewBody": "Spanish/Italian co-production about some ex-Confederate soldiers form a bloody band led by Bill Anderson (Armando Calvo) and his bandits (familiar faces from Chorizo Western as Luis Barboo, Jose Jaspe , Frank Braña , Alfonso De La Vega) , they have frightened the region of Springfield with continuous robberies . They are a little-known band of Civil War fighters known as Bushwhackers . They skirmish then spend long hours hiding . Therefore the authorities (Angel Menendez , Jesus Puente, Miguel Del Castillo) and Sheriff (Antonio Pica) decide to seek help from the Pinkerton detective agency . Besides, on the little town appears Ringo (usual Spaghetti hero Peter Martell), an ex-captain in the army of the north , who also goes behind the band . But Ringo receives unexpected help from rogue Dan Samuelson (habitual nasty , though here playing an agreeable character , Piero Lulli) to achieve their goal , which is simply to try to stop the band before they are caught and hanged by the law, as Allan wants to achieve especially apprehend Kidd (Paolo Hertz), the youngest member of the outlaws , so both join forces, the trouble is that maybe he is found that can end badly . Exciting film based on historical events set during post American Civil War (1861-1865) in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge, they made a violent raid into Kansas , taking place the famous Lawrence Massacre , carried out by Bill Anderson and Quantrill . \n\nThis meaty Western contains an interesting but twisted plot , thrills , action , double-crosses , violence , shoot&apos;em up and results to be quite entertaining . But overall Ringo the Lone Rider&quot; or &quot;Two Brothers, One Death&quot; is entertaining to watch , with some good moments, and against the backdrop of aftermath American Civil War that gives more firmness to the story . The movie deals with historical events and characters such as the Bushwhackers who are irregulars loyal to the South led by Bill Anderson and also appears the notorious Pinkerton Agency . It is also remarkable violence executed by band Bill , who doesn&apos;t care to kill some poor and peaceful Mormons to achieve their goals . The picture efficiently describes the atmosphere of violence in which was set the post Civil War dealing with fights between Bushwhackers versus Jayhawkers . It&apos;s a moving western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist , Peter Martell and Piero Lulli against Anderson band formed by customary Spanish secondaries such as Armando Calvo , Jose Jaspe , Alfonso De La Vega and Frank Braña . Nice production design creating an evocative scenario with luminous outdoors , mountains , rocky grounds under a shinning sun and fine sets by Cubero and Galicia from Colmenar Viejo , Madrid, La Pedriza , and Hoyo de Manzanares&apos;s Western-film town . Atmospheric and thrilling musical score in Spaghetti style by Manuel Parada , including a catching leitmotif . \n\nThe motion picture was well written and produced by ordinary Eduardo Manzanos Brochero ; being professionally directed and in his own personal style by Rafael Romero Marchent . Rafael Romero Marchent was born on May 3, 1926 in Madrid, Spain. He is a director and actor, known for Garringo, Un Dolar de Recompensa , or Manos Torpes . Rafael Romero Marchent was brother of Joaquin Luis Romero , who was the first to shoot Westerns in Spain . At first, Rafael Romero began in films as an actor, but when his career began to wane, he preferred to spend time behind the camera . Rafael is an expert writer and director of Spaghetti Western as proved in ¨Two crosses on Danger Pass¨, Cry for revenge¨, ¨Two guns for two twins¨ and ¨Sartana Kills Them All¨ or ¨Un par Asesinos¨. While his brother Joaquin Marchent is deemed the Paella Western&apos;s best director , his first film was ¨El Coyote¨ and the sequel titled ¨Revenge of Coyote¨ shot in Mexico ; after that , he filmed ¨The shadow of Zorro¨ and ¨Revenge of Zorro¨, he went go directing Western as ¨ Riding to death ¨ , ¨Adventures in the West¨ , ¨Three good men¨, ¨Sabor Venganza ¨ and the most popular and violent ¨Condenados a Vivir¨ . Plus , he wrote for his brother Rafael Romero Marchent the followings Western : ¨Manos Torpes¨, ¨Ocaso Un Pistolero¨ , ¨Garringo¨ , ¨Dos Cruces en Danger Pass¨ and ¨Sartana Kills Them All¨. Rating : Passable and decent S.W. , though contains some flaws and gaps ; however , it results to be entertaining .",

He delivers an extremely convincing performance which is, arguably, his very best. It is too bad that this movie is as obscure as it is, because if it had been produced state-side and been more mainstream, he might have enjoyed a much more critically-acclaimed career, deserving of a lifetime achievement Academy Award.  However, this is not the case and die-hard Bronson fans get to enjoy this little gem while the rest of the world misses out because they were too busy shunning the unfairly typecast Bronson.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very good movie that I would recommend for anyone, especially those with a family. It has action elements to keep the men entertained and a plot touching enough to make those same testosterone filled men blubber like babies.\n\nBasically the premise is simple, Heather, a young lady played by the enchanting Jennifer Love Hewitt (called simply Love Hewitt in the credits) lives with her stepmother after her birth father passed away. She longs to meet her biological mother so she is forced to run away from home. The stepmother then hires a detective to find her for a large reward. The plot thickens when the stepmother tries to double cross the detective and save the reward money leading to both Heather and the newly hired detective being on the lamb together.\n\nThe character development is good, but not great. The characters are mostly two dimensional. The step mother is the typical wicked kind, the FBI agents are stereotypically bumbling throughout. Also the detectives business associate is the typical tightwad. Fortunately the important roles more than make up for the supporting cast.\n\nHoward Hesseman makes a wonderful if not formulaic grouch and Love Hewitt is so adorable you&apos;ll like the movie just because she&apos;s in it. Their characters start out with a lot of animosity which is to be expected, only to find that they are more alike than meets the eye.\n\nThe ending isn&apos;t surprising, and the movie flows smoothly along without any unexpected twists. There is a story to de told and the director wisely left the twists out instead focusing on the stars, keeping everything else to a minimum. Not every movie can pull this off, but in this case Hewitt and Hessman are all you care about, so more would have been just that, more. I&apos;m not going to give away too much but that you will leave feeling better for having seen it.",

It has a wonderful cast, an acclaimed screenwriter and even a Marvin Hamlisch score. The film was billed as almost an older version of &apos;The Bone Collector&apos;. But it seems more like a serial killer version of &apos;Moonstruck&apos;. I can see why many people were disappointed in the film. They saw the movie from a totally different angle. The serial killer (the January man) is almost ancillary to the actual plot of the movie. It is a Kevin Kline driven vehicle with a old and new love interest(Sarandon &amp; Mastrantonio). It has the re-reinstatement of a hero cop who takes a fall from grace for his brother (Harvey Keitel)and is banished from the police department and is relegated to fighting fires rather than criminals. It has the cro-magnon police captain (Aiello) and the even older Mayor(Steiger). All these pieces of the puzzle come together to provide decent little film which I think is clearly misunderstood.",

      "name": "Tom Waits as a Punch &amp; Judy puppeteer.  almost enough said, but there&apos;s more",
      "reviewBody": "This is a semi-forgotten film that got advertised largely by the presence of Tom Waits. This isn&apos;t unnatural since he was the most recognizable face in the film - there are a couple of character actors from Britain, Bill Paterson and Alex Norton, who have appeared in many things, and Charlotte Coleman - but the film was (or, if it is at all today, continues to be) sold on Waits, and of course he is the major reason to see the film. This doesn&apos;t mean to say the movie is *bad*, and it actually is enjoyable and engaging in parts. The main problem at the script level is that the two filmmakers don&apos;t know how to keep the tonal glue together, and not even Waits&apos; cool can save that.\n\nThis is a movie that reminds me a little of something from Guy Ritchie (especially those bits where the two gangsters argue about crabs and shellfish and such nonsense in the car) or Roeg/Camell&apos;s Performance where a criminal on the run due to gambling debts takes a job as an &quot;Entertainer&apos;s Assistant&quot; and becomes part of the work of a young mute woman, Laura, and the man who does the Punch &amp; Judy puppet show for local kids, Silva, played by Waits. It&apos;s a scattershot kind of story, in ways both good and not so good, but it&apos;s all anchored by Waits&apos; performance. I wish I could tell you Damon Lowry (uh, who?) brings the goods as well, but he&apos;s only &apos;fine&apos; as one might say. The other performers only bring so much, i.e. one actor you can tell is a bad guy due to a ponytail.\n\nMatter of fact, without him in it and how he has a very particular physicality (watch how he can as an actor inhabit a space so seemingly with little effort and slink about an actress like the one playing Ms J in a scene) and that voice, which is truly distinctive, this movie wouldn&apos;t be very memorable at all. What the filmmakers are trying to do is what the title suggests, create a &apos;fairy-tale&apos; out of a story that has a lot of elements of crime and the underworld and seedy things like violence and rape (that second thing comes out of *nowhere* in the story, simply as a plot device for Johnny that could have been done in a more clever or less typical way). They aren&apos;t at all poor directors and in fact have a good sense of where to put the camera and locations and where to set the scene. It&apos;s at the script where things feel... odd and unresolved at points. Think like if Guy Ritchie during his crime movie hey-day only put in half the work that was needed.\n\nAnd yet, while the whole never quite comes together and a certain &quot;twist&quot; that really isn&apos;t doesn&apos;t work at all involving a character&apos;s supposed death, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Again a good lot of this comes down to being a fan of Waits and how he clearly took what was a fairly standard &quot;cool&quot; guy on paper and made him... legitimately cool, and that he can be in a leather jacket and smoke a cigarette but that isn&apos;t what does the acting for him, it&apos;s him and his soul and what he is as a person. If the rest of the story and the cast rose up to his level then this would be more highly regarded today. But it&apos;s not so here we are with an obscurity that is seeing another light of day due to Amazon Prime.",

Which is I think what happens with this one.\n\nSo if you dig the idea, you may feel way more excited about this, then if you just thought it was a generic Science Fiction movie (from the US or UK to name but two). Of course having good actors in this does help too. The story has enough twists and tweaks to keep you guessing where it will end up (or is it start?) ... just sit back, relax and let this wash over you ... in a good sense of course.",

      "name": "Another masterpiece by Resnais",
      "reviewBody": "It starts with a series of tracking shots, the camera manoeuvring through the vast interior of a Baroque château, lingering over the beautiful, austere marble work, the polished, imposing mirrors, the elaborate, monstrous chandeliers that dangle from the ceiling. The music is ominous. The camera and the audience, much like the characters, will never leave this hotel. Sometimes, the illusion of outdoors can be toyed with: the hotel&apos;s garden is vast, complete with fountains, labyrinthine hedge mazes and pathways surrounded by pyramidal trees and classical statues – but we will never leave.\n\nThe narration, by a man known only as X, is fragmented, repetitive, as though we are only hearing its echoes bouncing off the walls, with some of it inevitably lost to the stone and marble, much like the conversation that fills the château. We see that there are a number of guests at this hotel, but we never learn why they are there: indeed, it becomes quite clear that not even they are sure.\n\nLast Year In Marienbad is a difficult film. Its ambiguity and frustrating lack of any kind of plot has mystified many and angered more. It isn&apos;t a film that can be analysed in any definite sense, because the film is open to various interpretations. That is a good thing. One thing that can be said in all certainty is that wherever this hotel is, it does not exist on Earth. Perhaps some parallel universe, or the afterlife (the assumption that the characters are dead is a completely valid interpretation of the film, and the only interpretation that allows for the film to be understood in a literal sense).\n\nOtherwise, the film is a metaphor from the opening titles to the final fade to black. Of what? You&apos;ll have to decide for yourself. Much like Resnais&apos; previous film, Hiroshima Mon Amour, here emotional paralysis, guilt, memory and death are all integral themes. The château is more like a mausoleum than a getaway – its icily geometric perfection is at once awe inspiring and frightening, otherworldly (many critics have pondered over a master image in the hotel garden after A rushes out onto the balcony, followed by the camera, to be confronted by a tableau in which the couples cast long elongated shadows on the ground, but the trees do not). It is cold, impersonal – emotion is something that cannot be sustained there. The characters constantly talk in monotones, speaking about nothing (the weather seems to be a popular topic), settling into comfortable routines where banal trivialities are the highlights of the day. A man who may or may not be A&apos;s jealous husband is an expert at &apos;Nim&apos; – a game of logic hasn&apos;t been so disquieting since Max Von Sydow donned a suit of armour and played chess with the Grim Reaper! It is an insipid existence, disrupted only by X&apos;s pursuit of A – a beautiful woman with whom X insists he had an affair with last year, and who he begs to run away with him. A rebukes him, refusing to remember him, and constantly dismisses him.\n\nMemory is a painful thing, so the characters manipulate it – A has forced herself to forget her lover, and X, consumed by guilt over a possible molestation, invents memories to sustain his self denial. Sacha Vierny, the cinematographer, makes effective use of very short flashbacks, inter cut with a conversation, to demonstrate a sudden flash of memory. The film simmers over with sexual tension, but there is no passion to be seen here: the movie is ice cold. Beauty and pose are faculties that these characters retain, but emotion is something they have lost. In Resnais&apos; first film, the couple are dead in the metaphorical sense, clinging to life by the fingernails by trying to sustain their love for one another, but doomed to fail. The same can be seen here – the man is desperate for an idealised romance with A, but A cannot accept.\n\nTemporal and spatial relationships in the film are hard to distinguish, as is truth from fiction, disorientating and confusing us; rooms and open spaces seem to metamorphose and change at their own will. The camera often jump-cuts from one room to another, while the conversation runs fluidly as normal between X and A. They are lost in a world of meandering, decaying memories, of fabrications and frightening, painful truths, now ambiguous and obscured by metaphorical cobwebs. We see them only as they do: distorted.\n\nWhen we see a film and do not understand it, we often become defensive and fall back on words like pretentious or self-indulgent to make up for our ignorance. If we cannot fully understand what is going on, perhaps we aren&apos;t meant to, in that sense. The visuals make up for it in any case – the film is like a glorious piece of artwork in motion from beginning to end, gorgeous but disturbing. It is a fascinating film – one that warrants more than a single viewing. Simply for its technical achievements in cinematography, its costume design (kudos to Coco Chanel) and the oppressive, sorrowful and disquieting, trance like atmosphere, it is iconic. It is, in short, a masterpiece meticulously restored and re-released by the BFI in the UK so it can be enjoyed once more on the big screen, where it belongs. A delight!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Proof&quot; hones in on the emotional relationships in the play. With Rebecca Miller jointly credited with David Auburn on adapting his play, this is less coy about who did what to whom when in reality or delusion than it is about connections between people. \n\nThe flashbacks cut effectively back and forth and smooth out where each character is coming from.\n\n&quot;Catherine,&quot; the daughter of a brilliant mathematician who is somewhat modeled on John Nash&apos;s struggles with madness which were portrayed in &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; is still the focal point of attention. But with the other characters fleshed out more Gwyneth Paltrow has more to naturalistically react to than the stage actresses (I saw it on Broadway with a mercurial Anne Heche). Paltrow brings unexpected fragility to the role and makes her sarcastic accusations to her sister come out of personal pain and not just spitefulness. You really see that she is emotionally ravaged from putting her life and mind on hold for a father with a very strong personality.\n\nAnthony Hopkins is unusually paternal as the father and you understand her attractions and fear of him, as well as why the sister had to flee how insecure she felt there, as Hope Davis manages to breathe some life into a strident character. We see very clearly the demands of being a caregiver to a legend. Unlike in &quot;Iris&quot; at the end of careers, we do ache at the sacrifices the young caregiver has made and how this claustrophobic existence has led to her own crippling doubts about her work, her life and her sanity.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is the hunkiest, most adorable, rock &apos;n&apos; rollin&apos; math graduate student since Matt Damon in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and could help increase math enrollments around the country. But as irresistible as he is, and their relationship is literally more believably fleshed out as young people than in the play, we also can share Paltrow&apos;s suspicion of him. But we see more of his activities, as the film opens up the play, so we too clearly know before she that he has regained in our credibility as he seeks his proof. I don&apos;t mind that the film adds to the romantic aspects and drawn out coda as I thought the play tempted unfulfillingly in that direction and it is a means to help her regain the multiple meanings of proof -- as evidence, as trust, as confidence. \n\nDirector John Madden keeps the camera moving actively during long dialog interchanges, reflecting &quot;Catherine&quot;s agitated state of mind. The house and academic setting well establish the atmosphere, particularly when there&apos;s more people around, though some of the outdoor shots seemed like filler. \n\nThe score is occasionally intrusive, but the concluding voice-over is even more annoying and unnecessary.",

Unfortunately, in &quot;Cane e Gatto&quot; there is no one else to support him or play off against him: Tomas Milian is an unfunny caricature of a self-assured gigolo who wears kitschy suits, drives a pink car and is dubbed with an overdone Italian accent, and Marc Lawrence is a less unfunny, but still unfunny, caricature of a Mafia don. This is slapdash (notice the rapid night-to-day change between the hotel scene and the chase that follows immediately afterwards), simple-minded film-making. ** out of 4, and that&apos;s very generous.",

      "reviewBody": "Traveling through Canada while filming the amusing short film &apos;The Railrodder&apos;, Buster Keaton is observed both on and off set in this little seen documentary. Though hardly the most loquacious entertainer, Keaton proves to be an interesting behind-the-camera personality as he debates whether certain scenes in &apos;The Railrodder&apos; are thrills or gags and as he shares anecdotes about celebrities such as Cecil B. DeMille. The documentary is a tad uneven a ride though (pun intended) as it pulls between focusing on Keaton backstage and recounting Keaton&apos;s childhood and initial rise to fame; fascinating a career as Keaton certainly had, the highlights of &apos;Rides Again&apos; are the scenes of Keaton conversing - and singing. There is also an overload of footage from &apos;The General&apos; interspersed throughout - no doubt to justify the title as Keaton also rides railway tracks in &apos;The Railrodder&apos; - but less footage from &apos;The General&apos; and more from the inventive likes of &apos;Sherlock Jr.&apos; may have worked better. Flawed as it may be though, &apos;Rides Again&apos; is an easy film to warm to. While clearly not as healthy and agile as in his prime, Keaton is enthusiastic as ever about finding ways to make his audiences laugh and the candid insight the film offers into his mind at work, always thinking up different ways to find humour in life, truly resonates.",

With minimal budgets of less than $200K, the movie has dealt with the themes of financial systems of this world. I think this is the only non English movie which presents an alternative view point about the loop holes of the present day financial system. A very thought provoking and bold movie. It could have been edgier but I give it to the team which came up with the idea of making a movie on Economic Hit men in Telugu language. The story has a very noir feel to it . VFX is decent and background score is amazing.",

      "reviewBody": "This film by 92-year-old Portuguese film director Manoel De Oliveira is an 86-minute close observation of an elderly actor who seems to be mainly a stage actor. The film opens with a 15-minute scene from Ionesco&apos;s &quot;Le roi meurt,&quot; in which the actor (Michel Piccoli) goes through the never-say-die speech of the 280-year-old king. After the performance, he is greeted backstage with the news that his wife, daughter, and son-in-law have been killed in a car accident. The rest of the film follows him in his everyday routines, into another performance (this time in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;), and then on to a film of James Joyce&apos;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot; In between we watch him buy shoes, quarrel with his agent, play with his orphaned grandson, and drink espresso at his favorite cafe.\n\nDe Oliveira has a habit of filming performances at odd levels. For example, in &quot;Le roi meurt,&quot; Piccoli has his back to the camera the entire time. During a quarrel with his agent, only Piccoli&apos;s feet in his new shoes are shown. He bashes the heels against the pavement when he&apos;s mad, rocks them back and forth when he&apos;s pleased--it&apos;s all there. When he is playing Buck Mulligan in &quot;Ulysses&quot; we only hear his performance, and gauge it by the reactions on the face of the film director (John Malkovich). The lengths De Oliveira goes to to confound his actors&apos; egos and the audience&apos;s expectations are inventive and a bit peculiar.\n\nI sensed that this film was more about De Oliveira than about the characters in the story. There isn&apos;t much dialog and not much character development. The theme of the king who will not die, who is egomaniacal beyond reason, perhaps is De Oliveira talking to himself. He makes movies into his 90s because it is his habit. He should be dead by now, but he&apos;s not, and because of that he has watched everyone he loves die before him. The possibility of trying to start a new life with a young starlet that is offered to Piccoli must also have happened to De Oliveira. He won&apos;t make himself ridiculous that way. &quot;I&apos;m not Casals,&quot; the actor says when told of the musician&apos;s marriage at the age of 82 to a teenager. I can hear our director saying that, too.\n\nWhat he wants to do is stop working, rest, and mourn his losses. This is, I feel, a personal film and all the more moving for it."

      "reviewBody": "At at the end of the American Civil War (1861-1865) a jobless band of robber soldiers commanded by a rebel Colonel (Ty Hardin) steal at a bank where the earnings to date of a tough bouty hunter called Acquasanta Joe (Lincoln Tate) are deposited. After that, the latter goes after them to retrieve his savings , but then things go wrong .\n\nThis run-of-the-mill spaghetti Western contains bank robbery, thrills , crossfire , explosion , treason, plot twists , crosses , double-crosses and brief doses of humor with tongue in cheek. So-so Spaghetti Western including regular ingredients as violent confrontation , shootouts , betrayals and with the novelty of an Union army cannon that a gang of cutthroats uses to get their purports . Stars Ty Hardin who can be remembered as a TV figure star in the Sixties as Bronco series (1958-1962) , from here he starred secondary roles in WWII films as PT 109 , Merrill&apos;s Marauders , Battle of Bugle . But he then emigrated to Italy to play some Spaghetti , warfares and Euro-thrillers . Unlike his fellow Clint Eastwood he didn&apos;t get successes and Ty became involved in B-films and routine Spaghettis , like this one . Equally , it stars Lincoln Tate , another failed American B-actor who also performed Spaghettis and other second-class films . Along with some familar faces from Pasta , Peplum or Euro-spy sub-genres, such as : Mario Novelli or Anthony Freeman , Alfredo Rizzo , Ferdinado Poggi co-writer too , Federico Boido or Rick Boyd . And , of course , Richard Harrison , co-director so well, he played lots of action movies , Westerns , Sword and Sandals and thrillers throughout a long career around forty years , starting in USA and, subsequently , mostly developed in Italy .\n\nThe motion picture was regularly directed by Mario Gariazzo , as it has several flaws , gaps , shortfalls and failures . Gariazzo was an Italian craftsman who wrote and directed all kinds of genres , such as : Sci-Fi : Brother from space , Eyes behind stars , Very Close Encounters of the fourth phase ; Terror : The Obsessed ; Erotic or Softcore : Erotic flash , Top Model, Sor Emmanuel , Play Motel ; Action : Il Carabinieri , Execution Squad , and Spaghetti Westerns : this Acquasanta Joe, Good will fogive my pistol , The Masked thief , Long day of massacre , Day of judgement also starred by Ty Hardin along with Rosalba Neri, Rossano Brazzi . Rating : 4.5/10. Below average . Only for Spaghetti Western aficionados.",

It fails on every level, and to see that it&apos;s described on IMDb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. I don&apos;t recall more than a couple of chuckles. There are more laughs in any episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously.\n\nToo much of the characters&apos; interaction just didn&apos;t seem to me to have any foundation, and was therefore very unlikely/unbelievable.\n\nIf it hadn&apos;t been for the almost-gratuitous bikini shots, well, what can I say?

About half of the characters (and thank God also the actors) are of German origin. Düringer is the big loser this time, and the Germans are the winners because they have the better humour, more money and wits. None of them is nice, all the characters are extremely exaggerated and extremely unlikeable.\n\nThe plot of the film is confusing, the editing impressively fast and the dialogues are full of wickedness.\n\nI&apos;m still not sure what to think of Poppitz but it&apos;s definitely Harald Sicheritz&apos;s best film and worth watching.",

A good one from the former Yugoslavia is Emir Kusturica&apos;s &quot;Otac na sluzbenom putu&quot; (&quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; in English).\n\nWhen Sarajevo man Mesa is arrested in 1950 for criticizing a cartoon, his wife Sena has to tell son Malik that the dad is on a business trip. As the movie progresses, Malik comes to understand the political status quo in this country straddling east and west.* Moreover, it becomes clear that Mesa is not the world&apos;s most responsible person, preferring to go screw attractive women to raising his son.\n\nOne thing is that I like seeing films about cultures that we rarely see. Beyond that, this look at political tensions - and how the boy has to learn about sex on his own - fascinates me. I definitely recommend the movie.\n\nPS: Emir Kusturica also directed &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (starring Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis and Faye Dunaway) in the United States) and &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; back in his native country.\n\n*Tito&apos;s disagreements with Stalin led to Yugoslavia&apos;s expulsion from the Eastern Bloc, so it aligned itself with the west but maintained an Eastern Bloc-style government.",

The boy grows up to be Roger Daltrey, and the film is about what happens to him and his parents (Ann-Margret &amp; Oliver Reed).\n\nThe performances, music, and the images are what made an impression on me. Tina Turner is unforgettable as the Acid Queen, who promises to make Tommy grow up. Ann-Margret is better than I ever remember her being; she got a Best Actress Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Roger Daltrey does well in his first movie. Jack Nicholson as The Specialist has a better voice than Marlon Brando. Oliver Reed&apos;s singing skills are debatable, but he acts the part well.\n\nThe music is good, especially Tina Turner, Ann-Margret&apos;s songs, and Elton John, who sings &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;.\n\nThe images that work--the ones I remember best; The Church of Marilyn Monroe, with her statue in the pose from &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955), when she stood above a subway grating and her skirt blew upward. The whole scene with Tina Turner. Ann-Margret dressed in white, in an all white room; Daltrey, singing in a church, with a cross as his microphone.\n\nThis would be a perfect film for TCM Underground, if it hasn&apos;t already been shown there.",

One after another, women who have spent their lives doing exactly what Jesus asked us to do, live the Beatitudes, spread the Word, keep God&apos;s laws, and see the face of Jesus in the poor and disenfranchised, shared their longing to be in the ordained ministry. For 1200 or more years after Christ died, there were women deacons, priests, and bishops. As patriarchal views became entrenched, women were no longer ordained, and to boot, word was spread that they never had been. Jules Hart, Director, is not a Catholic. But she felt so strongly that this movement within the Catholic Church should be spread that she spent her own money making the video to do so. In 2002 seven women were ordained by two bishops in Apostolic succession on a boat in the Danube. The next year, two other bishops consecrated 3 of them as bishops. There are now 200+ validly ordained Roman Catholic women priests. Patriarchal hierarchy will keep their stranglehold on power as long as possible, but the women are coming, and the Kin-dom will blossom.",

He rushes home but didn&apos;t have much plans or a business mind to take over, when he meets Genevieve Tobin, who is an heir to a competitor. In fact, there are several meat-packing companies, but they don&apos;t all use pure beef in their product/business. Edward&apos;s father did and their business was number one in the industry, in this film was takes place in 1892, just before Teddy Roosevelt becomes President.

Getting married to Genevieve Tobin, and using only prime beef, Eddie does take over, but the business does not do so well, just adequate and others become more successful. Meanwhile, a young aspiring opera singer (Kay Francis) looking for a backer comes to him, asking for capital as an investment. When he hears her sing and she knows his favorite song, &quot;Home on the Range,&quot; he obviously falls for her. But what he didn&apos;t realize was that she was what she was. She did form a fond attachment for him, but never claimed to love only him. She was a very cavalier lover. When he is inspired by her gusto to live life fully and go for the gold, he becomes ruthless in getting contracts for his business and in cutting costs, not always using premium beef, like everyone else. But in his getting fat deals, his food affects more people, more important people. So when the fit hits the shan, he is the scapegoat. Meanwhile, Genevieve learns about Kay and she lives for the day to show Edward up. This is a very well-made film that does not overdo its dramatics. In fact, this played out very well and was very realistic. While not a very important film or that great a film in the long run, it really delivers with great performances by all. This was not a turkey by no means, as Edward felt he was being thrown into them by the movie studio all the time. They were uninspired and repetitive to him, as he was a stage actor by heart. He never understood the appeal of &quot;Little Caesar,&quot; despite the fact it made him an overnight movie star. Playing a gangster was not all that it was hyped up to be, but this film he felt at least was &quot;about something,&quot; as he said in his autobiography. And, he had fond memories of Kay Francis. If you see this on TCM one day, watch and enjoy Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood&apos;s most versatile actors, who earned an Honorary Oscar for his performances of men in all walks of life.",

      "reviewBody": "I was deeply impressed by the artistic approach of &apos;When Elephants Were Young&apos; as it flashes no strong message but has an underlying tone of honesty and transparency that allows one to come to their own conclusion on the socio-economic importance of elephant businesses, in contrast to the goals of release. The stunning images provide a unique insight into Thai street life and urban-rural family challenges. The viewer is taken into landscapes and social contexts that are rarely seen, certainly by the tourist but also are less of a focus point for film makers. The build-up of the story surrounding one family in particular and their elephant is touching and one can easily imagine how many other families are experiencing the same conflict and choices across Thailand and beyond. This film is for anyone who wants to take a dive deeper to get to know individuals and real working stories. Highly recommended for the nature doc lover to those loving a good story."

      "reviewBody": "First off i want to start off by saying that i don&apos;t hate the prequels, in fact i thought that the prequels did a lot of good things (like expanding George Lucas&apos;s world and making it bigger and also creating a back story of the emperor and how anakin came to be Darth Vader) but i thought the acting was sub par and the dialogue could have been improved and cgi was an issue also. That being said all in all i enjoyed all 6 star wars movies because they were all unique in their own way and they always felt like star wars to me!!, but The FORCE AWAKENS falls short of this!!! I won&apos;t spoil this movie because there&apos;s nothing in this movie to spoil, Its an exact reboot of the originals except its not even as good!! going into this movie i knew it wasn&apos;t going to live up to the hype, but i didn&apos;t expect that this movie was going to copy and paste the plots of the original three movies. I also thought that the movie didn&apos;t make much sense, there were many plot holes that were not explained like the rise of the first order, why is the rebellion still resisting when they defeated the empire? And who is Rey?? why do we know nothing about the lead character in the film after an entire movie??????? and why is kylo ren named Ben if he is Leia and Han&apos;s son? in the extended universe there were 4 grandchildren of Vader, Ben Skywalker, Jaina solo,anakin solo and jacen solo who would turn to be Darth caedus. Or what about the lost armada? I feel like Disney destroyed the saga because it doesn&apos;t offer or expand anything new, and just reuses the same plot from the previous episodes!! anyways i don&apos;t feel like ranting anymore because there is nothing left to say other than this movie is a rehashed turd! IF YOU HATE THIS MOVIE LIKE MY COMMENT PLEASE!!! Also don&apos;t believe what rotten tomatoes and IMDb rate this film, its a terrible mindless movie.",

It&apos;s a light-weight colourful love-comedy, a kind of time-style-capsule without any aspects of sorrow, very entertaining under the above-mentioned condition. Most of the Players are long forgotten. Paul Hubschmid, Harald Juhnke (and perhaps Willy Fritsch) may still be known, in Germany, that is. Willy Fritsch was a famous German Filmstar during the years 1920 till 1960, roughly. He died in 1973, according to his imdb-biography, BUT....\n\n.... there&apos;s A SLIGHT MiISTAKE in his imdb-biography: Among the films for which he should be known there is included &apos;Inglorious Basterds&apos; by Quentin Tarantino (2009). If so, he must have been engaged out of his grave in the famous cemetery of Hamburg-Ohlsdorf, 36 years after he was buried there."

An uncle is constantly putting presure on his nephew (Henry B. Walthall) to spend more time on his work. When the nephew falls in love with a local girl (Blanche Sweet) the uncle demands that they call it off. When the nephew can&apos;t think of anything else, he decides the only way to keep the girl is by killing the uncle. This film is based on several Edgar Allan Poe stories with the second half of the film dealing mainly with The Tell-Tale Heart. You can tell this film was quickly made but there&apos;s still some nice direction, good performances and G.W. Bitzer&apos;s wonderful cinematography. There&apos;s some nice scenes dealing with devils and ghouls from Hell as well as a scene of Jesus. The special effects are quite nice for the era as well. Mae Marsh and Ralph Lewis have small parts. Due to the lack of copyright laws at the time, Griffith used all these short Poe stories without any credit being given."

      "reviewBody": "A rather unique conspiracy thriller / dark comedy, &quot;Winter Kills&quot; is based on a novel by Richard Condon of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; fame. It may not be nearly as well known, but it merits a look. Jeff Bridges stars as Nick Kegan, the younger half brother of an assassinated U.S. President. 19 years after the killing, Nick comes across a man who makes a dying confession that he was one of the gunmen. Nick then becomes determined to solve this old mystery, soldiering on even as his extremely rich and influential businessman father (John Huston) tries to manipulate the course of events. As Nick pursues leads, he realizes that the people he encounters cannot be taken at face value, and that not all of these leads are going to be particularly helpful.\n\nA sincere and likable performance by Bridges helps to anchor the tale, and there&apos;s a nonstop parade of famous faces in supporting roles and cameos: Anthony Perkins, Eli Wallach, Sterling Hayden, Dorothy Malone, Tomas Milian, Ralph Meeker, Toshiro Mifune, Richard Boone, and an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor. But despite all of these heavy hitters gracing the film with their presence, it&apos;s Huston that commands a great deal of attention. He does seem to be quite enjoying himself playing this overbearing and grandiose character. The beautiful Belinda Bauer is appealing as the love of Nicks&apos; life.\n\nWilliam Richert scripted, and directs the film as a commentary on the nature of politics, the real-life assassination of JFK, and the power wielded by the affluent 1% represented by Hustons&apos; Pa Kegan. It&apos;s a rather intricate mystery, and the best part of it is that you can&apos;t be sure where it&apos;s going, and aren&apos;t two steps ahead of Nick the whole time. One particularly silly scene has an unlikely character attempting to dispose of Nick, only for the sequence to include a rather hilarious, gratuitous dose of T &amp; A.\n\nAbsorbing entertainment, with real-life production stories that are stranger than anything in the film.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

All the performances are fantastic and at times raw opening with Glenn Close as a doctor looking after her invalid mother, Holly Hunter as a bank manager dealing with an unplanned pregnancy and an observant street woman, Kathy Baker as a single mother debating a romance with a new neighbour, Calista Flockhart is a tarot reader whose girlfriend is dying of cancer and police detective Amy Brenneman examines her loneliness when her blind sister Cameron Diaz begins dating.\n\nThere are some beautifully shot scenes here especially the outdoor ones although I was distracted by the random black cloudiness that appeared at the top of the screen from time to time. Like most people I thought there was something wrong with my copy of the movie. Not sure what that was supposed to signify.\n\nI also think this could have benefited from more of an arc tying all the stories together (like the suicide woman) as it was I failed to see any connection. 5/31/15",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t ask me why, but I have now seen about all of these. This one is probably the most like an American teen comedy in that characters are at least remotely believable as actual &quot;lise&quot; (high school) students. The teen plot, involving the sexy headline star Gloria Guida, is very dumb. Guida&apos;s schoolgirl character &quot;Angela&quot; is torn between two lovers--one, who tries to romance her in a straightforward manner, and the other who pretends to be severely injured in a car accident they have (while he is feeling her up). This hare-brained scheme does somehow get her naked and in bed with him, and it also provides some moments of frustrating coitus interruptus for the other guy when &quot;Angela&quot; starts thinking about the injured kid whenever he&apos;s about to score.\n\nUnlike with an American teen movie though, most of the comedy in these is provided not by horny teens, but by buffoonish adults, including all three of the ubiquitous Italian stooges--Lino Banfi, Alvaro Vitali, and Gianfranco D&apos;Angelo. Banfi plays &quot;Angela&apos;s&quot; father (although it would violate all the laws of genetics for a guy that looks like him to sire a girl that looks like her). He owns a sporting goods store and pretends to be his athletic younger brother (with hair) in order to romance a sexy customer (the voluptuous Ria DeSimone). He also becomes the school track coach in his new identity. Vitali, has apparently graduated from being a horny student, and is now a horny music teacher. (There is a funny scene where he nearly hyperventilates while watching a slutty female student fellate a recorder). The short squat Vitali also turns out to be a great sprinter and poses as a student to run on Banfi&apos;s track team. D&apos;Angelo is a windbag professor (and father of the malingerer)who at gets cuckolded three times in a row by his male students, who pretend to be him in order to take advantage of his kinky mistress (who likes him to pretend to be a cat burglar). Of course, this is patently ridiculous--a schoolteacher who looks like D&apos;Angelo, having a mistress? C&apos;mon! \n\nBut let&apos;s be honest about the real reason anyone then or now would watch this: Gloria Guida gets naked once and Ria DeSimone strips down to her bra and panties. Bridget Petronnio (later to be much abused in Italian sleaze films like &quot;House by the Edge of the Park&quot;) also has nude scenes and is good as a slutty brunette student. And there is a spying-on-the-girls-in-the-shower scene that anticipates &quot;Porky&apos;s&quot; by several years. But this is mostly just more of the same."

      "reviewBody": "The Phelps family seem like the perfect subject for Louis Theroux since his mode of operation generally is to go into odd or extreme groups (families, hobbies, jobs etc) and chat with the people in an innocent-abroad type way. With the first film he did on them it did actually work and it made for a good film where he was able to explore their believes and question them pretty well; it also helped that Keith Allen did a similar film that was so awful that it made Theroux&apos;s look even better by comparison. Suffice to say I didn&apos;t think the first film had left the job half-done or that there was a huge area of complexity within the very simple Phelps&apos; family that was untapped, so I wasn&apos;t sure what the point of a second film was.\n\nAfter it screened for the first time I read the title and the content and saw that it involved people leaving the group and also a civil law-suit being taken out so perhaps this was going to open the subject out a lot more and give Theroux more cracks to politely ease himself into. Having now seen the film for myself it seemed that, if this was the known aim of the producers then if nothing else it was certainly known to the church members as well because Theroux pretty much gets nothing other than a replay of the things he already got in the first film. What he covers is the same protests, the same unquestioning bigotry of the members and the same presentation of people being knowingly awful but justifying it by convincing themselves that they have a right to be this way – basically the same material of the first film but played again. The law-suit gets a mention and a few former members get a few minutes to talk so we know they are rejected but otherwise it is all the same as the first film.\n\nThe problem with this is not only that it seems unnecessary but also that, without the &quot;introductory&quot; feel of the first film, there is not exploration to be had and with nothing new to offer it just feels like Theroux was trying to get ratings off the back of the previous film – because the Phelps seem no different here than teenage boys trolling on the internet, happy to shock, happy to upset and convincing themselves that they have a right to do it. It doesn&apos;t help that everyone is wise to Theroux this time; &quot;the thing that confuses me...&quot; starts Louis at one point, only to be told &quot;you&apos;re not confused&quot;, which is totally true, he isn&apos;t and it is also evident from other comments that Theroux is seen as a weasel and they are keen to make sure and give him only the party-line without any cracks. Access is noticeably less than in the first film and discussions are not as good. The only good bit is also a repeat of last time, where Louis chats with the 18-year old Grace, which is a repeat of when he did get good material from a couple of the teenage girls. This time though, Grace is surrounded by three other members of the family to make sure Louis can&apos;t break her down – it is still good though because Grace is not only quite sweet in her manner but also seems to be a creative photographer and it is sad to see her living how she is.\n\nGenerally though, there is nothing here and if you&apos;ve seen the first film on this subject there really isn&apos;t a reason to watch this one; and if you haven&apos;t seen the first one then why watch this follow-up when the first is much better? I&apos;ve watched some great Louis Theroux films in the last month (Miami Megajail for example) and have some promising ones coming up (the Extreme Love pairing) but this was a unnecessary film that offers nothing and one of his weaker films as a result."

The film is essentially a travelogue of the Asia Pacific region with Bud visiting temples, casinos, and a sumo wrestling match while chasing clues that he believes will lead to a mole on the police force. \n\nWith a little more character development and less slapstick, this could have been a very nice thriller. As it is, it is a pleasant 70&apos;s action film that is light on plot.",

I&apos;m not praising this and saying this was better than Tootsie, but it was actually really funny. My 10/10 may well be a sympathy vote, but who cares, the movie was hilarious and irresistible.\n\nThe movie stars Barry Watson from 7th Heaven and Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville star as Dave and Adam, two high-standing people from the KOK Fraternity. Them and the frat idiot Doofer (Harland Williams) are framed for stealing money for an important cruise and are kicked out with no place to go. They then dress up as women under the names Daisy, Adina, and Roberta and pledge the DOG Sorority, where all the ugly and weird girls go. I almost hate admitting this, but the lead actors were actually kinda cute as the women they were playing. Watson particularly looks hot as Daisy. What unfolds next is your run-of- the-mill gender-bender where the guys get a chance to see life in a woman&apos;s perspective and they help the other girls change for the better. That has been done many times before with much better results. But does better always mean funnier? Not necessarily. It has its moments of sheer hilarity. Aside from that, the movie itself is just simply fun and enjoyable. This isn&apos;t a must own or highly recommended, just the perfect movie to watch if you want to kill time or crave something simple-yet-funny.\n\n3/4",

      "reviewBody": "Universal Studios could always be counted upon to devise some interesting stories in the sci- fi genre at a time when the genre simply exploded. Also among their undeniable classics during this period are gems like Creature from the Black Lagoon, Tarantula, and The Incredible Shrinking Man. This particular tale (although the final screenplay is credited to Harry Essex, the original treatment by Ray Bradbury was left largely intact) explores that theme of mankind seemingly always fearing and distrusting anything it doesn&apos;t understand, and reacting to it with aggression.\n\nLikable, earnest Richard Carlson stars as John Putnam, an amateur astronomer in the small town of Sand Rock, Arizona. One night he (and others) witness a &quot;meteor&quot; violently crashing to Earth (in one of the most startling introductions to a film of this kind). The aliens on board stealthily go about abducting local citizens and altering their appearance to look like these people. All they really want is to be able to work on their ship in peace, and leave before too long, but naturally there are humans who don&apos;t want to get with the program, like hot tempered sheriff Matt Warren (Charles Drake).\n\nLovely Barbara Rush is Carlsons&apos; appealing leading lady in this extremely well directed, succinct film with as much moody black &amp; white atmosphere as one could ask from this kind of entertainment. One will notice that all we get at the beginning is the title; the cast and crew credits are all saved for the final few minutes - an interesting (but not THAT uncommon) innovation for an older film. There&apos;s fine use of stock music from such composers as Henry Mancini, and the cinematography by Clifford Stine is excellent. The aliens are effectively hideous looking in their natural guise, but they begin to be revealed perhaps a bit too soon into the story. The alien P.o.V. shots are pretty cool.\n\nAs was said, Rush is very appealing, but it&apos;s unfortunate that her role keeps requiring her to scream at things: a Joshua tree, a kid in a costume, an undisguised alien (well, at least that one is understandable). The supporting cast is impressive, right down the line: Drake, Russell Johnson, Joe Sawyer, George Eldredge, Bradford Jackson, Dave Willock.\n\nAlthough originally filmed in 3-D, &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot; works just as fine without it.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "While the least-known and, really, the least impressive of the Bogart/Bacall features, this is still a solid, if rather offbeat, movie that combines a film-noir atmosphere with a gimmick that is meant to drive most of the story. The gimmick works moderately well, though it is really just a diverting sideline to the main drama and acting, which are what really make the movie work.\n\nThe premise is interesting enough, at least for a while, and it is interesting to see just how long they can go without showing the face of Bogart&apos;s character. They might have stretched it out just a bit too long, since there is more than enough in the rest of the plot to make any further use of the device unnecessary. Bacall and Bogart work together well from the beginning. In itself, the pairing works almost as well here as in their three better-known movies together - it&apos;s just that here there is a less for them to work with.\n\nThe two stars do get plenty of help from Agnes Moorehead, who plays her role with relish. Tom D&apos;Andrea and Bruce Bennett help out when they get the chance. Delmer Daves also creates a generally believable atmosphere to serve as the background to the story, and to help get it past the less plausible stretches. Overall, while hardly up to the high standard of the other Bogart/Bacall pairings, &quot;Dark Passage&quot; is a solid if unspectacular feature that is worth seeing if you like the stars and/or the genre."

      "reviewBody": "I guess this was the weekend on TCM for &apos;60s international films. In the &apos;60s, most of what was done was big - big historical dramas, big western dramas, big international comedies, and done on a smaller scale, the sex comedies like Sex and the Single Girl.\n\nWhat&apos;s New Pussycat was an international sex comedy with the usual huge, well known cast: Peter Sellers, Romy Schneider, Peter O&apos;Toole, Ursula Andress, Paula Prentiss, Capucine, with a cameo by Richard Burton. This was Woody Allen&apos;s first produced film script and his first film role. It wasn&apos;t a happy experience.\n\nPeter O&apos;Toole plays Michael James, the British editor of a Paris magazine He is in love with Carole (Schneider). She wants to get married, but he can&apos;t commit to her. Women are constantly after him, and he is constantly giving in.\n\nHe sees one Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Sellers) who wants Michael&apos;s life, particularly one of his patient, Renee (Capucine). Carole, meanwhile, is friendly with Michael&apos;s friend Victor (Allen) who is crazy about her and also wants Michael&apos;s life. The whole thing converges at the Château Chantel one weekend. \n\nThis film is purportedly based on the love life of Warren Beatty and the title taken from the way he answered the phone. He obviously did not wind up making the film. Peter Sellers adlibbed through a great deal of the movie and took all of Woody Allen&apos;s funny lines, diminishing Allen&apos;s part. The two of them loathed one another.\n\nWhat&apos;s New Pussycat started out hilariously, with funny dialogue and situations. As it went on, it became more and more of an annoying mess and went out of control, culminating in a Keystone Kops type scene that was very funny. However, what preceded it was disorganized insanity.\n\nThere definitely are funny scenes and good performances. Paula Prentiss is especially good, as is Allen. Sellers is great until he seems to veer off of the script. I&apos;m not sure if Peter O&apos;Toole did his own stunts, but some of what he did was fantastic - the role called for him to be very physical. He was quite funny. Romy Schneider as usual was the straight man to this chicanery.\n\nWatch in the bar scene where Peter O&apos;Toole and a man talk and O&apos;Toole says, give my best to what&apos;s-her-name - it&apos;s Richard Burton, and the what&apos;s-her-name is guess who. Very cute. \n\nI like slapstick, I like madcap, but I like it structured, so I&apos;m not the best judge of this. I prefer the MGM Marx Brothers to the Paramount ones, for instance. \n\nThis was hard to take after a while.",

      "description": "Lost down Memory Lane directed by Klara Van Es, is the first documentary, about living with AlzheimerÂ’s, as seen through the eyes of the people who suffer from it. The characters live together in an apartment called Iduna, under constant supervision and care. Iduna is a somewhat unusual department of The Bijster, a nursing home for people with dementia in Essen, near Antwerp, Belgium. The eight residents of Iduna are in - scientifically considered - the first phase of the disease: flurries of lucidity, forgetfulness and falling into oblivion alternate constantly.\r\n\r\nThese eight individuals are followed during one year by using different narrative levels: the daily routine, breaking it and their life stories. Only in that way the audience can discover who they are, who they were and what ultimately remains. Only then, their live stories will surface. Only then it becomes clear how their (self-)consciousness crumbles and the absent-mindedness slowly but inevitably gains ground upon their lucidity. At the end of the film the characters are not the same, not only because their illness has changed them, but also because of their advanced disease, they may have disappeared completely, physically or mentally.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, Lost down Memory Lane, is a &quot;tranche de vie&quot;, a portrait of the daily doings of people in a particular habitat and ditto state. Lost down Memory Lane is also a portrait of that same condition: a brutal disease that irreversible expropriates the memory from the characters.",

      "reviewBody": "Nice Italian Western with sad atmosphere , marvelous musical score and elements of Greek tragedy about two brothers : Cain/Abel alike . It deals with an ex-con (Anthony Steffen) out of prison and seeks justice and vengeance against his brother who wrongly incarcerated him . His sibling is called Sartana (Gianni Garco or Gary Hudson who took this pseudonym based on Gary Cooper and Rock Hudson) , a violent bandit dressed in soldier clothes and including the usual poster : ¨Wanted 10.000 dollars , dead or alive . Sartana is a leader of a nasty gang (Sieghart Rupp of ¨Fistful of Dollars¨) who carry out blackmails and massacre against various locations as Campos , Wishville, and Blackstone . The unsettling and disturbing Sartana supported by the corrupt Judge Waldorf (Carlo A&apos;Angelo) proceeds his activities at whatever cost , acting as judge , jury and executioner . The film ends in a sentence : ¨Non Odiare Il Tuo Fratello Nel Tuo Cuore , E Non Levanti Contra Al Tuo Sangue ; Levitico XIX¨ \n\nIt is a typical Spaghetti Western including common scenarios , two-fisted antiheroes , rapid zooms and strong confrontations full of shots , crossfire and violence . Nice production design shot in Elios studios and Almeria , of course , and adding a peculiar Aztec temple where the villain Sartana lives , in similar style to ¨Requiescant¨ (Carlo Lizzani) temple . Italia/Yugoslavia actor Gianni Garco or Giovanni Garkovich and the Brazilian Anthony Steffen give their ordinaries performances . Support cast is pretty well , it is filled with familiar faces from Spaghetti such as Sieghardt Rupp , Franco Fantasia , Carlo D&apos;Angelo and Carla Calò as tragic mother . Besides , brief appearances from Sal Borghese and Riccardo Pizzuti . Evocative and thrilling musical score by Michele Lanzeranza in Ennio Morricone wake . \n\nBeing decently filmed by Colmenar Viejo and La Pedriza , Madrid , Spain and El Lacio , studios Elios Rome , Italy . This Spaghetti Western was decently shot by the Italian professional Albert Cardone . Albert was a prestigious assistant director to popular films as ¨Ben Hur¨, ¨Purple noon¨, ¨Cagliostro¨ , ¨Carmen¨ , ¨Don Camilo¨ , ¨Return of Don Camilo¨. And shot some films , most of them entertaining Westerns such as : ¨¨ Blood at Sundown¨ , ¨Kidnapping¨ , ¨Il Lungo Giorno Del Massacro¨ , ¨20.000 Dollari Sul¨ , ¨L&apos;ira Di Dio¨ and starred by usual genre stars as Brett Halsey , Gianni Garco , Peter Martell , Wayde Preston , Fernando Sancho and Anthony Steffen . Rating : Better than average 6.5/10 . Only for Spaghetti Western aficionados . \n\nThis ¨Mille Dolollari Sul Nero¨ was first movie in which showed up ¨Sartana¨ , but this Sartana has nothing to do with true Sartana who appeared in ¨Se Incontri Sartana Prega Per Tu a Morte¨(1968) by Gianfranco Parolini or Frank Kramer , along with screenwriter Renato Izzo . Here Garco performed an unforgettable role as the ¨Mantello Nero¨ hero , as Sartana is a cunning card player ,elegantly dressed in black , he looks like a magician -Mandrake- more than a gunslinger . Parolini gives this character a ghostly style , introducing cynicism and amorality . To be followed by other Sartana (his origin name seems to be Satan) starred by Garco such as ¨10.0000 Dollari Per Un Massacro¨ (1967) by Romolo Guerrieri and ¨Per 1000.000 Dollari T&apos;amazzo¨(1967) by Giovanni Fago . Then , Anthony Ascott or Giuliano Carmineo filmed 4 Sartana entries , such as : ¨Soni Sartana Il Vistro Becchino (69) , ¨Buon Funerale Amigos , Paga Sartana¨ (70) , ¨Sartana arrives¨(70) and ¨Sartana Vendi La Pistola E Comprati La Bara¨ (71), most of them starred George Hilton . Giuliano Carmineo shot with Gianni Garco two similar roles to Sartana as ¨Gli Fumavano Le Colt , Lo Chiamavano Camposanto¨(71) and ¨Lo Chiamavano Spiritu Santo¨ (72) . Subsequently , Sartana was played by William Berger in ¨Sartana in valley of the gold¨ (70) and Peter Lee Lawrence performed ¨A dollar for Sartana¨(71) by Leon Klimovski .",

      "reviewBody": "Reviews thus far have not mentioned Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst, or how Cosmopolis can be interpreted as a dream using Jungian symbology. Cronenberg&apos;s previous movie was about Freud and Jung, so it is no artificial stretch to assume that he would apply Jung to a story, or that De Lillo had also done the same.\n\nIn Jungian dream analysis, the limousine can be taken as a metaphor of one&apos;s self, one&apos;s course in life. Each visitor to the limousine ought to be considered an aspect of the occupant&apos;s personality, each separate and distinct. There is the intellectual who has been hired to &quot;do theory,&quot;the young one who has been hired to find patterns, the nervous security expert who has tested for system vulnerabilities, the visiting prostitute (profane) who is asked to help obtain &quot;the chapel&quot; (sacred). Each character represents an aspect of a single self. Throughout the journey to get a &quot;haircut,&quot; (which is a Wall Street term for taking a loss), the outside security chief relays messages from &quot;The Complex,&quot; which might be interpreted as the unified self.\n\nI think this is clearly what Cronenberg intended. The fuller meaning of the movie resides in how the dream reflects the actual world, how it fits with the shared reality in which we all participate. How does this simple journey to get across the city reflect the pleasures and perils of existence? Can we really know the world, or can we only know ourselves? How is the main character a representation of the whole world, which has a kind of self, too? Does the ending of the movie reflect an outcome that is metaphorically plausible as an integration of macroeconomic, political, human forces shaping history? \n\nCosmopolis is an intellectual work, carefully crafted, and not at all pretentious, as some have said."

Her brother Carmelo gets killed and Rita brings in her evidence to the prosecutor who actually got her father&apos;s respect. She testifies against the Sicilian mob as revenge for her family&apos;s murders.\n\nThe story is somewhat muddled. Veronica D&apos;Agostino is good as the fierce heroine. She isn&apos;t a pretty little thing but she has a nice vulnerability. Gérard Jugnot is also good. The material is there but the intensity is dispersed. The tension comes and goes.

      "reviewBody": "In New York, the ambitious police officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino) is assigned by his Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) to work uncover in the gay S&amp;M underworld to seek out the serial-killer that is killing and severing the members of gays since he has the same appearance of the victims. Steve has the objective to be promoted to detective and get his golden shield and Capt. Edelson is the only one in the department who knows Steve&apos;s assignment. \n\nSteve does not tell to his girlfriend Nancy (Karen Allen) his mission and he needs to learn the behavior of this community. During the investigation, Steve is affected by the discoveries in this new world, but Captain Edelson does not want him to quit his assignment. \n\nIn the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, Al Pacino was among my favorite American actors with his magnificent performances. &quot;Cruising&quot; is an original movie that discloses part of the society unknown to straight persons like me: the gay S&amp;M world of New York in the late 70&apos;s. \n\nI have seen this film at least four time and today for the first time on DVD, and my greatest question is how far a person would go to be promoted. Steve Burns dreams on having a golden shield and when he has his chance, he accepts a dangerous psychological mission to find the serial-killer that is killing gays and affects his personal life and his relationship with his girlfriend. The conclusion is one of the most ambiguous that I have ever seen in an American movie, when Steve looks at his image on the mirror. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Parceiros da Noite&quot; (&quot;Night Partners&quot;)",

Both inside and out that becomes blatantly apparent and really is seven shades of stupid.\n\nSo we have shaky cam, we have night vision cam and we have the obligatory handicam filmed by someone who absolutely positively has to record everything for some reason.\n\nIn true Amityville style people change, folks turn on each other and yet somehow this is the worst one yet.\n\nThe Good: \n\nIt ended, that bit was good \n\nThe Bad: \n\nThat had to be the least sexy sex scene since the zombie humping in Braindead (1992) \n\nNOT the Amityville house \n\nThe &quot;Warning&quot; real footage thing is getting dumb\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie: \n\nThe fact that there are no opening credits, no closing credits and therefore everyone involved is uncredited screams volumes \n\nSomeone should really trademark Amityville so Joe Talentless can&apos;t keep adding it to his film",

The material decides to keep it all glum, and moves from the investigation period into the back-story of the victim. The seldom, and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in, but when it flashback to the victim&apos;s side showing her final days weren&apos;t as compelling, and became somewhat stodgy and stock-like. While the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring and it&apos;s not helped out by its sloppy execution. Howard Blake&apos;s music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger, and director Claude Chabrol&apos;s capable handling (well for most part) has a strong stylistic and tight manner, which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry do an incredibly good job as well.",

      "reviewBody": "Garners more respect than a spot on favorites list, &quot;Gomorra&quot; chronicles five seemingly disconnected stories with one thing in common: all are heavily influenced by a criminal organization run by the Camorras, an ominous mafia organization with a tight grip on Naples, Italy. Stylishly delivered, with extra kudos on editing and cinematography, Film will no doubt attract fans of the violent underworld, but might be disappointed by its verite approach, even if it perfectly captures reality, as such. Absolute antithesis to depiction from the American mafia, film is gritty and has zero entertainment value but in retrospect, picture was produced with such depressing intentions.\n\nMulti plot film features more on characters attracted by the allure of the Camorras than the Camorras themselves. The five stories were plucked out from a novel by Roberto Saviano: the non-fiction that thrived on the best seller&apos;s list in Italy. Stories range from a coming of age teenager wanting to be identified with the mafia to a fresh university graduate looking for a promising vocation. Through varying levels of perspectives: from the violent eyed to the diplomatic, &quot;Gomorra&quot; stuns as it lists the organization&apos;s almost totalitarian control over the underbelly of Italy. It creates the impression of a country rotting from the inside out. With each story written by a different writer, what could have been an interconnection disaster is controlled well by director Matteo Garrone.\n\nAmbitiously edited, fine balance between chaos and narrative is clearly defined by Marco Spoletini. First 40 minutes won&apos;t bode well for viewers looking for an easy diversion, as it is edited to confusion creating the illusion that the film started midway. Nonetheless, the stories do emerge, to great relief and from there on out, film would have established its style to a keen audience.\n\nCinematography, too is top notch. Marco Onorato paints Italy with a dull set of colors, resembling more of a third world purgatory rather than a honeymooner&apos;s travel brochure. Even Venice&apos;s bright reds and blues are muted with grey and brown with a hint of overexposure. Overall effect adds stupendously to the film as it gives it a sense of space and absolutely squashes any sense of hope an over-reader might derive.\n\nAccuracy is greatly appreciated here. Film tries to blurry lines between dramatic film and documentary with impressive results. Details are all intact: dialogue is accurately more dialect derived, shooting locations seem extracted from a news clip and most thesping is done on dead-on accuracy by first timers.\n\nWith production values on stratospheric levels, film&apos;s overall intention is transparent: absolutely naught empathy is allowed, allowing audiences to soak in the moody atmosphere and simply co-exist with the protagonists clearly tested by circumstance. This will be its main predicament in garnering a more universal success as it asks a lot from an audience whose expectations might lean towards the slick of &quot;Cidade de Deus&quot;.\n\nWith everything into consideration, film is too well choreographed that it becomes as intimidating as the organization that it exposes. Multiple plays won&apos;t be troublesome as every single detail here has a sense of subtext of tragedy unwilling to be diluted by repetition. However, might only be uncovered by fans willing to revisit.\n\nPicture won the Grand Prize of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; is a 1995 film with chaotic production and distribution and with unfair reviews of the professional critics. Renny Harlin and Geena Davis were married at that time and he convinced the producers to cast his wife in an action film in a complete misevaluation of her talent. Geena Davis was a great actress in comedy and drama genres in the 80´s and 90´s but was only reasonable in the role of the female pirate Morgan Adams. Another problem was to find an actor for Morgan´s slave William Shaw since Matthew Modine was the last choice in a long list of actors that refused the role. It seems that this notorious film was also the responsible for the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures since the box office was frustrating.\n\nSaid that, &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; is indeed an entertaining modern (in 1995) pirate movie, with a good story. The successful franchize &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is an improvement of &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Ilha da Garganta Cortada&quot; (&quot;The Cutthroat Island&quot;)",

Nik convinces her to take a secondary road under the protest of Bobby and the car stops with melted engine. They find a house in the middle of nowhere and decide to take the car parked in the garage to the next city, and return with a rented car to pay for the damages provoked by Nik; Melissa leaves her cell number. However, they discover that the owner of the place is the sadistic truck driver Rusty Nail (Mark Gibbon) and they have to pay a high price for what they did.\n\n&quot;Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead&quot; has a stupid story using with elements of &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and &quot;Duel&quot; with the pretext of sadism. Unfortunately the argument is too silly and never works. When Bobby is abducted, for example, the attitude of Melissa is ridiculous since they knew where the deranged driver lived. Rusty Nail is unreasonably omnipresent and indestructible and the conclusion with the intention of a sequel is also awful. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Perseguição 2  O Resgate&quot; (&quot;Pursue 2  The Rescue&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I gotta stop buying DVDs sight unseen.  It happened with Affliction and now with Panic.  I bought into the rave reviews and felt disappointed after watching it.  This could have been a truly great film...if ONLY they had focused on the father/son relationship and left that godawful May/September romance on the cutting room floor.  If only Neve Campbell&apos;s character had some smarts, maybe even a little class to separate her from the rest of the LA airheads it MIGHT have worked.  She was nothing but a tease and it distracted from the movie greatly.  She and Macy had NO chemistry together and their scenes were a total waste of time.  Every time they were on screen together, you keep asking the same thing:  When are we going to see Sutherland again?  I&apos;m a child of the 60&apos;s when movies were VERY good.  So, when I hear some young person praise a recent movie as great, I must remember that &quot;great&quot; movies made today would have been only &quot;good&quot; in the sixties.  I refer back to what I call the John Carpenter Syndrome.  It works like this.  John Carpenter made some good thrillers/horrors back in the seventies.  But compared to the crap being produced today, they seem like GREAT films.  People must remember that they&apos;re good films existing in a garbage heap of crap will seem better than they are."

This has some of the coolest gun fights that I have seen in a long time. The shootout in the mall is just amazing. Listen for the echo of the of the single shot sidearm. Very very cool. The plot is about five people who are in the Triad that must protect a boss at all costs. They come from different walks of life. One is a gun enthusiast, another is wanting to make a name for himself as a gunmen, another owns a club and is being constantly harassed by some guys who think they are tough. Anthony Wong points out their mistake the hard way. Oh yes. And Anthony Wong is a hair stylist...don&apos;t let that fool you one bit. If anyone has seen &quot;Untold Story&quot; and John Woo&apos;s &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, then you know what I am talking about. Just see this movie with another great film by director Johnnie To called &quot;Fulltime Killer&quot;. This movie gets a 10 out 10.",

The two of them were marvelous - and the end of the film had an outtake of Hoffmann and DeNiro practicing &quot;The Name Game&quot; that alone was worth the entire movie.  There were certainly stereotypes among the minor characters but the plot was good and so was the acting.  My acting teacher used to describe plays/films like &quot;Virginia Wolff&quot; as love stories. Using his criteria of two people coming together, sharing experiences and touching each other&apos;s hearts - Flawless certainly qualifies as an atypical love story.",

Sundar is uneducated and is duped several times, even by his friends, through his innocence. Sundar meets Payal, portrayed by Rani, and through misunderstanding Sundar is mistaken for being mute. Sundar is uncertain if Payal loves him or pities him, but does not want to lose this love by revealing he can speak. Sundar eventually feels his lies make him unworthy of Payal&apos;s love, so he decides to take a drastic step.\n\nPyaar Diwana Hota Hai is a complete Bollywood film. It provides comedy, romance, musicals, drama, melodrama and to a degree, bittersweet horror. Govinda plays the full gamut of emotions brilliantly and it is hard not to empathize with his character&apos;s increasing anguish. An exemplary moment is while Sundar is waiting in a room before he has an operation. You can feel his pain as he shouts words of love he has never spoken before to Payal! The ending is abrupt and made me cringe as the reality of his actions hit me, but upon reflection, it suited Sundar&apos;s disposition, his guilt for betraying Payal, and his passion to redeem himself to the woman he loves. Well-written, well-played and bittersweet indeed.",

No other movie until know was able to make me feel such pain  almost physical just from watching the story that unfolds on the screen. With risk to repeat myself I must note that this was probably the hardest movie to watch from all I have seen until the moment.\n\nI made few notes when it started  there were about the interesting characters, the song of Libera I noticed  but now I can not really write about that. Shocking, painful, cruel, realistic to the core  I can go on like this for a long time. The fact that &quot;Song for a raggy boy&quot; is based on a true story contributes to the powerful effect this movie has on its viewers.\n\nThe acting is quite good as well  so good that I felt like I knew some of the characters in person. The young actors were really convincing and I felt Delaney and Mercier almost like my friends. But let me tell you a bit more about the movie  it is set in a reformatory school run by the catholic church  as it often happens the boys who are send there find anything , but help and support  instead they are beaten and abused mentally and physically ( some even sexually ) from the priests. One of them Brother John is in charge of discipline  here is the line with which he tells the new teacher for the kind of job he is expected to do: &quot;The creatures you are going to teach are not to be confused with intelligent human beings.&quot; Only this line itself was enough for me to imagine the horrible manner in which the boys are treated. The new teacher however tried to change all that  and as the story unfolds I began to really like him  he was strict, but at the same time caring with the boys he taught. Brother John becomes his enemy almost from the very beginning and after failing to persuade the superior at the institution to dismiss the new teacher he directs his anger to the school pupils. You will have to watch the movie to find out how it all ends  This movie gets 10 out of 10 for me  since it is sure one of the best ones I have ever watched.\n\nSimilar movies: Sleepers, Dead Poets Society",

      "reviewBody": "This is a short, beautiful animated CGI film based on a picture book with the same name.\n\nI personally think this is a sweet, fun, amusing film. Unfortunately its animation quality is not all that good, but the good qualities of the film are replaced with a fantastic narrator (Hugh Laurie), a sweet storyline and lovely characters (even the baddies are entertaining!).\n\nAn enchanted forest is created when some trees decide to &quot;move up&quot; to a big hill, where they can enjoy the sunshine and a new life. Many creatures move into the new forest and it soon becomes a paradise. Down below, live horrible goblins in a dark, gloomy forest. One night, a young boy comes through the dark, murky forest, running after the pursuing goblins. In the snowy cold of winter, the boy makes his way into the enchanted forest. When he wakes up, he meets the inhabitants and he is called Jack Frost, due to his strange power to make things cold with one touch of his finger...\n\nI recommend this to all children, as they will all probably enjoy it, to grown-ups who enjoy stuff that usually only little children watch and to people who like Hugh Laurie. Enjoy &quot;The Tale of Jack Frost&quot;!",

There were many times when the camera focused on an object instead of the people who were speaking.  There was also many other interesting camera techniques.  These various camera angles added to the over feeling of the film.  This film also had a very interesting plot, showing how powerful the powerful are.  No one can get too close to them, or know too much.  The movie was darkly funny.  There were many funny moments and even more irony.  The most ironic part was the movie ending right where it began.  It came full circle, and showed how small and invisible the poor were compared to the rich.  The movie kept a constant contrast between the rich and the poor.  The movie was full of black male, threats and using people. Everyone was pinned against everyone esle.  This made the movie very interesting to me, but at the same time there was an entire subplot that was never made clear.\n\nThere was secrets about the factory and a conflict between the French man and the English that was never made clear.  This made the movie a bit hard to enjoy, because we never get to know what is actually happening.  And then there is Rosemarie in the middle of it all, and by leaving out all the details it allows the movie to focus on her story, after all thats what this movie is about. Overall, the camera angles and irony made this movie enjoyable to me."

All rolled into a Christmas movie about Santa.\n\nA typical and predictable holiday movie with a few insights, but I really didn&apos;t care much for the lead male character. He was a bit over the top, but I suppose that was the intent, since I believe he was the writer and/or producer.\n\nI won&apos;t watch again, but the few inspirational scenes regarding faith in Santa was obviously to be applied to life in general.\n\nA good movie for kids as it seemed to be aimed towards the Mr. Rogers crowd.",

      "reviewBody": "Woodrow Wilson was not considered a very successful President before he was &quot;rehabilitated&quot; by FDR during World War II as part of a campaign to show the mistakes the US had made a generation before. This film&apos;s glorification of Wilson was clearly part of that war propaganda effort.\n\nAlexander Knox is perfectly cast in this effort, he physically looks just right, and has all the mannerisms. Of course the character is shifted from the reality (a stunningly racist, intellectually isolated scholar) to a &quot;pre-FDR&quot; who talks of &quot;all races working together&quot; and whose every motive is pure and well thought out. The Wilson of this film is pure hero, and always right, if shown as a touch stubborn.\n\nBut I was engaged despite it all. And the 1912 Convention scenes early in the film are brilliantly done. Check out Vincent Price as a campaign lieutenant. And Cedric Hardwicke is great as the villainous Republican Henry Cabot Lodge.",

The story is set in that familiar age of grace before World War One, but all the period costumes and picturesque European settings can&apos;t hide what looks like a bargain basement Merchant-Ivory production. Bright spots are provided by a boisterous Max Von Sydow (an actor who can work miracles with even the most lackluster script), and Miranda Richardson in a curious dual role. The only liability in the cast is Carradine himself, whose flat American accent is totally out of place in the Old World setting (recalling his similar miscasting in Ridley Scott&apos;s &apos;The Duelist&apos;). The role demands more depth and charisma (or at least more enthusiasm) than he can muster, and under the perfunctory direction of a certain Roberto Faenza the film is never more than polite, mannered, and (for lack of a better word) inert.",

      "reviewBody": "Sorry to say but this is what our so-called democratic state has come too. Do not believe anything you see or read. Research for yourself if you ever want to know the truth about anything. The media in this country will never give you the full stories. Go look at independent news organizations around the web and world for you news about America. Just like other countries do when they want to know about their country. Wake up America, we have become a fascist state. Not the country that we once were. Look up quotes of your for fathers to see that what they feared is exactly what is happening. Many presidents have for warned of what is happening. From Washington, Jefferson, to newer presidents like Eisenhower. Once again, please if you do anything, at least take notes on this film, then research those names and documents you see. That way you can form your own opinion and not those given too you. That is what America is truly about, forming your own opinion, not what the government wants you too think. I will leave you with some quotes from great leaders of our time: \n\n&quot;The jaws of power are always open to devour, and her arm is always stretched out, if possible, to destroy the freedom of thinking, speaking, and writing.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.&quot; \n\n&quot;Power always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension of the weak; and that it is doing God&apos;s service, when it is violating all His laws.&quot; \n\nJohn Adams \n\n&quot;The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist.&quot; \n\nWinston Churchill, November 21, 1943 \n\n&quot;I look upon an increase of the power of the State with the greatest fear, because although while apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality, which lies at the root of all progress. We know of so many cases where men have adopted trusteeship, but none where the State has really lived for the poor.&quot; \n\nMahatma Gandi\n\nAmerica please wake up, and rise up to take your country back from those who wish to steal your rights. I should say stand up to get your rights back since the &quot;MILITARY ACT&quot; has stolen your rights to Habeas Corpus, and the Bill of Rights. I ask you, what type of Constitution do you have in the land of the free if you do not have Habeas Corpus and the Bill of Rights? My only logical answer is that we do not live in the land of the free anymore, maybe we never did. America is an &quot;idea&quot; not a country if you ask me. It is no different than &quot;Camelot&quot; of its time. An unbelievable &quot;idea&quot;, but just that, only an &quot;idea&quot; not reality.\n\nSad times we live in, and you must ask yourself; do we deserve to be here if we allow the so-called beacon of freedom to flicker out?",

      "reviewBody": "Director Hans Müller once was assistant-director to Werner Hochbaum and this experience may well have helped to turn the not so surprising script into a minor, but nice, lively, well-paced and entertaining melodrama; Müller knows how to give the melodrama a certain cinametic style with his direction of the light touch. But he also shows that with &quot;action&quot; he is not at his best: the execution of the sequence with crash of the truck is only so-so.\n\nMüller is also a good director of the cast. One may not agree with the rather narrow-minded typically 50&apos;s mores of some of the characters, due to the way how Müller gives precise attention to every character the cast makes the melodrama real, convincing and  - very important - unsentimental. Even someone like Rudolf Prack, normally a boring actor, is acceptable as the male lead and he certainly is a very good type-cast. A couple of nice variety acts and songs add to the fun.\n\nAficionados of old trains and steam locomotives will have a special interest in this film.",

Such is the excellence of this saga that a lot of people get sadness in their hearts if not tears in their eyes at the end. \n\nThis was the first Hindi version of Devdas. If we consider that the movie was made in 1936 and judge it accordingly then I must say it is an outstanding effort and a masterpiece of art. All main actors and supporting cast perform their role in a magnificent manner. The direction and screenplay is very powerful. Cinematography of Bimal Roy deserves applause.\n\nAll in all, a must watch for Hindi movie lovers. It is available for free on internet.",

This movie portrays the unfinished love life of the genius composer. Listening to many titles of his music, I realized Schubert was a true music genius. Both the screenplay and the performance are awkward like other movies 80 years ago. Sound is terrible. The story is a complete fiction. Nevertheless, after seeing it, I felt sense of fulfillment that I saw a good movie.\n\nBy the way, I am surprised that no one posted a review to this movie. It seems there is no English version, though this one is well rated in Japan. Maybe it is a reflection of that Schubert is more popular in Japan than the US?",

      "reviewBody": "I had very low expectations for No Strings Attached. The couple would make the decision to use each, one would fall for the other, and in the end they would live happily ever after. I was correct about the overall story line, but, impressively, the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that, there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!\n\nNatalie Portman shows her range of acting abilities by having two extremely different films in theaters at the same time. I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to drop the comedic one liners and portray a unaffectionate woman who&apos;s fallen in love realistically. Comparing this to her award-winning role in Black Swan made her abilities even more impressive. I cannot say the same for Ashton Kutcher. He has a great face and is great at comedic acting. However, each serious, romantic scene he was in became unrealistic and uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, this is the perfect date night or girls night movie. It has some great comedic moments and brings in the romance that most ladies love to see. If you are looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy, this is a great choice.\n\nSee more reviews at http://burningreview.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the movie twice: once in the cinema and once on DVD. I must say, it&apos;s looks better on DVD, because the director uses close ups a lot. In the cinema the movie also seems to drag a bit. At first I thought the movie was shot on 16 millimeter, but in scene one I saw the artifacts common with DV, so I knew what to expect. Contrary to another comment, which said the cinematography sucks, but can&apos;t tell why, just that it stinks. I think it was very brave to go the classic way and give room to the story, instead of using that old style of &apos;innovative cinematography&apos; ofter associated with DV. The person who wrote the comment, fotorobbert I recall, has an approach that is quite wrong: the question is, does the choice the filmmakers made fit the way the story is told, it&apos;s not about how yóu think it should be done. His added remark that another Dutch movie called Costa looked better is utterly stupid considering that movie was shot on 35 mm and had at least 100 times more budget. The question is more: why have the producers chosen to shoot on DV when they knew they were going to release the film in the cinema? Well, maybe they didn&apos;t at the time. Still, on DVD it really found it&apos;s place.\n\nSwingers&apos; problem is more the way the story is told. What is the main question? What is the main conflict? What genre is it? It&apos;s start out one way and ends another. Sometimes that works, this time it just feels strange. The cast is stellar at times, but is uncomfortable at others. There seems little room for improvisation or even to let a flow go. This gives the movie a cramped feeling sometimes. And I must say: the story itself doesn&apos;t help either. I personally think it&apos;s too simple given the characters the actors put out. It at times feels like a paint by numbers exercise. Next time, the writer director should get out there and try to be on his edge of creativity. He has the ability, but he&apos;s seems very restricted. Let&apos;s see where this man will take us next."

      "reviewBody": "Red Rock West is a modern film noir with twists upon twists and characters with the behaviour of rats tied in a sack.\n\nIts a gritty thriller with Nicholas Cage ends up in a bar and lies which leads him to all sorts of trouble. The bartender played by JT Walsh mistakes him for a hit-man and wants him to take out his wife.\n\nLara Flynn Boyle is his hot wife and it looks she has a thing with a ranch hand and Cage warns her about her husband. As Cage leaves town in the pouring rain he hits a pedestrian and takes him to hospital. The police close in on him about the accident and the elected sheriff is suspicious and he turns out to be JT Walsh.\n\nBefore long Dennis Hopper turns up as another suspicious character and then its a case of who to trust and who is lying while Cage tries to get away from Red Rock but keeps getting pulled back.\n\nIn the wrong hands this film would be preposterous and absurd. Director John Dahl has a sure touch for the drama, he gets the right types of performances from his main stars, good use of music and action scenes and piles on the twists and double crosses.\n\nThe 1990s were a good decade for Dahl and his Thriller Noirs which were essentially made on a low budget. One thing to notice in this film is that the police outside the Sheriff are rather smart and on the ball.",

      "reviewBody": "Like other early films by Jean Painlevé, this one is of imprecise date, and was released first in 1928 or 1929. It was originally silent, but has had a lecture, originally on title cards, narrated, and the print has a color title sequence. In addition it has either been expertly tinted or may have been filmed in some two-strip color process initially. Painlevé worked hard to make sure his films were not only scientifically accurate, but accessible to audiences.\n\nSome of the comments I have encountered surrounding Painlevé&apos;s work is that they are only for scientists. I am bemused by the attitude. Confronted with the weird and wondrous universe of life, is the only emotion to be roused a vague esthetic reaction? Is there no sense of curiosity? The film-maker&apos;s mind set may be drier and more scholastic than some, but it comes from the same source of wonder.",

      "reviewBody": "I love Roman Polanski&apos;s &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers,&quot; which is surprising to me now because for most of my life I thought it was dreadful.  I missed the original release back in 1967, but I was only eight years old then, and the version released in the U.S. was a truncated travesty of what Polanski intended.  I&apos;ve read that the movie was considered an almost complete fiasco because the executive producer, Martin Ransohoff, best known for &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies,&quot; wanted a very different film and cut 16 minutes out of Polanski&apos;s 107 minute cut, inserted a short cartoon before the titles (so people would know it was supposed to be a comedy; Ransohoff thought Polanski botched it that badly), and even re-dubbed some of the actors.  He also added the awful tag line to the title, &quot;Or, Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are in My Neck.&quot;  This must have been the version I saw on TV in the early seventies and thought so terrible.  Thankfully this abomination doesn&apos;t seem to be in circulation anymore.  However, despite its flaws &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; gained a cult following over the years, to a degree due to the morbid fascination with the murder of Sharon Tate, but also because the movie is really very good.  Paramount&apos;s Robert Evans recognized this back in &apos;67 and thought Polanski the right director for &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby.&quot;  He was right and the success of that film showed Hollywood what a master of the language of film Polanski is.\n\nIn 1983 MGM/UA Home Video released Polanski&apos;s original cut on cassette and on laserdisc (remember those?).  On laserdisc it was letterboxed so you could enjoy the full Panavision frame, and included the alternate main title sequences from the bastardized version as an extra.  For some reason, though I wasn&apos;t a fan of the film, I thought this was a disc I had to get, but after I first viewed it I wondered if I hadn&apos;t wasted my money.  I still couldn&apos;t see what was so great about it.  However, I didn&apos;t get rid of the disc and over the past nine years I&apos;ve viewed the movie several times.  I can&apos;t remember when I started to appreciate it, but now &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; is one of my favorite movies.\n\nRight from the main title sequence this film is really quite wonderful. Christopher Komeda&apos;s score is weird and haunting.  The day-for-night shots of the snowy countryside are a bit distracting, but kind of fit the fairy tale quality of the film&apos;s isolated, late 19th century Transylvanian winter never land.  The movie is extremely well-mounted with wonderful sets, especially the vampires&apos; castle.  All the performances are excellent.  Jack MacGowran&apos;s Professor Abronsius is an absolutely incredible characterization, unlike anything else MacGowran ever did on film.  The same is true of Alfie Bass&apos; Yoine Shagal, possibly the world&apos;s first Jewish vampire, and a terrible lecher.  Sharon Tate was probably never lovelier than in this movie, and Roman Polanski is very good as Alfred, in fact amazing when you consider he was also directing.  It is a tour de force on his part.  Finally, Ferdy Mayne&apos;s Count Von Krolock is a king vampire equal to any screen Dracula, while Iain Quarrier is also appropriately creepy as his gay vampire son, Herbert.\n\nLike the drinking of blood (I would imagine!), appreciation of &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; is very much an acquired taste.  I don&apos;t know what to say to those that don&apos;t like it except, Why don&apos;t you try watching it again? It might grow on you as it did me.  This movie also has one of the best one-sheet posters from the sixties, with art by Frank Frazetta.  I hope this movie comes to DVD soon, especially with commentary by Polanski, but I&apos;ve read that MGM considers the elements in need of restoration, so it may be a while.  However, it should look great when it does get to DVD.  I can&apos;t wait.",

Mugdha Godse is overbearing, but tolerable. \n\nRamleela is entertaining and the characters funny.

Not so in the film version by responsible Benjamin Christensen, where the baby is born and has to be taken care of, thereby introducing a theme to be used many times in the films from the Forties, the unwanted pregnancy and the following illegal abortion. Here all aspects of realism is played out in this detailed and comprehensive survey of the family trouble provoked by the unwanted arrival of a new baby. Mogens Wieth aged 21 has his film debut as the moody yet spoiled young man, and we see for the first time a team-up by Gunnar Lauring and Beatrice Bonnesen as a modern, elegant intellectual couple. Benjamin Christensen had his heyday during the silent film era, and this film is the best of his few sound movies.",

Inevitably the answer is disappointing since no one really wants to see them fall out and spend another movie&apos;s duration trying to figure out if they belong together or not. But that&apos;s what this movie does, and throws in all matter of contrivances to occupy the characters&apos; attention while they are separated. Of COURSE they&apos;re going to bump up against the age difference, but the way in which it&apos;s handled is a disservice to both their characters. They become idiots instead of being merely difficult, which they were in the first film. The two leads are appealing to watch, but they&apos;re not given enough interesting material to work with.",

      "reviewBody": "... as is the case with many films in the Criterion collection, because this film does not set things up nicely for you. It is a slow reveal for all of the characters with the basic theme of &quot;hope springs eternal&quot; or maybe &quot;Life is what you make of it&quot;. So after I had gotten a feel for the characters I went back and rewatched it to see what I didn&apos;t pick up the first time.\n\nThe focus of the film is a working class London family. Wendy works in a shop as a salesperson. Her husband is a chef in a restaurant. They got married at 17 - with her having to drop out of college - due to her pregnancy that produced twin girls. You&apos;d think then that this would be about their disappointment with how their lives turned out, but they are almost annoyingly positive. Wendy is the strong one, always smiling. Husband Andy is also always smiling and seems easily led by his friends. He just never gets around to fixing things around the house, and one friend (Stephen Rea), an obvious con artist, works his magic on Andy and gets him to spend money he does not have on a broken down fast food van. Andy has dreams of fixing it up and going into business for himself as he hates his job. And oddly enough Wendy doesn&apos;t explode at this expense and is very supportive. She seems to laugh her way through life.\n\nOne thing that she can&apos;t laugh through though is her daughter Nicola. She is about twenty, anorexic, a chain smoker, and completely hostile to everybody. She just sits in her room all day blurting out insults to everybody. You wonder if she is starving herself in hopes she will eventually just disappear. The other daughter seems well adjusted enough and is working as a plumber. She seems sexually ambiguous, and though nothing in the plot goes in that direction, I had to wonder if that is just me stereotyping or if it is the fact the film is 30 years old and films stereotyped too back in those days.\n\nThe family&apos;s other friend is Aubrey whose &quot;big dream&quot; is a Parisian themed restaurant. But his taste in decor is bizarre and tacky, he selects employees based on tenuous personal connections, and he has placed his restaurant between two businesses that would not bring foot traffic - one is a medical equipment supplier, and he has forgotten to advertise the restaurant. The result is disastrous.\n\nThe best scene in the film is one between Patsy and Nicola in which they finally have a confrontation. So much of what I have said is explained in just this one scene. Patsy does have an inner core, she can be serious and Nicola can be reached, whether she wants to admit it or not. Somebody should have gotten an Academy Award nomination just for this scene.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like this the first time, then give it a second try. I think it will grow on you.",

Too bad."

      "reviewBody": "This movie makes the cardinal sin of trying to mix light, slapstick comedy with extremely graphic, gory, brutal violence. It is merely a rip off of the Die Hard movie with an element of any Jerry Lewis movie thrown in for kicks. The plot revolves around the Jet-Li character who lost his wife to the diabolical mad bomber known as &quot;The Doctor&quot;. He becomes employed  as a bodyguard to a Jackie Chan type Action Movie Star who is a drunken, lazy bum. At one time, the movie states he had real skills, but lost them with fame. Anyhow they all get trapped by the terrorists in a skyscraper and that is when you get Jet Li taking on the terrorists with the aid of a nerdy looking cop, a plucky female newscaster, and the Jacky character and his dad. My favorite villian is the Valerie Chow character who is this super sexy, karate kicking, weapon toting ultra vixen who makes the other beautiful actresses look like naked human turds. The movie is not very good. Lots of gunfire, explosions, gruesome killings, and noise. I have seen better Jet Li movies."

      "reviewBody": "Of all the recent remakes of Japanese horror films, I have to say that Dark Water is the only remake that actually surpasses the original. I think the reason that so many people are so hard on it is because they went in expecting to see THE RING or THE GRUDGE. They went in expecting to see a scary ghost movie. Dark Water is not really a horror movie, at least not in the traditional sense. It&apos;s actually more of a drama set in a haunted apartment complex. If you go in expecting to have stuff jump out at you, you will be disappointed.\n\nIt&apos;s sad that everyone expects horror films to have a bunch of jump scares in them these days. Whatever happened to the slow buildup of tension and paranoia of something like ROSEMARY&apos;S BABY? If you go into Dark Water expecting something more akin to Rosemary&apos;s Baby or a Hitchcock thriller, you might just end up enjoying this film.\n\nAs far as comparing this remake to the original, I will say that I felt that Jennifer Connelly was a much more compelling character than the mother in the original movie. Overall, the characters were fleshed out better. I understood the conflict between the mother, the father and the little girl much more in the remake. The original just sort of glanced over many of these details. Some of the shots were actually more effective than the ones in the original, and the ending in the remake is more satisfying and better executed than in the original. Generally, I think that J-horror is better left in its original incarnation. As much as I liked the Western version of THE RING, I felt like the only reason they remade it was to cast Naomi Watts as the lead. THE GRUDGE, they should have left that one alone. Nothing was gained by Sarah Michelle Gellar. But this one, this one is actually better than the Japanese original in my opinion.\n\nThis movie is not for everyone. It is a slow, poignant drama set in a really creepy location. It would probably play well in a double feature with ROSEMARY&apos;S BABY. If you want to have stuff jump out at you, watch THE GRUDGE. If you want to watch a movie that has a little more depth to it, watch DARK WATER.",

Then there also is a truck-driver, who is a friend of the wild woman,and he falls in love with the older woman.By that time her life isn&apos;t what it used to be anymore!\n\nThe acting was very good,especially Marisa Tomei was great as Monica Warren,the little boy&apos;s mom! Also I very much liked Gerard Depardieu as the truck-driver,but then again, he is always funny. Jake Lloyd put on a great show too,as &quot;JJ&quot; Warren,and also I liked the acting of daughter Annie (Moira Kelly)!\n\nOverall this is a nice drama/comedy!",

When I think of flesh Water&apos;s star Divine - i have to admit - Waters saved some of that gore effect that Herschell has in his films. The effect of real fleshy gore!"

This tells the tale of an offer from hitch about making a film with him. But... just then, monaco and france are having a conflict over taxes; monaco does not tax new corporations, so many french companies are moving there, resulting in less tax income for france. This was one roadblock. At the same time, word has leaked out that the royal princess, mother to the royal heirs, may be part of a rough, violent hitchcock film back in the states. And there is political intrigue, where backroom deals are being made regarding the future of monaco that almost no-one knew about... can grace go make a movie in the united states with all this going on? History has already told us what happens... frank langella co-stars as tuck, her advisor. Tim roth as ranier. The trivia section tells us there are three different cuts of the film, so which version is shown appears to be the luck of the draw. Directed by olivier dahan. Written by arash amel. It&apos;s pretty well done, even if the royal family says there are in-accuracies.",

A neat ending which suited the tone of the rest of the film. Emma Cohen was good in the sole female role, and convincing enough to be scared and unsure of the all male cast. The snowy settings were a good addition, although I agree that the music was too repetitive, and the dubbing unconvincing. But as a macho western, this flick sure kicks arse!....quite disturbing in places. A sort of &apos;And Then There Were None&apos; for grown ups! The type of movie that would not get made today, and a great addition to any exploitation collectors collection.",

      "reviewBody": "In the late sixties Bava began reinventing the murder mystery formula he single-handedly created with films like THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and BLOOD AND BLACK LACE.  In this film you know from the start who the killer is and so this film becomes a look into the crazed mind of a guy with childhood trauma who kills women.  There&apos;s a great experimental score, cool fashions and a dance nightclub sequence for all you Sixties kitsch fans out there. Stephen Forsyth gives a great wide-eyed psycho performance and Bava forsakes his usual stylishly colored lighting for dreamy surreal imagery during the murder scenes.  Bava even sticks in scenes from his earlier films on a TV as an in-joke for his fans.",

The movie is very true to the games and for those who have played the games will be happy to know that Metal Gear Solid: Philanthropy stays in the same style and tone as the games. The CGI is very good for a fan movie and so is the acting even though it&apos;s been dubbed is still very good, Snake&apos;s voice and even his personality is exactly the same as he is in the games.\n\nFans of the games should definitely watch Metal Gear Solid: Philanthropy as they would enjoy this movie and for non fans would probably see this as another low budget Sci-Fi flick. This is the best fan film based on a video game I have seen so far.\n\nI&apos;ve only seen Part 1 of Metal Gear Solid: Philanthropy which only has a 60 minute runtime and I still look forward to part 2 and 3 when it comes.\n\n9/10",

This is the shortest of the three featurettes found on the 2-Disc George Lucas Director&apos;s Cut DVD version of THX 1138, released in 2004, with a running time of just over 8 minutes. This starts with a short interview between the maker of Star Wars and Francis Ford Coppola(in which we begin to think that this will, indeed, be a genuine &quot;making of&quot; production, but this impression will not last; I suppose if I had to classify this, it&apos;s a sort of experimental movie, and it&apos;s good from a technical standpoint), and at the end of it, as a non sequitor(maybe he couldn&apos;t come up with an answer, I don&apos;t know), the &quot;father&quot;(no, not Sean Connery) of Indiana Jones says that he has this great idea &quot;about shaving everybody&apos;s heads&quot;. The conversation instantly degenerates(I guess this was trying to say &quot;yes, we know this is weird&quot;, and hoping to provoke interest in it, I don&apos;t know), and it cuts to, well, a ton of footage of people having all of their hair cut off, and they either react verbally or we hear their &quot;thoughts&quot; dubbed over it. Oh, and one of the girls, afterwards, passes a couple of Hare Krishnas on the street. There are behind the scenes shots and clips of the film(some of them contain spoilers for it). That&apos;s... it. I&apos;m not sure what was trying to be accomplished here, other than firsting every audience member and reviewer in pointing out that the actors are bald and that that&apos;s unusual. There is a little disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who this appeals to. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Opium War is an historical event that heralded the beginning of the end for the Qing Dynasty and the Chinese Empire as a whole. However, despite its name, the roots of Opium War do not only lie in the drug or its addiction. Opium, corruption, mismanagement, and a gross underestimate of the West&apos;s projection power are only some of the many complex reasons that led to the First Opium War.\n\nIn Yapian Zhanzheng (Opium War), historical events are depicted in a fairly accurate manner, concentrating on the main facts and events. Different aspects of the situation are presented: the Emperor&apos;s dilemmas, British/Western interests, Commissioner Lin&apos;s character, the opium merchant, the corrupt officials, etc... The film however lacks depth and emotion. The viewer is kept on the outside, and cannot identify with any character, bar young He who is forced into the story so as to add a human dimension to the story.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the film also tends to simplify certain aspects of the situation. One would think that there only were half a dozen merchants in Canton, and that the whole war was caused by Captain Elliott. The power of merchants and their trade is briefly mentioned, but only incidentally, as are power politics at the Imperial Court and at Parliament, internal turmoil, national and international political strategy, and many other factors that led to the War.\n\nOverall, viewing of this film is recommended to gain a overview of major events; certain scenes are also quite spectacular. But do not watch for an in-depth historical analysis or representation of the Opium War.",

      "reviewBody": "Always is a landmark film in Steven Spielberg&apos;s canon for more than one reason. It would be the first time Spielberg would adapt someone else&apos;s work, and also it would see Spielberg caught in transition between bidding farewell to childhood memories and a crowd pleasing necessity. In fact it is not too bold to say that without Always, Spielberg could not have progressed into the superlative director he most assuredly is. Often wrongly thought of as a Spielberg flop, it actually grossed $74,134,790 worldwide, that&apos;s three times what it cost to make. Always is awash with sentimentality, the kind that Spielberg detractors use to constantly berate the director as being his safe haven calling card, yet it&apos;s an oddly tender movie about loss, love and the need to move on from former yearnings. Working from the excellent original source by Dalton Trumbo called A Guy Named Joe, Spielberg crafts his tale with deftly visual flourishes aiding the sweet nature of the piece, none more so than when Audrey Hepburn arrives {in her last film appearance} as Pete&apos;s angel guide, Hap.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss takes the lead role of Pete Sandwich, with both he and Spielberg sharing a passion for A Guy Named Joe. So much so that Spielberg honoured a promise to Dreyfuss back in the Jaws days that he would cast him should he ever remake the film. Holly Hunter takes on the pivotal female lead of Dorinda and does brilliant work, all doe eyed beauty fusing with tight emotion that has the discerning viewer eating out of her hands. John Goodman is suitably ebullient as Al Yackey, with Spielberg framing him rather well in certain scenic sequences, while the only weak link in the film is probably Brad Johnson as Ted Baker, but time has been kind to his performance and it doesn&apos;t quite jar as much as it used too. The critics hated it on release and the watching public were most indifferent to it as well. Yet it&apos;s definitely one to revisit as we all get older, be it with a loved one or during times of reflection. You obviously can&apos;t get away from the sentimental aspects of it, but sometimes sentiment is a necessity to smooth out those rough edges. Charming, delightful and a real important film in Steven Spielberg&apos;s career. 7/10",

It had runaway ambition and intrigue and sincere portrayals of betrayal, romantic and otherwise. This film doesn&apos;t amount to even a fraction of what the book was and in no way deserves to bear its name.\n\nHonourable Mentions: The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).

It had a good story, amazing action sequences, and a good combination of action and comedy (what Jackie does so well). the fight scene on top of the building is the best fight scene i&apos;ve ever seen. what makes it the best is how real it is, today&apos;s movies&apos; fight scenes are full of wires and quick cuts in editing to confuse the audience into thinking there&apos;s more going on. this fight had amazing stunts with guys who really knew what they were doing, with Jackie&apos;s trademark funny expressions mixed in. By far JC&apos;s best, and I didn&apos;t even say anything about the car stunts.",

This is basically a subtle comedy with some good characters, good acting, and good directing. The script is a bit confusing at times as one tries to figure out exactly what is going on, but for the most part everything holds together.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t call this a great movie or even a &quot;good&quot; movie, but it was fun enough to hold attention for a couple of hours. I came close to giving this 7 stars, but there simply wasn&apos;t much that stood out here to make this special. Six stars is my &quot;better than most&quot; rating, which is about where this sits. The actors and the characters they play are the best part, so kudos to them. All in all it&apos;s worth the watch.",

When a wanted criminal is on the run, he stumbles into Roger and police soon arrive to arrest the crook....and suddenly Roger is a hero. Surprisingly, soon the governor appoints Roger as the special prosecutor (since, apparently, he is a lawyer). Apparently, some criminal underground is alive and well...and the current prosecutor hasn&apos;t been able to turn up any evidence.\n\nConsidering that Roger only became famous by accident (and he was more than willing to admit this), expectations for him are low. However, Roger is earnest and not nearly as inept as everyone expects. So what DOES he do? Well, when the underground seems unstoppable, he does what any government official would do....he breaks the law in order to uphold it!\n\nOverall, this is a very interesting film....not brilliant but certainly better than the average cheap B-movie...which it is.",

      "reviewBody": "I actually have to say this film didn&apos;t do it for me!!! Hands down Della Reese had to have been the funniest in the movie but she had such a small role. There were a lot of flaws in the continuity....some of the time frames just didn&apos;t match up with background. Sharon Stone&apos;s character was extremely funny at the beginning but it wore off really fast as it started to get very annoying. There were a couple of parts where they could have cut out and I am thinking WHAT THE HECK IS THIS ANYWAY....they must be related to either the director or the crew somehow to get them a small part but towards the end these two characters kept popping up and its like ENOUGH ALREADY....these characters did not go with this movie whatsoever...they had to be written in at the last minute.\n\nBut I have to say the concept was very original but needed some extreme help!!!!!! I say go directly to cable.....not wide screen theater material....which is very said because I love Sharon Stone and Whoopi!! Not trying to be cruel but I just don&apos;t see this making harding any money financially.",

The movie has 5 different stories but they all have to do with something erotic, some maybe more intriguing than others. So basically it&apos;s a anthology film that is mainly centered on the theme of &quot;Eros&quot;, even if the characters in each segments aren&apos;t really connected. Although the movie can be a bit awkward at times, it also doves into the human psychology. Since some stories are more interesting and intriguing than others and it really isn&apos;t a artsy film either although it seems to try, overall it just wasn&apos;t that great, but ain&apos;t terrible either.\n\n5/10",

Not sure why there has been so many bad reviews and a lot of self-righteous comments--but they need to check their politics at the door, and for goodness sake--just have fun, people. Can&apos;t we just enjoy it? Why does it have to be so complicated? I can think of a million other things that are much worse--than this Peter Rabbit film, which by the way, there is nothing wrong with Peter Rabbit 3.0. Go see it. You&apos;re going to love it, as much as I would&apos;ve felt the original author would have too, as this is based on her tale for kids, but it is technically a sequel--as you will understand when you see it. First off, they are rabbits, and rabbits are mischievous by nature, when they are bored or there is food at stake. They are also a bit affectionately demanding and territorial as they felt with Bea. Within the context of the film, rabbits don&apos;t understand what the implications of allergic reactions could be for humans--they are, yes, rabbits. The humor is just hilarious, and it works well coming from farm animals. This is CGI/A vs. real live humans. It kept me engaged throughout. I saw this one with my daughter and we both laughed so much and so hard -- isn&apos;t this what it is all about? a positive experience? One that brings you closer with those you are with? I cried, I laughed, I cried so hard I laughed, and laughed so hard I cried -- and this is how I rate/gauge film I watch -- by how it moves me and the positivity it inspires in me; it felt good to be reminded that I was still human. I just loved, loved, loved this film. I recommend it. This one will definitely make it into my collection once it is released in media format -- and not many make it in. The soundtrack is super amazing too--I can&apos;t stress that enough. They hit it on the head with this one. A TRUE STORY OF HUMBLENESS AND REDEMPTION. Your heart will melt into a big puddle--hands down. No one is paying me to write this--I give it 10 Gold stars. I want to see Peter win next year at the Oscars. A TOTAL GEM.",

He reveals himself as a practitioner of the dark occult arts, who takes over their home and takes on a venomous blood lust to survive. Years later, two brothers are driven back to the house he stayed at on a mission of personal revenge, only to find the real perpetrator come back to life and try to exact his venom on them.\n\nThis is the &apos;latest&apos; Joel Schumacher film that it would seem has actually been held back for two years and appears to have arrived straight to DVD on these shores. His last (and most recent) foray into the horror genre The Number 23 with Jim Carrey was a rockety, shambolic road indeed that showed a pretty decent (if never great) director veering off course a bit, but Blood Creek is sadly evidence of a past it hack who&apos;s gone over the hill.\n\nAn unfathomable mess, the story is a ridiculous, convoluted mess, opening in a pretentious black and white film noir style before flitting the story to the present day and back into colour again, with a plot that&apos;s lost you about twenty minutes in, marred with a blurry, slap shot filming style that&apos;s even with the even more shambolic story, before finally revealing a villain that seems like Freddy Kruegger with a liver problem.\n\nIt&apos;s all just a nonsensical, sad revalation of a director who&apos;s deteriorated into what could at best be called senility and at worst madness. *"

Is true that the details are a little bad and is true that seems everything is too rushed but just don&apos;t think like the herd. I can find many errors in The Gladiator but that doesn&apos;t mean is BAD. If you like fantasy movies you should see this movie.\n\n(comments here need a little more objectivity - i&apos;m really not interested to come on IMDb and read 30 comments with phrases like &quot;i think this director is so bad - he should stop hurting people!&quot;. be mature and serious when comment please.)",

      "reviewBody": "The film presents itself as a personal essay, not a history lesson. It manages to be both.\n\nAs part of the 400th anniversary celebrations of Québec, the National Battlefield Commission planned a huge re-enactment of the Battle of the plains of Abraham. This week the planned re-enactment of the battle for its anniversary was canceled because of controversy brought about by nationalist political agenda. It is a shame they were not able to see events in their historic perspective with the maturity Godbout brings here.\n\nThe film revisits the battle of the Plains of Abraham as the filmmaker, one of Quebec&apos;s best of the previous generation, goes back to one of the sacred cows of the history books. Jacques Godbout tells an anecdote in the film about his father, who died two years before filming. His dad brought up the battle as the date that defined french people in North America. Godbout felt compelled to try to understand this most mis-understood of events.\n\nWhat actually happened in New France on the plains of Abraham Martin (a name that came much later by the way) ? Godbout visits England, France and the capital of Quebec with love and humor, reconstructing a portrait of the battle and analyzing its importance for all of America. He interviews descendants of the two main military players, Wolfe and Montcalm.\n\nThough the film seems a little gimmicky at times, it manages to keep the audience engaged and amused throughout.",

      "reviewBody": "Spaghetti/Chorizo filmed in Spain , as usual , and in the film appears ordinary actors of this exciting sub-genre . It deal with a Texas Ranger sergeant called Bob Logan (George Martin) who is assigned by his chief (Jose Nieto) to track down Cassidy (Alan Scott) , an alleged killer , long time ago they were friends . Both of whom join forces to take down a powerful land lady , Linda Ranson , (Silvia Solar) who is taking lands from humble farmers . Meanwhile , her hoodlums (José Jaspe , Luis Induni , Frank Braña , Aldo Sambrell) are attacking a farm whose owner is Mary Sheridan (Susy Andersen) ,then Logan and Cassidy help her to vanquish the nasty henchmen . Later on , Logan falls in love with the gorgeous Mary and both of whom suffer hot pursuits , risks and dangers . \n\nIt is a middling western that packs a story full of action , fights , killings and subsequent suspense , passable dramatic pace , plot twists and regular direction . This is effortless and below average story in Paella Western sub-genre style with customary ingredients but results to be a little bit boring and dull . It contains an intriguing premise , a Texas Ranger sergeant to chase his old friend , wrongly accused for killing , and results to be moderately entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . Tiring though sometimes agreeable Chorizo-Spaghetti Western mostly produced by Italy and important Spanish participation , shot by the Italian craftsman Primo Zeglio ; it doesn&apos;t follows the Sergio Leone wake , and being proceeded in American style . There is action in the movie , intrigue , twists , riding pursuits , and guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts . It&apos;s a thrilling western with exciting showdown between the starring Jorge Martin , Alan Scott and their enemies . Average action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly deadly crossfire . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , George or Jorge Martin is acceptable in his usual tough role . The film is well starred by Spaghetti star as the Spanish George Martin who worked much for Alfonso Balcazar&apos;s factory such as ¨Clint the strange¨, ¨The return the Clint¨, ¨Oeste Nevada Joe¨, Thompson 1880¨ , ¨Taste of killing¨, ¨A pistol for Ringo and ¨The return of Ringo¨ . Co-protagonist Alan Scott starred another Paella Western titled ¨Cavalry Charge¨ or Policia Montada Del Canada¨ . Furthermore , there appears ordinary secondaries of Spaghetti/Tortilla Western as Spanish players : Luis Induni , Aldo Sambrell , Alfonso De La Vega , Chris Huerta , Antonio Molino Rojo , Angel Menéndez , Fernando Sanchez Polack , Pimentel , as Italian actors : Andrea Scotti , Petrucci , Paola Barbara , director&apos;s wife , and many others . Enjoyable though brief performance by the always great Aldo Sambrell , known for ¨For a fistful of dollars¨ , playing a nasty role , as usual . The picture well photographed by Alfredo Fraile , though is necessary a fine remastering because the film-copy is washed-out . Being filmed on location in Las Rozas , Manzanares , Navacerrada Madrid and Fraga Huesca . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Francesco De Massi , including catching leitmotif.\n\nThe pic was written by Spaghetti experts writers such as Marcello Fondato, Jesús Navarro and Federico De Urrutia ; being regularly directed by Primo Zeglio , under pseudonym of Anthony Greepy . Primo was married to Paola Barbara who usually plays his films in secondary roles . He was a good professional , a craftsman who wrote and directed all kind of genres as Adventure : &quot;Seven Seas to Calais&quot; , ¨Genoneva De Bravante¨ , &quot;Revenge of the Pirates&quot;, &quot;Son of the Red Corsair&quot; ¨, ¨Captain Ghost¨, ¨Morgan the pirate¨ , Sci-Fi : &quot;Mission Stardust&quot; , Peplum : &quot;I Am Semiramis&quot; , ¨Nero and Messalina¨ , ¨Rosmunda e Alboino¨ and Spaghetti : &quot;&quot;The Relentless Four¨, &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; and this ¨Winchester One of One Thousand¨ also titled ¨Winchester Justice¨.",

Juliette Binoche is an actress who after acting as Mary in a film about the life of Jesus is struck by religious fervor and apparently starts identifying herself wit the the Bible character. Forest Whitaker is a religious TV host who does not seem to care to much about God, but when disaster strikes his personal life he remembers Him and starts praying and believing - are we supposed to believe as viewers that this sincere? The film about Jesus starts some kind of controversy which seems to refer to Mel Gibson, but the real Mel Gibson as much as I may not like him is certainly sincere in his beliefs, and does not look like the cynical character in this film. Although &apos;Mary&apos; lasts only 83 minutes the screen time is too long, so it is filled up with scenes of the biblical story (from the film in the film, or trying to convey some confuse metaphor? who cares?) and an episode of a Jewish Passover celebration in Jerusalem interrupted by an act of terror with no connection whatever with the rest of the story.\n\nIt is hard to grasp why this film was made, what is it really trying to say and why actors like Juliette Binoche and the now-Oscared Forest Whitaker got involved with it. They act well, but it&apos;s wasted talent. Unless you are a fan of Bible inspired films, there is no good reason to spend the time seeing it.",

      "reviewBody": "As a kid, little Vijay, while hiding in a wardrobe, witnessed his parents&apos; assassination by Teja, a man who was a member of a mafia group Vijay&apos;s father was a part of and retired. Vijay was adopted by a police officer and as he grew up, he himself became a hot-blooded policeman. Vijay does not remember Teja. He only vaguely remembers the murderer&apos;s golden chain with a white horse hanging on it.\n\nThat&apos;s the story of Prakash Mehra&apos;s Zanjeer, an action-packed drama and one of the first films which shot the leading actor Amitabh Bachchan to fame. Zanjeer is an entertaining movie, and the story is interesting and well told. The direction is also pretty good. The characters are well-written. Bachchan&apos;s character is that of a very serious and uncompromising young man who takes crime as a personal affront and is thus often put in trouble with his superiors.\n\nThe film has several actors supporting Bachchan, including Jaya Bhaduri, his real-life future-wife, who plays the sassy and lovely Mala. The chemistry between the two is wonderful as always. Pran, also an actor who frequently collaborated with Bachchan, plays Sher Khan, a kind-hearted, brave and smart man who befriends Vijay in some unusual circumstances and supports him in every step throughout the film. Om Prakash also appears in a small but important role of a drunkard who is also Vijay&apos;s informant.\n\nBachchan is excellent as Vijay. It&apos;s easy to see why this was a star-turning performance for this towering actor. He is restrained and inhibited and brilliantly displays his character&apos;s internal turmoil and fear. Jaya Bhaduri is absolutely charming and natural as Mala, and it&apos;s nice to see her transform so convincingly from a vivacious girl to a mature and supportive wife. Pran is brilliant in his rather unusual role. Om Prakash is good in his role of a traumatised man. Bindu makes her usual vamp act, and Ajit is okay as Teja.\n\nZanjeer is an enjoyable and well-made film. It is at times a bit unsettling and disturbing but it is generally well-executed, well-narrated and well-acted. The film&apos;s music is also very nice, though the cabaret number was a bit annoying. I liked it that no songs were given to Bachchan. It only contributed to his serious image in the film. In its favour it can also be said that the film is devoid of too much melodrama, though it is not very realistic in the last portions. Anyway, this is a good, classic Hindi movie, I recommend you to watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "People have talked and talked about the revolution within Norwegian films for a few years now. That everything has become so much better. In my opinion, most of the films produced in the last few years, within this so-called revolution, has been the same old stories and concepts that Norway has made from day one, except the productions has become better. I have visited the theater for basically every new Norwegian film, with high hopes and a wanting to like what they show, and every time I walk out disappointed and with less hope for our present generation of filmmakers. This all changed today. I went to the premiere of Fritt Vilt expecting a nice slasher film, and I walked out 95 minutes later, with hope restored and a nice smile on my face. I actually felt good.\n\nThe film is a slasher film, through and through, and that is both one of it&apos;s strengths, but also it&apos;s weakness. The film contains basically every little slasher movie clichè you can think of. It&apos;s just they do it so very well. It is a genre film and it doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the concept, but it&apos;s fresh for us Norwegians. The film doesn&apos;t try to be anything more than a good horror film.\n\nThe setting is excellent. An old abandoned hotel in the middle of nowhere up in the mountains. The back story is not exactly original, but it works well enough to pull of some really scary scenes. The look and feel of the hotel and the isolation is all there, and the evil that is lurking sure is creepy.\n\nRoar Uthaug does a few neat tricks early in the movie, which makes you sit at the edge of your seat through out the film, and his direction is good. The script is good enough for a horror story, but sometimes, especially in the opening scene, the dialoges are pretty campy and lame. But they redeem themselves quickly when the sh#% hits the fan.\n\nThe acting is excellent from most of the cast. I hope we&apos;ll see a lot more of Ingrid Bolsø Berdal in other films. Having her in the lead was a smart move. I would also like to credit Rolf Kristian Larsen. He had some funny commentaries and face expressions. The weakest actor, and at times so bad it was annoying, was Endre Martin Midtstigen. I&apos;m not sure why he was in the movie. He must know someone in the production team, cause he has no acting talents what so ever.\n\nA creepy horror film from Norway, and one of our finest films in recent years. I hope to see more of Roar Uthaug in the near future. I think this is a director with much to come. Also Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, we want more of you! Keep Up The Good Work!",

      "reviewBody": "Director Faith Akin is often called one of the most important contemporary German directors to have emerged in recent years. Soul Kitchen is Akin&apos; highly anticipated first attempt at a genuine comedy. So far Akin has been has been more involved in the fields of drama and romance. In a recent interview he revealed he was curious to explore a more varied range of film genres which sounds like an interesting plan. In venice this year, the film was celebrated by the audiences and scored the special jury price.\n\nThe story revolves around a restaurant/club called Soul Kitchen and the troublesome life of its respectful owner Zinos. He has to overcome many struggles involving his girlfriend, his brother and the authorities. The film is set in the heart of the diverse northern German city of Hamburg, the home turf of the two scribes Faith Akin and Adam Bousdoukos.\n\nThe makers of the film call it a new take on the idea of the &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; - a rather preconceived loose genre which basically defines a film to have been made in the makers home country and dealing with issues relating to home and identity.\n\nAkin described how he studied classical sketches by Charlie Chaplin and also looked at his method of working. A simple &quot;joke&quot; that comes off easy and natural on screen had been reworked over and over. For some of the scenes Akin admittedly said he had to shoot 30 takes before it felt right. This made him doubt his own abilities but in the end let him grow as a filmmaker and as an individual.\n\nThe result is a stellar solid performance by the entire cast. Many jokes and payoffs will unfortunately and without a doubt get lost in translation but still the timing and heartblood of the actors will still capture anyone&apos;s attention.\n\nAkin makes use of a couple of his &quot;regulars&quot;: Adam Bousdoukos, Moritz Bleibtreu and the great Birol Ünel but also introduces fresh unknown blood with the two female leads Lucia Faust and Nadine Krüger.\n\nHaving just seen another film recently I noticed myself how well this film is balanced out in comparison. There is a rhythm, a beat or a harmony. The soundtrack and editing allow the plot to flow organically and let the narrative play out smoothly. Interestingly Akin once mentioned that since &quot;Gegen die Wand&quot; (Head On, 2004) he is inspired by the songs used in his films in a visual way and sets out a soundtrack before the filming is finished.\n\nThe film marks Akin&apos;s first shot at wider levels of improvisation. Normally, he said in an interview with a German radio station, he has the script all planned out in detail; all the actors know what their dialogues are and maybe one or two things get changed, with feedback from the people on set but this time a lot of things were left undone on purpose to grow naturally out of the situations.\n\nWhat I personally enjoyed a lot about Soul Kitchen is the way in which the film addresses its urban environment. Akin took a chance to shoot in a wide range of locations, many of which such the club &quot;Mojo&quot; have since closed down. It attempts to capture the spirit of the city at a point in time and successfully tells an emotional, personal story.\n\nRecommended to anyone with a passion for fresh, clever and funny stories of life and the city.",

The movie isn&apos;t presented as a serious drama or even a serious comedy and one gets the impression that all the recognizable actors in it knew this in advance. After all, I hope they read the script prior to shooting.\n\n The movie begins with the typical horror genre; Four girls are hired to stay and clean a very large, but abandoned house. While cleaning, one of them finds a creepy looking book covered in real skin that contains pornographic images of cartoons and is written entirely in Latin. And wouldn&apos;t you know it, the geeky girl knows just enough Latin to get them all into trouble. As with any movie that ends up on the B listing, there could have been many improvements that would have made this movie better - but too late now - I doubt any of the actors will do a sequel.\n\nIn short, don&apos;t expect too much more than a lot of good laughs accompanied by the shaking of your head. The movie is well worth the $5 rental fee."

      "reviewBody": "I recently read the book series (out of boredom), so I saw this film today with my friend. Firstly, it is quite different from the book. A major part of the storyline was completely left out (or even discarded), some parts were removed, and random parts added that did nothing for the storyline whatsoever. The beginning of the movie felt rather rushed, and hearing the &apos;whhaat?&apos; from my friend confirmed the fact that they don&apos;t really explain things much in the first place. Anyone who might&apos;ve recently studied Greek mythology or like to read about it as a general interest..it might make more sense to. Otherwise, it would seem a little random.\n\nI&apos;m never impressed when movies make changes from the books that don&apos;t greatly benefit the storyline. Unfortunately this was the case, with several things being completely different. But, if you&apos;ve not read the books, you won&apos;t know any better. Still, I think keeping with the original storyline would&apos;ve been fine, and definitely wouldn&apos;t have made the movie longer if done properly.\n\nI honestly thought the acting was excellent from all of them, and there are quite a few laughs along the way.\n\nI&apos;m giving this a 6. It wasn&apos;t great, but it wasn&apos;t bad either. It should&apos;ve been better. I doubt they&apos;ll continue to make the other books into movies, much like they&apos;ve completely botched the movie versions of my favourite books (His Dark Materials), but considering a major part of the plot was removed, it doesn&apos;t really matter much.",

      "name": "A solid and entertaining silent film by the father of French cinema, Jean Renoir",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Nana&quot; (1926) is the third film by the great Jean Renoir. I&apos;ve been unable to find his first film, which he co-directed with another filmmaker, but having seen his second film and solo debut, &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Whirlpool of Fate&quot;; 1925), I was a bit surprised by &quot;Nana&quot;, for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, there&apos;s the star of both films, Catherine Hessling. In &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot;, she played an innocent young girl, and she did so about as well as could be expected, given how almost absurdly overdrawn her character was in terms of virtue and purity. In &quot;Nana&quot;, suffice it to say, her role is a bit different. She plays a tart, a prostitute. Once again, her character is ridiculously exaggerated, caricatured to an absolutely laughable extent. Here, however, unlike in Renoir&apos;s last film, Hessling does nothing to help matters. Her acting in &quot;Nana&quot; is so over the top that it at times becomes a marked hindrance to the integrity of the film. I would expect this kind of performance in a Keystone comedy from 1914, maybe, but not from a Renoir film in the latter half of the &apos;20s. \n\nFurthermore, the narrative breaks down into tragic melodrama in the latter portion of the film, and any thematic substance from the first half of the film is ultimately diluted in the perceived necessities of plot and story. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected; it&apos;s common of so many silents from this era.\n\nThat, however, is about the extent of my criticism for the film. It&apos;s a good film, overall, or at least a solid one. In some ways it surpasses &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot;, and in other ways it falls short of it. The narrative in &quot;Nana&quot; is stronger than its predecessor&apos;s: The characters are more complex and less archetypal, and the themes are more pronounced while they last. To venture further into the subjective, I&apos;d say that &quot;Nana&quot; has higher entertainment value than Renoir&apos;s last film, and that it&apos;s more dramatically engaging.\n\nOn the other hand, there was an element of visual poetry in &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot; that is missing from &quot;Nana&quot;. Perhaps it&apos;s the issue of color tinting, at least in part. I&apos;ve always felt that color tinting degrades a film&apos;s artistic value. &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot; was not tinted, and it preserved a certain artistry in the film&apos;s aesthetic that the tinted images in &quot;Nana&quot; simply can not match. I will concede, though, that if Renoir is going to insist on color tinting, the tinting in &quot;Nana&quot; is handled well — a series of similarly toned warm tints, providing a more consistent visual mood than, for instance, the messy rainbow of colors from all parts of the visible spectrum in Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;The Spiders&quot; films. \n\n&quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot; also featured impressive montage, and one wonders where the editing talents displayed in that film disappeared to for &quot;Nana&quot;. That&apos;s not to say that &quot;Nana&quot; is poorly edited, but simply that it doesn&apos;t exhibit the noticeably skilled use of montage that we saw in the former film. Renoir is credited for the editing in &quot;Nana&quot;, whereas I can&apos;t find a credit for the editing in &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot;, so it&apos;s possible that it wasn&apos;t Renoir&apos;s editing talents that we saw in that film, although I&apos;m still willing to guess that it was.\n\nFinally, &quot;La fille de l&apos;eau&quot; gets a nudge for a fantastic dream sequence that I&apos;m sure anyone who saw the film will remember. But enough contrasting. There are certainly similarities as well. The most obvious place where the two films can be compared is in their social inclinations. Both films, and for that matter every Renoir film I&apos;ve ever seen, feature a blending of characters from different social classes. &quot;Boudu Saved From Drowning&quot;, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;, &quot;The Diary of a Chambermaid&quot;, &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; — Renoir loves to throw lower class characters and upper class characters into the same setting and see what comes of it. It&apos;s his way of exploring his humanist disposition. Other filmmakers have done it in their own way. Kurosawa liked to look to the lower classes alone to find the true nature of humanity. Visconti, though not exactly a humanist, liked to look largely to the upper classes to explore human nature. Renoir likes to look at both, together — the coexistence of the two in a particular setting — and he defines humanity through the shared qualities, as well as the conflicts, that arise under those conditions.\n\n&quot;Nana&quot; is a very much a male film, in that, like Luis Buñuel, there is a focus on the power of the female, and the manner in which a woman can trigger a maelstrom of chaos in the lives of the men who fall at her feet, and who set aside everything — even that most precious social status and respectability — in order to attain the object of their passion. This theme has the potential to be feminist, of course, but not here. The film&apos;s sympathies are almost entirely with the despairing male characters, and the female tantalizer is depicted as an absolutely ridiculous human being (although she is ultimately afforded a small degree of humanity).\n\nOn a side note, there&apos;s a role in &apos;Nana&quot; for Werner Krauss, the German actor who appeared in films like Wiene&apos;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and Pabst&apos;s &quot;The Joyless Street&quot;. He&apos;s good. In fact, excluding Catherine Hessling, the whole cast is pretty good.\n\nThe film is made by a fairly young and inexperienced Jean Renoir, and yet it is clearly the work of a professional. Renoir was not the master of the cinema that he would later become, but already he was a good filmmaker, and his talent for storytelling is evident even this early in his career.\n\nRATING: 6.00 out of 10 stars",

      "reviewBody": "CAPOTE, first of all, is a well written film by the talented Dan Futterman, whose performance in URBANIA we will always remember, and for Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is his &quot;Golden Globe and Oscar Award&quot; all in one. From the first scene, Hoffman creates the essence of the acid tongued, tremendously talented, yet damaged, Truman Capote.\n\nHaving read IN COLD BLOOD when it first came out, CAPOTE really captures on the screen the horror of what took place on that Kansas farm and the cinematography, costumes and locations are wonderful to behold. Miss Keener&apos;s performance is such a subtle and intelligent contrast to the hysteria of Capote, and his perfect foil.\n\nIn the scenes with Perry Smith, they are haunting and disturbing, as if it feels like two cobras are circling one another, waiting for the first one to strike. And in this context, I ask, &quot;2 Capote, or NOT 2 Capote?, that is the question&quot;, because both are on the take-Smith to use Capote for obtaining a pardon, Capote, to nail the story that will gain him the adulation he so adores. And then, Capote slides downhill, while Perry rots in prison.\n\nCAPOTE captures the essence of the 1950&apos;s, the horror of a brutal killing in the vast farmlands of Kansas, and delivers a knock out performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. If only IN COLD BLOOD had not seemed like a manipulation by a writer out for glory at the expense of a prisoner who believed in him.",

      "reviewBody": "This one deals with an anchorite : Fernando Fernan Gómez, living more than 11 years in a boisterous bathroom . It is a sort of apartment where he receives guests and a lot of strange visitors . He sends messages through the toilet hole by throwing aspirin tubes, finally a young girl : Martine Audo picks it up and she then becomes a new visitor deciding to live with him.\n\nStrange and outlandish comedy , in which Fernando Fernando Gómez gives a terrific acting . He plays an anchorite with limited contacts out of his lively room , his relation with people are reduced to visitors who eventually show up . It is an outlandish flick in shoestring budget with script from prestigious Rafael Azcona and director Juan Stelrich himself , in fact the only set results to be the bustling bathroom . Being based on The Tentation of Saint Antoine 1874 wriiten by Gustave Flaubert of Madame Bovary and regarding as well as paying tribute to Simon of the Desert 1965 directed by the great Luis Buñuel. The film is passable thanks to the excellent interpretations , exception for the gorgeous French co-starring Martine Audo of brief career , providing a lousy and wooden interpretation along with brief nudism scenes , being her voice dubbed . Support cast is frankly excellent with notorious Spanish secondaries as Charo Soriano, Marisol Ayuso , Angel Álvarez, Isabel Mestres, Pedro Beltran, Rafael Albaicin, Luis Ciges , Sergio Mendizabal , Ricardo Lillo, Fernando Sanchez Polack, among others . And being a Spain/France coproduction , also appearing the French actor Claude Dauphin.\n\nIt contains an adequate and atmospheric cinematography by Alejandro Ulloa who photographed the terror cult movie Horror Express. The motion picture was well directed by Juan Estelrich , and it was success enough . He was a prestigious producer manager and producer who financed various international coproductions in the Sixties and Seventies as Ten Little Indians, Long Live Robin Hood, Justine de Sade, Fumanchu and the kiss of death, Castle of Fumanchu, Seven Secrets of Surmuru, Battle of the Bulge, Tristana, Tamaño Natural and TV series as Desastres de Guerra and Count Montecristo. And working for notorious filmmakers as Luis Buñuel, Luis Garcia Berlanga, Peter Collinson or Jesus Franco.",

Judy Garland gives a great performance as Jean Hansen, a lonely woman on the look out for just the right kind of job.\n\nBurt Lancaster is very convincing as the hospital psychiatrist. He is strict but in many ways kind to the kids. However, the one standout child in this movie is Bruce Ritchey who portrays &quot;Reuben Widdecombe&quot;. The boy dislikes Lancaster for his strictness.\n\nI thought Billy Mumy &quot;Lost In Space&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; would have had a bigger part in this, yet he is only in a supporting role. Bruce Ritchey looks like &quot;the boy next door&quot;, like any other normal kid. Judy Garland takes a great interest in Ritchey and gets his parents to come out to the hospital to see him.\n\nThe dad, Steven Hill, wants to forget that his son ever existed and refuses to come see the boy until the mother, played by Gena Rowlands, tearfully persuades her ex-husband to visit he son. She comes to the hospital herself but refuses to see Reuben.\n\nAll in all, the movie is wonderful. You will definately need to have a box of kleenex nearby. Ritchey will win your heart! I give it an enthusiastic 2 THUMBS UP!"

      "description": "Psychologist Dr. Matthew Clark is the head of the Crawthorne State Training Institute, one of the first boarding schools for developmentally challenged children. Dr. Clark is sympathetic but demanding of his teachers and students. His approach of tough love is controversial. He takes a chance at hiring former aspiring concert pianist Jean Hansen as the school&apos;s music teacher, Miss Hansen who has no background in nursing, teaching or dealing with the developmentally challenged. She herself is trying to find her own place in life. She immediately bonds with autistic student Reuben Widdicombe, who she sees as needing special attention in light of his parents having not visited him since they enrolled him in the school two years earlier. The Widdicombes divorced shortly thereafter because of the pressures their relationship faced in dealing with Reuben. Dr. Clark sees Reuben as the type of child the most difficult with which to deal: Reuben understands just enough to realize that he is different and is often being rejected. Miss Hansen and Dr. Clark disagree on how best to get through to Reuben. Although Dr. Clark admits that his methods have not worked with Reuben, he also does not believe that Miss Hansen&apos;s approach of undivided attention is the answer. Through getting to know the Widdicombe&apos;s reasons for not visiting and she herself seeing the life of the adult disabled, Miss Hansen comes to an understanding of how she feels she can best help her students, Reuben included.",

After ww2, these guys, who were styled to be the pop stars of the third reich, still were quite popular. People didn´t think of them as nazis or war criminals, but as young men with a noble profession: Pilots of the german luftwaffe. The picture has a lot of air fights, a love affair and oldfashioned acting in it. If that is something you like, take a closer look at the video that is still available in germany."

      "reviewBody": "Platform review :\n\nPlatform was one of the first few films signed by Ajay Devgn and that time it was a two hero project with Prithvi also playing a pivotal role. By 1992, Prithvi&apos;s films crashed at the box office while Ajay had two blockbusters - Phool Aur Kaante (1991) and Jigar (1992) - to his credit. That led to change in Platform&apos;s script and the two hero plot became one sided in favour of Ajay Devgn even as Prithvi was relegated to a small role.\n\nPriya Arora (now Tisca Chopra) was cast opposite Devgn and her rain song &apos;Barsaat ka bahaana achcha hai..&apos; is still memorable. &apos;Tha Tha Tha..Duniya ki tha tha tha&apos; is another popular number from the movie.\n\nThe film came in 1993 which was a horrible year for Devgn as almost all his films failed that year. Released at Super Cinema where his Phool Aur Kaante had celebrated a silver jubilee run, Platform couldnt perform to the high expectations people had from it. It worked well in the interiors but still was labelled a flop by trade pundits.\n\nHowever as years passed, Platform gathered its own fan following and used to play regularly in re-runs at most Grant Road cinemas like Alfred and Gulshan. It re-released a couple of times at Super also where it fared better than its initial run.\n\nA high octane actioner and a must watch for Devgn fans. Thats how I will sum up Platform.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

Whether or not he broke character or there were flaws or slips in the film, he had to keep in character any time he was in the public eye. He wasn&apos;t locked away on a set or in a remote location. He wasn&apos;t shielded from scrutiny until every word or action was carefully crafted by editors. He was acting in plan sight, having to flow and improvise anytime he was around the media. These guys are made a film by catching the media off guard, a media hoax, instead of the media paying there rent by displaying or exposing celebrity.\n\nThis is the result of a history of celebrity turning the tables on the media. Edgar Allan Poe used the print media to conduct hoaxes for the end goal of entertainment and enlightenment. He manufactured a truth to raise questions, do you believe everything you read or hear in the case of Orson Wells? I commend the efforts and dedication that went into the making of this movie.\n\nAlso, I wish no one had let me in on the ruse until I had seen the movie. Being fooled is fun, it&apos;s why magicians will always be entertaining despite the fact that we may adamantly dismiss the existence of magic.",

Although some of the acting could be deemed less than extremely pathetic, the directing was not. He has absolutely no idea how to create a suspenseful atmosphere. Granted, the script from Kirk Sever didn&apos;t give him much to work with, but there were still times where it was obvious he didn&apos;t maximize the suspense. I wasn&apos;t scared once. I was however left wondering, &quot;Kirk Sever wants his sister to do what to him...?&quot; It tried to use shock value to create a horror movie, but we&apos;ve seen Saw, Faces of Death, Hostel, etc. You&apos;re gonna have to take it a lot farther than that. Otherwise it&apos;ll just look lame, as it did. Overall it looked like a decent high school project. Nowhere near anything worthy of being on a Blockbuster shelf. If you like horror movies, even if you like bad horror movies, do not watch this. The only way you could justify watching this garbage is if you&apos;re an up and coming horror director/writer and you want to see what not to do.",

This was a no-budget production, but it had a BIG story. The best scene was between Andy the android and Lt. Covel. Trying to explain the sexual side effects of her telepathic enhancing drugs. To be honest, Space Specks reminded me of my favorite Saturday morning shows from the 70s. Such as &quot;Space Academy&quot; and &quot;Jason of Star Command&quot;. In fact, the first time I saw it, it was a Saturday morning. Oh yes, I was enjoying some cereal too. I say this...check this movie out. Good sets, good acting and best of all A GOOD STORY!"

      "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s final film Family Plot is a story of two male and female criminal partnerships. The first pair is Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris who are a pair of small time grifters and we meet them in the process of fleecing a rich old spinster Cathleen Nesbitt with a phony psychic act.\n\nThe second pair are William Devane and Karen Black who have a lovely line in ransom kidnappings. They&apos;ve really got it worked out to a science, including a soundproof hidden room in Devane&apos;s basement where the victims can be stashed until the ransom is paid. \n\nNesbitt confesses that she had her late sister give up an out of wedlock child during a séance and now she&apos;d like to make amends by finding him and making him her heir. So with a finder&apos;s fee in mind Dern and Harris start digging.\n\nTheir paths cross Devane and Black as the police are hunting them so it becomes quite an interesting set of circumstances as Devane and Black suspect the others of being police operatives.\n\nHitchcock cleverly interweaves the stories of the two couples into a very cohesive plot. The players all hit the mark with their roles,] especially Devane, a smooth talking killer in the Hitchcock tradition of Otto Kruger in Saboteur, Tom Helmore in Vertigo, and James Mason in North By Northwest.\n\nThe ending is a bit of a surprise though, it comes rather abruptly. I have to confess I didn&apos;t like it at first, but it does kind of grow on you with repeated viewings.\n\nFamily Plot is a good for the master of suspense to go out on.",

Neil Simon always knows how to combine that perfect blend of realism, a comic touch and something you can identify with into everything he writes and makes you feel so comfortable in his story because you feel you&apos;re in the story. He makes you want to be become a writer. This is what makes Neil Simon unique. If only every movie could be written this well. This is what great Hollywood film-making is all about.",

Cowperthwaite&apos;s reconstructs the narrative leading to the final, and fatal, encounter of Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau, alternating footage, both in the wild and in aquariums, with interviews and contextual data. \n\nFinally, it is a work that, without ever abandoning neutrality, serves a mostly noble cause: that against the confinement of animals that are intelligent, social, and set to crisscross oceans, not to be kept in tanks.\n\nMy hope is that, by being such a fine piece of art, it also helps change the industry of marine-life entertainment theme parks.\n\nSo &quot;Blackfish&quot; is a big splash in more than one way!

      "reviewBody": "I picked this up from the library on a whim but didn&apos;t regret it. The story is obviously still very topical. It just manages to do this without resorting to any stereotypes - in fact, it challenges those very stereotypes. The more the story progresses the more you realise as a viewer that there is no clear right and wrong and you have to keep re-evaluating your own opinion on the characters and the situation they are in. For me this was really a movie that made me think. And although the blurb on the DVD case prepares you for a surprise at the end that doesn&apos;t mean the film is predictable. There are still some twists and turns that come quite unexpected. Of particular note is of course Fishburne&apos;s performance. Worth noting is also that the DVD cover can be deceiving: in Germany it only shows a maimed hand (which reminded me a bit of Saw). But: physical violence is not the focus of this film but rather the tension and verbal struggles between its two main characters. In fact, the film is so dialog-heavy that it&apos;s been compared to a play. With all the generic stuff on terrorism that&apos;s out there this really stood out to me and I highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll be entirely honest straight away and open with the blunt opinion/statement that &quot;Capricorn One&quot; isn&apos;t a very good movie. The script is often poorly written, with abysmal dialogues and unclear sub plots being the most noticeable painful shortcomings. There are also too many overlong and tedious sequences, underdeveloped characters and a downright ridicule climactic battle-sequence featuring an antique and ramshackle crop duster versus two hi-tech governmental helicopters! But guess what? All this doesn&apos;t really matter because &quot;Capricorn One&quot; also has one of THE most shockingly brilliant and uncomfortably disturbing premises of all times! I&apos;ll leave in the middle what came first: writer/director Peter Hyams&apos; ideas for this film or the existing conspiracy theories around the 1969 Apollo moon landing. It&apos;s probably the latter, but fact remains that Hyams was the courageous man who turned the hypothesis into a big Hollywood story AND even managed to engage NASA as a sponsor and technical adviser for a tale that basically banters them.\n\nI tell you, the premise is truly amazing! The moment is finally there after years of preparation and hard work. A not-so-large crowd has gathered to witness the launch of the very first manned US space mission to Mars, but literally seconds before lift-off, the three &quot;hero&quot;-astronauts are instructed to leave their capsule and subsequently get escorted to a secretive desert location. First they receive a long and depressing speech from NASA director James Kelloway, about how the American public - including the President - isn&apos;t interested in expensive space programs anymore and how potential failures aren&apos;t tolerated. The three astronauts (Brubaker, Willis and Walker) silently listen to their superior and immediately understand what is expected from them. They are forced to comply with the simulation of the whole prestigious mission. For months and months, they stay at the hangar where the Martian landscapes and a replica of their rocket Capricorn One have been recreated to fool the TV- networks and their wives. However, pretending to be circling around in outer space is easy, but what&apos;ll happen when the mission is about to come to an end? Meanwhile, a freelance journalist (Elliot Gould) becomes suspicious after a tip from an inside NASA collaborator. \n\n&quot;Capricorn One&quot; is utmost powerful and compelling for as long as it remains a tense (and talkative) conspiracy thriller. Peter Hyams exploits the surreal but simultaneously plausible premise, but his film runs into trouble as soon as story-complexities arise or when the obligatory action/thriller footage has to be delivered. The second half of the film is quite boring, even though that is clearly supposed to be the exciting half, and the whole climax is a weak &amp; desperate attempt to enforce a &quot;happy/truth-will-come-out&quot; ending. \n\nOr  perhaps the ending of &quot;Capricorn One&quot; is dumb and goofy because NASA only wants us to believe that such a large-scaled conspiracy is impossible and unrealistic! After all, yours truly isn&apos;t 100% convinced that the landing on the moon ever take place. Ha :-)",

      "reviewBody": "Shane Meadows is fast becoming one of the finest directors to come out of England, his films have such an earthy quality to them it&apos;s very hard to imagine that any Englishman can not find one film from his output that they can&apos;t identify with. Be it thematically or character wise. Meadows is the man from the street laying out his stories with honesty and gusto awareness. Whether Meadows will ever break out and be a hit outside of the British Isles is highly debatable, his Dead Man&apos;s Shoes from 2004 was well received away from his home shores, but you would be hard pressed to find anyone in American multiplexes (for example purposes only) who could tell you who he is, which for a director who has his finger firmly on the pulse of characterisation, that is a crying shame.\n\nA Room For Romeo Brass is the tale of two teenage boys who during a fight with some bullies meet gangly loner Morell, as Morell starts to take an unhealthy obsession with Romeo&apos;s sister, their friendship is pulled apart, but this is merely the start of Morell&apos;s impact as he is about to explode into both of the boys already fractured families.\n\nThat&apos;s all you need to know really, for there is no more to tell, and this is one of Meadows&apos;s main strengths, there are no hidden agendas, no allegories of wars, this is just an everyday English housing estate with two families awash with everyday characters. Just how often do you see a loner in your neighbourhood? They are there, are they all like Morell? Well it may be best not to find out eh?\n\nPaddy Considine makes his film debut here (thankfully he is now a name across the waters), and his turn as Morell is as scary as it is sad. Anyone who was impressed with his turn as the vengeful Richard in Dead Man&apos;s Shoes will be well rewarded here. A young Andrew Shim as Romeo grabs the role with sizzling vitality, a character calling for strength of nature whilst layering in a heartfelt slant that the story benefits from. I must mention big Frankie Harper (Dog in Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels), playing Romeo&apos;s estranged father, he gets it absolutely note perfect and I was delighted to see Meadows give him the film&apos;s crowning moment.\n\nA film that opens with The Specials and closes with The Stone Roses should always appeal to an English heart, but lets get Shane Meadows&apos; work out there to the masses, for here is a man who even gives an end credit mention for the man who turned on the generators, a man making films for the people, about the people in our midsts. 8/10",

No wonder why the movie was a good one. \n\nThis is not the typical guy meets girl romance which was nice. We have some mystery and a bit of a surprise ending that I originally thought might occur, but then dismissed it. So I was surprised. The two female leads were very good and there really wasn&apos;t any dull spots in the movie. The boy was great. \n\nSome of the reviews say the film takes place in Wilsonville, Vermont when there is no such town. There is a Wilsonville, Oregon with a population of the same as shown in the sign shown in the movie (which probably isn&apos;t an actual sign). The mom is played by the same actress who played the mother Mrs Thatcher on &quot;When calls the Heart&quot;.",

Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some Vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. Actually nothing happens. It is like Hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. And this gets so boring after a while. I even didn&apos;t watch the whole thing the second time, for I fell vast asleep. That is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it!\n\nBack then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10",

It has it&apos;s moments of action and thrills - mainly from Jason Scott Lee - but the story is lagging a bit in my opinion. I would not watch this movie with expectations of it being a bad or a good film... instead watch it with no expectations and you may be surprised. \n\n5/10",

The subject is unique: I don&apos;t think anyone else has ever written a book by blinking an eyelid, and Bauby&apos;s story is remarkable. And it is fitting that a famous and good director like Beineix set out to chronicle Bauby&apos;s last weeks on earth. He takes full advantage of the atmosphere inside and outside the hospital to generate a quite surprising level of intensity. I found the film profoundly moving, and many of the students I showed it to were affected too.\n\nIt would be great if it was made more available, but when or how that will happen, I don&apos;t know.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw &quot;When the Light Comes&quot; on television late night movies six years ago. Due to the usual timing problems associated with the late night presentation, the ending was cut off. I waited unsuccessfully since then for this film to reappear. Apparently, it&apos;s only available on DVD as a PAL European version so I had to wait until I found a Region-free DVD player so I could see the whole movie.\n\nI&apos;m glad I did because the ambiguous ending minimizes the film&apos;s other imperfections. Do the ending scenes with Ellen and Lars playing snow golf show that Ellen did return to Spitzbergen to live with Lars? Did Ellen return to Robert and are the ending scenes just Ellen&apos;s happy memories? The book might provide a clue but it&apos;s never been translated to English so North Americans who don&apos;t speak Dutch are left to ponder the ambiguous ending. Maybe people from the Netherlands are also out of luck as I can&apos;t locate a Dutch version either.\n\nThe European version DVD doesn&apos;t come with English subtitles, just in Dutch or German. That&apos;s a small impediment because most of the film&apos;s dialogue is in English. In my case, I could remember the Dutch dialogue from the English subtitles in the TV version. It consists mostly of Ellen&apos;s feelings in letters to Robert, which you can sense from the action and the English portions, boring stuff for a guy. As a bonus, the European version includes the story how the movie was made. This is mostly in the Dutch language but many scenes are in English because not all the crew and actors spoke Dutch.\n\nSome reviews of the movie commented on Francesca&apos;s lack of experience when this movie was made. I think it worked in this movie as it could be a part of Ellen&apos;s initial awkwardness at the strange situation of a young woman being cooped up for months with an older man. Joachim Król is an experienced actor. I don&apos;t know how he was able to speak English with a Norwegian accent when he sounds quite German in real life. Check out his accent in English in the Special Features.\n\nThis is not a classic movie but it is much better than average. It&apos;s well worth the effort of finding a copy.",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say that &quot;Maniac&quot; isn&apos;t an interesting movie.  It presents itself as an &quot;exploration of the mind of a madman&quot; in much the same way that the 1934 &quot;Maniac&quot; did and with about as much candor (which is to say none at all). &quot;Maniac&quot; is undeniably a classic of its type: an early-80&apos;s slasher/splatter movie stripped down to its absolute essence. It&apos;s probably the purest, the cruellest and the most corrupt example of the genre ever to exist on film. In fact, it exaggerates the cliches and easy criticisms of the genre to such an outrageous extent that it often seems more like a straw-man set up to deconstruct the mechanics of slasher movies than an example of the real thing.  But don&apos;t be fooled.  Although &quot;Maniac&quot; pretends to assume a sort of artistic gravity and a seriousness of intent, it&apos;s a Hershell Gordon Lewis movie at heart.\n\nThe film itself consists of almost nothing more than a prolonged series of suspense-building set-ups, each of which climaxes in a beautifully executed and lovingly presented piece of state-of-the-art special makeup gore.  The special effects makeup, by George Romero regular Tom Savini, is truly spectacular.  A scalping presented early in the film and a shotgun blast to the head presented later are especially memorable.  Tom is even allowed a small part in the film, which culminates in probably the finest &quot;exploding-head&quot; effect ever presented on film (for the special makeup fan, it is truly gratifying to see this master craftsman allowed to &quot;execute&quot; himself in such a fitting manner).  More than anything else, it is the gore which has earned the film what little fame (or infamy) it can be said to possess.\n\nAll that said, Maniac remains an extremely troubling film.  Many of the comments posted here mention its &quot;cheapness&quot;, a description based largely, I suspect, on the poor treatment the film has usually received in it&apos;s home video presentations.  But as made abundantly clear in its recent repackaging as a remastered, widescreen, &quot;director&apos;s cut&quot; fan item, Maniac is anfairly well-crafted film.  Its pacing is deliberately austere, and it very effectively generates an atmosphere of grimy, claustrophobic tension.  In its technical finesse and industrial chill, &quot;Maniac&quot; resembles a George Romero movie made by Brian DePalma.  Each shot appears to have been carefully framed, and the cinematography is generally fine, occasionally even excellent.  In many respects it&apos;s an accomplished piece of filmmaking, especially when measured against slasher/splatter exploitation movies as a genre.  The harsh and grating soundtrack, which borrows heavily from the John Carpenter school of minimal synth arpeggios, is probably the film&apos;s weakest point technically, but only if you ignore the acting.\n\nIn the title role, writer/star Joe Spinell turns in an amazingly overblown and dull-witted depiction of a man at war with his own demons.  (Don&apos;t get your hopes up, though.  It&apos;s not even good for camp laffs.)  The character wobbles back and forth between raving, drooling monsterhood, and everyday-joe-ness without justifying the transitions or making either state really credible.  Many writers seem to argue for the validity of the central performance, and, measured against films like &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Maniac&quot; may seem like a reasonable and nuanced portrait of mental instability.  In any broader context, however, the performance is absolutely atrocious. Furthermore, the script insists that we accept the villain as a professional artist, rather than the janitor or plumber he in every resembles.  The supporting parts are equally underdeveloped and wooden, drawing clear attention to the fact that character development is not of much interest to the filmmakers.\n\nJoe&apos;s performance would be bad enough if the filmmakers didn&apos;t insist on placing him in the middle of almost every single shot.  &quot;Maniac&quot; never strays outside the killer&apos;s view.  There is no pursuit, no detection, no &quot;good guys&quot; at all.  We (the audience) know the victims only as the killer knows them.  They exist only as fodder for their own exquisitely rendered death scenes.  Which gives the movie a certain purity and simplicity, but exacerbates a repulsive sort of audience dynamic.  The killer is the only real identification point in the movie.  We see much of the action in straight point-of-view.  Which could be said to draw attention to the viewer&apos;s complicity with the spectacle, but this is clearly not the filmmaker&apos;s intent.  Instead we are forced to INDENTIFY with the killer. We wait on the edge of our seats for the explosions of blood and agony just as he does.\n\nFundamentally, &quot;Maniac&quot; isn&apos;t really interested in much besides the depiction of violence and pain.  Violence and pain appear not as mechanisms by which the audience can be manipulated, but as simple ends in themselves. &quot;Maniac&quot; is the purest expression of the dominant 80&apos;s &quot;violence as pornography&quot; horror film aesthetic.  It delivers extremely strong levels of brutal violence early, to set up audience expectations, and continues to bring the gore throughout its running time.  Its very capably handled suspense sequences are based not on the classic &quot;will the bad thing happen?&quot; tension, but on a more modern &quot;how will the bad thing be presented?&quot; tension.  And that&apos;s all well and good.  Grand guignol is a big part of the function of the contemporary horror film.  As an audience, we know what&apos;s gonna happen, we just agonize over (and at the same time anticipate) the precise congruence of knife and girl that will finish the scene.  What makes &quot;Maniac&quot; so dispicable is the black haze of cruelty and lust that rises off the whole thing.  The film&apos;s basic misogyny and frustrated desire are so fundamental to its nature that it seems almost pointless to mention or criticize them.\n\nIt&apos;s this pitiless, leering quality that makes the movie so uncomfortable to watch or enjoy in any traditional sense.  With many Italian Zombie/Cannibal films of the same era (most notably Ruggereo Deodato&apos;s &quot;The House at the Edge of the Park&quot; and &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;) it shares a quality of prurient moralism that is extremely queasy at heart.  The film seems to glower down on the atrocities it presents with a sort of cold puritanism, but ultimately cannot conceal the glee and fetishized sexuality in it&apos;s gaze.  What&apos;s more, it seems totally unaware that such issues might even be considered (unlike &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; which exploits issues of viewer culpability for cheap effect).*  &quot;Maniac&quot; is an extremely self-conscious movie that remains, somehow, utterly unaware of its own psychodynamics.  An ugly, witless and nearly inhuman piece of work.\n\n* For reference, see &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot;, which exploits viewer culpability to great effect.\n\n *** caveat ***\n\n I admit that these criticisms will seem tediously familiar to anyone who has followed the progress of the horror film over the past thirty years. These are not new arguments and perhaps not interesting ones.  Please keep in mind, though, that this review was written by someone who LOVES horror movies and gore flicks, but who f***ing loathes slasher movies and the depiction of suffering for &quot;entertainment&apos;s&quot; sake.  Most horror fans probably wouldn&apos;t find &quot;Maniac&quot; as distasteful as I did.   I&apos;m not arguing that movies make people kill.  I don&apos;t hate horror movies.  I don&apos;t hate gore.  I just hate this movie."

      "reviewBody": "This could hardly be ranked as a classic of French cinema but director Yves Ciampi has the services of master cinematographer Henri Alekan and top notch leading players.\n\nSurly Yves Montand falls for sultry Maria Felix and who could blame him!\n\nHe agrees to sell stolen diamonds to the ever-so-charming Curt Jurgens but their scheme is scuppered by crackpot Jean Servais who is obsessed with Maria......\n\nHerr Jurgen&apos;s performance won him a Volpi Cup, for which he tied with Kenneth More. Also featured is Gert Frobe who, like Jurgens, was to have the distinction, if one can call it that, of playing a Bond villain. The film really belongs to Servais whose manic performance is mesmerising. Five years later, in Bunuel&apos;s &apos;Fever mounts in El Pao&apos;, he was again to lust after La Dona Maria. This is one of three French films that this fascinating female made at about this time, the best of which is indisputably Renoir&apos;s &apos;French Can-Can&apos;.\n\nWhat can one possibly say about Monsieur Montand? His early experiences in front of the camera were not entirely happy but with maturity he became one of France&apos;s finest. His performance as Mario in Clouzot&apos;s &apos;Wages of Fear&apos; made him an obvious choice here.\n\nSuffice to say Yves Ciampi is not in the same league as the three directors mentioned above but he does his best with the material at his disposal and the film gradually builds in tension and momentum, climaxing in an exciting scene in a swamp(where else!)\n\nThe final shot of Montand and Jurgens emerging from the swamp to the accompaniment of Beethoven&apos;s Fifth is inspired and obviously designed to reflect Franco-German rapprochement.",

They&apos;re obviously insane.&apos; \tWith this dialogue the tension begins to mount in Director Philippe Setton&apos;s thriller. Writers&apos; Derry Hall and Brad Lynch have created a perfect showcase for the quirky acting talents of lead, Jeff Goldblum. \tGoldblum&apos;s character is arrested at the beginning of the movie for the savage torture/murder of 24 people. We become aware of these murders as we see the investigators \twatching the tapes he made. Their reactions intensify the impact more than actually viewing it our self would have. \tFrost is immediately incarcerated in a psychiatric institute where he begins to make the claim he is actually the Devil and his mission on earth is to cause people to regain their belief (faith if you will) in him. Strange things begin to happen shortly after his arrival, which cause Dr. Sarah Day, played by Kathy Baker, to consider his claim.\t \tThe movie leaves it to the viewer to decide if Frost is really causing things to happen using Demonic powers or just `brilliantly&apos; insane and everyone, including the hospital staff, is falling prey to his psychosis. It is a well-directed and written story with a standout performance coming from Goldblum. He instills in his character a certain evil slyness, which will cause you to glance quickly behind you when Mr. Frost lays his eye on you."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The love of our private friends is the only preparatory exercise for the love of all men.&quot; John Henry Cardinal Newman\n\nLast Vegas is promoted by some as a geriatric Hangover; it&apos;s not quite. It&apos;s rather a sometimes poignant if lighthearted comedy about friendship and love with a dash of philosophizing about growing old. Three sixty- something buddies have a bachelor party in Las Vegas for their equally aging buddy who is marrying a babe over half his age.\n\nThe usual bachelor party tropes are there: swimming pools, buxom girls, extravagant digs, gambling, drunken partying, and pappy love, among others. But lacing through this usually freewheeling, adolescent humored romp of a cliché are some thoughts about their 60 years of friendship and what it brings and demands.\n\nMost importantly is the rivalry between Billy (Michael Douglas) and Paddy (Robert De Niro) over the girl who got away from Billy and married Paddy. How her death affects their friendship is touching if not overly sentimental but real as it continues to color their lives to this day. How it shapes the weekend and Billy&apos;s marriage takes the film beyond Hangover and Bridesmaids.\n\nAbsent are scatological humor or retching; those staples of current buddy comedies are not in the least missed. Each other friend has his issue as well: Sam (Kevin Kline) his true love for his wife, who gives him Viagra and a condom for the trip; and Archie (Morgan Freeman) his over solicitous son. Director John Turteltaub and writer Dan Fogelman treat the hang-ups with gentleness, never extending to slapstick the important challenge of each life brought into relief by the trip.\n\nLast Vegas is a diverting enjoyment, most of which is watching highly successful actors as if they&apos;ve worked together forever, when in fact they never did. Movie magic and friendship themes make this a comfort film among too much glitz on other screens."

Not because I want them to be sad or because I think they could learn anything new but because I think everyone should want to see the best of everything and this film is the best of its genre that I have ever seen. The acting is perfect. The metaphors are delicious and the hidden signs are just waiting to be uncovered. \n\nAnother great thing about this movie is that it is interesting to get different perspectives from your friends as to what they think happened in the movie and to whose side they are on. It is unlikely that they will have trouble connecting to or relating to the characters in Blue Valentine no matter if they have ever been married or had kids before. \n\nDon&apos;t expect this to be a date movie or a nice happy rom-com. It is pretty much the anti-thesis of a date movie."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;What&apos;s Love Got to Do With It&quot; is a fascinating and absorbing portrayal of the first 43 years of Tina Turner&apos;s life.  It accurately and convincingly depicts the abuse she underwent and her escape and, finally, salvation through Buddhism.  Laurence Fishburne is one of this generation great actors and gives a riveting and observant performance as Ike Turner, but cannot come close to the overwhelming, breathtaking, and mighty presence of Angela Bassett as Tina.  She deservedly won the Golden Globe as the Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical of 1993 and if the film had come out any other year than 1993 (during which Holly Hunter gave a performance of a lifetime in &quot;The Piano&quot;), she would have easily taken home an Oscar.\n\nMusic plays a huge part in the film and all of it is good.  Though I&apos;m only 12, I truly appreciate Tina&apos;s music and am always in awe when she sings &quot;Proud Mary&quot; (one of my favorite scenes in the film.)  As Roger Ebert pointed out, one of the most triumphant scenes is where, after Tina and Ike have had a vicious and bloody fight, Tina runs away to the Ramada Inn where they take her in.  It is one of the best acted scenes of this decade and I never tire of it when I see the film again.\n\n&quot;What&apos;s Love Got to Do With It&quot; is one of the best films of 1993 (one of the greatest movie years in history- &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot;, &quot;The Piano&quot;) and one the most passionately and skillfully performed films of the decade.\n\n**** out of **** (A)"

      "reviewBody": "This is a silly movie that&apos;s also funny. With all the crap out there, why did it set a record for lowest opening day box office for a movie in 3,000 theaters? Perhaps it was simply not appropriately advertised. I see other reviewers using words like &apos;for teen girls&apos; and for &apos;pre-teens.&apos; I don&apos;t believe that those demographics were the actual target for this movie. A silly comedy with attractive teen girls starring in it also appeals to boys (although they might not be completely honest about it) and 17 is middle-aged teen, not pre-teen. Also, while there is no bad language in the movie that I noticed, there were definitely situations of a suggestive nature that I would not recommend for &quot;pre-teens.&quot; I can&apos;t believe their other movies had this level of &apos;sophistication.&apos; If you make a movie for older teens and young adults and movie-goers get the idea it&apos;s made for pre-teens, perhaps that is part of the disconnect that explains the box office failure.\n\nMy wife and I have no children, but really laughed out loud at parts of the movie, especially &quot;the speech.&quot; I&apos;m not saying who said what so this is not a spoiler. We have not seen other Olsen Twins movies, other than about 2 minutes in a Costco that had a special on their videos. Personally, I thought the girls were fine and the other stars solid. In fact, for my money, the worst actor in the movie by far was Jack Osbourne; not bad, just the least polished of the bunch. And yes, I have seen him in Ozzie Osbourne&apos;s family&apos;s reality show.\n\nThe bloopers, billed as &quot;Hilarous Bloopers&quot; were in fact pretty funny, especially watching the twins&apos; reaction to each other&apos;s issues. Certainly, it might have helped to show those in the theater. As it happened, we rented the movie while on vacation. If you&apos;re looking for a change of pace from SciFi and Bourne-esqe thriller movies, you could do a lot worse.",

      "reviewBody": "FOOTNOTE is an appropriately titled sparklingly intelligent and entertaining film written and directed by Joseph Cedar. With a small cast and a focused story this little film form Israel is not only a pleasure to watch as a story performed as shared by brilliant actors, but it is also one of the most visually artistic and creative venture of cinematography to be on the small screen in a long time: the genius cinematographer is Yaron Scharf. Add to this a musical score that enhances every moment of the story - courtesy of composer Amit Poznansky - and the film simply succeeds on every level.\n\nIn a most ingenious way we are introduced to the two main characters - father and son, both professors in the Talmud department of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The film opens on the confused and somewhat unattached facial expression of the seated father Eliezer Shkolnik (Shlomo Bar Aba) as he listens to his ebullient son Uriel Shkolnik (Lior Ashkenazi) being inducted into the prestigious Israeli academic union. Uriel&apos;s acceptance speech reflects his childhood when his father informed him upon questioning that he was a &apos;teacher&apos; - an occupation the young Uriel found embarrassing at the time, but now honors his father for this guidance. After the ceremony we slowly discover that there is a long-standing rivalry between father and son. Uriel has an addictive dependency on the embrace and accolades that the establishment provides, while Eliezer is a stubborn purist with a fear and profound revulsion for what the establishment stands for, yet beneath his contempt lies a desperate thirst for some kind of recognition: his only clam to fame after long years of intensive research is that the man who published his findings mentions Eliezer in a footnote. When it comes times for the Israel Prize, Israel&apos;s most prestigious national award, to be awarded, a clerical error results in a telephone call informing Eliezer that he has won, while in reality the award was meant for his son Uriel. How this error is resolved open all manner of windows for examining family relationships, fame, pure academia, and forgiveness.\n\nThe film is an unqualified success. Lior Ashkenazi (so well remembered from &apos;Walk on Water&apos; and &apos;Late Marriage&apos; among others) gives a bravura performance and that of Shlomo Ben Aba balances it in quality. The supporting cast is strong. Joseph Cedar has produced a fine film very much enhanced by the brilliance of the cinematography that tells the story as much as the dialogue. \n\nGrady Harp",

It amazes me that so many people are quick to put the boot in to this (admittedly) silly but entertaining b-grade post-apocalyptic thriller yet line up to watch the absolutely awful and overblown Star Wars movies. Yes, I said b-grade, because despite the budget being close to $100 million, that&apos;s exactly what it is, a b-grade sci fi movie, no more, no less. Fans of Roy Ward Baker&apos;s &apos;Quatermass and the Pit&apos;, Larry Cohen&apos;s &apos;Q: The Winged Serpent&apos; and Tobe Hooper&apos;s &apos;Lifeforce&apos;, all of which &apos;Reign Of Fire&apos; reminded me of at various points, will enjoy this one more than the Blockbuster crowd. Christian Bale (&apos;American Psycho&apos;) and Matthew McConaughey (&apos;Frailty&apos;) are both pretty good as the leader of an underground community and a hardass military man respectively, who both have different approaches to their shared problem - the ongoing threat of dragon attacks. Yes, in this future dragons are real and have devastated the world, and only a handful of human survivors exist. Once you can accept that premise, and some of the &quot;scientific&quot; explanations for the why and wherefores of the dragons, you&apos;re in for a wild ride. No-one&apos;s gonna argue this is a great movie, but it&apos;s a lot of fun, and I recommend it, especially with beer and pizza."

      "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang&apos;s Das TESTAMENT des Dr.MABUSE is a mesmerising, master-crafted entertainment which no serious movie freak will have missed. The largely forgotten, parallel French version, filmed simultaneously with a French speaking cast, is like most of these foreign versions, a poor relation. I&apos;m glad I saw the German one first - twice in a week as it happens. \n\nShorter than the German film, it truncates the lovers subplot and plays it with colourless juveniles, omits the giant eye make up shots of Klein Rogge, which re-call Dr. Baum&apos;s art collection and, worse, attempts to up the pace by chopping off the fade out scene transitions - giving correctly, the impression that there is something missing.\n\nThe German cast is uniformly superior, with the possible exception of the jolly, frankfurter-cooking henchman, who does manage to make an impression. Jim Gerald was a comedian - effectively so in CHAPEAU de PAILEE d&apos;ITALIE and FRENCH WITHOUT TEARS - and he lacks the monolith menace that Wernike provides. Thommy Bordelle is normally an unimposing performer and, giving it his best shot, he&apos;s still no fair swap for the the great Oscar Beregei, in the one circulating film where we get to hear Beregei&apos;s voice. The French Dr. Kramm (who is he?), in particular, is out classed by Theodore Loos (the secretary from METROPOLIS among other stand-out performances).\n\nWell it&apos;s still Lang&apos;s Mabuse film and remains intermittently effective - Hoffmeister&apos;s vision of Lohman&apos;s entry into his see through cell is still a grabber - and it is another piece of the jig saw and another, if minor, Lang movie. So nice to get to see it after all these years."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s amazing just how many visual sex metaphors director Jirí Menzel managed to cram into 92 minutes, without ever becoming ridiculous or losing the plot. It makes Hitchcock&apos;s train going into the tunnel shot from &apos;North By Northwest&apos; look like the work of a rank amateur.\n\nOstensibly &apos;Closely Watched Trains&apos; is the story of Trainee Milos Hrma (Václav Neckár) starting his job at the local train station during the Nazi occupation of what was then Czechoslovakia (only I guess it wasn&apos;t, because it was officially absorbed by the Reich). Throughout most of the film the war, complete with what the local Nazi functionary describes as &quot;beautiful tactical withdrawals,&quot; is a long way off and Milos has more important matters to attend to. Specifically he&apos;s trying to lose his virginity and deal with another problem common to young men everywhere, one which the local doctor advises him to solve by thinking about football during critical moments.\n\nMade in 1966, when some Czechs were clearly already looking ahead to 1968&apos;s Prague Spring, the film slyly uses the Nazis as a stand-in for the Soviets. As proof of this, and the Hollywood establishment&apos;s anti-Communist bent in the late 60s, &apos;Closely Watched Trains&apos; won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. It is, however, imminently deserving of the win on its own merits.\n\nHistory lessons aside &apos;Closely Watched Trains&apos; is beautifully shot, well acted, and absurdly hilarious, while still tasting of tragedy. Excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "Between 1963 and 1988 there were approximately 605 movies made in Europe that qualify as &quot;Spaghetti Westerns&quot;, and 604 of them feature scenes filmed in a particular, distinctive valley in Spain (Yugoslavia?) that was the site of a miraculous avalanche or other kind of geologic event untold thousands of years ago. Someday I hope to find that one Spaghetti Western adventure that does not have a single shootout, hell bent for leather pursuit, ambush by hidden Federales troops or Fernando Sancho grilling fresh range turkey over an open fire amidst the distinctive looking spew of white, granite like rocks. Just one.\n\nThis geologic feature is to Spaghetti Westerns what Monument Valley is to John Ford, the backlot of Universal is for STAR TREK, or the woods surrounding a summer camp to Jason Vorhees. It&apos;s a stomping ground, and one that is re-defined in literally hundreds of movies to be different places that were thousands of miles away from where they were filming. Sartana, Django, Shango, Durango, Ringo, and whoever Richard Harrison was (Joko?) all did their time in these rocks. They are as memorable and real as that giant boulder Captain Kirk fought the Gorn on top of. \n\nI mention the geology because the excellent Koch DVD release of this well made but literally obscure Euro Western by Alfonse Brescia only has German and Italian language options, so I&apos;m sort of following along as best one can without knowing what the hell is going on. There are a lot of dramatic discussions, furious riding scenes and so far two shootouts set amongst the rocks, which also turned up this evening in two movies that both starred Anthony Steffen and Eduardo Fajardo, who must have known their way around those rocks blindfolded. Those guys were pro&apos;s, and acting amongst these rocks must have been like playing in Yankee Stadium for them.\n\nThis one stars Peter Lee Lawrence, the baby faced gunfighter, and like many of the examples of the form I am drawn to represents a transitional effort between a straightforward Cowboy Movie and what became known as the Spaghetti Western. Spaghetti is often defined by it&apos;s preoccupation with style over substance, and while it&apos;s pretty easy to figure out what&apos;s going on here there is a lot more substance than style. If people weren&apos;t talking Italian this could be an episode of Gunsmoke without much work: even Bruno Nicolai sounds like he sort of took it easy on this one, producing a musical score that flavors the movie without really defining it in the usual way one expects. The most startling thing about the film was Rosalba Neri who has her clothes torn from her during an early scene -- anyone who isn&apos;t startled by the sight of Rosalba Neri&apos;s upper torso freed from the constraints of opaque clothing needs to start snorting meth.\n\nBut then it&apos;s back to those rocks: Mr. Brescia must have had a specific fascination for them, or maybe there is some interesting story behind why half of this movie consists of panoramic scenes of those damn rocks shot from seventeen different angles to try and make them look like different places. Perhaps it&apos;s as easy as they were available to be filmed around without requiring any costly construction or lighting or rent. After all, they are just rocks out in some valley. Set up your camera &amp; start filming, who&apos;s to know.\n\nMind you I&apos;m not complaining, just pointing it out, and indeed having your Spaghetti Western set amongst that marvelous hillside is sort of a certificate of authenticity. Being able to see them with different actors scrabbling around for cover is why we watch the damn things. Brescia is only acknowledging his form, not cowering behind an artifice of reality that might mask the fact that this is just another one of 604 movies that ultimately will all look, sound, and turn out more or less the same, and I find the effect to be somewhat comforting -- Oceans may rise and kingdoms may fall, but if anybody has to ride for their lives in an Italian made Western from the 1960s the chances are pretty good that they will end up on that road which twists between the hills of this rock strewn valley, wherever it really is. And there they go again now.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Camp 14: Total Control Zone documents the harrowing details of &apos;life&apos; in North Korea&apos;s forced labour camps from 3 perspectives, a former inmate born within one of the camps who managed to escape, a former guard, and a former member of the secret police.\n\nI do not want to give the story away for those who have yet to see it, but what these stories reveal is a world where a level of cruelty and disregard for human life exists that struggles to be dreamt up in infamous works of fiction by Pasolini or de Sade (some details a chilling reminder of scenes from 1975&apos;s &apos;Salo&apos;).\n\nThe police and guards, who are the purveyors of this cruelty (and there must be a lot of them given the claimed 200,000 interned) can&apos;t all statistically be psychopaths. Operating under a ruthless system, they&apos;d doubtlessly be users of the Nuremberg Defence.\n\nWe read about the actions of the psychopath serial killer, which are a conundrum in themselves, but when this sort of behaviour manifests itself across a whole society, it becomes ... well, I can&apos;t find the right word.\n\nWhat sort of fear and desperation would lead to a society being created based on force feeding the populace lies and leader worship, ignorance replacing civic dialogue, with forced labour, torture and death being the only solution to needing a justice system (and for that matter, unemployment)? \n\nOnly through a miraculous if not morbid event does the protagonist (Shin Dong-Hyuk) manage to escape the camp, and we are thankful he does, in order to experience freedom and provide the rest of the world with a brief but revealing peek into the horror show.\n\nSome of his revelations will prompt the viewer question the nature of human instincts. Seemingly we are born with no emotional attachment to our family or fellow human beings, only the will to survive appears to be firmly ingrained in us.\n\nAs Camp 14 draws to a close, we get a sense of ennui and confusion from Shin at his new surroundings. He appears far from joyful at having left the life he was born into, inexplicable to the rest of us, as inexplicable and impenetrable as the conditions in which he was born into.",

The only problem i have with it is that some of it seemed &quot;unreal&quot; especially the end scene (I wont say what it is, cos it will ruin the film).\n\nNot bad, not great. ***  out of *****"

      "reviewBody": "This movie has to be one of the best thrillers of the 70&apos;s and it still packs a punch today. The reason is simple, you think you know the whole story then suddenly the plot twists leaving you all shaken up. The script by Salim Javed was absolutely superb. Amitabh excelled in a role he was born to play. Zeenat Aman provided good support as his love interest. Even Pran lent fantastic support.This film isn&apos;t the greatest to ever hit Bollywood, nor it is a path breaking film for the industry. Don is a genuine entertainer with an interesting story line for the 70&quot;s era. They could have spent half the film showing the notorious don but instead the character dies soon, and later is replaced by a look-a-like. Which is where we get plenty of laughter and light moments. Towards the end when he is discovered by the police to be a fake Don, he is in a big soup. It is interesting how he manages to prove himself innocent, and how he find the father of the kids he was taking care of. mega hit songs by Kishore Kumar &amp; Asha Bhosle with the powerful music done by Kalyanji Anandji :) one of the best movie I have ever seen in the vintage era 70&apos;s with greatest night view camera work used in this mega hit film Don :)",

Since I had seen a number of Robert Redford&apos;s (who turns 71 today) movies during the past year and had thus taken an interest in his work, I decided to watch the movie.\n\nI have to say that it really impressed me. I don&apos;t know whether to describe it as mystifying, ethereal, or something else. I could go forever in trying to praise it, though I don&apos;t consider it the greatest movie ever. But I definitely extend the recommendation that the teacher gave the class.\n\nStarring Ruben Blades, Daniel Stern, Melanie Griffith, John Heard and Chick Venera.",

      "name": "Cassavetes the Tough-Guy",
      "reviewBody": "As another film in a long-line for Cassavetes, much like Orson Welles did for many years, done more-so to pay the bills for the next feature film as director than for any kind of real &apos;passion&apos; for the project, Machine-Gun McCain acts, walks and talks like a gangster genre picture. And from Italy no less.\n\nIt has a similar kind of beat to it like Point Blank where you have a real tough guy gangster (Cassavetes) who is out of jail and has some payback to deliver to a super-criminal organization and based more on principle than anything else. He decides to pull a rather crazy casino-heist job, but not with the same kind of crew or expertise that Ocean&apos;s Eleven might&apos;ve had. No, instead, when not laying his hot Euro-girl (Britt Eklund), he&apos;s preparing by himself to bomb the s**t out of the casino and make off with the cake in a rather twisted premise.\n\nGiuliano Montaldo&apos;s film is spare on character exploration - this is not the kind of film that Cassavetes would make himself, not in a thousand years - but is good on making things &apos;cool&apos; in the heist-movie sense. The little we know about Hank McCain is just enough to keep the story going.\n\nThere is some supporting character stuff with Peter Falk&apos;s gangster who is in some heat over some bad business going on behind the scenes (lots of tense shouting going on in some of these scenes, it looks fun to play but who knows on the freewheeling Italian productions), and absolutely nothing really to Eklund&apos;s character. I wondered throughout the film why she would go on with all of this what Hank was doing. Who is she and what is he to her? I guess who cares ultimately except as someone to carry the explosives and drive the car in a clinch.\n\nMore interesting in the film, though sadly underused, is a character Gena Rowlands plays (both Falk and Rowlands being Cassvetes regular players) who was an old flame of Hank McCain&apos;s way back when, and Rowlands gives this character a lot of unexpected depth in just five minutes of screen-time.\n\nShe shows up since Hank needs some help in the last act of the story, and their chemistry on screen (notwithstanding being real life husband and wife) is electrifying, and she has a dangerous quality that speaks of being a femme fatale but a really good egg to the right people. A scene right after this when she&apos;s being questioned by some hoodlums on the trail of McCain is perhaps the best scene of the movie; how much of this was some decent direction or just Rowlands way about the scene I don&apos;t know.\n\nCassavetes, too, thankfully, helps anchor the film when it could get into a lull. He has some kind of concentration about him, whether he&apos;s scoping a joint out or gambling at a casino table or if he&apos;s talking with a few lunkhead lowlife criminals who are plotting a caper that they want to include him on, that makes Machine Gun McCain so enjoyable.\n\nThe story itself is just okay, it moves along at a decent enough pace, but it&apos;s mostly just an excuse for the action to take shape - which, admittedly, once you see what McCain has in store in this heist, it&apos;s really one of the more incredible and daring scenes in heist movies from the time. But with the star there, it&apos;s an odd but compelling presence that makes the film itself much tougher. There&apos;s one scene especially where McCain pulls out his machine fun (hence the name), and it&apos;s a scene of dark, intense power, mostly from him saying little at all.",

Spartacus had a lot of influence on Ridley Scoot&apos;s Gladiator, from way of acting (especially the similarity between Joaquin Pheonix and Laurence Olivier&apos;s character) to the way camera moves and shots are taken. This is truely a great historical film and a classic you should see. It will be hard for me to rank it amongst other Kubrick&apos;s films but I will try it (don&apos;t get angry if you disagree).",

      "reviewBody": "What would make a young man who has just completed a harrowing and brutal six month tour of duty in Afghanistan decide to return for another stint? The answer to that question is puzzling, but it is made a bit clearer by Janus Metz&apos; powerful documentary Armadillo, Gran Prix winner at the Critics Week competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Armadillo, like Restrepo, is named for the military base where the subjects are stationed. The film depicts the bravery and camaraderie and also the addictive high of several Danish soldiers, seemingly just out of their teens, that comes from their participation in the war in Afghanistan.\n\nEdited by Per K. Kirkegaard, Metz follows the soldiers from their farewell party at home filled with naked strippers to their arrival at base camp, moments of relaxation, briefings by their superiors, times of boredom, and the combat that includes some stomach turning sequences. The camera seems to be ever present and it hardly seems like an understatement to say that the director and cinematographer Lars Skee&apos;s lives were as much at risk as the soldiers. The film also demonstrates the plight of the villagers who are afraid of Taliban retribution if they cooperate with coalition forces. Caught in the middle, the Afghan civilians suffer greatly, standing to lose their crops, their animals, and their lives either from NATO forces or from the Taliban.\n\nWhat makes it even more distressing, as the film points out, the soldiers cannot distinguish between friend and foe. When one of the soldiers accidentally kills a young girl, all that can be offered is compensation while the Platoon commander tells the soldier that did the killing to shrug it off because these things happen every day. The camera-work is up close and personal and the horrors of war perhaps have never had such an immediate impact. We can see the look on a young soldier&apos;s face after he has just been shot and we see decapitated Taliban bodies being pulled from a ditch.\n\nWhile the film takes no position either pro-war or anti-war, the inhumanity of war has never been shown more clearly and the soldiers boasting and laughter after obliterating a wounded enemy while high on adrenaline, caused considerable debate about appropriate military behavior back home in Denmark. Depending on your point of view the soldiers are either making a difference or perpetuating atrocities in an unwinnable war. What does become clear, however, is the bond formed by the men and their lack of questioning of their mission. Like adolescents on a drunken rampage, they are excited by the thrill of the moment. We owe Metz a debt of gratitude for showing us the mindless, sadistic, and dehumanizing behavior that war can induce. Armadillo stands as one of the most visceral and frightening documentaries about combat ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "From the opening credits you get your first clue that this spaghetti western is going to be much different that what you typically get. The Mario Migliardi score is subdued, sounding quieter and playing at a much slower pace than in your typical spaghetti western. It continues this way for the rest of the movie, with the occasional addition of odd non-musical sounds.\n\n As it turns out, this score fits this particular western very well. The focus isn&apos;t on action, but more on the various conflicts between the characters. The first half of the movie almost exclusively takes place in a coach stop building and its adjacent barn, where most of the players first meet up and start all the conflicts. This half of the movie actually comes close to being a kind of thriller, with various characters getting the upper hand at various moments, people with secrets, and an underlying feeling of tension.\n\nAll these going-ons played out with the odd score actually make the movie kind of creepy, and this feeling continues in the second half when the characters hit the trail and cross the desolate landscape. Director Giuseppe Vari keeps a feeling of mystery and uncertainty right to the end, adding some unusual camera angles to highlight this kind of disorientation. He also has a great assett with having the great Klaus Kinski as the chief villain. Though Kinski is dubbed (and with a voice that sounds far from what he sounded like in real life), he still proves a powerful villain with his creepy facial expressions and movements. Even when he simply stretches out, he does it in a way that gives you the creeps! \n\nHighly recommended, if you can find it."

Careful what you wish for! Also with Moon Unit Zappa. 3) &quot;The Benediction&quot; is a Duel take-off with Lance Henriksen as a priest who has lost his faith and may have run into the devil in the form of a menacing black truck on the highway. 4) &quot;Night of the Rat&quot; features a suburban family terrorized by, you guessed it, rats. With Richard Masur and Veronica Cartwright.\n\nThe effects are chintzy (including some very early computer effects), and a lot of it is one-note. But there&apos;s a camp charm to it, and it makes good viewing for those in the mood for some cheesy but not ghastly frights. Featuring some early 80&apos;s punk music by the likes of X, Black Flag, and Fear.",

I know the movie is about Bill Bixby and the kids but really, it&apos;s all about Conway and Knotts. They worked so well together that even if the rest of the movie was worthless, they made it incredible. If you watch the scenes with the two of them moving the ladder, you&apos;d swear that all of that was storyboarded and choreographed, but according to Conway on the special edition DVD, they improvised all of it. The bit with Knotts drinking out of the beer glass and Conway trying to get a drink out of too is some of the greatest schtick in movie history. This is a great movie with a great cast including Slim Pickens and Harry Morgan and some of the finest character actors of the day. It&apos;s great and even if you don&apos;t like live-action Disney movies, you should still be able to appreciate the comic genius of Conway and Knotts."

Unfortunately, we&apos;re tipped off at the beginning of the film that it was shot in Bulgaria (where?)with a Bulgarian crew etc. This is when a film should save it&apos;s credits for the end of the movie. A few minutes into the flick, we are told via a caption, that the story takes place in New Mexico. Even if my eyes were shut tight during opening credits--I&apos;d know in a heartbeat that the location isn&apos;t New Mexico. Instead, what we see is an Alamo style house on the edge of a Bulgarian forest with tall looming trees behind it. Are they kidding? I can understand saving money by shooting in Bulgaria(where?)but how could they expect us (in the USA) to believe that it was New Mexico? Why not say Oregon or some other geographically similar location? Instead, all we see are gray skies and obviously freezing cold outdoor shots with shivering actors. There are so many gaffes in this straight to DVD movie that it is incredibly distracting. We see shots of a pool at night with a pool cover on it, then, in the next shot, it&apos;s off. Steam rising out of this pool (cold in Bulgaria...where?) There were very few shots of the baby in it&apos;s monster guise and we as the audience, can&apos;t understand why no one can see what&apos;s up with this kid. The baby&apos;s father is never around and when he is, never seems to have a clue that this kid is a little monster.\n\nThe entire New Mexico police force consisted of 2 cops, both of which made Inspector Clouseau look like Sherlock Holmes. They never ask for back up (they didn&apos;t have shoulder radios) even when being attacked by this 10 lb wunderkind. As a matter of fact these police were wearing generic uniforms with no insignia etc.\n\nThe acting was OK up until the mommy (played by Bijou Philips)started to think she was actually in a film that may get some notice and began to ham it up to the point of it being embarrassing.\n\nI think that everyone associated with the remake of this camp classic should&apos;ve watched the movie &quot;Grace&quot; if they wanted to see a terrifying movie about a demon child. That was a well done film--great dialog and acting, both subtle and scary to the point of making me squirm in my seat and giving me nightmares. Well, It&apos;s Alive gave me nightmares too. I dreamt that I wasted a $1.07 at Red Box.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is one of my favorites.\n\nThe disturbing topic of a woman who can&apos;t deal with the loss of her husband and child transforms into an essay on the impossibility of isolation. It is a quiet, personal movie that spends most of it&apos;s time with the main character played excellently by Juliette Binoche.\n\nThe color blue is very evident in the film,and a fade to a simple blue screen is used to show times of deep emotion. Although the characters are set in a specific time and place ( France just before the formation of the EU ) the focus on the personal journey of grief transcends the setting.\n\nI like the way this film changes from a story about a death to an affirmation to life. I like the way that little things like mice in the apartment loom large in the thought of our main character, where as what others consider important such as finishing her husband&apos;s symphony seem very minor .\n\nIt feels like diving deep through cold dark water to finally swim toward the light. One passes through emotional turmoil to come out the other side. I found it a very satisfying."

And if you get rid of them and get to that lab in the middle of the desert, as did Guy Madison, there you date different kind of Bedouins, dressed in white robes.

      "reviewBody": "Producer-star Helen Gardner has doubtless seen the Italian &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, and this &quot;Cleopatra&quot; runs an amazing 90 minutes for a 1912 feature (with 106 title cards!)  &quot;Cleopatra&quot; is a case of trial and discovery in this exploratory era of American features.  The first hour is filmed in the static &quot;Film d&apos;Art&quot; style, save for one brief insert added probably very late in the production, and the modern viewer begins to wish that the camera were moved even just a bit closer to the stagebound action, despite the elaborate, if somewhat primitive, stage dressing.  In the last third of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; more shots and setups are used, by far, than in the first two thirds.  We also find the camera is moving closer to the actors and less of a concern is shown towards exposing the sets, costumes, and extras, resulting in an entirely more satisfying and intimate cinematic experience, though some of this section of the film is choppy in the GEH print aired on TCM.  My feeling is that &quot;Cleopatra&quot; is a textbook example of how feature-length filmmaking helped open up possibilities towards a more sophisticated style of onscreen direction, cutting and camera setups. Gardner &amp; co. are literally discovering as they go, and it seems much of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was filmed in story sequence.  By shooting using gradually smaller parts of the set, and closer to the actors, Gardner created a film that had considerably more dramatic power in the end result than was generally required by 1912 standards, and on this alone the film remains a genuine step-forward for the fledgling American feature industry.",

The real story -with generous amounts of fiction, I suppose- of Mexican bullfighter Luis Procuna, from his childhood dreams to his initiation and consecration in the arena, from the terrible hazards of the job to the overcoming of the adversities and triumphal return. Half fiction, half documentary, it has a good mix of both, but otherwise is a simple story of success without interesting twist. The best parts are the ferocious spectators that are much harder to tame that the bull itself, and the sequence of the bullfighter&apos;s fear that keeps him far the bulls for a long time."

      "reviewBody": "At the beginning of the 1970s Germany&apos;s film industry was looking for a new formula for success, since the public&apos;s interest in the Edgar Wallace films was declining.  It found two: episodic sex comedies were the one, and movies based on the novels by Johannes Mario Simmel were the other.  Here we have a film of the latter kind, directed by a former Edgar Wallace regular: Alfred Vohrer.\n\nThe settings of Simmel&apos;s stories were typically high society in some form or another, and had often a bit of intrigue, crime, and even murder thrown into them.  So this allowed the filmmakers to go for glamorous characters, living a glamorous lifestyle, with glamorous friends and enemies. &apos;Und Jimmy ging zum Regenbogen&apos; very much fits into this picture.\n\nTherefore, the emphasis is less on the somewhat dubious story but rather on the surroundings.  These people here live in big houses, travel by plane, use computers (yes, it used to be glamorous once), had contact with SS officers etc. etc.  As non-promising as all of this may sound, there is nothing wrong with the way Vohrer filmed the story and overall this is certainly one of the better filmings of a Simmel novel.  It is quite watchable if you do not pay too much attention to detail (e.g. the decoding session at the computer is unintentionally funny, for any semi-literate computer user) but instead try to get into the mood of the picture.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Code Inconnu&quot; is an utterly original, even revolutionary piece from the Austrian director who continually refuses to compromise and pander to an audience.\n\nMany of the reviews on this site focus on the coherence of the film and suggest that the film lacks meaning or narrative, or even that the film is a failure because it is not easily comprehended. This is untrue and deeply unfair.\n\n&quot;Code Inconnu&quot; is not an immediate film. Indeed it may take several viewings to really come to grips with the meaning of the film - certainly there is not a single definitive meaning. For many film viewers when the basic linear narrative is remote. Again this adds to the view that the meaning of this obscured film is pointless. However this is more a reflection of the viewer and of audience expectation than of this film.\n\nIn a series of free standing vignettes Haneke has fashioned a moral conundrum without an answer. Much like in life itself. But rather than searching for meaning or answers Haneke is daring us to confront the questions themselves. The themes here are obviously about racism and reality, but also conscience and the consequence of our actions. By linking his separate characters initially Haneke points out that we are tenuously linked to people by uncontrollable events. By setting his film in Parisian streets, Hanekes film becomes recognizable of all our lives.\n\nThe central performance from Binoche is equally ambiguous, again this adds to the strength of the piece, but also the difficulty inherent in it.\n\nThe best way to view this film is as a series of questions which have no easy answer. The code is indeed unknown. By viewing each episode as a single moral conundrum the film takes on a very interesting and worthwhile dimension.",

The only thing I remember before this projection is that&apos;s a sad story between Romy and a kid in the Nazi time. surprised to be back in the Paris of the 80s as the start of the movie as it remains a golden period for me. In France, everyone, everything seems filled with a sense of new age, new spirit, new ideas that technology today fails to bring. For those like me who interests in human rights, you can see that maybe the world has gone in a good direction as all the abuses Piccolli addresses in his speech are now closed: Ireland, Apartheid, South America, USSR. \n\nThen, the movie goes indeed back to time and it&apos;s a bit &quot;Schindler&apos;s list&quot; and &quot;Music Box&quot; before them. Usually now, when a single mother is left with her kid, i get anxious for the family but here it wasn&apos;t really my feeling: the kid is too much in Oedipus complex and Romy is too much into her husband. Nothing really happens between them. Piccoli is as serious and rock as usual and it&apos;s a bit strange that he begins as the youngest character and ends like the oldest (as the make-up are not really good). \n\nIn my opinion, all the emotion of the movie comes from Gerard Klein, who plays the typical easy-going French: at first, he can&apos;t believe the Nazi system and finally comes to discover it. The final twist is accurate as vengeance can be a never-ending drama and it offers the opportunity to Jean Reno to claim he has played with Romy!",

The main character is kind of smart and kind of stupid and has no idea what she&apos;s doing. I think that&apos;s pretty realistic for a 13 year old runaway. They&apos;re not always going to do things that make sense.\n\nI thought the acting was pretty good. I like how it was shot. I like the time period and thought they did a pretty good job depicting rural America in the 80s. How it looked, how it felt. It&apos;s little things like the radio that was from the 70s or maybe even the 60s. In lots of period films they stuff the whole thing full of objects from the 80s, but that&apos;s not how people live. Particular poor people will have some older stuff around. There were some nice details like that.",

I think that if you are looking for a movie to sit down and watch and not want it to be over then you have found the right movie Gold Diggers can make you laugh, cry, and wonder what&apos;s going to happen next all at the same time! So if you have yet to see this wonderful movie don&apos;t pass it up, go see it now! \n\nPS, See this movie, you have to!"

I agree it is a movie made especially for Christians, and its ideas on the rapture are debatable, but beyond that its about finding God and overcoming your doubts as are the rest of the films in the series. The thing about the tree with Eileen&apos;s name on it. Its about knowing God in a very uncertain world. These films, although overtly are about the rapture and tribulation they are more subtly about knowing God and his redemption. Plus this film might be Gary Bussey&apos;s best role ever. A rare gem in the midst of a sea of B films. This film is something that I would recommend for any Christian struggling with their faith. It is not for everybody. The script was strong in places and I will agree it was a low budget production, but I would recommend it."

It is basically a samurai movie made as a Japanese western with Japanese cowboys instead of samurais. The story is almost the same as Yojimbo/A Fistfull of dollars. Stranger comes into town and gets the 2 opposing gangs to start killing each other. The difference being he has a sidekick in the kick ass Bloody Benten (female gunslinger). I think what makes everyone go &quot;huh?&quot; is its rather confusing opening with Quentin Tarantino and also the dialogue in heavily Japanese accented and enunciated English. It is rather jarring and does distract from the story. However if you have watched enough undubbed samurai movies you will be familiar with the style and delivery of the dialogue so the distraction goes away. The movie is nothing original but based on it simply being a gunfight movie its not bad.",

A great cast as well as songs.\n\nThe movie starts out with Raj (Salman Khan) going to Mumbai from Goa hoping to make it big in the music industry. But he finds out that things aren&apos;t as easy as they seem to be and he ends up staying at his friend&apos;s place. One night, he witnesses an accident and ends up saving the life of Pooja (Rani Mukherjee). Her family thinks that Raj is Pooja&apos;s husband as she left home to marry the guy she loves. Raj is not given a chance to explain but then he realizes that this is the opportunity he&apos;s been waiting for because her family was very rich. Pooja ends up in a coma but she can hear and see whatever is going on. Pooja&apos;s best friend, Jhanvi (Preity Zinta) comes in from the US after hearing about her accident and she meets Raj. She falls for him but doesn&apos;t do anything because she thinks that Raj is Pooja&apos;s husband. After she finds out that it is not true, she starts to fall in love with him. In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.\n\nThe rest of the story deals with how the situation is resolved and who finally gets Raj. It is a pretty good movie, but the first half was too long. There is only one song in there which I really like, and that is &apos;Piya Piya&apos;. The acting done by both the actresses was excellent! As for Salman, he overdoes it in some scenes and he really should think about getting another dress designer for himself! But, other than that, it is a watchable movie. Fans of Rani and Preity should definitely watch this movie!",

      "reviewBody": "Beautiful interiors and the detail of a picture by Arthur Davies observed through magnifying glass by an elderly Professor. The picture occurs to show a family... Can anyone realize that this painting shall soon constitute a prelude to such unpredictable events and reflections?\n\nLuchino Visconti did not make many movies in his career because he insisted on saying that his films related to the things that really captivated him. When he wanted to say something significant, he just made up his mind to commit himself to another production. And of course there are better and worse movies of his, naturally; however, I personally think that CONVERSATION PIECE (or rather the more accurate title GRUPPO DI FAMIGLIA IN UN INTERNO - group of the family within) is one of those movies that intensely reveals a desire to convey a message. Count Visconti is much different and older here than 30 years earlier in his OSSESSIONE but equally powerful.\n\nIt is truly a psychologically captivating image of a communication among people who are absolutely different in their coexistence. The Professor (Burt Lancaster) is a man of clearly defined ideas, an elderly intellectual who has already set down his life and seeks to be left alone among his &quot;mute pictures.&quot; However, a group of people intervene and insist on him to rent the elegant upper flat. These are Marchesa Bianca Brumonti (Silvana Mangano) with her lover Konrad (Helmut Berger), and her daughter Lietta (Claudia Marsani) with her boyfriend Stefano (Stefano Patrizi). Although they seem to be nice people at first sight, they occur to be a true riddle for the Professor who is gradually losing contact with reality. Their vulgar talk harms him and their open bisexuality shocks him. Things turn worse and, consequently, the suspicious events make the Professor more and more annoyed till the climax of events: emotional conversation. Then, the atmosphere gets most exciting, Marchesa drinks rare evening coffee and people harm themselves: some physically, some emotionally and some in both ways. Yet, no one can predict what this horrific climax moment will cause...\n\nThanks to unpredictable content and good action, the film occurs to be the Visconti&apos;s production of particular impression and interest. But that is not the only aspect that talks for the movie. Art is expressed in beautiful images, excellent interiors comparable to IL GATTOPARDO and some brilliant performances. I say &quot;some&quot; because not everyone gives a top notch performance. Burt Lancaster does the continuation of the magnetic job he did as Prince Salina in IL GATTOPARDO: he is very convincing as the Professor portraying a man desirous of stability, a bit intolerant and maniacal as he described elderly people, but overall a warm hearted reliable character so anxious with all sorts of sudden changes (moral ones too). Silvana Mangano is appealing as Marchesa Bianca: eminent, partly decadent, very elegant and nervous. She represents the other side of the older generation escaping not to books or paintings like the Professor but rather to life of luxury and extraordinary journeys. Yet, consequently, she also loses link with reality. She is more acknowledged of the world and alleged information than real dangers within her family. Youngsters, however, do not appear that convincing. Helmut Berger, though a good actor especially after his role in LUDWIG, appears to be a bit pathetic in the role of Konrad, Claudia Marsani is rather sensual and beautiful than talented and Stefano Patrizi does not appeal to me at all. Some good job among the supporting cast is done by Elvira Cortese as Erminia, the housekeeper who has some wonderfully witty moments. \n\nBut finally, I should address the most important aspect of the movie that makes it so impressive and so unique. It is the psychology of what is going on in the entire film, it is the constant attempt at communicating rather simple ideas, yet failing to do that. Why? Because the contrast is too serious: intellect vs parroting, mutual goodness vs hedonism, good will vs good fun, idealism vs materialism, the old vs the young with all specific fears and desires. That is the gist of the movie, that is what made the Professor realize and makes us realize a significant fact: it&apos;s really possible to speak one language, use the same codes, yet absolutely fail to communicate and coexist. It makes people remark the division of society, which is not a very privileged fact, but true one, unfortunately.\n\nCONVERSATION PIECE is a film I&apos;d recommend you to see. But remember one thing: it really has to do with the theme you are not likely to find elsewhere: shallow understanding of nothing and profound understanding of everything. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Throughout history there has been hardships for African Americans. Slavery, human rights, discrimination, and racism have been very obvious problems for them. Although they have gained their human rights and slavery has been abolished, discrimination and racism are still around in the twenty-first century. Within the romantic drama Save The Last Dance directed by Thomas Carter, 2001, it lets its viewers see and recognize what people are still like to this day when dealing with different races such as white and black. \n\nWithin this movie the main character Sara wants to be a ballerina. Her mother died in a car accident on her way to see her perform, in attempt to get into Sara Lawrence University. She had to move in with her father who is a struggling musician and live in a rundown apartment, in Chicago. Sara&apos;s new school is mainly of African American descent and she is the minority. She makes friends with a girl named Chenille and starts adopt some things that Chenille does in order to fit in. \n\nChenille has a brother Derek. Derek and Sara fall in love and it is hard for them because they get a lot of problems just because they are in interracial couple. Sara and Derek both get into fights defending themselves from their peers and friends. The explanation for Chenille to Sara about why she shouldn&apos;t be with Derek was because she was white. She said that since Sara was white, she was taking one of the only good men left for the black woman. This is complete discrimination against Sara, even thought Chenille is her best friend there in Chicago.\n\n. Sara who grew up in the southwest, was not used to this ghetto Chicago area. She was taught how to dance like everyone else, and started to listen to the same music as they did, so she would fit in and have a good time. Her best friend from home doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s even possibly for Sara to find a guy down where she is because no one is white. She asks questions such as, &quot;Have you seen anyone get shot yet?&quot; Such questions and statements show that the low class status of this neighborhood is discriminated against. \n\nSave The Last Dance portrays the discrimination that still going on during this day and age. Gun fights, death, clubs, music, romance, tragedy, dancing, and racism are all present within this movie. The lower class Chicago area shows how dangerous things can be. The events that happen between the Sara and Derek and other events within this movie truly show how America is still discriminatory towards people."

Some scenes and best lines, and the soundtrack too, are still on my mind. I simply wonder : why was the film never released again, neither for movie theaters nor TV or VHS/DVD? (or at least, I have never been able to locate it). I cannot understand this, for a film that is not just a comedy, but also an interesting witness of the time when the French public opinion was 100% pro-Israeli (this obviously has changed since 1967 and the Six-Day war). I heard that the film is not distributed owing to a dispute over its ownership. Please, whoever has part of the rights to this film, let me and other frustrated viewers see it again !

There are numerous flash backs, but the film flows at a good pace that it is not a distraction at all. \n\nThe storyline is very light hearted to begin with, but gets darker. Ashley Judd does a great performance as an Alcohol addicted mother and Ellen Burstyn is also good as the older character, played by Ashley Judd. The humour is funny enough and does not go overboard. See this film with your girl friends, and make sure you bring a box of Kleenex with you. A two thumbs up."

The original ADDAMS FAMILY movie had a horribly thin plot and stupid one-liners...but who cared...it had stunning cinematography and and set design!  Well, the sequel is less showy with its art direction and focuses more on making us laugh.  The screenplay was written by Paul Rudnick, who is the Messiah of One-liners.  His script has a wickedly dark sense of humor thats just irresistible.  Angelica Huston and Raul Julia are more sensual than ever. Christina Ricci is superb as Wednesday; she brings the perfect sense of melancholy and dryness to her character.  My favorite performace though was Joan Cusack, as the diabolical nanny Debbie.  She is just a blast to watch as a gold-digging psycho killer who wants Uncle Fester&apos;s money.  I loved how this movie satirizes the white upper class, which is a perfect contrast to the Addamses themselves. This is one hilarious movie."

      "reviewBody": "This documentary starts off with two truckers venturing an opinion that without those in their industry the entire American economy would grind to a standstill within three days. Although neither of them provided any economic research to support their contention their point was still quite compelling. From there the film then zeroes in on several truckers as they go about their business and provide us with personal insights on their daily lives. And it&apos;s the differences between them that cause this documentary to lose its overall focus as few of them share the same general concerns. For example, one female driver is so afraid for her safety at truck stops that she refuses to come out of her sleeper cab during the night. Meanwhile, another trucker has a woman in just about every town he stays in. But the person who really sticks out is the simpleton from Idaho who points to the Confederate flag on his dashboard and proclaims that it represented true &quot;freedom&quot; back in the day. Apparently, he didn&apos;t study history very well because, if he had, he would have known that under that same flag--which he proudly praises--were hundreds of thousands of slaves who were badly beaten and abused in the process. No doubt if they were alive today, they would gladly refute any ideas that they were living in &quot;freedom&quot;. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, he then goes on to voice his displeasure at the current government and loudly advocates for a revolution to overthrow it. Never mind that he has no real idea of what to replace it with. Apparently, he hasn&apos;t quite thought that far ahead. Be that as it may, the really fortunate thing is that--although he has the freedom to voice his opinion--others also have the freedom to disregard it for the ignorant ravings that they truly are. Ironically, the next scene features a different trucker informing us of how &quot;patriotic&quot; they are. No doubt most are--but I would venture to guess he never met the guy before him. In summation, although this documentary does offer a unique perspective on the life of several truckers, it lacks a consistent theme which diminishes the overall effect and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",

The film starts out in typical 50&apos;s sci-fi manner, and the first encounter between one of these caterpillar-looking creatures and a couple of sailors is rather good.  The creatures leave some gooey stuff, apparently saliva, by each victim.  The head of the base, a Twillinger, begins to try and find out what killed his men with the aid of scientist Hans Conried.  Tim Holt, the fella that played Curtain in Treasure of the Sierra Madre, plays Twillinger(Twill), a brusque, by the book, no nonsense guy.  It wasn&apos;t till near the end of the picture I realized it was Holt(having missed opening credits) as he was like a balloon compared to his early western films. Nonetheless Holt effectively takes charge of this &quot;sticky&quot; situation.  Hans Conried excels as the scientist.  The film is not a great sci-fi film, but it is an exciting one with a good pace, good acting, and decent special effects."

The trio of Salman, Priyanka, and Akshay gave a good performance. &quot;Jeene Ke Hai 4 Din&quot; and &quot;Lal Dupatta&quot; were good songs. The others were average. The climax was nice and improved the movie quite a bit as it was going quite downhill towards the end. Akshay Kumar&apos;s star power seems to be gradually increasing day-by-day as his movies seem to be doing quite well. This movie is not bad; it&apos;s a good timepass.",

      "reviewBody": "A haunted fridge? Hmmmm, alright, well that is a new idea, I will say that much.\n\nFor a horror movie, then &quot;Pridyider&quot; was anything but scary. That being said, then the movie isn&apos;t a total waste. The story was nicely executed, although the storyline was rather well out there. I mean, a haunted fridge, come on...\n\nThe storyline, shortly summarized, is about Tina who returns back to the Philippines from the US, where she has to live alone in her family&apos;s house - a house that holds a macabre and dark secret. A single piece at a time, Tina starts to learn about the dreadful secret that ties her estranged mother and father to the house. And the air is thick with tension as the house turns out to be haunted by its past...\n\nThe acting in the movie was actually alright, although personally I had someone of a struggle to cope with the constant switching between Tagalog and English language in the movie. It adds a frustrating and confusing element to the overall enjoyment of the movie - but they do talk that way in the Philippines, so...\n\nEffects-wise, then &quot;Pridyider&quot; was actually also quite alright. Don&apos;t expect major blockbuster Hollywood CGI effects, of course. But the effects incorporated in the movie worked out nicely to help the story along. And there were some pretty good scenes with the gore and dismembered body parts in the fridge - I enjoyed that, and it was a notch up in the enjoyment of the movie.\n\nAs mentioned above, then &quot;Pridyider&quot; is devoid of scares and a proper horror atmosphere. However, having only seen two other Philippine horror movies, then I don&apos;t have much background to base a judgment on how scary it is to the natives there, but for me, as a seasoned horror aficionado in Europe, then &quot;Pridyider&quot; was very &apos;child-friendly&apos;. So don&apos;t expect to be scared out of your seat here.\n\nAnd the title of the movie, &quot;Pridyider&quot;, is short, simple and to the point, translated as &quot;Refrigerator&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Just two years before Vittorio De Sica changed the world with The Bicycle Thieves (1948), the universally famous actor/director made a small, simple and beautiful movie by the name of Shoeshine (1946). Taking place in war ravaged Italy, the film features the stories of two young shoeshine boys who are tasked with delivering black market goods and get caught in a web of intrigue. Once they are caught by the police, their friendship is challenged when they&apos;re sent to an overcrowded boy&apos;s penitentiary.\n\nThe majority of the film takes place in the penitentiary where the two boys (Franco Interlenghi and Rinaldo Smordoni) are separated from each other almost instantly. Forced into separate cells each holding five boys, they become the center of their own maelstroms when one mistakenly betrays the other. I won&apos;t ruin the whole picture other than mentioning that the main source of motivation early on is a horse they bought together.\n\nThe period sets the tone for the film. Despite a bouncy score that highlights every small victory experienced by the characters, the lack of sustenance and poor conditions of life in and out of the penitentiary keeps things gloomy. The boys eat gruel which the warden calls &quot;passable&quot;, medical help is slow and ineffective and beds are riddled with lice. Even one of the more kind-hearted superiors finds objection to the state of things. Yet at one point one of the boys calls his new home &quot;paradise&quot; because of its only slightly better living standard than sleeping in an elevator.\n\nThe film is considered one of the first Italian neorealist works which would leave an indelible mark on Italian cinema and movies worldwide. The form contends with economic hardship and moral denigration as a canvas. Many times they would shoot in and around the streets of Italian cities and even hire non-professional actors to intensify the realism. Often this was for practical reasons. The aftermath of World War Two left the film industry (previously under the close watch of Mussolini) unable to maintain their studios.\n\nThe Bicycle Thieves stands as the pinnacle of Italian neo-realism but for my money Shoeshine is the better movie. Both stories are quite compelling but from an outsider&apos;s perspective, the multiple Italian customs and the research required to understand them are much more-a- plenty in Bicycle Thieves. Additionally the main characters of Shoeshine are children no older than twelve. While in many cases this would be a slight when comparing one movie to another, the actors in Shoeshine act much more authentically to their predicament. There is one scene where the boys trot a horse down the street as the other shoeshine boys either cheer in zeal, or jeer in jealousy. They preen and strut like they&apos;re the talk of the town, the belle of the ball, or to put another way; two poor kids with a horse. How can you not smile at that image?\n\nThere is a famous review of Shoeshine by the famous Pauline Kael where she mentions a &quot; petulant voice of a college girl complaining to her boyfriend, &apos;well, I don&apos;t see what was so special about that movie.&apos;&quot; She then claimed alienation from those who could not experience &quot;the radiance of Shoeshine.&quot; In many ways I feel the same about it. If you&apos;re not effected by De Sica&apos;s first classic then you&apos;re not fully human.\n\nhttp://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

The first half is far too slow to be a comedy, and the second half is far too heavy on words. The pacing and the tone are just not right to be a comedy. It might be entertaining to see two guys trying to work their way out of the awkward situation without having to sacrifice their reputation, but there is simply not enough material to fill 90 minutes. The film stretches for far too long, and it gets quite boring. I think it would have been better marketed as an indie drama."

      "name": "If you cut down a lemon grove, what is left?",
      "reviewBody": "Etz Limon (2008) directed by Eran Riklis, was shown in the United States with the title &quot;Lemon Tree.&quot; (Don&apos;t confuse the film with a popular novel that has the same title.) The plot of the story is simple enough. The Israeli defense minister moves into a home located right next to a lemon grove owned by a Palestinian woman. Israeli security agents decide that the grove presents a hazard to the minister and his wife, and declare that the lemon trees must be destroyed. The Palestinian woman fights the destruction of her livelihood and her legacy.\n\nAlthough the basic plot of &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; is simple, the movie is complex. There are fascinating interactions between the woman--Salma Zidane, played by the incomparable Hiam Abbass--and her lawyer and her children. The defense minister has a edgy relationship with his wife. (His wife is basically a fair and caring woman, and isn&apos;t supportive of the grove&apos;s destruction, but she also likes being married to a powerful, charismatic public figure.) The defense minister is obviously very close to a beautiful young aide, and the movie suggests that they&apos;re having an affair.\n\nAlthough the film is clearly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, all of the Palestinians aren&apos;t portrayed as perfect individuals. One local Palestinian leader doesn&apos;t suggest any course of action for Salma, but warns her not to accept compensation from the Israelis. Refusal to accept compensation probably makes sense as a political strategy. However, without compensation, what options are open to a widow whose sole livelihood is taken from her?\n\nTo me, the saddest part of the movie was the failure of Salma and the minister&apos;s wife Mira (Rona Lipaz-Michael) to ever meet face to face. On several occasions in the film they almost meet, but the meeting never actually takes place. Symbolically, that failure to communicate on a personal level represents the Israeli-Palestinian dilemma. They are figuratively and literally unable to speak to each other, and therefore they can never move beyond stereotypes and hostility.\n\nWe saw this film at the excellent Rochester Jewish Film Festival. However, it would work well on the small screen. It&apos;s an extraordinary film, and definitely worth seeking out.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps not the big names as the first two installments of the series, but an enjoyable movie that teaches that you don&apos;t have to be biggest or the best, as long as you give it all you&apos;ve got and have fun. Scott Backula gives a great and convincing performance as a minor league coach, Ted McGinley does what he does best, play a self centered egotistical, overbearing idiot. He has been brilliant with the same type character in vehicles like &quot;Married With Children.&quot; Who else could have pulled this character off. This movie delves into some of the situations faced by both major and minor league players. There are good players who spend their entire baseball careers in minor league. In the days we live in of multimillion contracts, and players who think they are gods, it might be better to see men who play the sport more for fun than money. Perhaps if some of the Major League stars in real life would learn to have fun playing, then we as fans would get a better game.",

Maciste who is nicknamed Hercules in US must use all his strength to save the girl he loves from malicious emperor (Peter White) and the Pretorians captain (Robert Hundar) making a desperate bid to rescue the Christians . The picture is a undercover version of ¨Quo Vadis¨ but with lack luster and budget , thus our hero (Mark Forest) like Marco Vinicio (Robert Taylor) must save his sweetheart Christian of the Emperor Vitelio likeness to Nero (Peter Ustinov) and his villain guards chief (Robert Hundar, an usual of Spaghetti Western) similar to wicked Tijelinus .\n\nThe film gets dramatic scenes of gladiators combats in the arena and martyrdom Christians and stunningly cheap special effects as the shots and closeups of a giant rubber gorilla which is a man suited struggling against Maciste . The robust and strong Maciste or Hercules is Mark Forest in a wooden acting , he was a muscleman who left allegedly the sword and sandals genre for the Opera , he used the amount of money he made acting as gladiator films in Italy to study Opera , he currently teaches it in the Los Angeles zone . He was one along with Ed Fury , Dan Vadis , Alan Steel , Reg Park , Gordon Scott whom to seek fortune and fame interpreting absurdly muscle mythological figures but nobody topped Steve Reeves in popularity . The film will appeal to Spaghetti myth-opera although is a better than most muscle opera , thanks to expert director Mario Caiano .",

      "reviewBody": "When one talks about Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford as a screen team, one is primarily talking about Gilda. There first film, The Lady in Question had them as featured players, second was the classic Gilda, third was The Loves of Carmen with a horribly miscast Glenn Ford. It was after that one, that Rita Hayworth married Aly Khan and was off the screen for four years.\n\nWhen she came back, Harry Cohn decided not to be too adventurous. Her last big success was Gilda with Glenn Ford, she got Glenn Ford. She was a singer stranded in the southern hemisphere in Gilda, she was again a singer stranded in Affair in Trinidad. Stepping into the George MacReady&apos;s shoes as villainous mastermind is suave and continental Alexander Scourby.\n\nRita&apos;s husband is murdered and the Trinidad police inspector Torin Thatcher knows full well Alexander Scourby is behind it. Scourby is your international man of mystery in the Sydney Greenstreet, Orson Welles tradition. Thatcher wants Rita to spy on Scourby and she agrees to find out exactly what he&apos;s up to.\n\nIn comes Glenn Ford into the picture as her late husband&apos;s brother. He wants some answers and nearly succeeds in wrecking the whole project. Good thing Rita&apos;s a quick thinking girl, a better thing is that Ford&apos;s a man of action, helps them both out in a pinch.\n\nCome to think of it, though Alexander Scourby is a fine player, Orson Welles would have owned this part and even better if he had directed Affair in Trinidad. This is just the kind of story that someone like him could have made into a classic. What a film to remember with Rita with her most well known co-star and another ex-husband as well.\n\nHarry Cohn probably would have shot anyone who brought him that idea, still it&apos;s interesting to speculate.\n\nThough Affair in Trinidad got panned by critics it cleaned up at the box office with all of Rita&apos;s loyal fans wanting to see her again. It&apos;s still a treat for fans of the screen&apos;s greatest sex symbol.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t impressed by the first &apos;Ring Of Fire&apos; as it went thru the barrel of story cliches, low level martial arts. However I&apos;ve always been a fan of giving credit where credit is due and the follow-up &apos;Blood and Steel&apos; up&apos;s the ante a little. Some legitimate cool explosions, returning faces and a few new ones. If you delight in cheesy beat &apos;em ups there&apos;s pieces to enjoy, but quality does drop off in a real way.\n\nDoctor Johnny Woo (Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; Wilson) and his girlfriend Julie (Maria Ford) are at a jewelry store when a gang of masked thugs start robbing it. Woo leaps into action when Julie gets shot, taking down one of the goons as the rest escape. As she lays in the hospital recovering the gang and leader Kalin (Ian Jacklin) show up to retrieve the member who turns out to be his brother. Fighting them off, Johnny accidently makes the wounded member take a bullet to the head, Kalin swears vengeance, takes Julie hostage where the gang resides underground and men fight to the death in a ring.\n\nWith a recap like that, I don&apos;t have to spell out the big hunk of cheese that it is. Though it&apos;s notable how this pic (and ones like it) had to trim the fat and deliver action beats quick &amp; steadily to it&apos;s core audience. Early on and for the finale this supplies those cool explosions I talked about. Like for real ... the pyro guy had a field day. Unfortunately when it retreats to underground the fisticuffs are generic, not shot very well and largely become a bore. Simple villains plus some downright weird ideas injected here. Through dark halls, basements you watch as Woo dispatches goofy dressed thugs then his trailing ragtag group of pals do the same.\n\nMichael DeLano returns as Lopez (detective from the first) but is much less the a-hole. As do Vince Murdocco, Dale Jacoby who were enemies but now friends of Johnny. Ditto Eric Lee, Ron Yuan. Honestly the cast is the best part. Sy Richardson (Repo Man) gets a role as a new ally while Gerald Okamura (Sidaris regular), Evan Lurie (no stranger to martial arts flicks) do baddies. Models, T&amp;A names Ashlie Rhey, Carrie Westcott but shockingly none of the ladies here supply any nudity.\n\n&apos;Ring of Fire II: Blood and Steel&apos; is pretty much in the same realm as the original barring minor improvements. Fans of Wilson or PM fare might want to check it out, but it&apos;s nothing to get excited about. They&apos;d follow up with another sequel a year later &apos;Lion Strike&apos; to complete the trilogy (of sorts) about a doc who always saves the day.",

In between the trial we are given glimpses of Ginsberg&apos;s life (in black and white) and an interview with him. The black and white sequences are beautifully shot. The style reminds one of French movies from the 50s. The recital of the poems takes some getting used to but once it is coupled with the animated sequence there&apos;s no turning back. It brings the poetry to life. Those are the highlights of the film. Moreover the animation is beautifully done. The pacing is uneven as its slow at times (especially in the beginning). I would have liked to have seen more glimpses of Ginsberg&apos;s life. The actors do a fairly decent job. James Franco does a good enough job and he is well supported by David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, Bob Balaban, Alessandro Nivola and Mary-Louise Parker. Overall, &apos;Howl&apos; is an intriguing account and does quite well in introducing Ginsberg&apos;s poems to those who are not familiar with his works. The animation gives it a unique touch."

After seeing Jackie play children who always had some kind of drama going on in his characters lives and crying all the time, it was nice to see him as a nice young man who grew from being immature and selfish to mature, unselfish, and grateful. \n\nIn many of Jackie Cooper&apos;s films he played characters who were much younger than his actual age (ex: O&apos;Shaunessy&apos;s Boy (1935), in real life he was about 12 or 13, but in the film, he is playing someone who is about 10 or 11, same in Dinky and in Tough Guy (1936), he was really 13 or 14, but in the film he is probably between the ages of 9-11). So, in White Banners it was nice seeing him someone his own age and he gave a touching and challenging performance. I also must commend Fay Bainter (1938 Academy Award nominee Best Actress (Banners) and supporting actress (Jezebel)), for she gave an excellent performance as a mother who sacrifices the best for her child. Also the rest of the cast was great. An excellent film!",

      "reviewBody": "I got this movie in a video store bargain bin as an used copy. The cover was appealing as i am interested in WW2 and i like boxing as well. Then it was in my shelve for a while as i was intending to watch it with my cousin who likes both subject as well. But then at some point i decided to watch it anyway, and realize it was sporting the name of ... UWE BOLL on it. Oh boy... i decided to put it in the shelve and include it in my next pawnshop movie sell(i do that once in a while as i buy pretty much all my movies used in video store, i don&apos;t rent much and i hate video on demand) So as i was making my movie pile for the pawnshop, i decided i should at least give it a go, after all, my Boll hate comes mostly from him destroying video game licences and i actually did enjoy Rampage.\n\nThe movie is in German, but i choose to watch it English dubbed. I am not a fan of English dubbed, but i tough it was rather OK in this, the voices didn&apos;t bother me too much. I come from a french province so i am used to french dubbing, but not English ones. Anyway yes the acting was so-so, but not that bad. I could get into the movie. I think his boxing years where pretty well done, the fights whee numerous and entertaining, i was actually surprised. I think the war segments and how the Nazis saw him could had been way better done, but then again it was not the point of the movie per say.\n\nOverall i am surprised... its a decent movie, even tough its made to by Boll. Got to give credit where its due, I&apos;m sure if the movie would had been dubbed in french i would had even more fun watching it. There is nothing spectacular but the movie don&apos;t feel too cheap or whatever and i didn&apos;t knew Max Schmelling at all, so now i want to look him up on wikipedia.\n\nSo yeah, i liked the movie. Will i keep it or pawnshop it? I dunno yet, it was way better than expected.",

Her innocence permeates through heart.. I bought it for Dev Anand but even he looks a bore before Geeta Bali.\n\nLove you Geeta Bali love you.\n\nI am looking forward to watch her again in movies like Pocketmar, Albela, a movie with Raj Kapoor I forgot its name nevertheless I would find it on internet\n\nShe was such a divine talent that now she is on top of the list of my favorites \n\nAgain lots of love to you Geeta\n\nyours truly"

      "reviewBody": "Dragon Rapide was an ordinary, small private De Havilland DH-89 aircraft that played an important role in the outbreak of the 2nd Spanish Civil War in July 1936. It was chartered in London by the part of the military conspirators who were about to rise in rebellion against the legitimate Republican government (communist, de facto, since the advent of the Popular Front) with the mission to fly discreetly to the Canary Islands to take General Franco from here to Spanish North Africa (Morocco nowadays) to meet the bulk of the rebel faction of the army he&apos;ll eventually lead through three dramatic years of civil war until the rendition of the capital, Madrid.\n\nThe movie opens showing the weeks prior to the military uprising and how the conspirators react and complete their plans. Some of the highest ranked generals (Franco, Mola, Goded, Fanjul) are of course men who were conservative, religious and raised in the traditional values. They (as about half of the Spanish population and Military) are growing increasingly worried about the reign of terror that is becoming Spain under the atrocities made by the armed and uncontrolled communist militias and the lack of interest and authority of the Republican government to stop them. Finally, the generals make the decision to go ahead with the uprising and to protect the Nation... even against the legitimate Government.\n\nIf you are not Spanish, just consider this: In your standard Civil War there is a geographical factor: North against South, East vs West and so on, but in the case of Spain it was mostly a political and moral gap that made the difference: It was lefts vs rights and that implied religion versus laicism/atheism... so in many many cases the civil war divided tragically families, cities and neighborhoods, fathers against sons, brothers vs. sisters.\n\nThe Spanish politic and social factors involved in the Civil War and its causes and consequences are much too complex to be fully analized in the film or in this humble synopsis. Even today the wounds of the Civil War (1936-39) and the subsequent 36 years of military government/dictatorship under Franco (1939-1975) are so fresh in every individual, in every family on both sides. It is still a hot and conflictive subject where little objectivity is achieved: There is no political &quot;center&quot; on Spain, just Lefts and Rights. I was born 34 years ago, just when Franco died, and even many people of my generation have grandfathers and elder relatives who fought and/or died and/or were imprisoned in both sides, so opinions use to be so HOT.\n\nDue to the complex background of the Civil War some very important factors on it are not shown at all and others are shown or explained only slightly, but that&apos;s not the intention of this movie - it&apos;s not a documentary after all. In general terms I must say it is a quite impartial, fair version of both sides&apos; points of view - just a little bit lefty, but definitely far more impartial than the bulk of movies made about Spanish Civil War in Spain and abroad. It is the only film that I can recall that reflects the very important fact that Franco was not the only high-ranking General that was involved, and he had roughly about half of the military and the people with him The depictions of Generals Franco and Mola are well portrayed and their motivations are seen and explained with a fair objectivity. In the average lefty Spanish movie all the National side from Franco to the last soldier are just insane nazi bad guys with the only interest of killing and causing terror withour reason - just like Freddy Krueger or Leatherface. That&apos;s totally unfair and that&apos;s ABSOLUTELY not historically true and that&apos;s not funny or interesting neither. Right or wrong, they were exceptionally prepared generals and intelligent individuals and their decisions were so complex and painful - to go to war against half of their own country, which they swore to protect. All those movies done from political resentment lose that juicy main point from the very beginning, considering only one side of the story (THEIR side, of course).\n\nIn all, the main, &quot;high-level&quot; political and historical facts are well intertwined with the smaller layer composed by the individual characters and their minor stories, helplessly caught in the unstoppable spiral of violence of a divided country that they know will lead to a civil war. The costumes and props also show a good job, without excess - the atmosphere created looks like an adequate recreation of the Spanish 1930&apos;s. A nice, clean, well-balanced movie in general terms, in my humble opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "Darryl F. Zanuck covered Napoleon&apos;s sweep across Europe in two early films: &quot;Lloyds of London,&quot; in which Tyrone Power plays a fictional character who continues insuring the British fleet so that his childhood friend, Horatio Nelson, can win the war; and &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; in which Nathan Rothschild and his banker brothers provide the financing to beat Napoleon. Both are excellent films.\n\nThere are a few historical liberties in &quot;The House of Rothschild,&quot; but the film is based on fact. George Arliss has a dual role as Mayer Rothschild and his son, Nathan. When the film begins, the family is living in a Prussian Jewish ghetto where Mayer is doing well but doesn&apos;t want the tax collectors to know. On his deathbed, he instructs his sons to establish banking houses throughout Europe as so much money is stolen when it is being carried by messengers. The plot then focuses on Nathan and goes into the rampant anti-Semitism which forces Nathan out of an important loan. It also shows his brilliance for business as he fights Count Ledrantz (Boris Karloff) who spreads propaganda and incites pogroms. The climax of the film takes place when it appears Napoleon is winning and Nathan starts buying up everything on the stock market, which is bottoming out, in order to keep the deal he made for the war effort. Though not much is made of it, the Rothschilds had informants everywhere, which enabled them to get information before anyone else. He is able to announce before it is made public that Napoleon has been defeated at Waterloo.\n\n&quot;House of Rothschild&quot; stars one of the great actors, George Arliss. Other actors from the stage entering films often used tremulous voices and melodramatic gestures but Arliss had a tremendous speaking voice and a grand acting style that made a powerful impression on the screen and infused the characters he played with a believability as well. A blond, beautiful Loretta Young is on hand as his daughter, who is in love with a Gentile named Fitzroy (Robert Young) - and though one would expect the love story to be fiction, it isn&apos;t.\n\nThis film has an interesting history of its own: Excerpts from it, taken out of context, were used in the anti-semitic Nazi films Der ewige Jude and Die Rothschilds. Despite persecution, the Rothschilds remain an extremely powerful family in the present - the original name of the family was Bauer; Rothschild is actually German for &quot;red shield,&quot; which is in the center of the family coat of arms. Today, they&apos;re in a variety of occupations besides banking - actress Helena Bonham Carter is a Rothschild due to a marriage on her mother&apos;s side.",

Shammi Kapoor is debonair and restless, and Sharmila Tagore delightfully coy. The two complement each other wonderfully and their chemistry works even today. There is some unnecessary melodrama towards the end and the film would have been better served without it. Still quite enjoyable.\n\nOverall 7/10"

THE MONSTER ARMY (Thai title: HANUMAN AND THE 7 ULTRAMEN) is the FX (directed by veteran Kazuo Sagawa) and monster/superhero action. But overall, as an Ultra-fan, I have to say that this is, by far, the worst, weakest Ultraman film EVER! If people hate GODZILLA VS. MEGALON so much, THE 6 ULTRA BROTHERS VS. THE MONSTER ARMY makes it look like Oscar-winning material.\n\nThe Hindu monkey-god Hanuman takes center stage in this film, so I think this film would&apos;ve made a better solo vehicle for Hanuman. Otherwise the Ultra Brothers themselves (Ultraman, Zoffy, Ultra Seven, New Ultraman/Jack, Ultraman Ace and Ultraman Tarou) are just glorified henchmen for Hanuman, and they don&apos;t get as much screen time until the climactic 30 minutes. Also, the Ultra Brothers and monster suits (the monsters were Gomora from ULTRAMAN, Dustpan from MIRRORMAN, and Astromons, Tyranto and Dorobon from ULTRAMAN TAROU) were in pretty funky condition. Also, the story has no coherence and structure whatsoever. Everything is thrown around carelessly, especially music from ULTRAMAN and ULTRA SEVEN, which make up the majority of the film&apos;s underscore. (The Japanese version of this film had a new theme song sung by Isao Sasaki and the Columbia Cradle Club; It&apos;s one of the other good things about this film.)\n\nJapan&apos;s Tsuburaya Productions, the creators of Ultraman, co-produced this film with the now-infamous Chaiyo Productions in Thailand, which not only co-produced another film the same year (JUMBORG ACE &amp; GIANT), but its founder/president Sompote &quot;Sands&quot; Saengduenchai would later try to basically steal the Ultraman copyright from Tsuburaya Productions using a forged document supposedly by Eiji Tsuburaya&apos;s late second son Noboru Tsuburaya (who produced this film), resulting in a bitter ongoing court battle since 1996. As of this writing, up to early 2004, Tsuburaya has won all court appeals but one (Chaiyo won merchandising rights outside Japan to the first 6 shows, ULTRA Q through TAROU, and JUMBORG ACE), and contrary to false news reports in the English-language Thai media, Tsuburaya continues to take legal action against Chaiyo.\n\nBut if this is how Chaiyo wants to make Ultraman movies and shows, then it will be a nightmare for Ultra-fans. (And if you thought this movie was bad, the promos for their illegal MILLENNIUM ULTRAMAN stage show are even worse!)\n\nUltra-fans, watch this film at your own risk.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been catching up with some Louis Theroux films recently and this film was one which generally seemed less appealing to me. The trailers had made it look an average affair and a lot of the papers of the time seemed to ignore it in the way they didn&apos;t with some of his other films. Theroux&apos;s style is to act as a naïve innocent in order to allow colorful characters relax and just be themselves. Mostly this style works for him when he has a subject he is trying to draw out, but in some cases this simply isn&apos;t enough unless he is just trying to use these colorful characters in the same way as reality television would do. He proposes this is not the case so I go with him on this.\n\nHere he appears to be looking at the issue of animal&apos;s living in captivity in Middle America (the one politicians call &quot;real&quot; America because to say &quot;crazy&quot; would lose them votes) but in many ways his film fails at this. To start with what it does well, Theroux does get his colorful subjects and he does get some nuggets from them in terms of blissful ignorance. We have all types of crazy here – happily mostly well-meaning but still very odd people. We start with what appears to be a semi-proper park, move through a guy who I will probably next see in a sad news story about his death and ultimately end with a woman who speaks of the love of her caged chimps but is very, very nervous around them – probably since one of them famously took someone&apos;s face off in a vicious attack. The film allows us to see these colorful people and their animals while Theroux talks to them. Although he asks the obvious questions, he never seems to be doing it to get an answer so much as he does to get a reaction. In some cases he gets some great unintentionally funny lines back, in others he gets annoyance. However he never convinces that he is interested in the animals and the answers to the questions he asks.\n\nI saw this because, although we hear about a PETA film, we never push the subjects on this issue, nor does the film give any time at all to any other viewpoint. This lack of a real journey highlights that we are in &quot;Weird Weekends freak showery&quot; territory. This territory has a place and can be good – but it works best when it is presented for what it is, not dressed up in a disingenuous documentary goal. Theroux concludes the documentary with a thoughtful question about &quot;on one hand this, but on the other that&quot; but this annoyed me as the film could so easily have presented the other side – even briefly – but instead it focuses on the characters. To be fair, for once Theroux&apos;s &quot;nervous innocent&quot; act really does come off as genuine and I did enjoy seeing how (rightly) nervous he was around a lot of these animals.\n\nStay for the characters and Theroux in good form, but just put out of your mind any idea that this is a documentary on the subject, or that it really wants to examine the questions that it asks – it doesn&apos;t, but it is still quite enjoyable as a character parade."

      "reviewBody": "Many modern slasher flicks are somewhat campy and understandably so as writing a genuinely scary variant of a film type we&apos;ve already seen many times isn&apos;t easy.\n\nThe Lighthouse takes itself seriously so at least deserves credit for trying although the result isn&apos;t anything special. The killer ultimately is another silent, emotionless type, the hero naturally happens to be someone accused of murder who isn&apos;t guilty. \n\nEssentially a ship crashes leaving the criminals and officers to try surviving. Some manage to reach the nearby lighthouse. The only problem is the serial killer Leo Rook has escaped and already killed the lighthouse workers. \n\nActually there are good suspense scenes as certain characters try to avoid the killer. Unfortunately for slasher fans, the kills aren&apos;t terribly creative. At least it has good pacing and thus avoids being boring.",

I saw it at a friend&apos;s birthday party where someone had recommended it as being a good film.\n\nMr Stitch was so boring that I even found the opening credits boring! The rest of the film was no better. The first two thirds of it took place in this enormous white room without walls. The story seemed to drag on an awful lot and took forever to get to the point of the story which it didn&apos;t really appear to have much of.\n\nThe bizarre looking Frankenstein like creation continued to have memories which were left in the body parts that had come from the people who were dug up in order to build this prototype super soldier for the military. It was difficult trying to find a reason to stay awake, but the person who recommended it kept saying &quot;a good bit was coming up soon&quot;. It never did.\n\nI have heard that this film won a Golden Turkey award for the most boring film of all time. An award which is most deserving. The only notable parts of the movie with any entertainment value at all are the observation eyeball and the smoke cloud in the shape of a skull.\n\nWatch it if you suffer from insomnia."

But the people of the town have other plans for Jeremy.\n\nI started watching this movie as one of my &quot;luck of the draw&quot; picks, not expecting much after the never-ending influx of poor crud I get to see all the time. But this film was good, actually good, and most shockingly: it was good because of Fred Durst, the frontman for rap-rock group Limp Bizkit.\n\nDurst plays the town police officer, and does such a fine job of being cordial and friendly in one scene and emotional in another. Who knew he had it in him to be anything besides violent or obnoxious? Not to downplay Sisto&apos;s part, but Durst really stole the show with this one.\n\n&quot;Population 436&quot; offers a blend of paranoia, numerology, isolation, entrapment and a little bit of romance. You won&apos;t get any gore, and you&apos;re not going to see nude vixens running around. But you will get a unique story. Sure, you have to ignore the obvious (like why the town is so isolated in 2006) but that&apos;s not as difficult as you might think because this film makes you want to believe.\n\nJust watch it. Watch what lengths the town will go to in order to keep its population set firmly at 436. Somewhat bizarre, but completely believable.",

      "name": "THE GO-BETWEEN (Joseph Losey, 1970) ***1/2",
      "reviewBody": "Richly-detailed period romantic drama, told more or less from a child&apos;s viewpoint but treated with the maturity one has come to expect from a Losey film (the main plot is interspersed with fragmented clips of the boy as an old man - played by Sir Michael Redgrave - revisiting the aristocratic country estate where the majority of the narrative takes place).\n\nThough the characters are rather swamped by their surroundings (the two leads are particularly subdued) - as captured by the gleaming cinematography of Gerry Fisher and the elegant décor of Carmen Dillon - the film allows for several good performances from a sturdy cast, including Dominic Guard (as the boy Leo who acts as messenger in the impossible love between upper-class Julie Christie and commoner Alan Bates, both of whom he idolizes), Edward Fox (as Christie&apos;s intended, a war-hero), as well as Margaret Leighton and Michael Gough (as her parents); Leighton&apos;s role remains in the background for most of the time but, then, she asserts herself during the last third to bring down the couple&apos;s relationship - with the unwilling assistance of the bewildered Guard. Besides, Michel Legrand contributes an atypically ominous yet haunting score.\n\nThis was the third and last time Losey and screenwriter Harold Pinter worked together, constituting a very fruitful and quite extraordinary collaboration; for about two-thirds of its length, the film finds Losey somewhere near his best - the contemporary subplot where Leo reprises his &apos;services&apos; for an older Christie works less well, in my opinion (and is too sketchily presented anyway), rendering an already deliberately-paced film somewhat overlong! \n\nTHE GO-BETWEEN won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, was nominated for an impressive 12 BAFTA awards (winning 4) but received only 1 Oscar nomination (for Leighton as Best Supporting Actress).",

Over time she finds out more about her husband and Mozambique than she would have imagined in her peaceful European home. Racism, violence, injustice and fatalism make life unbearable... (exploring this &quot;insufferableness&quot; makes it a very Portuguese movie)\n\nBeautifully made for a first time... Margarida Cardoso&apos;s first full length movie has rich characters, marvelous images and draws a profound picture of life in Mozambique during its struggle of in-dependency (seen from a Portuguese perspective).",

Or even better: read the novels this is based on before you watch the movies. While I haven&apos;t read them, you can start off on a totally different level than me.\n\nHaving said that, the two iconic characters and the two iconic actors who portrayed them. Their names were forever bonded together. A blessing and a curse I reckon. But in this case more of a blessing. Because they did break ground. The movies may not have been made in America and for some they may not feel American or western like - but that does not have to be a bad thing necessarily. Quite the opposite is the case I think. It is nice to have a different view on things and be able to enjoy this European production ... just be open minded about it.\n\nReally good actors and an emotional conclusion of things ... one of the best movie trilogies ever made for sure gets its crowning finish ... no pun intended.",

This beautiful story of powerful love is quite the heart-wrenching story of tragedy, and in many ways a more powerful image of what you can endure for love, and what love can endure. If I can say nothing else, I would like to say I&apos;m glad that I was allowed the opportunity to watch it. Ian McKellen as always created a spectacular character. His character, Kennedy, is the physician in the town that the main character Yanko washes up on. Kennedy is thoughtful and well presented. Another example of these magical characters within this story is Miss Swaffer, played by Kathy Bates. Its as if the people playing these character have a real love for the story, making them appear more than just two-dimensional figures, but real living breathing people.",

      "name": "Quick Comparison of both versions - both excellent in their own right",
      "reviewBody": "Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:\n\n-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-\n\nAmerican - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.\n\nSwedish - This is the &quot;good guy&quot; side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn&apos;t look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. \n\n-LISBETH SALANDER-\n\nAmerican - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.\n\nSwedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn&apos;t chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.\n\n-OVERALL- \n\nI liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. \n\nWhile I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. \n\nOn the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she&apos;s been changed into something they don&apos;t like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth&apos;s character weren&apos;t severe enough to put me off.\n\nThe Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn&apos;t for the faint of heart and that&apos;s what I love about it!"

Containing no feel from the original, an obvious bare-bones budget, and thoroughly disappointing actors, Creepshow III (it should not be able to use the name) simply stinks. Fans of the first two should watch this only to fuel their anger or to mock. I rented this from an automated Redbox unit. (Very cool concept by the way) The rental cost only one dollar. I may have overpaid. I realize that studios and other big companies usually own the rights to film names, but some comment by King and Romero denouncing this trash would be very satisfying. Horror fans, beware of this one!",

      "reviewBody": "Voted the worst picture of the year by the students of Harvard and presumably the winner of the Harvard Lampoon award for 1940 if such was given out back in the day, Green Hell is a great example of what some actors will do for a friend.\n\nNote the credits for producer of this film, the name of the gentleman was Harry Eddington. He and another man Frank Vincent were partners in a talent agency and according to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in his memoirs, Eddington had always wanted to be a producer. He was well liked by his clients and the cast members he assembled were from mostly his free lance clients who did a favor for him. He got Frances Marion to write the script and James Whale to direct and sold the whole business to Universal.\n\nOther than some establishing shots the entire thing was done on the sound stage of Universal. It all looks phony, even the King Kong jungle at RKO was better than this. Of course American movie companies were not shooting abroad in tropical climates at this time. Fairbanks remembers that while the sets were all phony, the humidity due to lack of air conditioning wasn&apos;t.\n\nThe story is set in South America at the Amazon headwaters where one of those movie lost cities has been found. Rumors of Inca treasure has brought a motley concoction of adventurers on an expedition headed by archaeologists Alan Hale and ramrodded by Fairbanks. Vincent Price is part of the group, but he&apos;s killed off before a third of the film is done. But when the native porters bring back medicine to help him possibly survive poison arrows, they also bring back his wife, now his widow Joan Bennett.\n\nAnd Joan is dressing pretty chic for jungle travel, she&apos;s got all the guys panting after her. But when those headhunters who killed off Price come back, it&apos;s starting to look more like the Alamo.\n\nGreen Hell is a curious concoction that&apos;s part Trader Horn, part Rain, a little of the Alamo and a little of John Ford&apos;s Lost Patrol. Vincent Price as well as Fairbanks used to cheerfully make fun of this film. \n\nWhat some people won&apos;t do for a friend.",

      "reviewBody": "It boggles the mind that anyone could possibly defend this movie as some sort of lost classic or claim that people only say it&apos;s bad because it was on &quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot;. When *two* lengthy scenes in a movie consist largely of footage borrowed from better movies, and when both of those scenes could be removed without anyone noticing the break, you know that the director&apos;s aim was to exert himself as little as possible to get the required length of film in the can. Anyone here with a burning zeal to uphold the reputation of THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU against its boorish detractors is almost certainly exerting more effort on the movie&apos;s behalf than Jess Franco ever did.\n\nNevertheless, the film is not among the all-time worst. Roger Ebert is correct when he says, &quot;There&apos;s probably a level of competence beneath which bad directors cannot fall....they&apos;ve got to come up with something that can at least be advertised as a motion picture, released and forgotten.&quot; It can be safely conjectured that this was just what Jess Franco wanted. The dialogue is passable, the acting (what little is needed) is serviceable, and occasionally the editing actually drums up something like tension.\n\nSo if no one aspect of THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU is really *that* bad, why is watching the whole film such a chore? A bad movie can be difficult to watch, but an *aggressively* mediocre one can be worse. When Roger Corman cranked out his listless, paint-by-numbers adventures and fantasy movies, at least he had the excuses of working with zero budget, a cast of third-stringers, and shooting schedules permitting him maybe a week&apos;s use of a sound stage. I&apos;m guessing that Franco&apos;s budget was scarcely greater, but he had a decent cast and enough freedom for location shooting in more than one country. Yet he produced a movie as uninspired and perfunctory as Corman did at his worst. What was Franco thinking?\n\nThe plot seems almost to go out of its way to abandon consistency. Fu Manchu kidnaps Prof. Heracles and then his doctor because he needs help to make the magic freezing crystals in quantity (crystals, by the way, which also perform the totally unrelated duty of a knockout gas), but then even though we see Heracles at the end refuse to help Fu Manchu, his refusal doesn&apos;t even slow Fu Manchu down, who initiates his freezing plan without apparent need for Heracles&apos;s assistance. We *had* seen Fu Manchu demanding a ransom earlier one (without bothering to name terms) but any idea of actually collecting on the ransom never comes up. Fortunately for the world Nayland-Smith shows up to foil his plot to freeze the ocean, although Franco can&apos;t be bothered to show us how he foils it. We see him beating up some flunkies and trying to contact London by radio, then suddenly there&apos;s a loud report and soon Fu Manchu is watching helplessly as everything blows up around him. I&apos;m used to villain&apos;s fortresses improbably blowing up because the hero fires one well-placed shot or smashes one control panel, but THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU gives us the only case of a villain&apos;s fortress exploding merely because the hero makes a long-distance phone call.\n\nIt&apos;s not as though Franco didn&apos;t have enough screen time to fill these plot holes. It&apos;s just that he decided to fill that time with lengthy establishing shots, walking, and creeping around dark corridors and tunnels. He also directs his actors to speak as slowly as possible and pause whenever possible. They have excuses, I suppose. Fu Manchu is &quot;inscrutable&quot;, being an offensive Oriental stereotype, and Omar Pasha is probably stoned out of his mind on opium half the time. The police chief in Istanbul simply doesn&apos;t care and spends a good deal of his screen time sulking and telling people not to bother him. And why should he bother doing his job? He&apos;s played by Jess Franco, after all.\n\nWith so little actually happening in THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU, we have to be content with watching the scenery. There are some beautiful background shots in the film, to be sure. Mostly, though, Franco traps us in Fu Manchu&apos;s lair. The quarter-hours slip by as the &quot;action&quot; takes us from one room or chamber to another and another, none of them very well lit, while Christopher Lee sits and looks smug, or stands up and looks smug, or even speaks while looking smug. Eventually a lot of people die and Fu Manchu disappears into the billowing fake smoke. Dry ice, Rosco fog, and blood, indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "The Frighteners is a textbook example of how to do a horror/comedy. Peter Jackson once again proves he can handle the genre masterfully. With Psychic Investigator Frank Bannister, Michael J. Fox adds another great character to his pantheon of heroes. The rest of the cast is top notch as well. Horror icon Dee Wallace Stone is great in this. John Astin is great in this. R. Lee Ermey is great in this. Even Jake Busey is great in this. Everyone is great in this. The actors and actresses do a wonderful job of handling the humor and the scares. But the actor that really shines here is genre veteran Jeffrey Combs. His portrayal of F.B.I. Special Agent Milton Dammers is one of his most memorable in long career of genre roles. Only the best went into this movie: Rick Baker was brought in to handle some of the visual effects and Danny Elfman composed the score. I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s my favorite, but this may be Jackson&apos;s best horror offering thus far in his career. That&apos;s a bold statement considering he&apos;s no stranger to horror.\n\nNote for genre buffs: Peter Jackson cameos as the pierced passerby."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a Shyamalan fan. He&apos;s not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It&apos;s that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it&apos;s twice in a row.\n\nIn a nutshell: Beginning in Central Park NYC, people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational, even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it&apos;s not terrorists, but nature itself spreading this virus: yes, it&apos;s nature against men. And nature is winning.\n\nI thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words: he shouldn&apos;t be in anything else than a movie about cops or (ex-)marines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel, who looks like she&apos;s a live-action version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?\n\nThe way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia, how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV, mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it&apos;s nothing major. Because there really isn&apos;t much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park (in hindsight) is telling. I really had my doubts about everything: the acting, the actions taken by the characters, the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act, the movie becomes more and more (non intentional) laughable and silly.\n\nAfter seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive B-movie, in the tradition of Romero etc. If that&apos;s the case, then my original rating of 5 (outta 10) should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage, take a look at Zach Snyder&apos;s Dawn of the Dead (although that&apos;s really a remake.) I don&apos;t like a these talented filmmakers who want to take $100 million budgets, to make movies who look like they&apos;ve been made for $10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre. \n\nThe Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it&apos;s boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way.",

Apart from a few guilty pleasure songs, I don&apos;t really love this band like a lot of the screaming teenagers that the movie shows. Still whether we like them or not, there&apos;s no denying they&apos;re huge right now. Now if this success is to continue, that&apos;s another discussion. So I sat back and grooved to some songs I like and learned a little more about them. It wasn&apos;t something I desperately needed to know, but since I was already watching it, I ended up just finding out about this. Now as far as the boys go, I can see that this can be quite overwhelming for them and that they are just normal young people looking for a good time. One Direction has become a very loved, but also hate band. Personally I always separate the music from the individual and as far as I&apos;m concerned, they seem like nice lads. So my advice is if you&apos;re a directioner definitely watch this, and if you&apos;re not, well if you don&apos;t mind them, see it just for the sake of actually seeing them as they are and not the product they&apos;re selling\n\nRating: 4,5/10"

Tom Tyron (&quot;Texas John Slaughter&quot;)is good as the astronaut but French actress Dany Saval (&quot;Boeing, Boeing&quot;) makes the film worth watching.  The support actors fail to bring the script alive (good actors but dry direction lets them sway in the wind).  Tommy Kirk appears in a very small, but adult role."

      "reviewBody": "Instead, I liked it and would gladly watch it again. God Bless America had so much potential. Its first half an hour or so goes as you expect, over the top dark humor with non-stop truth hitting relentless social commentary and then...Roxy walks into the movie. From this point on, unfortunately, without saying much, the movie falls into several paradoxes and loses its focus.\n\nAt its core, GBA is a good social satire with nonstop commentary on the problems with pop culture and society, but on the same coin, the movie tries so hard that it feels like a rant by an angry liberal rather the good satire it initially set out to be. Furthermore, Roxy becomes one of the characters you want dead as the movie goes and her character, along with her and Frank&apos;s relationship, appears so idealized and forced, that it just affects the movie for the rest of its running time. \n\nThe good, however, lies in the great shooting scenes, some of the great commentary made by Frank (most of what Roxy says makes you roll your eyes if not question what in the world the movie was going for), the dark humor, the targets for satire, the over the top story, its entertainment, and overall its a solid 9/10 movie but...\n\nThe bad lies in the second act, on Roxy&apos;s faulty and forced character, its endless rants between our two main character that makes you want them to kill themselves as the next person on their killing spree, the people targeted (whats wrong with high fives and country music? When did this movie become about taste rather than appropriate satire part?) and so on...it just bit itself in the tail.\n\nI really wanted to love this movie. I almost did. Instead every time I went to smile and applaud the commentary, something matter of taste or the character discontinuity got in the way...good movie, definitely one everyone should watch, but sadly, for what it could have been and set out to be, very flawed.",

Han-ki, who doesn&apos;t seem to care too much for others&apos; opinions, decides to kiss her in front of everyone, including the boyfriend. Some soldiers that are passing by reward him with a beating. But the story of Sun-hwa and Han-ki is not over, and when she makes a mistake, Sun-hwa falls into the hands of Han-ki and his group, which will force her into a life of prostitution.\n\nIf you have seen any of Kim Ki-duk&apos;s movies you will already know his love for silences, the problems of communication, the gender relationships (including the more carnal side) in South Korea and other stuff. And &quot;Bad Guy&quot; has a little bit of everything. Sadly, all these interesting observations fall into a plot which suffers from bad pace, little originality and two characters who are little developed (you can see their arc development from moment one). Which is a pity, because the acting is good (even if Han-ki&apos;s constant mutism is overdone). \n\nAs a look into the darkness we all have within ourselves, it is interesting enough. But it cannot overcome its shortcomings, Kim Ki- duk overplaying his cards this time.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s always been a marriage between horror and heavy metal, so it&apos;s surprising that they aren&apos;t many horror films featuring metal as the subject- but Trick or Treat is one of the few, and it is quite enjoyable film about a bullied teen finding solace in METAL, but his obsession can be fatal. With certain bands at the time, such as Judas Priest, accused of putting subliminal messages on their records, this film touches upon that as well.\n\nThe story-Eddie Weinbauer, an &apos;80s metalhead teen who is bullied at school, looks to his heavy metal superstar idol, Sammi Curr, for guidance. When Curr is killed in a hotel fire, Eddie becomes the recipient of the only copy of Curr&apos;s unreleased album, which, when played backwards, brings Sammi back to life. As Halloween approaches, Eddie begins to realize that this isn&apos;t only rock &apos;n roll...it&apos;s life and death.\n\nThe film also stars Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher (!), Gene Simmons as the DJ telling the teen not to take music too seriously - but it&apos;s Marc Price who steals the show as a bullied lone teen.\n\nIt might not be a classic, but it&apos;s a better film than what it&apos;s made out to be. Sure, there&apos;s cheesiness, but that&apos;s part of the appeal. It&apos;s an enjoyable slice of 80&apos;s pie, love the fashion, the big hair, and the soundtrack by Fastway, Only Child, and others, rocks!!",

Then, five members get anonymous invitations to a reunion at a place to which the girls are taken from a central meeting spot by two guys.  Although the duo has been paid only to transport the quintet, the pair is with the girls when the fence around the estate closes, locks and electrifies.  They learn that their captor is the father of the initiation victim, and the remainder of the movie shows how most of them get knocked off -  with a minimum of gore. Although much of the film (especially the first half) is slow-moving, I wasn&apos;t discontent at having spent the time to view it.  In fact, I watched it a second time, thinking that maybe I missed something as far as the ending was concerned. Did somebody believe that THAT was gonna provide the most compact conclusion?

      "reviewBody": "Wildly entertaining western romp with the still athletic Lancaster (as a frontier trapper) and Davis (as runaway slave) reluctantly teamed against a band of bandits led by Savalas. I noticed this pic as good time fun during a TV showing as a kid, way way before the nice DVD version, and still have fond memories of an easygoing adventure. Lancaster is exuberant in this, despite being well into his middle-aged years; he still comes across as someone who can outfight any man and rassle a grizzly bear on the side. He also presents an iconoclastic character here, supremely content onto himself, with not much use for civilization OR anarchy (represented by the barbaric bandits). Just leave him to do his own thing; if you don&apos;t, you&apos;re in for a fight - don&apos;t matter who you are, as Savalas and his band find out.\n\nSavalas is great as the bandit leader, dangerous blow-hard that he is; though not too intelligent, he&apos;s still a lot smarter than the other idiots under his rule (including a bearded Dabney Coleman in an early role). His main squeeze is the cigar-chomping floozy Shelley Winters, hamming it up as much as the otherwise all-male cast. Davis, in an odd contrast, comes across as the most sophisticated of the whole bunch, despite supposedly being a slave his entire life; he also proves to be the most duplicitous; he&apos;s not simply honorable and disappoints Lancaster more than once. Maybe director Pollack was sneaking in some commentary on the outmoded superior standing of the white race by this point, though I think it was wishful thinking that Davis could get away with as much as he does here in the 19th century. In all, the actors prove to be good hams to the very end.",

      "reviewBody": "FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title&apos;s Content and Context: Perhaps the TITLE may sound gruesome... But Let me set the record straight regarding KILLING ROOM&apos;s AUDIO! Many reviewers complain about the sound. &quot;Couldn&apos;t understand!&quot;, &quot;Needed Captions!&quot;, they protest! Believe me, as an amateur expert, everything &quot;Audio&quot; here is exquisite; it just doesn&apos;t get any better! Is the dialog hard to follow? You bet it is! And this is EXACTLY what 32 year-old South African Director Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls/Rings) wanted! Stress/Tension levels tend to go through the roof when you&apos;re under constant duress about having missed something crucial. Don&apos;t worry! I guarantee You won&apos;t!\n\nKILLING ROOM does have similarities to most of the films it&apos;s compared to here. However, IMO it bears, by far, the greatest similitude to Spain&apos;s La HABITACION De FERMAT (FERMAT&apos;s ROOM). FOUR nothing-in-common strangers have responded to a Want Ad for &quot;Test Subjects&quot;.\n\nAnd, From the get-go, they&apos;re told that &quot;They will be given $250 each, for their participation/ co-operation. One by one they will be eliminated from the experiment. However, they ALL will receive $250, irrespective of the order of their elimination!&quot; What someone SHOULD have requested was: &quot;Define ELIMINATION&quot;!\n\nSurprisingly well done ensemble acting, with Timothy Hutton, Chloe Sevigny and Peter Storemare the most noteworthy examples. If KILLING ROOM had not lost its iron grip on me for a few minutes about 3/4 through, I would have rewarded it with 10*...A real shame, that! Part Psychological Drama/Suspense, part Mystery/Thriller, part Dark Morality Play, and the fourth component is what makes KILLING ROOM totally unique, makes it stand out head and shoulders above the pack! Unfortunately, the simple act of revealing it would serve as a definite SPOILER!... So you&apos;ll just have to see KILLING ROOM for yourselves, won&apos;t you? 8*STARS*\n\n..... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en ESPAÑOL, are most welcome!",

In the meantime, intertwining with clips from his films and showing the artists&apos; paintings, two narrators try to reach a consensus about who tells best the biography of the man in question. He probably didn&apos;t succeed all that much not because of a tragical event in his life but merely because (from the perspective we gather here) his paintings were simplistic and lifeless. OK, that wasn&apos;t fair since I saw the portraits through camera lens rather than in front of me but whatever. And there&apos;s pointless discussions about history, art and life. I say pointless because the lack of coherence in this film is shocking to the point of mix things that make sense with things that are half explained. Watchable, relatively good but passable. 6/10",

As she is forbidden to hang out with her former dance crew called 718, she finds a new dance crew (HD) and battles with 718 on the Battle Zone. The plot is as predictable and clichéd as can be, but it doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is the great dancing. I have to say the epic showdown is quite a disappointment, possibly because HD crew were wearing black and hence they do not stand out from the background. And maybe the choreography is not as epic and stunning as it should be. Anyway, &quot;Honey 2&quot; is still adequate entertainment to spend a relaxing evening in."

The sound quality is poor at best with much wind noise and bass rumble on the microphones. Then again it is deliberate and perfectly fits the intended tone. This is probably the cleverest use of budget. There is no budget and they make a quite well crafted horror out of it. You get the feeling that they are really passionate about making films. There is some repetition as they struggled slightly to fill the time but overall it is interesting throughout. There are some really creepy moments that they could have taken further. I didn&apos;t like the third person ending; they could have kept it part of the documentary. It is inspirational for those wanting to make movies with a bit of substance with no money. Add some more thrills and this would have been much bigger. Obvious deliberate technical deficiencies are made up for by passion and suspense.",

The story line may seem a bit similar to other movies such as A simple plan, Shallow Grave and Fargo but there was enough originality to keep you interested. The Chemistry between Robin Williams and Giovanni Ribisi really works and you can tell the director gave them a chance to flow and add lib their scenes together. Some of the visuals out in the snow and mountains are stunning too. *** Rent it, you wont be disappointed.",

Also the concept of making art from garbage and involving the garbage pickers who work at the dumpsite got me curious. What I got from this film in the end was far more than what I expected. The camera follows Muniz to the world&apos;s largest waste land in Rio de Janeiro. One by one the viewer is introduced to some of the people who work there while Muniz proposes his project to them. The people, who are considered by many, to be of the lowest of classes, are portrayed beautifully as high spirited people, in this film. Just like any other common working human being, the pickers work hard to provide for their families and many of them are quite proud of what they do . There is also a wonderful sense of unity. What Muniz offers them is to be a part of something big, to dream again. It&apos;s a sight to behold, when the workers&apos; faces light up as they realize they are becoming/ have become a part of something unique, beautiful and important. These are three adjectives that I&apos;d additionally use to describe this inspiring, insightful and unique gem."

It pulls you in from the start and keeps you invested the entire time not wanting to take your eyes off the screen. This script and story could have gone in any direction but the way the movie captures the emotions of the story and how relatable and real the characters feel, I would say the overall presentation is exceptinally well done.\n\nReccomended to watch!",

      "name": "Sometimes you just need a stupid film like this to make you laugh",
      "reviewBody": "Although I love a good foreign or independent film, sometimes I am in the mood for a good old stupid film like THE WATERBOY. This is not meant as an insult, as the makers of this film intended for it to be very dumb and in the process the film is also quite entertaining. There are many times I could just use some mindless fun and I am thankful that films like the Bill and Ted films, UHF, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and THE WATERBOY are there when I am in the mood for goofiness.\n\nAdam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher--a guy so socially inept people assume he is an idiot. His sole desire in life when he film begins is to be a water boy for a football team--even though he&apos;s in his 30s! When he shows up at South Central Louisiana State University looking for this job, the coach (Henry Winkler) lets him do it---provided he doesn&apos;t have to pay Boucher! Oddly, Boucher looks at his job as if it were a science and he takes amazing pride in such a menial and worthless job. In the process, he looks like a total geek and the players make fun of him constantly. Eventually, all the needling reminds him of all the many, many, many times others have made fun of him over the years and he reacts by knocking one of the players off his feet. Not realizing it, Boucher was able to channel his 31 years of rage into tackling. Winkler realizes Boucher&apos;s potential and gets him to agree to play football--even though Boucher&apos;s mama (Kathy Bates) thinks &quot;foosball is of the Devil!&quot;. This is accomplished by pretending that he&apos;s just the team&apos;s water boy. I loved when he came home bruised up after a game and explained that it was because he was beaten up by an escaped gorilla....and she believed it!! However, when Mama finally learns the truth, she slips into an unknown illness and Waterboy is unable to bring himself to play in the super-important Bourbon Bowl!\n\nThe film abounds with stupid moments--the sort that make kids laugh and adult often pretend aren&apos;t funny. I believe that most sophisticated adults WILL like the film but should probably only watch it when the kids are asleep--otherwise the children will realize that their parents are capable of laughing at Adam Sandler.\n\nClever writing, lots of silly gags (such as his run-in with &apos;Colonel Sanders&apos;) and a part that works well for Sandler, this is one of his better films. I also recommend you try watching THE WEDDING SINGER. And, because I care about you, I advise you to avoid LITTLE NICKY like the plague, as its juvenile humor is something only the most seriously brain damaged can appreciate. It&apos;s just not funny.\n\nBy the way, the plot of THE WATERBOY is in many ways a variation on Stephen King&apos;s CARRIE. Carrie&apos;s mother IS Bobby Boucher&apos;s mother in many different ways. And, instead of cool telekinesis, Bobby&apos;s &quot;magic power&quot; is his ability to tackle. Think about it.",

      "reviewBody": "1976 was probably a crucial year in gauging the status of the Western as a feasible Hollywood film genre: apart from well-regarded titles like THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES and THE RETURN OF A MAN CALLED HORSE, you had to contend with some notorious flops, of both the art-house  Robert Altman&apos;s BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS OR, SITTING BULL&apos;S HISTORY LESSON and Arthur Penn&apos;s THE MISSOURII BREAKS  and the spoof  THE DUCHESS AND THE DIRTWATER FOX and THE GREAT SCOUT AND CATHOUSE THURSDAY (which I&apos;ve yet to catch up with)  variety. The star rating I gave to the film in question is an indication that it wasn&apos;t, in fact, as disastrous as contemporary (and even more recent, in view of its release on DVD) reviews would have you believe and I&apos;d say it&apos;s even worthy of earning a place in my collectionwhich should, of course, imply that it has rewatchability value.\n\nGoldie Hawn, George Segal and his amiably clumsy horse Blackjack are practically the whole show here and this is clearly one of those movies which rely heavily on the charisma (or lack thereof) of its leads for its success or otherwise. The screenplay does have some good lines  including an amusingly protracted stagecoach conversation (supposedly in French) between the two stars which actually incorporates slangy English, French, Italian, Spanish and some Latin, too  but the plot is rather too thin to sustain the film&apos;s length. Hawn is a saloon entertainer/hooker with ideas above her station: she gets to wear tarty outfits, sing a bawdy song in an English accent and board the aforementioned stagecoach to become &quot;The Duchess&quot; of the title, an English governess to a host of kids borne by a wealthy Mormon; on the other hand, Segal is a luckless womanizing cardsharp who keeps getting caught cheating and finding himself at the wrong end of the noose; he eventually manages to abscond with $40,000 in stolen loot to the eternal chagrin of a ramshackle band of outlaws. The bag containing the money changes owners more often than these characters take a bath and, along the way, Hawn and Segal finally make love aboard a canoe approaching some deadly rapids, take refuge in a Jewish wedding ceremony and are bound together and left to roast under the baking desert sun. The change in mood towards the end  where Segal is repeatedly shot in the final confrontation with the gang  is far from smoothly handled but the open-ended conclusion nevertheless manages to end the film on a lighter note.",

It starts off with the soldiers being recruited from death row (a la Dirty Dozen). They then run them through a series of obstacles, but the real obstacles are the ones in their hearts and minds. Now I tried to power through one of these films before &quot;JSA&quot;, it gets all muddled down in political and societal dialog. Now &quot;OLDBOY, I COME WITH THE RAIN&quot; I my favorite movies (behind &quot;THE PRINCESS BRIDE&quot; of course). But I don&apos;t understand Korean society or politics, all I know there is no witty repertoire or a since of comedy. Nor is there any on my sign unleash hell, or _You NEED me on that WALL, you WANT me on that WALL!&quot; Just reading the subtitles my eyes roll to the back of my head and the next thing I know the soldiers is in a running gun-battle with the trainers."

What this film lacks in blood it makes up in depth of characterisation and story layers - the old lady&apos;s suicide pact with her dead husband, the psycopathic nanny, the insensitive businessman etc. etc. It&apos;ll keep you guessing until the end. It&apos;s been a week now since I saw this movie and I can&apos;t stop talking about it.

      "reviewBody": "This movie lacks the charm and the warmth of the original stories by Guareschi.  Transporting the context 30 years forward into present-day (that is: 1980s) Italy was probably the right thing to do, since the distance in time wasn&apos;t big enough to film this as a period piece, but turning Don Camillo into such a cool dude rips the heart out of these stories. Mario Girotti plays the character in Trinity style, aloof, quirky, dead-pan; but this Camillo is barely recognisable as the passionately caring priest of the books. I don&apos;t think the earlier Camillo incarnation by Fernandel was right either (e.g. Fernandel&apos;s Camillo was not physical enough), but at least it exuded the required warmth. \n\nA cool Don Camillo creates another problem: what happens with his constant little battles with Peppone and his party? Peppone&apos;s communist shenanigans are similarly toned down and as a result the antagonism between the two sides does not ring true - at least not to the extent the stories require. Thus, this film version also lacks the tension, conflict and hatred between the two camps. Perhaps there was some sensitivity here towards the American market: no children&apos;s movies with real communists in them, please!\n\nA few changes to cater for the international market are also embarrassing: the two soccer teams are called &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Devils&quot; (in English!) and a couple of the songs performed in Church are in English as well. This is situated in rural Italy!",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s funny to call &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; a followup to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. This film is a prequel to the 1981 smash hit, a movie where the events that take place actually took place before the events in &quot;Raiders&quot;. Notice at the beginning of &quot;Raiders&quot; that the year is 1936. In &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;, the year is 1935. See what I mean? &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singer/entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and little Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). On their way to finding the stone they stumble across a palace that leads to the gateway of the Temple of Doom run by an evil Thugee cult. The action and special effects are first-rate as you would expect, though the story is a tad weaker than it was in &quot;Raiders&quot;. Plus, Capshaw&apos;s performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far over-the-top in some scenes that you&apos;d wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless, Capshaw isn&apos;t all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she&apos;s not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan (now known as Jonathan Ke Quan) comes off better as Indy&apos;s young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed &quot;The Goonies&quot;, but then didn&apos;t appear in much after that. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; is great fun only if you can get by Kate Capshaw&apos;s simpering wimpering character or the over-the-top violence. I found it to be exciting from beginning to end.\n\n***1/2 (out of four)\n\nPOINT OF INTEREST: this was the film that lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating in 1984 (along with Spielberg&apos;s other 1984 movie &quot;Gremlins&quot;). Both &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot; feature violence that most people felt was too strong for a PG rating, though the MPAA felt that it wasn&apos;t strong enough to merit an R rating (other Spielberg movies that got PG ratings that were quite intense were &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, and the original &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;). So after &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot; opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year&apos;s biggest hits, the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG-13 rating was born. In August 1984, the first movies were released with the new PG-13 rating (&quot;Red Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;). It&apos;s not a new rating anymore. The PG-13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it&apos;ll still go strong in the years to come. But I&apos;ll always remember &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; as the leading factor to the creation of the PG-13 rating.",

      "reviewBody": "Hundreds of sports films, hundreds of them. Pretty sure Hollywood has tackled every type of sport, including Baseball several times over. Why should this one be any different? Well, this is the true story of the Oakland Athletics to which their General Manager at the time used a new technique of deciding a team: the Moneyball model. Using statistics and logic to pick the most effective players at the cheapest price, therefore building the ultimate economical team. Such a model could change the Baseball industry and negate years of traditional intuition. This is not so much about changing Baseball, but a personal journey for Billy Beane. He himself was chosen to play professionally, ditching his chances of further education. It didn&apos;t work out, and so he desired to change the system and defy the industry as a personal vendetta against them. Completely unconventional, having a computer system pick the most suitable players as opposed to listening to veterans who have something that algorithms do not: experience. Thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can say I have no interest in Baseball (not particularly huge in the UK). A screenplay by Aaron Sorkin was destined to keep me captivated. Every script he writes is filled with sharp, concise dialogue that keeps you hooked on the characters. Brad Pitt looked effortlessly natural, owned every scene he was in. Jonah Hill...get ready guys...I actually liked. Finally!? A film I like him in. Cool, calm and calculated, was perfect at playing a graduate economist. Bennett Miller&apos;s direction was clean with a great mixture of old footage of Baseball games with the reconstructed acting. There&apos;s a scene towards the end where the result of a game relies on Chris Pratt hitting the ball. When he does...silence. I felt the tingles, was beautifully executed. Whilst the sport of Baseball does not interest me in the slightest, I loved the focus on the team building and thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone.",

The story is told via flashback, through voice over by the daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), who wants to attend a prestigious university.\n\nAs one might expect, there is a culture clash between Flor and the white family that employs her services for household help--especially as personified by Deborah (Tea Leoni), the mother. It should be noted that Leoni and the entire cast give fantastic performances, even if some of the portrayals are written as caricatures. Adam Sandler, who plays the father, John, is particularly fun to watch, because he mostly plays his character straight, without his usual comedic embellishments. I was most impressed by Sarah Steele, who plays the teenage daughter of Leoni and Sandler.\n\nMuch of the story is intended to be comedy, though it deals with social issues that go well beyond the disconnect caused by the fact that the two mothers do not speak a common language. The film has a definite perspective about the various cultural issues it addresses, but it is only partially convincing in its arguments.\n\nI found the film to be disjointed, but that did not bother me. There is so much to appreciate in the story of the two families.",

I liked also the magazines of  `Mandrake&apos;, `Superman&apos;, `Batman&apos;, `Tarzan&apos; and `Zorro&apos; (in this sequence), but I would not dare to compare any of them with `The Phantom&apos;. For my surprise, the Brazilian distributor `Classicline&apos; released an unknown (at least for me) 1943 version of a serial of `The Phantom&apos;, in a double DVD without any extra. The story is composed by fifteen episodes as follows:\n\n1) The Sign of the Skull (`O Sinal da Caveira&apos;);\n\n2) The Man Who Never Dies (`O Homem Que Nunca Morrre&apos;);\n\n3) A Traitor&apos;s Code (`Um Código de Traidor&apos;);\n\n4) The Seat of Judgement (`O Banco de Julgamento&apos;);\n\n5) The Ghost Who Walks (`O Fantasma Que Anda&apos;);\n\n6) Jungle Whispers (`Sussuros da Selva&apos;);\n\n7) The Mystery Well (`O Poço do Mistério);\n\n8) In the Quest of the Keys (`Em Busca das Chaves&apos;);\n\n9) The Fire Princess (`A Princesa do Fogo&apos;);\n\n10) The Chamber of Death (`A Câmara de Morte&apos;);\n\n11) The Emerald Key (`A Chave de Esmeralda&apos;);\n\n12) The Fangs of the Beast (`As Presas da Fera&apos;);\n\n13) The Road to Zoloz (`O Caminho Para Zoloz&apos;);\n\n14) The Lost City (`A Cidade Perdida&apos;); and,\n\n15) Peace in the Jungle (`Paz na Selva&apos;).\n\n The plot begins with the death of the `old&apos; Phantom and his son (Tom Tyler) assuming his spot with his dog Devil (Capeto, in Portuguese). Meanwhile, there are two expeditions trying to reach the lost city of Zoloz: the good one leaded by Professor Davidson (Frank Shannon), with his daughter Diana Palmer (Jeanne Bates) in the team, having the intention of archeological research for an university in Melville. The evil one leaded by the diabolic Dr. Max Bremmer (Kenneth MacDonald), who is serving a foreign country, and having the intention of building a hidden airport. The foreign nation is not specified in the story, but in 1943, there were the World War II in Europe, therefore it is not difficult to guess which power Dr. Max Bremmer was serving. For reaching his intent and find the city of Zoloz, Prof. Davidson has a partial map composed of six ivory pieces, needing the last one to complete the track. The story follows the pattern of action movies of those romantic times: the hero never bleeds; the villains use the most complicated ways and tricks to get rid off the hero; in the end of each chapter, there is a missing scene, where the hero escapes from a dangerous situation (explosions, gas, avalanche of stones, fire, water, shot etc.); the heroin always screams when in danger; when a porter dies, nobody cares. Further, it is politically incorrect in the present days, having an animal hunter as Phantom&apos;s best friend. This naive type of story may be silly in the present days for the younger generations (and indeed it is), but it brings parts of my childhood back to my mind, and consequently I love it. The athletic actor Tom Tyler is in an excellent shape. I have no idea whether stunts were much used in 1943. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `O Fantasma&apos; (`The Phantom&apos;)",

To watch him in The Lady Vanishes, then to see him in this, it really is a testament to his acting versatility.\n\nThe story itself is utterly depressing, and shows little remorse. Though this is why the film is so brilliant. The atmosphere mixes that of the school and that of the Greek tragedy - namely Aeschylus&apos; the Agamemnon. Coker-Harris is slowly broken down by his wife, which is similar to that of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. However, Coker-Harris has not done much wrong to warrant this hate and spite, which makes him a sympathetic and tragic character.\n\nThe film moves at a brisk pace and is not once boring. The acting is superb, the look efficient and makes for a superb film.",

But he&apos;s lost his muse and literally has to move back to his family&apos;s ancestral home in Connecticut where the rent is free.\n\nWhile there he gets involved with some Polish immigrants who have bought a lot of acreage in the Nutmeg state for tobacco growing and farmer Jean Hersholt wants some of Cooper&apos;s land. Needing the cash, Cooper agrees. He finds the people there fascinating in an sociological sort of way. And he finds Hersholt&apos;s daughter Anna Sten far more intriguing.\n\nThe Wedding Night was supposed to be the launching of a new Sam Goldwyn discovery in Anna Sten. But for some reason she didn&apos;t catch on with the public though she does give a fine performance. There&apos;s a lengthy list of speculative reasons why she never caught on, some have been mentioned by other reviewers.\n\nHowever the best performance in the film is Helen Vinson as Cooper&apos;s wife. She starts off giving the impression she&apos;s a flighty airhead, but actually that&apos;s not the case. Vinson usually was playing the other woman in her film career, here she reverses type as the wronged wife. You do feel sorry for her, she&apos;s done nothing to deserve Cooper&apos;s infidelity.\n\nFor those who are curious about Anna Sten as she&apos;s become something of a symbol as to how not to showcase a talent, The Wedding Night might be worth a look.",

In fact, for some time, you are really baffled by what is going on. Ajay is telling a story, and from the way the story is visualized, you have a lot of reason to assume he is telling his own story, even though he doesn&apos;t present it that way. Until you get through most of the way into the story, you have no choice but to follow the story as if it is a parable or something.\n\nThen comes the big crunch, the rainy scene where the whole mood completely changes. But still the story-teller keeps his hole card out of sight.\n\nWhen the true nature of what is going on becomes evident, you realize the story is one of the most frightening anyone can imagine, and only then do you really appreciate the quality of the acting.\n\nSo, I think I&apos;ve seen Ajay Devgan&apos;s best movies. And I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve seen Kajol at her best. And I&apos;ve liked every movie since their marriage, whether comical or serious, where they played the lead roles. But I&apos;m pretty convinced this is, at least, Ajay&apos;s best. And somewhere near Kajol&apos;s best. I hope one or both gets at least a nomination in next year&apos;s award round.",

I guess this movie was an inspiration for a Tamil (Indian) movie &apos;Pasanga&apos; which did win a national award for the country.\n\nPredominant cast in this movie are kids. Initially I didn&apos;t expect much acting from kids but was wrong. They acted professionally, IMHO. Apart from screenplay and script the camera work was well done too. Again another Korean movie got me touchy/sentimental and music was good. The bottom line : A must watch movie for all ages.",

It was made in 1959, and it dealt with decapitation and shrunken heads. Although it didn&apos;t actually show the decapitation, it did show the skin being removed from a decapitated skull. By today&apos;s horror standards it was pretty mild (this picture was filmed in glorious black and white so you don&apos;t get the blood red effect of today&apos;s films) but nonetheless, it was pretty gory for it&apos;s day.\n\nThe story revolves around Jonathan Drake (portayed by Eduard Franz), the remaining male survivor of his family. His family has been cursed since his grandfather&apos;s time by a tribe of Amazon indians that were slaughtered by his grandfather and several other men.\n\nHenry Daniell is just great as the creepy Dr. Zurich. There are several other strong supporting performances by Grant Richards as the stalwart Detective Jeff Rowan and Paul Cavanaugh as Kenneth Drake, Jonathan Drake&apos;s brother, who unfortunately loses his head to fulfill the &quot;Drake Curse&quot;.\n\nI did laugh a few times during the movie...Paul Wexler portrays Xutai, one of the Amazon indians, and he has to be seen to be believed. Even with his mouth sewn shut he looked more funny to me than menacing. Also you can tell that this movie was filmed on a very low budget. The sets are pretty substandard.\n\nDespite these minor flaws I found this movie to be highly entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "The story line in this film is basically fictional, but real names of people who lived in Tucson, Arizona Territory, in the late nineteenth century are given to members of the cast, and the set that was created specifically for its production still exists just over the hill from the real Tucson of today.  As someone who remembers visiting that set during filming in 1940, I am still impressed by the place and by this film.  Jean Arthur&apos;s character was indeed a prototype of the independent frontierswoman . But even more important from the perspective of today as I stand among the remnants of the old set (still used, together with a sound stage on the property, to produce &quot;Westerns&quot;) and look back sixty years just as the producers looked back sixty years for their story, I think of it as a story within a story. Anyone visiting Arizona today would do well to think of the film &quot;Arizona&quot; as a true picture of 1880 and, in another context, of 1940, and let their imaginations wander. The social attitudes and mores of both periods stand in great contrast to those of the 21st century."

      "reviewBody": "This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you&apos;ve seen. However this comes from the fact that you can&apos;t make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don&apos;t want to feel slighted you&apos;ll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they&apos;ve all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you&apos;ll lose pity for them just like you&apos;ve already done for the film. I can&apos;t go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.\n\nTo start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you&apos;ve never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type. \n\nAll in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.",

It&apos;s a famous story sang by Rimi Natsukawa and music written by BEGIN.\n\nI would hope that who ever wrote this description correct the cast. Shingaki is the pronunciation in Japanese for the Kanji. &quot;Arakaki&quot; is the correct pronunciation for the same Kanji in Okinawan. In the Japanese language track of the DVD movie you&apos;ll find them say it correctly. ^^\n\nIt is a simple Japanese/Okinawan mix up in language differences.

The cast suggested quality - Madeline Stowe as the estranged mother, Bijou Phillips as the kidnapped daughter and John Rhys-Myers as the cult leader. So what happened?\n\nAs ever the script was mishandled or badly developed. The protagonists, mother and daughter are decidedly unlikeable and the POV of the narrative makes the mistake of switching sides half way through. As with George Sluizer&apos;s The Vanishing, the story should have stayed with the protagonists search for her missing loved one,  but instead it focuses on the tearaway daughter and her frolics with a laughable cult of blood drinking travellers. What narrative there is soon disintergrates into a pop video and attempts to salvage the film with a third act  denoument in a factory treads into Ed Wood territory.\n\nSo much for the much trumpeted Random Harvest/Four Horsemen british horror slate. Heads should roll for this one."

There were nice little surprises in this movie and I don&apos;t know if this is based on actual story lines in the marvel comics. It is nice to see a mature approach of things,just like in the comics. For me &quot;UM2&quot; is an example of what can be achieved if they take the myths created by Marvel Comics seriously!. I can&apos;t get enough of this! Bring it on,make more of these kind of movies! Although Bruce Banner also starred in this movie,the Hulk didn&apos;t appear very long. Too bad,because it is always nice to see Hulk smash things. Next time more Hulk, or even an animated movie of Hulk!",

      "reviewBody": "With this third installment in the &quot;Ong Bak&quot; franchise, Tony Jaa has finally given closure and clarity to &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, an in-name only sequel to the original and much superior first chapter. That sequel, which was in fact a prequel set in 15th century Thailand compared to its contemporary predecessor, saw Tony Jaa as the orphaned son Tien of a noble family whose parents were killed by the power-hungry Lord Rajasena. Brought up by a group of warriors, Tien grows up to become a fearsome fighting machine himself- which is really an excuse for Tony Jaa to show off his bone-crunching moves.\n\n&quot;Ong Bak 2&quot; ended on a cliffhanger, with Tien overwhelmed by the sheer number of Rajasena?s soldiers and taken away to be tortured to death. Then came the enigmatic voice-over suggesting that Tien may find a way to cheat death once again and the final shot of him standing in front of a scarred Golden Buddha statue. Picking right up after the events of &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, this installment begins with an unpleasant sequence where Tien is beaten and brutalized in ways apparently too disconcerting even for an NC16 rating (yes, it&apos;s cut). His bones completely broken, Tien is saved from execution by a palace order- though it?s not explained why- and subsequently nursed to health by a group of villagers.\n\nThere he begins a journey of meditation- one of both physical and spiritual healing- that draws heavily on Buddhist teachings of forgiveness versus revenge, aided by his mentor Phra Bua (played by veteran Thai actor Nirut Sirijanya) and his childhood sweetheart Pim (played by Primrata Det-Udom). Meanwhile, Rajasena is haunted by a curse set upon him by the Crow Demon (Dan Chupong), the mysterious agile fighter whom Tien had fought with briefly in &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, who wants the throne for himself. His body covered with tattoos, the Crow Demon soon uses his supernatural powers to enslave the villagers, setting the stage for an epic confrontation with Tien.\n\nTrue enough, like &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, audiences will be treated to a no-holds-barred vicious climax with plenty of jaw-breaking, head-cracking and knee-crunching action. Like its predecessor too, Tony Jaa will go up against dozens of enemy warriors in the midst of an elephant herd. And once again, like its predecessor, you can be sure that you&apos;ll be left in awe at Tony Jaa&apos;s physical agility and martial arts prowess- which was the very reason his name was mentioned among the greats Jet Li and Jackie Chan when &quot;Ong Bak&quot; was first released.\n\nHere, Tony Jaa also showcases the &apos;nattayuth&apos; fighting technique, a combination of traditional khon dancing with mixed martial arts, as his character Tien goes up against the Crow Demon. That showdown is simply poetry in motion- Jaa&apos;s &apos;nattayuth&apos; moves equally graceful and brutal- made even more impressive when one starts to see the parallel between that and the dancing movements Tien had earlier learnt from Pim.\n\nBut credit must also go to his co-star Dan Chupong, who proves his mettle as Jaa?s equal in not just the climax but in almost every fight sequence that he appears in. In fact, while Tien is off meditating, Dan Chupong gets to steal the show in a thrilling fight against Rajasena&apos;s men as his Crow Demon character goes about smashing their skulls through thick brick walls. (There is certainly a real-life parallel to be drawn here, as Tony Jaa&apos;s decision to join the monkhood in May shortly after this film was released can only mean that Dan Chupong may steal his thunder as Thailand&apos;s most famous action star.) Of course, there is a good reason for Tien&apos;s (or Tony Jaa&apos;s) departure, for &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; tries- though rather clumsily- to be a film about the redemptive potential of forgiveness. Whereas Jaa&apos;s Tien was driven by revenge in &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, here he is driven by something different, something less destructive and ultimately liberating.\n\nIn the hands of more experienced directors, this noble ambition might have translated better to the big screen- but co-directors Tony Jaa and Jaa&apos;s mentor Panna Pittikrai (who are also action choreographers and action directors in the film) are unfortunately out of their league here. And that is where &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; falters, not just for taking itself too seriously, but for doing so too maladroitly. Indeed, it&apos;s especially telling when one of the best things about the film is the levity that Phettai Wongkumlao&apos;s village idiot Mhen brings, especially during Tien&apos;s fight when he first emerges from his self-imposed solitude.\n\nMuch has been said about the production troubles surrounding &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot; and &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot;- Tony Jaa disappearing from the set for two whole months during filming for &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;; subsequent studio pressure leading to the rushed production of &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot; and the decision to make this film &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; partly to complete the story and partly to recoup costs. For all its travails, &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; isn&apos;t the unnecessary three-quel it may seem, bringing a befitting conclusion to the story that Tony Jaa began in &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot; and left off so abruptly. At the very least, it&apos;s an excuse to watch Tony Jaa fight on screen again and probably for the last time in a long while. That alone is worth the price of admission.",

The pleasant music of the De Angelis brothers enriches the good product and the direction and photography are also very accurate.

One of the humanoid aliens develop a special relationship with Dr Evans, whose scientific work aspire to prolong the human life span. As a first encounter both sides experience somewhat of a disappointment about the other, albeit the aliens had less to correct. The emphasis is on the dialog. This is a film with limited action and special effects. The display of a well known scotch whisky, and brand of cigarettes intend to give the viewer the impression the events in this film take place somewhere in western Europe. Being the year 1973, it works for me, though we did have slightly more intense traffic. The performances are classic Russian drama acting, which works just fine in surreal situations such as alien encounters. The star Sergey Bondarchuk does a solid interpretation of his role. Does his name seem familiar? Well, yes, his daughter made a memorable and lasting impression as Hari in Tarkovsky&apos;s Solaris the year before this film. This is not a great movie, but it is neither a complete waste of time to watch it.",

The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won&apos;t go along with the cruelty of society. I&apos;m sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you&apos;ll be dead.\n\nMovie brought to life this great man who really shouldn&apos;t be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he&apos;ll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.\n\nI still think that Oskar Shindler&apos;s last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - &quot;Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.&quot;",

The musical numbers are sensational, and one can detect real admiration on Webb&apos;s face when he watches Lee and Ella perform; accordingly, this was Webb&apos;s labor of love. Watch for Andy Divine in a role unlike any you&apos;ve seen him in before.",

      "reviewBody": "World War I and II have always been a good setting for European cinema as different films have been made by France, Germany and Italy which speak about two major conflicts which have brought mankind close to the brink of disaster. As we discuss the portrayal of wars in cinema, we need to mention that it is the French directors who have portrayed world wars in a comic fashion as opposed to the seriousness which a war film demands. Hence, it is with immense pride can one state that a long time before Italian comedy actor/director Roberto Benigni (Life is beautiful), French cinema was the first national cinema to give comic touches to wars especially in their humorous portrayal of Nazism. For example : PAPY FAIT DE LA RESISTANCE directed by Jean-Marie Poiré. Ace of aces is one such film which recreates the magic of comedy during a war by lampooning Nazi soldiers and their leader Adolf Hitler who were in power in Germany during 11th Summer Olympic Games which were held in 1936 in Berlin. For this film, French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo is paired with Marie-France Pisier who get rid of their differences in order to help a Jewish family. It is not only the star cast which has worked wonders for this film as Gérard Oury has added too many popular cinema elements to make his film a nice viewing experience for all types of viewers regardless of their age or taste. One gets to see an incredible chase of airplanes in the skies, a French boxing team, a bear in a car chased by Nazi soldiers, Der Fuehrer &apos;Adolf Hitler&apos; and his sister and even a short documentary footage of American sprinter Jesse Owens. You would not hesitate in watching this film as it represents a true example of light comedy in cinema if you have already enjoyed and seen &apos;La Grande Vadrouille&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah, Gulzar! The poet and the filmmaker, above all, an artiste in the truest sense. What sets &apos;Namkeen&apos; apart from his other works is that this one has a more Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Shyam Benegal feel to it rather than the Gulzar signature. It is one of his lesser known films. &apos;Namkeen&apos; too is a story of unfulfilled love (like &apos;Ijaazat&apos;, &apos;Aandhi&apos; and &apos;Mausam&apos;) but here the story is given a more slice of life treatment, a glimpse into the characters&apos; life, rather than having it &apos;follow a plot&apos;.\n\n&apos;Namkeen&apos; has a lyrical feel to it (a common factor in Gulzar&apos;s movies) and the landscape (I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s in Darjeeling) is breathtaking. The characters are easy to relate to and endearing. There are only about two or three songs but they are beautifully visualized and the lyrics are mesmerizing.\n\nGulzar beautifully displays Jyoti and her three daughters&apos; struggle to get by every day. These are poor people and their daily concern is winning bread and other necessary requirements such as oil. They don&apos;t have time to fall in love but that doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t have dreams. A voiceless Mitthu expresses her words in poetry while the youngest Chimki is a vivacious spirit. Nimki is the eldest one who keeps the family together as she takes care of all the household activities and makes sure that all the requirements are met while the hardworking mother, Jyoti, is at work all day. Gerulal brings a pleasant change to their lives.\n\nSanjeev Kumar, once again, plays a part only he could do justice to. Waheeda Rehman is barely recognizable. Not only does she look different but even her voice is distinct from what we&apos;re familiar with. She&apos;s clearly a master of her craft. The same can be said of Sharmila Tagore and Shabana Azmi who are nothing short of remarkable. Kiran Vairale is vivacious as the lively young Chimki.\n\n&apos;Namkeen&apos; is one of Gulzar&apos;s most underrated works and it is a treat to watch. Thanks to Gulzar for giving us a glimpse of the lives of these colourful characters."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gina Wild - Jetzt wird es schmutzig&quot; (Now It&apos;s Getting Dirty), directed by Harry S. Morgan, is a 1999 adult film that delivers on its promise of raw, unbridled passion. The film, which is a staple of the late 90s adult industry for its unapologetic approach to sexual exploration and its ability to captivate viewers with its explicit content.\n\nThe film&apos;s strongest asset is its lead actress, Gina Wild, who brings an undeniable charisma and energy to her performances. Wild&apos;s scenes are the film&apos;s standout moments, particularly her double penetration scene with Bruno SX and Richard Langin. The scene is a testament to Wild&apos;s ability to command the screen, her palpable chemistry with her co-stars, and her willingness to push boundaries.\n\nAnother notable scene involves Illona, who finds herself in a similarly intense situation. Illona&apos;s double penetration scene with Bruno SX and Richard Langin is a highlight of the film, showcasing the actress&apos;s ability to handle the physical demands of the scene while maintaining a level of emotional intensity that keeps viewers engaged.\n\nHarry S. Morgan&apos;s direction is competent, if not particularly innovative. The film&apos;s pacing is consistent, and Morgan effectively builds tension leading up to the film&apos;s more explicit scenes. However, the film&apos;s visual style is somewhat dated, and Morgan&apos;s use of music and editing techniques can feel a bit heavy-handed at times.\n\nThe film&apos;s narrative, while not particularly complex, serves its purpose in setting up the film&apos;s various sexual encounters. The dialogue is often cheesy and over-the-top, but this is par for the course in the adult film genre.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Gina Wild - Jetzt wird es schmutzig&quot; is a solid entry in the adult film genre. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling or visual style, it delivers on its promise of explicit, gratuitous content. Fans of Gina Wild or late 90s adult films will find plenty to enjoy in this steamy, unapologetic romp.",

      "reviewBody": "I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.\n\nThe story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it&apos;s being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.\n\nDirecting wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.\n\nSame thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes&apos; work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.\n\nThe musical score is done by Michael Brook who&apos;s also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who&apos;s also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.\n\nLogan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan&apos;s performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.\n\nEmma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it&apos;s nothing distracting and it didn&apos;t really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.\n\nThe second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who&apos;s not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I&apos;ve seen almost all of his work, and he&apos;s becoming a great actor who&apos;s very rare in the sense that he&apos;s brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he&apos;s in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.\n\nEveryone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie&apos;s sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine. \n\nThe rest of the cast: Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie&apos;s Doctor were all good, despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He&apos;s also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again, he doesn&apos;t have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably. \n\nWhat makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they&apos;re very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.\n\nI love this movie. It&apos;s amazing. And I&apos;m not just saying this because I&apos;m a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it&apos;s well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I&apos;ve ever seen.",

As such it is an important landmark, even if it is simply a well-composed bit of photography with some decent movement to it: historically important - just the idea of the King of Siam showing up in Sweden seems a bit odd to the modern ear -- if not a great film in and of itself. Well, they can&apos;t all be great.\n\nSwedish talent would improve immeasurably over time, even as its subjects would darken in attitude. In another ten years, Swedish and Denmark would be the leading film production countries in the world, until overtaken by France and then later, the United States.",

There is little to no fear elements in the movie, but it&apos;s such a beautiful story about a ghost that it can&apos;t be ignored.\n\nIf you think you can figure this movie out by the synopsis above, think again- &apos;The Invisible&apos; is a epic story about life, death and the choices you make during your time on this Earth. For such a bright film, it&apos;s quite Gothic in a sense of the irony the story evokes. In the end, what really matters is making your life worth something and taking control of it on your own- the lesson is a great one, and hopefully this movie will entertain along with inspire. Check it out if you can.",

      "reviewBody": "If you like to watch teenage-based movies, you would like this movie. It is filled with perplexing angst and drama that any teen goes through. It is about this 18-year-old Jakob, who comes back home after spending time with his father. He lives with his sister for a while, and meets a beautiful young woman, Wanda, who is an Au-Pair from Poland. Now, you all know how it goes: boy meets girl, girl meets boy. But what makes this movie different is the reality of it all. It&apos;s not all &quot;Look at me I&apos;m a teenager, that&apos;s why I have issues&quot; it&apos;s more to the truth of what it is really like to be a teen. The emotions, the problems and the sense of self-pity that they seem to have clouding their judgment. It&apos;s so real, it&apos;s amazing for a movie. I cannot understand German, but I read the subtitles and listened to their voices and the acting is amazing. Particularly coming from Jakob, played by Tom Schilling, the acting is natural and forthright. Every scene he was in was mesmerizing, he made his character so real you wouldn&apos;t know you were watching a movie if your mother wouldn&apos;t have been so rude as to talk to you whilst you were watching such beautiful acting! Also the character of Wanda was also played brilliantly by Alicja Bachleda-Curus, who knows how to bring the bewildered outsider into her role. They are the stand outs, but the sister Petra (Anna Von Berg) is acted superbly as well. I have always found foreign movies a lot more interesting to watch on screen, as it is such a good change of culture and mock of the way of life from whatever country the movie is from. As I said before, I cannot speak German, so maybe the acting was a lot worse than I would have thought if it was in English but I couldn&apos;t pick our their flaws like I could if it was a fake, re-make made by Hollywood. Being a sucker for kiddo drama, I enjoyed it thoroughly, although I doubt too many people will agree unless they are like myself! Different plot, awesome, matured characters and fantastic actors. I must also point out that Tom Schilling eyes are exquisite. 8/10",

The plot is relatively straight forward. A German officer who is stationed in the Ukraine during World War II finds out that there is a famous football player in a work crew of Hungarian political prisoners. Lured by his love of the game and by promises of extra rations and reduced work, the prisoner agrees to play in an exhibition game against German soldiers. But first he has to find 10 other prisoners who are strong and talented enough to make up the rest of the team. And that is just the start of his problems...The result is an effectively told tale with many strong characters and occasional bits of humor and communist propaganda thrown in. The movie drags a little bit here and there but the football match is pretty suspenseful and makes the wait worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was done really well. I loved the message about taking Christ out of Christmas. I was equally pleased with the presentation of the Bible. There were only 2 parts in this movie that I think could have been written more accurately to portray Christianity. The first situation was at the beginning when the family was talking about the book that they were reading (vampires falling in love) which is easy to see as supporting the Twilight series. This to me is distasteful and didn&apos;t need to be in there. Any other thing could have been discussed between mother and daughter instead of promoting Twilight. If you truly love God, why would you want to put this demonic stuff in a Christian show? The second situation I wish was rewritten was the part when the dad was talking with the son about his &quot;girl&quot; friend. The father asks his son if she&apos;s cute. He responds with a yes. Then the dad (without knowing anything about the girl) comes back with, &quot;That&apos;s my son!&quot; This portrays to all boys that you should look for a good-looking girl and to all girls that acquiring physical beauty is important if you want to find a guy. What does it say in the Bible about beauty? Beauty is deceitful, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. If these 2 scenes were taken out of this movie, I would have rated it probably a 9. I am just tired of seeing weak Christianity portrayed on television. Now, Courageous is not a weak Christian film and I would give that a 10!"

      "reviewBody": "For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film&apos;s pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is anything but &quot;superficial&quot;, and &quot;teen comedy&quot; does not describe this movie at all.\n\nSet in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter &quot;Joe Black&quot; (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda.\n\nThis is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There&apos;s lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.\n\nThe film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There&apos;s no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.\n\nThe acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul.\n\nFor viewers who liked &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; most highly.",

Bishop&apos;s contact to the Organization is Harry, a long time confidant of his late father. Bishop is meticulous in his work. He is without feelings or remorse, the consummate professional. Bishop&apos;s next target is Harry. He carries the job through without hesitation. Harry&apos;s son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) lives the life of a dilettante playboy. He suspects Bishop&apos;s involvement in his father&apos;s death, and tries to find out what his ties to the Organization truly are. \n\nCritique: As far as spy and espionage films go &apos;The Mechanic&apos; is one of the best. Not only for those Charles Bronson aficionados (like myself), but for lovers of well-made action films. Michael Winner&apos;s clever direction adds a sparkle to the genre. He sets up interesting insights into an assassin&apos;s mode of work. \n\nA cut above Death Wish (1974- Bronson&apos;s best known film), in both content and script, Bronson&apos;s performance is the epitome of cool. He&apos;s perfect at playing a character that has been totally detached from the outside world, and a man trapped in a world he can only have created. In the same way that Steve McQueen used his laconic presence to great effect, Winner makes full use of Bronson&apos;s craggy features.\n\nQUOTE: Bishop: &quot;Murder is killing without a license. Everybody kills.&quot;",

Another negative: the clumsy flashback structure plays havoc with the pacing of the story. Still watchable, but a definite misfire.",

I just can&apos;t understand why this &quot;El Crimen del Padre Amaro&quot; was so praised by most critics. Anyway, it&apos;s sad to see that such a strong book was so poorly adapted. It isn&apos;t horrible, but could have been too much better. 4 out of 10.\n\n&quot;One of the most controversial films ever made&quot;? NO WAY!"

      "reviewBody": "Although Hitler somehow survived the failed July assassination attempt his paranoia increased. One of the few high-ranking officers he felt he could still trust was Dietrich von Choltitz. He had served Hitler well and was an officer who could be relied upon to obey orders implicitly. Hitler appointed him Governor-General of Paris with instructions to restore order and if need be destroy Paris rather than let it fall into Allied hands. Every bridge and monument was mined. This and the general insurrection led by the French Communist Party combined to make this a momentous and perilous time in the history of the French capital. As the Allies approached, von Choltitz rescinded Hitler&apos;s order. Seventy-five years on it is almost impossible to appreciate just how close Paris came to total destuction.\n\nThese events should, in theory anyway, provide sufficient material for a first-class movie, especially with René Clément at the helm.\n\nIn reality alas the film is a dud. One can try and find reasons. Personally I think it is down to a variety of factors: at a little under three hours it rambles; the newsreel footage is far more interesting and thrilling than the filmed action; there is an irritating mish mash of accents with some decidedly dodgy dubbing; there are too many writers and far too many famous faces. One critic at the time observed that the flames were extinguished by the shower of stars! The performance that stands out is that of Orson Welles as Swedish Consul Raoul Nordling, an unsung hero whose diplomatic relationship with von Choltitz assuredly influenced the latter&apos;s thinking. This relationship is very well depicted in Volker Schloendorff&apos;s film &apos;Diplomacy&apos; with Niels Arestrup and Andre Dussollier as General and Consul.\n\nThe scene that really packs a punch is the sight and sound of the bell of Notre Dame which had been silenced for over four years. This is especially poignant in light of the recent fire that engulfed this monumental edifice. Clement has also included a rendition of &apos;La Marseillaise&apos; which never fails to move. Needless to say the film was a tremendous success in France and Maurice Jarre&apos;s rather hurdy-gurdy &apos;Paris Waltz&apos; theme extremely popular in its own right. Big budget plus well known actors equals great film? In this case decidedly not. Strange indeed that &apos;The Longest Day&apos; which had no less than five directors, seems to work better than this with just the one. The real star of course is Paris itself.",

However, the experience put poor Valerie in a mental institution, leaving her tomboyish little sister and the girls&apos; mother alone to cope.  That was years ago, however and now young Courtney has grown up to be a teenage knockout, who just happens to look like Crystal Bernard of the TV show &quot;Wings&quot; fame.  She is struggling to live a normal life, despite terrible dreams involving her institutionalized sister, blood, gore, smoke and a James Dean-from Hell looking Rock N Roller, who just happens to use as his weapon of choice, GET THIS, a fire engine red guitar drill!  She tries to put her dreams out of her mind by accompanying her girlfriends on a weekend of fun and partying, but her dreams go right along with her, as poor Courtney begins to have insane hallucinations involving the black clad shock rocker from her dreams.  As this is going on, her friends slowly begin to disappear one by one.  Can it be true?  Has the Driller Killer been reincarnated as kind of a demonic Elvis Presley?  Or is Miss Courtney Bates ready for a one way trip to the Booby Hatch? While this movie may not be (Ok, IS NOT) the greatest movie ever made, it does qualify as a KILLER B Movie (Pardon The Pun).  Besides, let&apos;s be honest folks, who wouldn&apos;t want to own the Driller Killer&apos;s Guitar Drill?  The Guitar Drill ALONE makes the movie worth seeing, and the gore sequences and fire special effects DON&apos;T hurt."

      "reviewBody": "Alright, whether or not &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot; is The Asylum&apos;s attempt to cash in on the (what looks to become a major picture) &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot; or not, well I have no idea about that. But it does seem a bit strange that just prior to the major Hollywood production release of the latter movie, The Asylum decided to put this on the market. That being said, then it seems awfully a lot like what happened with &quot;I am Omega&quot; and the major Hollywood picture &quot;I am Legend&quot; incident.\n\nRegardless of the reasons for why &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot; came into existence, then I have now seen it, not because I am American (which I am not), nor because it was with historically important American president Abraham Lincoln, no, but simply because it was something with zombies.\n\nTaking place during the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln and a selection of twelve secret service agents find themselves facing a threat of the living dead as they attempt to take over a ford. However, the living dead is not the only enemy the Union people are facing.\n\nThe story, oddly enough, was actually rather captivating and it managed to keep me interested right up to the very end. The storyline is a bit out there, when you think about it, but then again, isn&apos;t anything with zombies that? But that is not what I mean. What I meant was taking a historically important figure like Abraham Lincoln and have him battle zombies with a scythe? (And then later on this year, he will be battling vampires!) But oddly enough, in a comical sense, then the movie actually worked out quite nicely.\n\nHaving seen a bunch of previous works from The Asylum, then I can honestly say that they went all in this time, guns blazing and digging deep into their pockets. This movie is such a major step up the ladder, production-wise, for The Asylum, and just looking at the movie on the screen is a testament to them suiting up and stepping up to join the major league of movie production. The cinematography was great, the effects were great, and the people they had cast did great jobs. So it was really a refreshing touch to The Asylum&apos;s production value.\n\nAs for the zombies in &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot;, well, then they actually looked alright, though there wasn&apos;t any major decay going on in them, as I assume they were to be recently deceased, and that worked out okay. The gore in the movie was alright as well, it just enough to keep a gorehound like me interested. And again, it was nice to see The Asylum step up and use better effects and CGIs for a change. However, one thing did puzzle me about the zombies. They opted to stray from the mainstream zombie, and had them standing about in a deathlike-slumbering trance when they weren&apos;t agitated by sound. That I found odd, why would they only be attracted to sound? So they had all lost the sense of sight? But again, it is a matter of personal preference I suppose. Some like Romero-style zombies, some like the fast and agile zombies as those seen in &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, and some like something else entirely.\n\nI found &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot; to actually be good entertainment value. There wasn&apos;t any scares or real shock scenes in the movie, which would have been nice. But still, if you like zombie movies and wouldn&apos;t mind seeing a somewhat comical approach to the take on Abraham Lincoln, then &quot;Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies&quot; is definitely worth checking out.\n\nAs for the ending of the movie, well I am not revealing anything here, but there is a twist there in wait. I, personally, didn&apos;t really like it, but it was a nice turn of events nonetheless.",

Many gripping moments include the &quot;return&quot; of a young woman (played by a very young Hildegard Knef) who had spent years in Nazi concentration camps. Her innocence and purity are reflected in the woman&apos;s complete willingness to &quot;forgive and forget&quot; the attrocities witnessed and experienced.\n\nA main character was a commanding officer responsible for horrible acts against innocent civilians, while another had refused to take part in such evil. The final scenes &quot;drive home&quot; the message how some feel no remorse for their evil deeds, while others remain plagued with the images of those mercilessly tortured and murdered. \n\nSeeing the young woman who had been victimized by the evil regime step in to prevent a altercation between the man she loves and the man responsible for much of the suffering shows that humans are capable of forgiving and thus surviving into a better life, free of hate and vengeance.\n\nI highly recommend the original German version with or without the subtitles. Many of the effects require the original sound track. This would be a valuable teaching tool for an advanced German class, or a related European History lesson",

Perhaps even, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. And this year, it&apos;s time to think big... &quot;Big Fish&quot;, to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there&apos;s no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there&apos;s barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he&apos;s shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H&quot;agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don&apos;t believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci&apos;s completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn&apos;t enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of &quot;Big Fish: The Animated Series&quot; or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie. It definitely is more deserving of praise, awards and viewers than any other movie released during the past six months, including LOTR-RotK."

The killer ants cover a wide area, sweep everything before them and naturally are headed straight for Leiningen&apos;s cocoa plantation. The dislike between bride and groom nearly upstages the approaching army of ants. Eleanor Parker and Charlton Heston make a handsome couple but she seems to be everything he is not. Parker is confident, poised and self-assured while Heston is insecure, inadequate and out of his depth in her company. Perhaps this explains why he spends so much time trying to diminish her. The film leans heavily on the verbal sparring between Parker and Heston while building tension for the showdown with Marabunta. William Conrad is good in an early role as a jungle commissioner.",

Although the film is said to be inspired by the non-fiction book &quot;Imperial Life In The Emerald City&quot; by Rajiv Chandrasekaran, a journalist for The Washington Post, the conspiratorial storyline is the invention of Greengrass who developed the original script.\n\nIf the tension isn&apos;t as excruciating at that other Iraq movie &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, at least &quot;Green Zone&quot; has a narrative and poses some questions, hard questions that many American viewers would probably were rather not aired: what was the source of the &apos;intelligence&apos; that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction? why was the source so readily believed when the evidence was so thin? could the bloody insurgency which followed the relatively easy initial occupation have been avoided if the Americans had been willing to work with elements of the Iraqi army? \n\nSee the movie and think about the issues.

      "reviewBody": "This is an excellent entry in the Hammer studios series of vampire flicks. Almost everything that fans love about this particular vein of horror is here; the great Peter Cushing as Van Helsing, atmospheric sets and lighting, a creepy baroness, direction from the celebrated Terence Fisher... damsels in danger and the various tropes of the genre. What could be considered missing is Dracula. This is potentially confusing since the film is titled &apos;The Brides of Dracula&apos;, but is clearly set after Dracula&apos;s first demise in the series time-line.\n\nWhat sets this apart as a relatively very good film is the amount of events they managed to squeeze in - which allows actors such as Cushing to flex their ability in a few interesting scenarios. What hasn&apos;t aged so well is the writing/portrayal of the young &apos;heroine&apos;, who seems to spend most of her time stupidly wandering into dangerous situations - acceptable in some cases, but in this film it just makes you question what level of intelligence they were trying to impart to her character.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of &apos;modern&apos; horror, which is more to do with exploitation, you will undoubtedly view this film as very dated with not much to frighten. If you like Hammer horror and understand what it&apos;s &quot;all about&quot;, or have an interest in Gothic horror films from the 50s and 60s, this film will be a very enjoyable screening.",

      "reviewBody": "I read all the reviews and comments before seeing &quot;Crossroads.&quot; Since I got it free from the public library, and &quot;time&quot; was my only investment, I&apos;m not sorry at all. Roughly 50% of IMDb votes are &quot;1&quot; which is totally absurd. A more accurate rating is probably in the 4 to 6 range, compared to all similar films. &quot;Center Stage&quot;, where the central characters are dancers training to make it big in ballet, is a similar film.\n\nOther commentors say &quot;Britney Spears can&apos;t sing.&quot; Those comments are equally absurd. While I&apos;m not particularly a fan of hers, she indeed can sing, very well. As a singer she is as good as most of the rest of the young singers who cater to the teeniebopper audience. She certainly is a better singer than Madonna who achieved her fame on image alone.\n\nCan Britney act? Compared to good young actresses, Britney is fairly amateurish. But she didn&apos;t have to stretch very far for the role of a proper, studious high school valedictorian who decided to look for her mother who abandoned her as a baby to be raised by her single father (Ackroyd). And, along the way write poetry which was then put to music by a young man who drove the three girls west to Los Angeles.\n\nMost of the situations and dialog are silly, and there are many close-range shots of a pretty, smiling Britney. However I suspect they would appeal to the under-15 crowd of Britney fans. I enjoyed the film from the point of view that it gave me some glimpse of the real Britney, one that is not revealed in her concerts and music videos. I believe, as she grows up and out of her former image, she will develop a more mature singing and acting style and will continue her popularity for a long time. (Year 2005 update: I was wrong, she&apos;s become very strange! Year 2007 update: She has gotten even more strange! Year 2008 update: Even her little sister has become strange, and a new mother!!))\n\nCritic Ebert gives an accurate review of the facts in the case, I will not repeat them here. While I probably would not recommend this film to anyone, I personally enjoyed watching it. Not a very good film, still it also is not a bad film. Just juvenile."

In the film, a terminally-ill woman will die unless an experimental drug is administered by the scientist who developed the serum, if I remember correctly, from some type of insect or spider (or was it some deadly plant?).  Her life is saved, but she has developed extraordinary methods of survival and becomes seemingly indestructible.  What can the scientist do to solve this situation?  In many ways, this film is typical of the 50&apos;s &quot;horror&quot; genre as seen in its low-budget, B-list tier of performers and the opinion that a man can save a woman, but who can save a woman from herself (especially one who&apos;s developed into some kind of monster)?  As a kid, I remember being really impressed with a scene where, to avoid being caught, the woman (having developed those incredible survival techniques), mentally changes her hair color from brunette to platinum blonde (much like a chameleon).  I remember thinking that would be really cool to be able to do that!  So while this film is no awards-contender, it&apos;s a memorable quasi-horror title from the 50&apos;s!",

      "name": "Cheap market competitor to Excalibur",
      "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that tries to emulate another film for the sole purpose of capitalizing on its runoff?\n\nNot a whole lot.\n\n&quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; feels like &quot;Excalibur&apos;s&quot; evil twin brother. Boorman used green gels on his lights in his Arthurian film to accentuate the green in the wilderness of the dark ages, and to underscore another theme. &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; also lights its characters with green gels clipped over the lights, but probably only because Boorman did it in his film, because there&apos;s no real purpose for it here.  Boorman&apos;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; had fog effects, Maximillian like armor for the knights, pitched fights on a variety of terrains, and bases its tale on the King Arthur legends.  &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; does this, but with a cheap-budgeted feel.\n\nThe acting, for what it is, is hit or miss depending on the actor and/or scene.  There&apos;s little in the way of high drama here, but the performances are certainly above B-movie quality.  Yet even here it depends on the character.  A couple of the female supporting cast, notably the antagonists, are horribly directed, as is the case with much of the film&apos;s performances. Miles O&apos;Keffe does a pretty good job of portraying a young knight in search of adventure, but his character never really does anything beyond going through the motions of the plot.  Sean Connery does a good job, as usual, though the glitter and mini antlers on his head were just too much.  I don&apos;t know who decided to go with that scheme, but it&apos;s pretty silly. Fortunately we know it&apos;s Connery underneath all that, and his performance helps to take away the two rediculous facets of his costume.  The stunning Cyrielle Claire gives a performance that is much like that of everyone else in this film; good, but somewhat flat due to lack of direction.  Everyone gets the job done in the end, but no Oscars will be found here.\n\nAnd, as has been mentioned, the musical score is one of the worst ever married to a film.  It almost sounds like some public domain music I&apos;ve heard pasted onto cheap 16mm documentaries.  It&apos;s that bad.\n\nBut the worst thing about this movie is the cinematography.  It&apos;s cheap, bland, uninspired, and just plain worthless.  A lot of zooms are used, as are a lot of cheap edits from equally cheap angles.  I might blame the cinematographer, but somehow I get the feel he was just doing this gig to get a paycheque.  There&apos;s no real heart to the look of the film, and that&apos;s the real killer for this movie.  For if it had been better shot, then some of the other negative qualities might&apos;ve been mitigated.\n\nThe art direction is probably the one real plus for this film.  Connery&apos;s antlers and glitter aside, the costuming is fairly good, and the locations, though not very well shot, are likeable, and also fit the overall feel of the film.\n\nAnd for those of you laughing at Mile&apos;s O&apos;Keefe&apos;s &quot;page boy&quot; haircut you should know that a page-boy was squire in training in a medieval court. Pages were young boys who ran errands and served both lords and ladies of a castle, learning manners and other skills that would serve them should they ever reach knighthood.  Their hair was usually cut short with bangs all around.  This is where the term &quot;page boy haircut&quot; comes from.  The worst that can be said is that poor Miles was given a pretty bad wig.  That and the hair was probably too long for the period.  Otherwise it&apos;s fairly accurate.\n\nFor a knock off of a high budgeted production &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; does OK.  In fact given what&apos;s presented the film could&apos;ve been a lot worse, but a talented cast and good art direction can only take a B-movie so far, particularly one that&apos;s poorly shot.  I first saw this film back in the 80&apos;s on HBO, and picked up a cheap copy of the DVD yesterday.  The transfer, as can be expected, isn&apos;t all that good, even though it&apos;s MGM publishing the title.  In fact the only real clean (non-grainy) image is on the trailer that comes as a bonus feature.  Go figure.\n\nIt&apos;s worth a look if you have nothing else better to do, but don&apos;t expect too much from it.  If you&apos;re a die hard fantasy or medieval film fan, then it should entertain.  That and the Linet character is fairly easy on the eyes :-)"

      "name": "From the Mind of Ward Kimball",
      "reviewBody": "For those unaware, Disney&apos;s 9 old men were a group of highly dedicated animators at the mouse house that uncle Walt himself delegated the most tasks to due to their loyalty and expanded interests. One of them, Ward Kimball, was arguably the most diversely artistic of the bunch, pushing for a UPA aesthetic against Walt&apos;s wishes and opting for very comedic subject matter after making the bold move from lead animator to director to journey storyman. Following Walt&apos;s passing in 1966, one of Ward&apos;s most prestigious efforts landed him an Oscar. That film was the animated educational short, It&apos;s Tough to Be a Bird.\n\nThe short is presented by an unnamed red bird (voiced by Richard Bakalyan) as it explains how birds have contributed to human culture. While shown in a quasi-documentary style format, the film lampoons its own subject matter by highly emphasizing the numerous times people have tried to kill all species of birds. By hypothesizing hysterical theories such as humans being jealous of the bird&apos;s ability to fly, a lot of humor is shown through mythological beings like Icarus, prehistoric bird ancestors and even recorded footage of unsuccessful flying machines. Although its approach can feel rather dry and sometimes pad out a bit too much for its own good, Bakalyan&apos;s amusing performance adds a relatable edge to the picture where it may have felt naked without it. It&apos;s hard to say how much creative control Kimball had behind the project, but given how much he embraced the endless possibilities of how birds operate, there&apos;s no denying how much fun he and the small crew behind the featurette had in putting this oddball documentary together.\n\nAs far as art direction is concerned, the character design and animation is a lot more abstract and crude than the average Disney cartoon, not at all hidden by the infamous Xerox process. However, it works with the content provided by emulating the humorous stab at educational documentaries and the simplicity of the end goal, which is to get its point across briskly without fail. On a side note, the occasional mix of live-action paints a solid contrast of real people analyzing birds of their own free will, almost as if the film is reminding us of how we perceive wildlife. Bird watching doesn&apos;t seem to be looked upon too much nowadays, which is a shame because it&apos;s such a relaxing hobby for anyone of the right age range. Lastly, the minor albeit harmonious score from veteran Disney composer George Bruns adds a calm cleansing nature to the otherwise hysterical farce of an educational flick. Also, the addition of When The Buzzards Return To Hinckley Ridge marks a delightfully whimsical melody courtesy of comedian / singer Ruth Buzzi; not too long to outstay its welcome either.\n\nIt really is tough to be a bird, let alone any animal species for that matter, but it&apos;s also tough to make an educational piece this entertaining on them. Despite Ward Kimball largely being known for his animation efforts to classics like Pinocchio, Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland, his directorial efforts should not be overlooked, as they showcase his nutty sense of humor unmatched by anyone else working at Disney at the time. His legacy has left behind so many marvelous treasures just waiting to be rediscovered outside of animation circles, so this one should be no exception. It&apos;s not so tough to be curious.",

The two women give stunning performances.\n\nThe film is a tad preachy with the AA message but Hayward and Van Fleet (born a year apart) are a feast. I don&apos;t think any actress ever gave better performances as a drunk than Hayward (SMASH-UP), And Van Fleet, who made her film debut in 1955, scored in this film as well as EAST OF EDEN and THE ROSE TATTOO--all in 1955! Richard Conte, Eddie Albert, Margo, Don Taylor, Virginia Gregg, Ray Danton, Henry Kulky, Veda Ann Borg, and Tol Avery co-star......\n\nAnyone know who did the singing voice for Hayward?\n\nLillian Roth was a big stage star who made a few good films in the early 30s and always seemed likable."

      "reviewBody": "Framed as leaked &quot;found footage&quot; from the era of space exploration in the 1970s, Apollo 18 is an attempt to out conspiracy the already rife conspiracy theories concerning the lunar landings. The trouble with framing something as being documentary style footage is you have to get the science right and be free from any loopholes that might break the audience out of the illusion. Apollo 18 falls short on this count. López-Gallego manages to recreate to a certain extent the lunar missions. Portrayed through the various cameras feeding live footage back to Earth we have a Big Brother style look into the doomed from the start space mission. The two man crew of the lunar lander also film themselves on 16mm cameras. Herein lies some of the flaws in the director&apos;s logic. We need to get into the character&apos;s perspective to relate. This is solely done through these 16mm cameras. They film themselves on the moon&apos;s surface as well as personal records in the module. The rest is all caught on remote cameras, the audience being allowed to see the threat before the crew do, privy to the danger the Department of Defence has exposed them to. The live footage makes sense to have been documented; however the 16mm film rolls do not make it out, they share the crews dire fate. How then are we seeing the actions of the crew amidst this found footage? It makes no sense pulling any reasonably astute watcher beyond the line of suspension of disbelief.\n\nIt seems clear López-Gallego wants us to care about the cast. We need to care for the conspiracy theory to resonate. The story very directly harks into the era of Watergate where the powers that be cannot be trusted. But his illusion of found footage does not stand up at all well. Does the story really fail on this account? No. It&apos;s actually fairly entertaining as it goes. The tension builds; the threat is revealed and played out. However the conspiracy theme and the documentary framing lend the film no real benefit and do not pay off. While there is reams of data on the films website to build the conspiracy it is not present enough on screen to sideline the notion we are victim to a none to subtle slight of hand. \n\nWhat the film did do with the early footage was remind me why, as a child, I was so fascinated with space. It shows with sufficient realism what the actual Apollo astronauts did and how we as a planet reached for the stars. This is not history as it tries to suggest, but it is a reminder, to me at least, of how sad it is that we no longer pursue such epic destinations as the moon or beyond."

      "reviewBody": "1944&apos;s &quot;Going My Way&quot; was a wispy-thin Oscar winner with only Barry Fitzgerald&apos;s adorable curmudgeon-ness to lift it out of sugary banality; this sequel drops Barry, so it shouldn&apos;t be of much use. However, director Leo McCarey actually pulls off a winner. Bing Crosby is back as Father O&apos;Malley, and he&apos;s more human here than before, and his warm, witty battles with sister Ingrid Bergman are a delight (it helps that Bergman is possibly the most glowing, knowing, embraceable nun in Hollywood history!). Their smooth trials with the students and each other at St. Mary&apos;s have a seamless professionalism that, while not especially fresh, works the audience over with sheer good will. A sub-plot involving a troubled young girl (the excellent Joan Carroll) and her mother is a dandy heart-tugger, and the light music involved isn&apos;t such an obvious device as it was in &quot;Going My Way&quot;; the songs are there, but they&apos;re unobtrusive. A very good film, one that triumphs over its predecessor. Bing proves to be a solid actor here, not just a personality; he makes Father O&apos;Malley a reachable character rather than just a holy rascal. Watch for his hesitation at the very end, and the thoughtfulness he gives to the scene. Admirably, Crosby gives back this time around. ***1/2 from ****",

It mixes realism with outstanding action sequences that still today haven&apos;t been done this good in Sweden. I haven&apos;t seen Mannen pa mallorca by Widerberg but that might be the one that ties this film. My favourite scene is probably when Martin Beck is on stakeout in an apartment where he tries to spot the killer. The scene is very well made and the old lady who owns the apartment is mostly concerned that Martin drinks his coffe and eat his cookies. It&apos;s pure magic. The best actor in this movie is Hakan Serner in a minor role, he portray the dull everyday life perfectly and it is very easy to imagine that this guy has been in the force way to long. A must see!",

      "reviewBody": "Having criticized the writer of &quot;Connie and Carla&quot; for not recognizing the writers of &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; in the credits, I&apos;d be a hypocrite not to fault the writers of &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; for not thanking the writers of &quot;Big&quot; (and probably &quot;Vice Versa&quot; and all those switch-comedies of the 1980s).\n\nBut unlike the wretched and dreadfully unfunny &quot;Connie and Carla,&quot; which featured two horrible performances by the male and female leads, &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; is helped immensely by an utterly charming and winning performance by Jennifer Garner and yet another wonderful turn by Mark Ruffalo, who&apos;s fast becoming one of the best actors of his generation.\n\nGarner has a smile that would melt the heart of the severest cynic and she uses that to great effect. She brilliantly captures the awkwardness of a confused teenager stuck in a 30-year-old body and is thoroughly believable as Jenna. There&apos;s a captivating sweetness to her performance that&apos;s lovely to watch. Ruffalo plays Matt with understated grace - there are scenes in this film that could easily have been played over-the-top, but it&apos;s his low-key approach that makes them all the more convincing.\n\nThe story, itself, is awfully conventional. There&apos;s nothing new or unexpected here. Even the odd twist in the plot provides nothing unpredictable. So it&apos;s up to the actors to elevate this above the ordinary and mundane. This film pours on the schmaltz at times, but it&apos;s Garner and Ruffalo who help take the schmaltzy plot and somehow make it work. This film succeeds solely because of their performances. Garner proved she could do action with TV&apos;s &quot;Alias&quot; and the dull &quot;Daredevil,&quot; and now she shows she&apos;s a damn fine comedic actress, too.\n\nRomantic comedies are inherently predictable. It&apos;s the nature of the genre. And, more often than not nowadays, they&apos;re also incredibly dull, uninspiring and make for tough viewing. And &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; being a Hollywood, not independent, film, you know the writers aren&apos;t going to take any risks with their story. \n\nBut somehow thanks to Garner and Ruffalo, &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; has undeniable charm. It may not leave a lasting impression, but you leave the theatre smiling and that&apos;s more than what can be said of most romantic comedies these days.",

The girls are also quite believable and fun to watch. The football scenes are funny, but when it&apos;s not making you laugh, it seems genuine. I also felt drawn into this little town called &quot;Taft&quot;. Here&apos;s this little town that seems quite small with not a lot to do, yet I found something enthralling about it. No doubt the characterizations are a big plus for the film. I highly recommend this movie, whether you like football or not because the cast and director really make it work.",

      "reviewBody": "Obviously Sonny Tufts was really hitting the bottle when he appeared in this film. He was touted as a new star in the 40&apos;s but his messed up personal life really did him in and he was reduced to playing in Grade Z movies and barely getting by. In several scenes he loses his train of thought and because of the low budget the scenes were not re-shot. What a hoot but at the same time pathetic.\n\nThis is one of those little sci-fi films that were so popular in the 1950s, usually low budget and inept. But if you are a bad film buff, you can&apos;t help but love Cat Women. There are some good actors in this film.....Victor Jory (how far he had fallen!); the wonderful Marie Windsor who made any film in which she appeared worth watching; and Douglas Fowley who was a film staple for years. And then there were the Cat Woman, slinking around in leotards and dog collars.\n\nI won&apos;t go into the &quot;plot&quot; but suffice to say it was the same as all the other films which involved lost civilizations on distant moons. It is such fun and if you love low budget films with ridiculous special effects, bad acting and dialogue that makes you cringe, see Cat Women of the Moon. It&apos;s a treat!!",
