      "reviewBody": "THE FLAME AND THE ARROW is one (1) of those films that every ten (10) years we see and are pleasantly surprised how well it holds up. It is also amazing how it appears and disappears. In the 60&apos;s it was on quite frequently, the 70&apos;s not so. American Movie Classics (AMC) showed it often in the 80&apos;s and it came out on VHS. Now it is been buried again so a new generation of viewers are going to have to wait till it comes out on DVD. I have just watched my 80&apos;s VHS recently so this is based upon it.\n\nIt is what other commentators called it ROBIN HOOD JR. That does not mean it is small or poorly made film. Instead you see the full power of a major studio Warner Brothers (WB) behind it. The props and sets many coming from larger films (Adventures of Robin Hood, Elizabeth and Essex, The Adventures of Don Juan) are quite evident and effectively integrated into the story line. Burt Lancaster&apos;s supporting cast consists of the current studio stock company, all professionals. Who knew what to deliver and did so. It had the full Three (3) Strip Technicolor process in all it&apos;s glory and finally Max Steiner&apos;s score. Romantic and rich and appropriate for such a concept. This is a super &apos;B&apos; film and there is no disgrace in that. We have seen plenty of &apos;A&apos; films today that are not half as well done.\n\nIt is though Burt Lancaster that is the central focus of the film. His first &apos;independent&apos; production he knew if he did not carry it well it would have failed. Every time he is on the screen he is the focus of attention and fortunately he is on very often. Whether exchanging insults, engaging in acrobatics or romance he is hitting the target every time. He is ably supported by Virginia Mayo as his leading lady. A underrated actress with a attractive and strong physical presence. Lets be frank, does anyone believe that DARDO would fall for some skinny twit like Audrey Hepburn (or today Angelina Jolie) no way. We did not believe that when Sean Connery did in ROBIN AND MARIAN!\n\nSo if you can check this selection out. Your library may have a copy (mine does) on VHS. We are sure it will be out sometime on DVD. Lancaster later made another period film THE CRIMSON PIRATE. Not quite as good but still fun, but it seemed to lack the backing. polish and push that WB gave THE FLAME AND THE ARROW.\n\nADDENDUM; NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD.",

      "name": "MOTHER’S HEART (Salvatore Samperi, 1969) **1/2",
      "reviewBody": "Curiously enough, I became aware of this movie through its music score: as part of my two-month film-making course in Hollywood in late 2005, I chose to accompany my final project with pieces culled from a CD compilation featuring some of Ennio Morricone’s oddest soundtracks – entitled “Crime &amp; Dissonance”; a good deal of music that I ended up using came from this obscure little item, which back then I thought was a sentimental family drama. Some months ago, it turned up on late-night Italian TV and I took the opportunity to tape the broadcast; having watched the film now, I can say that MOTHER’S HEART is nothing like what I expected it to be! \n\nIndeed, it’s most unusual – and the whole is rendered even stranger by Morricone’s fantastic (and intricate) compositions: the protagonist is a divorced mother (Carla Gravina, still best-known perhaps for playing the possessed lead in THE ANTICHRIST [1974]) of three who may or may not be a mute; we’re never actually told, but the fact remains that she doesn’t utter a single word during the course of the film (and yet people around her seem to act as if awaiting her reply)! While the children are cared for by a cantankerous old maid, she works at a bookshop – however, the heroine’s also involved somehow with a group of revolutionaries. Incidentally, the kids are far more knowledgeable than their years (in the very opening scene, they’re engaged in ‘professional’ tattooing on each other!) – the eldest, in particular, is himself keen on politics and bio-chemistry (he’s obsessed with firing a rocket); it was amusing but, at the same time, weird to hear him accuse his three year-old sibling of being a Communist (which the latter vehemently denies)! And it seems that the precociousness of Gravina’s children is not an isolated case, either, as another mother seeking new reading material at the bookshop for her kid (who, she says, is over the traditional Children’s Classics such as “Treasure Island” and “Around The World In 80 Days”) is suggested De Sade’s “Justine” since it’s the story of a little orphan girl! \n\nThings get even more out of hand: as the mother drifts farther away from her job (eventually being sacked) and duty at home into outright terrorism, the kids come up with their own violent ‘games’ – first by killing their pet cat when, as passenger of the rocket during its test flight, the ‘launch’ backfires and the rocket explodes; then, when the toddler is tragically drowned in the bath-tub! During the funeral (also attended by the father – an underused Philippe Leroy – and his new companion, who’s actually good friends with Gravina!), the eldest son sadistically reads aloud from an encyclopedia the effects of such a terrible death. Later on, after the remaining kids spend some time with Dad (only to embarrass him in front of guests by playing a clandestine recording of his love-making the night before!), the sister also perishes at the hands of her intellectual sibling via a deliberate leakage of gas – which he’s personally able to endure by wearing a self-constructed gas mask!! The mother, then, is forced to take stock of the situation: left alone with the boy – who actually blames her for the two previous deaths (not an entirely unfounded accusation, given her chronic aloofness) – she blows him up while he’s fiddling yet again with the rocket! After this, it’s back to the revolution – except that her former companions have started to disperse: however, by now, the heroine’s learned how to assemble a bomb by herself…with the obvious target being her ex-husband’s pharmaceutical factory! \n\nI’m sure that even from the above synopsis, one is able to grasp just how bizarre this film is; for the record, the only other Samperi effort I’d watched was THANK YOU, AUNT (1968) – which was itself fairly disturbing in view of the incestuous sado-masochistic central relationship and a finale promoting euthanasia! Apart from Morricone’s delightful contribution (frequently providing ironic counterpoint to the on-screen events), the anchor here is clearly Gravina – despite the inherent difficulty in playing a character who’s basically a cipher; incidentally, her rapport with the kids is genuine since the elder couple are the actress’ real-life off-springs! Besides, the film contains a surreal quality to it – which is positively winning…though it’s all eventually worn down by the excessive political rallying.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite all its obvious flaws I&apos;ve always really liked this film and having seen it again recently (and having still enjoyed it) I wondered why it still held its appeal.\n\nYes, the plot groans a bit (for instance, the Anne Francis character, though well-played, seems to serve no purpose - except as a poorly explained romantic interest), the characters are one dimensional (well it is a suspense film and you can always use your imagination), and some of the motivation is a bit suspect; but this film still generates a real tension and sense of terror. It&apos;s a well-imagined, claustrophobic world of neurotic scientists, a secret state, disillusioned spooks, and isolated top-secret labs. There are good performances (especially Jon Anderson, Ed Asner, Frank Sutton, Richard Basehart - despite dodgy Austrian accent - and George Maharis) and a superb, tense score by Jerry Goldsmith that keeps the fear and suspense palpable. The action too remains tight but down-played; it does move forward at a reasonable pace but the emphasis generally remains on the realistic and the prosaic. This lack of the spectacular may be more due to the small scale of the production but for me it fits perfectly to the claustrophobic style of the film and doesn&apos;t detract from the plausability of doomsday-virus-goes-missing plot line; this is key to why the films&apos; appeal has remained strong - the story seems all too possible (and hence frightening), and it certainly is as possible today as it was 40 years ago.\n\nThere are two other stars of this film that deserve special mention. One is the desert - I think much of the the filming was done around Palm Springs in the Colorado Desert. It looks truly beautiful and other-worldly (well if you&apos;re from London it does) but also desolate and lonely. Its emptiness intensifies the sense of paranoia and isolation and serves as a subconscious reminder to the watcher of the apocalypse that the Satan Bug could unleash upon mankind... the other star is a small flask with a red seal that requires just 4 lbs of pressure to break it... if I had to compile a list of the scariest things in cinema I think I&apos;d place that little flask pretty near the top.",

Although Kaufman is probably best remembered for the Marx Brothers &quot;A night at the opera&quot;, you only see the genius of the script when it is performed by a sterling cast who don&apos;t improvise. Although the plot is typical Kaufman it is encrusted with some excellent comic inventions pertinent to the time that may be lost now. Both Jimmy Durante as Banjo and Reginald Gardiner as Beverly Carlton perform excellent parodies of Harpo Marx and Noel Coward respectively. Anne Sheridan is brilliant as the bitch; Davis has never really given a bad performance and as always Mary Wickes as nurse Preen is a joy.",

      "reviewBody": "Kid Galahad (1937) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nEdward G. Robinson plays fight promoter Nick Donati who thinks he has found a fighter (Wayne Morris) he can take to the Championship. The only trouble is Nick&apos;s hot tempered anger, which gets him in trouble with his girlfriend (Bette Davis) and a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who he double crosses. Not to mention his anger when the fighter begins to date his sister (Jane Bryan). This drama from Warner plays a little too long but there&apos;s no denying the extreme fun it contains due to the three legends appearing together as well as the strong supporting cast. The story is pretty predictable if you&apos;ve seen any of the 30&apos;s boxing pictures but then again the genre had pretty much wore itself out in terms of plot details by the end of the silent era. With that said, the story here of a hot tempered manager makes for some nice drama but the story isn&apos;t what&apos;s going to bring people to this movie. Seeing Robinson, Davis and Bogart together is where the fun is at and the reason why people will be drawn to this film. It&apos;s rather strange that the Elvis remake was more popular than this one for sometime but I&apos;m going to guess that was due to this one not being available for so many decades. Robinson turns in a good performance but it&apos;s certainly not among his best. Bogart is a lot of fun in his supporting role as the tough gangster. Davis nearly steals the film and delivers a very good performance as the woman always having to keep Robinson&apos;s temperature down. The real surprise comes from Bryan and Morris who are perfect together and steal the show in the end. Film buffs might not find too many original ideas here but that doesn&apos;t really matter due to the wonderful cast being held together by the strong direction of Curtiz."

What could have been just never was. No character development whatsoever.  No real laughs. No plot explanation.  I never understood what was so great about this guy, or so bad about the women that they would fight so hard for him. CP can be a fun movie like a child&apos;s roller coaster.  Kinda fast, kinda fun, but not really."

Unaware of his identity, the students welcome him into the fold, until a prejudiced student (Damon) discloses his identity after discovering a romantic friendship developing between his own girlfriend (Amy Locane) and Greene. When one of the students cheats on his final exam - and Greene is accused - the class is requested to deliberate on a verdict, forcing them to choose between their own personal prejudices and the struggle to be impartial.

      "reviewBody": "Chameleon by Bev Questad, Feb. 25, 2010\n\n&quot;We all had the same dream. Not women. Not Fame. Not a house. But cash because that meant that you were someone.&quot;\n\nThis is another Hideous Man Show – but this bad dude meets the seemingly angelic, beautiful, seductive, duplicitous Hideous Woman. \n\nChameleon, the 2009 film submitted from Hungary for Oscar consideration, is worth seeing. Sure, there are contrivances and quite possibly the psychologist, played by László Áron, is a little too seedy. But this film is loaded with exceptional casting, acting, and psychological illumination.\n\nThe Greek term for chameleon means ground lion. A chameleon adapts to its environment to avoid detection by its predators, slinking close to its base, changing colors to falsely blend in. \n\nEnter Gabor Farkas (Ervin Nagy), a seductive liar. Nagy has said about his role that his character didn&apos;t say one honest thing in the whole film. In the movie Farkas rationalizes, &quot;Women believe what they want to. I don&apos;t trick them.&quot; \n\nAdapting, sneaking, creeping around the garbage of people&apos;s lives to strike them at their most vulnerable, flicking that hypnotic tongue, luring in the prey, Farkas is the ultimate trickster, the consummate disgusting liar, manipulating the unsuspecting with his charm and wit.\n\nWomanizers like Farkas struggle with low self-esteem and many, like our orphan protagonist, have had unstable or nonexistent relationships with father figures, especially in early childhood. This makes them feel unsure about their own self-worth, their basic identity and their own sense of power. \n\nAbandoned by his parents, Farkas grew up in an orphanage. He plays a version of the powerless male who maneuvers through &quot;pretending&quot; to blend in, in order to be accepted by a society which essentially rejected him in his formative years. With his focus on adaptation rather than introspection, he is lost, without a sense of his own distinct self. When asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; Farkas side-steps with unintentional honesty, &quot;That&apos;s a good question.&quot;\n\nFarkas (Nagy) has created so many identities, succeeding so well in so many roles, that he perhaps would think he deserves notice amongst the paintings of great actors at the New York City Players Club. However, unlike the best of actors, his psychopathic nature is incapable of guilt or empathizing. He is incapable of tears and, conversely, of feeling true joy. He is incapable of a true union with a woman or the society he is so busy trying to prove that he is better than. \n\nIn an interview Ervin Nagy explains, &quot;I don&apos;t think I have ever had a more challenging or complex role before. I was playing a different personality in almost every single moment. The main character is an underprivileged country lad with a hard life behind him who moves up to the capital and the only money-making option that he sees a future in is the scheme of deception. So ultimately, he becomes a con artist. We would like to see a realistic picture of his psyche they said to me&quot; (Hungarian Filmweek.com).\n\nAnd Nagy does the job. His most brilliant scene is the first time he unwittingly falls prey to his own quarry – his affected seduction by an orthopedist (played with extraordinary depth by the singer/actor, Janos Kulka) results in a calculated closing insult beyond our chameleon&apos;s limited expectations. And the karma begins.\n\nThe central plot involves Farkas (Nagy) becoming obsessed with seducing one woman, a Madonna-like ballerina named Hanna Hartay, played by the lovely Gabi Hamori. His original intent, like with all his other conquests, was to seduce her in order to tap into her financial assets. As soon as he got a pay-off he&apos;d leave her and prowl for a new victim. However, the tables soon turn and she becomes the one who needs the money from him – as well as the one factor in Farkas&apos; life with the power to transform or destroy him. \n\nThe denouement of this film ironically involves a succession of remarkable karmic twists and convolutions. &quot;Chameleon&quot; labels the protagonist as well as a surprising group of others. Entertaining, insightful and surprising.",

My daughter and I watched this together and laughed out loud quite a bit.  Luke Wilson did a great job as the moony eyed helicopter pilot who falls for Drew&apos;s character. Drew did a good job as a confused but sweet pregnant girl who works at a burger joint in somewhere in small town America.  Jake Busey looks a whole lot like his dad, and chewed a lot of furniture for this role, which was rather one dimensional. Catherine O&apos;Hara is at her best playing this quirky mom.  (during one funny scene, the older boy asks her if it&apos;s true that she liked the other son better...&quot;I love you both, she says, but the difference is only this (puts her fingers an inch apart) much!LOL!!!) If you don&apos;t enjoy dark humor, this will not amuse you.  It also had an ending that made us go &quot;awww&quot;...it was almost as if they weren&apos;t sure how to end this one, though.  Overall, it wasn&apos;t a bad film.",

      "reviewBody": "You may find this hard to see. It is a Japanese &quot;new wave,&quot; film. It has a story of course, but such things are largely irrelevant. I&apos;ll give it because you may not see it. (In my comments, I assume most folks have seen the film.)\n\nA young man was abandoned as a child, and continuously molested by his adoptive father. He falls &quot;in love&quot; with a prostitute, around the same time he is imprisoned for molesting a four year old girl. We follow him and the prostitute (actually a &quot;model&quot;) separately; that&apos;s most of the film, timewise. The story ends tragically.\n\nIts shot with hand-held cameras, and even by today&apos;s standards the camera movements are obviously there to remind you that there is a camera present. Not your eyes, but a physical camera.\n\nFollowing the French notion, the &quot;new wave&quot; ideas are followed: the fact that it is a film is explicit and films are referenced throughout the thing. And the elements of the story are abstracted  usually from the most raw and common experience, love  into something synthetic, which only can exists in cinema. These two elements were thought by the French create a new film narrative: not using the camera to place you in life, but the other way around, using life to allow you to travel to a new place, abstract, pure and effective within its own rules.\n\nThat French experiment collapsed, I think, because as a class, French intellectuals don&apos;t have much horsepower, so after we get the cleverness of us being placed in this synthetic world, we look for a reason to be there other than tourism from boredom. The Japanese, on the other hand, actually live is an abstract world, deliberately so. And its of much the same type  less now than 40-50 years ago (unless you count manga). By this I mean that the narrative they live in is close to the one they imagine, and they&apos;ve had 1500 years of continuous stylization to abstract the narrative into a coherent collection of edges.\n\nSo when I encounter Japanese new wave films, or better, those that quote and extend the concept, I know I&apos;m where the idea wanted to be, but was couldn&apos;t go there with its originators.\n\nThis one isn&apos;t powerful in the way the HongKongers Wong Kar Wai and Fruit Chan do, but it has oompf if you allow for the amazingly noticeable proscription on pubic hair  but that&apos;s part of the game.\n\nAlong the way, we have all sorts of side stories, as if they were movies within the movie. Some are flashbacks that are movies in the mind. Others are of the same type, but everyday events: a pocketknife is dropped; a foil gumwrapper blows in the wind.\n\nAnd these are interspersed with overt films within. We have a film about first love our lovers attend. She is a model for filmed stories, always pornographic (but indicated here as topless cheesecake because of the censorship) and often violent. He purchases a record designed to have a conversation with him. Much of the action touches on or is in a graveyard, shown as a collection of storymarkers for the dead.\n\nAn item that permeates is a riddle. If you peel a cabbage, you get a core. If you peel an onion, what do you get? The film is intended to be a peeling of the onion. You&apos;ll need to watch the film (or email me) to get the answer to the riddle.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Yi jang chun shui xiang dong liu&quot; was a great commercial success of its&apos; time. After watching it, it is easy to understand why: it is simply so easy to love (and hate) the main characters, who are wonderfully played by Yang Bai and Tao Jin. Melodramas as strong as this are usually pretty ridiculous, but not when the characters are like members of your own family.\n\nIn the beginning we have a happy family who works in a factory in Shanghai of the 30&apos;s. When the Japanese attack, the husband leaves her wife, mother and son behind to fight against the cruel invaders. For eight years they are separated. In that time, the waiting wife has to face all kinds of horrors of the war and poverty, while husband marries another woman (a rich one) in another city. He becomes a bourgeois who lives a sweet life far away from war. So, the film deals with the subject that has always been so popular among the left-winged film makers: the comparison between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It has the same message as &quot;Die Freundlosse Gasse&quot; and &quot;Konets Sankt-Peterburga&quot;, etc., but it has a far more elegant way of telling it.\n\nThe mother has too many self-pitying lines and the music becomes very irritating at times. These are about all faults there is. That is a excellent effort for a three-hour-long feature. I wonder if we Europeans have ever managed to make as powerful melodrama as this.\n\nHighly recommended to those who still believe in great emotions. Others beware.",

      "reviewBody": "La Boheme is a notoriously unreleased film that sometimes broadcasts on TCM. Thanks to a great cast featuring Lillian Gish, John Gilbert, and Renee Adoree, it is no wonder why fans clamor to see it. The star power indeed makes the film a good one. The story is one of sadness and heartbreak; two people live struggling to make ends meet in a shabby town in France. He is working as a writer, succumbing to pieces for the newspaper for money while he can flesh out his play. She is a seamstress whose love for him leads her to working herself to death. The love story is tragic and beautiful.\n\nI have never understood the appeal of Gilbert, so I was not as interested in his character or, in consequence, the romantic relationship between he and Gish than I could have been. He is not a bad actor; I simply do not gravitate to his type. Gish is wonderful, however, as a pathetic but beautiful woman. One bright spot of this film was the couple&apos;s scenes on a picnic running through the wilderness in the sunlight.",

Maybe we should all be like the characters in this film who start out flawed, yet find a greater sense of self, worth, and duty.\n\nDo yourself a favor: go buy this movie. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "There is a moment in 1964&apos;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; in which Gore Vidal&apos;s script has Henry Fonda watching a presidential convention on television. The audience bursts into prolonged applause. Fonda rises to his feet and remarks, &quot;There will now follow four minutes and thirty seconds of a carefully choreographed spontaneous demonstration&quot; (or something like that). The scene was evidently intended to instruct the audience that not everything in a presidential campaign or, by extension, in politics is what it seems. We&apos;ve come a long way, baby. That audience is now a LOT more -- well, either &quot;sophisticated&quot; or &quot;cynical,&quot; depending on your view of human nature.\n\n&quot;The War Room&quot; covers the Democratic side of the 1992 presidential campaign and election in which, you&apos;ll remember, Bill Clinton was pitted against George Herbert Walker Bush and Ross Perot. Kids -- Clinton won.\n\nSome of the calculation that went on in the war room, the collective name for Clinton&apos;s campaign staff presided over by James Carville and George Stephanopoulis, surprised even me. I&apos;ll give one example, with rough quotes.\n\nCarville is sitting around with his dozen or so co-conspirators and one of them brings up the idea of flooding the floor at the Democratic convention with signs in favor of gun control. &quot;We&apos;ve only got twelve hours,&quot; somebody says, &quot;so where are we going to get signs?&quot; &quot;Can&apos;t we get the people to print the signs themselves?&quot; Somebody says, &quot;No, no. That way you&apos;re going to get a scattered couple of signs. Some will be red on white, other will be white on blue. It will send a mixed message. I just don&apos;t think it will have the same impact as a whole SEA of identical signs all over the floor.&quot; They&apos;re talking about this problem as if they&apos;re trying to solve it for the delegates and visitors on the floor of Madison Square Garden -- just being helpful, you know? -- whereas the WHOLE THING is their own idea! For all they know there may not be a single gun-control thought among the multitude of Clinton supporters, let alone enough to create a sea of signs! They carry on in the same way about most of the issues of the time and most of the current events. Bush&apos;s campaign is having its posters printed in Brazil. Can this fact somehow be turned against them? Not that the other side is virgin pure. Stephanopoulis has to deal with someone on the phone, evidently a journalist, inquiring about a rumor that Clinton has had a child by a black prostitute. Curiously similar to the rumor circulated about McCain when he opposed Bush during the 2004 primaries. In McCain&apos;s case, the rumor was accompanied by photos of &quot;the black child,&quot; who was actually a Bengladesh girl that McCain and his wife had adopted. Nineteen ninety-two was only thirteen years ago but things have gotten a lot dirtier in that time.\n\nAs a movie, &quot;The War Room&quot; is informative, shot casually as the events transpired. There are no long speeches. But it&apos;s unfocused too and the editing sometimes leaves out important developments, which we learn about later. I suppose this can happen when you&apos;re just pointing the camera around and not providing a voice-over. And the film makers must have faced the additional problem that there is no logical narrative to the story. Stuff happens, abruptly and unexpectedly. It&apos;s not the careful reconstruction of an historic contretemps, like &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; or Ken Burns&apos; &quot;The Civil War.&quot; The candidates aside, the most memorable people in the film are James Carville, George Stephanopoulis, and Mary Matalin, Carville&apos;s opposite number on the Republican side. The two of them are from different political poles. Someone should be doing a cinema verite copy of their MARRIAGE. But they have a lot in common too. They&apos;re thick-skinned, devoted, have a sense of humor, and are animated. Carville&apos;s face is so curiously constructed that it looks devilishly lively even in repose. He comes from an old New Orleans family. The hospital for lepers at Carville is named for his ancestors who founded it.\n\nI can&apos;t say I like George Stephanopoulis too much. He looks like the president of my senior class in high school. He&apos;s self-contained, intelligent, thoughtful, clean-cut, handsome, and is much younger than I am. I could live with all the other stuff, but his youth is inexcusable. I&apos;d have liked him a lot better as a stuttering, kyphotic octogenarian who was able to touch the tip of his nose with the tip of his tongue. And his hair was styled so boyishly that I didn&apos;t like THAT either.\n\nThe personality that&apos;s most memorable is Carville&apos;s though. He sits there smiling on election eve and begins imagining what Clinton would say at his concession speech should Bush win. And between the chuckles he spins out an improvised, absolutely spot-on by-the-numbers speech for the Governor. I would like to congratulate President Bush on his victory tonight and assure him that all of us are behind him and that this will be a better America with our help and God&apos;s and my family most of all my wife Hillary and Chelsea and all those of you who have worked so hard on this campaign I&apos;d like to mention So-and-So and our prayers are with the President and let us all cooperate now and move together towards a greater American co-prosperity sphere, no not that, but a more prosperous and happier American which with God&apos;s blessing and blah blah blah. I couldn&apos;t stop laughing.",

      "reviewBody": "Les misérables (1935) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nExceptional version of Victor Hugo&apos;s classic novel about Jean Valjean (Fredric March), a man made a criminal by circumstances but paying for the crime only to then be hounded by an Inspector (Charles Laughton) without any sense of goodness or justice. The mammoth novel doesn&apos;t get the page-by-page treatment but the screenplay does both the novel justice as well as the characters. This novel has been filmed countless times over the decades and many of the versions run four and five hours but this one here clocks in at just 108-minutes so many of the subplots and various other items are naturally missing. I never compare the book to the film so there&apos;s really nothing to be said between them but this movie certainly deserves its classic label for many reasons including two masterful performances from a couple of legends. The screenplay perfectly captures the heart, mood and soul of the novel but its the actors that really bring it to life as both March and Laughton deliver extremely strong performances, which rank among the best I&apos;ve seen from the men and that&apos;s saying quite a lot considering how many great roles they&apos;ve had. Laughton really got under my skin in a good way as I can&apos;t say how many times I wanted to jump through my screen and do bodily harm to him. The character is certainly one of the most known and hated villains in history and I&apos;m sure most actors would have just let the character do all the work but Laughton takes this rather evil man and makes him a real cold snake without any emotions. The way Laughton constantly hounds March and that evil glance in his eye that just makes you feel the coldness is perfectly done. Laughton would gain sympathy in a few years playing the Hunchback from Hugo&apos;s novel so it&apos;s rather amazing to see him play and perfectly capture the other side of the human nature. March too is perfect in his role as I&apos;m sure a role like this is pure heaven for an actor considering how many emotions and various ranges they have to go through. Needless to say, March perfectly nails all of them whether it&apos;s the man begging for pity at the start of the film or the man finally worn down and ready for his justice. When the two are on screen together they play wonderfully well off of one another and really deliver some great scenes. Cedric Hardwicke, Rochelle Hudson and Florence Eldridge add nice support and look quickly for John Carradine in an early role. Fans of the novel will certainly want to check this film out but even if you&apos;re not familiar with the work you&apos;ll still find yourself really eating everything up here. The two legends make this a must-see for fans of classic cinema."

The director did a great job with the creativity of this film. I marked &quot;Superb&quot; on my ballot. This film needs to be released!!! It would be very popular due to its artistic flare, and people want to see movies that move them in all directions which this film does.

A cool political western the theme of which was continued in Sergio Corbucci&apos;s next film Companeros (another very good &apos;Spaghetti Western&apos;).",

      "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this film. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be awfully nitpicky for a family Disney movie. It&apos;s no masterpiece but I can&apos;t understand all the hate.\n\nAs we can all agree, it&apos;s visually stunning. The costumes are magnificent as well as hair and makeup. The sets are stunning and surprisingly, according to some of the interviews I&apos;ve watched, most of it is not CGI. They created a beautifully detailed world and it pays off.\n\nThe story is not the same as the ballet, nor does it claim to be. I personally wouldn&apos;t want it to be the same. We get to experience the beloved elements of The Nutcracker in a new way. Though there&apos;s a lot of room for improvement, specifically in the script, I really enjoyed the new story. The dynamic between Clara and her late mother is great and is the real emotional draw of the film. Because it&apos;s a Disney film aimed at kids, the script is awfully cheesy at times, but not enough to be distracting.\n\nClara herself should be a strong selling point of the film. She&apos;s highly intelligent, specifically in engineering and physics. They make it a point to differentiate Clara from her sister, Louise, a proper (for that time period) young English woman. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with being all prim and proper, in fact, Clara admittedly does spend a lot of the film in beautiful dresses and makeup. And yet, she&apos;s still the hero and she still kicks ass. This is important because it associates these feminine traits with power.\n\nHear me out on this. I feel like so many of the strong heroines we know and love are, in some ways, stripped of their femininity. They&apos;re typically made to be a strict &quot;tomboy&quot; who&apos;s &quot;not like other girls.&quot; This by itself isn&apos;t the problem. The problem is that instead of embracing feminine traits, they diminish them. I know gender roles are bull, believe me, but I don&apos;t think women should be shamed for being what society deems feminine. You can be a bad b**** AND enjoy princess dresses. Women should not have to adopt &quot;masculine&quot; traits in order to succeed. Because of this, I think Clara is a fantastic role model for young girls who will almost undoubtedly take something from her.\n\nSo, although it&apos;s far from perfect, it&apos;s fun, beautiful, and full of heart. It&apos;s not claiming to be the next Shawshank Redemption so I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s being drilled so hard. It&apos;s a delightful little Disney movie, don&apos;t think so much about the specifics and just enjoy.",

Although the setting makes this movie seem very cold, the director was trying to show the isolation that cancer patients feel. This is the type of movie that should open our hearts to those who are sick and realize that some people really are going through this kind of pain."

I cannot believe that Walter Hill, who gave us Red Heat among many other great films, actually directed this. It is a total waste from start to finish. There are some great actors in this trash: Wesley Snipes, Ving Rhames, Peter Falk, and Michael Rooker. Also some bad ones like Fisher Stevens. But the lame script does them all no justice. An attempt at adding tension to the build up to a supposed great fight in the prison inwhich the film is set, falls flat every time a lame caption such as &quot;...9 days to the fight.&quot; appears on screen. And even the actual boxing match is lackluster, when compared to the ones in the Rocky movies. Wesley Snipes hasn&apos;t had a hit film in years, and one hopes that the soon to be released Blade 3 will wash the bad taste of Undisputed out of his fans mouthes.\n\nAVOID at all costs...Unless you wish to see Columbo spit forth about fifty expletives in as many seconds."

I haven&apos;t seen any of the actors before but they all played their parts very well and were fully convincing in their parts. I would definitely watch a part 2 of this movie if one is made. The only reason I think this movie didn&apos;t get a higher review is the subtitles and the fact that it doesn&apos;t have a single A-list actor from Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll be honest, I only saw The Bank Job because I had some free tickets for an advance screening, had I have not got these tickets I would not have bothered seeing it. The only trailer I had saw for it just didn&apos;t really appeal to me, I do enjoy Jason Statham movies, but this one seemed a bit serious in my eyes. Still I went today to the 6.30 screening and was surprised to enjoy it quite as much as I did. Admittedly for the first half hour I did get quite bored, the characters weren&apos;t really memorable and the set up seemed really dull. Thankfully when the heist gets under way, and especially the aftermath, the movie hits top gear and left me thrilled. The fact the movie is based on a true story still leaves me quite amazed, as the events that happen seem purely like the stuff that you see in the movies. How much of it is real and how much of it is purely to make it a better movie, a fight involving Statham I am certain didn&apos;t happen. The performances are surprisingly well rounded, Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. Alas the movie does start to fall apart under close inspection, the plot is never concluded quite as well as I would have liked, and the movie does have some long stretches where not a lot is happening. If you can overlook this fact then you will a lot to enjoy in this very well made movie.\n\nSo onto the performances. As I have said Statham does a surprisingly admirable job in the film. When you look at his CV of films you realise he isn&apos;t exactly the most talented actor. In fact all he generally has to do is grumble and hit things a lot. But there is just no denying that the man has a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he truly gets to display his acting skills. Of course on occasion he delivers a dodgy line, but then if you watch some of the smaller scenes with his characters wife you realise how much potential he has. If given the right material I am sure Statham can truly develop as an actor. Saffron Burrows is brilliant as the slightly suspicious Martine for the first half, unfortunately after the heist she has little to do and the character never felt fully concluded. Still she does have some great moments in the earlier part of the film. Daniel Mays runs off with the majority of the movie as Dave, in fact this looks set to launch Mays career a bit further, he has the best lines and is a funny character. Richard Lintern (who I have to confess I thought was Dougray Scott for half the film) is brilliant as the man behind the heist, in some way that is, and his character is one of the most rounded. Peter De Jersey as Michael X is menacing in his all too brief screen time, but like Martine his character never felt fully dealt with. Still he and the other chief villain, David Suchet, are quite menacing.\n\nThe Bank Job when advertised does come across as a typical gangster flick with a lot of humour in it. However when watching it I have to be honest and say it isn&apos;t that funny. There are a couple of lines here and there but the movie doesn&apos;t really make you laugh that much. Neither is it that big of a gangster flick, of course there are the local gangster running around, and the movie becomes more along that line towards the end. But for the majority of the film it comes across as a slightly grittier and far less flashy Ocean&apos;s Eleven. The scenes where they try to rob the bank are definitely some of the highlights, however its the final 45 minutes that stick firmly in mind. What happens after the robbery is just thrilling to watch, will they get away with it, won&apos;t they? Things also get a lot darker near the end, also quite violent one scene, or the idea of what was going to happen, made me wince a bit. The film is superbly directed as well, its not too flashy but there are some great shots in there. Unfortunately the music does start to irritate after a while, everything seems overdone, a scene which is meant to be funny is ruined because the music sounds like its from an action movie, it just doesn&apos;t truly suit the film all the time. Also as previously mentioned the beginning as well is quite boring.\n\nOverall The Bank Job is a great movie that with a bit of fine tuning at the beginning could make it even better. If you want a smart thriller that will surprise you because of it being based on real events that I highly recommend this. Don&apos;t expect an all time classic though.",

From the creatively artistic mind of Victor Nunez, this modern gem exemplifies the telling details of a coming of age story that expertly portrays the meaning of identity and freedom. From the vibrantly resonating breakout role of Ashley Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing, this modern artifact of a film ages to a perfectly resounding message for today&apos;s modern society. In her breakout role, Judd masterfully illustrates her character&apos;s individualistic and determined identity. Ruby&apos;s development throughout the film is a positively courageous message for all to hear; with its loud undertones of the feminist identity and of self-discovery, Ruby in Paradise is an old flame that can rekindle a sense of discovery for all."

      "name": "West German War Drama with Ruth LEUWERIK and Hansjörg FELMY",
      "reviewBody": "War melodrama with Ruth Leuwerik and Hansjörg Felmy\n\nAlmost a year after his ACADEMY AWARD nomination for &quot;Helden&quot; (1958) with GOLDEN GLOBE nominee Liselotte Pulver and O. W. Fischer, director Franz Peter Wirth premiered this film in Munich&apos;s Gloria-Palast. The Divina film was produced by the great Ilse Kubaschewski and filming took place in the Bavaria Studios in Geiselgasteig and in Galway, Ireland. When I was in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland, in 1991, the city still had the flair that is also expressed in the film.\n\nIn 1943, a German submarine captain ends up shipwrecked on the west coast of neutral Ireland and tries to get help on land. He pretends to be Swiss in order to avoid further complications. However, they do exist. He falls in love with an American woman (Ruth Leuwerik), whose husband was killed in a German attack. Her admirer (Hannes Messemer, second fiddle again!), an American officer, becomes suspicious. How will the woman being courted behave? Will the German captain (from beautiful Hanover!) succeed in helping his team?\n\nQuestions upon questions! You can already tell that the plot isn&apos;t very believable. But played brilliantly! Ruth Leuwerik (&quot;Darling of the Gods&quot;) drives a horse-drawn carriage and runs a village shop with Disney characters on the wall. And Hansjörg Felmy plays, as usual, powerfully and sensitively, and is therefore a completely different type of man than one is usually used to in West German post-war films.\n\nIn other roles, Mady Rahl (&quot;Night fell over Gotenhafen&quot;) with red-dyed hair (Ireland!) Karl Lieffen and Wolfgang Völz (Käpt&apos;n Blaubär) convince as a police officer.\n\nCertainly not the best film by Ruth Leuwerik, the superstar of the German film industry of the 1950s, but her outstanding screen presence makes even a weaker film a great pleasure.",

      "reviewBody": "Few people can so fully express themselves with words as those most adept with a musical instrument. The harshest, and most convincing  critique that I ever saw of Soviet-style communism (I have read Doctor Zhivago and the Gulag Archipelago, thank you!) upon those who avoided its lethal terrors that I ever saw was in liner notes for a set of the Bach cello suites by Mstislav Rostropovich (a fellow now about as old as Rubinstein was when he appeared in Love of Life) -- written by Rostropovich himself, arguing that the fault with Marxism-Leninism was its exaggerated valuation of the material world. Everything material eventually becomes junk unless some person has imbued it with undeniable genius -- a fact that ML could never recognize due to its blindness. Rubinstein was fortunate enough to escape the worst fate possible only because of his greatness as a pianist, but even his powers as a pianist could not spare many of those that he loved, including all of his Jewish family.   \n\nThis documentary shows the great Artur Rubinstein one who could express himself almost as as adeptly in words as in music. If you don&apos;t understand why I give that qualification, then go to a classical music section of a decent record store and buy any recording of Rubinstein&apos;s performances. Anything! Some pianists have shown greater talent for musical pyrotechnics than he, but nobody could put a personality on Mozart, Brahms, Beethoven, or especially Chopin as could Rubinstein. It&apos;s almost as if those great composers had written their music for a pianist that they had never seen and never could have met. What a miracle!\n\nRubinstein, then in his early eighties, was still a formidable figure in music. It&apos;s only in extreme age that many musicians reach the apex of the refinement of their ability to get the most powerful expressions from the piano, the violin, the cello, or the orchestra, becoming (like the semi-mythical Merlin) younger and fresher as they age.\n\nWe have an insight into the person, but only if we can get this\n\ntestimony to his musical and verbal eloquence. Please, someone -- re-release this essential document!",

Its genre is often hard to watch but at the same time you will also be able to appreciate the visual beauty and delicateness of the movie.\n\nOut of all the movies I have seen so far that can be put under the same label as &quot;Môjû&quot;, this movie is certainly one of the better ones. Its storytelling shock you more than the actual images of the movie and visually it&apos;s also a great looking movie with grand and unusual looking sets. It&apos;s definitely an artistic movie but it&apos;s story will still grab everyone, no matter how simplistic it and odd it all gets at times.\n\nEven though in essence its a sadomasochism movie, the movie is more focused on its psychological sexual aspects and how the characters experience them. There is nudity and gore but that is not just simply what the movie is supposed to be all about.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely a movie you simply need to experience. A lot can be written about it but it in no way can capture the essence and mood of the movie.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Travelling from New York ca. 1830 to the Appalachians to claim an `estate&apos;, Keaton on this journey provides the highlight of the film-and what a highlight it is!  From the bouncing actions of passengers to the lifting and moving of track, this series of images is non-stop pleasure.  A dog, a hobo, a man throwing rocks at the engineer, a mule-all are inspired catalysts to laughter.\n\nOnce Keaton (a McKay) reaches his destination, the movie changes pace. And despite many good moments, especially those when Keaton has taken up `permanent residence&apos; at the Canfields, the humor never reaches the level of the first portion of the film.  Nonetheless, Keaton&apos;s genius is evident throughout the film, and it is this ability to innovate that constantly amazes.",

      "reviewBody": "My mother grew up in the East Texas oil boom in 1935. This film closely resembles Kilgore Texas. My whole family has been in the business since the early 40&apos;s. My father was burned in an oil field explosion and recovered. The film was done well, showing all of the hard work men endured in the fields. This movie is true and correct showing the hardships of the life in the business, from being dirt poor to having the finer things in life. All of the actor&apos;s in this movie closely resemble people we have dealt with over the years. I also enjoyed seeing this move in black and white as it focused on the story line rather than a big color feature. I will definitely watch this move again as it brings home the people that risked there lives to bring a product to the people at the beginning of the industrial age with romance and a little humor. I would recommend it to anyone."

Appreciated the story line and felt that there was a real continuity from beginning to end. With a hint of sexuality and the lack of explicit sex (T&amp;A..cheap grab for movie watchers)it kept you from being deterred from the story and only seemed to add to the suspense. The action scenes were well directed and most of the effects were pulled off well. This was an enjoyable independent horror flick that deserves credit and will hopefully be given the chance by other horror fans to be viewed and enjoyed."

      "name": "This  Paella/Spaghetti Western is filled  with action , thrills , intrigue and crossfire",
      "reviewBody": "Spaghetti/Chorizo Western with the most successful intervention by secondary idol Fernando Sancho. This is the original installment from Gemma-Tessari trilogy formed by ¨A pistol for Ringo¨, ¨The return of Ringo¨ and ¨Kiss, Kiss , Bang , Bang¨ , though the later is set in modern times and deal with a heist . All of them are amusing and entertaining and starred by similar cast as Gemma , Fernando Sancho , Lorella De Luca , Nieves Navarro and Antonio Casas ; furthermore same artistic equipment . They are familiar films , in fact , the actress Lorella De Luca married director Duccio Tessari and Nieves Navarro married the producer Luciano Ercoli . This is the second part from Duccio Tessari trilogy , starred by an awesome Giuliano Gemma . It&apos;s a tremendously exciting story of an ex-soldier named Ringo who had only one more killing to go . Ringo (credited as Montgomery Wood) is a civil war soldier who goes back to his familiar land to find his family decimated, his senator father was killed , his manor taken over by a bunch of Mexican bandits named Esteban ( Fernando Sancho) and Paco Fuentes (Jorge Martin) and his fiancée ( Lorella De Luca) about to marry the nasty Mexican behind all this . Ringo (Giuliano Gemma) is spending time in discover the schemes the bandits . Once again Ringo seeks vengeance , he goes undercover disguised as a Mexican beggar and learns he has a daughter . Meanwhile , the gang of a nasty Mexican named Esteban (Fernando Sancho) and his bandits occupy a mansion and take the ranch and its inhabitants . The local Sheriff (Antonio Casas) gets no option but to send in Ringo. Ringo goes the ranch against Fuentes&apos;s hoodlums who kill and mistreat countrymen . Ringo comes to the ranch just in time to make sure its inhabitants and rescue his lover , taking place a cat and mouse game , but later the events get worse .\n\nThis Western is superior than subsequent outing because it displays thrills , emotion, shoot&apos;em up , intrigue and is pretty amusing . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shots or stunts every few minutes . This is a good S.W. plenty of action , shootouts , fist-play and without touches of humor as in previous entry . Ringo is stunningly played by Gemma . Giuliano is very fine, he ravages the screen , he jumps , bounds and leaps, hit and run ; plus jokes , laughs , he&apos;s a complete show . Fernado Sancho as a cruelly baddie role as Mexican bandit is terrific , subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis . In the movie appears usual support actors as Spanish : George Martin , Antonio Casas , Pajarito as Italian players as Zamperla and Frank Oliveras . Special mention to Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott as attractive and rogue woman but she unfortunately would finish shooting erotic cinema . It&apos;s a co-production Spanish-Italian and shot on location in Fraga , Huesca , Spain that is well photographed by Francisco Marin , though is necessary a fine remastering because the film-copy is washed-out .¨Fraga¨ resulted to be the location where were shot lots of Western produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J.J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch, Ignacio F. Iquino and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler , he creates a magnificent scenario on the interior ranch and barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets filmed in Fraga and ,PC Alfonso Balcazar Studios, Barcelona and San Jose, Andalucia, Spain . As always , the musician Ennio Morricone, composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted and splendid leitmotif ; it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and emotive score , including enjoyable songs at the beginning and the end.\n\nThis Italian writer / filmmaker Duccio Tessari so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . He wrote several Western as ¨A fistful of dollars ¨, ¨A train to Durango ¨Seven guns for McGregor¨ , ¨The return of McGregor¨ . He directed five Western as ¨Tex e Il Signore degli abissi¨ and with abundant touches of humor as ¨Vivi o Preferibilment Morti¨, ¨Don&apos;t turn the other cheek¨ and ¨Zorro¨ with Alain Delon and of course ¨Ringo ¨and sequel , mostly starred with his fetish actor Giuliano Gemma . Tessari directed all kind of genres as drama , adventure , wartime as ¨1981 Un Centesimo Di second ,1978 Das Fünfte Gebot ,1976 La Madama ,1976 Safari Express , 1973 Tony Arzenta ,1973 Los Héroes Millonarios ,1972 Forza &apos;G&apos;, 1968 I Bastardi¨. Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable movie that will appeal to Spaghetti Western buffs .",

      "reviewBody": "Watching this film the last time, some 45 years ago, upon it&apos;s original UK release, I was blown away. I felt I had never seen such beautiful sunny summer images, I was astonished at the use of posters and advertising hoardings for composition. I notice now that some of these aspects have coloured my own photographic sensitivities. I remember the film as one long celebration of happiness and the suggestion that with the right attitude life would be like this. Seeing it again, it is still undoubtedly beautiful and I possibly appreciate even more the wonderful cinematography, however, now I notice how subversive this movie is. I have a feeling that this is very much a personal film seen through Varda&apos;s eyes and she is suggesting that a woman might easily do as the second woman does in this without causing so much as a head to turn. I think not, this is fantasy. The guy is unreal, men don&apos;t lie around saying how happy they are all the time, never mind the way he fails to be affected by the incident. I imagine at the time I saw this as a depiction of a real possibility. I seem to remember thinking lots of things were possible in the 60s that have turned out not to be. Nevertheless, this is still a beautiful movie,",

However, this film challenged me in a whole new way. ANATOMY OF HELL is a film that challenged my stomach. The film tells the tale of a woman who asks a gay man to poke around and look into her labia. Does this sound pleasant? Well, considering that Catherine Breillat directed it, don&apos;t expect it to be anything east to watch. In fact, this is probably her hardest film to watch. I sat through FAT GIRL, ROMANCE, and BRIEF CROSSING, but I was unable to sit through ANATOMY OF HELL. The film grossed me right out. Yes, we do get some extreme close ups of the labia and it&apos;s uses and it&apos;s complexities, but we have our faces shoved into it so much that at some point we do become terrified. It is this part of the human body that is so intricate and unique. It is where all life begins. However, it is such an unpleasant and horrific thing to look at that the audience will grow rather unnerved by the whole thing and most people will not be able to take it and will turn it off or leave the theater. So Catherine Breillat has, in the end, outdone herself. She has now made a film that is too challenging. I don&apos;t regret seeing what I saw, but in the end I don&apos;t wish anybody else to watch it."

      "reviewBody": "This is not flawless filmmaking, but it IS flawless cinema. One won&apos;t bother recounting the story, or the plotline, a viewer can gather that from history, OR previous reviews, OR even a casual overview of Dumas novels. One would like to speak to the filmmaking here, and along the way, on the movie.\n\nIf one is at all interested in French history, one has already seen this movie a thousand* times, * meaning enough. However, a digital dvd transfer of the movie as it was originally intended to be seen by M. Chéreau, without subtitles, without interference,the VO [version originale] is stunning. The first and foremost difference is the lighting - il te frappe, as the French would say, &quot;it strikes you.&quot; Not being a technician, one can&apos;t speak to the difference between the film one saw on DVD and the film one saw in American theaters, or on American DVD, or even on VHS, French and/or American. The difference is striking. From the opening scenes, one is suddenly, almost frightfully, drawn into the 16th century, an epoch without the cushions of modern life. The light is everywhere, and it shines in a way that is pitiless and revelatory. This was never, unfortunately, appparent to theater goers here, and, I suspect, to cinema goers in France. If it had been, there would have been Oscars. One is not sure cinema projection equipment can convey what M. Chéreau did with this film. Where there is light, there is &quot;liminality&quot; and where there are shadows, even there there is light, but it is dim (thus not liminal), and the cadaverous flesh of the living players conveys more than anyone could ever say in dialogue - these are &quot;dead&quot; people, living out a drama that is already predestined for them, which is a marvelously conceived conceit of the filmmaker. M. Chéreau is playing with predestination and Fate here, and it is through the art of cinema that he is doing it. Mlle Adjani turns in a bravura performance, and it is only by grace of Jeanne Moreau&apos;s 1954 performance that we have any scale of comparison. Moreau&apos;s performance is cool, ice and politics, but Adjani&apos;s is heat, love and politics, and suited to her generation. Vincent Perez is suitably heroic (watch the rose tones come and go on his flesh as the light changes). The kudos for male performances, however, are shared by Jean-Hugues Anglade, long an underrated French actor, and Daniel Auteuil, too long appreciated for his bravura performances elsewhere and not given enough credit for what he can do with a gesture, with a line, with a look. M. Auteuil is almost always lit with cool hypocrisy, (ambers and greens) as suits his performance, but M. Anglade turns in one of the best roles of his career as the doomed Charles IX, and he never looks less than &quot;on death&apos;s door.&quot; A naturally sensitive actor, he adds a touch of &quot;soullessness&quot; to his Charles IX that is unforgettable - weak, yes, king, yes, momma&apos;s boy, yes, but also, in the end, needy child. It is stunning in its ultimate simplicity as a performance for cinema. Very few performances in film measure up to Virna Lisi&apos;s Catherine de Medici(s) [the s is French spelling]. She is &quot;incroyable&quot; (incredible), and something was wrong when she wasn&apos;t recognized universally as &apos;94&apos;s best supporting actress. Her queen is multi-layered, loving, hating, deeply cynical yet naively superstitious, playing son against son and daughter against political reality, in other words a perfect incarnation of the 16th century in France. Any political woman you can think of could have sat at her feet and learned lessons on &quot;how to do it.&quot; Mme Lisi herself might have been a confidante to the real Catherine, she is that good in this role. She was crowned for this performance in Europe, but should have been crowned universally. Watch her as she vacillates between love and hate and politics, and especially watch the lighting - it subtly changes according to her role of the moment. Watch her carefully towards the end, as Fate winds things up, and watch an actress give herself up totally to the role, to the moment, in order to incarnate a character that is absolutely unforgettable.\n\nApparently, M. Chéreau lets his actors know what he is doing, because they respond in according &quot; shades&quot; of emotion. When the lighting is dim, or the focus is midrange, they &quot;fuzz&quot; a little, giving the viewer a sense of their uncertainty, but if he focuses, they focus, too, and there are frightening moments of soul-baring intimacy when you almost want to look away - it is like watching your intimates make love; too much, too intimate, too deep. Dominique Blanc turns in a nearly flawless performance as the over-the-top lady-in-waiting to Margot - watch her lighting, too, and how she responds. &quot;Conspiratrice&quot;, duchesse, cynical woman in love despite herself, she is very, very good. Pascal Greggory as the future Henri III is wonderful, and the rest of the cast stand out. This was obviously a labor of love and intensity, and all gave their best to M. Chéreau.\n\nIn the end, one keeps wondering what it is about the film that was so memorable - and the french dvd transfer makes it perfectly clear. The performances, yes; the &quot;mise en scène,&quot; yes; the director, certainly. But it is the whole, the light and the shadows, the darkness and the glow, as in those candles in the marvelous square paper lanterns in the late night of the Louvre as the people begin to weave their plots, that make it memorable. Good actors, great performances, and a sure director - flawless cinema."

The direction which was made by Nikos Koutelidakis was exceptional and he succeeded on presenting the differences of his main characters. The interpretations of Giannis Bezos who played as Colonel Manolis Loggos, Vicky Papadopoulou who played as Zoi Loggou, Giannis Stankoglou who played as Lieutenant Stefanos Karamanidis and Antinoos Albanis who played as Private Lazaros Lazarou were simply amazing and their combination worked very well. Lastly, I have to say that &quot;The Christmas Tango&quot; is an interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "of Jean Michel Basquiat and the art world of the 80&apos;s. Granted, the film is a bit abstruse, and some viewers have complained about the music tracks (actually Basquiat&apos;s own music from his band); but it does serve to show the disaffected life of an artist, who seemed to gain fame, money, and fair-weather friends, despite himself.\n\nJeffrey Wright is very understated, but believable as Basquiat. Apparently he and his father were estranged, until he became famous. Then everyone wanted something from him. Not just another story of fame and its vices, however; because the film does NOT show his life as glamorous, indeed once he has &quot;made it&quot; we still see him dining at Lutece, people critiquing, being unaccepting of him as a person. Perhaps in real life this was one of the sources of his insecurities, and reason for his drug addiction. Certainly, if one believes even half of what is written about the NY art world- it cannot have been a forgiving place.\n\nThat aside, the film also has some interesting cameos, David Bowie as Warhol is excellent, Dennis Hopper as the Zurich art dealer, Bruno Bischofsburger is very believable. An amusing cameo with Christopher Walken as a James Lipton character; a pretentious interviewer. The only annoying performance was Parker Posey, as gallery owner Mary Boone, who perhaps portrayed this person too close to the mark.\n\nKeeping in mind that Basquiat was under age 30 when he died, this story is credible. An artist who rose too fast, was used and discarded- apparently in real life Basquiat had a tendency to be generous, and gave away many of his paintings. There is one scene where he is beaten up so two street people can take steal a &quot;SAMO&quot; inscription on a piece of metal.\n\nThe visuals are also noteworthy, while an earlier review critiqued the surfboarding sequence, I find that a preferable segue to Basquiat&apos;s need to escape; apparently he owned a good deal of property in Hawai&apos;i and spent time there as well.\n\nThe scenes with Claire Forlani are also effective, Basquiat&apos;s some-time girlfriend, we see her as a waitress, then a junkie, then a cleaned-up version, going to Columbia. The NY street sequences are realistic, It is not glamorous (though the accompanying jazz music is). It shows the schizophrenic nature of NY; Lutece, a homeless person sleeping outside, a man selling stuffed animals on the street, and Bruno Bischofsberger(Hopper) who mistakes Basquiat for a homeless person, trying to clean the windows on his Mercedes. Very realistic.\n\nI highly recommend this film; it does not glamorize the story, and while it may not be completely accurate, it rings true, and portrays a life many artists may wish for, until they get it. 9/10",

Juliusz Machulski was always one of my all-time favorite directors, especially with his Va Bank films, but here he proved that he still hasn&apos;t lost his touch and remains in the cohorts of the Polish living classics. Vinci is a typically Polish comedy, with excellent Slavic humor, twisting plot and hilarious characters. The plot seems to be so simple - some crooks want to steal a Vinci picture and then there are so many other criminals who also want to lay their hands on the work of art. What is great here is the vivid performance of Machulski in the role of an old but still effective thief, who can do everything to fool other crooks down and to get his share of money. The picturesque views of Krakow, excellent playing, funny dialogs all add to the picture. Do not search for the sky-high sense or extremely serious ideas. This is entertainment in its clearest sense. But what a clever work!",

Goring: So my mother tells me.\n\nEven if was concocted for the film, that line still contains the essence of Wilde and the essence of all modern British humor, for which, I should say, I&apos;m a major sucker.  While watching An Ideal Husband, I didn&apos;t object to the lack of suspense as long as Rupert Everett was working his way around those Wilde lines, which he does as well as anyone I&apos;ve ever heard.\n\nI used to think Stephen Fry was Wilde on earth, but Fry is something wonderfully different -- Everett is Wilde on earth, or at least the actor that Wilde should have had around to deliver those lines when he wrote them. I first saw Everett in The Madness of King George, for which he put on weight.  Every review of that film mentioned this; I thought the attention excessive,  but when I saw him lying shirtless in a sauna, I understood. The man is, shall we say, cut.  I can only imagine the effect of that scene on straight women or gay men -- probably something akin to the effect Greta Scacchi&apos;s &quot;I think we&apos;re alone now&quot; smile at the end of The Coca-Cola Kid has on me.\n\nAn Ideal Husband is full of good performances, with one glaring exception: the usually great Julianne Moore.  Her scenes are curiously leaden, and Parker -- whose fault this may be -- has the camera linger over her as though the exposure will convince us how evil she is.  The one exception is her scene with Everett, which has a real &quot;Will he sleep with the enemy?&quot; tension.  It may be that Moore was just outclassed by the Brits, who are born to this stuff.\n\nCate Blanchett, whom I&apos;ve seen in three movies, two of which were British period pieces, continues to amaze me with her range.\n\nThe unsung hero of the movie is Jeremy Northam, who takes a thankless role -- the man in the play who isn&apos;t the Oscar Wilde figure -- and makes it emotionally compelling.  He is responsible for the play&apos;s only real suspense and emotion, since the rest is word games, more or less.\n\nAll of which leads me to blame the production&apos;s shortcomings on its writer/director, Oliver Parker.  He seems to have squandered an outstanding cast.  The play&apos;s final scene is played as a series of French scenes -- a film term for a series of different scenes in the same location -- and this kills any momentum that scene might have had.\n\nThree out of four stars, I say, which makes it better than 90% of the movies out there."

      "name": "Action , suspense and entertainment with a band of escaped WWII  POW  fighting nasty  Nazis",
      "reviewBody": "It is well set in 1944 France . Five convict soldiers (Peter Hooten, Fred Williamson , Basehart , Pergolani) in WWII French territory led to martial court escape from lock-up and head to Switzerland . They are commanded by a con-lieutenant (Bo Svenson) . They , then , mistakenly attack an allied command suited as Nazis . Shortly after , the motley gang assigned by an Allied colonel (Ian Bannen) pull off a daring assault on a Nazi-held stronghold , the most heavily guarded base . To add intrigue , a female (Debra Berger) and French resistance (Michel Constantine) have joined the ranks of the rag-tag , tough outfit ; besides , a rebel Nazi (Raimund Harmstorf) has also infiltrated the band . After that , they participate on a suicidal task to thwart the Nazi schemes by blowing up a train containing V2 head-rockets in a decisive battle for winning the war .\n\nThe movie packs noisy action , slow motion explosion , shootouts , bombing and results to be quite amusing . It&apos;s well-made war-action/thriller/adventure/ Eurotrash film , it is a standout in its genre : ¨The Spaghetti-Italian warlike¨ . Relentless plot twists , in spite of some flaws , the warlike action keeps you breathless ; dealing with a peculiar band to steal the Nazi&apos;s most precious military hardware , and bring it back to the allies without getting arrested again by their own side . Rough , elegant Bo Svenson is fine as the group leader of the motley pack , he leads the misfit band of crooks from behind enemy lines . Remainder cast formed by Fred Williamson , Michel Constantine , Debra Berger (William Berger&apos;s daughter) , Enzo G. Castell himself in a brief cameo and Peter Hooten as an assassin convict are nice . The film takes part from American classic movies , just like :¨Dirty dozen¨ , ¨Kelly&apos;s heroes¨ and ¨ Where the eagles dare¨ but is actually its origin an Italian movie in similar plot , titled ¨ Hell commandos¨ (1969) . \n\nInglorious bastards¨ had a special remake directed by Quentin Tarantino , in fact several scenes had to be re-scripted and/or shot differently as during filming the Italian Government, in response to increasing activity by the terrorist Red Brigade, drafted a law prohibiting the holding of weapons in case they fell into Red Brigade hands . The castle rescue scenes originally featured a massive shoot out, but were rewritten into the covert attack and escape featured, using knives, catapults and crossbows instead of firearms . The picture was professionally directed by Enzo Girolami Castellari who previously had made another good war film : ¨Eagles over London¨ . Besides , Enzo usually worked with Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson (who is even named as a co-writer on screenplay on deposit at the Copyright Office) in Italian ¨B¨ films such as : ¨Delta Force commando¨ ,¨Deadly impact¨, ¨ Tides of war¨ ,¨Bronx warriors¨, and ¨Warriors of the wasteland¨ .",

      "reviewBody": "It was well known that in the late 60&apos;s, famed Italian director Federico Fellini experiment with LSD. That&apos;s why &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; was so bizarre and colorful. But the 1969 head trip &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot; was even stranger than previous Fellini films. Loosely based on the novel by Petronius, the beginning of the story concerns two men in the B.C. Roman era fighting over the love of one boy. Later they have many strange and colorful misadventures. This film may be to bizarre for some; with its grotesque images, a mild orgy, dwarfs and even a hermaphrodite goddess. The set pieces are out of this world. It&apos;s like being caught in a two hour dream. Many times I had no idea what was going on, but that didn&apos;t bother me. Satyricon is a visual decadent head trip of color. Fellini considered this film a sci-fi of the past. I consider Fellini a genius; he&apos;s designed a film that makes a great substitute for drugs. If you enjoy &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot; you should also watch Vera Chytilova&apos;s &quot;Daisies&quot; (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky&apos;s &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1973), Guy Maddin&apos;s &quot;Careful&quot; (1992) and Tsui Hark&apos;s &quot;Green Snake&quot;. All of these film contain bright colors and surreal images. Enjoy!",

      "name": "Ordinary Spaghetti with Gialli elements , including greedy antiheroes , violent facing off , quick zooms , and exaggerated baddies",
      "reviewBody": "Spaghetti Western crammed with intrigue , murders , lots of fights , crossfire , twists and turns . An Italian production full of action , extreme characters, shootouts and loads of violence . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up , brawls , or stunts every few minutes . There&apos;s also an interesting intrigue and whodunit with some Giallo when happens a killing spree , and the question is : Who is the killer ? For money, for pleasure, for revenge, he doesn&apos;t care why he kills or how ¡ . A slaughter and atrocity is committed when four people carry out a hold-up and they are killed at a saloon robbing . The townspeople pin the murderers on local no-count black sheep Chester Conway (Klaus Kinski) , subsequently condemned to gallows . As an unknown killer executes a single-handedly revenge , ravages and murders each person involved in dark events . Gunfighter Silver (Gianni Garco) is hired by lawyer Jeff Plummer (Franco) who doesn&apos;t believe that Chester is guilty of these crimes, to prove that his client Conway, is innocent of the saloon heist he&apos;s condemned to hang for. Silver is relentless in his mission , deadly in his hard investigation and he vows to take down the uncanny killer . Along the way there occurs more and more murders , the body count piles up and the clock ticks down to the day when the scapegoat about to go scaffold . He&apos;d kill anyone for a price, but he&apos;d kill one man for free !\n\n It is a moving western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Gianni Garco and his nasty enemies . It packs thrills , shoot-outs , violence , hooded murderers , nutty townfolk and resulting to be slightly entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . There is enough action in the movie , guaranteeing some pursuits , fights in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style , gunfire or stunts every few minutes . It is an acceptable , passable Western with several titles as La mano nascosta di Dio (Italy) , The Price of Death (Canada, English title) , La vengeance de Dieu (France) , Le prix de la mort (France) , Persecución mortal (Spain) that contains an interesting and twisted plot about an investigator gunman who starts piecing together the facts and finds out a terrible truth about some grisly killings , and , subsequently takes place the unavoidable final duel . It is a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist against the heartless enemies . The film blends violence , blood , tension , high body-count and quite entertaining thanks to the intriguing events . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the final gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion . There are many fine technicians and nice production design , though mostly set at a little town shot in Elios studios , as usual . Stars Gianni Garco who gives a decent acting as the smooth and suave gunslinger Silver hired to prove Chester&apos;s innocence and find the real killer while he pieces together tracks . His role a bears remarkable resemblance to Sartana , as his character in equal parts mysterious , cool and deadly ; he shows up elegantly dressed and with a brilliant look , he is not out there to chase the bandits like a simple bounty hunter , he is just out for money and blood . His quirky gadgets often bring to mind the other similar role , Sabata , who starred Lee Van Cleef . Garco played a lot of Spaghetti , such as : Have a Good Funeral, My Friend... Sartana Will Pay , Per 100.000 dollari t&apos;ammazzo , 10,000 dollari per un massacro , Bad man river , Et.... Sabata les tua tous ,Sartana arrives ,His Name Was Holy Ghost , Taste of Vengeance , 7 Chacales , Those Dirty Dogs , and several others . Co-stars the popular Klaus Kinski as a suspicious man locked in prison and about to be hanged , at the time he gained a reputation for his ferocious talent and equally ferocious temper . Here he plays with lots of gesticulation and excessive gestures in a cruelly baddie role . As he is fine , as he ravages the screen with his peculiar face and using suddenly his weapons at the inevitable ending gundown . As Kinski starred numerous Spaghetti such as : Pray to Kill and Return Alive , Black Killer , If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death , Bullet King , Shangai Joe , Clint the solitary , The Ruthless Four , Nevada Kid , The return of Clint , and specially famous resulted to be his acting in ¨For a fistful of dollars more¨.This Spaghetti is made during his Italian period when Klaus starred a lot of Westerns , later he collaborated with Werner Herzog with whom played several prestigious films . They later collaborated on five movies : Aguirre (1972), Woyzeck (1979), Nosferatu, (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982) and Cobra Verde (1987). Furthermore, there appears briefly usual Italian Western secondaries , such as : Giancarlo Prete or Timothy Brent , Andrea Scotti , Fortunato Arena , Alfredo Rizzo ,Pietro Torrisi , Castellano and Luciano Pigozzi or Alan Collins nicknamed the Italian Peter Lorre .\n\nThe motion picture was regularly directed by Lorenzo Gicca Palli . He was an artisan who directed a few films , such as : Giorni di sangue Primo tango a Roma... storia d&apos;amore e d&apos;alchimia , Lieber Lager , Black Corsair and wrote a lot of screenplays about all kinds of genres : Thriller , Wartime , Peplum , adventure , action , such as : La sfida dei giganti , Una voglia da moriré , Objective Rommel , Tiger of Kyber , Silenzio: Si uccide , and especially Spaghetti Western : La strada per Forte Alamo , La morte sull&apos;alta collina , Zorro Monterrey , Last adventure Zorro , Giorni di sangue , Killer calibro 32 , Thompson 1880 , among others . Rating : 5/10 . Average Spaghetti Western but passable .",

Cruchot is searching for his daughter, who is matched up by a tabloidreporter with an Italian policeman. Hilarious are the chases in the cab and at a building construction. A tribute to the Westside story is the scene at the playground, where Cruchot gets involved with some streetgangs. Funes is as always the eyecatcher, but his daughter played by the lovely Genieviève Grad is also very funny. A typical European sixties comedy, with some Hollywood elements. 4 out of 5."

This one is pure soap suds, but just try to look away when these two real-life enemies share the close-ups. \n\nThe two portray authors--one a sensitive, thoughtful woman (Bette Davis), the other a shrewish housewife who writes pulp fiction (Miriam Hopkins). The two share the ups and downs of a rocky relationship when the lesser writer becomes famous for her trash and loses her ignored husband (John Loder). A very young Gig Young provides some romantic interest for Davis--until she sensibly concludes that he is too young for her. At the end, the two women are left facing middle-age together and, as they sit before a roaring fireplace, toast each other to the fadeout strains of Franz Waxman&apos;s music.\n\nAll of this plays like a Cosmopolitan magazine story of the &apos;40s but is made to seem intelligent and likeable by the sheer magnetism of Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, never better than here. Hopkins sinks her teeth into the role of a nasty bitch--and Davis is unusually even-tempered until the scene where she shakes the living daylights out of Hopkins.\n\nForget the 1982 remake directed by George Cukor--like most remakes, it lacked the ingredients that made the original such a treat."

Their commentary truly gets one through it, but also repeatedly reminds me that trusting my instincts on films has always been a good idea.\n\nTo put it perspective this is a year AFTER The Matrix and the same year as Gladiator and Snatch. The worst film I intentionally saw in 2000 was Charlie&apos;s Angels. I rated that a 5 for the same reason someone here rated this a 7. As vapid as Charlie&apos;s Angels and its storyline was, at least it had big name actors and hot actresses, and actual ACTION.\n\nMy goodness, in the year 2000 this film could not have picked a worse bunch of lead actors for bad guys. BRC was bad enough yet he was quite decent and appealing compared to most of the remaining cast. It was like they wanted to make sure the star looked good by picking worse-acting bad guys and a completely unimaginative film location. Wow!\n\nThe production quality, filming style, acting, directing and story content were all at the level of a late 80s, early 90s made-for-TV movie - but in the year 2000! I gave it a 2 because it did have a couple decent actors and the storyline was at least mildly plausible and stayed on track. I&apos;ve seen worse films. Like, maybe 5 or 6. :-/",

She is not well remembered, probably because her career petered out half a dozen years later, when talent whose names are now vaguely remembered, were first becoming well known.\n\nNonetheless, it is a beautifully shot film in half a dozen scenes, showing the whale-like airship to best advantage.",

Sheen&apos;s current girlfriend (Courtney Thorne-Smith) does not care for this development as it is obvious to her what is happening. Band member Winona Ryder likes Haim, but Haim is oblivious to her completely. Haim will do most anything to get Green so he decides to quit band and play football instead, thinking that will be the way to win her heart for good. A good teen film overall that plays more like a soap opera than anything else. Really funny at times, but also highly dramatic as well. All this makes the film uneven to an extent, but the messages it tries to go for make it a competent work anyway. 3.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "IKARIE XB-1 is one of the most compelling science fiction films ever made. Filmed in very Cold War era Czecheslovokia and rarely seen in North America in it&apos;s complete widescreen form, this is a movie that was so ahead of it&apos;s time that only 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY managed to raise the bar above what was set here with it&apos;s meticulous depiction of outer space vehicles in action.\n\nIf there is any shortcoming to IKARIE it&apos;s simply that: The space ship model effects are somewhat awkward &amp; unconvincing, a setback that the movie might not recover from in the mind&apos;s eye of viewers raised on 30+ years of George Lucas &amp; Steven Spielberg special effects films. But viewers who are interested in a story will be more than rewarded with a complex drama about a group of humans off in search of a brave new world to populate, with an ending sequence that is perhaps the most provocative element of the entire film -- and would later find form again in Mario Bava&apos;s PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, albeit in a different manner. There is no doubt that the Italian master was influenced by this film.\n\nFor me the most striking sequence is a daring, risky, and potentially scandalous commentary by these Soviet Bloc filmmakers when they have their explorers encounter a derelict craft floating aimlessly &amp; without power in the empty nothing between the stars. A boarding party is dispatched to discover that it was an early Earth craft which had been dispatched during a nuclear conflict who&apos;s crew was made up of decadent aristocrats who had been attempting to escape the carnage back on Earth. They are long dead, mummified to the point where their bodies disintegrate when brushed against, and had apparently been killed off by the military flight crew when it became clear the oxygen supply was about to run dry. The quiet, calm horror of the scene is unprecedented even by today&apos;s standards, with the accidental triggering of one of the ship&apos;s obsolete but still functional nuclear warheads providing a nerve-shattering moment as the two hapless crewmen attempt to escape the airless, gravity deprived hell in space.\n\nOne of the aspects that makes the scene so convincing was the space suit designs created by the artistic visionaries behind the film. They look even more functional, practical and &quot;real&quot; than the Mercury era space flight technology of the day: Bulky, armored, pressurized tin cans with knee joints, claw-like cloves, and magnetized boot plates. The scene of the two astronauts trying to run across the derelict flight deck for the airlock to escape the explosion is a marvel of not only applied science but choreography. In my opinion the film is worth tracking down for this one sequence alone.\n\nAnd now you can: The film was issued in 2005 on a marvelous Czech made PAL format DVD that shows the film in the correct 2:35:1 Techniscope widescreen format with the original, unaltered &amp; un-messed with ending sequence intact. Any serious fan of Cold War era science fiction simply must acquire one. I will admit that some of the more talky middle &quot;soap opera in space&quot; segments sort of lag the pacing a bit, but the 81 minutes is over quickly and the impression one is left with is that the thinking behind the movie was miles ahead of anything that came out of the West at the same time. Along with the Russian PLANETA BUR and the East German/Polish SILENT STAR aka FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS, this is one of the most important &amp; overlooked masterpieces of science fiction from the time when manned space flight was becoming a reality.\n\nAll three films are grounded in actual science with impressive visual power that still has potency. What makes IKARIE XB-1 even more impressive is that it lacks some of the glory-boy propagandizing of the Soviet Bloc&apos;s entertainment machine, which was designed to enthrall the masses with depictions of glorious Soviet cosmonauts conquering the cosmos -- something that never really quite happened. Those movies were meant to placate the Proletariat and give them a reason to make do cheer for the genuine oppression under which they lived. By contrast, IKARIE is almost a work of pure artistic expression, which is in itself remarkable considering the conditions under which it was made.\n\n8/10",

This is a brooding film, but I think it does a great job of conveying its more hopeful messages through some stunning photography.",

In a nightclub, she runs into former crush and Naval officer Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). In college, she was a communist student leader struggling to rally against Franco with Frankie McVeigh (James Woods). He was the WASP star athlete, the man around campus, and outwardly lived a carefree life. He&apos;s taken with her tenacity and she admires his writing. In the post war years, they are married in Hollywood where he writes for the studio and she fights against Mcarthyism.\n\nShe has the better part. He&apos;s playing the trophy wife. His hemming and hawing with his writing is a bit infuriating. He&apos;s too cool for school except for a few emotional outbursts. Those are great for showing some depth in his character although the couple seems to have only two polar opposite gears. As for her, Streisand gives it her all. There is a grating edge to her character which is not that appealing. I do like that these two flawed characters struggle with their undeniable connection until I can&apos;t take their unending fight about politics. Another issue is the unchanging Grecian God beauty of Redford&apos;s look. This movie takes place over decades. He needs to change. Maybe give him a buzz cut during the war years. There is the famous song which I wouldn&apos;t diss or praise. Pollack delivers a solid melodrama although the relationship gets too melodramatic at times.",

Here, Crispin shows his serious and comic side. The movie alone holds up as a gritty thriller. A horror movie none-the-less, Willard is an interesting film that we don&apos;t see too often. A well made movie with decent production value, the cast adds to its greatness. Much like River&apos;s Edge, the audience is left wondering where Crispin Glover came from. No longer a young actor, Crispin has worked his way up to become a veteran performer and a good actor.",

As stated the acting isn&apos;t going to win an Oscar, but it decent enough for the budget and script given. The wolves are by far the best part. They are well made and aren&apos;t low budget at all, very good FX department. I would say you want a werewolf movie for the sake of that kind of movie then check this out. Jason plays his character well for this movie, not overly scary but you sure wont love him either. I would like to see a sequel to this that explain the history of the main blood lines and goes into that more. They can recast for that with no issues plot wise, which makes it an excellent jumping off point.",

He became famous all over the World an his books were translated into many languages. I myself posses some of them.\n\nThe title character is perfectly portrait by Bavarian actor Carl Wery. The actor also resembles the real Kneipp a great deal. His harsh character is the source of many conflicts throughout the movie and makes every scene twice as interesting.\n\nA very memorable scene is, when the Austrian Archduke refuses to carry out Kneipp&apos;s instruction and Kneipp coldly tells him: &quot;Then you will die.&quot; Or where he saved a woman, normal doctors have already given up.\n\nI give this piece of film 7 out of 10, and recommend it to everybody, who is able to speak German, because I don&apos;t think it is available in English."

      "reviewBody": "The timing of this film is unfortunate. It came out in October, 1945--several months after the war in Europe had ended. Had it come out during the war, it would have been an excellent propaganda film for the folks at home. Instead, it just seems a bit odd to come out when it did.\n\nAs far as the casting goes, it IS unusual. Constance Bennett plays the lead and over the years she tended to play a variety of rich society ladies. Co-starring is Gracie Fields, a British music hall singer and comedienne. It&apos;s a strange pairing but it worked..particularly since they de-glamorized Bennett for the part.\n\nThe story begins just as France is falling to the Nazis in 1940. An American woman (Bennett) and her companion (Fields) are trapped in Paris. They also accidentally come upon a pilot of a downed British plane...and through this help to create an underground organization which repatriates pilots through the course of the war. Naturally, the Germans are more than a bit anxious to catch them. \n\nThe film&apos;s biggest strength might just be because it came out when it did. Instead of snarly, over-the-top Nazis, the Germans in this one are more believable than ones you would have seen in films just a short time earlier. Plus, a restrained performance by Bennett (one of her better ones actually) help to make this an enjoyable and well made film.",

The most beautiful example of &quot;disastre deluxe&quot; I&apos;ve ever seen - everything is so rundown it&apos;s gorgeous. The music perfectly matches the whole film. The performances are not &quot;realistic&quot;, but they are not meant to be.\n\nThis is obviously not a piece of cinema verite and shouldn&apos;t be reviewed as such. &quot;Diva&quot; is a 2 hour tour de force of cinema as experience. One of the finest films I&apos;ve ever seen."

      "name": "All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...",
      "reviewBody": "There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn&apos;t be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese&apos;s film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane&apos;s already great story.\n\nShutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you&apos;ve read the novel multiple times, you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing &quot;the most dangerous patients,&quot; and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.\n\nI often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall&apos;s The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.\n\nAs with Scorsese and DiCaprio&apos;s previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn&apos;t go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That&apos;s not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility&apos;s faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.\n\nHowever, that mood isn&apos;t sacrificed and &quot;spooky&quot; is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a &quot;best of&quot; collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my &quot;Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows&quot; list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he&apos;s quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn&apos;t mean anything though if you don&apos;t have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn&apos;t among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there&apos;s always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.\n\nWith a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn&apos;t rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.\n\nShutter Island isn&apos;t just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I&apos;ve been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I&apos;ve been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those &quot;in the know.&quot; You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I&apos;ll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in &quot;Spoiler&quot; tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing.",

      "reviewBody": "The Cable Guy has now all but been forgotten by the movie world. It was released when Jim Carrey was on his way to being the new A list comedian, and thus, was considered only a slightly funny version of &apos;Ace Venture&apos;. or The Mask&apos; Or whatever. Personally, I don&apos;t consider The Cable Guy a comedy at all. Sure, there are some side splitting moments - Carrey is hilarious alongside Matthew Broderick&apos;s by the numbers &apos;average Joe&apos;, but id suggest that anyone who was not taken in by this film to look at it a little differently...\n\nThis is a horror film. I swear!\n\nFor me, Chip Douglas does not come across to me as a harmless lisping clingy chump - HELL NO! The guy is a maniac. An obsessive, intelligent, controlling, stalking &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; styled nutter!\n\n Watch it again!\n\nFor me, this is Jim Carrey&apos;s career launching performance. He has a lisp right? after a while, you don&apos;t really notice it do you? Right. This is an incredibly difficult task for an actor - maintaining a speech impediment for an entire film, keeping it level, and not exaggerating it, its really something to take a look at. Carrey&apos;s character is sick, and very very creepy. With Broderick et al giving relatively standard performances, Carrey&apos;s performance is a stand out, and Ben Stiller should be proud of this film and what it lead to in terms of Jim Carrey&apos;s career.\n\nTrust me, if you didn&apos;t like this, take another look, and prepare to be freaked out by a very not funny, very creepy Carrey performance...\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Certainly not one of the great comedies, but charming and rather whimsical in its own way.  In this day and age of raucous and crude humour (if you can call it that), a movie like &quot;Magic Town&quot; will probably seem hopelessly old-fashioned and dated, but for those who prefer a quieter and more gentle humour, &quot;Magic Town&quot; will fill the bill very nicely.  Very Frank Capra-like (not surprisingly since screenwriter Robert Riskin collaborated with Capra numerous times), &quot;Magic Town&quot; reminds us of a by-gone era, a time when living in a small town meant knowing your neighbours, pride in your community, and the moral values of common decency and humility were still part of everyday life.  James Stewart as the pollster who discovers a town full of people whose opinions exactly mirror the national thinking gives his customary good performance, as does Jane Wyman as the newspaper publisher who wants to see change in the town.  Many well-known character actors (Kent Smith, Wallace Ford, Ann Shoemaker and particularly Ned Sparks) provide capable support.  A slight offering, perhaps, but quite worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "No one probably working today can imbue the image of a bride pissing in the middle of a golf course with the afterglow of existential soul-searching like Trier does here - well, there was Peter Greenaway at one point but I haven&apos;t kept track. Side by side the romantic, the visceral, the transcendent, each one perversely subverting the others. But, having searched and yearned, eventually with Trier we arrive at nothing. Nothing in the predominantly Western, post-enlightenment worldview that has pushed god to the side and seated the mind in his place. Nothing is too much for Trier then, because nothing satisfies the mind; everything that is touched by humanity is shown to be randomly bubbling up from some cold, infertile void.\n\nBut this is the thing with Trier, why it&apos;s so troubling to dismiss him; even though he makes art about a meaningless world - and so why pay attention? - he remains a powerful poet of cinema. So he is an anti-Tarkovsky, which perhaps explains why he opens the film with The Hunters in the Snow - a painting used in Solyaris - burning, and why horses are forced to kneel in the face of petulant violence. Whereas Tarkovsky understood the universe to be centered inside, and used that to sculpt space and metaphor from that center, Trier is grounded nowhere; so he resolves to orbit from one periphery to the next, nicely framing for us anxieties that we can relate to but with no deeper insight of their mechanism.\n\nBut now and then he works from a powerful set of ideas. Here it is the mirrored metaphor; the pain and suffering of life on earth as mirrored on the cosmic level, and our hope that this suffering looming above will just pass us by. It is not sci-fi in any way you may recognize, or anymore than Tree of Life is.\n\nIt does not work like that, of course, that is a given. So we are placed in the shoes of the woman - the bride in her wedding reception, where life is ritually supposed to become orderly, assuring, meaningful - and forced to make our way for the occasion wearing a forced smile, and hoping the pain will just pass us by. Yes, it does not work like that. The mother is haughty and domineering, the father sloppy and indiscreet. Everyone else is busy performing their roles, going through motions, speeches, confrontations which are often funny but always grueling to see. So,with the soul unsupervised, the perfect occasion for happiness inexplicably crumbles from inside.\n\nThe second part is about the sister, who already has the perfectly happy life or is supposed to. But again, of course, it doesn&apos;t work. Suffering, uncertainty hangs above that we can&apos;t simply brush off. So it is the dawning of acceptance that governs this part of the film; but, properly at least for Trier and in a way that should make sense, we&apos;re shown the impossibility of that acceptance. Faces are increasingly bewildered, affections grow distant, motions agitated.\n\nA lot of my distaste for what Trier does, is exemplified in a scene where the depressed sister confronts the other; instead of reciprocating the nurture and support, however obligatory it may have seemed at the time, she preys on her weakness. Why drink wine in the veranda and pretend none of this is going to happen? Why not? \n\nBut the acceptance is handled with so much nihilism, a sort of comfortable noncommittal, that I want to take a step back. No equanimity flows from Trier&apos;s emptiness, and so the vision is useless for me. I want films embedded in a world that matters in some way. Yes, we&apos;re all going to face an inscrutable fate, but it&apos;s one thing to frame this with compassion, another thing altogether to frame with contempt or cold satisfaction.\n\nSo it is apt to compare with Tree of Life on more than just the cosmic level of wheels whirring life into pattern; there is the sense of emptying out, the search for a true face that restores meaning. Malick goes the extra mile though, he reconciles into the impermanence of all things and from there a deep, loving humanity. Trier is simply left aghast at it. Sex is a vice and the mind is unable to cope; so he merely casts the characters away at the precipice. But not before ironically rendering human faith as a magical cave made from fire sticks.\n\nOh, he captures the drab, grueling unlife of depression well, no wonder as he knows from personal experience. And a google search seems to yield a nod at Filippino filmmaker Lav Diaz, that was pretty unexpected.\n\nThere are aesthetically-minded pleasures though that you should see; planets caressing each other like faces below, a bird&apos;s eye view of horses galloping. Some of it borders on kitsch when Kirsten Dunst is photographed naked beneath the moonglow, the schadenfreude is so earnestly conceived.\n\nAnd there is the parting image; I don&apos;t know how much of it was the theater, technology, but it swell up into the most deafening, soul-crushing crescendo. I could feel particles being dislocated inside of me. But considering what comes before, it&apos;s not something I wanted to swim into but let wash. It&apos;s fitting for Trier though, the wagnerian sound of the void washing life empty.\n\nIt is a powerful work, don&apos;t just take it lightly. But I urge you to meditate against it. \n\nOh yes, it is all going to end sooner or later. But, as a principle, I urge you to never settle for a destructive void in your life: in the midst of blistering destruction, try to see around you what the Eastern mystics knew as the universe of 10,000 beautiful things trampled by god Shiva in his final dance. Let yourself be filled with a profound sadness that is joy for the 10,000 beautiful things around you."

      "reviewBody": "Little flavor of 80s (long skirts and no obnoxious dresses), Good music, Naseeruddin Shah at his best as usual, and add a new face on top of that. That&apos;s Hero Hiralal for you. People said that it was an inconsequential movie. May be so. What could we expect at the time when Govinda, Anil Kapoor, and other actors were churning out non-sense in the late 80s. Hero Hiralal was a breath of freshness, which was obviously not meant for the masses, however, it may have seemed so. All shots that focused Naseer and Sanjana together were superb in terms of photography, facial focus and dialogues. True that Sanjana couldn&apos;t speak Hindi without an accent. What do you expect from an Anglo-Indian girl? But ironically, I still find hers better than the accent of some of today&apos;s actresses who speak Hindi like they were born and raised somewhere in Midwest USA.\n\nI found Sanjana quite charming (much more beautiful than her nieces Karishma and Kareena). Sapno Ki Duniya (slow version) was a terrific song, obviously lost due to movie&apos;s commercial failure. Saeed Jafri, Satish Shah and Mr. Yogi fame actor were good in supporting roles. Deepa Mehta was OK and others merely filled in. This is a movie with no frills, no beach dances, no non-sense. A simple and pure means of entertainment meant for the whole family. \n\nIt&apos;s unfortunate that Sanjana&apos;s career didn&apos;t click in Bollywood. May be it was her accent or may be it was her timing. Or may be she was just meant for Prithvi Theater. A great movie. Watch it at least once and then decide. By the way, finally the DVD is out for this movie. At least someone recognized the movie!",

      "reviewBody": "In the 30&apos;s, in Caleb County, the loathed hermit Felix Bush (Robert Duvall) offers a large amount of money to the local Rev. Gus Horton (Gerald McRaney) to organize his funeral, but the preacher refuses the request. The family man Buddy Robinson (Lucas Black) overhears the conversation and talks to his boss Frank Quinn (Bill Murray); they visit Felix and offer the service of the Quinn Funeral Home. Felix requests a funeral party and invites anyone that has a story to tell about him. Further, he offers his three hundred acre land for US$ 5.00 a ticket to be disputed in a raffle. When Felix asks Buddy to drive him to Illinois to see Rev. Charlie Jackson (Bill Cobbs), Buddy learns that Felix has a painful secret and need the help of his friend to disclose it to the population.\n\n&quot;Get Low&quot; has an interesting premise of a funeral for a man that is still alive in a good screenplay. The cast is excellent, with Robert Duvall, Lucas Black, Bill Murray, Bill Cobbs and Sissy Spacek. The reconstitution of the 30&apos;s is very careful in an excellent work of costumes and art direction. Unfortunately, the story is weak, and the revelation of Felix&apos;s secret that should be the climax of the film does not impact and neither justify the attitude of Felix Bush toward the locals nor his self-punishment. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Segredos de um Funeral&quot; (&quot;Secrets of a Funeral&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Lonely Hearts (2006)\n\nA steady, interesting, colorful crime movie packed with both great old tropes from the film noir days and lots of familiar tricks. Amazingly, it&apos;s based on a true story from post-war America that goes way way way beyond the slimmed up version here. \n\nThe result is good, yes, but never mesmerizing, never a complete surprise, and never up to the potential of the either the source material or the talented cast. The very dependence of well known formulas for a kind of classic look and feel is what holds it back, because we know those formulas so well. The one aspect to the movie that is forcibly modern is the one that feels so forced it&apos;s almost pandering to a contemporary audience--lots of open swearing and sexual references in a manner not really &quot;right&quot; for a 1951 America.\n\nSeveral lead actors are terrific. Salma Hayek, once she arrives, is an edgy bad girl, a woman with little moral code and a comfort level with blood and manipulation that makes an old school femme fatale look like schoolroom stuff. Her bad boy companion, Jared Leto, at first comes off as a Robert Downey Jr. wannabe, but he gradually hardens up his edges and by the end is pretty believable as a cocksure murderous idiot. The two cops, John Travolta and James Gandolfini, are a great pair, the one restrained and more in tune with the criminals, the other the sidekick with a good heart. (They might be modeled after, say, Glenn Ford and William Bendix, as two 1951 actors who could have pulled off the same roles with more conviction.)\n\nThe filming, the editing, the pace, the sets, the old cars, the interior and exterior location shoots, all of the nuts and bolts are in place here for a good movie. (Of these, the photography is the most routine, partly because of how it&apos;s directed, as in the last scene when the cops swarm the house--it could have been really exciting.) But overall it&apos;s the script--the script, not the story--that holds it all back. The parallel plots of the two criminals in their love affair crime spree and the cops on their trail is clear and fine, but unrevealing. The events happen, and we sort of know how it will end. And it does (not to give away anything!). If you want the true facts, go to the really long but readable account at trutv.com and type in the Lonely Hearts. \n\nAs a quick and hopefully helpful movie comparison, you can look at recent films like &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; or &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and see how a period piece film can brim with originality and better filming. A movie comes closer to this kind of familiar quality, based on older classic Hollywood models, is &quot;Public Enemies&quot; with Johnny Depp, though that one had some really beautiful moments in the photography. And what about that title? It is derived from the male killer&apos;s original tactic for getting money, which is given a comic treatment at the beginning of the movie--he writes to lonely women, gets them to fall in love with him, and steals their assets.\n\nA final revealing note: the director is the grandson of the cop who led the original investigation into the crimes. That means he&apos;s really well placed emotionally, but as a director he&apos;s really incomplete. It&apos;s amazing, in fact, that he got the budget and talent he did with such a short track record. Opportunity squandered? Partially. Give it a chance.",

The whole production looked luscious and Helmut Kaeutner&apos;s clever handling avoided any over-sentimental pitfall. He kept a tight control over the maudlin material, and sended the flamboyant doing in constant motion.\n\nMiss Leuwerik, who seemed to have fully understood the character of the lonely woman, wears gorgeous gowns, and brings some calm into the often lurid going-ons. The film&apos;s main weakness is a highly mannered, almost grotesquely attitudinizing O.W. Fischer, tearing his scenes to tatters.\n\nThe film recouped every Mark of its high cost, and then some."

Every scene seemed important and the entertainment did not die down once. This is a ghost story type of movie and honestly it kinda felt like a TV movie, but that just made for a warm feel. Fellas, it&apos;s a good movie to watch with your girlfriend, but don&apos;t expect blood and guts because its the uneasy type of scary that this films delivers. There should be more low key horror films like this. another title that&apos;s similar but a little upscale with the terror is &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh&quot;. I highly recommend it if you liked &quot;The Skeptic&quot;.",

Although most of the characters have only slight political preferences, they will be affected one way or another by the ups and downs of the conflict. Unlike some other films dealing with the Spanish Civil War, this movie is not about the opposing forces in conflict, but about the middle class citizens and their strategies for survival. Moral, sexual and family issues continue to occur during the war, but the approaches to deal with them have changed considerably. Great acting by Agustín Gonzalez as Don Luis. A very young Victoria Abril.",

      "reviewBody": "The film opens with Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) being interviewed for a home-care nursing position. Oddly, she&apos;s asked during the interview if she believes in witchcraft. She gets the position, working for Paul Holland (Tom Conway), who is a wealthy plantation owner on the Caribbean island of St. Sebastian. Holland has hired her to take care of his wife, Jessica (Christine Gordon), who is in a perpetual state that resembles somnambulance. As Betsy spends more time on the island, she learns that most of the population believes in and practices voodoo, and she learns that Jessica had a relatively tumultuous past with Holland&apos;s family.\n\nThis was director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton&apos;s second horror/thriller collaboration (the first being Cat People (1942) and the third The Leopard Man (1943)). For many viewers, it is their favorite of the three. While I like the film, I don&apos;t like it quite that much--I prefer Cat People. But still, I Walked With A Zombie ends up with a 7 out of 10 from me.\n\nThe horror aspects of I Walked With A Zombie are really very minor. They&apos;re really present only as a kind of personification of the results of complicated romantic and familial relationships. Yes, there is an admirable &quot;haunted house&quot;-styled scene involving a spooky stairway and creepy, distant sounds, and yes, the trek to the voodoo &quot;home fort&quot; is well done, but this kind of material doesn&apos;t work as well for me here as it did in Cat People, because here it&apos;s not really the focus of the story. It&apos;s ancillary material with the function of helping to solve a very different kind of mystery. Also, much of the voodoo material (such as the actual ceremony) tends to be overrated in my opinion, although the final sequence related to the voodoo theme is appropriately eerie.\n\nBut what works best for me in I Walked With A Zombie are the many dialogue-heavy scenes where the three main characters--Connell, Holland and Wesley Rand (James Ellison)--gradually learn more about one another, and where the &quot;mystery&quot; is gradually uncovered. A scene where a local &quot;minstrel&quot; sings part of the backstory while Connell and Rand are having a drink is exquisite, for example. Yet, even with this positive aspect, I never felt that the backstory was sufficiently explained. The mystery remains, and the moralizing bookends of the film do not help, either.\n\nStill, I Walked With A Zombie is definitely worth a watch, and based on the extravagant praise that many viewers utter towards the film, you might like it much better than I do.",

Think of this fabulous movie as of Lucy Jordan&apos;s life set in an alternate universe, a universe in which she doesn&apos;t kill herself at 37. Rather, she rides out her life as a radiant wife and a loving mother of two. Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn) is about ten years older than Lucy Jordan at her time of dying. But her father-figure husband (Alan Arkin), many years her senior, isn&apos;t getting any younger, her kids are distant both physically and emotionally, and her friends are really not much help at all. As Pippa starts to lose it, a stranger (Keanu Reeves) comes to town. Writer-director Rebecca Miller, who is also an actress of some distinction, has composed an engaging tale that is touching, but never cheesy. There&apos;s a moment in one of the flashbacks when the story is about to take a Charlie Kaufman turn, but it doesn&apos;t. No regrets though. Outstanding performances by Robin Wright Penn as Pippa Lee, Blake Lively as her younger self, and Maria Bello as her mother. Guest appearance by Winona Ryder as Pippa&apos;s best friend Sandra. Stay for Lucinda Williams, whose 1978 classic &quot;I lost it&quot; is playing over the credits.",

      "reviewBody": "I wonder how many Hong Kong movies there are about noble kung fu fighters being harassed by wicked Japanese martial arts experts trying to prove their superiority; I&apos;ve seen a few (the most famous being Bruce Lee&apos;s 1972 classic Fist of Fury), but given the racial tension that has long existed between the Japanese and the Chinese, and the prolific nature of the Hong Kong movie industry, I have the strange feeling that I&apos;ve only scratched the surface...\n\nShaolin Killers (AKA The Bloody Fight), which was made the same year as Fist of Fury, stars Tan Chin as Choi Sai Ho, a talented fighter who is rejected by Master Tien for killing a Japanese warrior while defending a young couple. Shortly after, a gang of Japanese fighters, led by Chen Chang (Fong Yao), rock up and challenge several local kung fu masters to a duel to the death—which results in several dead kung fu masters, including Master Tien (who forgives his exiled student just before dying).\n\nTien&apos;s pretty daughter Chi Ling (Ingrid Hu) flees to her uncle&apos;s school, but it&apos;s not long before Chen Chang turns up there as well. After Chen knocks seven shades of the proverbial out of Chi Ling&apos;s uncle, the young woman tracks down Choi Sai Ho and he is accepted into her uncle&apos;s school. There, Choi Sai Ho helps to develop a fighting technique designed to beat the Japanese, by combining three styles of martial arts and perfecting a method of always landing on one&apos;s feet when thrown (based on the aerodynamics of a shuttlecock!!!).\n\nIf you manage to lay your hands on this movie, I hope for your sake it&apos;s of a better quality than my DVD, which looks like it was taken from a fuzzy old VHS tape. Image quality issues aside, I quite enjoyed this old-school chop socky flick: it features a cool villain in the expressionless Chen Chang, lots of fight action with plenty of leaping through the air, a fun battle involving drunken style kung fu, a pair of kick-ass Chinese cuties, a smattering of bright red gore, the obligatory training montage, and a frantic smack-down at the end which culminates with the hilarious sight of Choi Sai Ho balancing on Chen Chang&apos;s shoulders while his partner Tien Hwon (Alan Tang) gives the Japanese bully-boy a jolly good kicking.",

And after watching it just yesterday, it would be fair to say that this picture by far is the best modern picture made by Indonesian filmmaker.\n\nIt is a bold, horrifying, intense and mean noir psychological horror. The horrid surreal atmosphere and chilling gore very much remind me of Lynch&apos;s and Aronofsky&apos;s style which is outstanding. Watching this movie really gives you a more complex horrid feeling than any kind of Indonesian horror with excessive portion of demon and ghost appearance more than you beg for of which you can&apos;t help but to smirk. And fairly said, this movie has put back faith in me that indeed Indonesian filmmaker can so do much better than only of those sex exploit movies and series of ridicule horror.\n\nFinally said, this movie is very recommended as an introductory to a fine piece of Indonesian modern cinema. And despite the plot may not be very original at all and at some point the gory scene may need a little extra stomach to bear, but to skip this modern horror experience would be a sin to every horror/thriller movie lover.",

      "reviewBody": "A flick I ran across on home video in the mid-1990s in a vhs bargain bin. Originally filmed in 1990 with the intent on it being a theatrical release, then subsequently shelved by the movie studio for a few years and eventually getting a brief release on the cable movie channel Showtime and turning up as a home video rental.\n\nI suppose I can see as to why Fatal Charm never made it to the movie theaters, since it in essence smacks of being something made-for-tv. Far as star power goes. Christopher Atkins circa 1990 wasn&apos;t going to be much of a draw at the box office, nor was Can&apos;t Buy Me Love co-star Amanda Peterson.\n\nUltimately, though, it&apos;s the sort of scattershot, all-over-the-place nature of the plot combined with a lot of situational silliness that kinda sinks Fatal Charm. The plot concerns itself with a cute but depraved young man accused of raping and murdering several women (the film is pretty explicit in professing his guilt, so there&apos;s really no &apos;whodunnit&apos; or &apos;did he do it?&apos; angle) and a high school teen girl who inexplicably becomes obsessed with him. There&apos;s the subplot of the high school girl being uncomfortable with her mother&apos;s boyfriend who is trying to molest her, along with the subplot of the said girl ditching school to see the trial of her obsession, along with the subplot of his conviction/incarceration/escape from prison. The various situations seemed fairly plausible as the movie began but the flick got more and more silly as the story unfolded and the conclusion is an eye-roller.",

      "reviewBody": "Still among the most worthwhile of the familiar holiday movies, this classic version of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; has a combination of cast, story, and production that works well. Maureen O&apos;Hara, young Natalie Wood, and Edmund Gwenn would probably have carried it pretty well by themselves, and they are joined by a very good supporting cast. The screenplay is nicely done, bringing out the fantasy elements of the story without letting it become trite.\n\nGwenn, who played many solid character roles, gets the chance here to play a role for which he was ideally suited, and it works very well. O&apos;Hara and Wood make a good pair to balance him out. The supporting cast gets some very good moments of their own, especially Gene Lockhart and William Frawley, whose scenes are entertaining while also offering some occasionally pointed commentary.\n\nThe style of the production is well-suited to the material, offering an innocently upbeat story without overdoing it on sentimentality. For all that this style of the production and acting are out of fashion, they are able to capture a theme like this in a worthwhile way that is simply not possible with the kind of false &quot;sophistication&quot; that permeates so many present-day movies.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say that this is some kind of masterpiece, which it is not and did not try to be. Instead, it&apos;s a light, enjoyable, positive movie that does make a worthwhile point or two. That kind of feature will always find an appreciative audience somewhere."

      "reviewBody": "Dhool Ka Phool (1959) : Brief Review -\n\nStaggering debut for Yash Chopra in a socially and morally powerful and challenging movie. We all know Yash Chopra as a legendary Bollywood director but we hardly talk about his early movies, which I believe are much better than his post-80s flicks that are definitely overrated comparatively. Dhool Ka Phool is a dream debut for any director and I don&apos;t wonder why it was Yash Chopra who made his debut with such a socially challenging film. DKP is about sexual mistake, moral dishonesty, communal hatred, identity crisis, forgiveness and above all &quot;humanity.&quot; It&apos;s difficult to believe that one single movie tackled with so many challenges subjects and came through as a winner, cinematically, morally, intellectually and dramatically. &quot;Bachche nazayaz nahi hote judge sahab, maa baap hote hai.&quot; What a dialogue! Isn&apos;t it preserved in Bollywood&apos;s library yet? &quot;Tu na Hindi banega na Musalman banega, insaan ki aulad hai insaan banega&quot; has to be one of the most, no sorry, the most socially damaging and communally powerful song ever made in Bollywood, or for that matter, in Indian cinema. What a great album otherwise. There are several dialogues in the movie that hate you hard and I&apos;d like to keep them in my library of best lines from Bollywood history. The protagonist, supposed to be an educated and sensible man, loses his nerve after a pre-marriage sex and loses his morality after marrying some other girl. The same man talks about &quot;dignity&quot;! Holy smoke! That has to be the best antagonising transformation of the lead actor ever! As per God&apos;s plans (as we assume, I mean), he loses his own child. In an earlier scene, he was bashing the boy as &quot;Dharti ka Boj,&quot; not knowing that he was the one who brought that boj to Dharti. Mukhram Sharma, you beauty! That emotional send-off to the most noble character in the film, Abdul Chacha, was painful and intellectual. It has to be a Muslim character in a film led by Hindu characters. Who thinks out of the box like that? Yash Chopra, you genius! Hands down.\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps its the beautiful rolling sound of the Italian dialogue telling the story of Julius Cesar that made this enjoyable at least to the auditory sense. Perhaps it was that the language was sometimes amended to be more modern and meaningful. Perhaps it was the explained parallels of some of the prisoners experiences that helped to make the context more understandable. No matter, it was a thoroughly great way to start the Sydney Film Festival. The fact that this was a script within a script set in a prison using some real life prisoners didn&apos;t detract from anything in this film for me - I go to the cinema generally looking for a story, a fabrication, an unreality dressed in reality. I liked the gritty black and white, the sub-line of the prison life and setting. Yes, perhaps a prisoner saying he now felt caged etc didn&apos;t have to be said because it was obvious, but all in all a very enjoyable watch. I was engaged and participating from beginning to end. For me, one of the better versions of Julius/Shakespeare and a nice twist on an old but everlasting story.",

      "reviewBody": "Long before Miami Vice which had hip cop Don Johnson living on a boat with an alligator in Miami Beach, you had Frank Sinatra as private eye Tony Rome doing the same.\n\nHe&apos;s an ex-cop now a private eye who still has an inside with the police in the person of Richard Conte who&apos;s his former partner. Turns out he needs him when he takes the case of Sue Lyon who misplaced a diamond stickpin. \n\nBefore the film ends Sinatra has himself all involved with every member of Lyon&apos;s family including wives and ex-wives, husbands and ex-husbands in a lovely blackmail scheme. Quite a number of people wind up dead including Sinatra&apos;s private eye partner Robert J. Wilkie. In the tradition of Sam Spade, though he might not have thought Wilkie the salt of the earth, it&apos;s an obligation to find out who shortened Wilkie&apos;s life span.\n\nTony Rome is a Sinatra project through and through. Basically he just plays himself or at least shows the public persona that we know him for. Frank got parts in this for restaurant owner pallies, Mike Romanoff and Jilly Rizzo and one even for Rocky Graziano as a punch drunk old pug. There&apos;s even a part for Jill St. John as an amorous divorcée who you&apos;re never quite sure how she fits in the story. Jill and Frank were once a hot item, but this one was for old time sake.\n\nThe problem with Tony Rome is you really do have to be a Sinatra fan to watch it. And I don&apos;t mean just of his singing, you have to be really into the whole rat pack scene. \n\nOtherwise Tony Rome and it&apos;s sequel Lady in Cement just ain&apos;t for you.",

It&apos;s really deep, it make me think. \n\nTo me, this is a story about sense of insecurity and loneliness. A 20+ girl, 30+ girl, 40+ girl, the Shi Go, Jerry... \n\nThey are all experiencing loneliness and emptiness, they are lost, they need something in life, they try to seek for something that can fill up the emptiness, but it&apos;s not work. \n\nSylvia Chang did a good job, she make you feel how the character feel, how lost they are, how much they need someone to solve their sense of insecurity. \n\nThis is a very worth watching movie~ I hope the Hong Kong or Taiwan movie industry able make more this kind of film, which is sincere and deep, and character driven. \n\nI want to thanks Sylvia Chang for her masterpiece~",

First times I watched the movie ( I already have seen it a dozen times) I just laughed about it. But after some times watching I saw what the director wanted to say with it.\n\nIn my own life the same thing happened but not as heavy as in the movie. I mean, in my life the day just become another day. ( really I ask myself, the only thing that was different that was the date) I think a lot of people live in groundhog day, doing the same thing again and again, not taking the best out of life. Just living without any consciousness. Not having enough time by their own fault, because time is a thing you can offer yourself by making other choices.\n\nGroundhog day....I personally am getting rid of that day more and more fortunately and finally too. More and more I am trying to make best of life and using every day in another way. \n\nI am not crazy. No, I just watch movies with some kind of view lately. In every movie there is a hidden message told.\n\nEnough about Ground Hog day....I gave the movie an 8 because the number 8 is the number of eternity. And that&apos;s also a thing the movie is about. About eternity and not about the bad and boring repeating of the stupid livings.\n\nDanny",

With the Russians and America in a race to see who can get there first and be highest, quickest and longest in space, a group of pilots are selected to become the first men in space for America.\n\nI have had this film for many years and have only seen it twice now  I always get put off by having to find three + hours free to watch it! However I am a fool as whenever I do watch it the time flies by easily. Such is the appeal of the film that everything works and only the odd scene at the end drags a little.  The story skips through the space programme focusing as much on the flights as it does on the men and their families. It also manages to be very light hearted and good humoured, which succeeds in making it easy and fun to watch.  The history being told may not be well known by all (I&apos;m too young to remember and am also in the UK), but it is well told and becomes more a story of the men whose courage made it happen rather than a history lesson.\n\nGiven that so much hinges on the men being interesting and likeable characters it was important to have a good cast, and the ensemble assembled here really put in good work to bring the names to life (although how close to their real personalities they are I cannot say).  Taking one as an example, Fred Ward manages to be funny but also has to convey the more difficult side as he is forced to live with blame for the outcome of his mission.  Shepard represents the `unsung&apos; pilots left behind in the sky who put the space programme in motion in the first place, and he does it well with a real sense that he has a lot of men behind him.  Glenn, Harris, Quaid Henriksen, Frank and Paulin all do sterling work to varying degrees. However even minor roles are played by faces who do well  Hershey is good and carries the role of `the women behind the men&apos; really well.  Moffat is funny as Lyndon Johnson and Goldblum and Shearer are hilarious with their running jokes.\n\nThe film is very flag waving  but the good humour stopped that aspect of it sticking in my throat. It is a very enjoyable and accomplished film.  Not only does it manage to inform and entertain but it also paints a very good picture of the men who started and ran the space programme and the effect the risks had on them and their families.  All this and it still makes me laugh out loud!  Three hours simply flies by."

      "name": "it&apos;s kind of like a drug movie- actually, it really is, and an absorbing one",
      "reviewBody": "After a while, I really did get more of what director Paul Schrader was aiming for with Auto Focus, the tale of males caught in some sort of odd damnation of both free will and morality. It&apos;s more like a drug movie, only here the drug being the opposite sex, and almost a singularly male ego-trip, instead of common narcotics. But it&apos;s also a very fine character study where the idea of character is taken into consideration, of how much one can seem a certain way, but then be stuck in with flaws and insecurities and, ultimately, temptation. The last of which is what Schrader puts into focus early on, but then after a while when temptation is gone, the film becomes a direct plunge into complete debauchery. And appropriately, like with all addicts, for a while nothing seems wrong at all about all of this.\n\nGreg Kinnear is definitely in one of his best parts here, as he plays someone who is an actor who keeps his actor-like charms off the set as well. In Hollywood, away from the confines of Connecticut, his Bob Crane lands the lead on Hogan&apos;s heroes, but can&apos;t resist the first temptations of the night-life. This comes, in an introductory way and then throughout as a tag-along/counterpart, with John Carpenter (not the director, played with the best match by Willem Dafoe of being a creep and alluring at times), who shows him the ropes and hooks him up with video equipment. But as Crane goes deeper into his sexual drives, divorces, marries again and divorces again, his acting career and his livelihood seem to slip away. The themes of being perversely the &apos;All-American Male&apos; are accentuated by Kinnear&apos;s Crane in voice-over as he talks about the unbridled joys of sex, and in an interview with a Christian publication he says &apos;I don&apos;t...make waves&apos;. By the last third of his story, however, into the rot of the 70s, he&apos;s lost touch with the reality of his pleasures- or rather necessities.\n\nAuto Focus isn&apos;t at times an easy movie to sit through; it&apos;s even cringe-worthy in a couple of scenes (notably for me was when he guest stars on a celebrity cooking show, only to keep on his sexually-driven side with audience members). Then there are other scenes (i.e. &apos;you have fingers up you-know-where&apos;, and the genital enhancement) where male masculinity is questioned, and in very peculiar ways between Crane and Carpenter; Crane is homophobic, but then what exactly is Carpenter&apos;s function? More than anything, less than being a friend, he becomes a kind of unintentional pusher, where the draw of going out on the town becomes a crux for both of the men. What&apos;s just as fascinating then is how Schrader aligns this with his style- the first half is mostly very slick and professional-looking, almost like an HBO bio-pic or something. But then as the characters lose a grip on everything except themselves, there&apos;s a hand-held, distorted view to everything. There&apos;s lots of nudity and on-screen sex (some blurred out, likely by MPAA request), yet Schrader gets something more shocking, in the mind at least, as Carpenter almost becomes the antagonist in a way as the story winds down (the last phone call marks this most).\n\nAuto Focus has the ideal of the usual biographical drama of a somebody in Hollywood who soon loses himself to becoming a nobody, but there&apos;s plenty under the surface that makes it more intriguing. Crane&apos;s two sides to his persona- the celebrity one, and the personal &apos;lifestyle&apos; one- become one and the same after a while, Kinnear being able to make such a near-irredeemable person somewhat sympathetic (or at the least very watchable). And Carpenter&apos;s more truthful, emotional, and scary turn is made palatable by Dafoe&apos;s equally nuanced performance. It&apos;s not great, but it&apos;s a near-classic of the tale-of-such-and-such-star when so many don&apos;t take in what&apos;s deeper into account. A-",

A few of the subplots were educational as well as exploring the values of friendship,loyalty and the like which is probably standard fare for these types of films. As a 47 year old bloke I enjoyed it and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone but especially for the target audience of young families you can&apos;t go wrong.",

      "reviewBody": "When watching a Comedy/Romance movie, most of the times, you expect it to be witty, sometimes funny about a love story between two hot protagonists. Or when it is Drama/Romance typed, you expect some complications, involving family problems, or the likes.. . But this one is neither of these, it&apos;s more like an everyday realistic &quot;romance&quot; that most people must already know.\n\nI prefer not saying much more about the film, because i perfectly enjoyed it without having any idea about it, so you better not read any reviews containing spoilers or the likes, if you want to enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nThe acting was perfect, a little different Aoi Yu and a completely different Juri Ueno. I don&apos;t know much about the director&apos;s style or other films, but one day i may become his/her fan.\n\na nearly 2 hours film, with a beautiful slow pace that let you be more and more closer to the characters, and feeling like you&apos;re one of them. Highly recommended , preferably in a rainy or a snowy day.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Lukas Moodysson has achieved a film that is so moving that it is hard to forget it after leaving the theater. Images come back into one&apos;s mind about this story about this girl. The tragedy of her life is something to be shocked and alarmed.\n\nTo think there are out there, in the so-called civilized world, people that take advantage of girls like Lilja is mind boggling. Lilja&apos;s mother has to be one of the worst monsters ever presented in a film. This woman abandons her 16 year old daughter because she has found a meal ticket with a man that will probably end up leaving her as well.\n\nLilja is beautifully portrayed by Oksana Akinshina. The actress and her character disappear in front of your eyes. The story is very true as thousands of naive girls are exported from what it was the old Soviet Union to other countries in order to force them into prostitution. This story is constantly in the news, yet more and more young girls are duped into going abroad with the promise of highly paid jobs that exist only for the people who exploit them.\n\nHer only friend is Volodya, also a very sad boy who is thrown out of his own house by an abusive father. Volodya and Lilja form a bond as they cling to one another. The little boy is street wise; he knows the fate that awaits Lilja in Sweden. Their friendship is the only thing they both have.\n\nThe sad part of the film is the realization that so called &quot;normal&quot; and perfectly &quot;respectful&quot; people are the same ones that brutalize these children. They use Lilja to satisfy their sexual appetites, then discard her like yesterday&apos;s trash. To know that there are people like that in our society is a very sad commentary about our world.\n\nContrary to what many people have commented about the film, I thought that in spite of the tragedy of Lilja&apos;s and Volodya&apos;s lives, it had a very positive ending because both are free to run around in a better place together, which is not a luxury most of us have on our time in this planet.\n\nMr. Moodysson gives us a film that will shock; he dares to go where others wouldn&apos;t. A job well done..",

      "name": "The quest for truth",
      "reviewBody": "The movie begins with a short lecture by Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz (1886 - 1980), a Polish philosopher and ethicist, where illumination is described as a mystical experience, a revelation of truth beyond the senses, the definition attributed to St. Augustine. The explanation is refreshing since many journalists and hack writers today believe that mysticism is &quot;seeing things that are not there&quot; and bears no relation to truth.\n\nFranciszek, the protagonist, is engaged in an unending quest for illumination, although not entirely in Tatarkiewicz&apos;s sense. The first stage is his study of physics, where he believes he will &quot;learn things which can be known unequivocally&quot; (this was before string theory, 10-dimensional space and multiverses). However, he feels he is learning the physics of the past; the labs where he works seem to confirm this. Other stages of his quest follow. Some involve science and/or religion and are sought by Franciszek, others are forced upon him by real life. In the end, a sort of illumination is reached, although it bears little relation to the object of Franciszek&apos;s quest.\n\nThis movie was made in 1973 when Jean-Luc Godard cast a long shadow on world cinema. His influence is felt (fast cutting, sometimes almost subliminal; photographs, titles, diagrams, apparently unscripted conversations) although it is filtered through the world view of the director. The result, as in the best Godard&apos;s movies, is a sort of alienation effect that suits the tale.\n\nStanislaw Latallo plays Franciszek&apos;s to perfection, his physique matching exactly the character. The rest of the cast is also excellent\n\nFilm Studio Tor is a film production company established in 1967 in Warsaw, since 1980 under the direction of Zanussi. The studio has posted some of its productions (like this movie) on You Tube.",

      "reviewBody": "While promoting &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; back in the 1990&apos;s Tarantino while explaining his casting of John Travolta in what would be one of his most iconic roles, resurrecting his career and taking to a new status, the writer and director didn&apos;t mention &quot;Grease&quot; or &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; as why he thought Travolta was a good actor. He quoted loving him in movies such as &quot;Blow Out&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot; and this little gem called &quot;Perfect&quot;. Such opinions are quite surprising since most of those films (except &quot;Carrie&quot;) weren&apos;t box-office hits neither well criticized, some gaining cult status in the following years of its release. However, even with Quentin&apos;s approval &quot;Perfect&quot; still finds a great deal of unexplainable resistance among film buffs, currently giving to this one of the most absurd low ratings ever given to a quite decent movie. \n\nA short way to explain the story is thinking of an &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; made for the masses: it deals with ethics in journalism with Travolta playing a biased Rolling Stone reporter while unsatisfied with the running of a controversial article involving political officials dealing with corruption charges, decides to write a new and apparently harmless article on health clubs and their new function as being a cool dating place replacing the decadent singles bars. Yeah, why bothering going in places where everybody is so down when you go to a happier place, make lots of exercise and meet guys and girls with perfect bodies? There&apos;s something worth writing he thinks. Working as an obstacle to this story is a gym instructor (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) who doesn&apos;t trust reporters after a career damaging event when a reporter distorted facts while publishing a story involving her. While Travolta&apos;s story goes under false pretensions (with a bit of truth in it as well), he can&apos;t escape resisting some affection he has by the main character of his article, who each day goes by starts to like this guy, believing he&apos;s about to write a good report on the gym and its attendees. \n\nThe stone in the way of this movie is that its lack of seriousness while the events are being unfolded, often deeply concerned about the romance between the main characters. At times you think something really dangerous is about to happen, he&apos;s being followed by someone due to the other inflammable article where Travolta is torn in between telling about what his source said to him on an exclusive interview or go to jail to protect his source, but no, the film doesn&apos;t take off much from this scenario except towards its conclusion to be used as a closure to the gym instructor situation, a predictable and not very believable device. \n\nBut &quot;Perfect&quot; manages to keep you hold to your seat due to the reliable and impressive performances of Curtis, Travolta, Laraine Newman, Marilu Henner and small appearances from Kenneth Welsh and David Paymer. It drags down a bit when it stays for too long in the work out exercises, fun for the actors jumping up and down to the coolest and energic 1980&apos;s soundtrack but tiring for us viewers seeing an unimaginative lack of camera angles and poor editing which shifts from two different angles instead of being more acrobatic.\n\nStory delivered some valid points (although it can look ridiculously dated now since gym&apos;s are also definitely places for dating and no one questions those things anymore), might not be perfect (no pun intended), it was well balanced and easy to follow and feel interested. So, why viewers think this is one of the worst movies ever? Makes me wonder what some of you are watching these days. There&apos;s plenty of quality in &quot;Perfect&quot;, you just need to open your eyes to see it. 9/10",

Everyone else in my family left the USSR(Ukraine) in the 1970&apos;s.\n\nOne of the many reasons they left is because of the daily life problems that this movie depicts. People were afraid to say anything, or express their thoughts even remotely on how they felt about life in thing wrong with it. If they did so they would be either murdered thrown in jail or taken away never to be heard from again. East West is a well made and easy to understand film that can be enjoyed by a lot of mainstream audiences."

      "name": "Bogart gives  a top-drawer performance as  flyboy/priest who takes refuge in a Chinese missionary hospital",
      "reviewBody": "Nice and intelligent film , being Humphrey&apos;s second to last movie providing an awesome acting . As he plays a pilot called James &apos;Jim&apos; Carmody (Bogart , though Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck were considered to star in this picture) attempting to escape in post WWIII , 1947 , dressed as a priest from the revenge of a Chinese warlord (Lee J Cobb) . At a Catholic mission in China , being long-awaited &quot;Father O&apos;Shea&quot; but there shows up Carmody posing as a cleric and he proves to be a two-fisted guy . At this place lives the enticing nurse Anne (Gene Tierney) , a gorgeous war widow , who believes she is falling in love with someone she can&apos;t marry . Meanwhile , China disintegrates in civil war (1945-1949) , warlords , revolution and fights between Maoists and nationalists. \n\nThis is a sensitive film including emotions , interesting dialogue , a marvelous love story and fine performances . The hand of Edward Dmytryk tends to rely heavily on the enjoyable relationship between Bogart and Tierney . The film is pretty well , though results are rather dull and sincere with an abundance of narrative dialog . Interesting screenplay by Alfred Hayes based on the novel &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; by William E. Barrett . Long time ago , William Faulkner completed an adaptation of the 1950 novel for director Howard Hawks , a longtime collaborator . Here Bogart in a new type of action role who proves to be surprisingly effective with the unusual character of an adventurer/pilot who disguised himself as a Catholic cleric . Gene Tierney is as beautiful as ever as the attractive woman . However , being last starring screen appearance of actress Gene Tierney, who had been suffering from mental illness for a number of years and entered various treatment centers . Support cast is frankly well , such as : Agnes Moorehead , E.G. Marshall , Jean Porter , Carl Benton Reid and Lee J Cobb is great as a warlord . The movie displays a luxurious and colorful cinematography by Franz Planer . Emotive and moving musical score by the classical composer Victor Young , including a stirring leitmotif . \n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Edward Dmytryk , though being slow-moving and with penchant to weight rather heavily on the proceedings . A veteran filmmaker, Dmytryck is one of Hollywood&apos;s most prolific directors who started his career in the early 40s . He was a craftsman whose career was interrupted by the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), a congressional committee that employed ruthless tactics aimed at rooting out and destroying what it saw as Communist influence in Hollywood . A lifelong political leftist who had been a Communist Party member briefly during World War II, Dmytryk was one of the so-called &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; who refused to cooperate with HUAC and had their careers disrupted or ruined as a result . The committee threw him in prison for refusing to cooperate, and after having spent several months behind bars , Dmytryk decided to cooperate . Dmytrick&apos;s biggest film was ¨The Caine Mutiny¨ , but he also realized another mutiny film titled : ¨Mutiny¨ with Angela Lansbury . Edward was an expert on warlike genre as ¨Back to Batan¨ , ¨Battle of Anzio¨ , ¨Young lions¨ and Western as ¨Broken lance¨ , ¨Alvarez Kelly¨ , ¨Warlock¨ , among others . Rating : 6.5/10 , better than average . It&apos;s recommended for drama enthusiasts and big stars lovers .",

Possibly because, apart for the famous In the realm of the senses, very few have watched his films. Ceremony, in my opinion, is his best film. It is extraordinary how he constructs the narration of this family saga, and how he makes it resonate with thoughts and feelings in every minute of it, putting in shame all of the more applauded asian family stories that became famous movies over the kast decades. But he also surpasses many acclaimed European directors of his time. Ceremony is an undisputed masterpiece that you watch shivering , a proof that cinema can be made out of pure magic!",

The first parts of the city reconstructed are for the few wealthy while the majority of the people make do in their squatter huts.  The hardships and anxieties of the social and economic devastation are played out by a few people trying to better themselves and those just trying to get by. Hopelessness and chronic unemployment lead to alternative attempts at income and normalcy which trigger a downward spiral.\n\nReview: It was banned in Korea because it was so realistically stark in it&apos;s post war depiction.  It was similar to and inspired by Italy&apos;s &quot;The Bicycle Thief,&quot; but not as good.  The film was pretty dark so the titles showed up even better.  You could see that the locations were real because of the adaptations people had made in their shanties were so numerous &amp; functional. The disparity between the barely haves &amp; have nots was a source of conflict shown by the rubble which also representative of the human spirit.  The cinematographic efforts were clearly present, but it was obvious there wasn&apos;t much experience with the tools of the trade on hand.  The individual character development was complete in that the many problems exemplified by the individuals seemed to be a basic part of their make up, and it was the subtext to their every action.  The pacing felt a bit slow at times, and the direction seemed to be trying to copy the film&apos;s predecessor rather than break wholly new ground.  This film was certainly ground breaking in Korea; that is of course why it was banned.  The many actors became their characters and successfully showed their struggles as individuals with their own ways of coping.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not on video, and is a very rare find in the States even though it is such an important work.",

      "reviewBody": "Bill Compton is a wealthy, conservative advertising executive who would be living the traditional American dream were it not for one thing: his daughter is a hippie. She and her boyfriend spend their days doing drugs and wasting time. After she overdoses, Compton accidentally kills the boyfriend in a fit of rage. Later he meets Joe, an ultra-right-wing blue-collar worker, and drunkenly tells the man his murderous secret. Joe believes he&apos;s found a kindred spirit in Compton and the two form an unlikely friendship. However, Joe&apos;s virulent hatred for anything and anyone liberal makes both men&apos;s lives increasingly complicated, violent and dangerous.\n\nDirected by John G. Avildsen, &apos;Joe&apos; is a character study and a drama about evolving cultural mores, highlighting the ideological schism that emerged between generations following the counter-culture revolution of the 60&apos;s. Norman Wexler&apos;s screenplay is sharp and full of fantastic, grittily realistic dialogue. It is unhampered by bias, scathing of both old school conservatism and the &apos;free love&apos; attitude of the hippie movement alike- not to mention political extremism and classism. While the story contains moments of violence and can be a tad melodramatic from time to time, at its&apos; heart it&apos;s a clever, subtle examination of two multi-faceted, realistic characters.\n\nCompton and Joe are disillusioned by a society in which they no longer feel comfortable. As many were at the time, they are threatened by the hedonistic lifestyle the youth of the film embody. However, they are also strangely attracted to it. Compton and Joe want to partake in the &apos;free love&apos; but can&apos;t allow themselves to because of their deeply held conservative beliefs. Thus, they are left out in the cold so to speak, and their violent reaction to their uncertain place in the &apos;modern&apos; world seems like a foregone conclusion from the beginning of the film because of the strength of Wexler&apos;s characterization.\n\nHaving said that, the supporting characters are all a little hollow and underwritten in comparison to Compton and Joe, most notably Compton&apos;s daughter, played by Susan Sarandon in her big screen debut. She comes across like a parody of a hippie, the kind you&apos;d see dancing in the background of a Peter Sellers&apos; farce from the 60&apos;s- or perhaps even one of the &apos;Austin Powers&apos; films. What makes it all the worse is the fact that Sarandon is completely stilted, wooden and lacking in charisma. Though in a few years she&apos;d start giving the powerful, nuanced performances she&apos;s known for today, it&apos;s a wonder her awfully mediocre work in &apos;Joe&apos; didn&apos;t derail her career just as it was beginning.\n\nOn the positive side of things, &apos;Joe&apos; features an atmospheric original soundtrack from Bobby Scott that makes good use of songs from the likes of Exuma and Dean Michaels. Michaels &apos;Hey Joe&apos; is particularly memorable, with lyrics reflecting the narrative beats of the film, as well as the ideology of the titular character. Besides directing, Avildsen also acted as cinematographer and his work has a naturalistic quality that is most affecting. The film is also very well-edited, having a brisk pace that makes Compton and Joe&apos;s journey to the dark side all the more exhilarating and frantic.\n\nDennis Patrick stars as Compton, delivering a performance of style and subtlety. Not as colorful or as openly bigoted as the titular character, Compton is nevertheless a complicated person with darkness in his soul, a man capable of extreme violence. Patrick couldn&apos;t have been better in the role, bringing to it much depth and intelligence. He makes Compton sympathetic- which is no mean feat considering the actions the character takes in the film- and he and co-star Peter Boyle work together marvelously.\n\nAlways a reliable actor, Boyle is brilliant as the bigoted blue-collar worker Joe. While not a likable character by any means, Boyle imbues Joe with a certain seedy charm and complexity that is intensely interesting and effective. He plays Joe as a regular man whose perception of reality is skewed by his political inclination, as one who can&apos;t see the truth from behind a blinding veil of conservative dogmatism. Boyle&apos;s assured performance is a joy to behold, and one can tell that he understood the character&apos;s motivations perfectly.\n\nIn short, John G. Avildsen&apos;s &apos;Joe&apos; is a powerful and clever parable about bigotry, principles and violence boasting a fine Norman Wexler screenplay and a great soundtrack from Bobby Scott. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle deliver two fascinating, impactful performances of great depth and complexity that are highlights in both men&apos;s filmographies. Although the supporting characters are a little underwritten- and some questionably acted- &apos;Joe&apos; is a terrific movie that has only gotten more relevant and entertaining with time.",

Yes, some of the plot is a bit on the silly side. However, I think that on the balance, the movie works for what it is intended to be.\n\nI think that the film work with the wolverines is great and deserves respect. Outside of it being a feel-good family movie, &quot;Running Free&quot; is also a small work of education on, or at least a cursory introduction to, these often under-understood creatures. This film shows that there is obviously more to the fearsome &quot;Devil Bear&quot; than its general reputation would suggest. Writer/Director Steve Kroschel is known for his personal love and dedication to wolverines. I suspect that a movie of this sort would only be possible through the caring work and knowledge of such a person.",

Literally, they spend most of the movie doing those three things, over and over and over, until you wonder why they don&apos;t all kill one another and drink one another&apos;s blood--not to survive, but just to shut everyone up. For a post- apocalyptic sci-fi type film, it&apos;s amazing how very little else happens in its very s- l-o-w two hours. And yet for all its ponderous and portentous stylings, it says nothing to us about survival or friendship or civilization or etc.--all the Big Issues this type of movie is supposed to have us ponder--that we don&apos;t get from airheaded Hollywood blockbusters like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot;",

It is really hard to point out a film which is better told, better crafted, having a more deeply love-story and such a overall fascinating aura. I do understand that everything is a question of taste but this masterpiece is so full of beauty and drama that you simply can not rate it under 8. If you do not like it so much = 8 , if you like it = 9 and if you love it&apos;s pure beauty = 10 And now go and watch this movie. You wont regret it if you like romance and love story&apos;s and beautifully crafted films.",

Such is the dire state of the Italian job market, since human memory (at least mine).\n\nMarta is a positive girl, despite her mother being sick with cancer and her boyfriend leaving her for a job in the US. Maybe slightly too positive, as she seems totally unaffected by being alone, jobless and her mother dying, but super happy to get a sort of live-in, babysitting arrangement in a dump with Sonia, a scatter-brained, single mother. Then Marta gets a job in a call centre and she&apos;s very good at it, but starts to be disturbed by the blatant dishonesty of the firm employing her.\n\nA darker side plot involves two high ranking employees Daniela and Claudio, who bought into the corrupt system, therefore tainted beyond salvation, while Marta can still redeem herself - or sort of.\n\nThe theme is treated mainly with a light, comedic touch that is morally ambiguous. The darker side of the plot does not work exactly because the moral corruption seems to be condemned in some cases and minimised in others.\n\nThe older characters Daniela and Claudio are beyond salvation because they&apos;re older, while Marta is an ordinary, modern good girl who loves children and has little problem with her &quot;friend&quot; Sonia servicing customers at home while her daughter waits in the street for mummy to &quot;finish doing her job&quot;. No moral issue, because they&apos;re young, I guess.\n\nUnder those circumstance having one&apos;s life still to be lived sounds more like a menace, but that could be the hidden sarcasm of the title.",

From the exquisite acting skills, tight editing, melancholic atmosphere, it is the embodiment of what an excellent film is all about. It truly illustrates the expression, &quot;less is more.&quot; No, it was not abounding in action, thrills, car races,and the like but requires the viewer to actually engage his intellect as he observes the gradual self-destruction of the so called leader of the pack. The film carries you along effortlessly as it envelopes you with deep resentments,guilt, jealousies,and low self-esteem issues. All this angst is interwoven with a realism rarely experienced in other films. I give it a resounding 10/10!!"

The male leading part, Lasse, is a pompous egocentric liar, and probably since the director is a woman, there are no forgiving points to his touchy performance. Maybe the director has to come to terms with some personal discomfort showing us this uncompromising unsympathetic character. Lasse shows a highly questionable jealousness to his partner&apos;s creative success, and it only gets worse as the plot progresses. Furthermore the director manages to make her female character thoroughly convincing, no question helped along by the fact that she herself is a woman. The ensemble of strange original characters in the surroundings add an almost Fellini like dimension to the sordid affair. Women can indeed be funny, in case you had any doubt.",

      "reviewBody": "If you loved Sir Alfred Hitchcock and his contributions and services to the film industry, you should see all of his films for study and preservation. This is one of his early silent films. If you have the patience to watch a two hour silent film, it&apos;s not that easy. We&apos;re so used to speeches and conversations that we forget to watch and see their facial reactions in the early age of cinema. This film is more comedic than dark and dramatic. While the story is more farcical, it is nice to see Hitchcock have a sense of humor since he became more known for the macabre in his films. It is not hard to believe that film audiences didn&apos;t laugh and enjoy this film in the cinema in 1928 long before the Great Depression. Still, I would watch it again if I had too. It&apos;s not a bad film. You wouldn&apos;t know Hitchcock directed it.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the younger reviewers commented:\n\n&quot;I couldn&apos;t help but compare the era and social climate around this movie to what we are experiencing today. I am disturbed and disappointed. Why is it that it seemed as if there were loads more people being active in what they believed back in those days. I understand that it was a different time, and many in the world were just learning to use their voices... Perhaps we feel that we just don&apos;t know enough about a subject to get behind it and speak out? ... Perhaps large protests are just being overlooked because we as viewers or the media is over it... I am just wondering why I haven&apos;t done more. Why does it seem as if people today (not just my &quot;generation&quot; or my &quot;community&quot;) are fearful or apathetic towards fighting for what they think is right? I don&apos;t want to preach or be dramatic here - I&apos;m not telling you to view things my/their/our/its/his/her way. I&apos;m just saying, I can&apos;t imagine that we&apos;ve gone through life without seeing some sort of injustice - there has to be something you&apos;ve seen that you think is wrong... why not say something about it? Is being charitable enough anymore? Awareness is key. Why is there this silence amongst us?&quot;\n\nPerhaps I&apos;m being too simplistic, but I&apos;ve often thought as a survivor of the Viet-Nam era, that the main reason we haven&apos;t seen protests of the magnitude depicted in The US vs John Lennon in recent times is simply the absence of the draft. Plenty of people again object to the war situation, but without the threat of involuntary servitude there simply is no critical mass. The fear of self, friends, and family being rounded up and shot proved great motivation to get people out in the streets back then. The censorship of the media imposed since Viet-Nam (embedded journalists, qv) has also helped still the voices.\n\nSo at the very least, this film has helped present an historical perspective all but absent in the present day. Viet-Nam so divided the country that the divisions remain today. Yet that war is curiously neglected in our educational curricula.\n\nBeyond that is revealed a portrait of John Lennon, artist and young man. Lennon, the single one of the Four who strove at great personal cost to better the world with far more than silly love songs is revealed here in a montage of film and stills that conveys far more than the press of the time was able or wiling to. \n\nThe film opens with footage from his 1971 appearance at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally at Crisler Area in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As a former UM Ann Arbor Student I particularly appreciate how the producers of the film illustrate the pivotal nature of that event. At the time the event seemed like a big deal locally, but one that was lost amongst the din of social commotion. As close as I was geographically, I didn&apos;t realize then just how influential Lennon&apos;s (or Sinclair&apos;s) involvement was in the successful movement to end the war.\n\nI suggest that any student (young or older) of how that peace movement progressed back then should see this film. Serious students should see it more than once. In addition to the collection of seldom seen film footage, there is a very fine sound track. See the film on the big screen if you can. I&apos;ll put my order in for the DVD as soon as it can be had, but the big screen, hi-fi version rocks.",

      "reviewBody": "before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.\n\nI know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn&apos;t do any better.\n\nLets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie&apos;s sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He&apos;s vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife&apos;s family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.\n\nSimilarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly&apos;s performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.\n\nThe two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn&apos;t? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.\n\nGiving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.\n\nKeira Knightley&apos;s swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley&apos;s portrayal is true to the original.\n\nAll in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie &apos;bewitched me body and soul&apos;. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving.",

(compared to other Hungarian movies ... ) The film is not only a really great comedy, but also gives an insight into the life of the 60&apos;s (in Hungary). Furthermore, the music makes it so much better!! We all know that the story is about a musician, Miklós Fenyo, who has lived in America, but his family had to move back to Hungary. I also must mention the actors, mainly Szabó Kimmel Tamás, who played so well. In my opinion, this comedy/musical contains everything what the genre requires; from the house party to the love. All in all, I really enjoyed every single part of the movie. That&apos;s why, I recommend it anyone, whatever age you are if you need distraction.\n\nWell done ;)",

      "reviewBody": "Acclaimed documentarian Fredrick Wiseman trains his notorious camera on the goings on of a hospital used primarily by people from a lower income bracket, and the results will likely sadden and horrify you.\n\nWiseman is always skilled at making you think he&apos;s being totally objective; it appears that he just turns his camera on and lets it run. However, he manages to construct a compelling indictment of how the poor are treated by the American medical industry and anyone with an ounce of warm blood in their veins will be enraged by what they see.\n\nThere are heartbreaking moments in this film, like doctors telling a woman she has only a limited amount of time to live and her complete unresponsiveness to the news. There are also moments that make you want to turn away from the screen, like the sight of a young man who&apos;s been given a purgative for a drug overdose spewing vomit all over the room, and then falling down in it. Indeed, much of this movie makes you feel guilty for watching at all. Shouldn&apos;t people&apos;s privacy and dignity be honored in situations like this? On the other hand, how would the majority of us know how the poor are treated if people like Wiseman didn&apos;t document it? The movie doesn&apos;t really pose and questions or answers, yet it manages to be completely compelling nonetheless. I saw it in a documentary film class and there was plenty of debate inspired by it.\n\nGrade: A",

In few others, though, did one of the buddies ever have as severe a drooling problem as Hooch.\n\nHanks, in one of his last few comedy roles before aiming strictly for Oscar-calibre movies, is perfection as a neat freak cop teamed with a pooch that would be a calamity no matter whom he was with.  When this dog marks his territory, the whole neighborhood notices.\n\nIf there&apos;s only one problem I had, it was the ending.  I won&apos;t say anything about it, for the uninitiated, but all I will say is I wish it would have ended differently.\n\nBut besides Hanks and hound, there are other good parts, such as the observances of the unique characters in the town, the extent of damage a mastiff can do, and what kind of a cop carries a Dustbuster in his car. Oh, and the Lancelot Link discussion.\n\nSeven stars.  And if you ever own a mastiff, get thick doors."

He decides to have a big party and invite his friends from college that he hasn&apos;t seen in years.As it turns out, everyone has their problems. Roger and Mary have just lost a child,Maggie is trying to find a man and has her eye on Peter, who is definitely not interested,Sarah is involved with a married man and seems to have trouble getting involved with anyone who&apos;s available,Andrew and his Hollywood actress wife are having marriage problems.This movie is well acted, the script is well written,thanks to Rita Rudner and her husband Martin Bergman and the casting is excellent. Starring Stephen Fry as Peter,Kenneth Branagh as Andrew,Hugh Laurie as Roger,Emma Thompson as Maggie,Alphonsia Emmanuel as Sarah and Imelda Staunton as Mary.With Rita Rudner as Carol.",

      "reviewBody": "The expectations from this movie were definitely really high because the legendary Kapoor girl was about to appear on the big screen after taking a sabbatical of 6 years and in real means almost 9 years. With names like Karishma Kapoor and Vikram Bhatt people expect DI to be an enthralling experience all around. And to me it did prove to be a path breaking movie. The prowess with which Karishma carries this tough role on her shoulders, she deserves a big laud and many accolades in the end year award functions. The direction is way too good and i can assure that it is Bhatt&apos;s best work after Raaz. Though the 3D work is good quality but apologetically there is no much scope for 3D effects. The film could have been made without 3D as well. Storyline and Final Verdict! Movie is about past life regression and hallucinations. If you don&apos;t believe in such things, this movie would make you believe in reincarnation of true lovers. Such a flawless love story, it deserve 8 stars and an additional star for Karishma&apos;s to date best performance after Zubeidaa! Go for it!",

      "reviewBody": "Until now MERRY-GO-ROUND has been one of those silent films more talked about than seen. This was the movie that producer Irving Thalberg fired Erich von Stroheim from halfway through the shooting. Director Rupert Julian (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) replaced him and got sole credit. Thalberg would leave Universal after this and go to MGM where he would later cut von Stroheim&apos;s most famous film GREED to a little over 2 hours thereby eliminating two-thirds of the movie. Viewing this film 100 years after the fact, MERRY-GO-ROUND has much to recommend it.\n\nErich von Stroheim&apos;s hand is still very much in evidence from the opulent settings of the Austrian aristocracy to the use of two members of his stock company, Dale Fuller and Cesare Gravina. The real revelation here is Mary Philbin best known for PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. Here she demonstrates greater acting ability then in any other of her surviving films. She does tend to go a little over the top near the end of the film which is no doubt the fault of director Julian who according to Lon Chaney encouraged his performers to overact in PHANTOM. Norman Kerry, a dependable leading man from the silent era, gives his usual fine performance but the acting honors go to veteran villian George Siegmann (BIRTH OF A NATION) and especially George Hackathorne as the hunchback Bartholemew.\n\nThe story of an Austrian nobleman who falls in love with a woman outside his social class would be remade by von Stroheim in 1928 as THE WEDDING MARCH. This DVD transfer comes from two surviving 16mm prints which feature the original color tints and the elaborately illustrated title cards. The quality of the transfer considering the source is excellent. I&apos;ve never seen 16mm look this good before. The new musical accompaniment is taken from the original 1923 cue sheets. If you&apos;re a fan of Erich von Stroheim or silent films in general then you&apos;ll want to take a ride on this MERRY-GO-ROUND...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic."

      "reviewBody": "Great story, great cast. I think this is a very underrated movie, unfortunately i&apos;ve noticed so few people seem to have really enjoyed it.  It&apos;s a typical 90&apos;s indie movie, with odd characters and something to say, not the usual blockbuster automatic pilot. For me, it mainly shows the contrast of our childhood and teenage beliefs from the adultwood letdowns, when we have to deal with petty stuff like money and how to make a living. Our  60&apos;s rock stars, for instance, could be represented by the Dennis Hopper character, only interested nowadays with the movie producer&apos;s wallet and the money he can offer for his book&apos;s rights. And the bored grown up kid, leading a tedious life as an executive, trying to get rid of his yuppie routine by following the book&apos;s rules by every word,  even if it means killing someone. For him, that&apos;s a breakthrough of some sort. Christopher Walken in one of his best maniac performances. I&apos;d love to see another David Salle&apos;s incursion into moviemaking."

      "name": "Tony Scott and Denzel Washington reteam for an update on a thriller classic that while technically proficient feels like it&apos;s missing something",
      "reviewBody": "On the New York City Subway, four men armed men lead by Ryder (John Travolta) hijack a train car of 19 passengers from train Pelham 123 (so named because of its departure time and origin station). As the train car is stopped in the subway tunnel it wreaks havoc upon the rest of the subway system. Train Dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) makes contact with Ryder who demands $10 million ransom in exchange for the passengers.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 123 is the third adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Godey following the classic Joseph Sargent directed 1974 film and a mostly forgotten 1998 TV movie. The film was Denzel Washington&apos;s fourth collaboration with Tony Scott following their work on Crimson Tide, Man on Fire, and Déjà vu and as such was positioned as a blockbuster for the 2009 Summer movie season. Opening in third place behind holdovers of hit films Up and The Hangover, The Taking of Pelham 123 was seen as a &quot;soft&quot; opener for the $100 million project but eventually legged out to $150 million worldwide which while not great was far from terrible. The movie received mixed reviews with critics praising the technical aspects of the film as well as the performances, but also feeling that Tony Scott&apos;s frenetic direction didn&apos;t really mesh with the material and it was inferior to the 1974 original film. In the end this update of Pelham 123 does try to do something different, but it doesn&apos;t do so all that successfully.\n\nMuch like the original 1974 film, this version of Pelham 123 also serves as a time capsule of New York City substituting the 70s recession era atmosphere of the original for a New York City that has been redefined in the aftermath of 9/11 and of course the then recent financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. With Scott&apos;s direction having a few too many flourishes that his audience will be all too familiar with, sometimes it feels like New York City&apos;s identity isn&apos;t as well established as it could be and it feels like there&apos;s more focus on &quot;how&quot; it&apos;s being shot in place of &quot;what&apos;s&quot; being shot. In particular I felt as though the boarding sequence in the first act was overly truncated and I felt like the hijackers with the exception of Travolta&apos;s Ryder felt greatly diminished as characters with none of them allowed to leave much of an impression. Denzel Washington plays our substitute for Zachary Garber from the original film in Walter Garber who unlike the original transit cop character is a train dispatcher so he&apos;s out of his element and there&apos;s also an added subplot involving how he got moved from a higher level position down to dispatch. In principal I like the idea of where they take the Garber character but the execution is where I feel it stumbles because they try to make Ryder and Garber parallels of each other in a &quot;we&apos;re not so different, you and me&quot; that leads to a very overwrought standoff moment serving as the climax that I just feel doesn&apos;t work. This incarnation of the film takes itself much more seriously, and while there are shades of humor such as with James Gandolfini&apos;s performance as the mayor of New York or the occasional exchanges among the passengers the movie feels like it has excised a good amount of the original film&apos;s humor which was a key appeal of its identity including its stinger ending involving a sneeze.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 123 is perfectly serviceable as a time killer and Travolta and Denzel do solid work but I think Tony Scott&apos;s direction isn&apos;t all that conducive to what is mostly a chamber piece and it feels like Scott has tried to &quot;energize&quot; his direction to compensate for the contained nature of the story. If you want to see a Tony Scott train movie that works with his style instead of against it I&apos;d recommend 2010&apos;s Unstoppable because the story of a runaway train meshed better with Scott&apos;s directorial style.",

Fact is though, you can&apos;t just relax and let the images just take you away. You have to stay with the story. But it&apos;s not hard to stay with the movie, because you have to charismatic leads. Roberts and Owen are great and even the small roles are cast perfectly.\n\nThe wit, the humor, the dialogue, the twists ... just everything works smoothly. A really cool twisty spy thriller with actors that play off each other!",

      "reviewBody": "Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.\n\nOur story deals with a previously home-schooled girl (Lohan) now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world, but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The &quot;Plastics&quot; as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes, the more miserable her life becomes, however.\n\nThe film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes, but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days, but things seem even more fragmented now.\n\nTina Fey has written an intelligent script, and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming, but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film, and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it&apos;s safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I&apos;ve ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning, and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall, there did not seem to be any casting problems.\n\nMark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace, and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels&apos; name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I&apos;ve heard, the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an R-rating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals, though! After watching this film, I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol, and behaved much the same way as the &quot;Plastics.&quot; Only back then (88-91) it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair, the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....\n\n9 of 10 stars for Mean Girls. Too bad I never had any math teachers as pretty as Tina Fey!",

      "reviewBody": "German produced Westerns made in the former Yugoslavia during the 1960s are a pet favorite. The long running &quot;Winnetou&quot; series with Tarzan actor Lex Barker were as popular in Europe as the James Bond films, or any other semi-serial of related features. The best known examples of the Schnitzel Western form, they have an unreal quality about them, set in uniquely decorated East European hill country with rock formations even more bizarre in appearance to those used for locations by the Spaghetti Western directors in Spain. &quot;The new old west&quot; is what Roger Ebert called the look. North American Westerns all look the same, no offense intended. European made Westerns look like Star Trek episodes in comparison: &quot;Fake&quot;, confined to tightly claustrophobic sets, populated by actors costumed for style rather than authenticity.\n\nThis is a pretty smooth one. &quot;Sampson/Hercules&quot; actor Brad Harris plays the secret agent who rides into a bloody landscape torn apart by Comanche raids on frontier settlements as reprisal for having traditional Native lands taken away by a would-be oil baron who sets up the U.S. Cavalry to take the fall for him. Or any other caucasians who happen by, the story opening with a massacre which would have been wholly unacceptable for American audiences in 1965. The film is brutally violent yet it&apos;s cartoon violence rather than the bloody carnage of a Peckinpah. The look mimics the American productions which inspired the Italian, French and German filmmakers who churned these things out for a decade until the fad dried out once it devolved into self-parody.\n\nThis one may not have the style or panache of a sumptuous Sergio Leone or Corbucci epic, instead still rooted in the Experimental era of the EuroWestern form prior to the grubby unwashed look of the Classic era productions. These helped set the tone, and gets the job over and done with quickly, with little time for remorse for the dead or character development. They are archetypes, roles crafted to check off list items on the formulary of Western films. Harris&apos; tough-guy persona is well served by the role he plays, a youngish Horst Frank is enjoyable as his counterpart, and Euro Horror actor Tony Kendall is just swarthy enough to be cast as an Indian Chief without eliciting too many guffaws. \n\nFor that matter the Native Americans are regarded with surprising sympathy by the filmmakers, scoring plot points by having the Cavalry and despotic white men who drive the plot as the bad guys, their savage reprisals somehow understandable. The establishment of the Anti Hero was the great contribution by the Euro&apos;s to the idiom, and indeed contemporary viewers will be surprised at how &quot;modern&quot; the film feels in this unblemished English version presented by the awesome Wu Tang Collection of restored European produced Westerns.\n\nThe results may lack the sweeping epic feel of the &quot;Winnetou&quot; fans but was skillfully filmed in widescreen and has a passable twangy electric guitar vibrato music score which will please those who admire such things. Not as plaintively mournful as a Paella-flavored Spaghetti Western score and closer to popular music forms than an operatic Morricone concoction. In fact I&apos;ll say that the film is charming just by having less at stake than a grim, sweaty Italo Western, instead playing a cool, calculated and streamlined game of make-believe which reminds me so much of playing Cowboys &amp; Indians as a kid. That&apos;s why we watch em, period authenticity be damned.",

Yet, the enthusiastic performance of the actors make this a good watch\n\nThe insane passion of the male lead and the off-beat, yet refreshing characterisation of the female lead makes the movie enjoyable.",

Then reduce the length of the second half which is a bit disjointed, and you don&apos;t always know why the characters are doing what they decide to do. Gets a bit random, to be honest.

You need some Beautiful women to take there cloths off, of course, and a good cinematographer helps a lot as well. The Pictures are well lit and what you see of the women isn&apos;t bad - but that&apos;s it. No original thought here, in fact no thought whatsoever. That&apos;s why BS-artists are BS-artists - they basically have nothing to say about anything. There heads are a black hole from which nothing of value can escape. Robbe-Grillet and others of his ilk give film a bad name. Trintignant could be good - he proved that in other films.

      "reviewBody": "Perfectly awful peplum/Hercules-movie: you know you&apos;re in trouble when leading lady Jayne Mansfield&apos;s prominent bust (forever on the verge of bursting through her togas) commands greater attention than the plot, the action or the special effects!; of course, the fact that the muscular hero is played by her real-life husband – Mickey Hargitay – adds to the fun quotient (of the unintentional kind, that is)for rarely has there ever been an actor so clueless as to how to approach this mythical part! \n\nUsually seen as a blonde, Mansfield here dons a black and a red wig: she appears as a couple of sovereigns – the heroine and an Amazonian (though the latter is technically played by another actress who takes up Mansfield&apos;s appearance via a magic potion in order to ensnare Hargitay). Of mild interest is the fact that the latter has a penchant of disposing of her lovers by having them turned into living trees – as if one needed further proof of how wooden this thing could be, the plot here takes it to a literal level! The chief villainous role in this one is entrusted to Massimo Serato, often a reliable presence in this type of flick, but in this case sporting long curly hair – which only serves to enhance the film&apos;s overriding camp factor. Also in the cast, as one of Serato&apos;s advisors, is Giulio Donnini from the obscure peplum FRINE, CORTIGIANA D&apos;ORIENTE (1953) – which I watched as part of last month&apos;s &quot;Epic Movie Challenge&quot; (in time for the Easter period); incidentally, I had intended to rent the 5-Disc/7-Film set among which this was included back then but it wasn&apos;t available.\n\nBy the way, THE LOVES OF HERCULES was also known as HERCULES VS. THE HYDRA: this monster, which appears fairly early on in the game, is one of the worst of its kind ever constructed – what&apos;s the point of having a three-headed menace if lopping one of them off kills it instantly! Indeed, the mechanical creation is so bulky that it can barely move and so obviously fake that one is liable to burst out laughing at the mere sight of it, as I did, thus effectively destroying the illusion of the entire scene! Another hilarious obstacle the hero has to overcome during the course of the film is a meek-looking cow absurdly sprayed black by the penny-pinching film-makers in a lousy attempt to pass it off for a menacing bull!",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t understand why this movie isn&apos;t more well known or why it doesn&apos;t get more critical applause. Well, I suppose it&apos;s in black and white, it&apos;s short, it has no expensive bankable stars, and no love interest. I can&apos;t think of any other reasons, because this is a very good movie indeed. John Huston&apos;s direction is outstanding, while still being understated. When he was uninterested, Huston could do a merely pedestrian job. But he must have been interested in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; from beginning to end. \n\nExample from the beginning: a group of soldiers are gathered around a speaker who is spreading rumors about a coming battle, most of their backs turned to us. The camera slowly moves in towards the small crowd, not the speaker, but the backs of the listeners&apos; heads, and one of the soldiers turns around towards the camera and steps quickly into a close up with an expression of deep self-doubt. What a way to introduce Audie Murphy as Henry Fleming! What a way to individuate a mob of naive young men! \n\nExample from the end: Henry and his friend Tom, played by Bill Mauldin, are marching away from the battlefield, still alive, and a bit surprised. Tom says something about how the birds are beginning to sing again, and Henry agrees that as soon as the smoke and noise of battle end it doesn&apos;t take the birds long to get worked up again. Henry looks upward over his shoulder, and Huston gives us a point-of-view shot of a hazy sun drifting dimly through the tops of the trees that tower alongside the road. The cast could hardly do better. It is Audie Murphy&apos;s best performance by far. In &quot;To Hell and Back,&quot; in which he played himself, he wasn&apos;t required to do much more than rudimentary acting, and the film itself is cliché ridden. Here, Murphy convinces us that he&apos;s worried, or scared, or hijacked by his amygdala, or whatever the situation calls for. His boyish voice is completely appropriate to the role, as is his overall appearance. He seems to have really given this movie some effort. Bill Mauldin as Tom is also surprisingly good. He was undoubtedly the most famous and most controversial cartoonist of World War II and spent a good deal of time with Murphy&apos;s Third Division in Italy. He may not be a trained actor, but his sincerity, his gawky face and outlandish ears are more convincing than, say, Tab Hunter&apos;s brawn ever was. All of the supporting cast are excellent, particularly John Dierkes as the dying soldier. \n\nDo you want to have your hair raised? Read Steven Crane&apos;s original novel. He was 22 when he wrote it, years after the Civil War had ended, but no one would know it from the novel, which has the ring of reminiscence about it. The scene of the dying soldier as he actually dies, standing and trembling from head to foot as if in some Jacksonian fit, is unforgettable in its horror. It&apos;s impossible to identify the battle on which the book was based, if indeed there was any. \n\nLet&apos;s face facts. The North lost damned near all of its most dramatic battles, and not through the fault of its soldiers or junior officers. (General Winterside&apos;s cognomen must have been influenced by the real-life General Ambrose Burnside, for whom our &quot;sideburns&quot; are named. Burnside was one of Lincoln&apos;s worst generals and had the good sense and the courage to admit it himself.} The Penninsular campaign, fought under MacLellan, another real hard-charging fire eater, was a dismal failure and ended in an ignominious retreat Crane was from New Jersey and is now buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Hillside, having died a young man. One can only wonder what he might have accomplished had he written more than just two novels. The photography may be black and white but it&apos;s splendidly done. I find the only two problems, and they&apos;re relatively minor ones, involve the production itself. This isn&apos;t back East where the war was fought. This is clearly California, with scattered live oak trees dark and evergreen against the dried summer bunch grass. And the musical score is generic, adding little to the picture aside from the expected Battle Hymn of the Republic and triumphant marches in major keys. A fine picture, all around.",

      "reviewBody": "This spaghetti western is one which seems to be surprisingly obscure. I&apos;ve no real idea why this should be but it&apos;s certainly not an inferior product anyway. Admittedly, it really brings nothing new to the table but it delivers the usual ingredients in a perfectly decent enough manner. It revolves around three characters of a type that populate countless Italian westerns - a loner with amazing weapons skills, an unscrupulous banker and a dangerous yet lovable Mexican bandit. While its setting of a small town under the rule of immoral criminals, who are only set free with the help of a slightly less amoral character, is a scenario that has been told umpteen times. But sometimes more of the same is okay and, well, this is more of the same there&apos;s no doubt about that.\n\nThe title character is a debt collector called Durango played by Brad Harris. It does have to be said that he seems extremely ill suited to play a character such as this in a western. This muscle-bound actor replete with impressive six-pack seems out of place here, and would be better suited to action movies and peplums. He also lacks much in the way of charisma and so this tree trunk of a man is miscast in my view. The other characters are a bit better, although the chap who played the evil banker seemed a little too Latin to really convince as a character called Ferguson! Still, these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things and you&apos;d be correct to wonder just why in hell I am even complaining about them. I&apos;m wondering that too and I&apos;ve just written them. No, the most important thing is that this film takes us from A to B on a well-worn spaghetti western path and it does it successfully, if unadventurously. It&apos;s certainly a film that deserves to be more widely seen though and is ultimately another successfully entertaining bit of Italian Americana.",

      "reviewBody": "A striking, powerful follow up and companion piece to the epic 4 hour &quot;The Traveling Players&quot;, Angelopolous further refines his complex visual style, jumping backwards and forwards in time, often, remarkably all in the same shot. (There are several very long takes here that are simply astounding, tracking us right out of the 1970s into the1960s and then the 1940s and back again).\n\nA group of hunters in 1977 find a communist revolutionary, dressed in period clothing, freshly shot to death in the snow. But how can this be? All the Communists were executed or exiled back in 1949. \n\nThe subsequent surreal exploration of the past and present – of each character and of Greece itself – is a challenging statement on guilt, denial, moral confusion and self- deception. \n\nThis may be the best of all Andropolous&apos; films at making multiple time periods dance together in the same scenes, often in the same shot, sometimes in the same frame (!). He uses cinema in a unique way to examine how the past shapes the present, and how we in the present re-shape the past in our memories. \n\nAnd while this is all quite serious, the film also has a bleak sense of humor that shows its head now and again. \n\nA difficult, but tremendously rewarding film. \n\nNote: There seem to be two versions of the film in existence, both supposedly &apos;approved&apos; by the director. A 143 minute version (available on the new Artificial eye Andropoulos box set) and a longer 168 minute version, which I have not been able to find with subtitles, although there are non-subtitled Japanese and Chinese DVDs. This review is based on the Artificial Eye version.",

Their odysseys converge, and when their arrival in Mexico coincides with the Juarez revolt, they decide that the good old US of A provides better choices than these pesky foreigners after all.\n\nCharacteristically folksy Western, the Undefeated has a lively supporting cast, great camera work by William Clothier, and a very inspiring idea, exploring the relation between the former Union and Confederate post-civil war, and they realise they have something in common.\n\nIt&apos;s a good western, a bit slumbering in places, especially in the first half, then after that moves briskly. It&apos;s got a mix of action (horse stampede at the end is exciting), humour and drama, but it&apos;s the two stars The duke and Rock Hudson that carry the film. Both actors are like chalk and cheese, but they work well together. The romantic subplot can be a bit contrived, though.\n\nThere&apos;s a great one liner: &quot;The conversation sorta dried up, ma&apos;am&quot; when a lady asks him why they stopped the conversation and shot the bandit.",

      "reviewBody": "François Truffaut continues the story of Antoine Doinel, the alter ego of Jean-Pierre Léaud, 9 years after the groundbreaking THE 400 BLOWS (1959), the rebellious boy has reached the adolescence, still rebellious though, he is discharged from his military service for being unruly, the comic vibe is established from the very start by the juxtaposition of the dead-serious officer and a laughter-repressed Antoine, who turns out to be a street-smart young man in spite of a tough childhood, and his parents have been completely evacuated out of his life (without any explanation). The first place he visits is a whorehouse, then stops by his girlfriend Christine Darbon (Jade), but is told she is out on a ski vacation by her genial parents (Ceccaldi and Duhamel), but Truffaut slyly implies that there seems to be something else on Christine&apos;s agenda now.\n\nAntoine finds a job as a night porter in a hotel in Paris, thanks to Christine&apos;s father&apos;s recommendation, a comely Christine visits him one night, she greets him on the new job and seems casually happy but not so enthusiastic. Soon he is fired for being an unwitting helper of a private detective Henri (Harry-Max), who instead introduces him to the new exciting line of business managed by Monsieur Blady (Falcon). Antoine starts his new vocation with great passion although his stalking skill is a far cry from professional. Truffaut&apos;s perspicacious insight of urban savvy is brought to the fore in this segment, mainly surrounding two cases, a subtle love triangle about a (closeted) man looking for his magician lover and a more detailed inside-job, where Antoine is assigned to undercover in a shoe shop owned by Georges Tabard (Lonsdale, a great scene-stealer), who wants the agency to find out why he is so disliked by everyone around him, but the irony is that during Georges&apos; loquacious introduction of his background, the reason behind that is pretty crystal-clear. During the course, Antoine is hopelessly having a crush with Georges&apos; wife Fabienne (Seyrig, enigmatic and fabulously seductive), the apotheosis of a woman&apos;s sheer perfection. He is torn between his unquenchable fascination to Fabienne and the on-and-off relationship with Christine, which extracts the most vehement outburst in the mirror scenes where Antoine&apos;s unfitting characteristic is pungently reflected, with the iterations of self-persuasion and self-boost, to no avail. Eventually after tasting the temptation, which costs him the second job, he reconciles with Christine in the cutesy chapter where he works as a TV repairman, but the uncertainty of his own feelings becomes more pronounced in the coda, where a stalker makes a wanton confession to Christine in the presence of Antoine, both dismiss at him on the spot, but think twice, it is the capriciousness of love and emotions that will certainly puzzle Antoine, and trigger every viewer, to discover what will happen to him and Christine later, aka. in BED &amp; BOARD (1970), approximately after a two-years spell.\n\nSTOLEN KISSES is charming in its carefree tempo and disarming in its frankness about whimsical triviality, it is not a major or challenging piece of work from Truffaut, but still scintillates with the profundity of a intelligent life-observer, an obliging humorist and an inspiring filmmaker.",

This is an enjoyable, humorous, ironic, feel-good movie... you surely won&apos;t have to apologize for crude language or over-the-top violence in any scene (well, you will have to get used to Demi&apos;s full length blonde hair, and after &quot;G.

Having Dick Shawn along for the ride doesn&apos;t hurt either. I smile just thinking about it. Artie Johnson is also an excellent Renfield.

They are all dressed in tuxedos going to Jesse&apos;s wedding with Hope (Drew Barrymore). Billy is dropped off at the bank who turns out to be the masked bandit Hamlet. Then the rest of the guys go into the bank. They are surprised by Billy&apos;s bank robbery, and join in. Sheriff Phillips (Fred Ward) surrounds the group, and turns out to be Billy&apos;s dad.\n\nThis is a poor copy of &apos;Dog Day Afternoon&apos;. Billy is way too pathetic. The FBI is way too ridiculous. The other people in the group makes no sense. It&apos;s trying to be a quirky action comedy. Except that it&apos;s more stupid than funny. And it&apos;s a horrible idea to have Andy Dick who is hamming it up for the camera. I think the filmmakers are attempting at a Tarantino-like DDA movie but they don&apos;t have the skills to pull it off. It comes off as a weak homage to the great movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Sydney Pollack&apos;s return to the western four years after THE SCALPHUNTERS was to be a completely different experience. Following the trials and tribulations of a deserter of the Mexican War who disappears in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to become a mountain man, JEREMIAH JOHNSON eschews the conventions of the western as a genre in such a way as was only made possible for American cinema in the tumultuous era of early 70&apos;s with such visceral movies of frontier survival as MAN IN THE WILDERNESS and A MAN CALLED HORSE paving the way. \n\nAs Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) wanders the mountains like a fugitive stricken by disaster, a solitary figure against awe-inspiring backdrops of massive rock formations, steep ravines and expansive mesas, you can tangibly feel the film, like the hero, transcending the specific time and place and breaching out vision to become an all-encompassing spiritual journey where the individual characters - fur trappers, bear hunters or Indians - are merely the unwitting parners in a dance of death.\n\nSome viewers may be put off by the lack of straight-forward plot, the episodic, repetitive nature of the movie or the long stretches of silence, but it&apos;s from those exact things the movie takes its power. JJ comes unto its own in those small moments of quietude, in Johnson&apos;s silent encounters with indians, in the barren, unforgiving wastes of the craggy mountains that reflect so well the psychology of characters wandering in their shadow, in the subtle, heartwarming interactions Johnson has with the Indian woman he&apos;s taken for a wife and the mute boy he&apos;s taken for a son. There&apos;s hardly a word uttered between this peculiar family the entire movie but the ways they learn to overcome the barriers that separate them is a touching sight to behold.\n\nThere is some dated montage, a corny soundtrack; how much of this will affect your enjoyment will boil down to your affinity with how cinema was in the 70&apos;s. Still, what is left is this beautiful parable of broken humans learning to be whole again. Equal parts visceral, savage and heartwarming."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;How to Rob a Bank&quot; is a low-budget oddity in which a young private citizen (Nick Stahl) gets accidentally locked in a bank vault with a hot-and-sexy would-be robber (Erika Christensen). The trick is it&apos;s hard to tell whose side young Jinx is really on - the bank robbers&apos; who are holding the employees and customers hostage on the other side of the steel door, or the cops&apos;, led by Officer Degepse (Terry Crews of &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;), who are stuck outside the bank trying to defuse the situation. Jinx is a customer mightily ticked off at how banks literally nickel-and-dime their depositors at every opportunity - and it is anger at this outrage that may inspire him to shift his loyalties to the malefactors in the final stretch.\n\nWritten and directed by Andrews Jenkins, the movie earns more points for creativity than it does for execution. The story is often needlessly gimmicky and confusing, the direction unpolished and lacking in finesse, and the performances low on subtlety and shading (though Stahl is very good). Plus, what with its made-on-the-cheap appearance, collection of pseudo-profundities and single-set mise-en-scene, &quot;How to Rob a Bank&quot; definitely has a film-school-project feel to it.\n\nStill, it&apos;s kind of fun watching the movie turn the bank-robbery formula on its head, particularly in its blurring of the lines between the hostages and the hostage-takers, the law-breakers and the law-enforcers. Plus, for a little added kick, it has the late David Carradine appearing in a cameo role right at the closing moments.",

Much the same idea had already been used in a US film, Douglas Fairbanks&apos; Flirting with Fate in 1916. The strength of this film is not therefore in its story nor in the writing in itself (which is relatively not very special) so much as in the general organization of the film (mise en scène, sound, scenery, acting style) which is absolutely outstanding.\n\nTo appreciate how good it is, just look at a version for the same story that Neubach himself directed in 1952 (Man lebt nur einmal). Despite the fact that Neubach employed set designer Emil Hasler who had worked on some classics of the Weimar period (inc. M and The Blue Angel) and on the excellent 1943 film Münchhausen, it is a very, very ordinary and uninteresting farce and, frankly, painfully unfunny. It was simply impossible in fifties Germany to create the style of the brilliant pre-war years (as Fritz Lang would also discover on his return). Neubach had actually made the film in exile in France too in 1949 as On demande un assassin with Fernandel but this I have not seen.\n\nThis is not a silent film but belongs to a special category of film for which as far as I know we have no name - films made in the thirties that employed sound (often, as here, in very interesting and inventive ways) not primarily for the purpose of dialogue (which is often minimal) or as incidental score but as an element of mise en scène (a part simply of the general ambiance of the film) while still retaining the visual values of silent films. Apart from the entirely exceptional case of Chaplin (Modern Times) this was a style unknown in the US - Von Sternberg is to some extent an exception - and US films that hesitate involuntarily between &quot;silent&quot; and &quot;sound&quot; are simply badly made films (poor sound quality, stilted over-enunciated dialogue, too much dialogue etc). \n\nBut there are some very fine and important examples pf this &quot;mixed style&quot; both in France (Clair&apos;s 1931 À nous la liberté is a perfect example as well as being an influence on Chaplin) and in Germany. The style is associated to some extent with the great directors of the silent era (Jean Epstein for instance) but also, more surprisingly, with a younger generation who had only just started making films at the end of that era (like the Siodmak or Clair or Machaty in Czechoslovakia) and in some cases with film-makers who had never made a silent film (Jean Vigo for instance in France). It can also be observed less markedly but to some extent in the great classics of these years (M, The Blue Angel, La Chienne). It is a style, in other words, that produced some of the greatest masterpieces of cinema.\n\nRobert and Curt Siodmak and Billy Wilder as a team, until their enforced departure for the US, proved unsurprisingly real artists in the genre, having also produced the wonderful silent masterpiece Menschen am Sonntag the year before this.\n\nEven if we are missing the beginning of the film explaining why the central character wishes to kill himself, this film still stands as a fine example of this mixed style of the early thirties. Beautiful expressionistic sets (something of a revival by this time in Germany), mildly stylized acting (in fact, more accurately a typical mix of the stylized and the naturalistic), superbly ironic use of sound.\n\nHad the rise of Hitler not destroyed he German film industry, the style might have survived as a natural bridge between the golden age of European film in the late twenties and the &quot;new wave&quot; of the sixties. It does to a certain extent in French &quot;poetic realism&quot; (early Renoir, Carné etc) and in the films of Sacha Guitry but in Germany it died the death while the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians fleeing to the US had no choice but to accept the more banal strictures of US &quot;realist&quot; style.\n\nAs is also the case with silent films, later ill-advised &quot;sound&quot; remakes of &quot;mixed style&quot; films are nearly always inferior, and often vastly inferior, to the originals."

It is not an all time great masterpiece, of course, mostly because of its imperfect, but still very good directing (actually it was  debut work of this film&apos;s director). However, that is well forgivable regarding awesome music and stunning performance by Viktor Avilov, who is as great in this role, as no one could ever be. The movie perfectly conveys the atmosphere of Russian Decadence, the cultural phenomenon, which is also called &quot;The Silver Age&quot; of Russian culture. It was a period since approx. 1905 till the beginning of WW1 in 1914. To understand what it was you must have a cultural experience of being a Russian. You have to feel its beautiful enigmatic spirit in poetry, prose, music and painting of that era, penetrated with troubled anticipation of great changes to come. Having seen this film, you will be haunted by this atmosphere - only if you are able to tune yourself to its wavelength. If you are a fan of scary movies like &quot;Hellraiser&quot; or &quot;Elm street Nightmare&quot; - just skip it. There is nothing in Western cinema to be compared with this. It must be emotionally experienced to say whether you like it or not, depending on your personal emotional constitution. As for myself, this film is rather a philosophic story about an artist, who dared to challenge the God and was punished for that. It bears a powerful emotional impact, amplified by times by the great music score.\n\n I give the movie 10/10, forgiving flaws of directing.",

This is a high octane film with wall to wall style, and featuring some nasty violence, a lot of it directed at young women; Western audiences not used to seeing men casually beat women&apos;s faces in, might be a little uncomfortable, but for those of us used to CAT 111 Hong Kong cinema, this won&apos;t be new territory. I saw &quot;Hard Romantik&quot; as a kind of &apos;primer&apos; for harder, more adult gangster films like &quot;Ichi the Killer.&quot; But this is a solid, highly entertaining delinquent/gangster movie in it&apos;s own right, and I am surprised that it is not more well-known.",

      "reviewBody": "Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first &quot;big&quot; film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.\n\nIf we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na&apos;vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I&apos;m seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.\n\nIn 3D it doesn&apos;t quite hit the same mark for me. The &quot;look it&apos;s in 3D&quot; shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn&apos;t aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about &quot;how did they do that shot&quot; while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I&apos;ll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as &quot;Unobtainium&quot; and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn&apos;t ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.\n\nThe cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana&apos;s performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is &quot;so-so&quot;, Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn&apos;t add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.\n\nOverall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these."

      "name": "Romance and rivalry between two classical pianists",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been quite a few years since I&apos;ve seen this movie so forget all the details, but remember it more as an engrossing character study than a romance...and all with the added attraction of the classical piano context. The story is set at a prestigious piano competition in San Francisco. Paul is considered an older contestant at age 25. This is his last chance for a prestigious win that will spare him a teaching career and also please the father who is so proud of his son. Heidi is the lovely young newcomer virtuoso who poses his major competition. Winning is much more crucial here to Paul than to Heidi. Not unexpectedly, romantic feelings develop between the two rivals, who must both strive to be at their peak for the competition performances.\n\nThe lead roles are well cast with Richard Dreyfuss portraying the talented but desperate musician, Paul, and Amy Irving his gifted &amp; more relaxed competitor, Heidi. I was impressed at the finger synching method used during the piano performances. Though not a musician myself, it seemed convincing to me that these actors were actually playing the pieces. I&apos;ve remembered all these years that it was a Prokofiev Concerto that Heidi played so brilliantly. Lee Remick is Heidi&apos;s teacher, Gretchen, a possessive and demanding taskmaster who naturally does not approve of the budding romance.\n\nThe movie is not limited simply to rivals Paul and Heidi, but an assortment of other admittedly rather stereotypical competitors are also featured. This is a drama depicting in general the tension, rivalry, ambition, disappointment &amp; triumph of high stakes competition, whatever the field. Therefore, the themes are something a lot of viewers, even non musicians, can relate to in one way or another. Of course there is a question of potential sacrifice here, as these two competitors have fallen in love. Whatever the chemistry between Paul &amp; Heidi, the romance itself is quite forgettable. The fierce competition rivalry and the backdrop of classical piano are the memorable elements that distinguish this film from all the other love stories out there. This is a must see movie for pianists and indeed all classical music lovers.",

I remember when I was younger getting a peek at the movie on HBO, but I think I remember falling asleep, so it was at least something I could put to rest of what the rest of the movie was about. Candyman 3: Day of the Dead turned out to be an ordinary sequel with nothing to remember and it wasn&apos;t up to par with the original Candyman.\n\nCaroline, the great great grand daughter of Candyman, is still haunted by the dreams of what her family and Candyman had to go through. No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame. She tries to uncover the legend and figure out what he wants from her, but she might end up loosing the only true friend of her&apos;s.\n\nThis film was sadly typical and even for a horror movie it was plain pathetic, I do like a little cheesiness every once in a while, but for a great story like Candyman, this was really sad. Well, I can see why they didn&apos;t make a fourth installment to the Candyman series, big surprise there. Well, at least I&apos;m done... or am I? *Insert cynical laughter here* \n\n2/10",

      "reviewBody": "Oscar-winning Disney documentary, directed by James Algar, about life in the Arctic (filmed in Canada). As with the other Disney nature documentaries I&apos;ve seen from this period, the beautiful photography of the scenery and wildlife is what makes this worth recommending. There&apos;s exciting footage of rushing rivers and glaciers breaking apart and playful footage of polar bears playing, etc. Oliver Wallace&apos;s excellent score compliments the action well. A good thing, too, as Winston Hibler&apos;s monotone narration can be sleep-inducing. There have been many similar television and film documentaries in the decades since this was made but the footage here is so good it still manages to impress. Some scenes were staged, including the unpalatable &apos;lemming suicide&apos; scene. Today, where discussions of the environment are concerned, there are inevitable axes to grind and flags to be raised. What&apos;s refreshing about seeing older docs, such as White Wilderness, is that they are just trying to provide a look at nature&apos;s many wonders in an informative and entertaining way. There&apos;s no agenda. Some elements may be dated but, for the most part, this is still a great documentary with lovely nature photography that should please most viewers.",

Long lets the old man carry all the supplies in a huge pack. The old man also has the only ice axe. Col.Long just walks along following the old man. Just when you get feeling good and sorry for the tired old man, he slips and falls. It looks like a broken leg, and Col. Long is forced to leave the old man to spend the night alone on a narrow ledge. Does Col. Long provide first aid or pick up the pack or the ice axe? - No, he continues on his quest so he can get there before dark. I won&apos;t spoil the ending, but Col. Long does not have any emergency provisions when he faces it.\n\nThe rest of the movie is just as dumb, the unspecial effects are lame, and the acting is stiff.

It posits an international feminist conspiracy to depose the ruling American patriarchy with a feminist matriarchy. To achieve and establish it, they kidnap and replace the U.S. President, discredit the Head of the Z.O.W.I.E. intelligence agency, and commandeer a nuclear-armed space platform, all directed from Fabulous Face, a women&apos;s spa in the Virgin Islands. Circumstances compel ex-secret agent Derek Flint to help his ex-boss, and so uncover the conspiracy. Actors James Coburn and Lee J. Cobb reprise their roles as &quot;Derek Flint&quot; and spy chief &quot;Lloyd C. Cramden&quot;, Flint&apos;s ex-boss.\n\nLike all parodies, it&apos;s not fair to compare it to the original genre and you have to expect it to be at least somewhat silly - especially in this film the plot of feminists trying to take over the world. The last reviewer who gave it a low score obviously totally missed t.he point it&apos;s a parody It&apos;s a fun movie that moves along at a fast &amp; Coburn is great in the James Bond spoof role. Enjoy the film &amp; don&apos;t take it too seriously &amp; you&apos;ll have a fun ride.",

Sometime later I read Heston&apos;s comments. It seems there was a change of people in the front office at the studio and they recut the movie and added some more battle scenes. According to Heston they had a great script and story.\n\nI have thought for years that I would like to see the movie as it was directed. After all Frank Schaffner was a great director, who later on did &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot; Patton&quot;. I think there would be a market for the original cut, if the cuttings are still around. They could in effect re-release it. Now THAT would be something. There is no end to the way the studios can make money again and again on the same movies, is there. He He Althought I often question thier intelligence. Remember when they tried to stop the VCR&apos;s and throw away a whole new source of revenue.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost every bad review comes from someone expecting another Transformers or superhero fight film instead of actual sci fi.\n\nThis is a remake of The World The Flesh and The Devil, a great early sci fi from the 50s. And like the original, it&apos;s low budget and more of a character study with disturbing implications about society now, pre apocalypse.\n\nIn the original, the white woman simply can&apos;t be with a Blackman. Even after the end of the world, it just isn&apos;t done, is completely forbidden. In this film, the divide and the taboos are as much based on class, education, and religion as on race.\n\nSo don&apos;t let bad reviews from those demanding explosions and gore, or better yet exploding gore, or they find it &quot;boring,&quot; deter you. If you want good script, dialog, intelligence, and a story heavy on Biblical symbolism, this is it. And I&apos;ll bet the whining reviewers were too dense to even catch the heavy Christian symbolism.",

Not content with tricking his murderer into killing his wife and stumbling to a watery death, the prologue&apos;s blind victim brings about the tortured demise of his own daughter so that she can haunt his murderer&apos;s innocent son. Then the blind victim returns in the flesh, as it were, to personally finish off the samurai who kills the son. Along the way, the ghost engineers jealousy, deceit, despair, attempted rape and mutilation to achieve his ends.\n\nThe Ghosts of Kasane includes several elements that would resurface 2 years later in the same director&apos;s The Ghost of Yotsuya, the two most notable being the similarity in the appearance of the two ghosts in each film, and the somewhat stylized presentation, adapted from Japan&apos;s kabuki theatre. This earlier work is not as accomplished as Yotsuya in its atmosphere, performances and visual effects, but still manages some scary moments. Amongst the most original is the way in which we&apos;re eventually shown Rui&apos;s disfigurement. There&apos;s also the director&apos;s preference already in evidence for mobile camerawork, elaborate sets and a powerful score.\n\nAlthough only in the second rank of Nobuo Nakagawa&apos;s films, The Ghosts of Kasane is a good introduction to his style and to the venerable tradition of Japanese ghost stories."

It doesn&apos;t take long for the characters to explore nothing and then learn to live in it &amp; enjoy it. Instead the characters could have spent a lot more time in the normal world exercising this new power slowly throughout the movie until maybe toward the end there is Nothing. This would have had a more satisfying storyline as the viewer could sort of feel like they&apos;re vicariously vanishing life&apos;s problems along with the character, only to learn the moral is that if you don&apos;t learn to live with your problems, you&apos;ll eventually wish away EVERYTHING....just an idea.",

      "reviewBody": "Li chiamarono... briganti! (They called them... brigands!) is a 1999 Italian film, directed by Pasquale Squitieri. It tells the story of Carmine Crocco, a 19th-century Italian brigand who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the brigandage during the Italian unification, by opposing the army of King Victor Emmanuel II. It stars Enrico Lo Verso, Claudia Cardinale, Franco Nero, Remo Girone, Giorgio Albertazzi among the others. The movie was quickly suspended from its cinema run and it is not available on VHS or DVD.\n\nMovie Plot: Carmine Crocco (Enrico Lo Verso) is an outlaw native of Rionero in Vulture (Basilicata), who was forced to the bandit&apos;s life after killing a man who had harassed his sister. He joined Giuseppe Garibaldi&apos;s Expedition of the Thousand against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies hoping for a pardon, because the Savoy&apos;s government promised to forgive deserters in exchange for military service. But the promise wasn&apos;t kept and Crocco was arrested. He also noted that the economic situation was getting worse, with new taxes and growing unemployment.\n\nHe is soon released with the help of the local clergy and, disappointed by the unfulfilled promise of the new government, Crocco is persuaded by the cleric Don Pietro (Remo Girone) to become the leader of the resistance against Victor Emmanuel II, promising him money and weapons. Thus Crocco joins the Bourbon side, forming an army composed mainly of poor people.\n\nThe brigand and his men conquer the Vulture region in the name of king Francis II, gaining the support of the local population. The new Italian government is worried about this rebellion and General Enrico Cialdini (Benoît Vallès) is assigned to suppress it. The repression is cruel; Cialdini orders the shooting of the brigands and anyone who deals with them, mass killings (where even women and children are not spared) and confiscation of basic necessities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bourbon government in exile sends the Spanish General José Borjes (Francesco Mazzini) to Basilicata, to reinforce and discipline the bands. Crocco does not trust Borjes from the start because he is worried about losing his leadership, but he accepts the alliance. After some victorious battles, Crocco breaks the alliance with Borjes because he does not want to serve under a foreigner.\n\nCrocco&apos;s lieutenant, Caruso (Ennio Coltorti), betrays him hoping for clemency, revealing to the authorities the hideouts of the brigands. After his betrayal, Crocco&apos;s army suffers many casualties and many of his men are captured and executed by firing squad. In the face of a losing battle, the only way to save himself is escape.\n\nOne Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen. I&apos;m Astounded Why Italy In The Name Of Democracy Would Ban A Truthful Great Movie Like Li chiamarono... briganti!.",

In summary, it had a total of 5 short stories all inter-weaved through a fragmented timeline, and a host of characters in those stories who have one way or another, played a part in the girl&apos;s life, during when she was alive, and after.\n\nThe Stranger stars Toni Collette as the woman who discovered the body, and how she gets thrust into the media limelight, yet yearning for that freedom to flee from her domineering mother. The Sister tells of a pathologist&apos;s inability to fight on and continue her family&apos;s believe that her missing sister is still out there somewhere, and not to throw in the towel and give up hope. The Wife will manage to rile you up, with the story of a neglected wife, and her hopes for reconciling with her estranged husband, who prefers gallivanting late at night to spending time with her, and of course, with her decision to protect her husband&apos;s secrets to losing him for sure altogether when revealed. And The Mother reminds you that a mother&apos;s love knows no bounds. Hurt by her daughter&apos;s disappearance, the worse case scenario happens, and Mum has got to heal old wounds. It&apos;s a touching short, and I thought one of the most powerful amongst the rest. And rounding it up, like the last pieces of a jigsaw, is The Dead Girl&apos;s story, where we see a foul mouthed Brittany Murphy bringing it all on.\n\nThe movie had excellent performances all round by the ensemble cast, and it doesn&apos;t have any big bang moments to shock and awe. It&apos;s a dramatic story, rather than a mystery- thriller-whodunnit. I was glad that it didn&apos;t go down the torture porn route, although it could have, but didn&apos;t need to. Leaving it where it is will already allow your imagination to run wild what the outcome will be. However, this might serve as a let down to some as it might seem that it failed to want to bridge the missing gap in the timeline. Fragmented timeline and multiple, parallel stories do seem to be the rage these days (Babel anyone?), but it all boils down to how much of a story you can make out of a single drop in the pond. That&apos;s what The Dead Girl feels like, with the stories the inevitable ripples that fan out.\n\nYou Are My Sunshine looks like a song very popularly used in end credits, and so far I had thought that it was a simple childhood nursery song. But when used in this context, it had a profound depth telling of longing and missing, that everyone has their own sunshine that they hold very dear to. Recommended movie, especially if you&apos;re into the fragmented timeline fad.",

The movie starts off with 2 children who need to cross the wilderness to claim their land inheritance meet a gambler on the run. Together they face natures obstacles in order to reach their destination. Granted, there were a few parts that were pretty predictable as to what was going to happen next.

Family as the only passageway toward improvement, forgiveness, and compassion. A series of vignettes styltistically designed towards passageways with the relationship between father and daughter, &amp; father and son. Just a lovely set of characters finding &amp; discovering something new as tragedy strikes, essentially a catalyst towards searching for something more, quite beautiful in all honesty. Women hating the men in their life, until they are there as the last resort towards companionship and compassion. Beautifully photographed by william lubtchansky, with a great view of multiple seasons, finally culminating in gorgeous shots during snowfall. Wonderfully acted by all involved, all of the daughters are terrific in this, and the relationship with the men in their lives is wonderfully interwoven as it shatters in our view. An incredibly captivating film that deals wonderfully with family, loss, relationships, and forgiveness."

What may have started out as a sick,twisted plot (because Manson&apos;s record deal with Terry Melcher went sour) became a nightmare-media-pumped circus that year. Its macabre scenario was coupled with the investigation of JFK - by Jim Garrison also. It signified the end of the 60&apos;s. The thought of chaotic ,violent, revolution replacing hopeful, non-violent social protest. This made the youth susceptible to any leader, and a lost,desperate and amoral person such as Manson began the litany; &quot;im simply a reflection of what you want to see&quot; &quot;I&apos;m just being used&quot; - This is a pretty good documentary. I&apos;ts disjointed narrative and unfocused colors make it seem as disruptive as the times. Today, days are empty, meaningless and lost. People are spiritually unfulfilled, but want simple entertainment and just want to work. The 60&apos;s represented change, but once the means of change were co-opted by the secret state - revolution came. People wanted to make a difference but the Manson followers were manipulated to live care free lives and destroy the lives of the privileged. This film is worth seeing!"

      "reviewBody": "Bachna Ae Haseeno is another modern Yash Raj fare. It is a romantic comedy at first and then turns into a... romantic drama. The film centres around the character of Raj, played by Ranbir Kapoor. Divided into three episodes each one presenting his relationships with three different women in his life, Bachna Ae Haseeno has a far stronger second half, but overall it&apos;s just another clichéd take on modern relationships. The movie shows the character of Raj as a guy who does not really take anything seriously but it aims to portray his growing maturity in life, and it partially succeeds. The first chapter presents a rather ordinary counter train meeting. It is a very cheesy episode which takes a lot from such films as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Jab We Met and actually does it admittedly. The second one is another meaningless portion portraying his relationship with an ambitious yet selfless aspiring model, and the third chapter shows how he ultimately falls in love with probably the wrong girl - an independent young lady who, among other jobs, works as a taxi driver and sees marriage as an obstacle. The first two episodes show Raj breaking the heart of two different girls, and the third shows how a girl breaks his heart. His heartbreak motivates him to try and meet his ex-girlfriends and ask for their forgiveness.\n\nAs one can see, Bachna Ae Haseeno has a very unoriginal script. Not that it copies a certain film, but it just takes inspiration from so many famous romantic comedies that it really gets on one&apos;s nerves from time to time and looks very ordinary throughout. It also has many annoying references to previous Yash Raj flicks. The second half takes more shape but it&apos;s not without its flaws either. Expectedly, it unfolds in episodes, mainly two, in which the protagonist tries to atone for his sins and clean his conscience. The first episode with that girl Mahi is handled pretty well, but come on, why would a girl lose her faith in love because she was lied to by a jerk whom she knew for one sole day? The fact she even remembers him after 12 long years looks totally awkward. The second episode re-meets him with Radhika, who was deeply in love with him and was abandoned by him on the wedding day. She is now known as Shreya Rathod, a popular supermodel whose attitude has become most cruel, malicious and evil, something which reminisces of Meryl Streep&apos;s Miranda in The Devil Wears Prada. This sequence is far more credible and it is perhaps the film&apos;s most entertaining. And then, after doing what he so longed for, he goes back to meet the girl who broke and heart. What happens next is something I believe anyone can predict.\n\nBachna Ae Haseeno is traditionally made, with songs, emotions and moments of old platitude, but then again, it has its pluses. The soundtrack by Vishal-Shekhar is very good. &quot;Khuda Jaane&quot; is the best number - well composed, performed and visualised on-screen. The casting is quite okay. The script does not really require some great acting talents to begin with, so it&apos;s passable. Ranbir Kapoor is plain okay as the main lead. He is generally well cast, but he does not register the growth in his character with total conviction. This kind of a role would have suited perfectly someone like Saif Ali Khan, whose superb comic timing is matched by his ability to mature as a person throughout a film. Ranbir is just not there yet, and although he is confident, that too is overdone at times. The girls are mainly there to look pretty, and they definitely do. Minissha Lamba is vivacious and cute, Deepika Padukone is extremely pretty, but both get overshadowed by Bipasha Basu who is so amazingly attractive that at times it&apos;s hard to believe anyone could leave her like Raj did. It looks like she gets sexier with every film, but besides that, her performance is probably the film&apos;s most convincing. Despite its flaws, Bachna Ae Haseeno is not that bad a film and it has its moments, which make for quite a decent one-time watch.",

This film is not about two gay men, as one character is gay, the other is straight. It is a movie about how two people who seem to be very different are really very similar. Both love their country and they learn that love of man (or of woman) and of country can be expressed differently and still be valued and respected. It is a wonderful, charming, endearing and thoroughly well acted movie. It is extremely realistic and gives and shows a snapshot of Cuba we are not able to see or partake of. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is funny, well acted and well written and directed. The two male leads are superior as is the female character. I have seen this movie many times and never tire of it. I most highly recommend it. It is not a gay film, so don&apos;t think of it that way or you will be very disappointed.",

To me it more or less ruined the enjoyment of the film"

      "reviewBody": "This little gem can be appreciated on two levels.  Non-jazz fans who have never heard of Red Nichols will find a fine little &quot;family movie,&quot; which despite its 192O&apos;s-speakeasy milieu offers up nothing seamier than the observation by Red&apos;s wife, Bobbi (Barbara Bel Geddes in a performance of remarkable warmth) that their daughter has come to believe that &quot;breakfast is a cup of coffee and an aspirin.&quot;  The story of the daughter&apos;s attack of polio and her fight to walk again is unflinching and the first-time viewer should pack sufficient Kleenex.  Fans of Danny Kaye will find plenty of examples of his trademark clowning, but they&apos;ll also find moments of wonderful dramatic and introspective acting.\n\nThe most remarkable scene in the movie:  a guilty Nichols/Kaye, feeling that his daughter&apos;s polio is the direct result of his neglect of her in favor of jazz, promises God that if she survives, he will give up music and devote himself to her care.  Sound hokey?  Could have been.  But the scene where Kaye throws his cornet into the river is absolutely spine-chilling.  He stops, tenderly caressing the cornet keys, allowing the happy memories to pass wistfully over his features...then coldly, abruptly, tosses the instrument into the waters below.  When Kaye straightens up, he seems to have aged twenty years and gained fifty pounds...a remarkable scene.\n\nThe second level on which the film can be appreciated:  an introduction to a wonderful musician.  Like &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; and &quot;The Benny Goodman Story,&quot; &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; makes little attempt to give an accurate portrayal of its subject.  Ernest Loring Nichols, from all accounts, was a cool, calculating businessman, nothing like the madcap, freewheeling character played by Danny Kaye.  As a cornetist he stood willingly in the shadow of his idol Bix Beiderbecke, whose playing style he strove (with some success) to duplicate.  Despite the fact that Bix was the major personal and professional influence on Red, he is mentioned only once, toward the end of the film:  &quot;(in those early days) there was Louis (Armstrong), Bix and me--and that was it!&quot;\n\nBiographical inaccuracies aside, the pure tone of the real Nichols&apos; cornet shines through brilliantly, and reaches out to grab the ear of the traditional jazz fan--at least it did mine.  When I first saw the film in &apos;81, I was a Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman fan, and knew Nichols only as a bandleader they had played with early on.  The movie was a springboard, leading me to search out the albums, and the real biographical details, of the very real Red Nichols.\n\nIncidentally, the film benefited the by-then largely forgotten Nichols greatly:  just as the late-5O&apos;s dixieland-revival was gathering steam, he landed a Columbia contract, and recorded some wonderful stereo albums of his past hits--and of the music specially written for the film by Silvia Fine (Mrs. Danny Kaye).  Though he died in &apos;65 (while in Vegas to play a gig), his music lives on through these wonderful albums --and through the soundtrack on Decca, featuring not only Nichols but Louis Armstrong.  Their duets, through placed in fictionalized scenes, stand as a legitimate audio document of two of the earliest and most influential cornetist/trumpeters in history playing together--in glorious, analog stereo.  I&apos;ll join the others who&apos;ve commented on this film in wishing that this wonderful soundtrack would be released on CD.  (Not outside the realm of possibility:  the soundtrack of &quot;Pete Kelly&apos;s Blues, from the same time period, has just appeared on CD...so who knows?)\n\nFor both traditional jazz fans, and those who appreciate wholesomely uplifting (but NOT goody-goody) film, this movie is a treasure.",

      "reviewBody": "Somewhere in Hollywood there are people who think children are morons and when they set up to make a kid movie, they do it starting with this premise. Morons they may be, but not in the sense their brains don&apos;t work well, but because they don&apos;t have enough experience. As such, this kind of films appear to me made for retarded (in the real sense of the word) people.\n\nAs a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth from 2008, it is not that bad. The only character remaining, though, is Josh Hutcherson&apos;s, so I was at first confused if this is the sequel to that film or to Race to Witch Mountain, which stared Dwayne Johnson and some kids. Also, all the characters are male but for a teen that has no real role in the film. So I was really missing Anita Briem.\n\nThe effects were not bad, rather average. The plot itself, taken from afar and with the grain of salt that one has to take with a movie made for children, had potential. I also liked how the characters completed one another, instead of the lone hero knowing and doing everything. However the script to this plot was so incredibly bad that I could not like it, no matter how much I tried.\n\nBottom line: a franchise dedicated to the sense of wonder and discovery in Jules Verne&apos;s books should make more of an effort for actual education. Dropping occasional (and conflicting) science facts that don&apos;t even apply to the situation is not enough. Also, having silly to the point of idiotic characters doesn&apos;t really inspire kids, either. I grew up with the books of Jules Verne. This entire series has nothing to do with them.",

(late teens) Towards the end, as I was choking back tears and grabbing at Kleenex&apos;s, I looked around as there was total silence from the audience. It was AWED SILENCE, people! Every woman was bawling her eyes out and the men, without exception, were scrunched down into their collars, staring intently, holding back tears. This is Deepa&apos;s finest hour. She can retire now knowing she has made a worthy film. I would have voted 10 but there were a few technical glitches such as one moment were the color/lighting changed for about 3 seconds in an important scene and then snapped back. No blame to Deepa, though. I have sent several to see the film and all have raved about it, Can hardly wait to buy the DVD and see it again. The criticisms were political and should not be considered. Any film that criticizes aspects of a religion gets blasted from fundamentalists. This film is NOT a political statement. It is entertainment based on a political statement. It should not be missed. Brava!!!",

He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman.\n\n&quot;Les Miserables&quot; is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it captures every viewer&apos;s hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. It is so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like a baby. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening and closing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just let my t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout. I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticket price, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I was dehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.\n\nIt&apos;s amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is. From the relentless struggle for existence, the the uplifting revolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrity of Jean. Everything keeps emotions high, and love i find my tears literally in a freefall mode without even knowing why. &quot;Les miserables&quot; is a wonderful masterpiece, and is certainly one of the best films I have ever watched."

This ultra-low budget flick has a clean-shaven Chuck playing a truck driver searching for his lost brother in a corrupt town run by an even more corrupt judge. While this isn&apos;t one of Chuck&apos;s best films, it is worth a watch for diehard Norris fans. I have to admit I love watching Chuck beat up bad guys and this movie delivers the goods. While the movie does drag at certain points, the fight sequences make up for the slow pacing. It&apos;s also quite obvious that this movie was made to capitalize on the CB craze of the 70&apos;s."

      "reviewBody": "Le mura di Malapaga (1949) is a Italian/French movie directed by René Clément. It stars Jean Gabin as Pierre Arrignon, a French criminal who escapes to Genoa, Italy. \n\nRené Clément was a famous French director in the mid-20th century. He is sometimes called the father of French New Wave Cinema, although the directors in the New Wave were younger than Clément. \n\nJean Gabin was the leading French male actor of his day. Clément and Gabin made a great team, and what resulted was a great movie. As others have pointed out, this film is a mixture of film noir and neorealism. We see film noir touches everywhere--shadows, steel bars, crimes. Neorealism was easy if you were shooting in 1949 Genoa. The rubble left behind by WW II was everywhere. People speak of &quot;living in the rubble&quot; or &quot;playing in the rubble&quot; is if this is just part of everyday life. (I assume it was part of everyday life.)\n\nThe movie also stars Isa Miranda as Marta, the Italian woman who falls in love with Pierre. She&apos;s easy to distinguish--the beautiful, slender woman with high cheekbones. (That&apos;s a joke, because it describes every French movie star of her day. However, she really was beautiful, and she really was a great actor.) \n\nHowever, for me, acting honors go to Vera Talchi, as Cecchina, Marta&apos;s daughter. At age 15, it couldn&apos;t have been easy to play alongside Gabin and Miranda, but she managed it extremely well.\n\nThis film won the Oscar as Best Foreign Language Film in 1950. We saw it in 35mm at Rochester&apos;s wonderful Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum. However, it will work almost as well on the small screen. If you love film noir and 1940&apos;s neorealism, it&apos;s a must see. Even if those are not your favorite type of films, it&apos;s still worth seeking out and seeing.\n\nP.S. The Walls of Malapaga in Genoa still exist. It was hard to get information about them, because my search brought up either the movie or a restaurant in Genoa. However, I finally tracked down the fact that Malapaga was a terrible debtor&apos;s prison for centuries. It&apos;s these walls that physically keep Pierre from getting away. Of course, there are emotional walls as well.",

As soon as the plot point is revealed, the movie jolts to a new scene.\n\nThe acting was all over the place, ranging from deadpan, to completely out of character, or not appropriate for the situation. \n\nOne glaring example is the boyfriend character, who seems completely disinterested in his girlfriend ( main character ), though his dialog suggests he is suppose to be very concerned, and &quot;dropped everything&quot; to try to find her. \n\nThe story line it&apos;s self is pretty good, though due to poor directing and / or script, parts of it can be slow. There was some actual suspense built up toward the end, though most of the movie really didn&apos;t get me too &quot;invested&quot;. \n\nAs far as the main antagonist, the Grim Reaper, when they reveal him at the end, he looks ridiculous! It looks like some one with a cheap rubber mask, and rubber foam glued to their costume. \n\nIf they didn&apos;t have the budget for a half way decent costume, they should have left the Reaper in his robes. The undead from &quot;Evil Dead 3&quot; are a lot better looking.\n\nThe sound effects the Reaper made got on my nerves also. No matter what surface he was walking on, it would make the generic &quot;walking on metal grating&quot; noises you hear in quite a few older video games. \n\nOn a final note, the mausoleum were the opining credits and the scenes near the end were shot at, look exactly like the one from &quot;Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula&apos;s Guest&quot; .",

Conceived perhaps as a female version of Van Damme&apos;s &quot;Kickboxer&quot;, &quot;Pushed to the Limit&quot; fails to deliver. The dramatic parts are insufferably slow and stilted, and although Mimi is a talented fighter, particularly when she applies wrestling / grappling moves, her talents are often obscured by the editing or by the simple fact that the camera focuses on other things instead of the fighting. For a movie centered around a fighting tournament, there is a surprising lack of long, continuous fight scenes here. If you feel like you need to see every Mimi Lesseos film then go ahead, but if you just want to see one, try &quot;Beyond Fear&quot; instead. (*1/2)",

This was one of the best martial arts/action films I have ever seen and I never get tired watching it. The plot is pretty basic but this is solely a showcase for Brandon Lees martial arts. The fight in the hotel and the restaurant are some of the most entertaining I have seen. I think that it works that he doesn&apos;t come across as invincible but you know he is going to prevail. The fight scenes are frenetic but realistic and pack a real punch. Also the film had quite a few funny moments. Particularly from the mob boss played by Nick Mancuso - but also Lee as well that keep the film entertaining inbetween the action. There is also a bit of heart as well with Lees character mourning his dad. I always wondered whether he was chanelling the loss of his own father, particularly in the scene at the female detectives house. Overall this was an excellent action film that show Brandon Lee was a real talent and it&apos;s a tragedy he died so young. I think if he would have gone on he would have been a real superstar."

After the heady romanticism and visual artistry of Julie Taymor&apos;s `Frida,&apos; I was hardly prepared to see another arresting, Mexican melodrama, Patricia Cardoso&apos;s `Real Women Have Curves.&apos;  Every woman who thinks about her weight should see this movie-it will make you a convert to the humane notion that all bodies are beautiful.  And it will reveal a deeply humane culture at the same time. \n\nNaturally beautiful and full-bodied actress America Ferrera plays Ana, a Mexican American whose graduation and scholarship to Columbia University threaten the family&apos;s unity and the control by her mother, who tells stories of runaway girls with disastrous ends and the admonition, `That&apos;s what happens to girls who don&apos;t listen to their mothers.&apos;\n\nLike teenagers in any culture, Ana is trying to break away from a domineering culture and mother while she also achieves a balanced acceptance of her zaftig body.  The scene where she and the other seamstresses in her sister&apos;s sweat shop remove their outer clothes to escape the heat and eventually admire their bulging, stretch-marked bodies is about as loving and lyrical as any other I have seen where Hollywood&apos;s obsession with world-class beauty is obliterated by the sheer attractiveness of women celebrating the imperfections of their bodies.\n\nEqually so, when Ana loses her virginity, she tells her lover,\n\n&quot;Turn the lights on.  I want you to see me.  See, this is what I look like.&quot; He responds, &quot;You&apos;re not fat.  You&apos;re beautiful.&apos;  It&apos;s easy to see why this film won awards at Cannes for audience appreciation and ensemble acting.  It is a hymn to a culture that values family and a girl who values herself."

Poignant, gripping, painful, so realistic and close to reality of millions of couples all over the world. A tale about old age, not very old though, but more than mature anyway. Terrific performances pulled by two giants of the French movie industry: Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret. Many folks may feel empathy for both of the characters, feel so close to them, to their tragedy. A movie about loneliness and the loss of love but maybe not tenderness. A film about regret of lost happiness. Two people who spent their whole life together and who suddenly get bitter, only thru a cat issue. You could spend hours analysing this awesome story, but so gloomy, sad, moving. One of Pierre Granier Deferre&apos;s best, with LE TRAIN and LA VEUVE COUDERC. In terms of couple feud about a pet - among many oter things - it&apos;s the smoother version of WAR OF THE ROSES.",

      "reviewBody": "Balalaika is not the worst of Nelson Eddy&apos;s films, that&apos;s I Married an Angel and even that for this viewer was not that bad. But it&apos;s not even close to the likes of Maytime, New Moon and The Chocolate Soldier. Balalaika is a decent and quite nice film but did come across as very problematic. Eddy has never been the best of actors(his best performances have been in Chocolate Soldier, Maytime and Let Freedom Ring), and Balalaika doesn&apos;t really change that perception. He is at least better than he was in The Phantom of the Opera and I Married An Angel and at least he is more convincing as a Russian than he was as an Austrian in Bittersweet. But he is very stiff and wooden here, he has charming moments but he never looks comfortable. The story is also very predictable, cumbersome and even silly(at times), and the pacing can be rather dull. The script fares little better, often awkward sounding and lifeless- the film was strongly censored at the risk of offending so that could be why- while the humour is mild and unfortunately not very funny. Charles Ruggles fares the best in the supporting cast, but excepting the last fifteen minutes where he&apos;s affecting Frank Morgan&apos;s comic talents are not really put to good use and his performance is somewhat indifferent. The costumes and sets are beautiful, and the crisp black and white photography is especially striking in the Ride Cossack Ride and Stille Nacht (Silent Night) sequences, ones that is stirring for the former and poignant for the latter. The score and songs are a treat to listen to, At the Balalika, Ride Cossack Ride, Song of the Volga Boatmen and Toreador Song are particularly great. Frank Morgan&apos;s song in the last fifteen minutes is also very moving, as is the ending itself. Even if his acting is not up to snuff, Eddy still produces some magnificent singing in Balalaika(the best thing about the film), always robust and beautiful and at its best in Ride Cossack Ride and Song of the Volga Boatmen. And extra credit for singing in four languages in one film, you don&apos;t hear that very often. Ilona Massey looks absolutely stunning- even that doesn&apos;t do justice to her beauty actually- and a worthy leading lady for Eddy. They work well together and blend nicely(if not quite as much as Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald). In conclusion, a nice decent film but a long way from one of Nelson Eddy&apos;s finest hours. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "One thing you could always say about Angelopoulos movies is that Greek melancholic reverence could be felt with a naked eye in almost every single one of his pictures. Dust of Time is so detached from its subject that it is an absolute shame that this is his last picture. Especially considering that half of it, or maybe even more, is in English. Dafoe tries, but there is nothing for him to act as he solemnly glances around with awkward delivery, seemingly never changing his coat throughout the entire movie.\n\nSplitting the timeline in many periods where Angelopoulos is seemingly preoccupied with doing summersaults to show totalitarianism in such an exaggerated farcical manner that you can&apos;t even take any of it seriously in good faith. Especially that bizarre allusion in the sci-fi x-ray search scene. One too many unpleasant airport frisks?\n\nThe present is preoccupied with an awkward love triangle where truly ancient actors play against 40-year-old Irene Jacob, who is so uncomfortable and unconvincingly aged up that it&apos;s hard to believe someone so dedicated as Theo would go for it. I guess he really liked the actress.\n\nAs a sequel to Weeping Meadow, it&apos;s just aimless. Almost nothing is brought up or expanded on. And the ending, despite its undeniable beauty, still comes off as desperate. It is never a good sign when several characters die seemingly of sadness for the sake of a very plain metaphor about past becoming negligible.",

      "name": "An unexpectedly rich, fascinating crime flick",
      "reviewBody": "As filmmaker Fukasaku Kinji was coming fresh off the success of the &apos;Battles without honor or humanity&apos; series of the previous few years, it&apos;s easy to see the kinship this shares with those works. It&apos;s practically a sister film with its chaotic violence, handheld cameras, and considerable use of identifying text and narration, and of course the major focus on yakuza. I dare say &apos;Graveyard of honor&apos; is even more upfront about the nastiness of the subject matter, though, as foremost figure Ishikawa Rikio is depicted as an especially vicious brute. Even amidst the turmoil of the post-war years in Japan this seems particularly ugly with its misogyny, sexual assault, xenophobia, and significant violence, and Ishikawa&apos;s ambitions are fraught with hot-headed impulsiveness. Yet Fukasaku had a very definite sense of style, and in working alongside screenwriter Kamoi Tatsuhiko he fashioned a compelling, undeniably flavorful story of gangland activity and the journey of one specific yakuza. I don&apos;t know if &quot;enjoyable&quot; is quite the right word, but it&apos;s an engrossing and satisfying viewing experience.\n\nOne doesn&apos;t need to read of the production history to understand the demands Fukasaku placed on his cast and crew with his direction, and the result is an overarching sense of severe aggressiveness. It&apos;s seen not just in the hard-boiled, physically intensive acting, or the stunts, effects, and choreography, but even in Nakazawa Hanjiro&apos;s dynamic, vivacious, and often somewhat free-wheeling cinematography. Where a softer tone is occasionally employed the proceedings feel like more of a measured crime drama (e.g. &apos;The godfather,&apos; for an obvious frame of reference), but this is not the dominant vibe as the violence of the seedy underworld endures, if not expands around intemperate Ishikawa. All along the way the picture unquestionably benefits from the grainy production values of the mid-70s, and the production design and art direction are rich and vibrant even as they commonly portend both the relative refinement to which yakuza aspire, and the grit and filth of the streets. Say what one will otherwise, the costume design, hair, and makeup are also consistently sharp.\n\nEven as it treads a familiar, inevitable path, Ishikawa&apos;s trajectory is low-key fascinating, and every beat, scene, surrounding character, and piece of dialogue is built to accentuate the stark vitality of the tawdry saga. Among the actors, star Watari Tetsuya and Takigawa Yumi notably stand out with their ranged performances as troubled Ishikawa and beleaguered Chieko. I&apos;m also a big fan of Tsushima Toshiaki&apos;s original music, a score of themes that are alternately pensive and heavily dramatic as handily befits the progression of the protagonist&apos;s life and criminal career, from fierce and bold to dour and tragic. All told I wonder if this feature doesn&apos;t actually count among Fukasaku&apos;s best, and certainly ranking highly in the very least, including in comparison to the noted franchise of the prior few years. The man&apos;s oeuvre covered a wide spectrum, and while not all his works are equal, at his best he absolutely carved out some fabulously absorbing classics that walk a line between bewitching narrative fiction, sheer exploitation, and cinematic artistry. I&apos;m incredibly pleased with how good &apos;Graveyard of honor&apos; is, and in all honesty it quite exceeded my expectations.\n\nFrom Ishikawa&apos;s early aspirations and the accompanying wanton bloodshed, to his sullen decline and downfall, the mood herein varies more than I anticipated, and the finished product is all the better for the fact of it. By the nature of the material it won&apos;t appeal to all comers, yet those who are receptive to the genre will surely find much to love herein, and the filmmaker can almost always be relied upon for a quality movie. I&apos;d stop short of saying this wholly demands viewership, but through every turn &apos;Graveyard of honor&apos; is terrific and rather captivating, and I&apos;m glad to give it my high recommendation.",

      "reviewBody": "The film follows Warcraft III players Grubby-4K from Holland and SKY from China as they prepare for and play in the 2007 WGC championship. A tiny bit is about retired player Madfrog. The documentary, however, does not linger on the personal lives of the players so much and almost not at all on the game of Warcraft; instead it tries to convey the feel of the lives of the people involved. I think that is a refreshing, albeit impractical, perspective in a movie: you get to feel inside their world, without having to actually know any of it. In that sense, this is a movie made for non gamer audiences.\n\nThree main highlights of the documentary felt worth discussing. The first was the comparison between the two players. Li Xiaofeng (SKY) is a country boy, with peasant parents beating him with sticks for playing instead of trying to be a doctor and then laughingly admit it on tape. That glimpse into rural China is the second thing that caught my eye. SKY admits in the very beginning that he doesn&apos;t think he is very smart, but he works a lot on practicing 12 hours a day. Grubby is a Dutch player who values creativity and his parents are irrelevant to his career choice. Much more important is his Singaporean model and fellow gamer girlfriend. So it&apos;s like a battle between genius and persistence.\n\nThe third point is the actual championship, where two young guys that live for the game they play are isolated in booths playing on the computer, while an entire building filled with light and reporters and cameras and people and commentators and so on and so on is built around them, like a giant leech. The ending, displaying the results of the next year&apos;s WGC and the fact that Madfrog is working as a guard in a prison, drives this point even further. These are sportsmen, just like any others, their blood sucked by the industry, then discarded when they are not fit enough to be superstars.\n\nBottom line: nice insight in the lives of professional computer game players, a recommendation for gamers, non gamers and parents alike. Not perfect, but a good documentary regardless."

Then maybe this fits into a larger theme of industrialization. Still, there are several ways of interpreting each scene and at times I had the feeling that they try to show - or to produce a metaphor for - human emotions, such as cheating, sorrow, the will not to die alone. &quot;And we can rust the whole world and scatter it into the dust of universe&quot; You will certainly make what you want of this movie. You may understand that technology is evil, that industrialization takes our souls away, or that even in our worst moments we crave for closeness and we don&apos;t want to be alone. This is a special movie - so beware - it is not accessible to most people. There&apos;s a chance that you won&apos;t be able to think for yourself and that you&apos;ll expect some quick &amp; nice Hollywood conclusions which you&apos;re not going to get - in which case, this movie will be a waste of your time.",

Lee Majors gets sick of the government who wishes to restrain everyone&apos;s need for speed.  So he and a teen skip town and go cross country as a team that&apos;s like the Dukes of Hazard meets Batman and Robin (not the lame film, just the hero team). Things get nutty when Burgess Meredith is called in to take them down but he decides he won&apos;t and just pretend to.  It&apos;s fun but all in all a cheese flick.  Last words of the film: &quot;this could set us back to the 1980&apos;s.&quot; That&apos;s is kinda scary when you think about it but John Hughes films would improve."

He has a fling with Angel McGinnis (Susannah York) and she informs her Scotland Yard father who needs the known gambler to smoke out notorious criminal Harry Dominion.\n\nWarren Beatty is Warren Beatty. He is a movie star. This is a British crime thriller but it has few thrills. The plot meanders around. If the premise of the movie is recruiting a card cheat to take down a criminal, that&apos;s what this movie should start with. Instead, it spends so much time doing the marked cards and the rest. This should start with Beatty in prison after getting caught cheating on cards. The recruitment comes immediately and the plot can begin right away. The first time Barney meets up with Harry should not take over an hour. If it&apos;s about the marked cards, it should cut out the Dominion part. Even the knowing humor achieves very little. The general sense is that there is nothing here to see except one poker hand and one movie star.",

Taking the identity of a recently expired prince he shacks up with a group of upper crust at an Italian Villa amusing and edifying himself while mystifying and fascinating others. The prince quickly charms the ladies while intimidating them at the same time. One, Grazia ( wonderfully performed by Evelyn Venable) falls completely under his unintentional spell however and contemplates seeing her existence through with him.\n\nMarch flirts with going full Bela Lugosi in moments but charms and tones down enough to pose some interesting viewpoints and inquiries on this thing called life. Retaining his suave cold demeanor throughout he linchpins both the terror and humor of the film while director Mitchell Leisen tarts matters up with his usual lavish set design. And who could fault death for hanging with the conspicuous consumption crowd as opposed to the skid row consumptive crowd? A disturbingly entertaining film.",

The first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers.\n\nWell, I usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5, going from there:\n\nProduction: -1 for very obvious audio out of sync, +1 for nicely done special effects, the darkling actually gave me chills, +0.5 for nice colorization (I like the dull blue), -0.5 for the stupid sound track, +0.5 for the opening sequence -- I&apos;m a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title design.\n\nStory / Script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ/Matrix/Street Fighter ripoff/pastiche, -1 for not explaining some plot threads very well (spiders, darkling), -1 for boring, predictable ending, -1 for gratuitous exposition, both as words on the screen and as bland monologuing\n\nActing / Characterization: -0.5 for bad bad acting, although it gets a little better as the film progresses, -1 for lack of character development, especially among all the females\n\nOther: +1 for gratuitous male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for no sex scenes, which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot, +1 for hitting its target audience, teenage sci-fi/horror/thriller fans, even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genres.\n\nConclusion: This is not a &quot;film,&quot; this is a MOVIE. There&apos;s really nothing to analyze, it&apos;s just good, (relatively) clean fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of boys fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and/or mindlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, exquisitely-produced film masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won&apos;t like this film.\n\nUsing my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Cine noir in the purest style with nothing innovative in either the story or how it is played out on the screen. Apart from being filmed in Madrid and mostly at night, there is no way of differentiating this film from any other product made in the USA. The story is as unoriginal as a stale pizza. During a late night radio programme with telephone call-ins, a sinister type announces he is about to kill a girl. Through more telephone calls leaving `clues&apos; as to what he is going to do next, the film slithers murkily to its predictable end. It has no clout. It is rather like so many other regurgitated cinema or made for TV productions of this ilk.\n\n Lydia Bosch hammers out her dialogues in flat toneless onslaughts and sounds as false as a $33 bill; Beatrice Dalle is somewhat better as she struggles with her tones of urgency so as to lend some kind of character and personality to the proceedings; Juanjo Puigcorbé seems so stereotyped as to not be real, and the appearance of Bud Spencer did nothing to enhance any of the other three main actors, mostly because none of them were cast for this film but miscast for this film. However, if you are a glutton for these kinds of thrillers, you will bear with it and not get very excited about anything; even the music will leave you wondering what it was trying to do.\n\nNo, if you want to see a really good Spanish thriller I suggest you try `99.9&apos; (qv) which is far superior in all aspects.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s ironic that this is probably the least well-known of the Tracy/Hepburn collaborations--and yet, it&apos;s among their best as far as performances and overall content is concerned. Everyone, including KATHARINE HEPBURN and SPENCER TRACY, looks good in this film. VAN JOHNSON has one of his most engaging roles as the good guy who sees through the manipulations of corrupt ANGELA LANSBURY and ADOLPHE MENJOU.\n\nAnd so, dirty politics is the theme of this film taken from the stage play by Howard Lindsey and Russel Crouse that starred RALPH BELLAMY and RUTH HUSSEY. Unfortunately, as directed by Frank Capra, it has a certain staginess about the proceedings with actors making entrances and exits as if on cue in rather static situations. But it&apos;s a pretty polished script and it&apos;s amusing to see the wonderful ANGELA LANSBURY (all of 23) playing a sophisticated woman in her 40s with such ease and perfection.\n\nSpencer has a role tailor-made for his abilities, a man whose integrity is so challenged that he refuses to play by the rules of the game and play party politics. Hepburn, as the wife aware of his affair with Lansbury, is forthright and honest in her performance and, thankfully, less mannered than usual.\n\nStill timely in the way it talks about Republicans and Democrats, it&apos;s worth seeing for the marvelous cast and what they manage to do with the stage material. The title, of course, refers to politics as well as the marital union of Tracy and Hepburn.",

      "reviewBody": "Having just watched Ted Mikels&apos; film &quot;Apartheid Slave-Women&apos;s Justice&quot;, I was amazingly lenient when it came to viewing &quot;Seven Mummies&quot;. That&apos;s because &quot;Apartheid&quot; and many of Mikels&apos; other films are NOT on the IMDb Bottom 100 list--and should be. So, by comparison, &quot;Seven Mummies&quot; doesn&apos;t look THAT bad--but it still is bad.\n\nThe plot is the weird sort of concept that works best as a video game--sort of like &quot;Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare&quot;. Seriously--which is the zombie western sequel to &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;. It has plenty of shooting and violence and bloody gore, but as a film, it lacks plot and dialog--minor things that tend to make a movie worth watching! This movie begins in the present day with a group of prisoners escaping and heading into the desert. They wander into a strange western town--circa 1870. Now this SHOULD have been their first clue that this was NOT a town where they should stay. But, there are lots of hookers--and these sleazy men have been locked up for some time. So, they stick around for some fun--and in the middle of this, the townspeople become zombies of sorts--and the zombie prostitutes start tearing several of the prisoners apart. However, the townsfolk seem relatively easy to kill--and you don&apos;t even need a head shot! But, there are so many, they still don&apos;t seem to stand a chance. And, after a while, it all becomes more and more boring--as there is NO PLOT--just zombie/vampire/mummy folks trying to kill our anti-heroes. I say zombie/vampire/mummy because they eat flesh (so they must be zombies), they call each other vampires (ditto) and the film has mummy in the title (ditto). Whatever...all I know is that the film was, as I said, like watching a video game. Not much plot, terrible acting and dialog--I can see how it made the Bottom 100 list, but frankly it&apos;s not among the 100 worst films I&apos;ve seen. Isn&apos;t it sad that there are MANY films worse than this?!",

      "reviewBody": "Closure (2007) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nAlice (Gillian Anderson) is a successful business woman who has to attend a dinner for her work. She asks Adam (Danny Dyer) to take her to this party even though they&apos;ve only known each other for a few minutes. The two attend the party and then on the way home they are attacked by three men. Adam is severely beaten and Alice is raped. The two of them suffer the mental strain of what happened and soon Alice thinks it would be best to get revenge on the attackers.\n\nCLOSURE was originally titled STRAIGHTHEADS when it was released in Britain but when it came to America it was given a new title and went straight-to-DVD, which is understandable because there&apos;s really nothing here that demands for it to have been shown in a theater. The quality of the picture is also lacking and with the rather graphic story it&apos;s doubtful too many people would have lined up on a Friday night to check this thing out. Part of me wanted to enjoy this movie more than I actually did but there&apos;s just no way to get around the fact that there were all sorts of problems here.\n\nAs you can tell, this is yet another rape/revenge tale and there have been countless ones made over the past few decades. You&apos;ve got trash like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE as well as masterpieces like DEATH WISH. This film here doesn&apos;t really know if it wants to be a serious look at rape and its aftermath or if it just wants to be some sort of graphic revenge tale ala the remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. The film doesn&apos;t know what it wants to do so the viewer is pretty much just sitting there waiting for something to unfold and there were just too many logical issues that I had with the picture.\n\nFor starters, not for a second did I buy the relationship between Alice and Adam. The problem I had is that after the rape we pretty much jump a month ahead and the two are emotionally distraught from the ordeal. That is fine but the screenplay makes Adam a real mess of a character. Crying. Can&apos;t perform sexually. He really becomes a broken nut case. I understand he got beaten but at the same time I have a hard time believing he would be so connected to Alice, a woman he knew for a matter of hours before the attack. I&apos;ve read reviews where people called Adam a baby and a whiner but I don&apos;t mind seeing a &quot;weak&quot; guy on screen but the problem is the screenplay just doesn&apos;t do the character or the situation any favors.\n\nThere&apos;s a twist that happens and some graphic violence that finally comes up. Both of these are handles quite well but at the same time it pretty much goes against what came before it. The film clocks in at a very brief 80-minutes, which is very short for a film from this period. There are some good moments here including the performances by the two leads. This is especially true for Anderson who was very believable in the role of the rape victim and I really loved the little touches she brought to the scenes right after the rape as well as her mental state throughout the entire film.\n\nCLOSURE is an okay film but the flaws keep it from being anything better. As it stands, fans of the rape/revenge genre might want to check it out but others should probably start somewhere else."

It actually managed to catch my interest, especially the whole puzzle aspect of it. The integrated mythology was the best part of it. It could have been a great movie if they concentrated more on the different elements of the map - such as why each was included. It starts off slow but picks up in the 2nd half. Vivek Oberoi tends to get a little annoying. Jackie Shroff was perhaps the only actor in the whole thing that was sufficient. Sameera Reddy&apos;s role is completely unnecessary. Effects aren&apos;t bad, and landscape shots are well done. All in all, its good if you have time to spare.",

He recalls a time 30 years ago as a kid when Charles Wentworth brought his family for an unusual Christmas visit. On a snowy road after delivering gifts to the hospital, Charles killed a woman and child in an accident. He became despondent, and his wife leaves him taking their daughter. He would work at the hospital until he&apos;s gone. Terry constantly clashed with his father and struck out on his own. He returns home from California after 20 years when his father dies. He meets Charles&apos; brother Warren (Gordon Pinsent). He reconnects with Charles&apos;s daughter Katherine Wentworth (Joely Richardson) after 30 years who arrives with her adopted blind daughter but she doesn&apos;t remember her time in Rosepoint.\n\nThe movie takes a bit too long to get to Joely Richardson and even longer to get her together with Gary Sinese. It has a slow sad tone. This is more of a relationship movie between Terry and his dead father as well as Katherine and her father. It&apos;s also a very haunting movie. If the movie has more Joely Richardson, this would be more of a tear jerker. This is a sweet melodrama performed well by excellent actors.",

However, trouble brews when the rival is killed in a fiery crash during a grudge race and his wealthy father (Stephen McNally) exacts revenge against the group, with reluctant help from the local sheriff and his drunken deputy.

It doesn&apos;t look as cheap, for one thing, because it&apos;s mostly shot on location instead of shabby sets. Some of the locations are interesting, showing the real run down side of Los Angeles. And actor Steven Williams does well as the chief detective on the case. Still, it&apos;s not a movie you should actively seek out. There&apos;s a lot less martial arts in the movie than you&apos;d think, with a long middle portion where there are ZERO martial arts on display. And the martial arts fighting is pretty disappointing, with rapid cuts and unspectacular choreography. However, female viewers (and a few male viewers) will no doubt enjoy the multiple times that Don Wilson takes off his shirt. I&apos;ll see you again when I review &quot;Bloodfist 8&quot;!"

      "name": "Errol Flynn a progressive",
      "reviewBody": "I recently read Charles Higham&apos;s notoriously unreliable biography of Errol Flynn because I picked it up for about $1 at a secondhand bookshop. I had long refused to read it because of Higham&apos;s infamous claims that Flynn was a Nazi and because the dust cover displayed a swastika. The copy I picked up didn&apos;t have a dust cover. Higham&apos;s spurious claims are based on his knowledge of the mysterious Nazi character Erben, a one-time associate of Flynn&apos;s, who later recanted his Nazi views. Higham also refers to Flynn&apos;s affairs with Nazi women. I&apos;m not sure politics had much influence on Flynn&apos;s sex life. Nevertheless, it struck me while reading this drivel that you could just as easily construct a convincing portrait of Flynn as a communist. He secretly joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain and, of course, he made two pro-Castro films about Cuba. &quot;Cuban Rebel Girls&quot; is a bad film whichever way you look at it with an unusually poor performance from Errol (who was simply brilliant only recently in &quot;The Roots of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;). I have watched &quot;Cuban Rebel Girls&quot; several times because I nevertheless find it a fascinating and curious film. Director Mahon directed some right-wing Cold War films so I am not sure why he was involved with this one. In any case, the direction like the script, was poor. The script should have been handed over to producers like Samuel Z. Arkoff or Albert Zugsmith for better results. It&apos;s the sort of film Mamie Van Doren would have spiced up wonderfully. &quot;The Cuba Story&quot; is another mess of a film, but like &quot;Cuban Rebel Girls&quot; at least its heart is in the right place. Sad to see Errol Flynn in failing health in both these films. He looks old and weary after a lifetime of living it up. But the point to be made is that no Nazi would be associated with these pro-Castro films. Or if Flynn did have Nazi sympathies or allegiances at some stage(and like Erben, recanted), then it is instructive that he chose to be involved with these Cuba films. And as for those Nazi women Flynn was supposed to have slept with? Maybe he was just pumping them for information."

      "reviewBody": "Bhoot is one of the Ram Gopal Vermas milestone, and also the only good movie which is of genre horror and also a professional Bollywood film. Before Bhoot, the horror movies made in Bollywood were mostly will fit in comedy. Off course, other than Ramse movies, some serious tries were made like Ankahee and others. But they failed to get attention of the audience or to get good reviews and critics. Even Ramu&apos;s previous movies Raat and &apos;Darna Mana Hain&apos; failed to get any attention. \n\nSo before watching Bhoot I have prepared for a movie which will scare you less and make you sleep more. But I was totally wrong. The movie doesn&apos;t have ghosts with painted faces, neither it has females wearing bare minimum clothes and throwing other people around like basketball, neither it has Mantriks with skull in their hands. It is a very simple low budget movie. \n\nIt is more comparable to Kaun than any other Bollywood horror movies you have seen. Most of the credit goes to the Director, and remaining to the actors, specially Urmila. Urmila is the main character and mostly the story revolves around her, and she fits there so well. Ajay and Nana were as usual at their best leaving us with nothing to curse for. Ajay a simple, middle class husband who is totally helpless and got no clue of what should be done, while Nana a &apos;Chakram&apos; police inspector who has doubt that something weird is going on. These two characters too are plotted very well, and done with the same power by the actors. \n\nAnother good aspect is its short length. The movie starts quickly, without showing us any love story and song. A couple getting into a new apartment house, which is haunted, and the wife gets possessed by the ghost. Its just one line story. \n\nThe most important aspects of ghost stories is the environment making, and thats the most positive part of this movie. Just the sound of lift coming up and down makes so much of impact. I will recommend this movie to everyone, who enjoys Bollywood movies, and also to those who enjoys horror movies. In my opinion, this movies should go in &quot;101 must watch Bollywood movies&quot; as it is the only good horror movie made in Bollywood till date.",

      "reviewBody": "The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is kind of like a cross between The Virgin Suicides and Stand By Me. Set in the 70&apos;s (featuring many cool 70&apos;s haircuts) in small town Georgia, the story focuses on Francis, a 14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker. He and his pals, Tim, Wade, and Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) at the Puritan Christian high school they&apos;re unfortunate enough to attend. \n\nOne of their methods of escape is the &apos;The Atomic Trinity&apos; comic book. Each of them have their own character with superpowers (such as The Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy), battling against the tyrannical regime of Nunzilla/Pegleg (a gross caricature of Sister Assumpta). These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally removed from the reality of Francis, Tim, Wade and Joey.\n\nThe boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After stealing the school&apos;s nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta&apos;s office. A mad plan yes, but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.\n\nSome scenes of the film are very emotional, so if you have soft spot you&apos;ll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.\n\nFrancis&apos; relationship with Margie (the very cute Jenna Malone) also takes many curious and unique turns. The scene with the ghost watching them sleep was pleasingly weird. \n\nTaken from the one and only book (posthumously) by Chris Fuhrman (a book I must get as soon as I see), The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is attractively shot, wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting.\n\nThe DVD is in 1.85:1 widescreen (strangely non-anamorphic, though the region 2 version is) with Dolby 5.1 sound and a mild bunch of extras.",

Also, in a small part, Alexander D&apos;Arcy (he of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; fame).\n\nSome of the strongest scenes are in the early parts of the movie, especially when Kay Francis almost arrogantly descends the staircase at a grand reception she is giving, and, seemingly ignoring everybody, manages to turn every head in the place with the new creation she is wearing! Marvellous!! To the best of my knowledge this movie has never been shown on British TV.\n\nSo, over here at least, a forgotten film worth investigating.",

I&apos;m sorry, I might just be a teenager but I know crap when it&apos;s crap and I know what I like, and this movie I did not. Where was the plot? Where was one spec of originality? And where were the actors?\n\nSelma Blair was the best of the bunch. I don&apos;t care how good looking Freddie is, he needs to take some acting classes, either that strive to make his characters have a little bit more difference then the name change. I like Julia Stiles, but normally when you have to play off a bad actor it reflects badly on you. I didn&apos;t see the chemistry this couple was supposed to have.\n\nYes &quot;Down to You&quot; has it&apos;s cute moments, some funny moment, and few sweet moment, but worth 7 bucks? Not a snowball&apos;s chance in hell. Save your money and your time. Wait for video, or just don&apos;t see it at all."

Living Naked sorts out the concepts and tries to present us with the &quot;naked truth&quot; about naturalism. Through many testimonies, some very funny, some moving, through fascinating archive footage and a tour of the main naturist resorts in France and Germany. Living Naked explores, demystifies the taboos. Nor a voyeur, nor a proselyte, Director Robert Salis addresses the Adam or the Eve living inside of us. Just released on DVD in French, this is a unique must see feature film about naturalism."

If you don&apos;t like Star Trek but can live through the first 20 minutes you&apos;ll find a gem of a movie which is as much about the future of humanity &amp; an invention so wonderful as it is about Yet More Star Trek Plot.\n\nWarp Speed - they&apos;ve been saying that since Captain Kirk. But how did it happen? and why might it all not happen, our future could be in ruins and one flight of one makeshift spacecraft some time after world war III will make all the difference.\n\nThe on-screen relationship between Picard &amp; Lily is totally magic, as is the relationship between the Enterprise crew members - you get a sense of team, of family.\n\nFirst Contact is one film I enjoy watching again &amp; again. The flight of the Phoenix is one scene I totally love, along with the end scenes.\n\nThe only sad thing about the movie is that you come away and deep down you know there is no Cochrain, no FTL engine around the corner. Well, not yet!\n\n&quot;I envy you, the world you&apos;re going to&quot; &quot;I envy you, taking these first steps&quot;",

Her beauty really adds to this film. The sniveling Pippo and Mario, and the pompous Paolo, were pretty good roles. I&apos;ve never heard of the Italian actors who played them. Anthony Quinn was good, totally becoming his character. The ending, while not shocking, was unexpected. The version I saw was dubbed into English. Something odd about this and other Italian films I&apos;ve seen. It looks like (from the lip movement) that some of the actors are speaking in Italian and others are speaking in English. Maybe the dubbing and translation was just done that well. This is certainly a film worth seeing once.",

But it works, mostly because of Bill Murray&apos;s performance.\n\nA man who has to unload his father&apos;s trained elephant does not make for a promising story, comic or dramatic. What makes this film work is Murray&apos;s generally laid-back performance. His character -- a motivational instructor who teaches patient and thoughtful behavior -- displays such. He rarely gets badly upset, and there&apos;s little of the frantic slapstick one would expect from other actors. (I suspect Roy Blount was consciously writing such a story.) When a reviewer states that the film misses the obvious sight gags its premise suggests -- well, that&apos;s the point of it, right?\n\nThis isn&apos;t a film that demands a second viewing. But it&apos;s far better than you might expect, and its refusal to assault the viewer is welcome. It&apos;s a perfect film when you don&apos;t want to watch anything demanding.\n\nPS: I just love the parents who say this (and other films) are good family films because they lack sex, violence, adult language, etc. Unfortunately, most such films are garbage that pervert a child&apos;s taste.",

      "reviewBody": "...are indeed bound to repeat them. This cracking Soviet/Afghan war drama from director and actor Fyodor Bondarchuk has echoes of US war stories like Hamburger Hill, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but with none of the predictable American schmaltz, propaganda and dubiously good teeth. It grips the viewer entirely with impressive repertory performances from a great young cast of faces unknown to western audiences; deserving all of its accolades and every cent of the post-Soviet era record-breaking $20m the film has raked in. Worth a look for those who think current Western military ambitions in Afghanistan are anything but futile.",

To me, this film was about two people who were struggling with their inner desires, disappointments, hurts and longings. Both main characters were somewhat stiff in social situations. The uneasiness between them was understandable to me because of their past experiences. \n\nThe romantic scenes were awkward in my opinion because of a spinster who is within her shell; and a man struggling with his inner desire to be a priest. Plus it appears the characters were two introverts.\n\nYes indeed, the film was slow moving, just like real life is sometimes. I do not mind slow moving films, for films should not always be about speed and excess of excitement. There were some really good moments in this film. If you do not mind a story unfolding slowly, with an emphasis on dialogue, check out this film.",

In the beginning it&apos;s weird, slightly awkward, but then as I get familiar with the characters, it gets deep and emotional and goes right to the core of the dysfunctions of a rural swedish family and some of their friends. They have come together to celebrate the 70th birthday of their father. There is more and more the sense that something has got to give. Lots of feelings, lot of catharsis and opening up and moments of reckoning and trying to find a way forward. There is more than a few moments of comedy as well, and in the end this is a positive movie, not a depressing one. At the same time there is despair, dysfunction, tragedy. For me a great movie.",

This effort is surprisingly good and is more gritty and realistic than most war movies out there (not mentioning a few big budget titles). The acting is top notch and the original way it was filmed (over 10 years before Blair Witch) makes this one a gem to own in your vhs/dvd collection. I liked this film a lot and highly recommend it to any fan of &apos;Nam titles."

The movie doesn&apos;t accomplish this as well.  While the book is subtle with the Count&apos;s revenge, the movie screams for all to hear. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Edmund Dantes is going to get revenge on his friends!!!&quot; They left out 3 main characters, and DRASTICALLY changed the ending, they had to, the end involves those 3 characters they left out.  But I did like the movie and if you enjoy it too I encourage you to read the book!"

It appears that americans have lost perspective, not noticing the real dangers of life: pollution, traffic, e.t.c. With TV-channels telling stories only about violence and terrorism and populistic politicians scaring people to vote for them Americans trust only in themselves.\n\nMichael Moore tries with this movie to make the Americans consider and think for themselves being rationals, and to tell the rest of the world how the American society works. Really something to think about... See it, its necessary",

      "reviewBody": "This movie had something for everyone. The fact that the story is situated in the beginning of December and has a strong relation with the traditional celebration of Saint Nicholas&apos; birthday, makes it very, VERY Dutch. In a way, you can compare it to &apos;Alles is Liefde&apos; which is also unmistakably Dutch in its setting and theme. An important difference, compared to &apos;Alles is Liefde&apos; is that Bennie Stout uses the story of Saint Nicholas in such a way that it is very credible for little children, whereas Alles is Liefde shows you the fictional side of the story. Bennie Stout has a beautiful story-line that is filled with entertaining details (such as the absence board on Saint Nicholas&apos; boat that says &apos;Piet present/absent&apos; ten times, the detailed pepernoten-factory, the raft constructed from taai-taai, the acrobatic stunts of the Pieten, etc) and humor on both children level and adult level. The setting in an old Dutch village about a hundred years ago is brilliant and gives the audience one beautiful scenery after another. People who love nice shots and beautiful pictures will really love this film. Not that it has many beautiful people (most of them are ugly), but the gorgeous Hanna Verboom makes up for all the others. She is very well chosen for the part of the tender, caring, beautiful but tormented young mother. Of all adult actors she undoubtedly gives the best performance. The child actors are also very good: Koen Dobbelaer (Bennie) is brilliant and very charming, he makes it very credible that he&apos;s not really bad, just a little clumsy. His &apos;enemy&apos; Pieter Lossie (Roderick) is just as charming, though a little naughtier. For the role of Saint Nicholas there was only one serious candidate (Bram van der Vlugt) and I think Johan Nijenhuis was very lucky to have him for this part. One thing about the script that I liked very much is the fact that although the story has many strange and irrational elements, coming from the original myth (naughty children are really abducted by Saint Nicholas, all of his assistants are called Piet, the children are put into large bags, the Pieten climb in and out of chimneys) the actors act as if these things are completely normal. At night, the abducted children sleep in bags hanging from the ceiling, like it&apos;s completely normal and totally accepted. When the children are taken away, their parents react as if it&apos;s totally sane and inevitable. I like this absurdity a lot, it makes the movie really stand out. And I think it gives this movie a typically Dutch feel (see Alex van Warmerdam&apos;s Ober or Emma Blank or the two Paard van Sinterklaas movies). The last thing I want to mention is the music. I never heard so many variations of the traditional Saint Nicholas songs: jazz versions, classical versions, disco, opera, you name it. To paraphrase Saint Nicholas himself: &quot;I can never get enough of Sinterklaas Kapoentje, it&apos;s such an evergreen&quot;.\n\nWell, to make a long story short: there&apos;s something in this movie for everyone, it does not spoil young children&apos;s belief in the Saint, has a great story, it&apos;s very entertaining and very well crafted.",

      "reviewBody": "20th Century Fox&apos;s 1938 Alexander&apos;S RAGTIME BAND, Number 22 in their &quot;Studio Classics&quot; series, is with the exception of there 1927 SUNRISE (which was offered only as a promotional item), the earliest title to be offered and it turns out to be quite delightful!\n\nLike many musicals of the time the story is slight and mainly used to advance the musical portions, but this one boasts a large collection from the pen of one of the best -- IRVING BERLIN!\n\nFox had wanted to do a biography on Irving Berlin -- instead Berlin worked out the story idea of a fictional bandleader ushering in a whole new era of swing music. Berlin worked with Fox during the two year period that was needed to prepare this lavish musical -- and the results are very entertaining as it presents 28 of his most famous songs. Alfred Newman&apos;s handling of the music won him a well deserved Oscar.\n\nThe cast, which includes Tyrone Power, the delightful Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Jack Haley (the Tin Woodman in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;) and a young and very attractive looking Ethel Merman, soars under the hand of veteran director, Henry King. There really isn&apos;t a &quot;false note&quot; in acting department.\n\nOver all the picture rendered on the DVD is quite beautiful (though there are a few side scratches from time to time). The icing on this DVD is found in some marvelous &quot;Extras&quot;: First of all there is a very fine A&amp;E Biography, &quot;Alice Faye: The Star Next Door&quot;, that gives a wonderful account of this once very popular star. There are dozens of nice clips from her film work at Fox (that make you wish that Fox would put out an Alice Faye Collection of six or so of her films in a package like Universal did with Deanna Durbin). After watching this biography I felt like Miss Faye must have been a very nice person as well as a talented singer and actress.\n\nThe big surprise is found in the Commentary Track provided by Film Score Restorationist RAY FIOLA. I had the opportunity to meet this gentleman at a Film Score presentation at Brigham Young University. BYU holds the Max Steiner Collection, which includes a large number of phonograph recordings of sound track music that were used for playback as the scores as they were recorded on the sound stages. BYU has issued a series of sound track CD&apos;s made from their holdings. Fiola is one of the world experts on preparing these 78rpm records for transferring to CD&apos;s. His commentary on this DVD provides a wealth of information about Berlin, his songs and the actors and other behind-the-scenes people who brought ALEXANDER&apos;S RAGTIME BAND to life. He&apos;s more informative then a university film class -- and very interesting. This is one of the best of the Fox commentary tracks. Fiola even gives you information on ordering a CD of the ALEXANDER tracks that he worked on.\n\nThere is even more: How about three deleted scenes -- which means three deleted songs (and they are all very nice to see and hear). Also included are shots of Irving Berlin being interviewed at the London premiere of the film in newsreel footage.\n\nAll in all, this is a very nice addition to the Fox &quot;Studio Classics&quot; series -- one that is well worth adding to anyones collection who is interested in the history of the movies -- especially the history of film musicals.",

Sharon Stone is playing against type especially considering her later roles. She never fit this shy scared girl even when she was younger. It&apos;s really problematic. She is forced to overact. There is no good acting in this by anyone. The music gets kind of annoying which makes the horror thriller not scary at all. There are some weird nightmarish turns.

      "name": "Problematic but Intelligent thriller about the the relationship between audience and cinema",
      "reviewBody": "Basic Instinct was an entry into the neo-noir genre of the 90&apos;s (The Last Seduction, Fatal Attraction etc ) that tried to update 40&apos;s/50&apos;s American film noir as well as bringing in elements of Hitchcock&apos;s Vertigo. On this level Basic Instinct is a brilliant conveyor of noir themes that portrays an unstable detective out of control in an intricate unfathomable plot with a femme fatale, Hollywood mansions, dark shadowy rooms, smart cynical dialogue and smoking. It is also flawed on this level with its unnatural characterisation. However, the artificiality of the plot, genre, characterisations and the look creates a distance between the viewer and the film. When you take this into account along with the constant references to watching in the film, outlined below, the film moves to a different level. It is no longer about whether Catherine Tramell is the killer but is more about the spectatorial process of watching a (Hollywood) film.\n\nFor example, Catherine Tramell(Sharon Stone) is a writer whose murder plots exactly follow the murders that occur in the film. Her coolness and openness about these killings gives her a sense of being in control of Nick Curran&apos;s(Michael Douglas) destiny. In this way, she is like cinema itself spinning a predetermined plot line that the audience represented by Douglas just follows.\n\nThroughout the film, the detective seems resigned to his lack of control, totally in awe of Catherine Tramell ready to go along with her. This is similar to the way the audience submits itself inside the cinema to the control that the screen exerts. However just as we do, Curran attempts to predetermine the plot with his own expectations. He tells Tramell that he has his own idea how it will end - &quot;The cop survives&quot; - The final question of &quot;What do we do now, Nick?&quot; is met with &quot;F*** like minxes, raise rug rats, live happily ever after.&quot; another idealistic expectation of the cinema audience. However the ambiguous final shot reminds us that Douglas/the audience may not get the ending he wants - only cinema decides whether that ice pick under the bed will be used.\n\nAnother parallel with the cinema experience is the way Nick Curran seems to identify with Tramell. At the start he is a recovered smoker and drinker and Tramell gets him to start again. Over the course of the film his attraction to Tramell&apos;s character makes him take on more and more of her traits - aggressive sexuality, risk taking, use of her dialogue and more and more leaps into fantasy. He is almost merging with her and this is reflected in his interrogation scene being shot identically to Tramell&apos;s earlier one. Again this development mirrors the way cinema audiences identify with the film narrative. The Hollywood ideal is that the viewer leaves his/her outside of the cinema in order to temporarily identify with the fantasy characters on screen.\n\nAnother main aspect of the cinema experience touched on here is the voyeuristic process of watching itself. Curran is constantly in a spectatorial position. It is most obvious where he watches Tramell through a window that looks like a cinema screen itself. Another scene where he is trying to find out about Tramell on a computer sees him reprimanded by a colleague for &quot;jacking off to the screen&quot;. This likens Douglas to an audience member watching the film in a similarly voyeuristic way. This is the reason why Hitchcock is such a strong influence on this film - these are classic Hitchcockian themes.\n\nMy final comparison is the bi-directional aspect of cinema touched on in the film. The interrogation scene where Tramell manipulates the audience of detectives is the only time where Tramell has point of view, reminding us that cinema watches and manipulates us as well. Also the fact that throughout Tramell knows so much about Detective Curran&apos;s past is a similar device. Tramell uses what she knows about Curran to make her murder work, just as Hollywood exploits what it knows about our desires of movies in order to sell us their product. (And those desires may have been partly contrived by Hollywood).\n\nThe female murderers (who look like old film stars) that Tramell hangs around with represent other archetypal Hollywood stories - maybe these could have been other films that Nick Curran watched before when he took up smoking before.\n\nIs it a coincidence that the words &quot;cinema theatre&quot; can be found in the name Catherine Tramell and the word &quot;audience&quot; can be found in &quot;Detective Nick Curran&quot; ? \n\nProbably.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is lush with Gauguin&apos;s masterpieces, which are shown in context of his fascinating life story giving us background and insight into his inspired, colorful body of work.\n\nNarrated by Waldemar Januszczak, (an English art critic, arts editor of The Guardian and The Sunday Times, and television documentary), the film immediately drew me in with rich drumming music as the host stood on a beach the artist spent time at and asked: &quot;What&apos;s to like about this man, you might think? Well, first off, there&apos;s the art, which needs no defense. I reckon Gauguin painted some of the world&apos;s most alluring women, but what I really like about him is that he did it for really big and noble reasons and he put them into several of the world&apos;s most gorgeous pictures. There&apos;s always more to a Gauguin than meets the eye. This is the first film that follows in Gaugin&apos;s footsteps.&quot;\n\nThe film indeed follows Gauguin to each location he lived. He arrived in Peru as an 18 month-old with an older sister, Marie, and a newly widowed mother, Aline. There, he was raised in privilege in the home of relatives who held political power. Gauguin&apos;s childhood was both wonderful and traumatic. After his Peruvian relatives were ousted from power, his mother moved her family back to Paris.\n\nAfter school and a seven year stint in the navy traveling the world, Paul Gauguin married Matte, a tough, hard-partying Danish woman, when he was a successful stockbroker. He maintained this position for eleven years. After the 1882 stock market crash, he lost his income and devoted himself full tilt to painting full-time.\n\nGauguin did not desert his wife and five children, as is common lore. Matte, who enjoyed the comfortable life as a partner to a well off businessman, left him in 1885. She had no idea art would possess him as it did; nor did he. He was a passionate painter, sculptor, and potter with a penchant for yellow walls and flamboyant dress. He became a leader in the Symbolist school and painted with a proclivity for Primitivism.\n\nGauguin was comrades with numerous brilliant painters, among them, Pissarro, Cezanne, and Van Gogh. His relationships with them are covered in the narrative that travels from Peru to Paris, Pont-Avon, Tahiti, French Polynesia, the Marquesas Islands, and more.\n\nHis life was filled with drama, intrigue, and tragedy including the death of his beloved favorite child, Aline, which led to a suicide attempt. He was a bold, adventurous spirit with a desire to be live freely away from the bog of modern day civilization. He built and designed for himself spectacular living spaces, hedonistically pursued underage Vahines (women who were his lovers and muses) on the islands, and had a regal rendezvous with debauchery.\n\nI enjoyed the film immensely but needed breaks from it, so I watched the nearly two hour movie in blocks of thirty minutes at a time. It struck me as a comprehensive rendering of Gauguin&apos;s life. The host, Januszczak did such a thorough job, I&apos;m interested in seeing more of his work now.\n\nI recommend this as a must-see for lovers of Gauguin&apos;s artwork.",

Now I see it again and find that it is really difficult to shoot. It is called &quot;the great cause of the founding of the party&quot;, but ambition is to comb through the recordable modern history from the beginning, which is inevitable. However, it is not easy to balance commerciality and dedication. Although the theme of the whole film is unknown and no effective characters have been established, it is indeed the best work to balance the two characteristics mentioned above. In 1921, although the perspective is more concentrated and more &quot;people-friendly&quot;, it has lost the opening and closing under the background of the great era and become more &quot;small family spirit&quot;. When it comes to 110 years, we might as well follow the idea of the great cause of the founding of the party and make another concentrated attempt, which may have good results.",

The costumes for actors and house furnitures are polished, representing that era/period very well.\n\nThe songs are very good, actors have very good voice, especially Csobot Adél (Eszter in the movie).

That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s a serious football film, it certainly isn&apos;t and the ball game isn&apos;t even the main takeaway from events - it&apos;s more about people caring and coming together. It&apos;s rather nice.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing really noteworthy about the cast to be honest, Olivia d&apos;Abo (Anna) and Steve Guttenberg (Tom) are, I guess, the standouts. Kate&apos;s (Jessica Robertson) story has heart, as does Juan&apos;s (Anthony Esquivel), but they as actors don&apos;t get much to work with.\n\nPretty plain I&apos;ll admit, but I found &apos;The Big Green&apos; an enjoyable enough watch.",

      "reviewBody": "The dreams of two unlikely strangers form the basis for this sophisticated drama  one of a world that has been lost and the other of a world that has yet to be found.\n\nSnowflakes fall mysteriously in a grand ballroom somewhere in Russia, echoed in the mind of a beautiful girl in a slum district of Shanghai 1936. Natasha Richardson is a countess, fleeing the Bolshevik revolution, making a living any way she can to support her family. This means working in shady dance halls as a taxi-dancer (and presumably, occasionally, as a prostitute). Her five family members (all older except for a young daughter) loathe the shame she brings on them but have no other means of support.\n\nRalph Fiennes is a disillusioned US diplomat. He has helped the formation of the League of Nations, is a successful business man, and a hero Chinese nationalists, but has seen all the best efforts to have people live in peace come to nought. Shanghai is full of political tensions  just before the Sino-Japanese war. Fiennes finds solace drinking in lowlife bars and avoiding what he sees as the hypocrisy of those that hold him in such high regard.\n\nA vast amount of talent has been poured into this film: it is the final collaboration of Merchant and Ivory (Ismael Merchant died shortly before final production), the screenplay is by the award winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro (who worked with them on Remains of the Day), the other crew are top notch, and the cast also includes both Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave. Yet there is no easy conclusion when asking if it is a major triumph.\n\nThe film has a pervading sense of the unexplained, which continues for its whole length (over two hours), so piecing it together is not easy. The politics of the time and place are probably not familiar to most audiences, and the bewildering array of nationalities does not help. Ishiguru&apos;s talent is for transcending the material content and taking us into the world of ideas, but it needs most of our concentration to accept the material idea of Shanghai 1936 (which, although painstakingly recreated, often feels like a film set inhabited by a well-known English cast). Not surprisingly, there may be little energy left over for more cerebral imaginings. Fiennes is an American, Richardson and the Redgraves are Russian  even before we meet the Jewish neighbour, the French Consul, a Japanese nightlife connoisseur - and none of the main characters (or actors) are Chinese. But then the ideas are not particularly Chinese either  Shanghai is nothing more than Ishiguro&apos;s canvas.\n\nPrising out the dreams gives us some clues. Richardson (Sofia) is no tart-with-a-heart. Their Jewish neighbour, also a refugee, has fled such horrors that mere verbal insults (the worst he has to suffer in Shanghai) fall off him like a deaf man. But Sofia&apos;s family are less self-assured. They dream of a decent existence, but Sofia has the greatest moral fibre, in spite of her job. She receives the respects of a Russian Prince  now working as a porter. She warns Fiennes (Jackson)  who is also blind  of a hidden danger and gains his lasting respect.\n\nJackson has noticed that in the dance halls there are no politics. He longs for a nightclub where people of any political persuasion can relax and mingle freely. Like Sofia, he is tarnished by all the rules of the real world, but his aspirations are higher than his outward lifestyle and the &apos;bigger picture&apos; of those that would judge him.\n\nEarly in the film, Sofia says to a co-worker, &quot;All of us here have to fall in love from time to time to feed our children,&quot; yet the film turns many ideas of &apos;love&apos; on their head before it reaches its (thankfully) emotionally resounding climax. Equally ironically, Jackson speaks of the &quot;vague promise of an intimate encounter&quot; (in an ideal nightclub) when the reality is that merely the vague dream of any intimacy of feeling is the most either he or Sofia feel they could even hope for.\n\nAs a meditation on the commonality of death and sex, of the impotent struggle of goodness and taste against the wars that mankind seems addicted to, The White Countess has much to offer. The image of Fiennes in overcoat and bow-tie, calmly pouring brandy as the bombs fall around him, sticks in the mind like the scream of a child. Director James Ivory could have underscored such moments to much greater effect than allowing them to be swallowed in a complex story and an unfamiliar period of history. Fiennes&apos; character seeks some political tension that stops short of violence, but his character  and the film  often lack that very quality.\n\nWhat seems at first like instant noodles, badly re-heated, holds more sustenance than most will sadly give this film credit for; and if it is a triumph for the Merchant Ivory / Isuguro team, it is one, like its characters and their dreams, so heavily flawed that the aficionados who draw anything from it may well be accused of an over-active imagination.",

At once a portrait of a singularly strange individual, a history of post-war Yugoslavia, and a meditation on aging, this might be the most purely enjoyable essay film I&apos;ve ever seen. There are ways in which Innocence Unprotected strikes me as Makavejev&apos;s most personal movie, which is ironic since most of the footage isn&apos;t his own. Indeed, most of the movie is another movie: the first talkie made in the Serbo-Croation language. The original Innocence Unprotected was barely competently made by a then-famous body-builder, acrobat and escape-artist named Aleksic, a man of undeniable physical talents and almost impossible-to-believe narcissism, during the Nazi occupation. Aleksic insists his film was made surreptitiously, but rumor that it was made with the approval of the fascists makes Aleksic a pariah in post-war Yugoslavia. One can see why Aleksic&apos;s &quot;film&quot; might have have met with fascist approval. A valentine to his own muscles and bravery, it seems both a celebration of white, European strength and sheer force. Makavejev interviews Aleksic and the film&apos;s cast and crew in old age, as they share fond remembrances of their adventures under the occupation. This is interspersed with truly horrific and moving news footage of the sacrifices made by the people during the war and the bombing of the country at the time the artists were working. Makavejev seems simultaneously charmed and repulsed by Aleksic, as was I. He seems a living, breathing allegory of the twentieth century.",

The great cast and the beautiful `sightseeing&apos; of wonderful landscapes in the Italian islands and the gorgeous eyes and lips of Francesca Neri exhaustively showed by the director Manuel Pradal is not enough to make this movie attractive.

      "reviewBody": "L&apos;IVRESSE DU POUVOIR, which was oddly re-titled as A COMEDY OF POWER for the North American market (I saw it under LUST FOR POWER on cable), is a very good French flick about corruption in the government and a magistrate&apos;s attempts to bring the bad guys to justice. The magistrate is played by the sublime Isabelle Huppert. One could say that the film can viewed as some sort of black comedy about how controlling the corrupting qualities of power is ultimately futile. The film is played straight. There are no big Hollywood moments in it which for many will turn off most viewers. The film can be described as dry. Very dry. There are no mushy sentimental moments. No sex. No violence. Very little swearing. The dramatics are very low key. Heck, the music is almost non-existing. The direction is so minimalistic that it creates a tension of sorts in that I expected the director to shock us with something really bad just waiting to happen at any moment and ready to derail the whole controlled tone of the film.\n\nThe dialogue is spoken quickly and even though I understand French, the subtitles were good in keeping track with the rapid fire exchanges.\n\nAside from the assured direction, the main reason to watch L&apos;IVRESSE DU POUVOIR is Isabelle Huppert&apos;s laser sharp performance. She&apos;s so good and direct, not a wasted moment or emotion in her entire performance. It&apos;s something to behold. Watching the petite woman, with her red gloves and purse, corralling all these corrupt folks, is unforgettable and it&apos;s what remains in your head days after seeing the film. \n\nA very satisfying movie that&apos;s a nice change from the usually over-the-top approach most films take these days.",

A super cop taking down a gang of criminals. That&apos;s the plot. The undercover plot was interesting, but there was a weird abundance of plot for such a bland-looking action film.\n\nThe action scenes are the film&apos;s strength for sure. The action abounds here, with a great opening shootout, car/motorcycle chase, bar fight, alley fight, store fight, car chase, and the long climax consisting of two long and awesome shootouts. There&apos;s a long shootout where Arnold drives around in a car shooting fools to the tune of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; by The Rolling Stones. The best part? He puts the tape into the player at the start of the scene.\n\nThis is a severely blood-soaked action film, even by 80s standards, with lots of bloody violence. It&apos;s a little excessive. It also has an underrated acting performance from Arnold, a cool rocky 80s theme, and one of the best gear-up scenes ever. It&apos;s almost as good as the one in Hot Fuzz (2007).\n\nDefinitely give it a watch if you&apos;re an Arnold fan, or even an 80s action junkie. I still can&apos;t get over the greatness of the gloriously OTT final shootouts. This movie is painfully Arnold, and I love it.",

      "reviewBody": "Starter For Ten (three stars)\n\nDirector Tom Vaughan Writer David Nicholls Stars Ian Bonar, Alice Eve, Rebecca Hall, Catherine Tate Certificate 12A Running time 96 minutes Country UK / USA Year 2006\n\nDon&apos;t let the pathetically weak opening scene - a flashback of a university applicant as a boy, watching University Challenge and guessing the answers - put you off. Starter For Ten actually manages to get better. Although nominally about qualifying to be on the TV famous game show, the film is really a light-hearted coming-of-age drama set in the 80s. It has convincing performances and a lovingly recreated period of Thatcher Britain, when corduroy was cool and Kate Bush was for intellectuals.\n\nWorking class Brian was not born clever - he has to work at it. Gaining entry to a posh university, he meanders through undergraduate days with a classic dilemma: do you fall in love with the intellectually attractive brunette or the blonde goddess? Karl Marx, Freud and John Lennon, like smoking hash and learning how to do blowbacks, are all part of the social landscape of what is trendy and what isn&apos;t. Half way in, the film subject matter allows plenty of social commentary on the irksome British class divisions that penetrate romance, friendship and the University Challenge team.\n\nVersatile Catherine Tate puts in an amiable performance as Brian&apos;s ever supportive and cooing mother: she&apos;s having an affair with the ice-cream van man (&quot;you can hear him coming&quot;). This enjoyable no-brainer of a movie is aided and abetted by a blistering 80s soundtrack with bands such as The Cure, Psychedelic Furs, Buzzcocks, Yazoo, The Smiths, Tears for Fears, The Undertones - and Kate Bush.\n\nStarter for Ten is not searing drama, but it does make a pleasant and worthwhile trip down nostalgia lane. The characters are ones we can love and care about and the movie mostly avoids predictability and cheese. If &quot;the most important questions in life are the ones we already know the answer to,&quot; and are not exactly rocket science, the subject matter of Starter For Ten is a welcome and unpretentious antidote to the plethora of similar American teen comedies. If you like the music, it&apos;s worth going for that alone.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes forgotten, only one reviewer (the usual french cinema passionate conoisseur). I sadly get used to this general ignorance in french film noir. Shot in 1965, it&apos;s one of the last black and white french film noir (and the last black and white Cayatte movie). It&apos;s gripping from the stressful first scenes to the scary ending, it has a strong cinematographic writing. The story is built around the three characters played by Dany Carrel. If you love Dany Carrel like I do, it&apos;s definitely her must see in these three different and opposite characters, one being close to Falconetti in &quot;Passion de Jeanne d&apos;Arc&quot; by Dreyer, and there is even Madeleine Robinson playing Jeanne Murneau, couldn&apos;t it be kind of testimony of Cayatte to Black and White? Madeleine Robinson is still great with her tense presence from &quot;une si jolie petite plage&quot; to &quot;les Louves&quot; and others. in her book &quot;l&quot;Annamite&quot;, Dany Carrel said she was glad to play these three characters and find actors she had already played with, Jean Gaven and Madeleine Robinson (often as her mother). Journalists and critics loved that movie, but the movie didn&apos;t have success in theatres, only on tv some years later. Author Japrisot is adapted by great Jean Anouilh, so there is a large panel of dialogues for each very opposite characters. All settings are well chosen, from italian villas to typical french garage (that have mainly disappeared today).",

I don&apos;t understand some of the plot lines why these kids all knew each other, but who cares? Stick a bunch of hot looking guys and girls in some aboriginal sacred sight with a nutcase and a curse and chainsaws and aromatherapists and was a lot more enjoyable than Transformers 2 for my money! \n\nThe music rocked (Ladytron!) and it was pretty funny and there were two pretty good scares though the girls were pretty freaked out most of the way through. \n\nThe end credits and &apos;making of&apos; were very funny and all in all the best 90 minutes of Christams 2009!\n\nI&apos;m still not sure what exactly what we saw but we&apos;re gonna see it again with a living room full of beer!",

      "reviewBody": "A simplification of the first part of the 13th century epic poem «Nibelungenlied,» concerning the story of Siegfried (Sigfrido, here) fighting the dragon, gaining access to King Gunther&apos;s court and winning his confidence, wooing his sister, princess Kriemhild (Crimilde), fooling Queen Brünhild/Brunilde, and ignoring courtier-warrior Hagen&apos;s palace intrigues, which lead to Sigfrido&apos;s death.\n\nFor good measure, the scriptwriters added part of Crimilde&apos;s revenge, solved in the last minutes, in a fast sequence. Unfortunately for me the copy of the film (at least the one I can appreciate best, with Spanish translations) is not of the best quality: the hues and colors change constantly to the point that I felt that it was a visual strategy. It is a pity because it was conceived as a lavish adventure film for youngsters, with elements of Medieval fantasy throughout the story (in spite of being a tragic story).\n\nFor its time and the resources the personnel had, it is attractive: while it is true that Carlo Rambaldi&apos;s dragon is far from his later fine achievements, but to be fair it is not too different from the dragons, sea serpents and other monsters we saw in other productions of the 1950s and 1960s. The work by production designer Beni Montresor and cinematographer Carlo Nebiolo is above average, composer Franco Langella makes good use of themes by Richard Wagner, and the whole cast is more than serviceable, especially German actor Sebastian Fischer, projecting much enthusiasm as the young Sigfrido.",

Fabio Testi stars as Luca Di Angelo, a cigarette smuggler / family man who does have some principles. His organization is now constantly being threatened by rival outfits who want to control the drug traffic in the area. Luca is ready for revenge when one of the first victims is his brother Mickey (Enrico Maisto), but the bad guys, led by the power hungry Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzuffi) up their game when they decide to kidnap Lucas&apos; wife and son.\n\nThe script, credited to four people (including Fulci) is ultimately very routine. There&apos;s nothing special about any of the characters, even if they are entertainingly played. Testi, as always, is a rugged and studly &quot;hero&quot;. The joy here lies in the fact that the movie is so utterly violent. A face is burned to a crisp with a torch, a throat is torn open, a head is shot apart, and bodies are continuously riddled with bullet holes.\n\nSupporting Mr. Testi are Ivana Monti as Lucas&apos; wife, Saverio Marconi as the cocky young mafia man Perlante, Fabrizio Jovine as a police chief, and Ajita Wilson as Luisa. The actors are fine, especially Mr. Bozzuffi as a thoroughly nasty and despicable villain.\n\nThe action set pieces are not spectacular, but they are fun, and Fulci gives this trashy story (complete with full frontal female nudity as well as gore) decent pacing and a visceral appeal.\n\nFans of Fulcis&apos; bloody horror films from this period may also like this feature.\n\nLook for Fulci near the end in a cameo as one of the gunmen.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

That the same studio remade it post-code is remarkable, I just wish Myrna was given the wife role this time, opposite her old friend Joan. Unfortunately, when Myrna left MGM for Fox to film The Rains Came, Greer assumed many of her roles, beginning with Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Myrna, in her un-diva way, cites Greer&apos;s generosity to her decades later while touring,apparently oblivious to the fact she enabled Garson&apos;s star turn. No wonder Loy was friends with Crawford for fifty years!). There is no such thing as a bad Myrna movie, this one also scores points for trivia like the terrace beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, when&apos;s the last time you saw that?! Any old movie can be criticized for many things,but eyebrows? No wonder today&apos;s hits come from comic books..."

      "reviewBody": "Firstly I must justify that this will be a better film if one has not watched many of Tsai Min Liang&apos;s movies. As I have seen nearly all(except for the previous one, Bu San) this is a great disappointment to me. As of all his movies which are low budget, nearly no music and having minimum dialog, Tsai has always successfully used silence to hit our sense but I think this one is a failure.\n\nExcept for the female nude(probably the ugliest looking porno actress) scenes, nearly everything else has been done in his previous movies; water problem, use of water melon, musical interludes, the same few faces,masturbation, quiet apartments, etc. And like all his previous films(Bu San, I am not sure) there is always a link with the same characters name and plot or the same style of movie making, this one looks like a sum up of all his previous movies, with more sex and nude scenes for box office appeal. Lets see what else can he offer next ?\n\nThis time the female lead gets more scenes than before but I think she did not act well enough(even her moaning is poor and unrealistic compared to the Japanese) and Tsai&apos;s frequent actor, Lee Kang Sheng who never failed to bare or do some lonely sex, did the extreme in this one but unfortunately he appeared old and a bit out of shape.\n\nOnly the musical interludes saved the movie but they are not as well made as in his previous The Hole. \n\nLets hope this is not going to be the end of Tsai Min-Liang&apos;s directing career.",

Perhaps the movie would have been better if they&apos;d contributed to the script as well? They certainly know the territory better than most!\n\nAnyway, you&apos;ve got some silly clothes, a few obvious digs at the fads of the era, some enjoyable disco and metal on the soundtrack, and best of all a really eclectic supporting cast (Devo!).

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Size does matter.&quot;  So proclaimed the ad campaign of the Americanized Godzilla foisted upon us by Emmerich and Devlin in 1998.  If only they had paid more attention to movies like this before they tried to retool Godzilla.  Because their overgrown iguana is no match for the towering behemoth of indestructible, nuclear-fueled fury introduced in this movie.\n\nUntold legions of fans grew up with the original Godzilla in the &apos;60s and &apos;70s.  We found comfort in the quite cheesy special effects, massive plot holes, extreme overacting, and hilarious dubbing.  Not to mention the martial strains of Akira Ifukube&apos;s trademark musical scores.  The heisei series of second generation Godzilla movies may have offended some purists, but did stick with many of the same elements.  Many of the effects were now very good, but others were still unintentionally laughable.  The dubbing, of course, was as bad as ever.  Logic is the last thing one should expect from a Godzilla plot, and it&apos;s not very much in evidence here.  But this is all how we like it!\n\nFrom the tortuous contortions of the time travel plot came a new Godzilla, leaner and far meaner than ever before.  No more would he be the protector of Japan.  Along with the new origin backstory for Godzilla, we&apos;re treated to one for this new King Ghidora, which resembles the original Ghidrah only in name and appearance.  But while it took the combined might of all of Japan&apos;s monsters to slay Ghidrah, the new and improved Godzilla singlehandedly slew Ghidorah without working up a sweat.  Truly a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame that the second generation films were never released theatrically in the US and only recently released on video.  Americans deserved to see that there wasn&apos;t a vacuum between Godzilla 1985 and Godzilla (1998).  And a generation of American kids, too young to find the old films interesting, lost a chance to be hooked on what&apos;s arguably a cultural icon.",

Clint Eastwood has a small part at the end of the film as the fighter squadron leader. The effects by Clifford Stine are classic and Jack Arnold again proves his worth as director(before moving on to the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; in the 1960s). Leo Carroll is superb as Professor Deemer, who develops a formula for a growth serum. It is this serum(with uses an atomic isotope)that produces rapid growth in all the lab animals,including the Tarantula. The acting is very good, the movie has a nice pace and the effects for their time are top-notch. This is one 1950s sci-fi film to see!",

He does one of those patented foxy grandpa roles that he honed to perfection in such films as The Devil And Miss Jones and The More The Merrier.\n\nCoburn plays one of the richest men in the world, Rockefeller type rich and the film opens in the Rockefeller town of Tarrytown where Coburn is one of their neighbors. He&apos;s making out a last will and testament and since he&apos;s got no family of any kind, he&apos;s decided to leave his money to the Blaidells who are the descendants of the woman he once courted, but who married someone else.\n\nBut of course the Blaisdells do bear checking out so Coburn gets out of his sickbed where he&apos;s enjoying all attention he&apos;s been getting and visits them incognito. The family consists of husband and wife Larry Gates and Lynn Bari and children Piper Laurie, Gigi Perreau, and William Reynolds. Bari is the daughter of his lost love, but she&apos;s got a lot of social climbing pretensions, Coburn sees more of his former sweetheart in her granddaughter Piper Laurie. Piper&apos;s going out kind of with the soda jerk in her father&apos;s pharmacy Rock Hudson. But Skip Homeier is hanging around and he&apos;s the son of the wealthiest people in their town and that&apos;s a match Lynn Bari would prefer.\n\nCoburn gives them a test run so to speak. First he finagles his way into boarding with them under an assumed name. Then like John Beresford Tipton he bequeaths on them anonymously a check for $100,000.00. Of course it all goes to Bari&apos;s head and she drags the rest of the family somewhat reluctantly into a new lifestyle.\n\nHas Anybody Seen My Gal is set in the Roaring Twenties and the music score is of that period, popular tunes played in the background and occasionally done by the cast. Coburn has some incredibly good scenes here with Gigi Perreau, he saves Piper Laurie from being arrested in a speakeasy raid, and does a mean Charleston once he learns. Bari comes off second best in the cast as a woman who learns that even comparative wealth can bring with it all kinds of problems. Her family the Blaisdells learns in a more humorous way, the lesson George Bailey learned that no man is a failure who has friends. We can&apos;t all be millionaires.\n\nFour years away from when they shared Oscar nominations for Giant, Rock Hudson and James Dean were in the same film. Dean had some small bit parts in a few films and television work before hitting it big. This is one of those bits and you can plainly recognize him as one of the Roaring Twenties kids at the drugstore soda fountain.\n\nHas Anybody Seen My Gal did good things for stars Rock Hudson and Piper Laurie, but this film belongs to Charles Coburn and the marvelously droll and funny performance he gave.",

      "reviewBody": "Inspired by having seen the provocative Reconstruction last year, I watched Allegro last night and found it to be just spectacular. I think Boe is one of those amazing Renaissance people, whose skills crossover like blossoming fireworks.Above all else, I appreciate his concepts, which become his story lines.Supporting them is his very idiosyncratic visual style. The film is dark and moody, like its protagonist, and there is little dialogue. Long contemplative shots are frequently interrupted by a barrage of split-second images- the equivalent of memory flash cards. The cartoon story that plays during the film&apos;s introduction- tells the simple story one is about to see unfold. It&apos;s basically a one sentence story about the necessary role that deep feelings play in the life of any great artist. I see that simple story as a spider, and the ensuing film as the web around the spider. I particularly like it that the narrator clearly tells us, at the very beginning, what the film is about, and then we spend the next hours watching that spider web be built and travelled. What a fascinating world Boe creates.\n\nI must say I am very surprised to have not seen much IMDb discussion of this film . I only hope that many more people will soon have the pleasure of its experience.",

      "reviewBody": "I found Sweet Home Alabama to be a very sweet romantic comedy, Reese Witherspoon was just so adorable in this film. I wanted to see Sweet Home Alabama because I love Reese and remember hearing so much about it when it was released. So, of course, I figured now would be a good time to rent it and find out what this movie was about. Over all, I&apos;d say it was a bit over rated(everyone I knew who saw this movie loved it), but still a watchable romantic comedy.\n\nSweet Home Alabama is about a girl, Melanie, she is about to marry the mayor of New York city&apos;s son. But she has a bit of a bumpy past in the south where her family and old friends are, she&apos;s still married to Jake, her high school sweetheart. Without trying to bring up her embarrassing past to her fiancée, she has to get things done and settled with everyone, including her husband. But she slowly discovers how much she missed her true home and how much of a wonderful guy that Jake is.\n\nA bit predictable and silly, but over all I would recommend Sweet Home Alabama for a lite comedy that most could enjoy. Like I said, it&apos;s not that big of a deal, but I love Reese Witherspoon personally, so you might disagree, but then again, how will you know if you don&apos;t give the movie a shot? So, sit back and just have fun! \n\n6/10",

The Dandy Warhols formed in Portland. They befriend another unknown band called The Brian Jonestown Massacre. For them, the BJM are a bunch of fun guys from the big city who are way cooler than them. BJM&apos;s leader Anton Newcombe is a musical genius. He and Courtney Taylor-Taylor become the best of friends. They find comradery in their common leadership and as main creators in their bands. As the Dandys take off, BJM remains stuck in band infighting, and Anton&apos;s volatile self-destruction. The bands&apos; friendship descends into Anton&apos;s unwanted rivalry and his desperate love-hate relationship with the Dandys.\n\nMost music band biography deals with a famous band&apos;s rise and fall. It&apos;s a very familiar formula and one that can be stale. This one is different since it&apos;s about a band that never made it. The juxtaposition of the Dandys and BJM&apos;s different paths is really compelling. It is the world of 90&apos;s A&amp;R, the arrogance of genius, the drug haze, and the obsession for fame. It never convinces me of Anton&apos;s genius. It only give glimpses of their songs. Their live sets are never that long before a fight breaks out. The difference between the two bands is actually quite informative. More than any other band biography, this shows the pitfalls. If nine tenths of bands fail, this is a more realistic story of an up and comer.",

It&apos;s about a man who uses and maintains a 19th century water powered workshop. Ben is basically a blacksmith who creates items needed by local farmers. Items they can&apos;t just order out of a catalog. It was almost hypnotic the way this man could do almost anything in that water powered mill. From creating a sled for moving logs to modifying a garden fork into a sod removal tool. Even though he had electricity, he let the falling water power the machinery, not so much for historical reasons, but for practicality. The overhead leather transmission belts and wooden pulleys and shafts were fascinating to watch. Ben&apos;s skill, ingenuity and abilities just seem inexhaustible. Unfortunately, when my cousin passed away 13 years ago, his family threw away all of his video tapes before I could rescue any of them. If you ever get a chance to see this documentary, definitely watch it and see an example of what things were like before the modern era. I hope I get to see this again sometime.",

Give this woman the role she deserves! Maybe Steve Balderson&apos;s &quot;Firecracker&quot; really will be the comeback role some people are saying it is. Also, interesting to note is this film&apos;s young star, Trevor St. John, has become quite the fan favorite of daytime, as he is now starring on ABC&apos;s &quot;One Life To Live&quot;. A few other interesting folks pop up like Mary Stuart Masterson and Jon Favreau, but most entertaining is Natasha Gregson Wagner as the mentally challenged daughter of Karen Black&apos;s character. She plays the character exactly how you would imagine any child raised by a Karen Black character - totally whacked out!",

      "reviewBody": "Another film watched in preparation for the &quot;How Did This Get Made Podcast&quot;. Whilst it&apos;s certainly not great, or even good, it&apos;s a little better than most of the other films I&apos;ve watched for them.\n\nLonely Geppetto (Martin Landau) fills his time making puppets, in the Italian town he lives in. One day he carves a new marionette out of a magical piece of wood and that night it comes to life. This puppet, Pinocchio (Voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas), struggles with his naivety and his trusting nature and soon his misfortune is exploited by Lorenzini (Udo Kier) who makes him the star of his puppet show.\n\nSo first, I have to say that I struggled enormously with the version of this film that&apos;s on UK Amazon Prime. I don&apos;t think it was my internet connection, as both immediately before and afterwards streaming was working fine, but whilst viewing this film I was plagued with freezes, blank screens and framerate issues. It very nearly rendered it unwatchable and I kept having to stop and restart the film in order to make it bearable.\n\nFrom what I could make out then, visually the film was pretty strong. There&apos;s a lot of excellent work done in set design and background effects. The Czech Republic doubles for Italy nicely at whatever year the story was supposed to be set in (Mid 1800s?). The visual effects towards the end are pretty solid too. It&apos;s odd, but interesting, to see so many UK comedy actors flown out for very little. Dawn French has two scenes, John Sessions one and Griff Rhys Jones has about one line. Big fan of Bebe Neuworth in anything, even if here she and Rob Schneider are pretty tiresome in this.\n\nThe puppet of Pinocchio, though really well made, is a bit creepy. There are general issues with the film stock used and the quality of the dialogue recording (even allowing for the issues I was having streaming it). It looks like it could have been made twenty years earlier than 1996, but what&apos;s very 1996 is the CGI cricket that fulfils the conscience role. It&apos;s both terrible to look at and the script given to veteran vocal performer David Doyle is full of modern idioms and the worst self-referential puns you could imagine.\n\nWhilst I admire the effort that&apos;s gone into it, &quot;The Adventure of Pinocchio&quot; has aged like a fine yoghurt and unfortunately wasn&apos;t that good to begin with.",

The best performance comes from Roxburgh as The Duke--excellent job.\n\nIt will appeal to fans of Kidman and McGregor but is certainly not the sort of musical suited to everyone&apos;s taste."

      "reviewBody": "Enchanting Schlagerfilm / hit film with Caterina Valente and Rudolf Prack\n\nThe great Caterina Valente, who only turned 90 years old on January 14th, 2021, can be seen in this film by Paul Martin (&quot;A Blonde Dream&quot; and &quot;Glückskinder&quot;, both with the unforgettable Lilian Harvey), which premiered in 1959 at the UFA-Palast in Essen, once again showing their very best side. The Schlagerfilm / hit film was produced as usual by Artur Brauner and his CCC-Film. Filming took place in La Spezia, Italy, and in the CCC film studios in Berlin.\n\nIn an enchanting French port town (La Spezia :-), the seamstress Catherine (Caterina Valente) meets the German sailor Willi Schulz (Dietmar Schönherr, 1926-2014, with GOLDEN GLOBE nominee Lilo Pulver in &quot;Kohlhiesel&apos;s Daughters&quot; and also as an action star alongside Brad Harris in &quot;White Cargo for Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;The Secret of the Chinese Carnation&quot;) know and love. The busy sailor, who of course has a different bride in every port, promises the trusting Catherine that he will get back to her. When she still hasn&apos;t heard from her Willi after three months, she travels to sinful Hamburg to look for the unreliable rascal. But since there are many Willi Schulzens in the German Navy, the search is not that easy. Luckily, the handsome captain Chris Behrens (Rudolf Prack, 1905-1981), who secretly has his eye on the lovely Catherine, can help. Much to the dismay of his annoying fiancée (Helen Vita)! Catherine, who can also sing excellently, becomes a celebrated star in St. Pauli with the help of a chance acquaintance (Valente&apos;s brother Silvio Francesco), who is looking for his father (Rudolf Vogel), who went missing in Hamburg. Then heartbreaker Willi appears again. Catherine has to decide...\n\nIn this predictable plot, which certainly cannot quite achieve the charm of &quot;Hier bin ich, hier bleib ich / Here I am, here I stay&quot; and &quot;Das einfache Mädchen / The Simple Girl&quot; (Ruth Stephan is missing at all ends!!!), Caterina Valente sings the songs &quot;Look I to the sky&quot;, &quot;I know everything about you&quot; and &quot;It was in Portugal in May&quot;. The exterior shots in La Spezia at the beginning of the film are beautifully done, giving the plot a shimmering shine. The fantastic comedians Trude Herr (1927-1991, &quot;Natürlich die Autofahrer / Naturally the Drivers&quot;) and Brigitte Mira (1910-2005, &quot;Angst essen Seele auf / Fear Eats the Soul&quot;, &quot;Willi and the Windzors&quot;, &quot;The Wicherts from Next Door&quot;) also enchant in supporting roles. .\n\nEven if this light hit comedy is certainly not the best of Valente&apos;s works, the star was well received not only in German-speaking countries. The lively color film was also sold to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Greece and Romania. It&apos;s just a shame that the Caterina Valente films haven&apos;t been shot in widescreen format yet! That would be incredibly beautiful!",

If ever good can be portrayed as coming out of bad, it is the deeply moving message and point of making a movie like this. Who needs convincing that war is evil, that life is cruel and that love conquers all its madness? Who can even begin to understand the torment of post-traumatic stress? Those who perpetrate suffering not only to humans but animals alike can never have the empathy that defines us as human. On many levels, the story and how it is told, speaks to the heart and we weep in sympathy for the pain of those who suffer whether from mental illness, bullying or the unspeakable abuses of war. Where have all the great movie makers like Alan Parker gone? There is nothing but fake, shallow and profit orientated products that mirror the fake, shallow and insecure &quot;virtual&quot; relating that goes on today. For that I weep. It has created a hunger deeper than that suffered from starving Biafra.",

      "reviewBody": "The Phoenicians flourished at about the same time as the Greeks and Romans that are more familior to us but they were never a kingdom, just a series of city-states along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Tyre may be their best-known city and port. They were merchants whose influence extended throughout the Mediterranean, from the Levant, to Egypt, Italy, Greece, Spain, Sicily, and northern Africa. And they absorbed cultural traits and artifacts from the places where they traded. We owe our alphabet to them. They ripped off the Egyptian syllabary and instead of syllables, assigned individual speech sounds to each glyph. The Egyptian glyph of an open hand, for instance, was adapted and assigned the speech sound of &quot;d&quot;. (The drawing of the hand later turned into Greek &quot;delta&quot; and then our own &quot;D&quot;.\n\nThe Phoenicians were terrific traveling salesmen. They harvested the Cedars of Lebanon and sold them to kings. \n\nThe program doesn&apos;t use reenactors but it does focus on the genetic background of the Phoenicians. You can trace it through DNA but that requires drawing blood samples. Historian Spencer and others have surprisingly little trouble because the fishermen of Tyre are anxious to find out about their own history.\n\nNice, well-organized program about a neglected culture of the Ancient Middle East."

At first I was charmed by the studio lot setting and the curiously out of place fight sequences, but eventually the poor editing and confused narrative line left me impatiently waiting for the credits to roll. The director attempts to tell a sprawling story of one man&apos;s tumultuous maturation within the context of South Korean political situation during the second half of the 20th century. And although I&apos;m not acquainted with that history, it seems the film takes a very simplistic approach to the period&apos;s temperaments. The filmmakers simply try to do too much, eventually diminishing the potency latent in the socio-political situation as well as the engaging performance of the lead actor. The film definitely has more of a movie of the week feel to it with all its heavy-handedness and slap-dash film-making. The fact that the film was rushed (ironically, much like the films being satirized within the film) is most evident in a sequence where the lead and another actor sit in front of a store in the 1960s with modern NFL gear inside. Now i&apos;m not a stickler for continuity but c&apos;mon.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dead Silence&quot; is a movie that I had been highly anticipating ever since I saw the trailer for it. I just got back from seeing it and I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all. The film follows Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten), who, after receiving a mysterious puppet, returns home to find his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan) murdered. With a detective (Donnie Wahlberg) convinced he is the murderer, Jamie returns to his childhood town of Raven&apos;s Fair, where a legendary ghost story is told. The story is about a woman named Mary Shaw, a ventriloquist who was murdered after being suspected of murder. She was buried with her massive amount of dolls and puppets as well. After her death, it seems she has been taking revenge on the townspeople, when numerous families are found dead with their tongues missing. Jamie takes it upon himself to solve the legend and curse before he becomes the next victim.\n\nDirected/co-written by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell, the men who brought us the successful &quot;Saw&quot; series, are also behind this splendidly spooky horror film. Originality is a hard thing to find in the horror genre these days, but this film manages to sluff off most of the typical horror set-ups and create an interesting and compelling story. This is quite a turn around from the &quot;Saw&quot; franchise, which, while it is a good series, has become more of a gore fest than anything. On the other hand, &quot;Dead Silence&quot; is a supernatural horror film with a very well written story. Character development is strong, and the acting helps that out as well, which is always a plus. Ryan Kwanten, an Australian actor, plays the lead role and is very believable. Donnie Wahlberg (of &quot;Saw II&quot; and &quot;Saw III&quot;) plays a skeptical detective, and Amber Valetta (&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;) plays Jamie&apos;s new stepmother. All of the acting was really believable, I didn&apos;t see any below-average performing here.\n\nPuppets and ventriloquism are main themes in the plot, which might sound a little clichéd. I suppose it is, puppets and dolls have become almost a joke in the genre because they are so over-used (as well as creepy little children, among other things), but since they are in the core basis of the plot, they actually come off as being scary. People who have that fear of dolls and/or puppets would be advised to steer clear of this film. There is some great sets in the film as well. The entire town of Raven&apos;s Fair has a heavily Gothic tone to it, almost to the point of complete surrealism. The sets are spooky and appropriately so, because it really adds the atmosphere of the movie. The villain/ghostly ventriloquist Mary Shaw, was actually quite terrifying. Her makeup effects made her one creepy looking woman. As for the gore, those expecting anything close to the over-abundance of violence in the &quot;Saw&quot; films will be disappointed. This film doesn&apos;t contain much gore - it has a little, but it doesn&apos;t use typical violence and graphic gore to get some scares out of the audience. I loved the way the movie ended as well. It&apos;s a twist-ending, but don&apos;t let that put you off - it works well with the rest of the movie, it&apos;s not one of those &quot;bad movie twists&quot;. It was very unexpected and very well-written.\n\nOverall, &quot;Dead Silence&quot; is a refreshing, semi-unique horror movie. The storyline is original enough, and the creepy themes and atmospheric setting add to its overall effect. Don&apos;t expect a gore fest though, because the violence is pretty tame compared to what you&apos;d see in the &quot;Saw&quot; films. If you like James Wan and Leigh Whannell&apos;s work, I&apos;d really recommend seeing this - it&apos;s a pleasant change from your typical horror films, and a nice change of pace from their previous work. It has a few flaws here and there, but it&apos;s such an enjoyable movie that all of that is forgivable in the end. Very refreshing. 9/10.",

After that for almost one hour nothing happens.\n\nThe rubber mask head n the intestines r unintentionally funny.\n\nThe last twenty mins contains the two nasty scenes coz of which this film earned the video nasty label. The cinematography is good. The island location is able to capture an eerie atmosphere. The abandoned town, the alleys n the cemetery added to it&apos;s creepiness but the end product is boring.\n\nThe killer&apos;s tilted bald head is actually laughable. Eastman in a non dialogue role is a big lol.\n\nIn one scene while the killer is munching on the fetus, one character is shown injured but what happens to that character is never explained. In another scene the killer spares the blind girl. Wtf man. In the well scene, a hand suddenly pops up n pulls a girl inside. The well is more than half empty n i cant understand how the killer is able to come up n pull the girl into the well and in the next scene he is in the water which is much further down.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake of the sixties classic of the same name has unfortunately been somewhat slated by critics, although I feel it&apos;s better than most people seem to think it is.\n\nThe location work is stunning and the set design has clearly had a lot of work put into it.\n\nLiam Neeson, Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones all perform their parts quite well, but Lili Taylor is not as good as she should be. On paper she should be perfect for the role of Nell and for much of the film she provokes the necessary sympathy. She seems unable, however, to scream properly, instead letting what sounds like an animal cry. Also, she seems to say &quot;Oh No&quot; in exactly the same tone of voice every time she sees something frightening, although to be fair this is as much the fault of the script as it is hers.\n\nTowards the end the atmosphere is slightly diluted by such things as having the beds and statues spring to life which makes these scenes much less frightening than they could be.\n\nIn spite of all this, this movie has a certain something that regardless of it&apos;s faults, makes me want to watch it again and again, and ultimately you can&apos;t ask much more from a film than that.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Street Trash&apos; the most offensive film ever made? Quite possibly. This baby is exceedingly hard to locate, which is unfortunate, because it is an outlandish, unapologetic delight with a wonderful streak of black, black humour. Director Jim Muro has since become one of the most respected Steadicam operators in the business, and has worked his magic upon some pretty big pictures. I believe he was the Steadicam operator on &apos;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&apos;, but I might be wrong.\n\nWhen an enterprising liquor store owner in New York&apos;s Lower East Side(?) finds a dusty crate of something named Tenafly Viper stashed behind a brick wall in a back room of his place of business, he decides to sell it cheaply to the bums in the neighbourhood who are his chief customers. But Tenafly Viper is strong stuff indeed; strong enough to melt one&apos;s body! And you thought hangovers were bad.\n\nPretty soon, the homeless population around the liquor store is dwindling as more and more of these unfortunates consume this deadly drop and promptly disintegrate. The first bum to imbibe the killer stuff does so while seated upon a filthy lavatory. He melts into the commode, pulls the chain, and flushes himself away! Truly tasteless, n&apos;est pas? Two more memorable scenes from &apos;Street Trash&apos; come to mind: in one, a man has his penis bitten off; in the other, a man is spectacularly decapitated by a flying gas cylinder. I read in Fangoria(?) that this scene required eight special effects crew members to pump blood! &apos;Street Trash&apos; reminds me of Peter Jackson&apos;s wonderful &apos;Bad Taste&apos; which, while far superior to &apos;Street Trash&apos;, is in the same outrageous vein. I guess it might also be likened to &apos;The Incredible Melting Man&apos;, although the special effects makeup in that picture was provided by the legendary Rick Baker - his first film? - and so is much better than anything in &apos;Street Trash&apos;.\n\n&apos;Street Trash&apos; is an excellent title, because trash is what this film is all about. Its milieu is grimy and bleak, and everything about the whole affair is inherently unclean. Oh yeah, I just remembered another memorable scene: a cop fights a man in a men&apos;s room, and beats him to the ground. Then the cop sticks two digits down his own throat and vomits upon the prone man! Pretty sick (excuse the pun)! This film also makes me think of John Waters in its examination of white trash, something Waters did with films such as &apos;Desperate Living&apos; and &apos;Pink Flamingoes&apos;. Like those flicks, &apos;Street Trash&apos; serves up plenty of gross-out gags so, if that is what floats your boat in a movie, then you will certainly enjoy this. I hope &apos;Street Trash&apos; has a huge cult following, and I suspect it does. And deservedly so.\n\nWhen oh when oh WHEN is the DVD Special Edition going to be released?! I for one await it with great anticipation. By the way, if you do find this film, do not miss the song which plays over the end credits - very funny stuff! The last time I watched &apos;Street Trash&apos; I was laughing because one of the bums reminded me of Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes fame. Sorry, Mr Robinson... no offence intended!",

The movie itself is very lethargic, with occasional car action waking things up. There is no nudity and a low body count. I can&apos;t see this as much more than a television movie of the week. The love interest is simply like an add on. The Porches are fine and everything, but as fast as the cars are, the plot seems to crawl, especially in the beginning. None of the characters are likable, and some are severely underdeveloped. Honestly, you want car chases, there are better choices. The best way I can describe &quot;No Man&apos;s Land&quot; would be underwhelming. It&apos;s watchable, but just barely. .................................. MERK",

      "reviewBody": "Fascinating film. A sly comedy with terrific music has Molly Picon posing as a boy (for safety) and traveling the countryside with her father after they have been dispossessed. As musicians, they meet up with a pair of wanderers and the four strike up some merry music and get involved in various situations, including a wedding and a theater.\n\nPicon is no more convincing as a boy than were Marion Davies or Barbra Streisand in various films, but you suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Picon is a major comic talent and also had a nice singing voice. Also good in the cast as Simche Fostel as her father, Max Bozyk as Izak, and Leon Liebgold as Froim. Dora Fakiel is funny as the widow Trauba.\n\nJoseph Green wrote, produced, and directed this film, shooting in Poland in 1935/36. The film has almost a documentary feel at times, capturing the look and sounds of rural Poland before the German invasion in 1939. It&apos;s a world long gone. Green filmed three more movies up through 1938 and escaped Poland with his films and returned to America.\n\nYIDDLE WITH HIS FIDDLE was certainly a low-budget affair, but it was a worldwide hit in its day, especially in New York City where its box office clout rivaled that of any Hollywood film of the day. \n\nHighlights of the film are the wedding party scene and Picon&apos;s musical turn on a theater stage after she has ditched the boy&apos;s disguise. The film is available from several sources and has English subs. \n\nIn a final and sad note, Green never made another film after 1938. He said he gave up filmmaking because his audience was gone. He was referring to the Holocaust and the extermination of 6 million Jews."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been enjoying films for 20 years now, and this is the first comment I&apos;ve put on any film website.  I&apos;ve always had the mickey taken out of me for loving this film, and it&apos;s right up there amongst my favourites of a very eclectic bunch.  Why?  Well, firstly and I have to say, very importantly, it&apos;s taken from the finest piece of modern literature I&apos;ve read.  Umberto Eco&apos;s novel has such mammoth scope of subject matter and detail, it is was always going to be extremely hard to put into film (Dune anyone??), and Annaud certainly doesn&apos;t succeed in every way, but my lord he gives it a damn good go. The film quite rightly focusses on the human story within the book of a group of murders committed at an Italian abbey in the 14th Century, and the ongoing search for the purpetrator, by a Franciscan monk and his apprentice. The book encompasses many other issues and plotlines, which could not be fitted into the film. The three screenwriters do an excellent job, of filming the almost impossible to within 2 hours or so. Most importantly to me, the cinematography and set are sublime, almost unsurpassed in modern film to my mind, and still to this day amazing. I&apos;ve always found that many non movie-lovers remember this film, for good or bad.  The main reason for me is that it recreates so impressively the period it represents. Tonino Delli Colli, I salute you. The production team deserves a similar merit for bringing together what was in essence an European co-production, whilst not forgetting the biggest exterior set built in Europe since &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Step forward Dante Ferreti. I salute you too. 0.1 of a mark off for the editing, but let&apos;s not dwell on that. The acting is, bar none, marvellous, with even Christian Slater in his first main role putting up an extremely decent stab of being an apprentice monk.\n\n I like a good whodunnit, but I adore a whodunnit which throws in the visual magnificence of a different age, top notch performances, a script taken from a extraordinary source, and assured directing. 10 out of 10, and my mates can carry on taking the mickey out of me.\n\nSo in summary, I&apos;ll leave it to the director himself.. `When I see a film, I love it when I&apos;m entertained, when I care for the actors, when I share their emotions, when I&apos;m scared, when I&apos;m in love, but also if I learn a little something, if I have the feeling that I haven&apos;t seen something before, and that&apos;s what `The Name of the Rose&apos; has.&apos;",

A middle-aged divorced man responds to an ad in the paper, placed by a younger woman who offers phone-sex. They make it weekly appointment and they quickly find out their whole lives turns around these weekly conversations now. They masturbate to each other&apos;s voice, argue about whether they depend on each other or not and then masturbate some more. Very boring and utterly annoying. Maybe it could have worked as a 5 (or max. 10 minutes) sketch in an educational talk show or something, but not as a full-length film.

The first half plays almost like a well-observed drama, but after Swanson has been &quot;resurrected&quot; the film becomes just too silly to work. The &quot;infamous&quot; basketball scene, however, is undeniably great; you&apos;ll have to rewind the tape multiple times to get the full effect of it!      (**1/2)",

This movie is a pseudo-lesbian themed movie that is well acted and directed, but beyond that has practically no substance.\n\nDivided into four stories without any real connecting theme or element, it seems to deprive the viewer of any gratification that other similar movies provide. This is not to say it isn&apos;t without any merit. All the actors do a good job, especially Sandrine Pinna and Karena Lam, despite either of them not really having much to do. The final story is the well directed, but it is also possibly the most hollow. Likewise, the pacing and scenery is good, same for most of the music and sound.\n\nThe only real complaint, is just after watching it you don&apos;t come away with anything substantial and maybe entertaining. That is a pretty big complaint.",

Strictly a tale of espionage shot in color at a time when most series were still in black and white, Barbara Rush playing a newspaper reporter who learns of an assassination plot at the United Nations, calling upon skeptical police lieutenant Hugh O&apos;Brian to help prevent the conspiracy. Eventually they manage to accomplish just that at a diplomatic reception, the villain revealed to be Neil Hamilton, previously a not very convincing baddie in 1959&apos;s &quot;The Devil&apos;s Hand&quot; soon to portray Commissioner Gordon on the hugely popular BATMAN. Neither the feature nor the episodes have turned up over the years, probably no great loss but still..."

      "reviewBody": "Rikidozan is a fascinating figure, a man whose very existence captures the schizophrenic love-hate of the self imbibed in the Japanese psyche. Emerging at a crucial period in Japan&apos;s post-war turmoil, he galvanised national pride by defeating bigger, stronger Americans one after another. The naivety of the ordinary masses buying into this manufactured folklore seems twee observed from this distance, but hunger for some kind of hope and national pride in those desperate times is impossible for current generations to imagine.\n\nThe film does a good job of depicting Rikidozan&apos;s rise to fame, his desire to succeed against discrimination and hierarchical relations, and the flaws in the man&apos;s character that would contribute to his downfall. Kyung-gu Sol in the lead perfectly captures the character. His Japanese is flawless, and he exhibits the hybridity of Rikidozan in his every gesture. Tatsuya Fuji as the oyabun who funds Rikidozan&apos;s path to glory is something we rarely see in films about Japan, a well-rounded, complex yakuza. He sees Riki as a business investment, but also has a surrogate parent-like affection for the man. But he never forgets his role as boss and mentor, and one of the tensions of the story is quite how long this man will go on protecting Riki.\n\nMiki Nakatani as put-upon wife Aya is quiet and mysterious. The film becomes more interesting every time she appears, but unfortunately her role is under-written, and the part does now do her acting skills justice.\n\nThe first 60 minutes expertly chronicle Riki&apos;s rise, the odds he faces, and the significance of all this to post-war Japan. In the last 30 minutes the film sags and a sentimental tone creeps in. This culminates in a last scene that literally looks like it was shot in a giant snow-globe, with toe-curling melodramatic music to match. A tighter edit, and more cinematic approach, could have made this tale truly memorable. However, while the story of Rikidozan grips you, the patchy pacing and average technical skills on display are slightly disappointing.\n\nAt a time when banal nationalism is rampant in Japan, Rikidozan&apos;s story is a sobering reminder of the complex realities that confound Japanese identity. On a human scale, it is also a competent depiction of how one man&apos;s hubris can lead to a fall.",

      "reviewBody": "From the director NIGEL COLE (Calendar Girls, Saving Grace), MADE IN DAGENHAM tells the tale of the 187 women that worked at the Ford Motor companies Dagenham factory - and their struggle to earn equal rights and pay with the 55,000 male workers at the factory. \n\nSet in 1968, the economy was used to frequent union uprisings and strikes – but this was the first time that it was the women upholsterers who sewed car seat covers that took the initiative  after being &quot;down-graded&quot; to a non-skilled status – the women rose as one to walk out, in an action that brought them into direct conflict with the management, their own unions and their own husbands  eventually brought the Ford motor company to it&apos;s knees \n\nMany laughed at the women&apos;s actions  until their strength of feeling  and reality set in  forcing the unions and the management to take increasingly desperate measures to get the women back to work  as factory production ground to a halt. \n\nRita O&apos;Grady (played admirably by SALLY HAWKINS), a shy, pleasant worker working in sweat shop conditions, found her voice when asked to stand up for the women&apos;s views, and gradually became more and more empowered as the rest of the women stood behind her in a crusade that became synonymous with equal rights\n\nThe story climax&apos;s nicely in an emotional showdown, as the situation finally comes to a head and the chief participants (Ford, the Government, the Women, the unions and the men workers) all realise that things have gone too far  and none of them can back down.\n\nAs well as Sally Hawkins, there are some strong performances by other members of the cast – specifically, Bob Hoskins as Albert, Miranda Richardson as an exuberant Barbra Castle, the lovely Rosamund Pike as Lisa, Geraldine James as Connie, Kenneth Cranham as Monty (Unions) and Richard Schiff as Robert Tooley (Ford).\n\nThe music, costumes and the locations set up the tone of the times nicely, and the direction is solid throughout. The camera work is able, and is interspersed with footage from the actual era giving it more gravitas.\n\nIn a phrase, it&apos;s  &quot;Girl Power – union style&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Having been one of the lucky ones to have spent considerable time on UK motorways at night (and specifically the M1) I was immediately intrigued by the locale for this debut horror from Mark Tonderai. For me the originality of setting alone sets this horror apart from the countless tired horror locations: the haunted house, the woods, the abandoned hospital, etc, etc.\n\nOverall the film is a fairly nuts-and-bolts by-the-numbers horror, which deserves credit for the originality of locale, decent performances, slick direction, with a few genuinely tense set-pieces (particularly the final showdown set-piece, which stands clearly above the rest). However, it is fairly unambitious with character detail (after the opening argument), and there are a few of the usual (and easily avoidable) horror clichés - we even get the hiding in the toilet cubicle sequence (albeit with a slight variation).\n\nYou get the sense that Tonderai had his set-up and finale worked out fairly early on but didn&apos;t know what to do with the story in between. The central third, while featuring a few decent scenes with the police, takes a couple of left turns into co-conspirator territory, alluding to a networked operation. The scenes with the security guards and the &apos;escaped&apos; girl feel like they were put in to fill time and up the body count rather than deepen the story as a whole. Personally I felt that a more stripped-down lone bad-guy approach would have been strong enough.\n\nThe film owes something to Spielberg&apos;s &apos;Duel&apos; in theme and narrative drive (no pun intended), and there are similarities in tone to the marginally superior Australian horror &apos;Wolf Creek&apos;",

The background music played with the tone of the scene just sets the movie. And every actor/ actress has given their best in the movie, especially Bharat Jadhav and Laxmikant Berde, I think this was the best work of Bharat Jadhav till date. The direction of Mahesh Kothare is at its best like always, he made sure the audience nevwr grow restless. After Zapadlela this was his best work. This was also the best cameo by him period, the way he narrates the past of the ghosts sets the tone for the rest of the movie.",

Jim (Morgan Freeman) leads a group of thieves looking to rob the the truck. They kill Charlie as Tom escapes with the money. Karen (Minnie Driver) knocks him out thinking he&apos;s a looter. \n\nThe story is contrived. Mikael Salomon is mostly a TV director. Compared to Graham Yost&apos;s earlier hit Speed, this has all the action but lacks the fun. Betty White is able to add a couple of laughs. The acting is perfectly fine although they&apos;re not doing any heavy lifting. The rainy water action gets a bit mind-numbing with its sameness.",

Every time I watch this film I get some new tiny detail that sends me into hysterical laughing fits. Watch out for the kick-the-can failures, the sweater struggle and candle cat or the poem designed to impress in Milan: &quot; so klein und gruen, wie Sie und ich&quot;  true art! (Plus homophile bonus: a hilarious Styrofoam version of Julie Andrews&apos; great &quot;Jazz Hot&quot; appearance in &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;.)

      "reviewBody": "The critics are being pretty harsh on this film, and yet they give high praise to such films like Role Models and Get Him to the Greek, so go figure. But I had a lot fun with Due Date, It was a fun slapstick misadventure, almost what we loved about The Hangover, so it is clear to say I don&apos;t agree with the critics on this one.\n\nPeter(Robert Downey Jr) an architect looking to get home to his pregnant wife(Michelle Monaghan) who is expecting in a week. And when he gets on a plane, he quickly gets kicked off, when he gets into an unfortunate incident with Ethan(Zach Galifianakis) a pot smoking moron, and wanna be actor, who is obsessed with the show Two and a Half Men. When Peter is looking for new ways to get home. Ethan has a car and offers to drive him. Although it is against Peters better judgment, but feeling there is no other way, he goes with him. Will Peter make it on time for his child&apos;s birth, or will Ethan drive him nuts during this?\n\nA lot of people said this is a Plane,Trains and Automobiles ripoff, but you know what who cares. This was a funny laugh out loud film. Downey and Galifianakis have funny chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly. Like The Hangover it is one entertaining misadventure, I say don&apos;t listen to the critics, see this movie and form your own opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "Paul (Joey Travolta) is an ace driver and at times an illegal and freelance racer, while Nick (Vittorio Mezzogiorno) is a wizard of mechanics, they form a perfect team of auto racers. By winning a rigged race and Paul had to leave victory to a rider of a team in the pay of a gangster named Wronsky (Ricardo Palacios), our friends are forced to temporarily erase circuits; to get away the wrath of Wronsky and his henchmen (Sal Borghese). Then the reckless drivers get involved with the usual gang of goons who proceed to make their life painful . Along their risked adventures they meet Janice Johnson (Ana Obregon), an antiques dealer, who falls in love for Paul. Thing go wrong when the three of them go to the house of the wealthy Kirby (John Steiner) and his snooty butler Gershwin.\n\nFormula thriller with noisy action , thrills , crisply edition , tension , intrigue , and loads of noisy races. A routine thriller dealing with the relationships between three friends: Joey Travolta, Vittorio Mezziogorno , Ana Obregón in the world of car racing competitions, accompanied by other prolific secondaries in a large number of Spag Westerns and other Latin sub-genres. The main duo Joey Travolta and Vittorio Mezzogiorno are threatened by a mobster not to participate in the car tournament called the &apos;Race of the Dead&apos;, but the stubborn pair are determined to compete at any cost. The picture was unevenly written by four screen writers: Marco Tullio Giordana, Massimo De Rita, Concha Espina and Margheritti himself, being regularly shot by Antonio Margheritti in his peculiar style .Antonio was considered to be one of the best Italian craftsmen , making a nice career, shooting all kinds of genres. Here he delivers frenetic action, suspense, thriller and violence enough along the nail-biting flick. There is a good stuntwork with risked races , pursuits and cars jumping here and there.\n\nThis is a mostly Italian film, in the early 1960&apos;s Italians made movies about Gladiators known as Peplum or Sword and Sandals , then they made Spaghetti Westerns , then Spy Movies , Gothic Horrors , War Flicks , Giallo Slashers , Crime Trash Epics or Poliziotto , Sex comedy , Rampaging Shark thrillers , Star Wars ripoffs , and eventually Racing Movies . This Car Crash(1981) belongs to car races sub-genre in which protagonists competing in dangerous circuits trying to force each other off the road, combined with a threatening mobsters subplot . Stars Joey Travolta as a brave racer whose role gets involved in problems when he&apos;s blackmailed along with Vittorio Mezzogiorno as the sympathetic expert on car mechanics. And there&apos;re various familiar faces, habituals of the prolific Italian and Spanish sub-genres of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, such as Ricardo Palacios, John Steiner, and the eternal secondary and stuntsman Sal Borgese. A nice cast in this one doing their bit , but the story is rather small scale and slightly dull and tiring in parts . It makes up for the excellent races taken from real competitions , though the car crashes are lousy stock footage , as well as the exciting climax final of the movie. And with some hilarious use of miniatures (of which the director was an expert with continuous use in his films, as well as explosions) and scale models of toy cars jumping over trains or cliffs.\n\nIt contains atmospheric and colorful cinematography by cameraman Hans Burmann. Likewise , catching and moving musical score in the Eighties style, composed by means synthesizer, including some songs at the time .The motion picture was average but professionally directed by terror/action/adventure expert Antonio Margheritti, and it displays some failures and flaws . Antonio was assisted by his son : Edoardo Margheriti who usually served as second unit filmmaker . Antonio often used pseudonym Anthony M Dawson, he was born in Italy 1930 and passed away in 2002 . Italian writer director of horror and exploitation films, a former university engineering student who began shooting in 1956 . Antonio directs with ordinary aplomb and being especially known for films as ¨Yor, Virus¨ and ¨Horror castle¨. He was specialist in model-making, optical effects , FX, miniature as floods, scale models and explosions . He directed all kinds of genres such as wartime : ¨The last hunter, Tornado, Codename Wild geese, Der Commander, Command Leopard¨ . SCI-Fi : ¨War of planets , Planet of the prowl, Criminal of the galaxy, Yor the hunter from the future, Treasure planet¨ . Spaghetti Western as ¨Joko, Dynamite Joe, The stranger and the gunfighter, Take a hard ride, Ghosts go west, Joe implacable, God said to Cain¨ . Terror as ¨Virgin of Nuremberg, Cannibal Apocalypse, Alien from deep, Flesh for Frankenstein¨. Action : ¨Operation Goldman, Indio, The squeeze, Cyberflic¨. Rating Car Crash(1981) : 4.5/10. Average but acceptable and passable, at times.",

A lovely 60&apos;s Stockholm and its Grand Hotel, an adorable and extremely beautiful Elke Sommer, a very young and charismatic Paul Newman, the glamour of the Nobel prize and lots of what we now a days consider that romantic innocence from the older times.\n\nThe movie itself is not exactly a good one. First of all you can notice that every scene outside is shot with a film behind so that very probably, Mr.Newman never got to go to Stockholm at all, but was filmed in some studio in Hollywood. Then all these stereotypes that are making angry to Italians, Swedes and even Danes. Well, take a look at any Hollywood movie happening in Spain and you will find see that those old stereotypes are there for every nationality and are certainly annoying. We are bullfighters here theoretically.\n\nThe plot is very simplistic, the bad guys are really clumsy, some scenes are taken from other movies and as mentioned before by someone else, it is a photocopy of Hitchcock&apos;s Torn Curtain as well.\n\nStill, as imperfect as it is, it is just lovely, and the little romance of Newman and Sommers, those innocent but very hot kisses dressing up so smart are worth the movie for those who feel romantic.",

      "reviewBody": "Beware!!! &quot;Boah fett - Dei Mudder sei Gesicht Part 2&quot; is out now and everybody who liked the predecessor will love the sequel!!!!!!! But let´s start from the beginning: &quot;Dei Mudder... &quot; is made by five guys who know each other from school. One day they decided to make their own movie - just for fun and for themselves. Then it continued with 4 or 5 copies I think, and a few months later it became the biggest hype in the German movie underground. Everybody between 15 and 27 knows this film or has heard of it. Youths find it hip to talk with the slang of the characters, and their are also a lot of persons, who know the dialogues from inside out. &quot;Dei Mudder...&quot; got some bad critics, because it´s often said, that it is hostile to foreigners. But when you watch this film you recognize exactly that this movie is only a satire and a parody. I personally think it´s the ideal party movie - invite some friends, drink some beer and you will laugh so hard, I promise!!! Although this film has got nearly no plot, the special FX are home made and all is filmed with a handy cam. But &quot;Dei Mudder...&quot; takes his charm from the fact, that everything looks so cheap and stupid. I know a lot of people who hate this film and say this shot could be done by everyone. Well, they are probably right, but the fact, that a &quot;primitive&quot; work like this one reached such an immense success is nearly a phenomenon. And it´s one of the greatest honors for director/script writer/actor Simon Mora and his guys to be in the archives of IMDb!!! My rating: Beyond heaven and hell...  (Cult factor: 101 %)."

      "reviewBody": "When thinking about this film, several words come to mind: cliched, contrived, and confusing, to name a few.  In most suspense thrillers, the audience finds itself yelling out advice to the main characters, such as &quot;don&apos;t go into the basement- the bad guy is there&quot; or &quot;save yourself! don&apos;t go back for your cat!&quot;  I never did that with this one.  It wasn&apos;t because the decisions this victim makes are any smarter than any other suspense thriller victim,  it was more that I just really didn&apos;t care what happened to her.  I couldn&apos;t feel any sympathy for her because she was so two-dimensional.\n\nThen let&apos;s consider the stalker.  He is supposed to make the viewer feel creepy just by being onscreen.  He is definitely no Anthony Hopkins or Jack Nicholson.  Frankly, I&apos;ve seen episodes of &quot;Mister Rogers&apos; Neighborhood&quot; that were creepier.  I&apos;m tired of actors who think it is easy to play a psychopath.\n\nThis film did have its bright spots, though they were few and far-between. One scene that I thought was very well-done (if slightly preposterous) took place in a church and involved a very cool priest.  I can say no more.\n\nI suppose I sometimes demand too much of made-for-TV movies.  In all honesty, I&apos;d have to say that &quot;made-for-TV suspense Velveeta&quot; is my favorite genre, and when viewed in its proper context (i.e. on cable at three in the morning), this film is a fine example of its genre."

      "reviewBody": "Pre-World War I, an Argentinian rancher&apos;s two daughters marry a Frenchman named Desnoyers and a German named von Hartrott. Desnoyers&apos; son Julio grows up to be a playboy, and moves to Paris to become a painter. Von Hartrott&apos;s sons go to Germany and serve the Fatherland. Julio begins an affair with a married woman, Marguerite Laurier. With the outbreak of war in France, Julio feels no responsibility to enlist, while von Hartrott&apos;s sons join the German army. Marguerite becomes a nurse for the Red Cross, and, ironically, tends to her injured husband, who was blinded in combat. Julio finally sees the light and joins the French army, and in the climax, comes face to face with one of his German cousins.\n\nUltimately, this is a depressing film, and somewhat emotionally draining, but it is impressive in so many ways. The cinematography is excellent, and the few battle scenes are realistic and well-staged. The biblical Four Horsemen make several appearances, with some clever trick photography. The romantic leads are fine (Terry is particularly lovely). But what made the film for me was the outstanding supporting cast, many of whom are not remembered today. Although there were so many characters it was sometimes hard to keep track of who was who, each one had an interesting storyline. Josef Swickard, as Julio&apos;s father, may well be the most pathetic character in the film. He has to suffer the humiliation of discovering his son is carrying on with a married woman. Later, his French home is virtually ransacked by the Germans. He is initially overjoyed to find that one of his nephews is a German officer, thinking this will spare him any atrocities. Fat chance. In one scene, weird even by today&apos;s standards, one of the Germans puts on a dress during a wild celebration in the house, while another officer (Wallace Beery) attempts to molest a young woman.\n\nAlan Hale, as the senior von Hartrott, is gung-ho on having his boys serve Germany, but at the end, he is a broken man, regretting that his family ever left Argentina.\n\nNigel De Brulier plays a mystical character who seems to foretell what is to happen.\n\nJohn St. Polis, who could easily have been cast as a villainous character, emerges as a sympathetic hero, and his later scenes with Alice Terry are quite touching.",

      "reviewBody": "`Berlin, Symphony of a Great City&apos; is a film I&apos;ve watched over and over with fascination.  I think it&apos;s true that it is not so much about the people of Berlin, although we see many of them, but the city itself as a huge living, breathing organism.  Back in the 1930s filmmaker John Grierson apparently wrote that this film `created nothing,&apos; and that it violated the first principles of documentary by showing us nothing of importance but beautiful images.  Looking at it more than 70 years after its creation, however, its documentary value seems evident to me, at least.  I find it fascinating just to see what the people, clothing, uniforms, vehicles, streets, parks, restaurants, shops, theaters, nightclubs, and factories looked like in that distant time and place.  It&apos;s amazing to contemplate how soon this complex, sophisticated society would be consumed in the most primitive debauchery. Do these people really look that much different from those we see on our streets every day?  It makes me wonder what we&apos;re all potentially capable of.\n\nSome slight differences do seem apparent, however.  When a fight breaks out in a public place today, people usually try to ignore it, or even duck their heads and run for cover.  But in a scene where two men argue violently in the street, the Berliners of the 1920s crowd in close around the combatants, and even try to separate them and arbitrate the dispute, before a policeman moves in.  Whether this was typically European at that time, or just typical of its era, I really can&apos;t say, but it seems strange to me today.\n\nAlthough I think the majority of this film was shot in a candid manner, and looks it, it&apos;s obvious that not quite all of it was un-staged, as a previous commentator has pointed out.  For example, look at the argument scene just mentioned.  Considering one of the camera angles (probably from a 2nd floor window), the argument must have been staged at the exact spot where this camera could catch it, and the crowd&apos;s reaction, from above.  In addition, a second camera was in place at street level to move in close, which hardly suggests a serendipitous event.\n\nA good musical score is vitally important to bring this film to life.  It&apos;s too bad the original score has been lost.  It would be fascinating to know what it was like.  But I think the one written by Timothy Brock for the Kino edition is superb in that it captures its changing moods and rhythms.  If, as one internet reviewer commented, it seems a bit melancholy, that may be apropos considering that this beautiful city, and a great many of its inhabitants, would be consumed in fire less than 20 years later."

      "reviewBody": "Dick is among one of the most charming satires of the nineties that I have seen, mainly because it does not stew in its indulgence and its leads are glowing and magnetic, making the film almost instantly win. The story behind those characters is intriguing nonetheless, involving the famous &quot;Watergate scandal&quot; that plagued and eventually ruined Nixon&apos;s presidency. It is also fitting to mention that Dick finally clears up the missing minutes from the &quot;Watergate tapes&quot; that any history buff or aspiring satirist would find hilarious.\n\nBetsy Jobs (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams) are almost like the female renditions of Beavis and Butthead. They are two young and naive fifteen year old girls, residing in the Watergate complex, who sneak down one night to mail a letter, securing the door with duct tape, only to evade getting caught because, conveniently, a group of burglars had broken in and were apprehended instead.\n\nThe next day, the girls&apos; class tours the White House, and the two get separated, overhear important, confidential conversations between officials, and eventually go on to meet the man himself, President Richard Nixon, played by the ever-so-talented and hilariously over-the-top Dan Hedaya. Nixon grows concerned about how much the girls know about this secret scandal, and kindly offers them the job of becoming the official White House dogwalkers, walking Checkers every day. They can&apos;t refuse - they are smitten by Nixon. Call him &quot;Dick.&quot; The film then connects all of the Watergate pieces together; how the scandal become known, how the tapes were discovered, the story of &quot;Deep Throat,&quot; and how two bumbling reporters (Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch) would become famous. All these pieces are put together to assure sly, devilishly intriguing satire of unbelievable proportions.\n\nBoth Dunst and Williams are one of the two key reasons why Dick is so buoyant and a capable satire. They ignite electric chemistry, immediately giving providing us with an overwhelming feel of hip sassiness, not to mention just their total confidence with this material. Let&apos;s just hope their fans will be attracted to this unique, extraordinarily different material. It worked for The Virgin Suicides, if we&apos;re talking about Dunst.\n\nThe second reason why the film maintains such a favorable status is Hedaya&apos;s exceptionally witty performance as Richard Nixon. Right down to his haircut and accent, Hedaya throws himself in this role, completely cementing the film&apos;s wonderful charm and essence. But let&apos;s not overlook that screenplay by Andrew Fleming and Sheryl Longin, which manages to direct itself away from satirical dead-ends, overwrought dialog, and complete heavy-handedness. This is certainly one of the feistiest, most intelligent pieces of comedy from the nineties.\n\nStarring: Kirsten Dunst, Michell Williams, Dan Hedaya, Will Ferrell, and Bruce McCullouch. Directed by: Andrew Fleming.",

Ole Bornedal simply wanted too much and accomplished too little in a movie jam packed with events but no background to explain them. I would have preferred he had left out a few and dwelled more on the characters. Apart from an intimidating Dina, who is portrayed brillantly by Maria Bonnevie, most other characters pop up and disappear without much focus on their inner mechanics. Most are simply treated as props. I must say, however, that Bjørn Floberg as Dina&apos;s father does an excellent piece of acting in bringing the character so much anger and ill feelings.\n\nThe locations and the craftsmanship of the movie in general, is admirable. Beautiful settings and what many have described as postcard like sceneries. A movie that could have touched its audience but failed nonetheless.\n\nMany have criticized the choice of language in this movie but I really don&apos;t think it did much harm, hearing a bunch of Nordic actors (and a French) speak English. Perhaps some of them might have been more comfortable speaking their mother tongue and thus acted more naturally, but who knows?",

      "reviewBody": "This film has celebrated its 30th anniversary on this 2006 New Year Eve, and there was a special programme about the creation of the film, actors etc. Apparently, the whole country (then USSR) watched it when it was first shown in 1976, and they wanted to see if the rating would be the same 30 years later. I have to say, I have been watching this film religiously since early teens every New Year and when I moved to live in the UK, the video recording of &quot;Ironiya&quot; was one of the essential items I brought with me. It&apos;s one of those films that I can watch over and over again, instant mood lifter, and I just can&apos;t imagine my New Year day / eve without it, and a bottle of &quot;Soviet&quot; champagne, and Russian salad, and the proverbial Jellied fish that Ippolit referred to as &quot;muck&quot; (I think the closest translation I can think of). On my way back from Moscow to London in Janaury, I tried to purchase a DVD copy in the airport but was told by the assistant that they are permanently sold out!!!",

I read the book several years ago &amp; have been a Frida fan ever since.\n\nI heard an interview w/Hayden on NPR not too long ago talking about her book &amp; the movie adaptation.  She did years &amp; years of research on Frida and is probably as close to an &apos;expert&apos; on her life as we could come across in the year 2003.  She praised Julie Taymor for this film and was quite happy with her adaptation.\n\n Reading the reviews on this page, i find it hard to believe that there are critics of this movie.  Everything from the music (beautiful!) to the cinematography to the acting . . . greatness!!  Selma really put her heart &amp; soul into this role and she has now made her way onto my list of &apos;favorite actresses&apos;.\n\n It would be hard to put anyone&apos;s life onto the big screen &amp; get every single detail right on - esp. someone who lived 50+ years ago. I think Julie Taymor has done an amazing job of representing the life of Frida."

Bond follows clues across the globe while dodging Drax&apos;s assassins including Jaws (Richard Kiel). Along the way, CIA agent Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) joins forces with Bond.\n\nThere are a lot of hot girls in this one. Maybe that&apos;s why Lois Chiles don&apos;t stand out as a Bond girl. In this one, I remember much more of Jaws&apos; girl Dolly. And quite frankly, Jaws remains the greatest Bond villain henchman ever.\n\nThe story is convoluted, and outlandish. They&apos;ve literally gone out into space. The action is stretching out into exotic sightseeing. This is the formula now especially for Roger Moore. It works for a Bond movie. It&apos;s an escapist adventure.",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone even vaguely interested in British horror cinema will be well acquainted with the resume of Michael Reeves. Retrospectively crowned the great white hope who-never-was by genre commentators like Kim Newman and Allan &apos;Dark Side&apos; Bryce, Reeves&apos; work showed the promise of an English Spielberg. Or possibly just another Peter Sasdy. Unfortunately we&apos;ll never know, as his life was truncated by an overdose of sleeping pills. But on the evidence of this film and it&apos;s successor,&apos;Witchfinder General&apos;, it&apos;s clear that he possessed a genuinely cinematic imagination to rival young Steven&apos;s. A quality all too rare in British film.\n\n&apos;Witchfinder&apos; is good. Very good. But on balance I prefer this piece. Perhaps that&apos;s partly a personal reaction to the rather inflated claims made for Reeves&apos; last film by certain critics, who seek to present it as the work of a suicidal soul-in-torment auteur. C&apos;mon fellas. &apos;The Sorcerers&apos; is quirky and takes itself slightly too seriously, resulting in a strange, enjoyably naive atmosphere. I particularly enjoy the unique screen presence of Victor Henry, who plays Ian Ogilvy&apos;s ginger haired friend Alan. I was saddened to learn (via the ever-educational IMDb) that he was involved in a road traffic accident not too long after making this film, and spent the last 17 years of his short life in a vegetative state. Another potential talent lost.\n\nIgnore the wits who claim that this is a work which dissects and critiques the function and form of cinema itself, etc, etc. These people create subtexts for Pete Walker films in their spare time. Enjoy it simply as a movie where Ian Ogilvy listens to Cliff Richard&apos;s &apos;Out in the country&apos; on his dansette, and then slashes up Susan George with a pair of scissors.\n\nHey. &apos;Wired for sound&apos; gets me the same way."

      "reviewBody": "I’d always been interested in this one – not least because it involves twins (and, thus, reminiscent of the Boris Karloff vehicle THE BLACK ROOM [1935]) – so that when I came across the film, even if I knew that the quality would be far from optimal, I leapt at the chance to acquire it. While not strictly horror, it involves several elements that are part and parcel of the genre – old dark house, family secret, madness, murder, mob fury, etc.\n\nDespite, as I said, the fact that the video was rather fuzzy – so that the images generally lacked detail – I was nonetheless struck by the film’s cinematography and editing: these were particularly effective during a scene at a bar, where the mad brother (who had been secluded all his life but has now broken loose) is ridiculed by the customers, and the one following it where he chases a girl into an alley and kills her. The two central roles are played by Albert Dekker and he does very well by both, though the mad brother is obviously the showier character – which he invests with a remarkable vulnerability (when seeing the locals indulging in a particularly animated jitterbug routine, he naively asks his future victim who’s accompanying him at the time “What are they doing?”); incidentally, despite the narrative’s Gothic – or, more precisely, Southern – trappings, the setting is a contemporary one.\n\nThe supporting cast is a good one and includes: a young Susan Hayward (that is, before she became, the First Lady of Screen Melodrama) as the perky small-town girl who entrances the crazy Dekker – which she’s all-too-willing to play up to, but who promptly and fiercely turns against him when he’s eventually revealed to be the cause of the terror which has gripped the community!; Harry Carey in the ambivalent role of the town doctor who, having been complicit in the cover-up of the mad brother’s existence, fears the repercussions of this act if he were to intervene when – at the satisfactorily frenzied climax – the good Dekker is accused of his brother’s crimes!; and the troubled Frances Farmer who, however, is wasted in the colorless role of the innocent sibling’s wife (in a virtual prerequisite of genre heroines, the actress is also asked to scream – which she does unconvincingly! – in her one scene with the mad Dekker).\n\nThe film is a Paramount production and, therefore, currently owned by Universal; while the latter have served their horror back-catalogue reasonably well on DVD, the equivalent stuff from that other studio has been consistently (and bafflingly) neglected over the years – especially since this includes such highly-desirable titles as ISLAND OF LOST SOULS (1932), MURDERS IN THE ZOO (1933) and, now, AMONG THE LIVING itself...",

It was so intense, real and full of emotions, that it&apos;s even impossible to feel untouched by it. The acting was perfect, the storyline direct and the story was frighteningly real. The character of Josephine was believable mainly because of the pain and suffering she has been through. This movie reminds me of Black Swan, but the main difference is that Black Swan was more abstract and visual. Black Swan was interwoven by Nina&apos;s hallucinations, we saw mainly her broken perspective of the world. Die Unsichtbare is more real and therefore even more emotional. Josephine is played very well by young actress Stine Fisher Christensen, and as a psychotic directer shined Ulrich Noethen. This movie is not for everyone, it&apos;s really rough (the last half hour mainly) and emotionally smashing, even more than Black Swan.",

      "reviewBody": "From Russia With Love is directed by Terence Young and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum &amp; Johanna Harwood from the Ian Fleming novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Lotte Lenya, Robert Shaw &amp; Pedro Armendáriz. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.\n\nJames Bond&apos;s second cinematic outing has 007 sent on a mission to Istanbul to try and acquire a Russian cypher machine known as Lektor. It&apos;s a trap set up by SPECTRE, who formulate a plan to upset the world order whilst murdering Bond in revenge for his killing of their agent Dr. No.\n\nSpy Hard! A certain JFK had announced From Russia With Love as being one of his favourite books, thus making the minds up of producers Broccoli &amp; Saltzman to make Fleming&apos;s Cold War thriller the follow up to Dr. No. It&apos;s a favourite of many a Bond aficionado because it represents one of the few occasions where Bond was still down to earth as a person, a hard working agent forced to do detective work. The adaptation is very literate as well, with a high fidelity to the source material a major bonus to Fleming&apos;s fans. The story is tautly told, often with dark tints the deeper Bond gets into things, and a number of excellently constructed set pieces fill out the latter half of the picture. It&apos;s not hard to understand why Connery cites this as his favourite Bond film.\n\nThough it is mostly free of the gadget excess that would become a trademark of the franchise, it&apos;s still very much a quintessential Bond movie. Exotic locations and exotic foes, eye poppingly gorgeous ladies (Bianchi smouldering like few others can), pre-credits sequence, the snazzy title credits (here on a dancing lady), title song crooned by a big name (Matt Munro), Barry&apos;s blending of the Bond theme into the score, Blofeld (a faceless Anthony Dawson) and an impressive cast list. One of the film&apos;s big strengths is the cast assembled, Connery (firmly moving into iconic realm) is aided considerably by the presence of Lenya, Shaw and Armendáriz, while the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Boothroyd (latterly to be known as Q) is a telling point in the series.\n\nWith a $2 million budget in the coffers, the makers were able to really push the boat out technically, and so they were rewarded as the pic went on to gross nearly $79 million Worldwide. Crucially it became apparent that James Bond was popular outside of Britain, the template had been set, what would they do with the next Bond outing we all wondered? 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This French-Russian production is a visually stark and potent film about life in post-Soviet (and pre-Putin) Russia. The main character is Andrei, a young, anti-semitic Muscovite bodybuilder who is the leader of a gang whose goals is showing brute Russian strength. They live in Luna Park, an amusement park, a place of wild rollercoasters and distorting mirrors, where they regularly beat up on &quot;non-Russians,&quot; the foreigners and Jews who come there. During a drunken confessional, a close relative tells Andrei that his father is a Jew and still alive in Moscow.\n\nThis fact turns Andrei&apos;s life upside-down, partly out of revulsion from whom he is descended, and partly because he wants to know (and be) with his father, and he must someway reconcile himself with this with discovery.\n\nThe film is not one necessarily of thoughtful, quiet introspection, but of hijinx, clashes, and turmoil, and interactions. Andrei vacillates between his role as the participatory leader of a brutal gang, and that of a son learning about his father. Without giving away too much information, Luna Park, the amusement park where the action begins, is where the climax happens, and is a metaphor for Russia and what it has to face.\n\n&quot;Luna Park&quot; may not be a pretty film. There&apos;s the ugly side to the human nature depicted in the skinheads brutal actions and the decay of Russian society blamed on &quot;non-Russians.&quot; But the majority of the film regards Oleg&apos;s journey and transformation as he gets to know his father, and this is the rewarding, and ultimately beautiful side of the film.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, I want to apologize, at the same time show appreciation for a movie that never came out in my country before I saw it. I hope someday it will just as the first one was.\n\nSpirited sequel. If you liked the first (Fantastic Journey to OZ) it&apos;s definitely worth checking out as it picks up after the events of the first film.\n\nDorothy has a guy-friend that is a bit clumsy and doesn&apos;t have much confidence or assertiveness to him. Through a series of accidents the two find themselves trapped in OZ split apart. This happens while Urfin is working out his escape from prison and into his next mischievous plan to take over Emerald City.\n\nMost of the film follows Tim as his many gullible blunders lead him to learn to find himself just as Dorothy sets off to find him. Hopefully the two can fix things and return home.\n\nHonestly, this film wasn&apos;t bad for a sequel. There were some cringe jokes that didn&apos;t quite hit, but nothing bad ever featured in the film. It was still a lot better than a lot of other OZ related films that had come out over the years. It&apos;s a shame that audiences didn&apos;t seem to like it. I&apos;m not an OZ fan, but I enjoyed watching both Fantastic Journey and Return to OZ and would have liked to see what they had next. But for what it&apos;s worth I want to thank the filmmakers for providing these fun family-friendly films that I&apos;m sure to enjoy for years to come.",

It&apos;s all pretty ingenious.\n\nJohn Goodman plays a cartoon-like role, a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors, with a setting of 1940s Britain. I first saw this on VHS and then later on DVD, which was improvement not only video-wise, but audio, too, as it somehow went from mono to surround sound. This might be considered a kids movie but a lot of the humor is more adult-oriented.",

No throw-away romantic interest. No noticeable special effects. No wisecracking. No mood music telling you what to feel.\n\nSo, if you&apos;re used to recent Hollywood fare, it may seem slow.\n\nBut, to this noir-lover, it feels fresh, yet as gritty as a run-down apartment in a hundred year-old building.",

Truly, he was.  Here, with the filmization of Sidney Kingsley&apos;s stage play about a NYC police station, focusing on the amazingly bad day which has been happening to Detective Kirk Douglas, Wyler shows his skill and diversity.\n\nKirk Douglas is the vision of a crumbling spirit disguised by toughness and authority.  He towers over a stellar cast, including Eleanor Parker as his wife, William Bendix as one of the other officers in the precinct, and Lee Grant as an inexperienced shoplifter.  The one actor who truly stands out from the rest is Joseph Wiseman, who is simply a spark plug made up as an actor, giving an astounding recreation of his stage role as an on-edge, cheap suit-wearing thief.  He displays the physical dexterity of James Cagney in the physique of a beanstalk, and proves to be more dangerous than any other movie crook we&apos;d seen in the past.\n\nIn one of the great Oscar follies of our time (and there were many), the 1952 voters neglected to nominate Douglas as Best Actor, or Wiseman in a supporting slot.  Nominations were given out for Wyler&apos;s direction, the screenplay, and for Parker and Grant, lead and supporting actresses respectively.  None for Best Picture, the other nominations were passed over in favor of &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.  And who was picked for Best Picture?  Well, staying true to AMPAS&apos;s mission of picking only the most harmless movie of the year (&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;), instead of the best, they picked &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, which will be remembered by film historians as merely a rehearsal for &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "A stunning debut by this young writer-director -- Dostoyevskian themes, an exact sense of place, and a lyricism touched by few of his peers.  And now six years&apos; wait!\n\nWhile most U.S. indie filmmakers spent the 1990s studiously copying Tarantino, Gray in this overlooked gem created something entirely different: a character study of tragedy among the unhip and uncool.  Torn by illness and the return of a prodigal son, a Russian immigrant family in New York tries to outlast the omens promising its destruction.  The film owes something to Coppola, but you might feel the presence of Bergman, too. Unsentimental, unsparing, with brilliant performances by the principal cast. A must see.",

Her clicking knitting needles in the jury box, her one dissenting vote invalidating the whole judicial process, her self righteous oblivion to the glares of the judge, are comedic timing at its best. Her scenes with the company are wonderful and her slow, methodical denouement of the murderer exquisite.\n\nJust curl up with this one. Great old actors from the sixties. A brilliant series. 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw A.P.E.X. a long, long while back, I couldn&apos;t have been more than about 10 years old at the time and my understanding of it was negligible. All I really remembered was cool robots and a complicated story involving time travel and a plague, which was about enough to convince me to give it a second shot when it appeared on TV, since the passage of years has given early 90&apos;s straight to video science fiction of this sort a curious fascination for me that actually outstrips the excitement that they originally induced. Remarkably A.P.E.X. actually repaid my interest, its certainly no classic but as far as its genre goes it certainly ain&apos;t too bad. The key is the plot, the film deals in a pretty interesting science fiction concept with a neat emotional hook for its main character. Basically, a mishap involving an exploratory time travelling robot results in our hero landing in a parallel reality that has branched off from his own, confronting him with his greatest fear, that of losing his beloved wife. The film tries to deal with post apocalyptic themes, parallel worlds and the consequences of paradoxes upon the time line, and though it can&apos;t quite keep itself together its imaginative and intriguing stuff. The plot actually holds up better than a number of reviews here would suggest, although there are one or two notable holes and clear contrivances. Despite problems the ambition is laudable, it&apos;s just a shame that the same ambition didn&apos;t carry over to the action, which mostly consists of repetitious shoots outs with robots. The pyrotechnics budget was clearly decent so there are plenty of explosions, plus the robots are pretty cool, shining golden creates with ridge plated armour and both shoulder and hand cannons. But the action gets dull pretty quickly and neither the robots nor humans have realistic or interesting tactics. Acting turns do a better than expected job of sustaining interest, though nobody is much more than merely &quot;there&quot; certain of the cast do convey a certain sympathy and interest. Richard Keats for example as the hero, he can&apos;t put across much reaction to the situation but is likable enough, Lisa Anne Russell has a sullen attractiveness, Marcus Aurelius appropriately grating as the token a-hole character, it&apos;s all fair enough for this level of film. Some of the writing works, some doesn&apos;t and while I appreciated that the film wasn&apos;t bogged down with techno-babble it could have done with a bit more explanation. The direction from Philip J. Roth (who turned out to be a low budget sci fi regular and also wrote the film) is occasionally stylish in its use of lighting, with green, red and dark moments put to good effect, he has a fair handling on atmosphere but I wish he had put more flair into the action. Altogether I thought this was a fair enough film. Only likely to appeal to sci fi buffs and they&apos;ll probably have a field day tearing it apart, but I had a reasonable enough time. 5/10 from me then.",

Director Bolognini probably intended the hospital to represent a microcosm of the Italy of the times. The doctor is working on the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a physical virus that can be isolated and treated. This controversial film examines the repressive mechanisms common to fascism and institutional psychiatry. The doctor is loved by three women and has simultaneous affairs with a nurse, a nymphomaniac, and the hospital director&apos;s wife. Although somewhat sensationalized, this film was made by a director of some renown, Mauro Bolognini, who gave us gems like BELL&apos;ANTONIO (also with Mastroianni), LA GRANDE BOURGEOISE, METELLO, AGOSTINO, and LA VIACCIA."

Any references I&apos;ve come across in film guides have been pretty dismissive, and it seems to have been rubbished on its release. I think &quot;minor classic&quot; is the perfect description for it: it&apos;s so pleasantly low-key, restrained and, well, English. It respects the tradition of farce and, despite the frenetic pace and the subject matter, retains a kind of gentle, even staid appeal. The race to get to the conference might be nail-biting but the sleepy English countryside, the apple-eating farmer, the scene of John Cleese soaking in a bath-tub, evoke a world of endearing laziness. A film for bank holidays, and perhaps more suited to TV than the cinema. A Fish Called Wanda has funnier moments but, on the whole, I think I prefer this.\n\nInteresting that so many people have said they can watch it again and again. I&apos;ve seen it four or five times and I&apos;m planning on buying it on my way home from work today, then watching it over dinner. Don&apos;t know what made me think of it and look it up. Actually I saw it being given away free with a newspaper last week, that must be it. I wasn&apos;t going to add to a tabloid&apos;s circulation, though.",

      "reviewBody": "From director Walter Salles comes a very moving road journey which had me completely spellbound by the end and I&apos;m sure would gain many viewer&apos;s hearts as the infamous director dives deep into many different issues. \n\nThe story centres around two young doctors going on a motorbike journey around the world, not for personal gain but for the experience. This idea was completely outstanding. It gives the audience an understanding of young people&apos;s desires, not for personal gains such as money but for an experience into real life issues and wishing to know more about the world around them. These ideas I&apos;m sure would make viewers aspire to be like the central characters to go out and explore the world and that was a reason why I personally loved this drama, because it gives inspiration to the audience and really moves them in a way which will leave you completely spellbound. \n\nThe film centres on many issues but one which stuck out for me was the heavy ideologies of health. In the year 1950 there were many health issues present in the poorer counties such as Peru and this Oscar winning drama is able to capture these issues magnificently. The two central protagonists are doctors and are wishing to help others with their knowledge and expertise as they explore the less fortunate countries to help with the many depressing health problems the countries are experiencing. There is a very highly emotional driven scene when the lead character tries to help a very ill woman who is refusing to be treated. Tensions are always running high in the latter stages of the film when many issues are wishing to be resolved and the central protagonists are putting themselves on the line to help the ill residents of the poor countries. \n\nHaving changes in situations was a very powerful technique. The characters experience a poor life and a rich life. Audiences will see different perspectives of life in the 1950s when seeing there are poor and rich countries and are divided by the smallest differences, such as illnesses. We also see more joyous moments and highly emotional driven scenes which also gives a sense of how life is, the good and bad sides are both expressed in equal amounts which in my opinion was a fantastic move and will capture your heart as it did mine\n\nCentred on the 1950s the film captured the essence of the politically driven time beautifully. Audiences see job issues, money problems and country matters which all juxtapose perfectly to capture the essence of the time and crate a high realism in context of the time\n\nThe acting by everyone involved is absolutely outstanding and it confused me when not one received an Oscar nomination because Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna are remarkable as the two travellers. Both dealing with their own issues we see different types of characters but similar characteristics to which made the film more believable of society where opinions are divided but also shared. \n\nBernal plays a character who is always saying what he feels and is never wishing to back down from anyone or anything and he pulled it off tremendously. The passion he creates as the central protagonist Guevara is utterly astonishing as he deals with asthma problems, love lives and money issues. It&apos;s a lot for him to take as he realises how serious life can be. Serna to also pulls off a classic performance as the older more experienced of the two who is always looking for that little bit more than his fellow traveller. \n\nUsing different countries such as Peru, Venezuela, and Spain allows viewers to gain an insight into the vastness of life. Using poor countries as well as rich countries allows viewers to see different sides to the world in the 1950s and was pulled off greatly. The characters can therefore experience what a posh life is like as well as what life in the fast lane gives them. The camera work is astonishing. Shooting from Venezuela, Peru etc we see different perspective of the countries. The scenery is always beautiful with shots of the towns in a poor state and the general background of the countries is to be admired. The shots of the bike on the roads are to be admired. The camera moves adjacent to the bike giving the realistic effect of the bike moving fast along the empty roads, gaining a sense of freedom and enjoyment. \n\nFrom watching this film I can say I have been inspired to get on a motorbike and explore the world. Seeing what the central protagonists saw will inspire many as it has inspired me and I have no hesitation in recommending this Oscar winning drama to anyone.",

The plot deals with the experimental phase of flying military equipment, of which the United States had inferior quality and little quantity in 1938. In the interest of progress, test pilots were willing to take to the air and strain both themselves and their equipment beyond normal bounds. The mythology is enhanced by the prologue in terms of the lack of the publication of &quot;the specifications of government aircraft.&quot; It is probably just as well since America&apos;s enemies generally had better aircraft before the American involvement, except perhaps for the C-47 and the B-17. This initial disclaimer only sharpens the fiction of the film. The movie is worth a look if one is even mildly interested in aircraft lore."

But, having met Pagel, the end of a loveless romance is just the beginning of a real one, and Anna hasn&apos;t had to make any sacrifices to save her father.\n\nReleased in the US in 1938 but had no English titles. Three different trade reviewers (of three) praised the direction by Bela Gaal and the handling of the principal role by Miss Tokes."

It&apos;s not going to win an Oscar for acting but it sure gets my vote for light entertainment. I liked the music from both Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift; they have different styles.\n\nI&apos;m am puzzled at the number of men who are reviewing a movie that is designed for little girls. I selected a couple of the reviewers who gave the movie one star and looked up some of their other reviews. I one case, his favorite movie contained a lot of violence and bloodshed.\n\nAt any rate, I give it an eight because it successfully did what it set out to do.

      "reviewBody": "An adaptation of Dan Millman&apos;s best-seller &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior¨ . It deals with handsome Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) who has it all : good physical and a shot at the Olympic team on the rings . Only one man shakes his fate , a chance encounter with a stranger changes the life of the college gymnast . As an anonymous night gas station attendant, nicknamed Socrates (Nick Nolte) , keeps questioning every assumption in his destination . Then a motorcycle crash breaks Dan&apos;s legs , and his bright future in Olympic Games . Now Socrates&apos;s life coaching is to make or shatter Dan&apos;s revised objectives .\n\nThis agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly its interesting issues , however resulting to be heavily developed and full of philosophical themes . The movie works at usual manner , though contains weird events and packs good feeling . Stirring and enjoyable screenplay by Kevin Bernhardt , an usual actor and art martial fighter . Good main cast as Nick Nolte as the rare trainer Socrates , furthermore a beautiful Amy Smart . Secondary appearance of young actors as Agnes Bruckner , Paul Wesley and the coach , well played by Tim DeKay . Director Salva frequently works with &apos;Ray Wise&apos; who as usual plays a brief acting as a doctor . And the author of the book on which the film is based, Dan Millman , can be glimpsed for a brief moment as the driver of the car at the gas station when Dan exercises for the first time after his motorcycle crash.\n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by Victor Salva , he tries for profundity at the end and blow it. Salva is an expert on suspense&apos;s creator of atmospheres, such as he proved in : ¨The nature of the beast (1995)¨, which Salva wrote and directed, starred Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts and quickly became New Line Cinema&apos;s biggest direct-to-video title of that year, ¨Powder¨, ¨Rites of passage¨ and ¨Clownhouse¨. His next film, this ¨The peaceful Warrior¨ (2006) , was very significant to him because of the year he spent in prison , he credits the original story as &quot;a story that changed my life&quot;. Rating : acceptable and passable , but especially appointed to gymnasts .",

The on/off 3rd person narrative, a common technique used for book-to-film conversion, worked better and better throughout the movie. The story itself didn&apos;t really get a hold of me though, this might stem from the fact that it was made for a public who to a great extent had already read the book. If you&apos;re a fan of Danish movies from the 60ies (about Denmark in the 30ies), or something similar, I guess it&apos;s worth buying.\n\nI have to add to this that Finn Storgaard, the main character, acts and looks like Jude Law in more than one of the latter&apos;s movies, e.g. The Talented Mr. Ripley and Enemy at The Gates. If you can see past the difference of settings, as Midt i en Jazztid only contains somewhat everyday scenes, I think that some similarities are quite obvious.\n\nAlso, the movie was awarded with the Bodil award, the Danish movie award.",

      "reviewBody": "Dhoom3 is a classic. I was never a fan of Dhoom1 and 2. Dhoom 3 is simply superb thanks to Aamir Khan and Jackie Shroff. This film is like watching any Hindi classic of 1970-85 period (of Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra and not of Mithun). Jackie Shroff&apos;s acting was another highlight and Jackie&apos;s acting resembled /infact reminded me of the intense acting of Rajesh Khanna. Hope this time every award show gives away Best actor award to only one man Aamir Khan and Jackie gets award for supporting actor. Situations have been deliberately created to ensure the police team of Abhishek and Uday catch Aamir. The only weakness in the film is the introductory action - scene of Abhsihek and Uday - which was pathetic. Direct Robbery scenes have not been shown - now that&apos;s okay as we have many other films showing how thieves rob and so is not a flaw!! Abhishek,Uday,Katrina don&apos;t have much to do. Katrina has been made to dance very well. This film is a must watch. Worth watching in theaters. After long time a film from which my eyes never ever strayed from the screen. A clean family entertainer. Music of the song Tu Hai junOon was great. Worth your money. Plus point is Aamir Khan&apos;s characterization of his double role of Sahir and Samar and strong story-line.\n\nI Guess all those reviews - which say the film has goof-ups and term the film a disaster - r plain idiots.Those who love films of 1970-85 would like dhoom 3. This film is way above Chennai Expres or Kirsh 2 and 3. if this film is called a disaster then may be people&apos;s tastes have changed- they want vulgar scenes and jokes or 3rd rate Masala film (like Rowdy Rathore or Grand Masti or Ek Tha Tiger or Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani or expect that length of the film to be below 2 hours)."

Done with much comedy and funny action (and a little bit of insignificant drama), this one is a film that can be watched again and again and still be an absolute treat. The film has a story, and the greatest thing about it is that it actually does not even matter. This film is made for fun, and succeeds thoroughly for that purpose.\n\nAnd what does it have to work as much as it did? Well, it has a Shahrukh Khan (sorry, The Shahrukh Khan), two cool youngsters (Zayed Khan and Amrita Rao), a sexy and classy chemistry teacher (Sushmita Sen), a hilarious spit-spraying teacher (Satish Shah), another funny elderly teacher (Bindu), and a motherly, warm Kirron Kher. \n\nShahrukh is as always great and is fairly restrained in this role, Sushmita is damn too hot to handle, Zayed and Amrita suit their parts, Kirron is lovable as usual, Satish Shah and Bindu will have you floored, and Sunil Shetty will annoy you as he does in most of his films. \n\nThe film has an amazing soundtrack with many catchy songs composed by Anu Malik. It has a twisted, messy and senseless story that manages to provide utmost fun and pastime, and it has many great and heart-warming moments. It flows very well throughout with all the nice songs and the rather humorous proceedings. \n\nFilms are made mainly to entertain us. This film does not take itself too seriously and it is not to be taken seriously. It has some inexplicable and genuine sense of fun, and as such, can be rightfully called a successful, special and very profound Hindi entertainment.",

I&apos;m watching Lamorisse&apos;s films in the recently released Criterion collection and this is easily my favorite apart from The Red Balloon. Its characters/acting can be a little silly at times, but this just gives the film a sense of whimsy. The beauty on-screen here really captured me. It wasn&apos;t until halfway through the film that I started to become aware of how much I was enjoying it - it has a hypnotic quality. I felt like I was in a sidecar on the balloon (how they got some shots blows my mind).\n\nThis is a very nice movie to be enjoyed with kids on a quiet weekend.",

      "reviewBody": "A teenaged girl out to discover womanhood early takes refuge from home and friends in her aunt&apos;s dilapidated, poverty row hotel.  The hotel houses a bizarre assortment of characters including a photographer wearing nothing but black leather and never saying much, a drunk who leaves bottles out in the hallway, a reverend who has tons of homo-erotic art and photographs pasted on his walls, a handicapped woman constantly crying for her Alice to return, and, of course, Aunt Martha, the proprietor.  Aunt Martha is a heavy-set woman who preaches about the way things used to be and how her hotel is a place for respectable people not tramps and the like.  Lucille Benson plays Martha and does an incredible job with what is really a difficult role.  Martha is a complex character of old-fashioned values being fused with strong sexual repression.  She is in many ways a man trapped in a woman&apos;s body.  Think about that when you finish the film.  Benson has a grand presence on screen and such a distinctive voice.  The rest of the acting is generally good as well.  Stanley Livingston(Chip from My Three Sons) has a small role.  Director Paul Bartel does a fine job capturing the perverse nature of the inhabitants of the hotel.  Each seems to have some seedy perversion.  The hotel sets the mood perfectly as it is grand in stature and just as filthy in reality.  Bartel uses genuine horror and some really dark humour together.  In one scene a boy&apos;s head is lopped off quickly.  A rat is pushed down a garbage disposal.  Bartel also uses some nifty lines like when an elderly woman cries for her Alice, someone says, &quot;Alice doesn&apos;t live here anymore.&quot;  A weird, quirky film whose atmosphere, direction, and a real creepy performance by Lucille Benson carry it beyond the ordinary and into the area of cult classic."

While I enjoyed the first film, I didn&apos;t think it was any masterpiece and this film follows the law of diminishing returns in that everything we see is less, not more.\n\nThere&apos;s a greater focus on silly comedy here, as in the nonsensical dream sequence that re-introduces Douglas&apos;s character, and the characters seem more shrill and annoying than we saw previously. The story this time around takes place in the Mediterranean and North Africa, but the plot is even more lightweight and superfluous than before and there&apos;s precisely nothing to remember it by. It&apos;s pretty well paced, for sure, but in all other respects it&apos;s a forgettable film: a cheesy &apos;80s grab for cash and nothing else.",

Raab and Dico have pretty hilarious characters and Bam and Ryan are a little more..normal..sort of, but whatever they&apos;re just cool people in general.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bomb finally got me&quot; is a phrase used in the film by the survivors of Hiroshima as they succumb to radiation sickness years later. Americans prefer their stories of historic disaster, Titanic or Pearl Harbour, to lead towards catastrophe, to build up to it and give it final word as though it&apos;s the main attraction. Imamura opens Black Rain on the fateful 6th of August 1945, it gave me chills to read that title because as a Japanese professor hurries on his way to the train station one can imagine the engines of Enola Gay whirring a few thousand feet above in the air, and probably a clicking noise which no one can hear and now the plane&apos;s hatch opens to drop Little Boy, and the professor looks at a clock in the train station and doesn&apos;t even have a way to know that life as he knows it will be over in approximately 45 seconds. \n\nImamura gets over with destruction in the first reel, but he doesn&apos;t get over with death. This is a movie that takes place in 1950, five years after the Bomb razed Hiroshima to the ground, and the Bomb still looms heavy over everyone&apos;s life, like something foreboding and inescapable that you can only see with the corner of the eye, and Imamura&apos;s quiet domestical drama takes place in the shadow of all that so that life and death don&apos;t happen in one final upflare of heartbreaking disaster but in spite of it, in dogged defiance, on a bed in a quiet farmhouse in the countryside as though what happened five years before was only a bad dream.\n\nI read a review that said Black Rain shows Imamura&apos;s apprenticeship to Yasujiro Ozu like no other of his films, and that may be true, for the most part this is a quiet provincial drama about an uncle trying to marry his young niece to anyone who may have her while prospective grooms flee at the idea that she may be sick with radiation after her exposure to the black rain. But then Imamura cuts to flashbacks of a city in flames, cauterized victims of the blast staggering around blind, skin melting off their bodies, faces deformed. It&apos;s a monstrous sight of hell on earth, and it&apos;s amazing to me how restrained is Imamura, in both depicting carnage and evoking sympathy for the survivors, the sick and the mad, who must go on with their lives.\n\nFor people who have seen and loved Come and See, this should be an interesting counterpoint. In that film Elem Klimov doesn&apos;t spare us any details, wherever he can find atrocity he&apos;s there to show us; Imamura on the other hand shows us the tragedy of war for a moment and then lifts it from our eyes, as to the survivors, literally to inhabit the memory. This is life after death."

      "reviewBody": "Greer Garson is my favorite actress of all times, bar none. So many stars have looks and/or charisma, which exceed their talent. They achieve box office draw with these charms, but not so much on critical review. To me, Ms. Garson has it all -- and, as a matter of record, she has scored in both categories. She has such a dimensional, charming presentation, making her fascinating to watch. Along with that, she is quite skillful in portrayal.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer who mentioned Ms. Garson&apos;s color films forgot &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; from 1949. She did a Disney film much later, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; with Fred MacMurray, which was of course in color.\n\nThis film - Her Twelve Men - is perhaps one of the few weak links in her chain of memorable films. The problem of diminishing offerings became a rueful experience for every Hollywood actress during those decades of studio contracts. As has been stated here, she likely did it to fulfill her contract and to keep working.\n\nAlso, as the decade wore on, films became more daring, and Ms. Garson shunned the nudity and coarseness that was being introduced. She is credited with saying that motion pictures should reflect up to the sky, not down to the ground. I appreciate that sentiment. It was shared by others at that time as well.\n\nI think you have to appreciate Ms. Garson to go this film. It&apos;s just so boring. And, I just can&apos;t like Robert Ryan. A smile seems to be a rarity for his face. He has a critical sort of look while in repose, and appears downright nasty in his negative scenes. He seems very unattractive to me in general, mainly because of this.\n\nIf you have any competition for viewing at the time this one comes up, I&apos;d recommend going with the other one. It&apos;s not that it is so badly done particularly; it&apos;s just such a weak theme in general."

And then I want to add take both with a grain of salt and do your own independent research.\n\nBoth documentaries seem to give the perspective of either side without really painting a complete picture.\n\nViewing both really helps you understand that this situation is not black and white but a very complicated gray.\n\nA great podcast if you are looking to do more research on this topic and how the US Specifically has gotten involved in this conflict is Congressional Dish. This podcast also lists all of its sources (including congressional hearings, spending bills, everything is sourced). This podcaster is American and she does not dive too much into what Putin has done in this conflict but that is only because she operates on the fact that she has no control over Russia&apos;s government but since her (and all American&apos;s) tax dollars and her elected officials are making these decisions she is trying to inform other American&apos;s what is being done in our name.\n\nEpisode Numbers: 207, 244, 248.",
